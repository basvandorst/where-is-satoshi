In 1998 I invested almost $100k in Worldcom, which was supposed to be the backbone of the new economy. Guess what--it wasn't and I still get a tax deduction for that stupidity (just like Trump, except that I don't claim that losing money as a tax avoidance strategy makes me a genius). I held it all the way down to zero instead of cutting my losses when I should have. 
Luckily, the money was a big bonus (my only one ever) and a bit of inheritance, so it didn't put anything else at risk. Also, my wife picked Worldcom (although I picked the ridiculously large amount) so we got to feel sick and stupid together (and we sure did feel that way, since that was most of our money).
AND we learned our lesson to never put all our eggs in one basket like that. Saving 20% of our income and putting it in mutual funds has treated us very well in the two decades since then. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:29:43
That was the strategy that lost me $100k in Worldcom when I should have cut my losses... 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:47:27
Worldcom was supposed to be building the hardware that made the internet possible, so I thought it would be a safer bet than the dot-com stocks everyone was buying at the time. I thought everyone would need the internet no matter which web sites ended up being the winners. 
I think there is a parallel there in the belief that they are both the "technology everyone will need," but even more in that I bought something I didn't understand and bought way too much of it. But also that I learned from my mistake and came out all right once I started doing the dumb, boring, get rich slow thing that was so old news in the business.com era.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:01:20
That's brutal. Since my dotcom days the other thing I've done is that all of my investments are inside my Roth and my 401k, so I haven't had to deal with tax consequences. I max these out, but beyond that I'm paying for private school and saving for college so I'm not doing extra investing.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:26:59
Not sure what you are telling me here. I'm not claiming that Worldcom and Bitcoin are identical or even that Bitcoin is a bubble--just that I believed the hype about how the particular thing I invested in was indispensable to the future of tech without fully understanding it.

Well, the vast majority of humans lived in poverty for millenia so I'm not exactly basing my economic theories on the wisdom of the ages. And we stayed in poverty until we were able to specialize our efforts, which required economic transactions based not just on how two people felt about their exchange when they met face-to-face, but what kind of reasonable expectations they had about what the item they got in the exchange would enable them to purchase from some third party. 
I'm glad (really) that bitcoin is enabling you to have more human contact, but rest assured that no one on the other end of a transaction cares "how much work and effort [you] personally have to put in to acquire the Satoshi that [you] spent." And neither do you--when you buy bitcoin, you don't care whether the guy you're buying it from spent $3 on it years ago with pocket change or $15k on it by mortgaging a house he'd spent his life paying for. You care what YOU will be able to do with it. This is still communicating like humans--just like humans who are aware that they live in an interconnected world of almost 8 billion people and not a tribe of 100 where the long-term effects of every barter can be followed and judged.

This doesn't make any sense. 
First of all because it implies that the term HODLer is useless because we won't ever know if someone was a HODLer until they die without ever having spent their bitcoin.
But primarily it makes no sense because there is no point in owning ANYTHING if you aren't either getting utility from possessing it or expecting to sell it for a profit, and you have just ruled out the second option so I hope you have a nice fluffy pillow stuffed with bitcoin so you're getting some utility out of it.

An investment you NEVER sell is a worthless investment.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:30:01
The flaw in this thinking is that 'the price' is really shorthand for what you can buy with it. If you want to measure the value of bitcoin in cheeseburgers or acres of land or whatever instead of dollars so that you never have to have to touch fiat again, then go ahead and do so. But because the relationship between these things and dollars is so stable, you aren't really doing anything different. You still have to use bitcoin to buy things, and you need a measure of how much buying power you have. And when the price of bitcoins in dollars goes down by 20%, then your buying power has gone down by 20%. 
Unless you never plan to spend your bitcoins at all, in which case you are taking away exactly zero power from central banksters as you are completely economically irrelevant. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:32:02
What does it mean to say something has an "agreed upon increase in price?" You can claim the price is whatever you want, but you still need someone to actually buy it in order for that "price" to have meaning. Did you do the math to see what percent of the world's wealth would have to be held in this currency after 30 years in order for this model to be sustainable? Or the point at which you have to have many multiples of the world's wealth invested in it?

And, where you put "USD" you could put just about every other commodity on earth, because they all seem coincidentally to be moving relatively in tandem with USD but not with bitcoin.

You know, if you really want to get a broader acceptance for bitcoin, might I suggest that step 1 is not to give the "research it yourself" brushoff to someone who is genuinely asking for more information? You can find (almost literally) every opinion on every topic expressed by someone on the internet and I've seen most of them about bitcoin. I was hoping for someone to be willing to have a back-and-forth rather than just get info from some random website that may very well be run by someone with a vested interest in getting others to believe falsehoods.

I hope you know what a low bar this looks like for someone on the outside. "An investment in bitcoin is better than a bad way to hold your money (cash) from which I've chosen the worst possible example (the cash from a corrupt single-resource economy suffering from hyperinflation.)" 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:28:10
The problem with calling this "data" is that each order of magnitude shift results in the investment having a totally different relationship to the world (and thus there must be a totally different set of reasons and circumstances for it to continue). The early growth could come completely from techies who were in love with the concept; as it grew more it needed early adopters and speculators looking for the next big thing. Further growth is going to require the general public (i.e. people who don't understand it) to have a reason to use it and to trust it. There's no reason at all that your historical data suggests that this is going to be true.
Think of a company like Amazon -- they've had huge growth over the past decade, but in order for their version of your chart to be predictive they'd literally have to take over several multiples of the world's economy. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:07:07
I agree. The definition of inflation with respect to a particular currency is that it will buy fewer goods and services over time (prices "inflate" when purchased using that currency). Deflation is the reverse--you will be able to buy more in the future. There's no way to say that a particular currency *is* deflationary by definition--it all depends on what people will sell you for a particular unit.
The idea that BTC is deflationary because it is (or will be) finite only makes sense if you assume that BTC gets to maintain a finite (or growing) percentage of the world's economy, and that that economy is growing. But that's a HUGE assumption, with no evidence to back it up and no particular reason for it to be true.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:43:11
Of course no one can predict the future. It is understood that when someone is saying what is going to happen in the future that is an opinion and thus neither true or false.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:01:54
Please refer back to the original point of this thread. It's not about "the technology" (i.e. the blockchain) but about a specific version of it that people are considering investing in (i.e. bitcoin).  
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:44:19
You are proving the exact point I am making: these technologies are *not* in the same ballpark as the internet (and I like how you slipped bitcoin into the "internet" category once again, and not into the PDA category, when the whole question is which category it falls into).
You have to make the argument about why bitcoin doesn't end up in the "works pretty well" or "outdated by yet again more technological advancement" category. The original post had no more content than "bitcoin and the internet were both dismissed as a novelty once" as though that means they will both share the same fate, and we're pointing out that other technologies in that category had a very different fate. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:09:43
Again, though, the point is that so many "world-changing" technologies have simply been forgotten, so forcing people to remember them so you can shoot them down one by one misses the point. I'm in tech enough to have seen many people who were convinced that what they were working on was the next big thing, but they never even got to the point that anyone else here ever heard of them. I'm sure many here have had the same experience.
And by the way, "shelf life" isn't a way I judge currency. My wealth spends a short enough portion of its life in currency form (like when I need it at some point in the next year or two) that all I care about is convenience, not what would happen if I spontaneously decided to let it sit for 10 years. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:51:51
Not exactly "as big a success as the internet," but in any event the point is that even if the underlying technology the original incarnation is not how it eventually ended up. If you bet big on whatever company made your favorite GPS handheld, there's a good chance you lost your money--you get no points because iPhones ended up incorporating them. Similarly even if blockchain changes the world, that is not a guarantee about bitcoin or its price.

Counterpoint: there were LOTS of 90s technologies that people couldn't imagine becoming dominant. And then they... didn't become dominant. We just don't remember them because they faded away. Failure to take this into account is called survivorship bias, and it's one of the basic logical fallacies.

I remember lots of people using this kinda tough-guy language when people were selling during the dot-com era.

@_date: 2018-11-26 17:33:55


Huh? Do you have any evidence for this at all? Because from where I sit people are determining how to charge in bitcoin by looking at its price in USD, which means things are getting more expensive every day as measured in bitcoin.

Except that rich people *aren't* sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy "cheap" bitcoin. They are avoiding it entirely. There are lots of ways to make money slowly and reliably, and currency speculation isn't one of them.

That was NOT his premise. Invention for the sake of invention is a great thing, but I'm not going to invest in an invention unless I know what problem it solves. Even then, I'm not going to invest unless I believe there's money to be made in solving that problem. Even then I'm not going to invest unless I believe that the particular variant I'm investing in has some sustained competitive advantage over its competitors.

Outliers occur naturally due to random chance, so if you look at enough relatively small subsets you will find "trends." Just start looking at:

How do you figure?
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:16:05
1. Your use of the word "combined" makes it easy to blur the relative importance of the two factors. To my mind, by far the major factor is speculation. The number of people who are using bitcoin because it's actually more useful than the alternative is vanishingly small (though I'd actually be interested to hear how you define "defected from the banks.")  Regarding me "pay(ing) a higher price later to acquire btc," that's making the same unsupported assumption as I originally objected to, but again, when (if) I need to use bitcoin to make a particular transaction it is completely irrelevant to me what the exchange rate is at that time.
2. "If fiat currencies continue to be devalued, then late comers will pay a higher price." This is the straw man of assuming the alternative to keeping your wealth in bitcoin or fiat, and I do neither. The value of a dollar could drop by half in the next 10 years, and it wouldn't affect me much as long as the companies in which I am invested could sell their products for twice as much (which is what we mean when we say the currency is devalued) and thus would have twice as much profit.
3. I'm not making a claim about the utility of the benefits of crypto; in fact it wouldn't surprise me if a lot more people are using it in a decade. But I think the semantic issue is crucial because I am worried that it is enabling self-deception. So many people are hung up on the 21 million ceiling without thinking through the implications of the fact that 21 million is only the hard limit for one specific cryptocurrency, and nothing prevents there from being an infinite number of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:46
That's not all you have to think about--the tech will still be as useful if bitcoin is trading at $2000 as if it's trading at $200000. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:27:49
Isn't there a better way to say "For a long time I've guessed $3500"? Like "A long time ago I sold all my bitcoin and I will be buying again at $3500"?
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:51:46
You can't do this analysis without factoring in two things:
1. The likelihood of each option. If there is a 98% chance it's going to be worth $2000 and a 2% chance it's going to be worth $38000, then the expected value of your investment is $2720, which no investor who makes many investments over the course of their life would take. Without these percentages, you could use your logic to justify absolutely *every* potential investment. Why not buy penny stocks, since the downside is little and the upside is essentially limitless?
2. The opportunity cost which, despite your post title, you don't factor in. The risk is not just that you lose some money but that you fail to invest in other opportunities which more reliably increase in value. You can't simply use logic on bitcoin in isolation; you have to compare it against other opportunities.
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:48:08
This seems like another example of "Let's assume that bitcoin will take over the world. Given that assumption, doesn't the future look bright?"
What if bitcoin follows the mainstreaming process of myspace, or Betamax, or telemodems?
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:25:08
The answer to "why not" is "Because you could make more money elsewhere." If you don't believe that to be true, then stay in. But don't ignore opportunity costs.

Isn't that the key with every question ever?
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:08:07
There are several problems with the Prisoner's Dilemma analysis of bitcoin. A couple simple ones:
1. Like so many analyses, it has an implicit or explicit assumption that demand will keep increasing so that the limited supply means price will appreciate. I've seen no evidence that demand is being driven by anything other than the belief that demand will keep increasing.
2. The whole concept that those of us who are "no-coiners" will be "forced to purchase Bitcoin when much more of the 21 Million Chairs have been filled" is loaded language that misses the whole concept of what currency is used for. If for some reason bitcoin becomes so widely used that I am forced to use it for some transaction (like buying a house), then it doesn't matter to me whether my house costs 2000 bitcoins or one bitcoin because I will only have wealth in bitcoin for long enough to make the transaction.
3. The whole "the supply is limited!" cry seems false, in my opinion. Or at least, it's only true if you accept that there will only ever be one cryptocurrency and it's bitcoin. If crypto really becomes useful, I have no reason to believe that there won't be multiple coins that are adopted as demand rises, making the supply of crypto as a whole essentially unlimited.

A loss is a loss. It doesn't matter what your goal is.
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:05:16
Here's the thing, though: sometimes it's right. The main question is: is it reasonable to expect that the same forces that caused the past performance will be sufficient to drive future performance?
For example, I think the past performance of Tom Brady (or insert your superstar athlete here) is a pretty good predictor of his near-term future performance ability, because the natural gifts and training regimen and study of the game are what drove past performance are still there and will be sufficient.
When you are predicting performance \*trends\* on the other hand, you have to be a lot more careful. I believe the forces that would be necessary for bitcoin to get from $3.5k to $100k would be totally different from those which brought it from $2 to $3.5k (speculation and idealism), which are in turn different from those that brought it from 10 cents to $2 (fascination with the new technology). I've seen no evidence of such forces. Further, I don't have any reason to believe that if the basic underlying tech does get adopted on a larger scale that new forces (i.e. competition from altcoins) will arise to keep the value down.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:19:00
If you think your only choices for "investment" are gold and bitcoin, we don't have enough in common for me to care which of those options you choose.

"Learn math?" Seriously? I think the mathematical term you are looking for is "mutually independent," not "mutually exclusive." Nothing in this discussion is mutually exclusive.
Anytime we apply a mathematical model to the actual world, we have to make some assumptions about things like the degree of independence of events, and the fact that I made different assumptions than you doesn't have anything to do with whether one of us knows math or not. And the degree of independence can be measured on a continuum; I would claim that a whole lot of events would have to happen to move bitcoin from where it is now to $1M that are independent of the events that brought it from its starting price to its current price.

Bitcoin does not have a "deflationary nature". 
Simply having a limited supply of something does not make it inherently deflationary--it also requires that demand increase, which you are assuming without providing any evidence for.
I'm also very curious as to how you can claim that people will know exactly the rate of deflation; can you tell me what the rate of deflation will be over the next year because I could really use that information!

So, of the 200 countries in the world, you've looked back over 200+ years to come up with a list of 8 countries that had really bad hyperinflation over a period of a year. Those are pretty good odds! I feel better about using fiat now--thanks!
As for normal inflation, this bothers me not a bit. I have less than 5% of my net worth in any form of currency, and that amount is only for purchases I need to make in the next year or so. I'm totally fine with losing the difference between a high-yield savings account and US inflation on that money.

jeremysand, that's only meaningful if you could look into 2018 to figure out what the "top" tech companies were, and then invest in them in the 90s.

That's not how conditional probability works. If someone just flipped 20 heads in a row, I can't say "Flipping another 10 heads in a row sounds a lot less crazy than flipping that first 20 heads" as though I've somehow suggested we're about to see 10 heads. The flaw is that if you look at enough flippers, you will find that guy who rolled the 20, but you've got to include the number of people you looked at in the equation.

If by "bankster" you mean someone associated with the financial industry, then no. I'm an engineer. But I do rely on the banking system for making my short-to-medium-term financial life easier. I don't want to have to be an expert in the tech; I want to pay someone else to do that so I can focus on being an expert in my field (and my other actual interests).
I only hold what I need for the next few years in cash (which is a lot right now since I have kids heading toward college...) So I don't much care about inflation--I just don't want volatility, and bitcoin is of no help there.
The portion of my wealth that is intended for the long term is not in currency of any sort, so the relative advantage (if any) of bitcoin over dollars doesn't matter there either.

This is an...odd comment. If 10 people a day stopped using Google, then in 10 years we would get rid of Google. But why would anyone do that? I use fiat because it's really useful to me. I get my paycheck direct-deposited to my bank by an employer that only pays that way. I pay my mortgage directly that way. I pay contractors that way. I rely on the bank to maintain the security of my money, and I'm not worried that I'm one lost password away from not having that money. I don't mind paying my bank for the service they provide. I'm like the vast majority of people who aren't in this for the philosophy, but are using banks because they make life a lot simpler and easier. And I'll continue using them until something better comes along.

What does this even mean? People "use fiat" to buy stuff because that is what people who sell stuff want to be paid in. Using it is different from investing in it.

Gold has always been a terrible "investment" over any reasonable period of time. My net worth thanks me for never having bought any.

I think this is called "unrealized losses." Or, maybe more to the point, "sunk costs fallacy" This thinking kept me in Worldcom for way too long--a lesson I will never need to learn again.

I don't know if it peaked or not; I'm not trying to guess. All I'm saying is that history is littered with "investments" that never regained their earlier levels of demand; I've made some of those investments myself. It's not useful to say "shorting will stop when demand dictates it to" without making a case for why that might happen.

Storing your wealth in any form of currency is a bad idea.

There's a limited supply of East German Marks as well.

Wait -- are you saying people who invest in bitcoin are working for the *Nazis*? That seems a bit harsh.

Are you looking for a different answer from "because every merchant I want to buy something from takes cash"?
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:36:46
You mean *if* catalysts/adoption/demand dictates it to.

The problem is that sometimes others are selling because they have information that what they own is going to go down in value (or they realize they have no idea why they own it) instead of just that they are sheep. Warren Buffet's advice is NOT simply to buy when others are selling; it's to have a deep understanding of what the fundamental earnings-generation potential of a share is and to buy when others are underestimating this. If he just bought a company every time others were selling it, he'd have bought a lot of companies that subsequently went bankrupt.

People who are trying to convince themselves of bitcoin's greatness need to stop using the straw man of holding wealth in fiat. The fact that one currency *might* hold its value slightly better than another doesn't mean that either one is a good way to hold any significant amount of wealth. The portion of my net worth I have in cash right now is only that which I'm going to need for big purchases in the next few years, and the reason I have it in cash is because I need stability, not growth. Dollars in high-yield savings accounts have a good track record of doing that; bitcoin does not.

Warren Buffett did *NOT* say that others being fearful is sufficient reason to be greedy, which is how too many posters on this sub keep using this quote. I've been greedy when others are fearful in the past, and guess what? I lost a bunch of money because it turned out that others were fearful because they were more well-informed. 
Warren Buffett knows when to be greedy because he does extensive research on the underlying value of the companies he targets. There are far more times when others are fearful but he doesn't do a thing because he can't estimate the underlying value or thinks they are right to be fearful.

Bitcoin does *not* have a deflationary nature, and I don't know why so many people keep saying this.  The fact that there is only a limited quantity of something doesn't mean it is therefore inherently deflationary; there still has to be an increasing demand for that thing. I broke my patio foundation into 10 pieces of concrete; there will never be more pieces of concrete from this source again. This doesn't mean my concretecoin has a deflationary nature.
And the only thing that will create a demand for bitcoin over the long term is if people actually get utility from it, which means (for example) using it to buy food products.

I certainly thought so at the time...

If government fiat don't worth shit in 2021, there won't be anything to buy with bitcoin either as the world economic system will have collapsed. No farming, no electricity, no transportation. No one is going to be interested in your solar-powered bitcoin that can't be verified in the absence of an internet, so you will need to "buy" things the way they do in Mad Max.

I don't think you understand what the word "slavery" means.

It's kind of meaningless to say something is inherently deflationary if you have to add on a parenthetical "assuming increasing demand." *Everything* is inherently deflationary if I'm allowed to assume sufficient increasing demand.

I don't disagree with your original statement, but I'm having trouble following your logic. I've seen this "21 million coins" thing posted time after time after time on this sub as though it is some absolute barrier to inflation or that it will cause the value of bitcoin to go to the moon because those 21 million bitcoins will take over the economy, but they completely leave out the "desirable" part (as did the OP). 
What I'm having trouble with is having any reason to believe that this one particular currency will grow to enormous proportions, as opposed to (for example) a continuously increasing number of digital currencies being spawned. Maybe I will be using bitcoin for transactions some day, but I certainly won't be storing any wealth in them (nor in any currency) in the hope that the one I chose is going to gobble up the economy.
