Yes, you are right, I want to say "hardware PRNG", I imagine there is some substitute.
Now I have only to clarify connection between only software and only hardware number generator. I argue from what you say, also if you haven't secure hardware you can still generate good pseudorandom numbers. I will get a first view on this from the links above in the meanwhile...

we want to also come in here to bitcoin because your committee of home land security and government affairs has been doing digging on this topic of virtual currency. you held a number of investigations and hearings. so far, what have you found? 
next to nothing about bitcoins and virtual currencies, 6, 12 months ago. turns out the federal agency, treasury department, irs, justice department, homeland security, the consume proer tekz bureau, they're on top of it. i was pleasantly surprised to see that they are xun indicating with each one, collaborating with one another. one of the themes that merged was basically this, when the internet was young people said, well, who cares about that? some people say, potential. some say it has downside potential with drug transactions and trafficking of money laundering. all kinds of downsides but i think the early message on the internet was let's not kill the baby in the cradle. and i think there's some upside here for bitcoin, virtual currency. it's not all together clear. we know there's bad stuff that can happen through the use of virtual currencies like bitcoin but also good things can happen to enhance transactions between sellers and buyers, can help internet and national trade, lower the cost of transactions. so i think the theme of the merchants that i'm hearing is less -- keep on eye on the bad stuff, try to tach it down, find the lemg lags we need to tamp it down. that's what we're doing.

Mmmm but doing this it let the US to take advantage because they have more time to develop new things! Anyway you are right, here we have a ton of laws and bureaucracy, it's near impossible to do all when you want to innovate.

From what I remember Gavin after doing research for 1 year come out with a 20 MB block increase solution, but there was an error in calculation and actually he want to say 8 MB, the other genius you are talking about actually do the same but with no limit to block... now we got the last one Roger Ver... stick with ethereum like other little bitches with no actual investigation, we will talk here again in around 1 year.
