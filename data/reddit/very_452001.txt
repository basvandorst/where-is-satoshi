Anyone know?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:32:02
I'm confused, I thought in order to run LN you need to have segwit running already? Or can you bypass segwit straight to LN? 
@_date: 2016-04-06 17:12:38
Thanks for the advice, as a total newbie to this I have more questions?
Im a Windows PC and Android mobile user.
Which wallet is the most secure? 
Can someone hack your wallet or a virus stealing all the bitcoins?
Bitcoins are like a peer to peer network right? So can this bitcoin network be closed down like p2p networks napster and kazaa in the past?
If bitcoins are not affected by inflation then how come the value of it goes up and down? Will I be making an investment risk If I buy bitcoins now? What is value outcome value of bitcoins in the future?
Can Law enforcement seize/limit a bitcoin wallet or online bitcoin account like a bank account?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:29:01
So whats delaying them accepting segwit?
@_date: 2016-04-19 22:37:51
Sorry for not understanding, you mean website, which one?
You have a link for circle?
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:18:23
Ok to summarise my understanding LN payments is possible without segwit first however the fee is more expensive than segwit LN?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:30:15
Since august just 10%, when do you think over 90% adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:25:49
Ok who you bank with?
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:05:42
Hi what are the support lines and resistance lines?
If support lines are broken how low can it go approx?
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:15:22
Who wants to see it crash?
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:46:29
What about in UK?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:37:18
Ok when do you think we will get the results from testnet to show us whether its stable or not?
I thought a transaction malleability fix such as segwit is needed first before LN is put on top correct?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:30:49
Hello what are the support lines and what will it take for bitcoin to break resistance lines?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:22:16
When are they gonna back it up?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:26:34
What is that?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:48:30
When is NYSE entering bitcoin? Jan 1st 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:41:58
When is NYSE entering bitcoin and is it guaranteed?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:59:21
You serious?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:12
Shall I expect the usual bitcoin price dip this weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:57:10
Can we expect a price dip in the next working week so we can buy cheap or will wet get another ATH next week?
Any future FUD that hasnt been established?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:08:31
I opened google authenticator, didn't see a code. Please help.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:21
Whats the lowest it will go? We are approaching the weekend, will it go lower? What about christmas day, will volume dry up on this day and wall street closed on this day right?
Or will there be a dead cat bounce back to $20000?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:12:33
Sorry what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:31:50
I have fiat balance at coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:20:41
I clicked on the link and see 3 charts. Which one is important?
Whats the lowest satoshis per byte fee I can use to send regardless on how long it takes?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:44:29
How do I do that lol?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:37:30
Ok when you think they will do that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:32
Ok what is the next price support line for btc and when will bitcoin cash pump be finished?
How far down will the dip go?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:42:27
Sorry I dont understand. What is the seed?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:49
How do I save the seed?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:43:13
What you guys think bottom out support price will be? 9000? Shall i assume over christmas eve and christmas day volumes will be low resulting in lower prices? Futures markets closed on christmas right? 
If this dipping continues into new year 2018 then bitcoin will have a bad start 2018 caused by news media which will result in a deeper lower price back to 5000? The only way i can see bitcoin breaking new all time highs is lightning network. Please correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:45:55
Yeah how do I do this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:45:43
Ok I am looking at the mempool. I see alot of colours. What do I look out for on mempool?
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:23:22
I dont see it available on my account. Whats going on?
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:36:05
So I will lose all my funds in my account or just the dodgy deposits?
Cant I show receipts to Fidor of the trades I did on Localbitcoins to show that Im the victim?
Will having IDs, selfies etc. help get the seller get his bitcoin back from a dodgy buyer?
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:31:36
I assume from that 2020 event prices are guaranteed to go up?
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:29:25
When are those 2 events happening?
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:30:55
When is this teechan happenning?
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:48:58
Is Gemini useless for people in UK then?
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:26:04
That is why bitcoin price is going down now because of nervous investors waiting for tuesdays announcement?
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:33:59
Theres 2 ETF events on those 2 dates?
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:31:31
What day next week we will get the news from People Bank of China?
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:30:42
Ok which is the best update for bitcoin in your opinion? Segwit or Teechan?
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:30:40


People Bank of China announces a new regulation next week? What day next week?
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:54:17
Ok will keep you guys updated, many thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:54:33
Ok what about?:
- OPENDIME
- Ledger HW.1
- Ledger Unplugged
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:31:02
Ok so from this analysis if ETF is disaproved or if SegWit does not activate before the end of 2017 then that means bitcoin prices will come crashing down?
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:25:06
I would if I knew chinese.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:18:15
Getting 3 different answers Tuesday, Friday and Wednesday and the bubble burst today Thursday. 
Really can this bitcoin reddit forum be taken seriously? As the viewers here are getting contradictory answers. If someone said the correct answer which is wednesday/thursday then we could have saved the investors from losing millions from the bubble burst. Please next time state the correct answer info. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:07:50
I did read earlier days ago in my threads someone mentioned people bank of china (pboc) but couldn't give an exact date?
Does the chinese government keep future public announcement dates to themselves so the public don't know these date beforehand and hence being surprised when hearing these announcements? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:43:49
This NSA operation Orchestra. Is it a secret government operation and how will it affect bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:21:56
I mean what time in UK GMT time
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:35:57
Do you think there might be some market manipulation by the chinese before the ETF date causing price to crash so chinese can buy them cheaply then sell them at a profit after the ETF approval?
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:07:09
I just see a list, which one is it and how do I know if it is approved?
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:49:47
Im surprised no one mentioned that chinese announcement event that burst the bitcoin price bubble today. If someone would have said this last week we could have saved investors millions from this burst. Thats if the investors came on reddit to read this thread/posts.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:37:23
Yeah I agree Bitcoin must not stray away from decentralisation into centralisation.
So any decentralised, open-source or anything that is not patent protected and can be copyrighted can be copied and edited like we are seeing with BU unless a company/government authority takes control to enforce these copyright laws right?
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:39:33
Well the mainstream media might use that ISIS excuse to destroy bitcoin saying that bitcoin is the currency of ISIS. Then how we us bitcoin community respond to that?
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:20:49
Sorry I meant the decision will be made by end of this summer Aug/Sep in regards to forks.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:46:03
So next week is when we will see the true price after the dust has settled? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:47:33
Bitcoin plus is a new coin really?
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:50:32
So any altcoin with low market caps can at any given moment can go to the moon randomly at 2000% jump? Surely there must be more behind it.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:54:39
Are they making an announcement tomorrow tuesday?
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:48:14
I posted after the pump which is now called the dump.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:34:23
I thought the EU economy is collapsing.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:09:32
On the bitcoin forum site
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:07:54
So everyone on this website and elsewhere that uses crypto will need to register with the EU government if that law passes?
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:27:04
So this EU law will affect centralised exchanged then as customers will flock to decentralised exchanges. Apart from Bitsquare are there any other decentralised exchanges?
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:33:38
Ok, which ones deal with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:36:38
Adoption of what?
I thought updates like Segwit or Hard Fork is beneficial to the bitcoin network so why you say temporary negative impact?
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:06:21
There wont be no announcement on Saturday or Sunday right?
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:06:57
I heard the BU hard fork will happen at the end of summer this year or when will it happen?
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:46:36
Buyers who buying now are falling into a trap?
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:52:00
Surely there must be information leaks that a early insider or insiders have taken in otherwise you telling me that all these buyers are taking a risk by buying high before the dip?
Bitcoin is volatile and everyone has to believe that. Even those funny chinese announcements can make it volatile as well. Thats how volatile it is.
Gold and Silver isnt volatile as its always stable.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:46:01
Ok if I do convert it to USD or EUR then will I lose money by a Kraken conversion fee or Kraken's exchange rates?
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:30:08
Ok many thanks
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:20:09
So they will keep you in prison until you reveal the keys?
So bitcoins becomes a bail me out of prison coins lol? A real world usage I see.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:47:04
What do you mean by the team is doing it wrong?
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:41:26
Gold is more established and been around for 1000's of years. Can you see bitcoin being established for 1000's of years when technology moves at a rapid pace that can make bitcoin tech outdated right?
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:12:19
Ok you saying there's artificial Gold instead of natural gold mined from the ground. Surely nothing artificial can beat natural. For example GMO corn is not better than natural organic corn.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:05:58
Ok hopefully they will as I don't want to wait forever to make a trade. Cheers,
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:43:13
Yeah bitcoin is best for convenience but hackers can take bitcoins from a person unless hardware or paper wallet. Surely this will dent the confidence of buyers. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:46:59
Like i said earlier hackers can steal bitcoins. What if a hacker creates a malware or virus that can detect bitcoin wallets on phones/computers and steal them because the person doesn't have the latest security updates installed for their operating system.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:12:28
Ok so how do I sort out this problem now?
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:14:42
My stomach sank as I felt I lost my bitcoins when i seen the 0btc balance. What do you mean its buggy? Its a problem on the ledger company side that requires an patch?
Also I tried doing the splitting with the steps mentioned above and it wont allow me to send to that split receive address. What to do?
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:17:56
im confused to when people are able to dump bcc on echanges then how does that affect btc price? Wont it just affect bcc price?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:36:36
They could buy out the exchanges?
Or got the exchanges on tabs bypassing KYC laws cause they are the elite?
Previous high and crashes are genuine as bitcoin is volatile however if we keep seeing continuous price mooning then there is something suspicious there especially when Goldmen Sachs one of bitcoin biggest enemies is telling us to buy bitcoin. Sounds dodgy right?
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:13:07
Ok you mean the whales are waiting for lower bcc prices or lower btc prices before moving a majority of their holdings?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:08:59
Ok so its just gonna affect BitPay users? 
Do you think it will cause the price to dip?
btc1 is not the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:23:45
Looking at the charts now it's going up slowly instead of going down, why you think that is the case?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:11:18
Couldn't they buy out all the exchanges? Exchanges just care about money.
Decentralised exchanges is 1 way of tackling this threat. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:14:38
How will the police seize bitcoin? Will they torture the holder for the private keys lol?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:21:40
Ok heard about Fidor. 
They are a German bank right in EU.
Im from UK and UK has voted for brexit that is we are leaving the EU. What does this mean for UK customers with Fidor? Is Fidor covered by the UK £75000 deposit guarantee?
Also heard EU economy is hostile at the moment with Italy banks being on the verge of collapse. If EU economy collapses and Fidor is in EU does that mean I lose all my money in Fidor if the collapse happens?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:35:40
Thanks for the helpful info. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:56:25
Hi did the following steps but get an error message and all transactions history on main btc chain has disappeared and sometimes intermittently it shows 0btc balance then the correct balance. Please advise what is going on?
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:23:40
Ok understood many thanks
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:59:01
Do you think with I will miss the btc Dip now?
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:18:05
Ok why they both racing to that bottom you think
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:13:55
Looks like its gonna take time to dip to the bottom from the way it looks now. Meanwhile during this time bitcoin will keep going up I assume?
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:40:51
Just bitsquare, nothing else? 
Bitsquare cheap to buy? How payment is made in bitsquare?
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:54:00
Ok segwit 2x is due for november yeah?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:17:50
You mean meeting up with local bitcoiners and doing a cash transaction? Yet sellers still have to keep the cash safe somewhere in a bank for example. When banks see these cash deposits and their computers detect this then what can the customer do?
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:25:20
Ok if bitcoin cash looks good after proper trading then will btc go down or up? and
If bitcoin cash looks bad after proper trading then will btc go down or up?
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:42:06
Cant believe so much hassle of buying bitcoins. To buy bitcoins you have to take a selfie with a piece of paper written by yourself saying this and that looking like a right fool. Its Embarrassing. It puts people off buying them.
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:59:26
Sorry Im not understanding.
How payment is made in Indacoin and Bitsquare?
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:58:28
The fiat withdrawal fee is £60, yeah I ask to see if their conversion/exchange fees work out to be cheaper.
@_date: 2016-12-10 00:49:54
Yeah I know I should have got them then. Now price has doubled yikes.
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:43:40
Not much at the moment. Dont have that much bitcoins to start off with.
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:49:07
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:57:24
Where about in Birmingham is this place?
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:47:29
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:49:17
Is it confirmed though? Im concerned because there was a NYA agreement on contract I remember. Or what is the probability of being a hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:48:42
Hi for future reference how do I analyse like yourself and find out what are resistance levels, support lines etc?
7200 is broken correct?
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:59:43
Which exchanges are reliable not fake?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:21:46
looks like its dipping going back to earth now, whys that?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:31:22
Fat lady sang yet?
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:01:40
it looks dead now, why you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:35:22
There has been a tether hack recently, what does that mean for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:11:39
What you think price will correct to?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:48:22
Ok whats about the current analysis
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:55:33
When will there be new ATH's?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:25:21
When bitcoin cash hard fork happening? What price and when you guys think bitcoin will stabilise at from the current dipping?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:11:10
You mean Tether Alt coin. What about it? Not understanding.
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:35:53
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:37:57
Yeah why isn't coinbase pro popular not in the top 5 and didn't bitfinex got hacked before which affected their rankings?
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:51:53
So hard fork will happen and people will believe BU hard fork will fail like you said. But regardless of this the price will still crash leading to the hard fork date or on the hard fork date
So the question is why don't investors buy bitcoins for cheap on the day or leading to hard fork when the priced has crashed instead of buying it now making the price increasing now.
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:02:37
Many thanks for the advice. So it's narrowed down between Trezor and Ledger Nano S. Difficult choice.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:03:17
You believe there will be a bull run or bull market starting from tomorrow? If not why buy?
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:54:44
What is 1 BIP39 and 44 dont remember phrase?
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:15:10
What about the hodler who has a portfolio of lets say for example 25 different cryptos/altcoins spread between dozens of centralized exchanges.
How does this person withdraw all of the 25 cryptos balances for the sake of proof of keys? Is there a easier convenient way to do this inconvinient task? 
Also does every crypto has its own wallet to accomplish the above task? If so the person has to download 25 different wallets which is another inconvinience and hassle. Is there a user friendly way?
Finally what about cryptos/altcoins that due for a coin swap to the new chain or version decided by the development team? On centralised exchanges you should get a notification of this in advance by email so the person can make preparations to prevent hodling useless worthless obsolete coins. If the person downloads 25 different wallets then will he/she be notified of possible coin swaps? Is there a user friendly way of doing this for sake of proof of keys?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:44:55
We all know that means a easy $million each for bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:29:33
Ok you saying governments want to get rid of cash worldwide and go all digital so they can track and trace digital.
Bitcoin fits this description so does that mean governments like bitcoin or will central banks around the world create their own cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:53:53
This weekend you reckon or a different date?
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:36:05
Ok what about Jamie Dimon buying tons of bitcoin causing a price pump from the bottomed out dip, will a dump follow this?
Who are the PRC? 
What about chinese exchanges closing at the end of september, will this cause the price to dip again or price has been already reflected for this?
Ok so the end of october we will know whether chinese miners will be banned or not from the PRC 19th congress? Ok from this if chinese miners get banned then segwit 2x wont happen or vice versa?
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:00:53
Go uphill if chinese FUD is over of course.
So its a big risk buying now short term don't you think if chinese announce mining ban. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:36:09
Yeah when bitcoin gold coming out?
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:35:50
Ok its already october, 2 more weeks yeah?
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:11:07
Located in UK, not just bitcoin, altcoins too.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:28:50
Not pointless just wanna know which exchanges to select?
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:40:22
Smooth Sailing to $5000 from now on?
Shall I assume chinese banning miners FUD is gone?
When is segwit 2x hard fork happening? When will the FUD start for this?
Its already october what can we expect from now?
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:14:22
Any coinbase employees here that can answer?
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:11:16
I remember the ETF BY Winklevoss twins got rejected in early 2017. Is this basically the same thing?
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:16:21
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:18:53
Ok how do I re-import the seed?
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:48:04
Ok many thanks for your responses, do keep us updated on this issue.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:04:08
Is this ongoing Consensus 2017 classed as a FUD or bullish for bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:38:05
lol I already know all that but what's really causing it to go up?
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:40:06
Attack by hackers yeah?
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:21:25
Hi are you an employee of Ledger? If so is this 10min delay pin a common problem or do I have a faulty ledger nano s?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:17:19
Ok cool thats good to now thanks
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:49:07
Need help with the included accessories in the box such as neck straps, key rings etc. How the hell do you attach them accessories to the ledger itself?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:20:18
Thanks for the detailed response. Ok how do soft fork chain splits merge back together in the future?
Also from your example if I send coins from new chain to old chain it will be accepted because 0.7mb fits under 1mb but wont work vice versa?
Which affects investors confidence more, is it hard forks or soft forks chain splits, which is more risky?
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:17:46
Litecoin was already undervalued at $4 before reaching $50.
You cant say bitcoin is undervalued now correct?
Yeah $28500 by mid august then dip back down again to $2000 for november hard fork drama lol
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:22:48
Ok I tried the 1min delay and after 1min the screensaver came on and ask for pin once i press button. So 1min delay option works but not 10mins delay option.
Please advise.

If it seems to happens with some configurations then the problem must be already known by ledger correct?
What do you mean by some configurations? Meaning not at default settings?
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:27:25
That is good for hodl investors who like to go long term however not good idea for short term investors or traders who like to short bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:16:28
More details please
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:47:35
Chosen 10mins delay.
Ok I will close the apps ledger uses and just connect it to pc by usb and see if I have the same problem. I keep u guys updated.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:34:57
I already bought it brand new off ebay, it came brand new shrink wrapped. Please advise.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:31:36
That site similar to coinmarketcap. Dont see any differences.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:25:50
The article will be updated tomorrow?
Something magical might happen soon?
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:13:10
Is there any real time live info that we can track on to see whether there will be a split or no split?
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:23:04
Ok did all that updating to latest v1.3 and installed individual wallets software and so far no problems. So I assume my ledger nano s is legit then
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:53:19
Ok so still 4 weeks away to see $3000 i guess. What you think?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:17:06
Approved or Rejected lol?
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:37:40
Whats the latest on this?
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:45:25
I thought Donald trump was for bitcoin not against it.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:14:28
Yeah my latest status is I still have the same problem.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:51:56
Yeah i know fiat currency is shit but whats the real reason for btc price pump?
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:46:20
Ok, April?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:23:46
Isnt there already FUD now that caused the current price dip?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:09:19
What caused the dip? BCC FUD?
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:15:34
Ok Can chain splits from soft forks create an altcoin? For example if miners don't agree with UASF BIP148 then that becomes an altcoin?
What affects bitcoin price more, is it chain splits or hard forks?
Does BCC have built in replay attacks protection?
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:35:18
wow thats a long time.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:18:25
Isnt there one called bitsquare?
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:18:06
Isnt there a decentralised exchange already called bitsquare? So all the above features combined vs bigger block sizes? If all features you mentioned is better than bigger block sizes then why bitcoin cash and segwit2x popping up any why a need for these forks?
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:11:25
What do you mean by that? Buy the speculative rumours and sell when when news/facts happen like do you mean sell when segwit is actually activated?
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:53:19
Ok thanks, to summarise my understanding so far:
- Theres 2 stages of segwit2x, 1st stage is exactly like bip148 except 2nd stage three months later is a hard fork. Ok where can I see live % info of segwi2x and what % it needs to get consensus?
- If segwit2x does not activate before august 1st then bip148 wins and gets activated? BIP148 guarantees a hard fork as it does not have consensus. Ok where can I see live % info of bip148 and what % it needs to get consensus?
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:20:35
Yeah without exchanges for buyers to buy them on how will it drive up the price? Or if it becomes scarce I can choose whatever price to sell my bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:04:47
What you mean? I thought the segwit2x split will happen in november.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:31:58
SHA-256 is changing?
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:51:41
Ok apart from the above 2 tools is there a another way to watch live selective altcoins all on 1 screen at the same time using live data from coinmarketcap?
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:10:40
When is bitcoin getting segwit? Is it before bitcoin cash?
You telling me bitcoin btc price will keep on mooning regardless of bitcoin cash on august 1st? Right now price of btc looks stabilising not going up or down.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:09:08
Which others are upcoming?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:21:40
Bump anyone?
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:54:15
Ok how do i get notified updated on this?
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:22:36
Yeah i mean a soft fork can also split the bitcoin chain without consensus correct?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:49:08
You say nobody knows whats going to happen yet you say split is not going to happen. How do you know split wont happen?
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:03:10
Only a guaranteed smooth transition to segwit without split will rise the price. Whats the earliest date we will know this?
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:29:21
Ok many thanks, understand a bit more now. Hopefully i can remember this info.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:45:33
Please remind me what date is when miners deploy BIP91?
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:47:42
I know it is volatile but what I want to know is that some people are saying nothing bad will happen on Aug 1st while others saying bad will happen on Aug 1st. So as you can understand i'm confused lol. 
As at this point no one will know what will happen on aug 1st? Or what date within a week will we know something for certain?
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:20:44
Ok you mean bip148 will split the bitcoin chain and becomes the shorter chain. When you say it gets abandoned do you mean it will become an Alt and price of it will plummet and die?
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:35:06
I thought sewit is guaranteed to be activated to avoid a chain split?
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:46:52
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:33:34
Adam clark is the ceo of cryptopia?
Jeb McCaleb owns Ripple and Stellar?
Didnt Mt.gox customers get compensated at the end?
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:25:56
why marketcap doesnt matter?
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:30:58
There should be a website that tracks these swaps as there's 1000's of coins out there and the investor might have a portfolio of hundreds of different coin bags and it is a tedious task to manually check each coin for news. This isn't good for crypto and will put off 1st time long term investors. Emails from exchanges might end up in spam folder as well. Not good at all in this age of technology and easy automation.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:59:40
Does the cost of mining difficulty algorithm be in sync with price? Or is there a lag or delay from real time price? 
I don't understand who mines bitcoin that costs $5000 for mining then sells for $3800 or are all miners hodlers? Or are all miners based in cheap electricity bill locations that can still make a profit?
Can someone please ELI5. Less miners = less difficulty = less mining costs right? If that is the case where bitcoin price continues to fall then will our normal desktop pc's be able to mine bitcoins easily like in the old 2010-11 days?
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:29:38
2-3 weeks till August 1st. Has everything to do with the price till then and beyond.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:17:24
Come on I know everyone is upset for losing money but it's best to get these questions addressed before even more possible money is lost. Im not asking exactly where the price floor is, just asking for a estimate.
Shall I assume it will go back down to $1200-1300?
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:22:42
But Kraken don't have a SEPA for £GBP deposits.
Please advise.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:02:41
When do you guys think all these so called tourists gonna exit bitcoin/alts ��?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:41:31
3 chains? Should be 2 chains correct? Because UASF is a soft fork and soft forks do not split the chain right?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:44:03
Yeah also like to know when the the split happens into chains will I get extra coin for that chain?
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:32:11
So I have to build my own website?
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:24:48
if stop mining then what about the security of the network?
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:26:10
What is sov and moe?
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:42:15
I see a bitcoin bubble, surely it's gonna burst correct? Or name me one bubble that has never been bursted in the market.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:47:20
So is this a repeat similar drama of Roger Bitcoin Unlimited back in March?
So it's best to buy bitcoin in August then when its cheap. So why the current pump of bitcoin prices to high $3000 when investors know of a imminent Bitmain threat soon?
