"No one is above the law."
Fuck that noise. This was the South's cry when people refused to send back their "fugitive" slaves. The law is the single most oppressive tool on the planet.
Encryption has nothing to do with being above the law, it has to do with personal privacy and protection. So, when laws are bullshit (like this piece of trash), it's our duty as free people to disobey them.

The courts don't want you to hold your own values. They want you to have the values of the courts. It doesn't matter if you don't care about blow, a lot of collections of 12 persons can be convinced it's a terrible thing: you should know better so you should go to jail. 
People don't like to leave each other alone. They like to tell people what to do. So that's why we must strive to do our trades (asset and artisan) in Bitcoin.
I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I believe performing one's economy in Bitcoin is bigger than a smart investment. Being allowed to use Bitcoin is essential to protecting free speech. A trusted ledger can have a lot of value in a free market.
It's really cool how you can resist coercive political will with technology. Hopefully more people will soon see the fallacy behind the necessity of hierarchy for equality and justice. They say we should vote with our dollars, but there are those very afraid of us being able to pick our form of currency. To control that much of our economy threatens their control over our economy. But here's the beauty of it: they can't stop us. They can attack us, and they may if Bitcoin is blamed for economic "collapse". But I think we'll be amazed what happens once people realize they can choose to have digital cash and cryptographically confirmable free credit ratings.
My friends, they won't be able to stop us from sharing all the wealth with everyone else for too long. Freedom is knocking on the technological door step.

It wasn't a straw man, it was sarcasm. Paradigm shifts require working outside of the current paradigm. I'm working toward a decentralized revolution, and that isn't really something legislators are willing to offer.
Working within the political system merely legitimizes it. I do not believe the American Empire is legitimate in any sense, so I do not believe it is the proper vehicle for progress. You are free to disagree, but I hope you see that government isn't benevolent in nature simply because it's "democratic".

I'm absolutely with you regarding accounting for inevitabilities and working in reality. I would love some good sources for learning more about game theory. 
I think it must be possible to develop some sort of decentralized, consensus seeking control mechanism for that inevitable body you speak of though. Similar to the way the US Constitution is actually written (not how it's abused today). It's written to be self balancing with the different branches, and at an even larger level with the 10th amendment, but Marbury v Madison and political convenience have often been used together to justify the perpetually centralizing behavior of the Federal Government since Lincoln.
I think a decentralized society would recognize the requirement for cooperative, "common defence" in order to survive, but I haven't figured out how to avoid entangling alliances in that system.
I think the key is strictly limited powers of any central body, but that just means the actual power lies with the units making up that body.
I think an important step is not accepting utilitarian methods for justice, because utilitarian justifications are unfair due to circumstances.
Do you not think military control could be handled by voluntarily organizing units? I'm imagining modern day minutemen.

But it's primarily motivated by economic incentive, it's not our love of trust that has caused us to pour so much money into the mining technology, it's been speculation on profit. The security it has generated is doubtlessly a good for the holders of bitcoin. The blockchain is excellent technology, I just believe we could put the credit reward for a "proof-of-work" to even better uses.
I'm suggesting that the "mining" process be utilized to perform work that is traditionally unperformed due to the tragedy of the commons (e.g. remediation of waste). The people who then choose to value said credit rewards with services give value to the credits as a currency: a unit of account, enabling division of labor in exchanging services.

I will never accept your "realistic" view of the world. The world is what we make it, human nature is what we make it. We are self-aware organisms who can adapt and improve themselves. I will not accept centralization or the power of the collective squashing the individual as an eventuality.
You can look to history to learn from past mistakes, but history does not dictate the future. You can give up on a world with a foundation of mutual respect, but I will not. I will stick to my principles and attempt to bring about technological solutions to the social injustices of today. Working with a broken system is a failed concept from the start.
Freedom of association is a human right and I will not accept that coercive practices are just the way things are done. I truly want to change the world for the better, and I choose to do so in a method that is ideologically consistent. You can take your ruthless pragmatism as far as you want, but I will not accept any means necessary for my goals.
You can give up the good fight. I won't. I am striving for a new paradigm of P2P societies. We can organize an Agorist war of attrition against hierarchy. You can maintain your "the world is lost" mentality, but you're thinking in terms of the way things work today and have in the past. I'm pursuing the way they can and should be done in the future.
Call me childish, but I think you're just pessimistic and cynical. I hope you one day have hope again.

And even I refer to economic "collapse", I mean a rapid transfer of wealth from today's monopoly-capitalists to the actual people performing the labor that we divide up amongst ourselves for the good of ourselves.
I'm not a "fucking ancap", I'm a mutualist who sees the parasitic state apparatus as the cost-socializing, profit-centralizing beast exemplifying all of humanities misconceptions of how to make the world a better place. You can't just write more rules and magically change people's character.

You can hold paper wallets with the sole keys to access to your Bitcoin. Or on a USB stick. Or your personal computer. You can own that. 
Holding it in mtgox is not holding it, and this is true. It seems they're guilty of fractional reserve Bitcoin exchanging. Or just being really, really stupid with their bitcoins. Or liars. It looks like a classic bank run.
Nonetheless, Bitcoin as a payment technology cannot be uninvented. Finance and contracts will change forever. Bitcoin is a bigger idea than just money. And I personally hope it shows people they have the right to choose what they value.

Why do people act surprised that the Chinese government is trying to enact more control over its currency? They want to restrict Bitcoin payment processing companies (which is essentially what the exchanges are, taking advantage of the liquidity in the trading market). When the number of people who want Bitcoin more than yuan was growing, I could see how a Central Bank wouldn't be a fan of such a situation.

You need to read about the credit theory of money and stop kidding yourself that gold has any "intrinsic value". 
It doesn't decay and it's a great conductor. Historically people have liked it because it's shiny. It can be used as money, but it isn't money.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to be a stateless currency, allowing for voluntary exchange between two parties. By introducing mandatory regulation, the state of New York is attempting to impose on the voluntary associations of its people.
Bitcoin exists because value is subjective. The state is imposing on our right to form our value systems when it regulates our exchanges of value.
It's coercion, it's bullshit, and it's anything but for our own protection.

I think Bitcoin is on the right track with transaction fees, personally. Right now we have this mining incentive in order to really increase the hashing power, and therefore security, of the network. The whole point is that this mining phase should be a temporary phase, IMHO.
Once the reward for mining goes away (becomes negligible), the only incentive is to process transactions people are willing to pay for (e.g. legit transactions). I see this as fair, don't you?

Daily is too small of a time window. I believe inflation has removed something like 98% in the past century if you're speaking of the erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar. But that's beside my point.
The current monetary system is broken, wealth extracted by the debt-growth imperative of modern economics. Money is created in a loan when someone agrees to pay back more money in the future. Thus, the ever widening spigot of money is needed to keep up. This allows those closest to it to become richer and richer. It's the Cantillion effect, pain and simple.
Bitcoin is great as it offers a public ledger to protect us from this money creation scheme, but it still suffers from the liquidity preference, like gold, regarding its use as a currency. The money stock is separable from the money supply available to the market. Those choosing to "store value" in the currency by hoarding it reduce the money supply available to the market, necessitating a drop in prices. Since profits can't be made by merchants with goods falling in price, even more money is removed, exacerbating the issue. The boom-bust cycle caused by such currency has been investigated quite well by Silvio Gesell.
Bitcoin is nearly perfect property, but not perfect money. The issue is that money is used economically as a form of credit, not as a commodity. The archaic idea that "intrinsic value" exists is to blame for the confusion. As a result, speculation on this "intrinsic value" becomes the primary determinant of price.
Credit systems built on blockchains offer us a beautiful future, but that future is probably not going to be secured by a form of digital gold.

Right, but it's a liquid store of value. Legal tender laws are draconian. The strict economic controls in place in most nations only hinder the entrepreneurs within them. Allow people to pick a money that doesn't have to be supported by a nation-state and the sinews of war (infinite money) are taken away from the imperial powers of today.
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:51:08
Well this idea of "taking it back" would best be done at the direct, local level. The issue I have is that the state operates using force out of assumed consent, and that's a recipe for the abuse of power, particularly in our capitalist monetary-property system, where the state of run by the people who own the money and property. 
If the people want governance "of the people, by the people", I think we have to stop looking to big brother. Voting doesn't actually accomplish anything, and relying on the people you vote for every few years to look out for your interests has been shown to be ineffective.

The logic supporting the authority of nation-states is weak at best. I didn't choose where I was born. A bunch of rich white dudes came and "claimed" it hundreds of years ago, killing any of the "savages" who tried to stop them. And then they declared a new nation so they could write the rules to benefit themselves and get rid of their imperial British masters. We're just a bunch of suckers who have accepted playing by the rules of people who make them to benefit themselves. It's why just about every tax code is a joke.
The mechanism of the corporatist nation-state is the most oppressive force on this planet. Bar none.
But I guess some people are into oligarchy.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:19:30
Yeah, I definitely see how you could see it that way, but I think someone with less authority as less capable of abusing authority
With decentralized societies, there are far more options for checks and balances. The optimal decentralized solution will be different for every culture and society, but I do believe that reducing the scale of power structures above "the people" would inherently give them more personal freedom. 
Freedom is important to me because I think humans think more when they have choices to make, and they are forced to think critically and ask for help when they have more personal responsibility. 
Top-down solutions to our socioeconomic issues have been spouted at us for a century, and I would argue they've caused more harm than good. State-capitalism is a farce that is used to keep the powerful in power. I reject the influence of the state on the economy because it socializes costs and concentrates profits for a select few. The regulations we have in place allow for industries to expand to economies of scale that are administratively inefficient.
I know I probably won't convince you to see it my way, but I hope you can see that it's in the interest of the powers that be to tell us a narrative about how the world works that paints them in a good light.
I highly suggest reading about mutualist economics if you're at all into free-markets. The concept of unleashing competition and eliminating imaginary property rights to reduce the price of capital to cost seems like a fairly elegant, laissez faire solution to our current state of global economic inequality.
Do you have any recommendations for me?
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:50:41
I'm just speaking out about what I believe. I do contact my representatives to ask for support in defending liberty even though I don't support the state framework from which their power is derived. We anarchists don't have to agree with someone 100% in order to work toward common goals.
You can bitch about people talking about true freedom, as if them thinking about it is a waste of effort since they aren't "doing" anything, but I'd say you're just being cynical. We have to nurture our ideas with debate for them to become a reality. Bulldozing a populace with "improved legislation" isn't going to make anywhere a better place.
Maybe if more people spent their time thinking critically about how to solve the injustices in the world, like how to develop technological solutions to protect people's rights, like meshnets can do for free speech and Bitcoin can do for money, we might see some real change for the better.
But hey, maybe you're right. We probably shouldn't take it upon ourselves to change the world, we should wait for the people in charge to see that our plight for a better life is worth their time. Maybe they'll even give us permission to live the way we want if we ask them nicely enough.
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:05:21
You can keep calling me a child, it doesn't change my opinion.
What I'm reading is mutualist political economy, not fiction.
Nuclear power could be crowd sourced and defensive nuclear weaponry could be handled by distributed defensive agencies, also known as militias. These will exist because they will be seen as necessary by those who understand that individuals must work together to protect each other. These are the modern day minutemen. Free actors, not subjects to a centralized governing body.
I'm not a pacifist, I understand the need to defend against power centralizing systems. Peer-based authority systems will result in more just distribution of power and only become more effective as more people join them.
You can keep saying, "it's never happened, it's not possible, the incentives aren't there." Duh. I get that. That's how we got here. We have to invent our way out of this Capitalistic, infinite growth mindset for an economy and escape the military industrial complex supported by the nation-states of today.
I'm not disengaging, I'm engaging by promoting civil disobedience. I'm engaging by investigating alternative structures and systems of value. I'm engaging by putting my time and effort toward developing the infrastructure for a P2P society.
Hierarchy isn't necessary. You're thinking serially, you're thinking about the way things have been done. Consider new ideas, new paradigms.

I think you're the one ignorant about libertarianism.
The term is currently being coopted by corporate America: 
But I have to say it lead me to the beginnings of libertarianism, which is most often identified as libertarian socialism. It has helped me to see the truth behind state-corporate power more clearly.
At the end of the day, people like to force people to do shit, either through legalism or violence (which it's arguable there's really a difference). Systems like Bitcoin excite people because it's a technological way to stick it to the man. 
We may be an excitable lot, and there are plenty in here who just want things to go to the moon, but Bitcoin is a symbol that declares that I should get to choose my store of value, not have it dictated to me by a crony/state-capitalist government that is in bed with the propertied power elite.
We may be idealists, but fuck, at least it's better than the "just give government more power so they can take better care of you" bullshit that neoliberals having been spouting for a century.

The wealth isn't productive, even when it's invested. People are productive and can be more productive with access to wealth, hence they pay a premium for access to capital because the wealthy are in a position to charge for it. The old, "what's in it for me" attitude.
Usury is as old as record keeping itself, people as a whole are just too self-interested to stop engaging in it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:07:55
I'm not trolling, there is a difference between being productive and facilitating production, which is missed in our passive income obsessed society that worships "financial independence". A tool, which is what wealth becomes as capital, does not produce anything by itself. Tools must be worked with, operated, or in the case of automation, programmed and maintained.
The whole notion of "letting your money work for you" is a euphemism for the fact that you're actually reaping what someone else is sowing. Taking a risk can yield compensation in a productive endeavor, but what is risked is not actually producing anything. That feat is performed by the sweat of someone's brow.

One thing I think you're failing to see is that massive accumulation gives an advantage to lenders, as they become the only people "credit worthy" enough to create money. This allows the lenders the ability to live as a leach off of the interest of those who need access to credit to trade their goods and services.
For more on this concept, check out what Silvio Gesell had to say about basic interest.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:19:25
I'm more in favor of a currency with a demurrage or a "decaying currency" - it would encourage investment as inflationary currency does, but without giving those who have accumulated the most of it the kind of advantages they hold today. I also think we need credit/money creation to be a distributed power, not a centralized one. Think if voluntary credit unions created their own tradable currencies or credits. My favorite idea is a decaying currency that is continually "mined" by remediating environmental wastes in order to maintain a consistent availability of credit and internalize the unrealized costs of ecological destruction.
I think state backed currency is an awful idea and robs individuals of the right to choose their own systems of value.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:29:13
Not in the currency. I don't think it's that great of economics for everyone to be striving to hold currency as opposed to use it. That's one of Bitcoin's biggest issues, in my opinion, people look to hold it speculating on a "value" increase rather than use it.

I'm in btc for the long haul, the price is just a fun way to see how its purchasing power is growing. My end game is to use it to buy things in the future with that savings. I'm not here to sell out and get rich quick off of unsustainable growth rates. I'll let the day traders play that game, I don't need it.

Are there any unfair barriers to entry in Bitcoin mining to prevent more people from competing? If not, this seems like a pretty good idea.

I wasted about 19 btc on a housing remodel that didn't work out nearly as well as I'd hoped for back when the price jumped above $1k a few years ago.
I would certainly talk myself out of it if I could talk to my past self.
Bitcoin has always been a long play and I would feel much better if I would have just reminded myself of it back then.
This might be a bubble. It might be the beginning of wide spread adoption. It might be the new normal. Nobody "knows".
What I do know is I believe in the technology, it's a better form of money. If you want to buy good with the BTC, do it, but if you're just cashing out, try to think about what you will prefer in 3 years, 10 years, 20 years. Try to just enjoy the ride.

I wish I wouldn't have remodeled a house at 1200. I could have made way more money just buying a little more. 
Now I buy a little bit a day every day, and it's awesome. Best savings account ever. Fun to buy stuff with it too.

A unit of account that the State has ordained that it must be accepted for all debts public (e.g. taxes) and private (your mortgage).
"United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues."

That's not necessarily true if the money is consistently traded for goods and services. There are existing nonstate credit networks - Sardex is a pretty cool one.

I guess what frustrates me with our Constitution is it's distributed power framework has been destroyed by the decisions of the Supreme Court (like Marbury v Madison) and the 11th, 16th, 17th Amendments.
The 11th might be the most egregious as it essentially says that the States can be sovereign and above accountability to individuals without its explicit consent. It gives a governmental body greater rights than individuals. This amendment was passed to try and promote a decentralization, giving sovereignty to states to not have to submit to the federal courts, but the concept of greater rights for any government above that of individuals is flawed. Plus, the federal government later decided that is has the right to abrogate a state's sovereignty utilizing the 14th Amendment anyway, so we essentially are just left with the worst of both worlds.
The problem with the Constitution is that its authority isn't based off of the consent of the governed, but rather declares the rights to authority by a self-stated, sovereign body that has the ability to aggrandize itself (history has proven that). 
I personally believe we need a new "social contract" with our fellow citizens, that truly treats each individual as equal, rather than subjecting every individual to the unquestionable authority of a series of governments. It's likely that confederations and republics would be formed in doing so, but they should be created through voluntary association. 
Yes this is idealistic. That doesn't make it wrong.

The point is to give them a commodity that stores value better than the greenbacks they're forced to use by legal tender laws.

Well thanks for the honesty everyone, I know I tend to be idealistic, so your comments have been quite helpful to reign me in. 
I just figured to direct depositing could make it more convenient for the both of us, but I guess I just wasn't taking into account the great deal of skepticism he'll have in the matter.
I'm just trying to do my part in helping get more business into the Bitcoin ecosystem. I guess it does make a whole lot of sense to just have a conversation about it first.
Thanks again for the criticism.

My thoughts exactly.

I don't necessarily believe in the Constitution. If you believe in liberty, you should read No Treason by Lysander Spooner.
The U.S. Constitution has provided the structure for the centralization of power in the United States. The whole point of the Constitutional Convention was to streamline the use of power by the central government as the Articles of Confederation limited the central government too effectively. I'm not saying they were perfect, I'm just going out on a limb and saying that it's of no coincidence that some of the most ardent supporters of the Constitution were also ardent supporters of the United States first national (read: centralized) bank.
People deserve the freedom of choice. We each deserve the right to determine our value systems and I would argue that should imply our right to choose as our store of value. The market has a great way of naturally incentivizing us to use the most effective and widely accepted forms of value storage. It's why our species invented money in the first place. It's a natural market tool for trade.
Freedom is about treating the individual as the unit that interacts with society. Believing in a 200+ year old document granting the federal government the power to grant itself further powers doesn't cut it for me.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:59:21
I have thought of it this way for a while now and would love to see it more commonly used. What gives currency value is the network effect (more people to do more things for more people). I think of it as the first digital, trustless trade network, is this accurate?
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:56:46
I'm arguing that the dollar is used by corporations and banks in cooperation with the US government and excessive regulation oppress the economic freedom of the majority of the people across the globe. The current financial system quite explicitly exploits the Cantillion effect to enrich those closest to the creation of money. This manipulation of the money supply is completely unjust.

When read as a document of enumerated powers for the federal government, it's not such a bad document. I'm very aware of how rapidly we were centralized utilizing our imperialistic fervor for becoming equal with the rest of the world's super powers at the turn if the 20th century. I still would prefer further decentralization of our decidedly divided United States as the Constitution had been thoroughly used and abused to rob us of the very rights it was written to protect. I'm admittedly a big fan of the Free State Project.

Having no interest in the discussion doesn't make it untrue that taxes are coercive instruments.
Government, if selected as an instrument to provide a service, could be paid for as any other service, with a fee. If government is the most effective provider of a service, the service will be voluntarily delegated to them by the community.
If government is the necessity that you refer to it as, those who believe in its services should foot the bill. 
Government is part of your belief system, structured around the use of force to improve the behavior of individuals. The laws  and government you support require compliance, not consent.
