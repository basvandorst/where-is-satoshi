That is exactly what happened.

At the top of the page this is a "withdraw" button.
People who want to use the bot to tip can "deposit" coins into the bot   and then tip people.

Thanks for that extra 1%. I didn't see any posts on when I posted this and thought I couldn't be the first one to see this.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:36:48
Yes. Got the same thing and posted about it as well. Defiantly a phishing attempt.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:48:05
I don't think that means the unknown 39% is coordinated.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:53:06
I guess we also don't know if a few pools are cooperating. They could already own over 51%

Just hope that some people see this before it is too late.

Good luck everyone!

I'm with you thinking that this bubble is going to pop. I just haven't decided if I want to short sell... It makes me feel a bit scummy.

Yes. An advantage of bitcoin is that there is no way for a charge back to happen. Paypal can do a charge back where you would be out bitcoin and cash.

Yep. The BTC will be gone forever. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:26:31
I [see]( what you did there. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:37:47
If you can make it then go for it. Also make it easy to add funds and you could be the next big exchange on the block.

While the article makes some really good points about bitcoin transitioning to being used as currency and not speculation, it is pretty hard to still say that this is not a bubble. The people who have made the big bucks on this one have already cashed out. If you want to make some money off of the trend right now is to wait till it crashes/drops in price and buy some then.

I spent a week in Winnipeg for spring break and since then have been very fond of Canada. Good luck guys!

I hear ya. I wish I would have made a Mt. Gox account when I was mining bitcoins last summer. I just chashed out using coinbase which was a really dumb idea since I want to buy more coins after this bubble pops. Right now I'm number 7720 in the verification queue and coinbase is "out" of bitcoins to buy. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:05:03
I've had no issues. After I was verified I changed my password just to be safe.

This guide goes to the extreme: 
You have to ask yourself how far you are willing to go to secure your bitcoins. If you make regular backups of your wallet on some solid state media, ie a flash-drive, you will be pretty safe. This is to protect against you wallet file getting corrupted/lost with a HDD crash.

Running the client contributes a  node to the network... 
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:11:10
Just use [coinbase.com]( I was able to sell/buy bitcoins right away.  
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:27:18
I can't use dwolla to add funds unless I'm verified. I really don't want to do a bank transfer or loose 4% off the top. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:52:31
Electricity for free means the only factor on how longs it takes for your ROI is the price of bitcoin. That being said, if you could live with out ever making that money back, go for it. Never invest money your are not willing to loose.
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:18:10
I was worried about how strict you wanted the ELI5. When I see that on [I get a little nervous and think that 5 year olds shouldn't be using bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:42:19
This. I have a TrueCrypt container that I use Dropbox and GoogleDrive to backup. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:31:13
Currently encryption is perfect. The client uses AES-256 to encrypt the wallet. Now if you choose a bad paraphrase or have a key logger then you are SOL but that is not the fault of the encryption.

You should mine with [No fees :D
