Considering lost and burned BTC, there is room for hundreds of thousands of exploit-driven new coins under the 21M cap.

Others may condemn your homophobia, but professionals understand that talking about your fears, even indirectly, and getting your fears out in the open is the first step in the healing process.
My thoughts and prayers are with you as you confront your demons.  I urge you to continue with your struggles against your fears and your upbringing.  
Good luck!

When I think of the area of grass I reach with a scythe, I think of pi \* r\^2.  Very simple and elegant.

e \^ (i \* pi) + 1 = 0   cannot be made simpler or more elegant by introducing a "2" somewhere.

Let's take a look at PV-powered mining, using central Washington as an example.
Let's use NREL Red Book data for Yakima, WA.
Average daily solar insolation for a fixed tilt system tilted at latitude is 4.8 "sun hours" per day.
For this discussion, the "sun hour" value is the integrated incident solar energy represented
by the sun instantly appearing normal to your PV array each day, then disappearing
after a period of 4.8 hrs - producing the same integrated incident solar energy produced by the sun travelling through it's range of incident angles over the course of a day and year.
Industry-accepted figures for total system efficiency for a PV system is 83% (with the losses being due to heat, soiling, module mismatch, inverter inefficiency, wiring losses, shadowing, and a few other factors).
So the math for 100% net metered PV powered mining in Yakima is:
Per watt miner energy requirements = 1W x 8760 hours = 8.76 kWh/y.
Per miner watt required PV system size = 8.76 kWh/y / (4.8 h/d \* 365 d/y) / 0.83 = 6.1Wpdc per miner watt (peak DC watts being how PV modules are rated and sold).
For horizontal single axis tracking systems in Yakima, the required PV system size reduces to 5.0Wpdc per miner watt.
For dual-axis tracking systems in Yakima, the required PV system size reduces to 4.4Wpdc per miner watt.
Fun fact:  Total global installed PV capacity at the end of 2018 was about 400GW, providing sufficient energy for about 80GW of miners.
At 0.1W / GH/s, one can claim that 800 x 10(18) H/s can be supplied globally by currently installed PV.  That's 800 EH/s.
800 EH/s is about 10x the current combined BCT/BCH hashrate in operation.
