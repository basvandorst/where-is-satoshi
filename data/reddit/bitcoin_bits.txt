A [bit]( can refer to many things. The key is context.
If you are selling something for bitcoins or '1000 bits' how many people are going to try to send you 1000 bits of entropy?

And yet i still feel violated.
Thank you :)

I'm not American btw. My country uses metric. I just don't think its practical exchanging micro- and milli- units of bitcoin in fast transactions with 100% confidence, and i think it will hinder bitcoin as use as a medium of commerce.

I'm glad someone understands and can express the reasoning behind it in a more eloquent way than i can :)

Did you read it? No one is calling satoshis, bits
1 bit = 100 satoshis

The bit in bitcoin was initially referring to computer bits, but that fact doesn't mean we can't hijack its definition. 
In what situations do you see confusion between computer bits and bitcoin bits arising?

I fully grasp the metric system. My country uses the metric system. Just not for its money.

His time is worth the same as anyone else's. There were no barriers to entry for you, you both had the same chance to prosper, it is just that your friend had the insight to see something in bitcoin that you didn't. His time was 100% an investment. He could have spent it playing Battlefield or posting memes on reddit, but instead he read up on mining, hashes, asymmetric cryptography, securing a wallet, all the overhead that comes with understanding bitcoin, and this is when it was worth nothing, when there was little financial incentive and far more uncertainty.
9999 times in 10000, you would have been right, this thing that looked a bit like a scam would have amounted to nothing, and you maybe would have mocked him for wasting his time.
But in doing so, it means that that 1 time in 10000 when he turns out right, you have to just hold your hands up. You know what, you saw something I didn't, because there absolutely is skill and vision required in seeing an obscure an opportunity as bitcoin was in 09-11 and acting on it.
The guys that have made millions holding bitcoins from back then, i can not begrudge them. They saw something that 99% of people couldn't see, something most would have dismissed and even openly mocked.
Everyone is a genius when they are shown the answers. Everyone can see how easy it was in 2010 to get some bitcoin, because hindsight isn't a skill.

That wasn't the point you were making, you were stating no one knows what a bit is, I said that they would know because we would tell them.
A [bit]( can be many things. Some divisible, some not.
A 'bit' when referencing bitcoin can be whatever we define it as. It's not a binary bit, it is a 'bitcoin bit'. We are hacking the original name of the currency to make it accesible to people that are not used to using si units in everyday life.

I'm not saying it doesn't work for measuring food and liquid goods, but food and drink isn't primarily being used as a peer to peer medium of exchange.  If you can easily discern how much you need to pay by the time you've ordered in line at a coffee shop then it is useful as a currency.

There are a few errors in the exchange. I left them in because i think it puts emphasis on the point i was trying to make.

Exactly. Bitcoin, expensive!? It's 1000 bits to the dollar!

Until it is used by a few and picks up momentum. How is any linguistic meme spread? There wasn't a press release one day on the merits of using 'lol' in texts, someone just used it and it caught on. Everything in bitcoin has to be like this, because there is no central authority. If people start something, and it works, it spreads.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:18:09
Pretty much yes
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:10:24


Yes that's a good idea, i'll do that.

I feel like if i add a tl:dr to the top, people open the page and form an instant opinion before even getting to my reasons for why i think it would be practical. 
I have no problem if people think it's dumb/will not work etc, but hopefully they would at least understand my reasoning, and come up with their own constructive arguments, and they can only do that if they read the text.
I made the main conversion bold for you though
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:22:59
Ah, yes. Editted, thanks.

I think it's two things.
1) People don't like change. This isn't even change really, it's just a slight shifting of our use of language when describing bitcoins. It imposes no changes technically.
2) People find it hard to relate to people that do not think like they do.
How many times in this thread can you see 'Well i think SI units are easy' as though their personal ability to grasp a concept is somehow a universal measuring stick. I even stated, that it isn't about mBTC being a 'hard' concept, it's 1000th of a bitcoin, we get it. Its about the psychology of using the subunits of something for what will become the base units of the currency.
There will be very smart, logical people who can not fathom why we would need 'bits' when we have microbits, but while microbits solves a technical solution, it fails if we define our goal as making bitcoin as user friendly as possible. 'bits' is a marketing suggestion, not a technical one. 
It's about psychology not mathematical elegance. There are good reasons why companies have marketing departments and they don't just get the system engineers and programmers to shoot the ads.

Do you know anyone that wants to buy some micros? I know some people that want in on bitcoin, i don't think they want my micros.
I've seen people stating that they are buying Litecoin because 'Bitcoin is too expensive'. This is actually happening. People dont want a sliver of something, they want a whole something. I don't want 1/10 of a bitcoin, i can get 40 litecoins for that!

I live in a country that uses the metric system. 
Obviously it can be used, the question is whether it is the most efficient way to classify a digital currency.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:04:33
By what definition? A bit of binary data is indivisible, sure. A [bit]( as an expression referring to a coin is absolutely divisible.
'Credit' is better than micro-bitcoin. I would still worry that people would be put off only being able to afford credits and not 'a bitcoin'.

Satoshis doesn't deal with the problem of a new user wanting 'bitcoins' and getting sent 'satoshis' ie something 'other than bitcoins'. 
Remember if the price appreciates a lot over time transactions involving a bitcoin will be rarer and rarer, to the point where, we'll only be using this subunit.
Doesn't it make more sense for bitcoins to be known as 'bits' over 'satoshis'?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:33:45
People don't want satoshis, they want bitcoins.
