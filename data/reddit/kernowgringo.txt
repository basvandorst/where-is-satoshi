Feel for you, an untimely death especially to someone close to you is a hard thing to comprehend. 
I also had mine stolen in a phishing scam, had been using and buying them since they were £6 each. I had 1.4btc when they were stolen, worth about £400 at the time. It was money I was putting aside for my kids as my first one was on the way. I've never got back into buying more and actually get bouts of feeling quite depressed when I look at how much it's worth now, it would be the most money I've ever had.
Reading some of the comments in this thread is actually making me feel not to bad about it.

Also make sure to get someone to take a photo of you and post it online.

I used to think they were just Internet drug tokens.

Oh really, will have to look for that next time I'm down there.

Was only talking to the Mrs last night about how I think I'll start a store on open bazaar, selling plants (legal) when it becomes stable and on windows. Guess this is the first step to that, better start propagating some more plants. 
Anyone interested in buying interesting edibles such as a red/purple wood sorrel or Chilean guava how about an avocado tree for your house or maybe an Aeonium or a Haworthia?

And here is the screenshot I just took while watching...
Seems I'm slightly late on this one.

I sent the person who posted the link on a message asking for my coin back it was They've just posted the same link up in and deleted the one in @_date: 2014-01-30 21:30:30
Well and that of course. I'm more interested as it looks very similar to some of the towns and villages around me. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:13:36
Where is your shop? The reflection looks like small town rural England.

That'd be good. Although I could've easily had mine locked down better. I'm normally really good at checking everything, this just caught me at a time when I was totally relaxed playing with my daughter on the sofa while casually scanning reddit front page on my phone reading stuff and being blissfully unaware while I entered my password and pin number, until I heard the blockchain notification noise and there went my BTC.
Feeling a bit better about it today, I'm more annoyed at myself for letting my guard down but then also being annoyed that I have to have my guard up when dealing with BTC at all times because people are actively trying to steal from other people. 
It won't stop me though, I'm already planning to buy some more but will be putting them in cold storage. I've been trying to spend a little then buy some more for quite a while now as I see it as a way of saving for my daughter, in fact I've just bought her a mobile for her cot and some baby grows with BTC via pock.io, thankfully she is only 4 months old as there could've been a lot more there to be taken. 
Sorry to blab on I haven't had anyone to talk to about this today and you've (unfortunately for you) been the first person to talk to me about it.

Nobody convinced me to do anything. I'd been holding bitcoin and using them for the last couple of years, just recently I decided to use them as a way of saving money with a pretty good chance of a nice return if I played the long game. I only ever bought as much as I could afford, so I don't have any savings now but I'm not broke. 
I'm the only person to blame.

Business tip...change that horrible font. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:37:39
Thought as much, complaint filed for what it's worth. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:15:34
That's how I'm treating this "lesson learned". Just talking to the girlfriend about storing the majority offline next time I get some,  including the one I persuaded her to buy a couple of weeks ago which luckily she has in her own wallet. 
Thank you for your offer, I'm not looking for any kind of hand out, but I'd really like of those coins so I'd be happy to purchase a small one to start my offline storage. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 10:50:24
Nothing here either, but then I'm kind of used to that (Cornwall).

PTP and BTN both use bitcoin for donations as do WCD and SCC. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:57:26
Thanks, pretty sure it won't happen but it was worth a try, stranger things have happened. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:53:30
Correct me if I'm wrong, if you had your money stolen from an atm scam like that chances are it's insured and you'll get it back. However when my btc were stolen through phishing there was no chance of me ever getting it back. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:53:33
Something better, beanies!

Can I interest you in a range of exclusive stuffed bears?
@_date: 2016-09-04 08:30:07
At least you didn't have them stolen from you, like this guy. I was making a savings fund for my just born daughter at the time, buying little bits here and there, then one hazy, sleep deprived night I got a fishing email and fell for it, next thing I know heard the blockchain wallet app notification noise and bye bye savings. Was pretty depressed about that for a while but hey, you live and learn. 
This is the only time I ever felt my bank account was better than my BTC wallet. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 12:43:13
I don't remember in BTC but it was about £450, quite a lot of money to me at the time and now it is still more than I currently have in savings. 
At the time I came on to here and asked if there was anything I could do and was told beyond asking for it back, there wasn't. 
I got fished for all my login details by an email seemingly from blockchain.info offering a new loan service which I thought sounded interesting, it linked to a page to sign in and...I signed in, so really it was completely my fault, I gave out all the details needed to take my coin. However had I not been sleep deprived from having had a baby and at the time also being a full time student doing a BSc I don't believe I would have fallen for it.
Somebody on here did gift me some coin just to get me up and going again I think about $10, I think without that I would probably have given up on BTC all together. I do have about £30 worth atm just waiting until I'm flush again one day to get back on the rollercoaster proper. 
This was the theft...
And here is the thread I originally made....
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:20:05
Sorry to hear about this. I know how you feel, had all mine phished off me a couple years back, was also my life savings and money for my kids. It's horrible and really hard to trust the whole btc scene afterwards. I hope you can move on from this, I've had to just try and forget about it although it does still make me think "what if..." from time to time.

If you're prepared to live in the 1950's with a lot of scouse accents then the Isle of Man is for you. Seriously I spent two weeks there with work and couldn't wait to get off the island, very quiet, boring place with lots of old(er) people as the young folk move to the mainland pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:31:00
This I believe, the other post(s) are just people trying to show off who know fair well how much BTC they have. They're not happy with just having a good amount of BTC they also want worthless internet points as well.
