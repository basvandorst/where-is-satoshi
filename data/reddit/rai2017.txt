Bitcoin whenever it rises a lot has boycotts, mainly of the miners.
Now to Antpool and Asic as it grants 20% more fees to miners.

@_date: 2017-08-07 19:00:46
Those who are using robots in btc trading should be losing a lot. Exchange rate and rates does not cover the sale and repurchase.

You need to be careful with BCH currency that is rising. This is mirage she will return for 400 dollars. The equivalent was donated to btc holders at the date of the fork. She could never reach the value that is.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:08:36
Bitcoin will drop a lot:
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:43:30
But I agree that it was good for you without a doubt.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:41:00
I think it's great if btc goes for more than $ 10,000. But whenever btc rises a lot comes negative news from the Chinese bank.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:51:51
The fix will come undoubtedly remains to find out how much will fall. I think it would drop a thousand dollars from the point that is currently or more up. (Ex: from 4 thousand to 3 thousand, from 5 thousand to 3.500 thousand and medium)
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:48:26
Excellent explanation.   Grateful
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:24:06
There does not seem to be a drop like the one portrayed in the meme. Lol.
I think it was some wobbly hands that must have gone crazy.
In Wall Stret is already decreed that btc less than 4 thousand is promotion they will buy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:50:19
Bitcoin is incredible. You can see in the power of reaction. It is soon to be 4500. I think it is investment to be seen in the long term and not in a sudden drop or sudden increase. It will be 6 thousand soon
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:01:34
Does not have bitcoin for everyone who wants. Only a little limited maybe a couple of million pick up and hold and finished the offer. There will be only demand.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:52:58
But I do not think it would drop 50% from 6 to 3
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:10:04
Will reach 5 thousand dollars this weekend
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:41:30
It was good for you that you can pick it up now at 4060.
But I think if you wait, you'll get 5 thousand
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:48:47
Do not exaggerate. It did not fail nothing was a minor correction. I just bought it in 4040
I was hoping to buy lower, but it will not.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:11:05
Silver is now linked with gold. Litecoin will go to eth
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:57:32
I do not know what will happen with the BCC or BCH, BTC. Two coins using the same network. This is hilarious.They say that the third one can appear the B2X.If it will occur , will dominate BTC,BCC or BCH and B2X.  ETH market, DASH and ZEC will be behind.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:29:28
I believe the original and true is the BTC others will be free mirrors. Including BCH that was generated for free.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:53:30
That way it will not be anyone who will have a btc.
Even why it is used worldwide and has a currency limit.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:29:57
Now the meme is buoyed by this rocket
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:00:07
Very good explanation, I fully agree. This explains why there is market value. Through negotiation and money flowing through buying and selling.
But about Bitcoin is incredible.  It is soon to be 4500. I think it is investment to be seen in the long term and not in a sudden drop or sudden increase.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:09:05
I think now who sells loses.  I think they started investing after the news yesterday.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:03:39
Poloniex give BCH to btc holders at the time of the fork? Anyone have news?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:54:08
Everyone knows that in the world we are 7 billion and 600 million people in the world. If 0.2 percent want to use (20 million) wish to have a btc to use it will actually reach 500 thousand dollars. And who sells now loses even because there are people coming in with so much publicity. I want to see if they get the btc from the margin what price it will arrive in a day.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:56:46
I do not know how long you know btc, but bought very expensive.
All icos when there is hard fork, they tend to fall and people migrate token.
Btc will be diluted between BTC, Gold and BCH.
I think there will be a drop in btc on the eve of November 15th.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:31:28
By the information I have the fork occurred between October 24th and 25th and 25th they released the portfolio of Bitcoin Gold. But they are still perfecting the wallet.
Who owns btc on this date will receive the same percentage in btg.
On the site you put your wallet to know if it will receive your bitcoin gold
Website: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:46:53
Your opinion is interesting. No doubt that BCH and BTG will rise much more than DASH and ETH. They use the same network and underlying technology as BTC. I do not believe they will get btc someday, but they will appreciate it a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:50:50
I fully agree, btc is the Father of cryptos.
But what I want to talk about is that BCH came directly from him like blood running through the vein.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:34:10
I agree for several reasons:
First why without reason it rises and then descends if it is not a manipulator behind.
Another thing why it falls if btc values, at the minimum it had to maintain the added value.
Btc also has strong manipulation, there is no amount of btc in the exchanges that appears this is game of exchanges, you can even see that poloniex and bitfinex are collapsed so that a penny falls in one falls in the other.
If it were decentralized there should be disagreements. 
In fact I do commerce but I am very careful with all currencies including with btc.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:26:42
100 thousand have signed up and btc has not left the place. I think btc is tired has some keeping it high, but buying to save looks like it does not .
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:09:37
I think it is not yet time to buy btc. I think that miners migrating to BCH now and the new token bitcoin gold on November 15th will now dilute somewhat the investment in btc. I think wisely it is better to wait a few days and see until deep bottom it will hit btc. My guess continues that it will drop to 5,000 or maybe less, but do not be surprised if it drops to $ 4,000. But Btc is king and next year goes to  $10,000
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:37:15
What will happen until November 15:
Will be delivered the bitcoin gold token.
You will then have 3 bitcoin: BTC, BCH and BTG or Gold.
Bitcoin will have its value diluted among these three, everyone will use the same technology.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:50:01
Now it's at 7680, I do not know what's going to happen this weekend if there's going to be a dump or you'll value it even more. SegWit is paused. Turbulence about whether miners will support.
You have to pass this phase of btc.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:35:05
I'll wait for correction.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:34:50
I'll be honest btc took years to reach 500 dollars was only in May last year that reached 540 dollars.
BCH has already reached 1770 dollars. I think BCH and gold will be very good! There is a tendency for BCH to pass btc in six months.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:42:05
the correction came faster than I thought, bitfinex will cancel operations in the USA in a few days this growth was wrong for now. Then I will invest in btc.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:48:09
Correction novices will be long. Two factors will play btc down: Bitfinex will close in the US and some are holding up hard fork, then will dump heavily. 
I think it will reach 5 thousand dollars
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:41:43
Btg and bch are good options, currencies that have already come up with a great added value, each of them already worth billions.
It caught my attention BTG that according to the news, bitcoin gold is trading at $ 384 and has $ 500 million in daily volume, according to CoinMarketCap data.
CoinMarketCap does not yet reveal trading in Bithumb.
But after there is a wide acceptance in other exchanges like bitstamp, poloniex and other Asian. 
It will have the value greater than eth.
If someone disagrees tell me.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:56:16
I disagree with you for the time being, until November 15th, anything is possible. It may fall a little more.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:55:36
I agree. When there is correction after the fork and some pick up their gold.
May fall a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:57:44
A little propaganda and manipulation does not hurt for BTC.
They push up with high concentrations of buying and then withdraw buying support to sell their btc
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:47:57
I respect your opinion very much. But I think there will be parity. Because the technology is the same. It does not matter if the camaro it is green or yellow, the motorization and underlying technology tends to determine that only the color does not change the factor.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:46:24
It is the next few days it is not good to invest in crypto. Wait for the pulley to lower
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:01:23
I think ght he'll go to 3,000 again by the end of the week
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:08:44
I agree with you. Everyone is watching and I think if China forbids btc and the altcoins later this month as they speak we will have a huge drop in the coins. But I think this will be beneficial in the long run. I even think that for all currencies not just btc it would be nice that it did not have a great concentration of one in any country. It could be something polarized. So there would be stability.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:20:13
Weak hands, China is talking about raising funds for new ico and has nothing to do with btc eth and other

I had forgotten, thanks for remember
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:36:03
I think some factors have contributed to recent falls in btc:
- Fork hard and recent altcoin btc cash trying to compete with the true bitcoin.
- According to comments from China wishing to block btc.
- Comment of btcc close at the end of this month, the latter if it is true btc will go for a dive again as traders will dump.
But overcome this is only joy
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:38:28
But if China will close all Chinese exchanges it is inevitable that all currencies will fall by the end of this month. Because people will dump both in China and in other countries due to panic.
I do not know how much it would fall if mining also stopped
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:55:53
I think the weak hands have already diminished

@_date: 2017-09-22 11:50:55
I think it was a bluff armed with big businessmen and investors. There will be no prohibition even if I was already suspicious. Even why China regularized btc a short time ago and it would not even make sense to ban a thing that generates income for them.
China will not want to lose the mining it would pass to other African countries where energy is cheaper
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:37:37

Only weak hands think that.
On October 1 they announce that it was a lie and btc goes to 10,000. lol
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:46:43
The Chinese are like this: When btc valued they created problems, now they spoke of the altcoins. But today they have already reported that banning new ico is not permanent. This is all manipulation
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:09:52
Now that they have confirmed that the news is false and manipulative, get it now or you will not be able to get on the spaceship

This weekend looks good for btc
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:55:56
I agree perfectly, it seems that bad news only draws attention so that more and more people are interested in btc. China has already lost the reign of btc, btc is the world. If the Chinese sell other will buy it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:45:52
The problem that China is strict and if it is banned and someone gets caught trading is a serious problem. I think the rest of the world will have to absorb the btc that will leave China. No one will take a chance.

Watch out for tokens like Augur (Rep). Will be withdrawn from the Chinese market. I think you can prepare for a huge fall
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:34:48
feeling,  It is based on two aspects:
1 - It increased the number of inscription at the moment that the exchanges of China are closing.
2 - Price btc did not leave the place even with this large number of subscribers.
So I think they migrated and now they will operate in dollars or instead of yuan.
You may notice that there is already a drop in the btc price rather than a raise.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:24:09
I like your opinion and I agree. In my opinion they negotiate the generated tokens of the I like your opinion and I agree. In my opinion they negotiate the generated tokens of the hard fork and after the falling price they pass on to the users.  That's great business.

Chinese government will never will ban btc for several reasons:
Largest btc mining is in China.
Greater circulation of world money and injection into the economy.
False news for some to benefit from falling and accumulating weak hands and those left on the sidelines
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:36:40
Bitfinex is shutting down operations in the US on November 9. So I believe that many will sell btc by then. For now be careful. It could drop by 20 percent. But if you find that it falls less you can speak.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:01:59
Anyone who has watched the subway hijacking 123 knows that those with bad news about btc want to make a living to buy. And make no mistake if you do not have big business people wanting to get btc right now. Another good thing in btc is that if 20 million people each have a btc they will only buy 0.0001 btc who has money
