So with tumbling, bitcoin isn't relatively transparent and makes it more advisable for such criminal use?

How does tumbling impact Bitcoin's transparency?

As an example:
    Deposit 1.2 bitcoins into pool 1 from address "A" at time 0m:
        at time 30m .372 bitcoins leaves pool 23 to address "B"
        at time 43m .125 bitcoins leaves pool 3 to address "C"
        at time 65m .628 bitcoins leaves pool 126 to address "D"
The user controls address A, B, C, and D. Yes, you can trace where bitcoins from "A" directly go, but they are not in possession of the user anymore. They're sent to multiple addresses not associated with the user.
This doesn't seem very transparent and (as far as I'm aware) hasn't been able to be dissected by blockchain analysis methods.

Define "Bitcoin blockchain." In many people's opinion, the Bitcoin blockchain would be the majority. If a minority start a side chain, can you say that they would be "attacking the blockchain"? Orphaning their blocks would prevent damage to the actual (majority) blockchain. Why is everyone ok with changing the POW but not the block size? I think changing pow would impact Bitcoin negatively more than a block size increase.

Do you know of a website that tracks block sizes/%full/etc?
This has the average block size, but doesn't tell me how many blocks were completely full.

If old, unspent addresses are bruteforcable, all addresses are bruteforcable. If someone can brute force address, they get "free" bitcoins by taking from others. This would make bitcoins useless.

Ah, my bad. I see what you're saying. Must be my lack of sleep. :)

If someone could bruteforce a private key they could bruteforce every private key. This would most definitely make bitcoin worthless.

Most people (I hope) won't install a closed source patch with their private keys vulnerable.
Are there any examples of exploits that Bitcoin core has patched and how they handled it? 
 Fix exploit, create binaries, push to repo?

Now if Google wallet could be a bitcoin exchange like circle... That'd be perfect! NFC payments with bitcoin, etc.

It made them think of a currency system where it wouldn't be possible for that scam to exist.
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:47:03
Because why not.

Why do you recommend running it on Tor?
