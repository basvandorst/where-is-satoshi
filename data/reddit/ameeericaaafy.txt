As debt has the same purchasing power as cash, they are the same thing, and therefore will be subject deflation everytime new debt is created. You may reassure yourself that the real cash you hold is real, but that is meaningless in an advanced economy

So about a week ago me and my wife sold our house and invested the proceeds into Bitcoin, should we be worried? The price has dropped so fast in the last 24 hours

I think you have misunderstood. By saying that Bitcoin can be created, this is saying that Bitcoin deposits can be created though loans, and these deposits will eventually have the same purchasing power as Bitcoin cash, therefore can be defined the same as Bitcoin cash. Simple economies begin with cash only as its the only thing you can trust, and over time the economy needs to facilitate the creation of credit as people have the desire to borrow. Over time more businesses will accept Bitcoin credit and they will begin to trust it as a form of payment, the same way your local shop let's you use a credit card as they trust the banking institution to honour the conversion.
