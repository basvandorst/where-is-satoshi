as someone who runs a small business, this is cool and all, but currently taking bitcoin is not a smart business decision
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:56
if the dollar doesnt, then everyone is fucked, if bitcoin doesnt, then he and a few idiot interneters are fucked.. i typically go with the safer option 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:54
good this is like crazy school (i bought a little myself just for the fun...
if you can manage this, you should be able to make good money in the real markets.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:19
its amazing the way your mind can convince it self that specific things  will happen if you say it enough times.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:36
you need more than 46 people to think it has decent value when its priced at 19k.. i didnt say itll be worth 0 but its not something your gonna retire on if 46 people think its awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:32
your gonna have the crash
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:10
its a hobby to me its like extreme motorsports investing.. 
but i wouldnt put a dime into it before i was set financially to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:54
yes perpetuate your losses with a lie, that wont make things worse at all.. /s
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:24
sure we all have, thats how we learn unfortunately..
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:50
if you couldnt afford to lose it, thats fine, yea but its super lucky that that it is true now, its also just as easy for that to never have occured and you lost 100% of that money.. its just not a safe investment.
funny that people are arguing that it is when its dropped 35 percent in a week.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:16
this is not "a little risk" its high risk high reward potential
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:45:31
you should be putting those little bits of cash in retirement, not bitcoin.. 
i cant say im suprised but people on the sub are really financially illiterate.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:03
Retirement funds are great, but you can't dip into those if you have an emergency. A standard savings account makes a very small interest, and should be used for an emergency fund. That should be considered "full" when it can cover 4 months of living expenses without aid. Then and only then should you look to the long term investments.
 obviously, but investing in stupidly volitile shit like bitcoin is dumb if you dont hae all those things put in place
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:31
or some much smarter investments.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:07:07
your a moronic idiot. there is no stability. bitcoin has not been stable since it was worth anything
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:48
thats what iv been saying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:49:01
well its gonna get better now, with people in the low middle class (who paid taxes at their current incomes) will pay alot lower taxes going forward
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:44:30
if you have debt, would you buy stock in a company with no knowledge of what that company does, and everyone else already invested knows but you?
thats basically the choice your making with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:59
yet here we are...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:44
it only has value if people believe it has value, well peoples faith in its usabilty is dropping like a rock, hense value dropping..
if all x people who know waht bitcoin is, believe it has no value, then it would have no value, if you and one other guy believe it has value, than it only has value to You and that one other guy.  you wont make any money either way
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:42
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:07:48
im not disagreeing that having a small portion of money your willing to lose put in high risk high reward investments.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:52
its more volitile than a company thats actual earnings, and what they do is part of the equation
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:14
i just dont understand the logic in your decision making processes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:34
eh more like 60ish
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:54
this is like extreme day trading though, there is no basis for its rises and drops other than the feelings of other holders and prospective holders.
its like an unregulated stock where you get no info about the company your buying
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:44
r/personalfinance is shit....
but if making millions is boring, sign me the hell up
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:10
they are stupid i insubbed years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:00
trust me iv made so doosey decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:08
you should note, that putting your transaction on a block costs the miner.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:35
i didnt say it was inappropriate, i have some, but people saying its safe are misleading people to believe that it isnt a insanely volitile "investment"
if you put 30percent of your networth into bitcoin, you have a really good chance of losing.. its very high risk high reward.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:53:36
if i told you to buy into a stock where you know nothing about the company, but everyone can have insider trading, you would laugh at me for suggesting i should buy it.... but here we are.. 
people see this as some form of get rich quick scheme, and it might be for some early adopters, but reality is when it does crash, alot ALOT alot alot of people are going to get stuck holding the bag,, and while its entertaining to watch and see the extreme ups and downs, im getting 10-12 percent over my 30 years of work time to retire with millions with out too much of a worry
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:53:36
its def risky, because you would have to report the income and it could cause your non-profits total gross revenue to fluctuate greatly.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:57:06
you have no guarantee of a positive return just fyi
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:48:32
what if i want to buy 1 bitcoin, whats the best option for doing that? that doesnt really cost me several hundred to get
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:53:36
if a nation prints too much money it devalues and inflation increases alot.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:11:11
im looking at that, i see the price is lower than the price i can buy it at? is their a better option which i can set what price i want to buy it at?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:25:48
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:44:42
if he did this, he is an incompetent idiot. i dont care that it may have worked out for now, but if he did that, and failed, i would have 0 sympathy for him.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:40:47
those people are horrendously stupid
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:47:21
welfare and "not wasteful" dont exist in the united states.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:26:11
no, im saying that its been fairly volitile and it does have sharp downturns in its past..a s well as sharp upturns.
it only has value because you say it does, or i say it does, and gov/billioniares ect talk good or bad about it, or someone sells off a big ass chunk of it, it effects the price drastically.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:48:25
there is nothing about bitcoin that is low risk.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:03
you arent forced into bad debt, you chose to
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:48:44
not even true though..
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:39
basic math is hard for bernie beliebers.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:16
lol.. if only.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:42:40
if your putting money you cannot afford to lose in bitcoin, no quality investment advice is going to save you.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:16:01
if you invest your life savings into one thing, like bitcoin especially, you're a dumbass, and shouldnt be investing in anything.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:05:22
sorry was on my phone earlier :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:14:06
untill its worth 0 then you hold worthless nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:43
yea, i didnt say it wasnt an investment, its just very high risk because its prone to movement like it has been doing its entire existence that cause it to jump up or down at the drop of a hat because someone sneezes wrong about it in a foreign country.. stocks do jump too, but generally, most people arent heavily watching small individual stocks daily that they own.
bitcoin is interesting case study for me, as an investor, because it behaves like a stock, if that stock was the focal point of the media on a daily basis.  
do i think bitcoin is bad invetment, mostly, that doesnt make anyone stupid for doing, it, you just have to have high risk tolerance, amd diversify your investments accordingly. 
my hope with bitcoin, is that its buyers will see how easy it is to get in and involved in investing, and invest in the market.. the education in the usa has been faltering so much on investing, and im glad for bitcoin for getting people excited about it.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:45:53
and bitcoin isnt? bitcoin isnt even tangable like the dollar, and vitually everyone in the world will take a dollar.. your ignorance is profound
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:05:22

@_date: 2017-09-13 19:44:16
the usa is much safer investment, because 70% of the population of the world trust it will be there. while bitcoin, 1% of nerds in america hope it might be safe 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:45:08
its because hes trying to say bitcoin is better than the dollar, and it isnt, and never will be, but saying what your saying doesnt make the value go up or interest more people into bitcoin.
