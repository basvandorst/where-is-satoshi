Ooh, I guess I offended two Bloomberg fans.  Sorry folks!

Is that a deposit qr code? Im always confused how those work
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:19:54
Read that as "because of the federal gay area..."  
Definitely did a double-take on that one.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:10:55
So this is basically a qr code that sends bitcoins to that guy? 
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:26:53
Bloomberg is crap.

As someone who bought a few right during the first big ~650+ (then touching to 1000'ish for a bit) boom and then bought ''stuff'' on darknetmarkets and then saw it dip below ~250 I am kind of sad. I first got it as in investment and then used it and then it dipped and then it started climbing again and bummed out that I spent it and didn't rebuy it before this recent boom. Still, in the big picture happy-ish to see it doing well.

Ive been struggling with real regret this last month. Not just fear of missing out but having the opportunity and knowledge of it early on and also having ultimately bitcoins (2011/2012) but then spending most of them when they were around 700, and I got them as an investment, but I still spent them and I know life goes on, but I've been really struggling with my decision making skills in that regard, I could have done so many things different, and it's not my only regret. But it's been hurting, I have a mere fraction of what I once had, and I know I can get more, but it's just a deep cut.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:13:57
And also actually missing out too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:52
I don't have as much  bitcoin as I once had, BECAUSE I was using it, on purchases and things, that now I obviously regret to some degree, but I am one of the individuals that contributed to it's viability as an actual form of currency and trade. I just wish I had the amount I once had these days. But that's life, there will be future opportunities, and to think otherwise is just an unending stream of doom-thought, which doesn't do anyone any good, especially yourself. Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:32:38
I don't have as much bitcoin as I once had BECAUSE I have been using it instead of just investing it. And I regret not saving more, but I can say I'm at least doing my part to contribute to it being an actual used means of currency and trade. I just wish I had what I once had, but I'm managing the waves of regret and second guessing with trying to make better decisions in that regard in there here and now. But I partly agree with your assessment.
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:30:01
Man, I forget how brilliant that scene is.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:47:25
Same, I was told and aware of bitcoin in 2010, and then I bought some in 2013 and then used it till about 2014 (I mean I suppose that's what it's there for, but I feel physically unwell when I see these, I know I'm not the only one, and I have things in other cryptos but there is definitely an epidemic of perceived-btc-missed-opportunity-induced-self-beating-up that goes along with these things. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:42:38
Curious as well, every time I check preev (as someone who used to own a few and no longer do) my spirit and soul cringes. I know it ebbs and flows, and it will continue to. I think some of the financial uncertainty has a BIT to do with it, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:39:58
Ugh, I used to have it (them) for so cheap, and then I went to Silk Road... Oh well, glad to see it's doing well for it's own bigger picture reasons!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:25:27
It is always smart to get it as soon as you can. Its fluctuating now, but the talks of 1 bc becoming multi-thousand worth is too much potential not to be a part of.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:52:06
Bummer, so do you think the people that tried to buy and have their processes "Pending" will go through?

So what does this mean for people who bought during that window, cause mine still says Friday the 22nd.
Has this rule changed for the many different people at these different intervals of time? Like does the person who bought it even before the Friday the 22nd things rules still apply to them, or for people that did get the 22nd thing, or afterward?
Cause in many ways, If its low I would love the amount of money I paid to transform into bit coinage of whatever market price is for Friday the 22nd. Of course if its high I would love for it to be the price it was when I purchased it. See what I'm saying?
Thanks :)

It'll take .5 of a Lambo for 1 Bitcoin by then *crosses fingers*!

Doesn't coinbase have their own in-site wallet?

Likewise, I just wanted to buy and sit. Let it see where it goes. Plus, its better than sports.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:45:36
Yea don't worry, I think a lot of the "old coiners" are becoming a bit over-protective (and rightly so) with the onslaught of new people with the same old questions.  
I talked to a guy who was in on it in 2010 who I'm sure is doing well. But instead of talking about nitty gritty numbers, we discussed the concepts and mechanics of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:54:43
Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:05:10
Yeah I was always curious how the coinbase delay will play out.
So what does this mean for people who bought during that window, cause mine still says Friday the 22nd, When it'll become available.
Has this rule changed for the many different people at these different intervals of time? Like does the person who bought it even before the Friday the 22nd things rules still apply to them, or for people that did get the 22nd thing, or afterward?
Cause in many ways, If its low I would love the amount of money I paid to transform into bit coinage of whatever market price is for Friday the 22nd. Of course if its high I would love for it to be the price it was when I purchased it. See what I'm saying?
tl:dr hopefully its low and I get more worth of bitcoins, if thats what is still happening.  Still some confusion here.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:58:40
Thank you for the help!

Yea, right now is a waiting game for a LOT of people.

Good point, I think what he meant was that the chances of getting blocks are extremely low.

Now playing Devils advocate here:
What happens after you print it out? Is it just a piece of paper with a ton of digits on it?  What if you lose the paper? Is it only on that paper, or is it like a 'receipt'? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:31:49
It's my understanding that BitCoin is  and LiteCoin is  , am I incorrect in looking at it like that?
I mean obviously BC is No. 1 but how do the others rank from there?

Thanks, I appreciate it.  lol I love LMGTFY.

I wasn't trying to cancel ever. I want what I bought... Did you read what is written?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:40:17
I thought that isn't happening anymore since coinbase is back up?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:01:00
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:16:04
I would imagine in the years to come BC's will begin showing up (if not already) on wills and trusts.

Just looked into coinsetter.  
What are its main attractors? Different than any other trader.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:32:48
I feel for you bro/ma'am. Hope you find some sort of resolve. I'm sure things like this will continue to streamline. As long as my pending coinbase investment gets to me by Friday I'll be able to breath better.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:29:07
That's cute (in a masculine handsome sense). 
Would you be able to explain how the Casascius coins work? 
There is like a hologram that has the actual block number on it right?  
I'm just kind of confused about the concept of it. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:14:15
How do I sign up for that? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:49:07
Now if I am not mistaken, attempting to mine actual BitCoin right now is a bit futile correct?
Granted there are a slew of alt.coins available to be mined, right?
|Edit: altcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:11:41
I just bought one today. I am new too :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:15:47
Now I wonder because that thing about "till friday" was only for a little bit. I wonder if the people who bought during that window feel screwed. Because a short while after that happening, Coinbase came back up and I got one within that time. It may be pending but it shows that I bought 1 BC. Unless the friday thing is still happening I think it was just temporary. Thats why there were all those "Coinbase is back up" posts.
|Edit: I would buy as soon as you can.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:47:28
Personally, I just invested yesterday, and Im not planning to sell anything untill AT LEAST a year from now.
