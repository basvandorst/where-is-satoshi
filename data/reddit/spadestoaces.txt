I’m not really sure how I feel about this. Doesn’t this defeat bitcoins purpose?

Someone has to find Carlo’s wife and see what her reaction is xd

There was some story I read a while ago where the TSA held a man back because they wanted to "count" his Bitcoin like it was a physical thing. I'm kinda worried to bring my Ledger to the airport because they might try to "count" it. I'm pretty sure you could refuse to unlock your Trezor on a computer but it would still be a hassle getting held up in all of that.

Oh okay. Thank you! :)

For the Ledger Nano S you can add multiple wallets. I'm not sure about Trezor since I don't own one of those myself.

Better safe than sorry. I would highly suggest a hardware wallet, it might be pricey but it's worth it.

Thanks! ��

It’s a little too much in my opinion. That amount of growth is insane.

Once the lightning network is implemented, Bitcoin's speed will be increased and fees will be lower. Good luck finding a "stable" crypto.

Suprised they didn't start bashing Bitcoin. Good to see the media is seeing it in a better light.

If the file size on the computer is too large you could try to compress the photo

I ordered one and it took about a week to deliver. I would suggest buying off the official site but if you can't buy it from Amazon. Just make sure it's not resold or anything.

Is this real? This is great. xd

Turn on 2FA on your Coinbase account and use Google Authenticator with it. If you really want to have the maximum security, get a paper wallet.

For a web wallet, I like Blockchain.com. For desktop, I would say Exodus. If you’re really looking to keep your Bitcoin safe I would suggest buying a hardware wallet. The two best ones in my opinion would be Ledger and Trezor.

Every Bitcoin transactions has a fee tied to it. This is to reward the miners. It is completely normal.

It kinda irritates me when someone who never listened to me a few years ago asks me about how much Bitcoin I have. I usually just don’t respond or say “I have some”.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:29
Geez, it just pisses me off people would actually do this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:17
On one of the pages, it says they emailed all minor accounts. I would suggest moving the funds to another wallet.

Coinbase stopped people under the age of 18 from using their site. This is in the US, I’m not sure if that applies to the EU too.
