I'm going to buy about 10 coins to start off. Is an online wallet secure enough for an amount like that? I have a blockchain wallet and I can make a cold wallet through it (not sure how that works).

If it benefits the companies they will want the consumer to use it. If thats the case then incentives will be offered if the consumer uses bitcoin. Ideally anyways.

Another thing to consider,
Bitcoin is the father/mother of the cryptocurrency space and altcoins rely on btc.
If we can't even think about other cryptocurrency communities because we're too focused on fighting/greed what kind of example does that set for the rest of the crytpocommunity?
We are stronger together than divided.

I'm not sure what exactly will fix transaction costs and delay. If making the block bigger is what will do it than that sounds good to me. Maybe increasing the block size incrementally over time would be a good option (if that's even possible). Or the lightning network, which I need to look into more.

Hey man, if you think fiat currency is sound money then that's your deal. I think the fed printing the USD into oblivion sounds pretty bad though. I am looking for sound money. A digital gold that is divisible like bitcoin sounds like a much better form of currency to me than federal reserve notes. So yes, one day I would like to use bitcoin for every day transactions.

Derivatives off of real assets/money is what got us caught up in this mess in the first place. Lets not go there again.
Do you know there's around 92x more paper gold than registered gold itself? How in the hell did that happen? Did you also know that the derivative market has been estimated to be anywhere from 500 trillion to over 1 quadrillion dollars when there's only a global wealth of hard assets of about 200 trillion? The banksters are creating so much debt based wealth that all of these market bubbles just keep growing and growing. Too big to fail? Yeah fucking right. These bubbles are gonna crash so hard its going to put the whole world economy in a crisis. If the banks weren't bailed out in 2008 things would have been a lot worse. After the fact, the fed has injected trillions of their phony dollars into the markets propping them up so it doesn't happen again. They are literally going to have to keep on doing this until they print the USD into oblivion.
Their Keynesian economic practices believe that you can keep stimulating an economy and avoid the natural boom/bust cycle that happens within economies by manipulating interest rates and printing more dollars. It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-12-13 02:26:03
I'm thinking long term here. I believe there's going to be a global currency crisis (well there already is in parts of the world). And when the current monetary system falls apart there's going to be precious metals and crypto left standing (well if the grids stay up). I believe gold/silver is too primitive to be a currency in this day and age, so I'm placing my bets on crypto to take this role over. Bitcoin being the largest crypto has the biggest chance of taking over in the event that the monetary system does fall apart. And in order for it to scale to that degree, it has to be able to do every day transactions efficiently and do it with low fee's.

I've been researching bitcoin and have owned it since 2013. Thanks for your completely backwards assumption though. And if you actually read my post instead of reacting you would see I didn't tell anyone how it should be changed. All I gave were criticisms and concerns regarding mainstream adoption (as someone who uses bitcoin quite regularly).

I say hold whatever you feel comfortable with losing and don't worry about the rest. It's a good hedge against the currencies along with gold and silver IMO. If my money wasn't tied up in investments right now I would probably buy 10 or 20 and just sit on it.

I guess it's just a matter of perspective. A fetus is a prerequisite to an adult human being, Just like a seed is a prerequisite to a tree.

It will change our financial and political structure for what I believe to be the better. I think that is huge.

I agree with you mostly. If bitcoin does in fact reach mainstream adoption as a transaction ledger, it will be considered both an investment and a saving.
Say I have 10 bitcoin right now. In 5 years the amount of merchants amplifies to 5 million, I can now use it more on a transactional basis and it will have most likely gone up exponentially in value.
It really depends all on where bitcoin is headed. I remain speculative on it, but I do see it's potential. The biggest issue I see is how volatile to price change it is. That could be a good thing though actually. The more mainstream it becomes, the more people see how much the price has risen over the years and will hop on board thinking they can also increase their wealth by holding bitcoin. So I think speculative investing/self interest will actually contribute to the network effect and in turn make it more usable as an actual currency.
Best bet is just to buy as much as you can afford to lose and watch long term to see what the market decides.
Personally I would like to hold 21 over a long period of time until it either becomes a useable transactional ledger, or remains a store of value. (or of course it goes to 0 and loses all it's value but I cant see that happening anymore).

You are correct, but war is why the gold standard died. You literally CAN'T produce more bitcoin than 21 million. You can take traditional payment systems off the gold standard though. Thats the inherent benefit/difference over fiat that bitcoin has.
Wars were paid for with inflation because the amount of gold they had couldn't match the amount of funding needed for the war.

Brilliant. I agree, then if it was a war people actually agreed enough to spend their hard earned dollars on the war would be fought. If defence was needed in case the country was under attack people would pay taxes for military spending. With the internet these days too it's easier to tell if what your government is feeding you is actually the case.
The problem with funding it via inflation is that it isn't visible to the average person. It is shadow taxation in a sense and wrong. Our economy needs to change to a more voluntary way of doing things.

You do realize for something to be considered 'money' it has to be a store of value right? Currency doesn't need to meet that requirement. Thats why we have fiat currency without any actual backing of money like gold. Enter inflation.
If you are looking for a currency stick with fiat. If you are looking for money then look to gold,silver, or bitcoin.

Interesting idea here. The way I view the whole reptilian ordeal is that, the reptilian part of our brain which looks out for our own survival is what creates all the power hunger in the world.

Whys that? I see bitcoin or at least another altcoin as being the future of how we make transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:46:50
I suggest you dive deeper into what bitcoin is really about. When you start to understand the frictionless/borderless nature, the transparency of it, and how currencies like the USD which rely on inflation of the money supply to sustain itself (akin to slowly poisoning oneself) vs. bitcoins 'deflationary' nature then things will really start to get interesting. The current monetary system cannot maintain itself forever via quantitative easing. It WILL collapse. The only question is when? 
The implications of bitcoin aren't as simple as less transaction fees (although that's a good contributor to the appeal of the coin, no doubt).
Imagine a world where you could travel pretty much anywhere and use one single cryptocurrency (most likely bitcoin) to conduct all of your transactions.
Regarding security, do you not think that the current financial system have security issues? Do you know how easy it is for someone to use someone elses credit card for online transactions? BILLIONS of dollars are lost to identity theft every year because of the outdated tech that credit cards use.
Also, bitcoin is still young and protocols for safety are still being implemented. The beauty of bitcoin is it is an open source technology so improvements upon the system can be made by anyone with programming skills.
Make no mistake, cryptocurrencies are the future of the monetary system. The only questions are, how long will it take for that to be the case, and which coin will be the top dog? My bets are on bitcoin.
Correct me if I'm wrong on any of these points. I may have a naive point of view on the matter. I'm pretty sure though my predictions will be correct.

I'm saying there's benefits to credit cards for the consumer. A credit card builds credit, and also uses money that isn't actually yours where as you can't do that with bitcoin. Credit allows one to say finance a mortgage on a home.
I'm thinking in the terms of bitcoin becoming an international currency. How would it deal with things like that?
@_date: 2015-03-30 00:47:37
Hey man I say fucking go for it. If you have researched the technical aspects of bitcoin against fiat and have come to see how much better of a currency it has the potential to be (I think overall it's better but since the volatility it isn't a good candidate for stable currency useage right now) then why not? As long as you are willing to lose it and can still sustain yourself using fiat.
I would like to have 25% or so of my assets in bitcoin in the future. Right now I'm at like 0.001% though lol.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:18:15

@_date: 2015-03-30 22:44:26
I dont think you understand what you are talking about at all. First of all, don't compare fiat to bitcoin they are two different things. Second of all, yes people actually DO get rich holding something they can see gaining tremendous value over time. It's called investing. Third of all, people HAVE already gotten rich off bitcoin. 
Holding bitcoins in saving over time is an investment. It doesn't resemble traditional fiat currency at all. Fiat isn't money, its a currency. And its also inflationary so of course you won't get rich off interest over time. Bitcoin is a store of value like gold, and a new one at that so early adopters DO have the potential of gaining massive wealth over a period of time if bitcoin continues to develop and gain traction amongst larger groups of people.
@_date: 2015-03-12 07:52:25
Thank you. You too good sir. I have a nagging feeling that we will be quite wealthy in 10 years. In my opinion I still feel like we are very early adopters. I would like more coins in the future but currently I can only afford to lose 21 coins worth. I think 50 would be more my end goal. And hopefully I won't have to cash out in the end, rather bitcoin will have mass adoption so I can start spending my coins instead of using any fiat at all.

Think about it this way. You wouldn't be holding gold/bitcoin as a store of value if you had 100% faith in your currency. If you did there would literally be NO reason to have any unless you were just looking to make a quick buck from price volitility.
Hedging against the dollar especially in uncertain times is partially why bitcoin sees its price increase (obviously theres a few more factors driving its price then just that).
And lets be real here, just because a society endures an economic crash doesn't mean everything is going to turn into a post apocolyptic wasteland. That sounds a little melodramatic to me.

Kind of. What I was hinting at was basically using bitcoin as a hedge against fiat. In other words, you have no plans on taking that bitcoin and selling it for fiat again. Losing faith in one form of money and putting it into another. 
I'm not sure why my comment got downvoted. Obviously you have to pay bills with fiat and what not. Any person with sense wouldnt exchange fiat they need to pay bills and live for bitcoin as the way the world is right now, gotta invest smart.
