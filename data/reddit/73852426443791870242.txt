bitcoin is open source and the ledger is public.
You can see if there are any coins mined or if there is a premine.

You can check the chain to see how many bitcoins were removed from binances hot wallet.
I remember someone posted the actual block yesterday before the hack was announced and iirc it was just over 7000 BTC.

Also the point he/she is trying to make is that bitcoin needs a better long term solution.
I'm not saying the solution is a bigger block, I'm just saying it needs SOMETHING if it is going to be a viable daily global currency.

are you sure it wasn't?
Have you actually tried [googling?](

I think you are making a poor argument.
You first argued that the fees are too high for most of the world.
Starostise follows up by saying that if the fees are too high, then most of the world should use something else instead of bitcoin. 
You then claim/conclude that there is no use case (because most of the world can't afford the high fees).

Do you buy things with gold today?
Does gold have value?
Use case doesn't always have to be a currency.
Many people have already stated that bitcoin in it's current state has become more of a store of value than anything else.

Then don't you lose, as the price goes down?

You are right that gold does have a lot more useful properties than just store of value, so I agree that the comparisons are not fair.
On the flipside, whats wrong with having fees when you want to liquidate/exit?
Ideally you wouldn't have any fees, but at the same time, just because your atm charges you fees for withdrawing money, doesn't suddenly mean that the system (atm and fiat) is suddenly worthless.

are the bank transfers you talk about international?
Do they stay 15 minutes to one hour if you are transferring multiple millions of dollars?
Are 15 minute transfers really even "instant?"
Like I said, bitcoin has its own use case, even if it isn't as a daily currency.

If you are correct, then I misjudged the comment.
I forget sometimes that I don't need to be an asshole every chance I get.
