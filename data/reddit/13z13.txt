Armory offline wallet.

If you combine "OP" with some other letters you get "phaggot". 
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:29:45
And litecoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:39:49
Monero is the only one out of those that has the potential to be a major player in 5+ years....along with LTC. Stellar, Bitshares, NXT aren't even really cryptocurrency. Peercoin isn't fully POW. DASH was instamined and is inferior to cryptonote coins such as Monero.

Good for newbies, but not better than Armory at all.
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:32:37
Yes, correct. I think an Armory offline wallet is one if the best way to store funds.

Using "addresses" isn't for the mainstream.

Just an LTC correction. Expect a couple more before the halving in under 100 days. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:31:52
Yes, I just became a fan. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:59:37
This cause the dip?
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:32:50
"What are you a scientist?"
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:19:14


Damn, do they accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:21:45
Stop spreading lies. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 04:09:25
So like 10k saw it?
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:32:05
Hodl your ltc until the halving.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:57:31
The movement in litecoin is more interesting to me than anything. Something big could be brewing in crypto land. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:12:58
People who predict bitcoin will fail, don't know what cryptocurrency is. Same can be said for bitcoiners who think litecoin will fail.....you don't know what crypto is. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:09:22
This is bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:25:47
My guess is that they did that on purpose. Isn't that supposed to be their main demographic?
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:31:38
Probably subtle reference to Monero. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:02:37
No, I don't think BTC will fail, that's why I suggested puting 60% is in btc :). I think (unlike most here who are baised toward just bitcoin) multiple cryptocurrencies will play major roles in the future. I like ltc and xmr as two of those coins for what they bring to the table.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:30:26


There is no question.
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:36:08
I would put $3000 into bitcoin and $1000 each into litecoin and monero.
