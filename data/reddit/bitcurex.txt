This is the thing we are currently working on. To prevent messages to be marked as "SPAM" the e-mails are sent with delay, sometimes it gets stuck, and requires an admin attention. 
You should have the address by now.
Sorry for that delay.

Im sorry I got accused that I'm craping in some other business?
Im not I really like the idea of bitinstant, it is different and its good, both products are good. I really keep my fingers crossed so they succeed in their project. To see that we have to wait. If their cards will be selling as ours does, they're project will be a success. And Im sure it will be. 
More projects like this and Bitcoin will finally skyrocket, isnt that we all want? So why I should denouncing bitinstant? I really would like to see more projects like this in the future.
I know how hard is to get them, to convince bank, and MC or Visa to let that kind of project to be out there.
There are lots of things to keep in mind with that kind of projects, first of all there is a Bank who gives their terms and conditions, second there is a visa and mastercard, third there are ppl and ppl.
It is not easy to release that kind of product, and bitinstant made it so did we, and they deserve a congratulations.

You can use your name, or if you are ordering something for a friend, his name, or any other name.

Did I said it is not? I said they will, they have great project as in project. Plus the bitinstant isnt a competition, its a completly different form of business. Their product is dedicated to other customers group. And little coz the cards are little, I always say my little babies for our BCC cards. Nothing wrong with that.

Unfortunatelly only GBP EUR USD and PLN, but PLN Mastercard can be used as a multicurrency. MC does not charge extra fee for currency conversion (visa does 2.8%), so it can be loaded with PLN and used as AUD card, but this is unfortunate too. Mastercard gave us some limitations, so only Polish market will be supported. We are trying to do our best, to work this out with MasterCard.

No no nothing like that.
If you remember the famous bitomat.pl malfunction, it is said that the owner wanted to get more RAM to his server, and long story short that was the reason for bitomat to crash and loose 16 000 btc. And it is a joke if something is not working ie. our exchange when we had DOS, the joke was we were adding more RAM. So the buterfly labs not as scam but waiting time. It was a fast brain though. Sorry if I offended anyone or gave a false impression about my words.

Sure they will. And I really wish best to bitinstant so they succeed in their little card project. I myself sign up for one to see if its another butterflylabs or just standard "production" time which is 6-8 weeks, each time for individual card is ordered. And we have them now no name is needed. Virtually no fees for using this card.

The shop is working again. There was an minor error with the BTC payment module
@_date: 2012-08-21 22:28:53
Not yet at least. We will work on that issue CAD, AUD and other currency as well.

@_date: 2012-08-21 22:27:33
It was just a joke. A simple joke. Maybe it wasnt funny Im sorry for that.
Im sure all is well with bitinstant and their cards, Im ordering myself too.
@_date: 2012-08-23 11:51:48
Well there is a difference. Bitcurex is an exchange bitinstant is an currency exchange. They buy and sell bitcoins, we only provide tools for user to trade them between other users, sort of like stock exchange. 
You want more differences? First of all waiting time: None the cards are available all the time you don't have to wait 8 weeks for the card. Second: You have to control over your finance, when to sell BTC at what price, Third: its Visa not MasterCard more: who cares. What is more superios for their cards over BCC? besides fee shedule waiting time, ohh and BTW 
A word from a MasterCard international from 18hours ago:
"MasterCard has no relationship with BitInstant. There are issuers who allow the conversion of Bitcoins to US dollars and other currencies, delivered on prepaid cards. However, we’re not aware of this particular programme from BitInstant.
source: money.cnn.com
Hmm let me think the main difference. BCC exist, does have a bank to support the technical account of the card, and does guarantee the safety of the gathered currency on the cards account, as we can see from MasterCard International they are not aware of any of bitinstant program. But I wish them best to succeed with the MC company.

Bitinstant is sort of payment processor, we are bitcoin exchange, so it is completly different. Plus our card provide anonymity, and you can use our card as a gift to someone, the card does not have any card holder name. Our product is more for ppl who like to trade bitcoins, but they want to have fast withdrawals. That is why we are working on implementing the Target2 wire transfer system. It lets you withdraw or deposit EUR in SEPA area within several minutes. So the wire trasnfer is fast. Not every bank in Europe does support it.
