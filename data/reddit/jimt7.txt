Believe me i understand, did you want an essay on the subject !  . The key fact in this discusion is that mining BTC uses lots of electricity [ yes ? ] . The 2nd key fact is that the people who seek to discredit BTC use this as part of their argument. I have met many people who will not buy crypto just for this reason. What i am saying is remove the basis for this argument, whilst doing the right thing . I have invested in a large solar array and also buy green energy from the grid simply by switching provider .... I am happy to learn from you and am interested in hearing the facts your refer to ?

Good points. In Britain we have the option to switch to a green energy provider and support the industry whilst giving crypto a better profile . I would be interested to know which other countries offer this choice ? 
I believe the more ethical BTC [ or any crypto ] becomes the more chance it has of survival.

With respect I think you undermine your point with jokes. For many people the effects of polution is a reality. I choose to use green energy for political reasons as well as ethical. The more demand for green energy the more goverments will invest in this sector . Too many people plough on and don't give a dam how there life impacts on others . Personally I would prefer to succeed without stepping on others . Isnt this what BTC is about ?

What i'm talking about is a reality the electricity consumption issue is already out there mentioned on British prime time tv only yesterday.Head in the sand wont work its reality. What i am saying is miners could be pro active and switch to green where they can. I am not sure how it works in the rest of the world but where I live we have a choice and I do purchase green electricity [ even at night ! ]  In addition to BTC I also have envion who do run on green energy so it is possible . To me its about positive change
 not just making money otherwise BTC and the intentions which drive it are no better then fiat.

Interesting do you think anybody has the ability / power to drop BTC down to $ 2 or less   ? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:19:14
Yes I believe in anything thats right . Energy companies are already refusing to fuel mining why not check out the facts .
