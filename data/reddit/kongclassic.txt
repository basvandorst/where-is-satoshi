I know my losses are only small 3000LTC at $1 sold and changed my mind at buying bitcoin at $14. For me in a way it makes me happy and sad inside as i would have had a lot more money but it makes me happy that i was on the right path. If that makes sense

Do you only use verotel for affiliate accounts? Was looking if you had the option for BTC payout.

I go to a local dump weekly and have been getting any hhd ive seen and using recuva never found any bitcoins but have found a homemade video of a girl dancing in pants and a bra. I think the chances of me finding that would have been very slim but still hopeful for some coins.

I used nice hash last weeks for a test and it works well but there is no point you might as well buy the coin direct as you get more.
