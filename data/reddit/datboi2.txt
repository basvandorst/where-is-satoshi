Is copay good enough? I already downloaded it and set it up.

Yea the ID thing kind of threw me off a bit. Just looked at Indacoin and it looks great! Looks easy to use and quick. 
How are the rates? 
Edit: Woah they take away a lot. If I exchanged $5 USD let's say I would get only $2.8 USD in BTC.

So the more you purchase the less is taken away from you? 
Also is the Inner portion of the site any good? Where you can buy and sell. Looks like the prices are better there.

Oh okay, I see. Does it give you a random one? I imagine that is how you sign into mobile, desktop versions as well.

Thanks :)

What is the deal?

I am only gonna be storing amounts under $100 of BTC. 
I heard Copay is a pretty good application that can be used for Windows and Android. I would like to be able to manage from mobile.
What do you think about it?
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:16:55
Yup I really like it, it's nice. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:28:53
So if I got the one you recommended all I would have to do is enter BTC address in Indacoin? I am just looking for something quick and easy. 
And to send I would do that within the wallet.

I heard a lot of people complain about something with circle, forgot what it was. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:40:41
How long does it take to get your ID approved and all of that? I am having some problems with Indacoin, declines my purchase for some reason. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:14:15
Thanks. Is it better than Copay? 
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:09:02
Ok gonna try out Circle right now, nothing else is working out. How do I get the BTC, already made an account. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 20:21:20
Why do you prefer circle? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:08:40
I also just heard about Blockchain. 


What is the purpose of this? 
Sorry for all the questions man, I really do appreciate your help. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:47:58
Do I really need to purchase one of those devices? I taught there was something that I can do on my machine.
I am not into trading or any of that, just payment and receiving.

I got it written down, thanks! Anything else I should know about Copay. Is it slow? Prone to bugs? and etc.
