Difference would be one person is SQUATTING on an asset waiting for the rightful owner to pay them some money to obtain it at some point in the future... versus actively using the asset to mislead/extract funds from people.
One is taking a risk and hoping to get paid by rightful owner... the other is scamming people out of funds.
If registered MCDONALDS and squatted on that asset hoping that some day McDonalds would want to purchase the asset from me, would that make me a "scammer"? I think not.... happens all the time in domain name system.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:57:50
Yeah... Has to be a scam.. Not just someone squatting and hoping for a payday. *read sarcasm* Funny how everything is a 'scam' by default.

the conversion rate scaled based on how early you burned.
Here is one of the first burns where 1 BTC = 1,472.00000000 XCP
Here is one of the last burns where 1 BTC = 1,000.09090909 XCP
Here is a list of all of the burns

Guess you live in a world of "opportunistic douchebags"... as almost EVERY good domain name that exists today went through a few "douchebags" hands before arriving at the final owner.... including bitcoin.com, amazon.com, google.com, etc.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:39:53
1 BTC = $454.87
1 XCP = $1.19
1 BTC + 1 XCP = $456.06

For those of you who would like to see the corona.info video "Satoshi's Ark" which has since been removed from youtube... 
The internet never forgets :)
EDIT: video removed at authors request.

This is great news. Really looking forward to seeing what they are working on over at symbiont. :)

I wish you luck on your project. Please be prepared to do a full AMA before launching your crowdsale so that you have plenty of time to answer any questions without any distractions... and hopefully avoid some of this backlash on your next launch :)

The video did have some background music and sound effects, but no talking or anything. Unfortunately I was unable to capture the audio with my screengrab tool :( Perhaps Daniel will be so kind as to post the previous version with audio at some point in the future. Reguardless of if corona.info is a good investment or not, that video is internet gold ;)
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:32:10
That is the marketing video that was clearly featured on the corona.info homepage for the past few days... then for some reason the video was made private so we could not enjoy it anymore :(
I just captured the video and reposted for others to enjoy.
Doesn't it just inspire confidence and make you want to invest? :P
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:35:48
Since your saying the video will reappear at some point...Yep. I'll take down the copies as requested. Please ensure that these videos get posted in the next few months ;)
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:36:35
Thanks for the clarification ;)

Great work you guys are doing over there! keep it up ;)
I am curious on your thoughts on the Counterparty fork "Dogeparty" and what are the differences/advantages of using each platform as you see it? Are the faster block times and cheaper transaction costs associated with Dogeparty a threat to Counterparty? or do you see these two platforms serving different needs?
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:34:23
Awesome! keep up the great work! :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:47:58

@_date: 2014-02-04 03:40:55
that is ok, I found another thread you posted in on and tipped ya 100 doge there instead..... you can't stop the power of DOGE tippers ;)
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:18:53
LOL... Ya, I can totally see how counterparty, an open-source platform built on top of the blockchain which uses a fair proof-of-burn system to distribute its internal currency is TOTALLY a scam.

This probably explains why bigvern seems so nervous in this video with which was taken a couple weeks after the theft.

Yes! I got hit with my ethereum FUD text wall a few hours ago.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:51:50
segwit == pack more transactions into 1MB blocks (small-blocks)
BU == increase block size to allow more transactions (big-blocks)
It all boils down to what is the best way to grow bitcoin.... small-blockers prefer to to keep things stable, blocks smaller, and force scaling solutions higher up...... big-blockers just want to increase the block size now to increase capacity and lower transaction fees.... for a while at least.
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:58:47
Thats funny... looks like pretty consistent news updates at :
Also... if the devs bailed on the project, who is writing the EVM code?
The FUD is strong with this one.

Great news! Keep up the great work CP team :)
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:56:41
Correct. I meant "The most secure blockchain"... Ethereum has a blockchain, but it is not secured with the same amount of hashing power as Bitcoin, and Ethereum is switching from Proof-of-work (POW) to Proof-of-Stake (POS) at some point in the near-future.... whereas bitcoin will always be POW.

multiple news stories on XCP today, I believe it is perfectly fine to post links to multiple stories... this is not highlander.. there can be more than one.

The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.

You write down a wallet seed so that in the event the hardware wallet is damaged/stolen, your able to recreate the wallet on a new device using the seed. You also can password protect the wallet so that even if someone get manages to get your wallet seed and enter it on a new hardware device, they still would need to know your password in order to get access to your funds.
