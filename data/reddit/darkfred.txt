Because the exchanges are currently trading at very low volume. Arbitrage of a few hundred bucks is not worth it. And the low volume means any major purchases or sales could trigger a move in the opposite direction, eliminating your profits.
Arbitrage is only useful where it represents a tiny fraction of overall trading volume.

I read it this morning in  . But it looks like the language has been clarified since I read it.
edit: mcoenen pointed out the exact line on page 4 of the search warrant. "On May 9, 2013, the Honoroable Stephanie A. Gallagher issued a seizure warrant for the contents of the Mutum Sigillum LLC account at Wells Fargo".
Apparently this particular seizure order is only for one dwolla account. But makes reference to another search warrant for the WF account. This makes sense because why would they only seize one? And the one that wasn't involved in the illegal activity?
Two options, they seized both, and wells fargo doesn't comment on this sort of thing (they don't). ~~Or, my second guess is that mt gox stored funds in dwolla and only used the wells fargo account for international transfers. So only one needed to be seized.~~ (edit if they have a warrant they will have seized both already)
Hopefully they didn't keep a lot of liquidity in USD in the US. But it's highly likely that they did, and that all of it has already been confiscated.

Also a Wells Fargo Account. Which probably contained mtgox deposits in USD. That's what people are worried about. Not the dwolla thing, they are worried that mtgox lost a huge chunk of liquidity and that when they announce it it will cause a run on the bank.

lol so true. I got out at 150 and resisted the urge to get back in at 240 for the bump to 1000. don't regret it. 
Trade to hold a position.  If you get out think of it as cashing out. If you get in think of it as a long term investment.

They reference in the warrant, another warrant to seize the WF account. So we have to assume that it has either already been seized or has a hold on it in preparation for seizure.

I was certain I saw that the first time I read it, then I couldn't find it again. So my original assumption holds. We have to assume that the feds have all of MtGox USD reserves that were held within the united states. This might not be all of them, but it has to be enough to service transfers over at least a two week period, so a lot of money is tied up.

Some more armchair analysis.
This isn't a bad thing for US customers. Stay with me....
We have to assume that mtgox has lost a lot of USD liquidity, permanently, (this is a seizure and forfeiture not a hold). So savvy US customers are buying bitcoin to remove their USD from mtGox's books. 
So most of the USD trade is to buy. But foreign sellers are still willing to sell btc without a real devaluation. Which means that mtGox at some point in the future, after foreign cash reserves run out, is going to need to convert a lot of USD to cover the sales in foreign currency. How much USD do they have left. At this point all of the US customers have removed fiat positions from the mtgox market. So Gox is taking two more hits. They now have to convert currency at a possible loss, and pay the conversion penalty. (1-2.5%). 
Can they cover these additional costs after losing a portion of their USD reserves already? This is when the run on the bank happens. But it doesn't really affect US customers, because all the USD has moved out of our accounts and into the accounts of foreign bitcoin sellers.

says everyone who is desperately trying to get out now before volumes collapse on loss of new funds sources.
