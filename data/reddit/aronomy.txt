To be honest it took me a bit of time. Had to magnify it on the screen a bit and find the perfect depth, but my phone eventually got it.

It may be what the internet strives for... but it's ridiculous to anyone who knows anything about computers and the hardware that makes them to claim that they're "modeled" after humans.

Deficit includes all tax receipts vs all expenditures for a year. Debt is more nuanced, as it doesn't include all tax receipts vs all expenditures.
This happens because we have programs that take in (and spend) money outside of the standard budget. Social security has it's own fund. If it takes in 1 trillion from payroll taxes in a year, but only pays out $800 billion, then it has a surplus of $200 billion dollars. Let's say, hypothetically, the entirety of the rest of the budget was at exactly a $200 billion dollar deficit. Then the budget for the year would have a deficit of $0, yet the national debt would increase by $200 billion, because the federal government now owes social security fund $200 billion dollars extra.
Currently the federal government owes a lot of money to the social security fund (trillions). On the one hand, that means our total debt is *not* actually $17+ trillion, since we owe some of that money to ourselves. On the other hand, it does mean the federal government has completely raided the medicare/social security funds for all their worth, and indeed there isn't *real* money in these funds to cover deficits in the future.
If you look at when we were running surpluses in the late 90s, you'll see the national debt increased ever so slightly every year, even though we were taking in more money than we were spending. This is because the treasury owed social security more money (and other funds that the government has created).
Interest, as suggested, is indeed factored in to every budget every year. It is not an outside budget item.

Youtube is centralized. Bitcoin is not. The size of a central repository doesn't matter. The size of a decentralized chain that everyone running a full node needs to have matters a lot.
The devs will work on compression and reduction. Still a problem after many many years though unless they can do something awesome.

It doesn't affect the chance, but it is the line with which you'd determine is it worth it to take the chance.
For instance, if the probability you were to be beaten is 1:3, then it's obviously a terrible terrible idea to add in the transactions. If the probability is 1:1000000000, then go ahead and add in the transactions and get your extra .04 btc, it's so unlikely it'll happen you might as well.

You just keep solving blocks until you catch up and surpass them. The protocol forces the longest chain to be the chain. All you have to do is ignore the other blocks being published, then eventually come out with your own longer chain. That's why at 51%+ it's a guarantee that *eventually* you will have the longest chain.

You claim realized gains on your taxes. You can write off some realized gains with realized losses.
In your example, you had a loss of $250, which you could write off capital gains with. The $600 purchase is meaningless at this point because you haven't sold it to realize gains or losses.

If you want a serious discussion, which it's evident no one on here does, then here you go.
The treasury doesn't back the dollar. The fed backs the dollar. The fed is a bank. The fed has assets and liabilities, and they do match each other in value. The liabilities it has is the dollar. It issues the dollar and buys assets of equal value with it to put on it's balance sheet (these assets can both appreciate and depreciate, but they should be safe assets). It carries assets like gold, morgage backed securities, and, yes, US Treasury bonds. To acquire these assets, it issues dollars as a liability on the bank. Does this make sense? It's pretty simple and yet no one seems to understand it.
It is a bit unique in the sense that it issues something it can create as a liability, but really it helps to think of it as you would any other bank (or credit union). It has liabilities, these liabilities (for let's say a credit union) are the money you have deposited with it that you expect to be able to redeem at any time. It has to pay interest on some of these liabilities (like CDs and savings accounts). It uses that money to have assets. These assets are usually loans to businesses and individuals, or just simply cash on it's balance sheet. The fed doesn't pay interest on the dollar so it's liabilities are pretty well defined, unlike a normal bank which has what's known as interest rate risk since they don't know what interest rate they'll have to pay to keep your deposit there, but that's another story...
So what backs the dollars the fed issues? It's assets. It has assets that it owns. A lot of which at the moment are morgage backed securities and US treasury bonds. It also has other assets though, including a fuck ton of gold, other currencies of the world and other more trivial assets that I'm not going to mention since they're such a small component. Is it a perfect system? No. Does it need to be changed? Yes. Am I a believer in Bitcoin? Absolutely. But let's understand what the dollar is, what backs it, and what the actual institutions behind it do. As opposed to blind (and thereby misdirected) hatred.

But without confirmations, you could in theory double spend those bitcoins, offering a much higher tx fee on the second spend, and if it gets included first, the transaction you just did completely visibly in front of this person is now negated. Or do I have this wrong?

I don't think you understand what flawed means. It means we find out it's a one to one function and it can easily be solved all at once, no matter the difficulty. Right now we have to keep guessing and hashing it through the algorithm, then checking to see if we got it right. If we know how to get the answer then the difficulty is trivial, everything could be solved.
With that said. There will be no flaws found in SHA-256 (IMO at least). It's a mathematically proven non invertible (not one to one) function.

Lol, it's not a belief. It's KNOWING the mechanism by which the USD is created. But yeah, this graphic isn't too far off. They somehow list the US debt at near 60 trillion which is ridiculous. And they seem to think that the US federal government issue of debt = money creation which is NOT the case. But all in all, it has some pretty realistic points. For instance, banks do multiply the money supply through fractional reserve lending, and yes those that have a share of the fed do earn a 6% dividend. But the crux of the argument that US debt = creation of money is false, but with QE now ongoing, not that far from the truth either.

Well it's Morgan Stanley on NYSE. But I think you're right, he's referring to Microsoft.

Central banks don't just hand out money to their member banks. You can borrow and pay back with interest obviously. And sometimes a bank even needs collateral to put up before such a loan is made

What if the second transaction includes a more hefty transaction fee. As opposed to zero, let's say it has .0001 as a fee. Then wouldn't the miners prioritize that one first?

It's wrong because the U.S. federal government doesn't issue currency. The federal reserve issues currency. They buy assets with it. They are a bank (a central bank in fact). So what happens is they issue a liability, for instance, a U.S. federal reserve note (currency) or excess reserves which they can choose to pay interest on, or other types of liabilities such as swap agreements, and in return they get an asset. This asset could be U.S. government debt, securities of other sorts, or even stocks, houses, gold &amp; silver, other currencies, you name it. The point is, this is not the way money is created. Money is issued as a liability of the federal reserve system in return for an asset which they keep on their books. Now we can debate all day long about which assets are appropriate for them to buy and what type of liabilities they should be issuing, what they should be allowed to do and for what reasons et cetera, but there is no room for debate on how the dollar is issued.
