Also, turn on 2 factor authentication for coinbase, your email, bank websites, etc. and any other web accounts you use in your life. It’s a simple stronger security measure that’s only annoying once or twice.

Yes, one is called Winklehoss in the bedroom.
The other you ask? Winkleloss 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:31
Yep.. fuck the government right? You're taking the risk.. but if you win.. they get a chunk.
Same with selling a house for a gain. Theyll take 30% of that gain too for no reason.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:02:43
Do you mean, for example, you buy $20k of BTC, then next month, sell $20k worth of BTC (still leaving you with some BTC)? If yes, this is a gain and you'll need ot pay taxes.
If you buy $20k of BTC... and sell all of your BTC and it exactly equals $20k (No gain or loss), then no you don't owe anything as you didn't lose or gain anything. This still should be reported but would show as a wash between the two.
in USA of course.

Same. This is just play money.. and should be for everyone.
If I lose.. well that sucks and I am out some money.. but not enough to ruin my life. But if I win... oh boy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:13
Money laundering.
 *nice*
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:08
Fair points. I am just in this with play money.. so it wouldn't be the end of the world... but also would totally suck as well.
Honestly, I'd be more worried about losing my cold storage lol but I understand where you're coming from and appreciate the info.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:23
People very much use it and it's increasing daily.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:19:09
They don't have the manpower at the moment. THey can't keep up with the traffic. It'll get better eventually.

It's the Winklevoss Twins I knew it.. I just... knew it!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:14:35
Felt the same.. just bit the bullet and bought in.. of course it dipped 1500 soon after that.. but it rebounded.
Just buy and hold
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:16:44


Yes and yes
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:05
Understandable.. not saying it's impossible by any means.. but it also seems like a hell of a lot of work to pull something like that off. 
What about my cloud storage thought? If my phone has good security, my cloud storages, banks, and email are all set up with 2FA.. and I keep a copy of the key/seed in there or multiple places.. what things should I fear? No one knows my passwords.. I don't hand them out. No one uses my phone except me...
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:52:03
That’s one year from date of purchase of BTC to avoid the higher tax for short term game right? And he’d just pay capital gains? In USA anyway
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:54:18
You're telling me that you don't? Get a load of this guy...
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:19:28
Hey it's me, the IRS. I'll take my cut now
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:45:13
What about pics, images or a text file of the seed key saved to Dropbox or other cloud storage with 2 factor authentication.. or on your phone? Phones are fairly secure, IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:08
Also in Philly at their penitentiary. :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:21
Which is the 1 year mark of purchase, yes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:46:55
Yeah, we all sign that when we drive into Florida. You bitches are crazy...
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:37:58
What type of private insurance company? One that would insure your BTC in case of theft or a hack?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:48
Best thing is to overshoot it.. save 50% of your gains for example though knowing the tax you'll owe will be &lt;50%.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:57:08
They're reporting only 14,000+ users who made buys/sells of $20k or more between 2013-2015.
That's not to say they won't want another alotment of usernames to hunt down and fine/jail in the future though too

And i feel I would be "low on the totem pole" per se as I do my best to lock down all of my accounts and don't provide others use to my phone or PC.. especially anyone worthy of knowing what to do or how to do it to obtain my BTC. But i hear ya! Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:48
Except on Pizza tuesdays
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:14:38
Yes, true.

Let me see that tootsie roll
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:44:33
Just an FYI for you and others, in the US the IRS wanted 14,000+ names from Coinbase for anyone who cashed out over ... $20k I believe in BTC between 2013-2015 if i remember right.. so yes, they do have that info and will provide it to the IRS at their request...
And yes, the government will want a more than generous portion of your own damn money, just like everything else.
Moral of the story... don't cash out until BTC hits $1b because then you'll have **FUCK YOU** money.
EDIT: [Found the source for all my claims](
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:40:12
Not sure whether to applaud you for getting her dad to come out, or the fact that you had sex with him within an hour...
EDIT: Bummer.. OP deleted his account. Context is lost :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:56
Nah, only if devices are jailbroken and you're downloading shady apps. And apple pulled all of their malware/virus detection apps because they don't do anything and there's no need to have them cause their ecosystem is so strong. Android is more prone to that stuff, but it's still rare.
Sure people can guess your password hints or look them up if they're online.. but unlikely that would happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:13:33
Any examples?
Whether you buy services, goods, or just cash out BTC... it's still a gain and taxable as a gain. If you buy a $2000 junker, then sell it, the $2000 is still 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:51:51
I did... to ask you for examples ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:27:03
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:46:14
Exactly. It's not until you physically have the cash that you need to report and pay taxes. Similar to owning a house.. and it goes up in value $50,000.. you don't need to pay tax on it until you sell the asset for a gain.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:02:00
Student loan? Most likely not without a cosigner with awesome credit..
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:06
I believe the loss can be written off If i read some where correctly..
Also.. capital gains are only after a year.. if you invest and pull out gains within 1 year, it gets the income tax (which is higher than capital gains) I believe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:34:58


So basically.. student loans with a nice rate :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:11
[Yes, according to questions asked on Amazon.](
Seems simple.. guy tested it too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:03:23
2-40% return on BTC.. 3% loan.. i'd say it's not a bad idea... i mean I'm still paying my student loans back and will forever and have nothing to show for it. If BTC tanks and OP is out thousands of dollars.. he and I will be in the same boat almost except my rates are 6%+ :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:50:43
*unzips slowly*
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:14:03
Not sure why the downvotes.. I cant even get my tech savvy friends to understand what bitcoin is or how to buy any.
I help my 50+ year old parents (among a number of my elderly coworkers) with checking their emails frequently. This is the exact demographic that I feel doesn't care to understand and shouldn't necessarily be a target for bitcoin since they're just getting rid of their flip phones not by choice.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:44:03
*Shame. Shame. Shame.*

You've read, and understood, correctly.
