Why would I want to live anywhere else? Are you assuming I'm a minority just because I don't see discrimination against us white dudes where there isn't any? And even if I were instead a minority, why would I want to?

The government totally sucks, you motherfucker.

I'll smash two old nontouch ipods, if it'll get me something. Maybe a red bumper case for my existing n5?

You can't "have" someone's wallet without their private key. An address without a private key is just an address, which anyone can observe in the block chain.
I haven't read up on this in any great detail lately, but he likely had his own personal address, with its own private key, stored on his own computer.(likely, hopefully encrypted). Address used on the server for the running of SR would likely have their own respective private keys stored on the server, which was captured. But his own personal one was/is likely completely separate.

Yup. Rescan=false is invaluable. I had an op going involving 1000+ addresses. I shudder to think what I would have done without it.

Because if you're like me, and you rig up a captcha reader for a certain faucet with a weak captcha, and hit that single faucet 500+ times an hour ever hour for days on end, with 1000 different wallets, with individual nodes "sleeping" to simulate real sleep cycles, all funneling back together after some tumbling, it adds up quickly.
ER, that's totally hypothetical, of course. &gt;_&gt;
And if it weren't hypothetical, that site changed to google captchas. So about 1.5 bitcoins is all I got.

It's funny cause people are pissing their BTC away on reddit gold.

I took 5 minutes and did it right in inkscape, if anyone cares:
[16384x16384 raster]( "...ignore the domain, i own some weird ones")
[Vector, as an svg]( "...ignore the domain, i own some weird ones")
Step 1. borrow the "B" from the official bitcoin SVGs (it's the exact same)
Step 2. unrotate it and add a shadow/embossy thing behind it
Step 3. Add circles.
Step 4. save and export.

I can't wait to see how much my 0.01 BTC is worth in a few years.

I've been trying to tell myself to buy it for years but oh wait I'm too poor to even get started.

I'm so scared. My privilege. Oh help, help!

I'm downvoting this entire post just to give wackjob loonies like you less of a platform.

As a white male, please, cry me a river and tell me a once-upon-a-time tale over our fictional persecution, you poor unfortunate persecuted soul.

I was churning out a bunch of 1Fuck addresses, and got it. Not using it as my primary though, yet

Why thank you, good sir. My mistake for doubting your intent, I'd figured you were just being trolly. =]
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:21:13
I got 1Fuckwads after only about 2 hours of running it. Did a search for Fuck, got Fuckwads

Using a website at all to generate an address/secret pair would be risky, imho. I just run mickey to generate all mine. Or vanitygen if I'm doing something I'll use directly.
