Obviously, there are grey areas. Buying Tesla in the hope it doubles in a year is mostly speculation - but an investor would maybe also buy Tesla for their ground-breaking tech, their sales, the perspective of dividends later on.
As far as Bitcoin is concerned, it's not what I call an investment - there's no company, no product, no sales, hardly bleeding-edge tech (LN may or may not be that). It's a store of value in the best case, like gold. I don't consider gold an investment either.
I am not opposed to speculating on Bitcoin, I bought my first ones in 2013. I just think his family has a point and he is a bit too carried away - after all, he is putting money his family saved over years into BTC. This might work or backfire royally.

Just tell them you are aware you are not investing but speculating. You only took a little of your money to entertain yourself and maybe reap some gains.
After all, that's the truth, right?

It's OK, that's where Monero, Dash et al are now. Bitcoin has been eaten up by big money and all that remains are two corporate zombies.

Bullshit. From summer on, BTC has been clogged on and off again. Wildly varying tx fees. ETH was also slow (like in: 20min), but they got their shit together.
Please tell my why you would pay such high fees and wait forever voluntarily?

The clogged mempool on BTC and the broken DAA on BCH were very profitable. I hope the two development teams carry on with their relative strengths: Core, don't even think about going for a reasonable block size increase. ABC, please stick to testing code in production.
I'd really hate to see the volatility disappear because people come to their senses...
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:08:55
Exactly, it is only a question of time till BCC implodes.

Wow, there is hardly anything better to represent how toxic the bitcoin community has become.  It seems both subreddits are full or retards at that point.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:00:49
Why not just buy some Monero and store them? They cannot be traced.

Meh, as if liking blowjobs and visiting prostitutes was an uncommon character flaw. 
Cheap, cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:36:21
Yeah, don't disturb by pointing out the obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:48:50
Yeah, it's not like the devs have anything to do with that. Funny how other cryptos are way less religious and more pragmatic about scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:07:34
I have stopped using BTC for transfers. ETH typically takes me about 2min, DASH is even faster. It's not longer funny waiting 90+min and pay $5+ for it.

I vividly remember December, 2013, the reckoning of the "long-term investor", as HODLers were called back then. The party was so drunk that it took 3y to get rid of the headache.
This time, it's going to be pure beauty - a coinmaggadon where people of all walks of life see their purchasing power melt down by 80% over years. They will clench their butt-cheeks and bite their fists, but they will HODL!
Meanwhile, those smarter than you and I will have sold most, and therefore suffer only small losses and make those up in short time. And after that, be filthy rich.

Where do I get tamper-evident envelopes? I already bought sealing wax and a unique stamp, but it seems anyone with at least half a brain could tamper with the envelope.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:51:35
Thanks for telling me!
I have been in crypto since 4 years and have seen a couple of ponzies come and go. When it smells like a ponzi and tastes like a ponzi, it is one. Good luck fleecing those poor people who believe in your fucking lies.

Let's undermine security because reasons...

I will just continue using € and ct, never change a working system. Bitcoin will reside on my Trezor in case I need money to spend. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:57:05


LOL, I am sure people will lend out money to receive less money to foster their social network. Please wake up.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:54:04
That's only true if economic growth drops to zero.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:51:41
Wait, why would I lend out large sums if I get only a small compensation that is not proportional to the amount I lend out?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:48:02
See, that's why we have inflation in the real world instead of deflation like with Bitcoin. In a deflationary world, as you just pointed out, no one in their right minds would take out a loan. You would live a very frugal life and late in life would move out from your parents and buy a house/flat with the BTC you saved over decades. Or simply wait for your parents to die and inherit their property.
Of course, that would lead to the demise of a lot of industries and end us in a high-tech middle age where loans are hardly affordable and most of the production is centered around the bare necessities of life. 
BTC was created by technological geniusses which at the same time were complete economical morons.

That basically means two things:
1) Second-round effects will devastate the economy. If people spend less, then companies earn less, then they fire employees to stay afloat. Those unemployed spend less and companies earn even less. Until a new equilibrium is established that makes everyone poorer. 
2) the only worthwhile loans will be for development that either bring something to market that blows the competition out of the water or cuts costs. The first is rare and for the second, see 1)
Inflation is absolutely vital for loans as it punishes hodlers and rewards those who inject their money back into the economy (via the interest they receive). Take away inflation and everyone turns into a hodler hoping for their neighbors to foot the bill. This is what we've seen in BTC since about 2013. When people became aware that their purchase of a bit of weed last year was a dumb idea and they should have kept the coins, buying stuff with BTC fell off a cliff.
I really cannot see how we would maintain our standard of living in a BTC-economy. Surely, you know the imaginary warning written in 2013 from some time-traveler? It's a bit over the top, but in essence is very true.

That may be your opinion, but [empirical macro-economy]( begs to differ: 




Apple very specifically hardly ever lowers the price of the flagship phones over the year they are the flagship. They get simply superseded after a year and *may* live on at a reduced price after 12m - but many simply get discontinued. They do this to entice users to buy the latest phone, of course and not wait for price reductions. 


It's the other way around, economic output aligns with deflation rate for obvious reasons of insane CapEx in a deflationary environment and customer expenditure moderation. 


BTC is a prototype that escaped the lab - even with LN, it is utterly unfit for a world currency. And I say this as a BTC hodler of 5 years. While I admire the technological prowess of the creators, it doesn't diminish their genius to state that a full P2P system cannot ever hope to achieve the tx count necessary - Gen 3++ cryptos using DAG's or tiered validator nodes may, but with BTC's PoW and structure, it is simply hopeless.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:02:23
Negative interest rates for fiat drove a lot of people into crypto in the first place. And with "be your own bank", that would simply collapse the market for savings accounts and encourage even more hoarding.

Depends, if he pays the exchange the usual $10k - $100k, they will probably list it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:08:04
That's not too bad. A carrier pigeon would have been faster and cheaper, but there's a price to be paid for progress.

Does it make sense to clone the existing blockchain folder on disk and run both a vanilla bitcoin-core node and a bip148 node in parallel for some weeks in August? Bandwidth would not be a limiting factor.
