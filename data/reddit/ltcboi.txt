didn’t report and I don’t give a fuck. Good lesson for the goodie-goodie liberals here. Government is not your friend. Gov’s just giving your money away to deadbeats, Iran, Israel, and wealthy corporations. Don’t even start with “muh roads and public goods.” 
I already pay out at the ass being self-employed. I’ll be goddamned if I hand over my crypto profits to some parasite. 
Always transfer to private wallets and sell for fiat using private markets for plausible deniability.

You obviously have never been self-employed and been on the line between getting hundreds (or thousands) in free credit gibs, and paying out the ass to give those gibs to all the poor single mothers.

First it block wikileaks, then it blocks other non-profits, then it blocks select private anonymous addresses, then...
Maybe you can see where this is going

It’s about finding the inflection points to make an educated decision whether you should buy, sell, or hold. Not about exact timing of the market and being 100% correct.

But dude, like, the gubmint is just doing what is best for us. They promise.

I bet Coinbase isn’t blocking known DNM addresses. They’d probably lose way too much in sweet, sweet TX fees.

And yet you love the unwashed coward that is Bradley Manning, who helped propel Wikileaks to its current status, no doubt.

I’m sure you feel the same about uninvited invaders from the south.

This guy is obviously more woke than the rest of us. So woke.

10 years ago the same people that were with her in 2016 and hate Trump today absolutely loved Wikileaks during the Bush years. �� 
Assange is just doing what Assange does...trolling govs and corps.
