You're wrong, jackass.

Hi Dainis.
Let's at least educate other people on how you got scammed. Please tell us exactly how you opened this blockchain wallet in the first place (what day/time, whether you did it alone or with assistance, process for opening) and give us a good sequence of events (without watching a two hour video) for how this took place, we'll tell you exactly how you lost this money. Also, if you want detail around these events please provide the **public** address of your wallet.
I implore you to do more research before putting any more money into Bitcoin. You bought something that you have no knowledge about and got scammed, simply put. There are an insane number of resources available for learning about Bitcoin, use them.

Let me ask you: if you didn't believe the "2-3x return promise" why did you give a stranger access to your account in the first place? You believed him and you were being greedy and lazy. Let's be clear, you don't have "non-spendable" BTC (something that doesn't exist), you don't have any BTC *at all*.
To your credit, it looked like you had already lost your BTC when you first logged into the account on the stream. There's a chance you lost it to malware before Benjamin had a chance to take it, I don't know, but it's sure as hell gone now.
Others are telling you to take this as a "lesson". You have to accept the fact that you made a mistake in order to learn a lesson. 
Also, don't beat yourself up too much I guess, I've lost much (1000x) more than you have.

I think you funded a gang, the guy sounds American to me. It looks like the first time you logged in you had already lost it (sent 0.018..). Pretty dumb dude, no idea what you were thinking. 


You might be medically stupid, talk to your doctor.

Depends on who you ask. I bought my first full Bitcoin last week at $5500 - not unhappy with that decision this morning. Most people think Bitcoin will see $10k before the end of the year with an upper limit of $50k-$100k (depending on who you're talking to).
One thing is for sure, the price will definitely go up or down!

Sounds like we went through different processes. Sorry, no idea. Try - I will tell you that their support is incredibly bad, according to reports... If the lockout time is lower than one week you might be better off just waiting.

I think you have to apply logic to their question, I had a number of withdrawals/deposits as well. Mine asked for deposits within a certain $ range.

It is a bad idea and he is a retard. You can't afford to lose 1/3rd of your savings regardless of who you are. A homeless man who loses $1 when he has $3 is going to be pissed.
Trust me, when the price falls and starts to approach his buy-in again he'll start to panic. I started with about the same amount of my savings and the past six months have taken years from me. There's no such thing as being young enough to see 1/3rd of your wealth vanish without giving a shit.

Can you really handle that amount of stress? Do you really want to have persuaded your wife into this if it all goes sideways tomorrow? This is a bad idea, awful.
