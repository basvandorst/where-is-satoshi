yes, if the transaction happens immediately that's fine, although I expect anything to happen.. not sure if a crash is possible, like.. in minutes you go from $400 to $1 per bitcoin... that would be interesting..
anyway I wouldn't keep bitcoins in my wallet unless I'm willing to lose them.

geez? are you kidding me? bitcoins are the most dangerous form of 'money' anywhere. today a bitcoin is 400$ tomorrow it could be 800 or 10 dollars. it's mind blowing how unstable and risky this is. I don't think anyone should use bitcoin to BUY things, bitcoin is just for risky investments, for people willing taking this crazy risk. you can win big or lose big.

thanks guys! I thought the wallet is something always handled by a third party, like a bank.. except providing zero credibility haha.. so the only way to have your local wallet stolen, if it's on your pc, is via phishing? meaning it's up to you not to do anything stupid? I'll do some more readin'. thanks for the links and all.

ok, why do people still buy bitcoin after mt gox disappeared and so many people lost their money over night? did anyone get their money back? or the creators of mt gox just grabbed everything and are now living happily in Hawaii.. with a personal aircraft carrier and everything.
to me it looks like the real issue with bitcoin is not the risk in the wild fluctuations.. but that your wallet can stop to exist anytime, when the nameless business you trusted for some reason.. decides to take off. am I missing something very important here?..
