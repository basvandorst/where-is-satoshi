yeah, I also only realised later you mentioned increasing dbcache. Mine was at default. I changed it and seems to be going faster now. Thanks!

I don't think you are helping with this attitude. Basically what I hear you say is:
"stopping spending or buying anything and only buy things you can buy directly with bitcoin. Or don't support any BTC-backed solution, prefer instead pure fiat-backed solutions until bitcoin takes place magically everywhere".
I have been a bitcoin supporter for a long time and basically the places I could use bitcoin directly were on Xotika and for donations. I have, however, being able to pay for a lot of stuff by having a debit card that stores my balance in BTC.
I would love to see things priced in BTC and ability to pay directly with it. But we are not there yet and refusing intermediary solutions is not going to take us anywhere. Not everyone is ready to 'stop spending money and wait until bitcoin can be spent everywhere.'

How can we be sure that reddit pgp_keys are good? I see that there was some edits to the page 5 days ago.

Do you folks know a trustable docker image that I can run a full node on? I keep reinstalling my OS and dual booting, so I would like to be able to just spin docker with bitcoind running a full node.
Sorry to hijack the thread.

Not fast for me. Downloaded 0.13.0 on Aug 23th. It is running 24h since then, on a i7 4790k running OSX, with 60Mib internet and is still at 80%. Syncing from Brazil.

Also have Xapo, I think from Jan/2016. It has chip. It has excellent USD Rate. I tried using on Brazilian fiat but rate was not great.

Anyone know a safe alternative? I've used their service to charge in USD and get in BTC, it was awesome to receive money from abroad since Paypal gets a high cut (7%) for this kind of transaction.

The website says it supports AltCoins. Is it able to hold multiple cryptocurrencies concurrently or I should only choose a single cryptocurrency at setup time?
@_date: 2016-06-10 01:26:35
This is probably the correct answer!

Yeah, it is hard to tell if he is trying to make his comments irrelevant on purpose or he just lacks real world awareness. Either way his posts are always spamming.

Quick translation:
She was taken while dropping kids at school. Taken in car to another state. Kidnappers contacted husband and demanded BTC. He contacted police then started negotiating with them to gain time. Police found captivity site before payment made. She is unharmed.

Well, the problem that Coinvoice solved to me was being able to charge in US, get paid BTC. I cannot charge directly in BTC since the company I doing contract for doesn't want to need to buy BTCs in order to pay me. So, these two solutions don't really help. thanks anyway.

Definitely recommend it. I have been using it for more than a year now. Not only I avoid the 7% PayPal fee but I also get a fair exchange rate.

So, my POV is that every little use case that involves bitcoin is a positive thing. Might be not exciting, but the more things that use it, bigger the feeling that you can trust/use bitcoin.

I get paid via bitwage, since my company won't do bitcoins. I keep the bitcoins and convert to fiat as I need it. There are really few places where I can spend BTC directly in Brazil. With a visa debit card, I get to keep my btcs and only convert to fiat as needed. Of course I am trilled at every place that accepts bitcoin directly, but having the ability to use it now has enabled me, for instance, to cancel my 'regular' visa credit card.
I disagree that these solutions set bitcoin growth back. What sets it back is when my friends ask me what can be bought with bitcoin and I have to say: "directly, pretty much nothing.".
