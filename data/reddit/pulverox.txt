This sounds like a really good way for that "free electricity" policy to be done away with, screwing all of the other students who *aren't* mining in their apartments.

Part of me fuckin loves this outlook. Part of me wants to defend the dumbasses, too, though.

Right on. Looks like they hiked up the miner fee to account for demand. Thank you.

If I sell my BCH on GDAX right now (unfortunately that's the only exchange I can use today), it doesn't affect my BTC at all, right? I seem to remember someone explaining that the keys between the two were linked, or something. So people were trying to sell 1 BCH, but accidentally ended up sending the buyer 1 BCH  *and* 1 BTC because of this issue.

Man, I'd love to say this is a no-brainer, but I saw a guy lose thousands the other day on a misclick. Cheers for the reminder.

Did you pay a big miner fee for that? It looks like they're asking for .003, which is pretty high, relative to the amount of amount of BCH I'd be depositing.

I also have a small wager on Trump. Booked months ago. Also should be mentioned that I don't support him.

Cool. I will let them know. Thank you.

Really? You don't have to verify your ID and stuff over the course of a few days? I don't remember how long it took when I did it.

Any sites where one can set up an account and then buy BTC the same day? Maybe on credit, or something? It's a long shot, but I have a few buddies who want to jump on the currently 8%~ dip before that Big Ban Theory episode tonight. Thanks for the help, folks.

If you clicked the link, it mentioned that's it's a "humorous adage" and not always literally true.

But... it's just a joke. I don't see a reason for the hostility.

Too many times in my life, I've been afraid to ask stupid questions, so I'm trying to avoid that happening again. Does this mean that I'm getting a free coin (albeit possibly worthless) for each BTC that I have stored on Coinbase, just for having it on there? I really do not know how this works, for the most part.
