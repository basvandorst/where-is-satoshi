Of course it wouldn't be possible. The total amount of currency on issue worldwide is a small fraction of the total global money supply.
You seem to be thinking of currency and money as if they are the same thing. Not every financial transaction needs to be matched with a physical unit of currency moving from A to B.

Thank you for your kind words of support during this difficult time. It's become apparent to me that my ass pizza joke was perhaps too subtle, too edgy or too soon and I have paid the price for my temerity. 
Thankfully I am surrounded by supportive people (including your good self) and am being counselled through this period of loss. My 47 down votes were like surrogate children to me. It's difficult to comprehend the suffering that has been inflicted on me - when I woke this morning and looked at my profile I let out a plaintive cry and collapsed, crying, rolling about and pounding my fists futilely on the cold and bitter ground. 
However there is a ray of light peeking out from the smelly, dirty sky of this evil day. And it shines from you.
It is because of you that I was able to pick myself up, steady my shaking hands and quivering lips and slowly begin the painful journey of moving forward with the rest of my life, irrevocably changed as it may be.
So please accept my sincere thanks and also the only thing I have to give, paltry and shallow as it may be. This humble upvote is yours my friend. 
Sincerely,

Yes, it seems to have moved beyond purely rational debate to politics, ideology supported by propaganda.

Ah my apologies, I misunderstood :) The whole thing is a mess to be honest. I actually have no direct stake, I have no coins so the result of the schism won't be immediately relevant to me. From what I can understand though, the dirty tricks go both ways. Coindesk is under sustained DDOS as we speak apparently...
I guess my main point is that the technical arguments, irrespective of their merits, will probably never be enough to overcome human sentiment. We in the unwashed masses might be wrong, but there are many of us. 
The upside (of sorts) of centralisation is central management and control, which can lead to stability. Some might call that market manipulation and they'd be right, but bankers have a rational self interest as well, which more often than not aligns with the bulk interests of their clients.
We used to see the irrational human behaviour in effect with fiat currency as well, runs on banks and the like, but those days seem to be gone as a result of centralised control, except as a consequence (but not a cause) of damaged economies. Not that I am advocating for fiat and banks, I have problems with the established system too. I know too many bankers to be comfortable trusting them.
I'd genuinely like to see bitcoin succeed, if nothing else it is something new, it adds a new dimension. And the genie is out of the bottle in many ways, if not bitcoin then something will fill its role. 
I hope it gets past these growing pains but I suspect that, longer term, part of that growth will result in it looking more like those centralised fiat currencies that it's intended to supplant...
On the topic, they seem as vociferous in defence of their position, technically and economically, as the people here in - rightly or wrongly. From the outside, the rights and the wrongs of each case don't seem as apparent as you might think. What I do see in common though is a charismatic few influencing the plebeian masses, characteristic of human nature in almost all realms, again for better or worse but almost immutable.
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:23:04
Friend, it is you that seems obsessed.
You claim that you don't care whether anyone believes that you are Satoshi. That's fantastic. Indeed, why should you care?
Yet then you go on these long winded, steam-of-consciousness rants, *sans* paragraphs, insisting that you really *really REALLY* are Satoshi, just that your well-known key doesn't work and would we please accept this other, totally irrelevant key instead?
You claim that you don't need my acceptance, and you know what - you are right, why should you?
I am just some random person from the internet, far away from you, likely we will never meet or interact in any meaningful fashion. I have no bitcoin, I'm unlikely to want to own any bitcoin soon. To be quite honest, I am unconvinced of bitcoin's longer-term future, despite being a vaguely interesting technology. I just have a idle curiosity regarding the culture that surrounds it.
So why are you, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, wasting time in discussion with me?
True, I know that nobody else on reddit is talking to you. Nobody else is providing any feedback whatsoever about your great idea. It's not as if you have anything else to do here at the moment so I am happy to fill the void.
You say I am a troll. Trolls on reddit are often identified by their karma scores. If we were to use that as a metric then it is you that is the troll, given that your karma is edging steadily backwards. In fact, I question whether I am actually being trolled by you but eh, it's one way to fill in my spare time.
Yet *you* call *me* a troll because I challenge your unproven claim and ask for evidence, which you are unable to provide. That's fairly pathetic.
It is not unreasonable to ask people making large claims to provide evidence. As Marcello Truzzi said, an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof. Not only are you not providing extraordinary proof, you are providing no proof at all.
You claim that I am a bad analyst (actually I am no kind of analyst, bad, good or indifferent), but your insistence that I accept your claim with no -zero - supporting evidence makes you a bad scientist.
Not to mention the silly *ad-hominem* attacks that you throw at me. To you, I am a teenager; I am not a coder; I don't read what you write; I think you should be like Neo, or Zeus; I should go to university; I can't interpret your high-minded wisdom; I am a child who should be watching Disney.
It seems beneath you, the self-professed "Satoshi Nakamoto", to sink to such depths. If you wish to pass yourself off as Satoshi then you should at least learn to feign an appropriate level of gravitas and maturity. You have a reputation to uphold! Someone else's reputation, true, but nonetheless. Have some standards. You aren't even a good fake Satoshi so far.
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:28:08
Mate, I'm not trolling. But this is reddit, I can post anything I like on your thread as long as it complies with the site's TOS. There is no requirement to stay on topic.
The mods call the shots in their subreddit however, if you report me and they censure me / delete my comments / block me then I would naturally respect their decision. 
I suspect you probably have a mental illness to be honest. It's one thing to claim to be Satoshi, plenty of people do that. But to be so insistent, with zero supporting evidence, starts to feel like a delusion to me.


The ning account that that message was posted on has been hacked, as have some of his other accounts. [See here]( (although if you actually were Satoshi you would already know this given it seems to have been hacked in March 2014). 


That account has not been closed, it still exists as of today and [has had another message posted on it since the Dorian Nakamoto message.]( Did you post that other message?

You provide no proof of your identity, yet claim to somebody of note. The onus is on you to demonstrate who you claim to be, not on me or anyone else to disprove it. You get belligerent when challenged but still post no evidence. You try to pull some fake "other key" scam. You make a mistake about an account you supposedly own and have to backpedal when called on your blunder. The hackers did not try to impersonate "you", except in the message that you just claimed to have posted. The other message was a warning and clearly not from Satoshi. 
You want unquestioning respect from me. You've done nothing to earn it. You whine about being insulted. You are a bit too precious to be on the internet I think. 
As for my handle, it comes from the days when we only had eight characters for that sort of thing. I said I was not a coder, not that I can't code. I find coding dull beyond belief and would only do it under sufferance these days. Coding isn't some magically elevated talented gifted by the gods anyway. It's just a skill learned by training and application, like all other skills.
Anyway, this conversation is becoming tedious. You have no evidence to prove your claim so you can be dismissed as a liar, fraud or a fabulist - or as I said, delusional. 
You are not Satoshi, just another lying claimant to his modest fame and history. If you have any respect for him at all then you should be ashamed. 
Even the "brilliant idea" that you've offered is sophomoric and scarcely worthy of examination. Hence you note that nobody except myself is even bothering to engage with you. Now THAT must feel disrespectful...

How do you foresee bitcoin overcoming the scalability issues that would allow transactions to occur on the scale required to support his idea?

Yes I know, but only after months of stalling and calls to action. And you can see in this thread the mentality of core developers like u/nullc. They still seem clueless regarding the political and diplomatic subtleties in something like this.
They seem to view themselves as masters of bitcoin rather than custodians. That attitude can be extremely disconcerting to potential purchasers. Hence the present rush to classic, it isn't because it's a better technical solution, it is a reaction against the people presently in charge. Not every problem has a technical cause or solution.
But let's be honest, it isn't the interests of average bitcoin hodlers that motivate people in core or in classic. It's techno-dickschwing points, and the need to exert control.

Welcome to reddit :) In what is an uncanny coincidence, your month-old username is an anagram or nonadjacent metathesis of u/junseth, a regular poster to this sub and various other bitcoin-related subs.
It's easy to characterise people who disagree with you as stupid. I'd be willing to bet that the distribution of intellect on both sides of the debate is roughly equal, and spans roughly the same range, not that there's be any reliable means of testing that hypothesis.
However you might want to challenge or test your own assumption that bitcoin classic proponents are somehow stupider than bitcoin core proponents. That mode of thinking is typically adopted by people who are susceptible to dogma rather than capable of true critical thought. And I'm optimistic in assuming that you are capable of applying true critical thought.

Friend, I am no coder so I can't be any practical help to you. But a few comments:
Nobody will accept that you are Satoshi without evidence. You may as well claim to be the reincarnation of Elvis Presley. Plenty of others are vying for Satoshi's legacy, without evidence you are just another nutty claimant. Personally, I don't make decisions without evidence so I will keep an open mind but I think it is fair to be sceptical.
I also have PGP keys from the mid-1990s, probably earlier than 1998 if that matters, although I have not used them for many years. I think I initialised my PGP keys around 1995-96. I was a little paranoid, I used 4096 bit keys even back then, even though 40-bit RC2/RC4 was still generally considered secure back then and 1024 bits was considered "overkill".
I am sure that plenty of others - like us - were smart enough to use strong encryption, including PGP, when needed back then. PGP has been around since the very early 1990's so it is not special to have old keys.
As for your language skills, I may have seen some of Satoshi's emails but I am not sure. I have read Satoshi's paper and the language is impeccable so your "ghost writer" did a great job if that was indeed the case.
As has been discussed many times, there are many ways for Satoshi to prove his identity. He/she could move some of the old coins from one wallet to another - so simple. No need to "fix" old and "lost" encryption keys, which is likely an impossible task. Of course, Satoshi would know all of this already so the fact that you haven't announced your "second coming" with a movement of primordial coins means that scepticism is very appropriate.
I'm sorry that you feel insulted by my glib comments but I hope you'd understand that people would be sceptical of your claims without impeccable proof, which the real Satoshi could easily supply.
Old PGP keys won't constitute proof without a definite and unarguable link to the "real" Satoshi Nakamoto. Best regards in your endeavour.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:13:39
But once we step down from the STEMlord high perch, we can acknowledge that users would like their transactions to process more quickly and reliably, and to have a clear and coherent framework for future development of the currency. 
And it's this that core have stymied through their inaction. So in a sense their technical competence is  more than offset by their lack of political, market and economic competence.
Technical whiz-bangerry is nothing without a market or economic reason to exist. This also should be clear without saying.

Nonetheless, it's not material to them. The relative value of crypto vs traditional banking economics makes it insignificant.
Banks don't rely on innovation except insofar as it allows them to draw customer funds from other banks. Banks rely on stability and trust - strangely enough, properties crypto seems to lack.
It's like a billionaire leaving a casino after blowing a lazy $20M on the baccarat table throwing his last $10K chip on number 17 on the roulette table on the way to his private jet. Nice if he wins, meaningless if he doesn't.

Yup. There seems to be large buy walls put in that are dropped when the price approaches them (fake walls), and matched buy/sell orders that trade back and forward to support a price.
You can often see the matched buy/sell orders of very similar size pop into existence either side of the current price, trade off and then exhaust. It seems cyclical and follows (in current environment) sustained price falls, resulting in the price stabilising or climbing for a period (pumping). Sized much greater than the otherwise prevailing trades so the price hovers there until the trade is completed at that price. Probably to give people time to set up a position to profit from a subsequent drop or pump.
Doesn't seem to be working effectively at the moment though, at least if the goal is to have a stable-ish price that can be moved both up and down. The price has run away a little at present.
I suspect it is a particular large, tether-heavy exchange doing it itself rather than individual whales. Or maybe whales collaborating with exchanges and/or exchanges trading with other exchanges. Or a bot with exchange backing, as often walls are put up and removed at multiple levels quite rapidly (seconds sometimes). All activities that are banned in proper regulated markets!

It's pretty straightforward. Let me give the layman's explanation.
To create revocable Commitment Transactions requires proper construc-
tion of the channel from the beginning, and only signing transactions which
may be broadcast at any time in the future, while ensuring that one will
not lose out due to uncooperative or malicious counterparties. This re-
quires determining which public key to use for new commitments, as us-
ing SIGHASH NOINPUT requires using unique keys for each Commitment
Transaction RSMC (and HTLC) output. We use P to designate pubkeys
and K to designate the corresponding private key used to sign.
When generating the first Commitment Transaction, Alice and Bob
agree to create a multisig output from a Funding Transaction with a single
multisig(PAliceF , PBobF ) output, funded with 0.5 BTC from Alice and Bob
for a total of 1 BTC. This output is a Pay to Script Hash[16] transaction,
which requires both Alice and Bob to both agree to spend from the Funding
Transaction. They do not yet make the Funding Transaction (F) spendable.
Additionally, PAliceF and PBobF are only used for the Funding Transaction,
they are not used for anything else.
Since the Delivery transaction is just a P2PKH output (bitcoin ad-
dresses beginning with 1) or P2SH transaction (commonly recognized as ad-
dresses beginning with the 3) which the counterparties designate beforehand,
this can be generated as an output of PAliceD and PBobD. For simplicity,
these output addresses will remain the same throughout the channel, since
its funds are fully controlled by its designated recipient after the Commit-
ment Transaction enters the blockchain. If desired, but not necessary, both
parties may update and change PAliceD and PBobD for future Commitment
Transactions.
Both parties exchange pubkeys they intend to use for the RSMC (and
HTLC described in future sections) for the Commitment Transaction. Each
set of Commitment Transactions use their own public keys and are not
ever reused. Both parties may already know all future pubkeys by using
a BIP 0032[17] HD Wallet construction by exchanging Master Public Keys
during channel construction. If they wish to generate a new Commitment
Transaction pair C2a/C2b, they use multisig(PAliceRSMC2, PBobRSMC2) for
the RSMC output. After both parties know the output values from the Commitment
Transactions, both parties create the pair of Commitment Transactions,
e.g. C2a/C2b, but do not exchange signatures for the Commitment Trans-
actions. They both sign the Revocable Delivery transaction (RD2a/RD2b)
and exchange the signatures. Bob signs RD1a and gives it to Alice
(using KBobRSMC2), while Alice signs RD1b and gives it to Bob (using
KAliceRSMC2).
When both parties have the Revocable Delivery transaction, they ex-
change signatures for the Commitment Transactions. Bob signs C1a using
KBobF and gives it to Alice, and Alice signs C1b using KAliceF and gives it
to Bob.
That's it in a nutshell, let me know if you have any questions.

You got in at 200 and you're angry that it's at 9000 now...how could you not be happy with that rate of growth?
At some point it goes beyond FOMO into pure greed...where do you think that line lies?

It'd be the easiest thing in the world for Bitfinex / tether to prove unequivocally that they have sufficient USD funds to back their tokens 1:1. It defies reason that they do not know, to the dollar, exactly how much funding they have and where it is. 
Companies have to provide that type of data routinely for many reasons, if not publicly then to their investors, their banks, the tax office, corporate regulators etc.
Imagine what it would do for market confidence if Bitfinex confirmed their balance sheet?
What possible benefit or reason would they have to conceal that data, particularly given the questions regarding their solvency?
Why have they severed their relationship with their auditor (or vice versa) - do you understand how unusual it is for that to happen? 
It's hardly just Bitfinex'ed asking the question, it is all through the press now.

You're missing the point. The facts exist. Tether / Bitfinex know the facts. I don't, you don't and the market doesn't. The market is plummeting because the facts aren't publicly known. 
They could fix this uncertainty tonight by releasing the facts. Why don't they do that?

He's saying that in his unregulated crypto paradise, an "insurer" will create a smart contract which pays a fee to have Alice killed, preventing her from polluting.
In his dream world "insurers" will be able to take *direct action with extreme prejudice* to mitigate their insured risks. It's game theoretic dontchaknow?

It didn't need to have been guessed or brute forced. They could have used social engineering on someone at gmx.com, weaknesses in the email server, leaked password hashes or a bunch of other things.
Or maybe an admin filched the account and then hid the traces. After all, satoshi had disappeared by then.

The main characteristic of meth psychosis is the presence of prominent hallucinations and delusions (APA, 1994). The diagnosis of methamphetamine psychosis is made after performing a thorough history, physical exam, urine drug screen, and "reality testing."
Clients who are psychotic will be unable to provide a history themselves, so this information will need to be obtained from significant others. The term ”spun” is used by the meth culture for a user who has overdosed on meth and induced a state of psychotic confusion. The user should be assessed for the following manifestations of psychosis:
Hallucinations: Hallucinations, or false perceptions, may be associated with any of the five senses.
Auditory: This is the false perception of sound and the most frequent type of hallucination. Most frequently the user "hears voices." Command hallucinations are “voices” that may issue commands for violence to others. For example, the user hears voices telling him to kill himself or others. Obviously, this places the user and/or health care professional in a potentially dangerous situation.
Visual: Seeing a person, object or animal that does not exist in the environment. For example, a user sees a lion coming toward him.
Olfactory: This is the false perception of smelling odors that are not present in the environment. For example, a user smells his "brain rotting."
Tactile: This is a false perception of the sense of touch, often of something on or under the skin. Formication (US Dept. of Justice, 1996) is an advanced form of methamphetamine hallucination during which the user feels bugs on his skin. The user scratches at the “bugs” trying to remove them, gouging the skin and leaving scars. These scars indicate that the user has experienced formication or “crank bugs."
Gustatory: A false perception of the sense of taste. For example, a user refuses to eat because he tastes poison in his food.
It is difficult to distinguish the hallucinations of schizophrenia from those of drug use. According to MacKenzie and Heischober (1997), the hallucinations of schizophrenia usually are auditory, whereas those for chronic methamphetamine use are more commonly visual or tactile. Kaplan and Sadock (1994) discuss the difference between paranoid schizophrenia and an amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder. An amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder includes a predominance of visual hallucinations, generally appropriate affect, hyperactivity, hypersexuality, confusion and incoherence and little evidence of disordered thinking. The affective flattening and alogia (inability to speak) of schizophrenia are generally absent in amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder. If the healthcare worker is uncertain about the cause of the hallucination, a urine drug screen should be obtained.
