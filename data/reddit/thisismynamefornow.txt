I will agree that a lot of organized Public Relations efforts appear to be underway on reddit. However that does not mean that everyone who disagrees with or pokes fun at a community is a paid agent.

You are quite an entertaining character.

You're right this would have been a great buttcoin post. We don't have an ad with a lantern but bring your sense of humor and come join us anyway.

Personally I'm not worried because I know Satoshi has a time machine. He will return in the future to warn us when it is time to change the cipher. Everyone thinks he never spent any coins but some of us know the truth. He started spending in 2069 when buttcoin hit $1,000,000.

I always thought Satoshi was behind it.

I remember you from the weed trimming AMA awhile ago. I really have no idea if you're being serious or sarcastic.

The Code Book by Simon Singh is an interesting read.

Its almost like a large majority find these solutions to be too awkward. Obviously there is something wrong with those people.

I was just kidding around. I write satire that will cause your readers to have fits.

I enjoy writing.

The case is well documented [here]( This [thread]( might also be of interest to you. [This site]( has a copy of the journal the thread references.

I'm not sure what the rumor is but one of the corrupt agents, [Shaun Bridges]( put together an affidavit for the seizure warrant of some mtgox funds back in 2013. Turns out, he wired out 800k of his own money a couple days before the seizure occurred. I'm too lazy to find the source but I also read it is believed by the FBI he had an accomplice or two that have not been caught yet. It popped up in a court document. Plenty of fodder for rumors I guess.
