I pay 1.9% to PayPal. Coinbase charges 1% to move from BTC to USD. (I need to move to USD to pay salaries, rent, suppliers, utilities, etc.) There is a difference but it is not significant enough to be a deciding factor in favor of BTC. The cost of managing the accounting of BTC payments is likely to be more than the 0.9% savings, actually.
I *am* preparing to accept BTC because I'm a tech geek at heart and crypto is something that has always interested me. I have no idea if it will make much difference to my bottom line or not but it should be fun if nothing else.

Most currency pairs don't move much (if at all) over weekends. Weekends start when the US markets close on Friday and end when the Japanese markets open on Monday.

Sydney is not a major exchange for FX trading.

Being unknown doesn't mean you can't do your best to plan for it. It certainly doesn't mean you should just ignore it and hope for the best.
The complete failure of AES would dwarf the problem of a few lost bitcoins. However much better password cracking systems could be developed that are faster than today's brute force. Mathematicians at work.


The actual quote was, "640K ought to be enough for anybody" which means exactly what I wrote above. (Gates, btw, insists he never said it.) The point is that what is sufficient today won't be sufficient tomorrow. We already *know* that, what sets us apart is how we plan for it.


It is not a matter of "if" but "when" 16 character passwords become insecure. When choosing encryption and passwords you have to consider how long you need to keep that data safe. Do you need to keep your bitcoins safe for a month? A year? 10 years? 50? Consider how much technology may change over that expected span of time and plan accordingly to the best of your ability.
Also important to remember that if someone has a copy of your wallet encrypted with your current password it does not matter if you change your password, they already have your wallet.
In the end, they're your bitcoins. Do what you feel is best to protect yours and I'll do what I feel is best to protect mine.

Because Bitcoins need to be moved back to local currency so the merchant can pay salaries, rent, electricity, Internet, etc, and buy more stock. There is generally a transaction fee for this and there is also considerable exchange rate risk.

It's a question of what costs more for the company from end to end. Right now that is Bitcoin, and it is likely to remain so until people can operate a business from end-to-end with Bitcoin.

Attacking a server is very different from attacking an encrypted wallet file which is what I would expect any serious attack to be.
When considering security I always consider the *worst case scenario* and work from that. When protecting substantial amounts of money (perhaps in the future even millions of dollars) that is completely untraceable if stolen I'll happily choose a 50 character random password over a 16 character one, especially since it's all stored in my password manager anyway.

16 characters is not a particularly strong password when you are using it to protect thousands of dollars of untraceable assets.

I don't have a math degree and yet I have no problem understanding that 100pts = $2 so something that is 800pts = $16.
I hope you didn't pay much for that math degree.

FX trading requires a counterparty to complete the trade. 
Counterparties are typically large banks or trading houses and they keep regular business hours based on their location. While in theory it is possible to make trades when there are no major counterparties open in practice it doesn't happen with any sort of major volume -- not enough to effect the rates. This is why the FX markets are considered closed during the periods I stated above.

Sincerely very happy for you man! I hope things continue to go your way. :)

China's urban population is [690 million people]( and their 24 largest cities have a [combined population of 80.4 million](
India's urban population is about 280 million people and their [20 largest cities]( have a combined population of 84.4 million.
Japan's [population living in cities that exceed 200,000 people]( totals to 67 million people. You would be hard pressed to find anyone in Japan (125 mil people) who hasn't at least visited a city once.
I haven't even touched on city populations in other areas of the world and already the three countries I did list have a combined total of people *living* in cities that is more than 2/3s of the US' *total* population.
Edit: Added last paragraph.

As managing partner of a company that does business across multiple currencies I guarantee you that our prices will always be tied to the currency we have to pay our bills in. Every company does this.
As for consumers, they usually calculate the prices they pay based on the way they earn their money. If you earn your income in USD you calculate back to USD to see how much something actually costs you. If you're paid in BTC then everything gets converted back to BTC.

Dwolla is more usable because setup is easy to understand and complete -- your mother could probably do it.
It's cheaper as there is no transaction fee for &lt;$10 transactions and fees are capped at 25 cents for transactions exceeding $10.

A few points:
1. Today's dedicated password cracking hardware will be surpassed in performance by mobile phones within a few years, as always happens.
2. More efficient methods of cracking passwords could be found at any time. Brute force being required is not necessarily always going to be the case. (It may not even be the case now, not all advancements get publicized, especially if it is far more profitable to not say anything.)
3. 640k should be enough for anyone.

No, it's cheaper for everything. [With Dwolla] there is no exchange rate risk and no transaction fee to move Bitcoins back to local currency so the merchant can buy stock, pay salaries, and pay other expenses like electricity, phone, Internet, etc.
Edit: Also, at 25 cents per transaction it is no longer an expense that is a big issue for any properly functioning merchant. If you're selling something for $20 and can't afford 25 cents to cover payment processing you're not going to be in business for long.
Edit: Added "With Dwolla" above for clarity.
