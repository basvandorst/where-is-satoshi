Shoot. I am running a [node]( on a 40GB VPS from CloudatCost (they're meh, but usable) and I'll have to look into dealing with increasing storage as well. I paid for a lifetime sub, so leaving for another provider would be a little wasteful on my end.

Good luck signing up and getting "verified". ACH/wire transfers still delayed from last year. Flakey customer service. Check out their Facebook to get a glimpse of the reviews:

Thanks for the link, I do have an unused Pi sitting around and I recently set up a full node at  following the various VPS guides out there, so this may be right up my alley. 
I remember reading that because of the limited hardware specs, you would have to get blockchain data on the Pi using the bootstrap.dat, otherwise it would max out its resources trying to grab blockchain data. I also wonder if running a full node 24/7 would wear out the SD card's read/write cycles.

Whoa, thanks!

Nice! I upgraded from a Dev1 to a Dev3. It feels like such a huge jump to a Big Dog just for +20GB, but I'll think about it when another decent upgrade coupon comes around. I emailed their support about just adding storage, but that's not an option. Only what's offered on the templates.

So to run one of these nodes, one of the requirements is that you need 1000 Darkcoins in the address/wallet of the node. If 1 DRK is about $2.38, that's over $2000 USD investment required to get a little more than $1/day in return.

That's probably being a bit optimistic. The amount of DRK the individual masternode earns goes down as more masternodes are available. However, it seems DRK block rewards don't get halved like Bitcoin, but instead go down 7% per year (please correct me if I am wrong, I am still a Darkcoin newbie). 
Not sure how long it'd take to make back your original $2000+ investment based on this.

That's about right. These are the stats from my node:

I am interested in this, too. Four cores and 1GB of RAM sound more promising as I think those were some of the main limiting factors of the previous gen. 
As for storage, has anyone set up a node with an external USB connected HDD/SDD? If that's a thing, I may have some extra drives laying around...

Thanks for the clarification!

Nice! I may need to switch to a node hosted at home soon, as I'm going to run out of space on my Cloud at Cost [node](

Chiming in for using Coinbase to acquire BTC. Easy to set up, easy to use. As for learning more about Bitcoin, KhanAcademy has a really good series of YouTube videos:
