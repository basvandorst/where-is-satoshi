@_date: 2018-03-28 08:11:46
Marco Coino find the cofee shop first . I give hard 10. I accept cryptocurency since 2 months and the only buyer was my mother. Made her registration in Coinbase and all the wallet things in it. She would be starving if the grocery store accepts only crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:14:43
We all find crypto world for very interesting for some reason . I would never be so much in anything else in my entire life. Should be a hit not a miss. The prize will rise.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:40:16
Yeah this is the case.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:48:44
Yeah my mom looks so natural trader.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:15:24
Can it be used in Bulgaria cant get my country on the list.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:09:31
Thanks a lot for advice. Have online store on Purse and openbazaar . Purse don’t accept delivery to Bulgaria yet. Trying fb online store nothing in there yet. Use to have host and domain on www but people from my country probably prefer to try first the clothing.

@_date: 2018-04-03 07:31:41
Okay I get it now ;)
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:09:39
Even it takes time to buy some when your banks debit card denying to buy any of crypto in Coinbase.
