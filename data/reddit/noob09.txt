I'm more concerned about China taking over all their main domestic Mining pools (which already account for over 50% of the total Bitcoin hashrate). The government doesn't need to spend 17.5bn, they can just seize all the Chinese mining pools.

Obvious advertising yet still valid points raised. ATMs provide a great financial bridge to Bitcoin/Crypto for those that are unbanked. I organize workshops for Latin Americans in Canada to learn about how to transfer money from Canada to Mexico (and Lat. A). ATMs whether we like it or not, are still the most effective way out there to do this. Fees started quite high (last year we'd see 8% fees), but now are seeing a drop to around 2%. Still not cheap, but quite an improvement.

The Bitcoin network is more powerful than the worlds top 500 supercomputers COMBINED: 
I'm not saying its impossible, but it would extremely extremely risky for any super power to put in so many resources just to hurt one cryptocurrency. Practically, it makes zero sense.
