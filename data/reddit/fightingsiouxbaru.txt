No they aren't. It's because the Fed minutes came out at 2pm ET today, and stocks surged after that. Gold is used as a hedge, when stocks and currencies go up generally the price of gold goes down. It was also announced today that the dollar grew significantly against the Yen, which also sent people from gold back into currency markets.

The money lost to market size in the Gox collapse was way different than $200 million going missing in the fiat world. That's such a microscopic portion of the market cap that it really isn't an interesting. Gox was interesting not only because they went under, but also because it crashed the price of bitcoin by like, what, 75% in a relatively short amount of time. This event, however, will have ZERO impact on the market.

Right. I'm delusional. I imagined bitcoin at $1200. And it's definitely not a fraction of that now. That pump and dump bubble was something I just imagined. Totally not a dump that dropped value by over 75%. That's totally normal for stable currencies. I'm the Crazy one. All the people saying bitcoin would be $10k end of this year totally aren't delusional though... It's just me.
Got it bro. Just put as much money as you can into bitcoin. I'm sure it won't end up being something you regret.

The US. I wasn't aware it wasn't as easy in other countries. But yeah in America, while you can't charge back ANYTHING, they are more than willing to help if you've been wronged. Hell I moved a few years ago and a previous cable/internet company kept charging me a year after I moved, I made the mistake of never noticing it. I had cancelled it when I moved but they kept charging me. Called Wells, told them to reverse the charges and that I had cancelled, they gave me all the money back within a couple hours, and all they asked for was documentation that I cancelled it so I sent them the cancellation letter and that was that.
I've had fraudelent charges before from stolen CC info, and normally my bank calls ME before I even notice it and asks, "Did you try to Western Union $500 from Dallas Texas?", "Nope, I'm sitting here in Minnesota", "All right, we'll refund the money, cancel the charges, and send you a new card", "Thanks!"
It's actually pretty surprising how well even "big" banks handle that kind of stuff. Wells Fargo gets a lot of shit but I've never had a single problem with them and never spent a dime I didn't want to spend.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:03:37


And people spending *decreases* the price because it creates more liquid coins from places like Bitpay and coinbase, and since they want to move them quickly they undercut everyone else, driving the price down. The more bitcoins get used, the more the price will plunge. This is great for the people who want it as a currency, and bad for the people that want "$10,000/coin" prices by next year.

Store of value, depending on when you bought in. If you bought in at $1200 it's certainly not a store of value, if you bought in at anything arout $320, then today, it's still not a store of value. Technically Enron stock was a store of value too if you bought and sold at the right times, doesn't mean it wasn't volatile and *lost* value for many people. Bitcoin is only a store of value for people who brought in below it's current price, and that changes daily. I would say it's too volatile to be a store of value personally.
It makes for a useful currency and solves a lot of issues, but I don't believe it to be a good investment or store of value. It's price a month, 6 months, or 6 years from now is anyone's guess.

Loans. Security. Investment management. Ease of access to funds. If bitcoin makes it big, you better believe there will still be banks issuing loans, offering interest gaining accounts, or accounts that hedge against volatility, there will be insured theft protection in case someone swipes your wallet, etc. Banks will still have plenty of services. Banks deal with currency, they don't give a fuck whether its dollars, yen, or bitcoins. They'll still have a variety of services they can offer and make money on.
What your asking could be applied to cash too. "Why do I need a bank when I have this mattress I can hide my money under?"
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:29:17


Other than idealists, libertarians, and anarchists, the bitcoin currency really doesn't offer the average person any benefits over using their card or cash. In a lot of cases, it's actually more complex, harder to get into, harder to spend, less safe, and is accepted at a tiny tiny *tiny* fraction of places their card or fiat cash is.
Remittance and sending others large sums of money is about the only selling point, but not everyone needs that or does that. Not to mention there are plenty of services coming out and that are out that can do that with people's fiat just as easily.
So you have to ask yourself; what benefits does BTC offer to the average person that they don't currently have? And you have to leave out all the idealistic garbage like "fuck the banks", "BTC will bring down the governments", "BTC will change the world" type stuff. That means *nothing* to the average person who isn't a teenager.
What's keeping bitcoin from growing exponentially is it really doesn't offer the average person any reason to get on board.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:59:04


No, with services like BitPay it's an entirely risk free way to give people a different option to pay, possibly attract some new customers, and still make fiat just like they always have. It's not a future strategy, it's just another way that people can pay them. Simple as that. It's not surprising they are willing to take peoples money via a different method.


They aren't libertarian idealists over at MSFT, they are a publicly traded company that produces technologies and software. They will NOT hold BTC. Why? Because they aren't a bank nor an ivnestment firm. By holding BTC they are opening themselves up to investor scrutiny as they would have to disclose that in their annual reports. When people get word that MSFT is gambling with a significant chunk of it's earnings on a volatile asset like bitcoin, that would hurt their stock. Guaranteed. Why? Because their investors don't give a fuck about BTC, they care about their stock, and their stock is in a company that produces technologies and software, not speculates on crypto currencies.
So no, I beg to differ. You'll never see a company like that hold BTC. It's because it goes against the industry they are in. Companies like that do not give a fuck about ideals, principles, or some dream of a "future currency". They have a bottom line, and they will take cash, because that's what they need to keep their business growing and moving forward.


You buy points with your Visa card and get so many points in lump sums at a time. You don't buy 75 cents worth of items direct to card in numerous transactions, you buy a chunk of microsoft points for their market and spend out of that. Even with BTC it will still be the same and you'll just be buying chunks of points with BTC instead of a card. BTC won't change that, because MSFT wants people to buy a bunch of points, more than they might use. That's the idea of it. It's like when you go to the state fair or some food event and have to use tickets and can't pay the vendors directly. This way you go buy a sheet of 12 tickets for $10, and then you see everything costs 7 tickets. You either buy one item and sit on your tickets, or buy more tickets. The MSFT store is built on this same and well known principle. They want you to buy their points so that you have more than you need and use them more, bringing you back. There is no direct $-&gt;purchase in the LIVE market right now, and Bitcoin won't change that strategy.

Unless monopoly bucks are tied to the value of fiat, OR, the products being produced are created in countries where the inflating fiat is the standard currency. Both of these issues apply to bitcoin.
If you have a BTC, and I have $250, and the value of my dollars goes down because of inflation, and something that once cost $250 now costs $300 for me, you better believe it's going to cost more in BTC as well even if BTC supply remained steady and did not increase or decrease. Would you deny that's true? Are you suggesting the buying power of Bitcoin has *zero* ties to fiat markets? Because I don't think that's true at all.

It's a great price if you think the price will rebound. It's a bad price if you think it will plunge into double digits. No one here knows. Could go up could go down. Either way it's a risky venture. The majority of the comments here will tell you to buy. But keep in mind lots of people are down money here and have a vested interest in getting other people to buy in to help the price go back up.
Bitcoin is high risk. Could be high reward or high loss. Be careful.

LOL... you're one of *those*.


It's not a fixed supply. It has a specific total end-game amount, but the supply creation is not fixed or guaranteed. Price of coins could get to a point where a lot of miners give up and the supply slows, OR, the other way around.


Please tell me you are joking right now... You know that the definition of inflation that you are so wrong about is the same thing in austrian economics right? The terms don't change, just the ideology and theories of how best to manage an economy. Otherwise, please link me to this "Austrian economic original definition of inflation" please.
You aren't making any sense and have zero concept of what you are talking about. I'm not claiming to be an economic expert but you don't even know what inflation is and are making stuff up to try and cover up the fact that you don't have a clue what you are talking about.

Well, the cost of goods and materials is still tied to fiat and that will still be affected by the fiat markets, so no your bitcoins aren't out of the reach of governments who seek to "steal its value". Inflation affects the cost of goods and cost of living whether you hold bitcoins, dollars, or monopoly bucks.


So... you don't intend to pay taxes at all and go to prison? Not even going to pay sales tax? Property tax? I guess you never buy anything and never intend on owning any kind of property or ever having a job. And if you do, enjoy getting audited and going to prison, you bitcoin martyr you!

Your banker doesn't care about that much money in an account and it probably makes them no money. What makes them money is interest on loans primarily. They might make some money on late fees, ATM fees, or overdraft fees from you, but if you're diligent about your banking you don't pay any unneeded fees anyway so it doesn't matter whether you had $100 or a Million in your bank account.

Same thing that happens to any business with sunken costs. They will probably try to ride it out for awhile banking on a good price swing upwards, but if it doesn't come before the capital runs out they are done.

No, we don't. YOU have your definition of inflation, and I am following the *actual* definition of inflation in reality. I'm not holding some private definition of inflation in my head. It's a real word that has an actual definition.


So you see, your definition of inflation is not correct no matter how you "feel" about it. Inflation is far more about the cost of living and cost of good rising than it is simply "money creation" as you seem to say it is. You said, " in my mind, inflation is quite simple, literally, money creation", and while that's great and all it has little to do with the actual definition that everyone else in the real world uses for the word inflation.


Fed doesn't control cost of goods or cost of living... I said they control the inflation of the USD itself. When goods and cost of living rise they try to keep the dollar in check with that at a 1% inflation rate, because inflation is preferable to stagnation or worse, deflation.

Bottom line, I don't trust most people to do the right thing if given complete freedom to only pay for what they want.


Correct. *It was a statement*.


I have. But being that I'm not a teenager I didn't really go beyond reading the basics. It came off as idealistic nonsense with no actual application to reality. Plus even within libertarianism and anarchy there are constant arguments and discussion about various view points on how something would be handled. There is no real difinitive work that lays out everything that everyone would agree on. Correct me if I'm wrong.


"If you disagree with me you obviously aren't open minded or as smart as me." One of my favorite responses from anarchists, libertarians, and of course the conspiracy theorists. It's impossible there are other ways of doing things or other solutions to the problems of governance. There is only one answer to people like you, and if people don't agree with it, they arne't open minded or smart.
I won't reply anymore as these conversations with anarchists/libertarians/teenagers always lead to  the same outcome. I simply don't get it because I'm a dumb dumb and not open minded. Gotcha.

Yeah unfortunately the payback never got as much press as the bailouts initial cost. "Banks pay back loans with interest in timely fashion" isn't a headline that draws in viewers in the media, nor does it get upvotes on Reddit. The bailout stuff was all over Reddit, the payback stories went by with few upvotes and few comments.
Getting outraged is fun, pretending our economy is doomed is fun, pretending that they "PRINTED MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR!!!" is also fun. Things going as planned and the US government and Fed actually being right was not fun to people who like to be outraged and were convinced it was a terrible decision.

It's still a payment system that has value. Was speaking for the libertarian ideals of a free currency with no regulation and the fantasy of taking down the banking system some bitcoiners harbor.

Read that again for me. Ask yourself if everyone is so noble out there and that greed doesn't exist. Are people who don't read going to fund libaries? Are people without kids going to fund schools? Are people without cars going to fund roads? Do you think there aren't people out there who won't fund *anything* and just keep all their money and mooch off the stuff everyone else funds? Do you think things will be of the same quality that we have in our modern society brought to us by taxes?
This is why anarchy and libertarianism are pipe dreams. They sounds good on paper because they are based on some great sound ideals. But that's all there is, *idealism*. In the real world it simply won't function.


Didn't say there wasn't already greed in our society. You just think it will go away when no one is forced to pay taxes, and there are no laws, or police, or anything of that nature. Greed is present now, and would be even worse without laws and taxes. Greed is a constant.
And "sell off the unborn through debt to enrich themselves... what the fuck does that even mean? Just because you say a bunch of things that sound scary doesn't mean it makes any fucking sense. Shit like that may sound good in the anarchist subreddits but is kind of stretching it anywhere else on Reddit... or you know, reality.

Then they should specify.


No, I'm referring to general inflation which is basically the two more specific forms of inflation combined. They are two sides of the same coin, even your source made the same link...




Which is why many people just use the general term "inflation", and if they don't specify, that is to be assumed what they are talking about.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:36:15


Ignoring the fact that if you're a BTC holder in the US you are paying US prices for goods, which will increase based on inflation over time. You are comparing two different countries *local and official currencies*. BTC isn't a government backed currency but it's value is realized when you change it into fiat in your country or have to purchase goods in your country. If BTC, for whatever reason had a fixed rate (no inflation or deflation), and the USD market inflated and cost of goods went up, that means that cost of goods go up for people spending BTC as well, regardless of whether your supply went up or down. Why? Because stuff isn't priced in BTC. So if the cost of Rent goes up in dollars for your apartment, and the BTC price stays flat, you're going to owe more bitcoins as well for rent. Same for milk, or a loaf of bread, etc. Again, are you denying that if BTC stayed flat in price, and the USD cost of goods inflated, that you wouldn't lose buying power too? Because that's *not* something I'm misunderstanding, that's reality. Replace the US in my example with any local currency.


No, not same with bitcoin. If you're a BTC holder in Europe while the EU starts massively printing Euro your cost of goods and cost of living is going to rise and your BTC will lose value when you go to purchase anything. Sure, 1 BTC would still be worth one BTC, but 1 BTC would be worth an entirely different amount of euros and the cost of goods would go up for you locally so your buying power would be less per BTC before the Euro massively inflated. But sure, if you were a BTC holder in the US at that time and cost of goods and living there remained stable you'd be fine. BTC value is realized when you need to purchase something or convert to fiat. That's what I mean by BTC being tied to the local fiat currency.
When you compare Euros, and dollars, and Yen, stuff *IS* priced for sale and produced in that currency in those countries. BTC is not a local currency in any country and is pegged to whatever cost of goods is denominated in at that particular point of sale. That's the difference, and it's a big one you are completely missing.

How are dollars meanlingless when they are accepted everywhere compared to bitcoins that are accepted in few places and extremely volatile?

The one and only way to support Reddit right now is Reddit Gold, and they accept Bitcoin... so  what more are you asking for? Reddit is a free site and really isn't dealing with financial transactions other than Gold. So I don't understand why you think they should "embrace crypto". They aren't selling a product, it's a free site, so where exactly does currency (other than purchasing Gold which already accepts bitcoin) come into play?

If it's not, "bitcoin is going to topple world governments and all the evil banks and only rise in price and its totally stable" you get downvoted. Simply pointing out uncertainties is frowned upon here.

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:08:50
A central bank could theoretically buy up a huge share of bitcoins and either release them, or hold them to help control supply issues. The act of adjusting interest rates would also be something that could be done whether people are using fiat or BTC. They could also still do QE to inject money into the economy.
The *only* aspect of central banking that would be somewhat different in a world of bitcoin would be the ability to order more money to be printed. Again, they could choose ro release BTC from a reserve to hedge deflation, but they would have a limit on that unlike being able to print ocassionally as the population grows and new wealth is created in the markets.

Supply isn't the only factor in inflation or deflation. You know that, right?
The reason USD is predictable is that despite the unknown supply, they have a goal of a small 1% uinflation to intentionally keep the USD stable. That's one of the jobs of the FED. I know people here hate the Fed, but that's why it exists. They control the rate of inflation through various mechanisms of the economy to keep the rate the same as best they can. That is predictable, unlike the Wild Wild West of Bitcoin where you have no idea how much coins will be worth day to day. Yesterday, $280, today, $228 and still dropping.

Well then make sure you vote in the Republican primaries in your state. The attendance in primaries in most states are abysmal, and if you're in the 18-29 year old bracket only like 5%-10% of them show up to primaries. They are terrible in showing up to the elections that matter.
So look up GOP primaries in your state, and find out what you need to do now to be register to be able to participate. Some caucus, some primary, some are open, some are closed unless you're registered, etc. I only know what my state does and it's open. Even when I don't end up voting republican in the final election I still participate in their primaries, because those matter a hell of a lot more than the final presidential election. By then you have no choice.
That's why I hate the "we only have two choices!" arguments from Redditors every year. They only have two choices because they don't participate in the process leading up to that then they cry like babies.
Seriously. Everyone reading this. Learn about primaries, do what you have to do to participate, and show up.

And I definitely get and appreciate that sentiment, I just don't think it's going to happen. If bitcoin starts taking off the people in control right now are going to be the people with the most money to throw into the game. They won't lose their financial power just because a handful of early adopters are also getting rich. They'll come in, in force, and control the BTC economy too. And what's even worse, is that the BTC economy as it stands is more susceptible to manipulation than even the current markets are. The current system might be corrupt in certain aspects, but there is also at least some control.

You get thousands of hops because a mesh network has no real backbone. You would jump from node to node until your destination. That's okay to cover small areas, but would be slow and have many issues over a country our globe. Routing would be difficult. Right now with major hubs and backbones those hops are eliminated for the most part. But with mesh it would be a nightmare for traffic to cover large distances. 
Satellites are expensive and to replace the internet you'd need a ton of them. When you lay fiber, you lay a bundle of them. With satellites there's one to one connectivity and no real backbone that's efficient. Not to mention the equipment needed for a user to communicate with them would also be expensive, shutting out a lot off poor nations.

It's not that they feel "threatened", it's just their job to keep up with trends in the market and stay on top of it. The banks and various financial institutions are no different. Businesses will still need credit, home buyers and car owners will still need loans, people will still want security and protection, etc.
Money is money to banks. They don't give a shit about the libertarian and anarchist ideals behind bitcoin. They'll take your dollars, your pounds, your francs, and your bitcoin, and create some service structure around it.

True, but that also comes with a lot of negatives. As it rises in value you get more people into the BTC game that are just doing it for speculation and the possibility for making more money (this is already common). Deflationary currencies promote hording. Why spend your BTC today if the price is on a steep rise? That's why most governments with controlled currencies prefer a *small* and *manageable* amount of inflation over the risk of it falling into deflation.
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:16:20


Ok, so where can I find Satoshi Nakamoto communications and stated purpose of bitcoin? He created it, and you say it was created to overthrow the government, yet to my knowledge no one knows who he is and he's never really made any public statements regarding bitcoin or *anything* other than the original paper. I've read his paper, and am linking it below. Please point out where he mentions anything about creating bitcoin for anti-government applications, or "bringing down the financial system".


Right, because you're currently not a part of the exact same system I am? You know what the best part about being an anarchist is? Feeling superior to everyone even though you are in that exact same situation they are, just more smug about it and probably worse off. I think there are plenty of problems to fix in government but it's still far preferable to a *lack* of government. Don't see how that makes me a "slave". I'd rather work on what we have than lay back and wait for some idealistic pipe dream to come to fruition.
As with most conversations with ancaps/anarchists, this conversation will go nowhere. So I'll just make this my last reply. I need to get back to slaving in the salt mines anyway.

Go buy a pre-paid Visa card.


Go to a place that has money wiring services, they take the cash, and send the money.
Of course that's not as efficient as bitcoin for those two situations, but the option to be your own bank exists with cash, its just not as functional. I could say similar things about bitcoins without using a bank. Like, how do you get a home or car loan without a bank?

Yeah, but I mean you have to admit over the last couple years this subreddit has gone from pretty decent to kind of shitty. There's a lot more self posts and "Here's why I'm in awe of Bitcoin" type posts where they talk about the coming government collapsing and the dollar crashing because of bitcoin.
Sure, you and others might not see that as crazy, but to the random passers by and people that don't post a lot, we're just rolling our eyes it's so bad. This place is even heading into new territory and starting to resemble in many ways.
I mean if you enjoy it that's fine. But this subreddit doesn't appear sane to anyone stumbling in here who is just interested in learning more about bitcoin and getting onboard.

But that provides no new utility (for most people) beyond cash, credit cards, or check cards. Most people aren't going to care about the "be your own bank" and "down with the man" type reasons for getting into bitcoin. People act like being able to buy *some things* with bitcoin at some places means it's better than fiat for some reason. Why is that?
People can already buy all those things, because what they are currently using is accepted *EVERYWHERE*. There has to be a better reason for them to use bitcoin other than "You can use it *some* places!" Money transfers are a big thing, and so is dark market type stuff, but beyond that there's not really a lot of major reasons to get into bitcoin for the mainstream.
I know why people here like it, but you have to put yourself in the shoes of your average person.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:01:42

Kind of, but gold is also tangible and looked beautiful and as a result was used more than just a currency. Even today it's still coveted for certain industrial applications, and still jewelry.
The ONLY thing bitcoin has in common with gold is the principle of limited supply. But that's also why pretty much *every* single country on the planet moved away from gold back currencies. It wasn't safe. Another country "finding" a new vast gold supply could sell it all off and tank another countries holdings, or vice versa. It wasn't safe from manipulation by every countries because gold could theoretically be found in lots of countries. One way to take that power away was to create a currency that only "you" as a country create that isn't backed by anything except for the government.

Because transferring money in those amounts isn't something the average person needs to do? It works for immigrants sending money back home, and that is definitely a niche BTC can fill.

And where will your income be coming from when everyone else is thinking that same thing and stops buying things and spending their money? Why buy things when your money will be worth more next month or next year? This leads to a domino effect on the production and employment of an economy. Spending drops, lending drops, and its off to the great depression II.
Great, you see temporary personal value of your money increase, while your country crumbles around you. Most would say that's not a good economic model. You see a temporary increase in value of your savings, but the longterm ramifications are terrible. But hey, as long as your savings are going up, fuck society and everyone else right!?

You know banks do other things, right?


Maybe not for you. But ever want to own a home someday? Buy a car? Start a business? Need some emergency funds for unforseen medical expenses? You see, there's these things called "loans" and they are a big part of how banks make their money. With such an asinine statement I could just say "Bitcoin isn't necessary" with as much ease.
Lending/loans/credit is a major reason as to why banks exist. People and businesses will still want loans even if bitcoin were to see worldwide adoption. *Banks still provide that*. There's also fraud protection, insured deposits, etc. Sure, "wearing" your life savings on you sounds great when you're young and don't have a ton of savings or need loans, but that sounds retardedly risky for any adult with a family to take care of, and offers no fraud/theft protection.
And yes I'm familiar with the whole "blockchain contract" thing for lending, but there are a lot of problems with that and it's not flexible or agile enough to handle business and personal needs for many aspects of lending. This is where banks come in and offer those services. They could still do so in Bitcoin, although it would be a little more difficult.
But if you think just because you can "carry all your money with you everywhere" means that banks and financial institutions won't have services to offer you're living in some fictional dreamworld. There already are Bitcoin companies that will "hold your currency" and offer services similar to banks.
I know a lot of bitcoin holders have some weird libertarian/anarchist dream where they think the banks are going to crumble because of bitcoin, but they'll just adapt and use it and trade in it and service it to. It's just another currency to them. Did banks crumble when the Euro came out even though it was stronger than the dollar? Of course not. It's just another currency and will be treated as such by the banks.

The government did not *give*, they *loaned*. All of which has been paid back with interest, and the government/treasury actually *made* money on the bailouts.
Some people here know this, some people do not, and some know it but like to skew the information anyway to still pretend like it was a terrible decision to bailout failing companies even though the government profited from it. It's hard for many here to admit it wasn't the horrible mistake they originally said it would be.
Whether people agree with this method of governing the economy is one thing, but to pretend that money was "given" away or not returned is just wrong.

... Are you really that much of a tool? Anyone you disagree with must be a "typical government lackey" because your views are so  much more intelligent? *Get over yourself*. 


While true for some aspects of the bailout calculations, it isn't across the board. Plus, that article is attacking the Washington Post's article... I didn't use that article as a source.
Also, that source of your relies entirely on considering that the Fed should not be considered private in these situations. But isn't that a big thing here in and with most libertarians, that the Fed is private? The fed being private or not can't just flip flop back and worth depending on when it works best for ones argument. The fed is either private, or it isn't.
Also the argument of Fannie and Freddie is a good one, because they are apart of the government in a way, similar to the Fed. Which is why the Fannie and Freddie bailout was separate from the TARP fund and accounted for separately, which your article fails to mention, and my source clearly separates when showing the numbers. It acknowledges exactly what your article points out. Again, you're article was criticizing the Washington Post article... which I did not post.
So yeah, your source raises many good and fair points, I just think it's a little off considering it isn't attacking the content of my link.

You don't need to "put ink on paper" to open a taditional trading account...


But that's just vague nonsense. Traditional finances use cryptography for securing data and transactions across the wire. What I believe you are actually trying to say is different is the utilization of a public ledger, which is different from traditional finance. Cryptography by itself is not what makes bitcoin great, that's just what makes it secure. But it's also what makes wire transfer secure, VPNs secure, bank databases secure, etc.
You speak using some buzzwords but don't appear to actually know the proper context in which to use them or how they apply to your arguments.

Not to mention most 401k and IRA funds *are* diversified. Even if you had all your money in a good fund, even that's diversified amongst bonds, cash markets, companies, commodities, etc. At least companies produce and make things and earn revenue. With bitcoin your only value comes from the *hope* that other people buy into it. It could pay off big, though, but it's not certain.
Bitcoin would be considered high risk high reward, but possible high losses as well. But it's pure speculation.

Gold is physical and has applications beyond speculation. Sure it's over priced for what it is, but it's rare, it has uses, and will always have *some* value. Bitcoin has the potential to have *zero* value.

You are interchanging the terms bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptography and using them all out of context and if they mean the same thing. Your last post you were talking about cryptography in general, now you're telling me I don't know what the blockchain is which is a different thing all together.
Again, I just think you know all the little buzzwords surrounding bitcoin but it's clear you have no idea how to use them in context or apply them to an actual conversation. You just keep telling people "you don't get it" if they don't agree with your drivel. But honestly, it's clear you don't get it.

There's a lot of blind zealots around here who just like the buzzwords in the bitcoin community and think anyone using them must be doing something revolutionary. In this case, I hope this Dotcom dude doesn't use/abuse the bitcoin blockchain for some stupid/shitty torrent tracking type thing that he wants to promote.

It's worse than a small amount of controlled inflation.


Except that doesn't make any sense. It's always going to be bad because it promotes hoarding, hinders lending, and makes any debts more unmanageable and harder and harder to pay back as the currency deflates. None of those concepts are going away even if bitcoin were to become the primary currency. I know some people in this subreddit have this fantasy that bitcoin is going to change the entire financial industry, banking, and economy, but it's just that, a fantasy.

Well, good for you, but you are far from every person and every business. Different businesses require different funding. Starting an online business takes little to no money. Starting a brick-and-mortar business or production business on the other hand takes lots of money. And not everyone has enough of that money in their checking account. I'm assuming your businesses weren't brick-and-mortar and not in manufacturing, because even if you had that kind of startup money, no one would keep hundreds of thousands of dollars in a checking account...
You're just ONE example, and you didn't need a loan. Congratulations, but that doesn't disprove lending is a integral part of our world right now.


That's an entirely different argument. You can feel that way, but your personal opinion on cars doesn't mean that it's not an example of an item that many people use loans for.

But at the same time I can't claim to know what would have happened to the economy had we *not* performed any bailouts.

Really... and you said "what" to deflation promotes hoarding? I somehow doubt you're a macro specialist. Maybe you mean Micromachine specialist?

... wow. So the only options to you are using bitcoin, or *credit* cards? You know there's cash, checks, and check cards, right? Those don't require going into debt. Also, there are plenty of stories even here in about people losing tens of thousands of dollars on bitcoin, so it's certainly not immune to debt and losses. Are you also implying that if your kids use bitcoin they'll never have to work in their lives? Are you just going to preach to your son this pure fantasy of an unknown future for a relatively new form of currency that may or not stand the test of time?
There is so much delusion and naivety in your comment I'm honestly kind of shocked and don't really know what to say. Please don't teach your kid this same deluded nonsense that you are buying into. I believe in bitcoin too, but the way you are speaking about it is just naive.

I agree with you, but from puck2 said he wouldn't be "educating" them, he'd be giving them one side of the story.  Do you see how he phrased it? "Either they use bitcoin, **OR** you become a debt slave, have to work for the rest of your live, and will be a terrible terrible person in credit debt!" That is VERY one sided and intellectually dishonest, and isn't educating the kid on the realities of both.
If what he explained was educating him on bitcoin and the current financial system, yeah that's fine. I have no problem with him educating his son on bitcoin, what I have a problem with is the way he described it sounds totally one sided and dishonest.
So yes you are right, education and indoctrination are not the same thing, but what puck2 described *was* indoctrination.

So you bought btc, it went down in value, and that's an argument that it's a good store of value? 
Jesus some of you are so brainwashed. You'll believe anything.

And then with the people that do participate in Bitcoin, you have to take another large percentage out of that group who are just in it to hold/day-trade/speculate.

That sounds fucking terrible.

So if you're answer to inflation is bitcoin, did you also talk about one of the downsides of bitcoin being a fixed supply of coins and how it will eventually *deflate*, and that it comes with negatives of its own that will eventually have to be dealt with? Or did you just ignore that part?
Also I love these posts where high school or college kids pretend to be economic experts because they only talk about the positives of bitcoin but of course never acknowledge any of the downsides.
