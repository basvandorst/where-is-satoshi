A permanent race to find a solution to a problem. Whenever one is found you get the privilege to craft a new lego block and stack it on top of every block that has ever existed. Whenever a new block is found the whole stack is part of the next problem everybody's now looking for the solution to. Whenever a transaction is sent the winner that finds the new lego block first gets all the transaction fees from the transactions therein. Once a transaction has been part of the new block, every additional block will make the  transaction more secure. 5 blocks and you should be able to trust sums of value bigger than your house.

How do you feel about a dollar equivalent amount of a bitcoin though? Any amount of metals, oil or crops can NOT fix that without a inordinately huge amount of trust. Reddit gold is nice, but it has absolutely zero on the network effect and liquidity bitcoin already has.
Aluminium has value because it can transmit high voltage electricity and it's possible to build a power grid on top of that. Copper has value because it can transmt electronic signals and you can build computers and the internet on top of that. Bitcoin has value because it can transmit value and it's possible to build a financial internet on top of that. 
To dismiss that is without at the same time insisting you'd be fine without electricity/net access IS pretty dense and require further elaboration.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:05:17
You could also make a paper wallet and send med the private key, some 64characters on pm, and throw a dollar of funds in there at mayyybe 30-50 satoshi of fees. It is faster and I don't have to give you any information to be ble to access the funds, later on. 
But both of the options you mention happen to provide a service that keeps them in business(for now), and as such can be assumed to produce value for their customers.
Keep insisting bitcoin has zero value and you'd still be wrong, luckily you are so on an anonymous online forum so there is no reputation on the line for you.

Disregard all other uses of internet money and just look at transactions. 
If the goal is to invent a fully functioning jumbo jet (global payment system), then bitcoin would be something like a bike. This bike won't fly even if you're running downhill with zero payload.
The superior bitcoin cash? It's a tandem bike! Twice as long, but functionally just as useless at flying as the alternatives. Congrats on a superior alternative where the long-term answer it to extend the bike and slap on a pair of pedals! There's a reason the superior solution was to go from 1mb to 2mb, and applauding that as a BIG BIG win, and not going for 20 or 200, right away.

How many entities do you currently have digital transfer arrangements with? 1-2 banks. 3-4 credit cards. Coinbase? 
Say six different entities, and you'd expect maybe a maximum of that, for yourself. Once a big network like Visa/Mastercard is on board, you'd need your employer/coinbase to have LN channel to your micro payment provider, and they'd have a channel to every provider that all of the services you use on a day to day basis have. No need to touch the main chain for weeks or years. Picking a decent LN provider will be like buying other recreational software; reviews, analysis of uptime stats and ping should be a major factor in picking one in addition to name recognition. If you're stuck with a bad one you're partly to blame yourself.

Depends on the significance of the amount/time horizon.
Your buddy will be able to laugh off the loss of one btc, and will be more interested in spending it/ease of use over security? Reputable phone wallet, and (strobg preference) some sort of backup option. The best wallets make this easy. 
Going past a couple of weeks of paycheck, and long-term investment, better fire up a more secure environment and generate a paper wallet. Preferably severalonce you have the setup done right, to be able to withdraw one and one of these wallets, instead of spending the whole stash, every time a smaller withdrawal needs to be done. Keep spending cash on a phone wallet though.

The capacity problem was solved yesterday, literally, by a tweet from the lead developer. Google inverse bloom filters. When that is implemented the capacity should be good for another ~250tx/s, instead of 7 now.
Also, for things like the reddit tipbot, you can have millions of transactions, but only use the block chain when moving funds on to, or off the system. If you do numerous small transactions, you might carry a balance and draw from that at the.time of each use. I only use my phone for bus tickets, and only top up the balance every 8 tickets used. Off blockchain, solutions will pop up!
This IS a nice problem to have to solve, after all.

@_date: 2014-10-13 06:36:05
Super interesting angle: your project has the potential to launch distributed business ventures. 
Consider this value proposal, invest in buying the kit and use any revenue stream to pay back what it cost. You get an instant promotional WiFI spot, and you could possibly recoup some of that money (far better than a lot of other proposals).
Fair enough, but every city is different. If you propose a business plan on how to get local cooperation on board (localized advertising have better impact), you can easily raise capital for 100x pi's overnight. Just do a reasonably big safety deposit for the guys handling the equipment, and you should be good to go. Getting this up&amp;running (subscriptionless, cryptofunded internet) could easily be claimed as a functional precursor to true meshnet internet access.
If your business is to sell those raspberries at cost, and grab a certain share of the ad/use revenue, you could scale way faster if you farm out local business deals, situating &amp; debt funding. 
Selling free wifi will be hard (3g+existing infrastructure), but thus thing has the potential of getting bandwidth down to the price of electricity by fostering perfect competition ( clode to what bitcoin mining have done).
Now getting such a network up&amp;running, hosts can get rewarded from how much traffic are actually used, this can be incentive to get a seriously big uplink, so you'd get better internet speeds at the bus stop than you'd get at home(!). People are already sharing wifi with their neighbors today, and getting such a device would make it way easier to split costs evenly. Recruiting existing providers into running your free wifi setup instead could be an easy switchover if you prove to not suck balls. Hooking this up to a 4G uplink could make a free wifi anywhere situation.
When you scale properly, you suddenly have the following: a shitlod of customers CURRENTLY PAYING TOO MUCH for internet. Buy into your network, and get access to wholesale rates at a decent provider! This is good for the network, good for the host &amp; ISP, but bad for Comcast. Everybody rejoice!
If you get some sort of authorization by private key, you can prove that different entities are using the same connection. This should make is wayyy much easier to share a network connection as a AirBnB host for example. This would be the tourist angle. If you log into a spot it's possible to browse local restaurants and touristy items, as well as all the local essentials (taxi, takeout and public transport).
If it's possible to make this a micropay-to-play service, local editors would have an incentive to provide sustainable quality in content. Local media could totally go along with some sort of cooperation on access point content as well.
Edit: [Outernet]( your stuff and this service could easily provide free-tier internet service, and have a slightly more expensive mobile uplink for premium-tier content. This means Internet EVERYWHERE, as long as you got 12 volts.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:05:22
The cost of implementing payment should't be too costly. (unless you have to burn tens of hours on setting this up &amp; staff training)..
Depending on your location, international tourists(visits abroad with traveller's credit cards and currency conversion makes this extra appealing) may want to visit your place, as well as having visibility on places like  will give early movers a visibility boost.

I'd suggest making a *Ladder of Paranoia*, so that people are not overwhelmed at step 1, but still know that they're expected to go more in-depth about security before doing something stupid (life savings backed up on dropbox).
The yard stick would be "How long does it take you to make the coins back in case of catastrophic loss?"
My personal ladder would be something like this:
0 to 5 hours of work: phone walled un-backed up.
5h to 1 week of pay: online exchange of reasonable reputation
1 to 4 weeks of pay: Encrypted&amp;backed up several places. The key is of secure origin?
1 month+: Seriously. This key gets generated with fair dice on an airgapped device. Several fire-proof strips of metal storage will be made and stored at different secure locations.
1 year of pay: the cost basis need to be really low to keep this much in bitcoin..
The good thing about such a scheme, is that it takes into consideratiln the current replacement value. This means if your coins appreciat in value, you should re-think security and move them to a wallet of more secure character as you climb that ladder.

Your provider may have something to say about it, as well as limits on running too much traffic from a single access point, but yeah.

You can actually make your own subreddit (with hookers and blackjack). I'd say encouraging people to work together on group buys. Have people organize and list possible locations in a city on that subreddit, and pitch in (Kickstarter effect ftw). The only thing you'd need to implement would be to support split payouts to encourage people do go for split ownership.

*That you see*. How would you like to split the savings with the businesses you shop with if their fees went away?


New product, low volume, not much competition. Yeah. They're not working for free, but the whole operation have lower cost structure than existing payment providers,  and lower barriers to entry. In a future with higher transaction volume and more competition for your business, things are going to look a bit more appealing.

That's nice, but timing a buy closer to a bottom, $150, $100 or $50 sparking a bull run will be an even more i teresting proposal..

Actually. If it were still possible when I downloaded the wallet back in '11 I'd be paying way more in taxes over the last few years.

@_date: 2016-10-13 06:34:35
There's this argument that there will allways be demand for USD, because taxes needs to be paid in that currency. Likewise only bitcoin can be used to pay miners
Or can it? Technically you COULD make a second layer, paying miners in other currencies, to include your zero-fee transaction in blocks Find a miner who agrees, and even overpay a little and you should be good.

I've been thinking about similar publicly funded roadside bounties. You hate a certain bend in the road, or could have made safer driving if some trees/brushes/buildings were not blocking your view along your daily drive? Throw bitcoins at the problem, and advertise the solution. 5 years on, early bitcoin users might have done more for the roadside safety than local traffic authorities ever will. It also makes it pretty easy to organize thousands of users unhappy about the road into making actual changes happen!

This is where off chain stuff like lightening network etc happens. You're able to do thousands of microtransactions for every time you're touching actual blockchain funds.
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:52:14


This is what I'm talking about. If there were a MASSIVE disparity between blockchain throughput, and number of payment channel close-outs, would there be opportunity to push transactions onto the blockchain by paying obscenely high fees to get some transaction to go through before a refund transaction triggers? A meltdown like that, lasting for several days could spell trouble, if the escrow software does not deal with transaction fees surging
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:23:53
It can't steal your funds, only sit on it for a certain amount of time. This isn't fatal, but will be very annoying and ensure a BUNCH of bad ratings for that specific service, and out of self-interest this should keep most actors honest
Fun question, though. What if a payment channel provider goes full Mt.Gox? Not the stealing of funds, but they shit the bed, and cease operations, effective immediately. If this happens at a point where LN has millions of microtransactions, but bitcoin has still roughly the same capacity (blocks of 1, 2, or 20Mb). What will happen if several million payment channels time out all at once and hits the blockchain at the same time? Could this lead to centralization that have the potential to damage the bitcoin network?

Fees are rising, which is GOOD for bitcoin. Lots of people are using non-fee estimating software and pays up too little, and are then disappointed about slow service. This is bad.
The amount of goodness implied in a functioning fee market has a bigger impact on the price, than the steadily dropping number of people running old/dumb software. Overall this makes for a nice jump in price.

Sanders policy suggestions are first and foremost a solar plexus hit to corporate influence over US government. A paid-off corp-sponsored president Clinton have way higher aversion to sensible policymaking, than Sanders, if you look at the amounts of unpaid favors each candidate owe their sponsors.

The fun thing is that if you're getting into on the investment end of such a deal, you've got ownership diversified out into several vehicles, everything is properly insured abd everyone you're dealing with has a system reputation to care about so they want to be nice to do business with.
Investing into a Autonomous Vehicle pool like that can potentially make way more sense, than owning a single car outright, and can potentially be very liquid to get into/out of. Getting zero interest on your bank account from payday to rent payment day, will be a thing of the past

No? You've done research into bitcoins? What's the worst that could happen? Sudden downward shift in value when a lot of coins are dumpet into the market? I think that's one of the smaller worries about the bitcoin, and also one that'll grow smaller as the total system increases in value. 
If your biggest worry is that _someone_ is getting rich, here, that isn't a big worry either. I'd suggest solving that by having those people have a nice cultured chat with about pledging most of that money toward charity..
Now if you're up for some big and important conspiracies that actually matter I'd suggest looking into Monsanto and the reluctance to doing something about the heat retention of the planet.
