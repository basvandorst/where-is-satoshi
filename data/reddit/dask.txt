They aren't impossible to afford though.. Greece is within spitting distance of a primary surplus.  All that has to go is the debt.   If it is in the people's interest to default, then the government should just default on all of it. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:55:41
precisely.  No bitcoin is created, only transferred.  To expand the bitcoin supply through lending, you'd have to allow claims to bitcoins to trade fungibly with bitcoins.  There is no mechanism to do that on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:53:53
I don't know if that's really expanding the supply though.  You have to deposit bitcoins with them, and the borrower takes possession. If you don't get paid back, then the depositor is out of luck.  There are no more bitcoins in existence.  
It does increase the velocity though, which has a similar effect on price.  Golden rule = don't be the depositor in a fractional reserve scheme, and once the bitcoin is in a private wallet, you're good.
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:05:15
Why are they being downvoted?  I own BTC, but ignoring the fact that it will take a huge inflow of cash like this every month for years yet to maintain the price is not helpful. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:15:24
Good point and no doubt that it is; as I said, I do own them.  That doesn't take away from the fact that said new money must still actually be flowing in all the time to justify those forecasts. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:19:22
I've seen estimates (nothing credible) that the amount sold directly has moved from ~50% up to about 80%, due to declining margins on hardware and the price drop.  I would actually prefer if the higher number were true, because it means we are seeing more external inflows, which is the ultimate point of the game.  Also, every new merchant is another outlet (for now).  I see the stabilization at $4xx and recent gain as very positive in this light.

Late to the show, but I have a Kraken account linked to a Swedish bank, but am also a cavirtex customer/Canadian citizen.   Will it be possible to link these accounts?  Use you as a currency exchange?  I would dearly love to be able to coordinate my BTC/CAD/SEK finances through a single hub.   
Also, Kraken is fantastic, and your AMA has greatly improved my opinion of your business.  Cool, rational, transparent leadership. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:51:10
They've just tightened them up a bit. Last I looked it was +2.5% on the buy and -4% on the sell.. not great, but good enough.  I also use Kraken, but with the 50 sek sepa transfer fee that SEB charges me you have to buy more than ~5000 SEK (650 USD) at a time to come out ahead.    Much better for trading though.

Awesome; in that case the only advantage Safello has is that you can pay with Swish; last time for me, trying to call the bottom, I got my coins in 6 hours from money leaving my account.  For all other purposes Kraken will be about 20 SEK per  1000 SEK cheaper for you to buy, and way better to sell. Maybe time to investigate a switch on my end..

Money has to be sent from the address before the pubkey is revealed and it's vulnerable.  'Savings' addresses have the pubkey obscured by   two hash functions, both of which are quantum-resistant.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:47:44
To be pedantic, I believe the address is ripe160(sha256(pubkey))), so there are two hash functions, both of which would have to be broken to get a pubkey from an address.

Yes, or not quite depending on the specific.   It takes the transaction details, and, in an untouchable environment verifies them and signs it.  If it just spat out a password, it could be intercepted.  The signed transaction goes back to the computer... it can be intercepted, but who cares because you can't modifiy it or see the private key.

One of the ultimate sources of value for state-fiat is that everyone around you has to get their mitts on some in order to pay tax, giving in theory some minimum demand, backed by the ability of the state to coerce.   Bitcoin doesn't have that, true..   Bitcoin will instead have to rely on continuous voluntary bids because it is the best way to do something.

Whatever coins traded will be valued as a gain (big for him, buying in 2013) at the value when traded.   Taxes owed.   If he sold at the low (incurring a loss from the previous valuation), he'd have a loss, but couldn't use it until the next tax year.

Think of the bond as 'how much would you pay right now to get $100 on some set day in the future'.    If the interest rate is high, you would pay less for that right now.  If the interest rate was 0, you'd pay 100 etc.  
The further in the future said payment day is, the bigger the swing, and if you bought a cheap bond when the rate was higher and the rate drops, you can offload it for a profit.

A fantastic comment. 
some questions.. if you settle financial assets via some blockchain mechanism e.g. coloured coin .. 1) there are LOTS of transactions, even settling.  2) you can afford to pay fairly high transaction fees.   If bitcoin can scale, this is very good for the long term. If not, then could it raise the fees to a point where something like microchannels are required to make smaller payments work reasonably?

Good balanced trading, big buys on the up and down.. slow and steady.   Almost 2000 coins taken off the 300 wall.  Looking good, but most of all, I'm liking the volume on the two year chart. If the mtgox thing didn't happen, we are looking at a nice steady linear ramp in volume.

Conspiracy away!   I'll start:
1)They are finally getting seriously worried that Bitcoin is going to run away from them and they are bringing in the woman who masterminded JPMs (busted) commodity and gold rigging operations.  Perhaps some fractional reserving bank hub to try and suck up investment demand for bitcoin itself.  /onlyhalfsarcastic
Anyone else?
Seriously though, it makes me glad that they a) can't force themselves as an intermediary between anybody else, and b) the nature of bitcoin itself seriously limits the kinds of shenanigans that can go on. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 10:21:04
As I understand it, the natural restraint in the system is something like.. an overleveraged bank can have reserves/funding removed by their competitors/central bank.. even though there is no longer a 'hard' reserve ratio, there is effectively a soft one that is enforced by the relations between the big 5.

'over-the-counter' aka the good old practice of phoning someone you know has a lot to see if they are willing to make a private transaction.   People who want to sell/buy lots in a go without altering the market price (e.g. some miners, US marshals, some whales etc. ) need to do it privately, and the network of entities/people who sell privately for cash is known as the OTC market. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 20:58:50
Fair enough on the third party, but we were talking transactions and valuation.  With liquid/debit cards or lightning, a whole lot of transactions could be done 'off chain'  (hub and spoke, I'll give you that).. the 24 tps settlement could support far more transactions than 24.  And you could still use bitcoin p2p.  I was simply trying to put up how bitcoin could hit a paypal like functionality/valuation. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:13:03
The hardware randomness is pretty good. If you are seriously worried, you can manually add a hash salt, taking you as far as you feel you need to go.

Yep. Come explain yourself.
@_date: 2015-10-30 12:36:46
Paypal = 38 tps average over the year (2015).  This could be 8mb blocks, but there are a lot of other ways to reach this.  Lightning, or imagine exchanges offering coinbase/bitpay style service along with the liquid side chain for instant transactions.  
It could also get there without much more than 5 tps if the store of value/etf etc. aspect grows faster than the means of payment.   
Big challenge, but there's definitely hope! Seems like a better bet to me than trying for a ten-bagger on mining shares or something like that.

The trick is expectation of future value. 
It's not so much 'psychology' as thousands of years of continual use as a wealth reserve, then a currency, then a wealth reserve.   Gold is literally ingrained in cultures, and thus the 'gold will be valuable tomorrow' has a very high likelihood of being perceived as true to the vast majority of the world's population. 
wrt Bitcoin, one can expect that if it takes off, it will be immensely valuable, but the 'what if it doesn't' will be equally strong until much experience is gained with it.   I am speculatively pro bitcoin, but 'What if X happens tomorrow to make it worthless?' will be a very difficult fear to shake for a very long time. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:44:55
Devil's Advocate, why?
Gold is there because it is the only nonfiat asset on all the balance sheets of all the central banks in the eurosystem and was included by treaty to underpin the Euro as a currency. 
Why should bitcoin get the same treatment?
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:05:07
1st, wrong, bitcoin is not legal tender in Germany.  Those words have a very specific meaning.  All germany has done is recognize it as a currency, meaning no Vat to buy, same long term capital gains treatment as any other currency. 
All other countries have the same option, but Gold is actually by treaty the foundation of the ECB reserves.  Not as a currency but as an asset reserve. Validated, by the parliaments of every country in the EU. There is no bitcoin on the ECB system balance sheet.  Seeing as how there was a treaty to include gold, bitcoin would require another treaty to give the same treatment.  Care to put it to a vote in every EU country?  Care to ask the ECB what they think?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:18:20
To expand on this, governments not only say it has value, but force a demand for the currency by denominating taxes in it, which has a critical role because everyone must obtain said currency units.

@_date: 2013-12-06 12:59:33
Some other points on gold;  Disclaimer: It may not be popular in this sub, but I own gold as well as bitcoin (and have for a decade).
-It is claimed that Bitcoin is the biggest crypto because of the network effect; gold has a worldwide network of more than a billion (small peasants in India combine to save in 1g increments) people on every continent able to cash buy and sell.   
-Gold is one of the few currencies in history that has been acceptable for international settlement. 
-Gold has no equal (and will never) in physical commodities in terms of stock to flow (difficulty to inflate). 
-Gold is the only nonfiat/non counterparty asset on the balance sheet of many of the worlds central banks.  If there is a USD crisis again this property alone makes it the most likely thing (at present) to be the next world reserve asset or target for reflation efforts.
-Gold mining can be shut down, but the mining is not necessary to maintain the coherence of the stock.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:10:34
Most EU countries charge VAT on silver.   Gold is exempt from VAT in all EU countries under one of the founding Euro treaties.  Some EU countries (e.g. germany) don't even have capital gains tax on gold. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:27:52
I wouldn't go so far as EXACTLY.. Bitcoin is different in some important ways. to take two examples.
Gov't fiat will always have a demand as long as taxes are required to be paid in it.  People may or may not demand Bitcoin in the future. We all will decide its fate collectively.
Gold does not require effort to maintain already produced units, is backed by one of the largest distribution networks on the planet and has cultural memories of millenia.   Bitcoin can however be transmitted, which may or may not eventually overcome some of these differences.  In addition, there is no other physical substance with Golds properties (chiefly the stock to flow ratio).  Bitcoin may be duplicated and overtaken if another implementation offers properties that are better enough to overcome its network effect.
