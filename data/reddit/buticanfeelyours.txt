All I'm seeing is proof that Japan &gt; China.

What? 
The offer was for free accommodation to those barred from entering the states. As in people without the money and who have illegal visas. All this virtue signalling makes me sick but what you are saying is false.

I've seen scores of screenshots of posts getting removed though. Even if the posts were wrong it could have been a good debate, but they got deleted?

Aren't a lot of posts from the 'other side' getting removed though? 
I don't know enough to have an opinion, I just know that's not how to have a debate.

I heard it's really easy to pad out the number of nodes?

These are a total rip off of Oakley Holbrook's. I guarantee you they have a profit margin in those sunnies, even @ $10  with shipping included. 
They are trash.

Cool yeah, hey if I'm wrong you've stumbled on a gold mine!

Are we allowed to promote altcoins here?

There pretty much is this model already, you can rent/buy shows off iTunes etc and consume your content that way.
Trouble is those fools want $2 an episode, so it adds up quick. I think Netflix uses their massive buying power to lean on content owners and get them to let you watch their media for cheaper than they would ever be willing to let you watch it if you bought it on its own.

How would creating new accounts and deleting old comments solve OP's concern? 
Deleting comments would have no effect, they log it all and own it from the second you post it. Changing usernames? Why? So it's marginally harder to tie you to your content that Reddit sells?

We know. Sometimes people use a little dramatic license as a fun way to explore a topic. If you work hard, someday you may be able to recognise human emotions. I believe in you!

What does the mascot of a diffuse group of script kiddies with no clear directive have to do with bitcoin?
Isn't the whole idea of a public ledger that we don't have to 'believe' anything?
Wouldn't Sonic the Hedgehog have been a better completely unrelated character to collage onto a Bitcoin T-shirt?
