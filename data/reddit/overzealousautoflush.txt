Yes, I have been doing the same maths. Is mined crypto taxable, if you don't sell?
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:11:40
Taxable as revenue? Or do you only pay on gains after recouping your investment in hardware and electricity?

Thanks for sharing your insights, best of luck to you on your venture!

Did you formally incorporate this co-op? I'm considering setting something up with family that lives in a part of the country with much lower energy prices than where I am.

Dianne Feinstein sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They are investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, among other things. Could it be that they have found a link between the extensive cryptocurency payments from regions beyond to United States citizens, and the sudden spike in ideological fervor during the elections last year?

Glad to see some steady hands here. Everyone is entitled to their own FUD, but when everyone starts talking out of their ass it starts to smell like shit.

This pump and dump crap is the kind of simple penny-ante scheme logic that "small money" comes up with.

I am going to save you some time and tell you none of the exchanges give a fuck about you. ATM fees are the highest of all routes to get Bitcoin. Swallow your pride and get the coin through any way possible. If you do it right (HODL and not pretend as Gordon Gecko) the fees will pay for themselves vs the opportunity cost of waiting to find an alternative (an alternative just as bad or worse than Coinbase) as the prices rise.

Great concept, but how many times can you pivot/rebrand before everyone realizes you don't know what you're doing?

Regulated? As in "you broke the law making billions, pay your fine in millions and say you're sorry". They don't even bother with the "sorry" anymore.

This is great, thank you for taking the time to explain this and teach me something new about how people handle their money in other parts of the world. Cheers.

Had you swallowed your pride and ate the fees on the first go around you would be up 50% on your 3k. You lost $1500 trying to avoid $44.04 in fees.
Learn from your mistake, and you will eventually recoup the $1455.96 you are now agonizing over.

Keep it simple. Timing the market is a fools errand, but if you are going to do it, that is your prerogative. I would further advise someone wanting to "hop on the bandwagon" against this strategy. Anyone who has asked them self the same question at any time has either 1) bought immediately, and are up on their investment 2) waited and bought the same amount of coin for a higher price, and still probably up on their investment. Speaking from experience, you want to be a 1, not a 2.

Now you have my attention. Where do you buy/sell GBTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:03
and Bitcoin ATMs, where available (high fees)

Everyone is having issues with demand at every level of the market. I have been wading through personal and institutional account setup paperwork for months now, it sucks. itBit, for example, finally got back to me after submitting my complete paperwork a MONTH later. They have a line of people and companies out the fucking door all jumping at the chance to buy and trade on their exchanges at 0.1% a pop. During these breakout periods it's going to be hard to do these kinds of quick trades your talking about.
Keep looking for something better, but until then I suggest jumping through whatever hoops you need to in order to get those limits up. BTC will never be this cheap again.

Glad someone finally started a thread about this.

Hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S and Trezor are designed to do the important stuff (PINs and Keys) on the hardware device itself so that even with a compromised PC your coins are safe.

The echo chamber of "PUMP AND DUMP!" Everyone is repeating the same simple theory based on applying the old rules to the new paradigm.

I'm at 7,500 for bank. At which point I was told to "Wait 30 days" for the next increase. 15 days until whatever the next increase is for me.

Has anyone used Binance to send their forked Bcash to buy BTC? Is it as simple as opening a BCC wallet on Binance and sending the Bcash there?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:29
I guess what I'm trying to say is I see no evidence of market manipulation. There is nothing to distinguish incrementally increasing worldwide adoption from the Wall Street boogeyman splashing the pot to explain the recent rise in price.

Because we want to buy a dip so bad we will ourselves into thinking it must crash.

Does anyone have a Bitfinex invitation code? Or can recommend an exchange for selling my BCH and getting some XRP, IOTA, etc? Thanks.

Same, so many possibilities. And we all have not only a front row seat, but we are stakeholders as well.

TLDR: no she didn't.  
Full text of the article, minus sensational headline added by Fortune:
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen called the digital currency bitcoin a “highly speculative asset” that “doesn’t constitute legal tender.”
Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, has surged about 17 times in value this year, prompting caution from central bankers around the world.
“Bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system,” Yellen said Wednesday during a press conference in Washington, appearing to downplay it’s ability to affect wider financial markets. She added that bitcoin is “not a stable store of value.”
New York Fed President William Dudley said last month he would be “pretty skeptical” of bitcoin, adding that it is “not a stable store of value.” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said this month that the fascination with cryptocurrencies “feels more like speculative mania than it has to do with their use” as a form of payment.
Interesting. Yellen says:
“highly speculative asset”  
“doesn’t constitute legal tender”  
“Bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system”  
“not a stable store of value”  
These are objective statements of fact, yet Fortune runs with the clickbait headline:  
'The Fed Chair Just Issued a Stark Warning About Bitcoin'.  
This is but one example of the media stumbling their way through coverage of something they do not understand.  
edit: tl;dr

More secure than keeping them on the exchange, less so than a hardware or paper wallet.
