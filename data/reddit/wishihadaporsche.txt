Every time I buy it takes a shit too.......then it jumps.  I’m not biting.

Yeah agreed, at least my eth profits offset the price rise.  Should’ve bought 3 at 3800

Yeah I need to make it easy so my spouse can get at it if something happens to me.  I was kinda thinking just keep it in coinbase since they are fully insured and a US company (so we have legal rights if something goes sideways).
I worry about a paper wallet getting lost or a little device getting destroyed by kids, etc.....I guess you could put a paper wallet into a safe deposit box.....

I had owned .6 coin when it went nuts in 2017, but never a full coin.  Moved those profits into eth and got out before it crashed.
Wish I had bought at 4K when my heart told me to.
Haven’t bought a wallet yet, was thinking about a Trezor.
So far keeping them on a large US exchange has been fine, but that’s not a good safe strategy.  Sooner or later they will get hacked, everyone does.

I don’t disagree with you, but you are not sharing correct info.
Throwaway account so good luck with social engineering.
Their crypto is privately insured, but not FDIC, and covers everything except for personal account hacks.

I got burned on alt coins so sticking with the big boy for now.
Keeping this one.   If we hit 6k I may buy 2 more so each kid has one to inherit.

Don’t disagree, although at least Coinbase is US based and insured, and almost all of their crypto is stored offline.

Yeah I’d rather FOMO at 5k then last time at 10k
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:52:24
Yeah I’ll probably pick up a trezor and a steel plate for seed words

You're assuming the wallet is owned by Huobi.  Clearly it isn't or they'd have no issue giving you the bitcoin back.

You're mad that you gave someone 1 BTC??  Tough.  Chalk it up to being stupid and move on with life.  That wallet name is probably a scam.
