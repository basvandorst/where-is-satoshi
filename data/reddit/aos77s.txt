Most likely scam or they got mtgox’d wallets funds stolen.

looking purely at numbers its at 6000% up for the year over btc 1400%  Eth has been stagnant for a few days so i would say its either gonna dip soon or climb. only time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:55:45
just hold. im sure by the end of december it will be a $1000 investment.

Yes. the most user friendly way is coinbase with it coming in 3-4 business days. everyway to get it top cash is risky

Well it’s up 10x from last year, so if this next year is 10x again they are looking at 10b. It’s possible.

about an hour ago it was $10,450. couldve bought then. its back up at $11,350
you know if you play it right you could try trading like crypto forex.

congrats, you can remind them this year that they lost a $30,000 gift. :]

Op didn’t come back, been 9hrs. Would assume op is now neck deep in hookers n blow.

it becomes a problem for fiat the moment the government that regulates the fiat has trouble getting their population to continue using fiat. at some point a majority will want to own some amount of bitcoin and with its value always skyrocketing, once you hold enough you technically wouldnt need to work again.

You understand why you just got 50 people downvoting you? Because you said savings and rent. Just leave half in Bitcoin that has already given you thousands % more return than a savings account.

ok now show email headers for ALL EMAILS RECEIVED FROM THEM. not just the ones you're now receiving from the real binance.

$3300 or so im guessing? /napkin math
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:49:01
I have $20 worth :P I wish I could afford to buy more just to hold. I remember doing some mining for a week years ago but I’ve lost the wallet for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:49
RemindMe! 2 weeks

Watching right now, it’s gotta be a bot someone put up.   Unless it’s normal to see nearly the same 15btc range trading on a set price. Just watched it make a $16 spread per btc.

i believe coinbase makes it super easy for someone to get in. its where i buy and sell. Just getting it out to a paper/cold storage wallet needs to be spoken about to those going to coinbase. I don't trust leaving it to some exchange that can pull a mtgox. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:24
sure when BTC hits 1.2m each you can cash out that 0.09 for 108k
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:12:28
tell me, has it looked like a bunch of bot buy and sell orders for you on gdax? i was toying with "day trading" with some LTC and i was getting destroyed. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:23:27
looking at their twitter feed, they disabled iran accounts and arent responding to them. I would guess that they don't have the BTC on hand to cash out all those people. They probably played it like a bank would and have enough reserve on hand to do day to day business but never 100% availability. Community should just halt all interaction with them until they have returned all BTC they owe. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:39:52
but why didnt litecoin fall down while watching? that coin went from $60 to $400 then down to $100 again. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:08:05
I’m sure if they split for 2x it will either be worthless at the start or take half the btc value with it. You can’t just put an instant influx of coins and expect nothing to change on either side. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:06:27
Well is the dollar the same way? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:24:45
Yea just trying to buy it you are asked for a billion forms of identification then some wait period to be verified.
