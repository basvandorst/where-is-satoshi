I like how it starts off with one guy and we don't even know who they are. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:53:29
just like the cheap roasted chickens at Costco.

I was here for this little piece of history.

The next halvening will do it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:34
Good timing dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:47:09
agreed, BTC always slumps over holiday weekends. remember memorial day weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:41:33
Cigarettes have a 1-2 year shelf life. Alcohol never goes bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:15:17
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:40
Yes, They should have sent an email statement at least a couple says in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:59:41
Just bought some more!

The supported Bcash but I’m not sure about any other Forks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:49
Buy small amount every $500 it drops. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:34:28
You’re just salty because you didn’t buy any.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:48:13
In my opinion yes. at least you wouldn’t be buying in at an ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:39:29
Death or Ghodlory!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:10:08
Shorting cryptos is possibly the worst mistake an individual could make. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:27:26
women make 80% of all purchases. That’s a huge user base you are writing off. If anything they are the ones who will really drive this thing home.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:47:00
Can I get $50? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:14
Jesus it's 14250 now
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:00:21
I think It's time to convert to Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:31:27
I sold my Bcash for $300. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:42
It will be the same as what you bought it for. it won’t adjust at all.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:31:51
I won't close my account but i did remove all funds and don't have plans to buy from them again. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:18
Yes, Just sold Bcash and bought some BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:01
Yes, I will continue to buy for every $500 it drops.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:07
Buy the god damn dip. It's almost over. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:10:52
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:42:46
how much would you have if you bought every bottom and sold every top?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:25
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:00:59
you should delete this. You could become a target for someone to hack you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:57
They had to make a move before everyone sells all their Coinbase Bcash after the new year.

Alcohol was involved in this meme. I guarantee it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:46
They should have said what time it would happen down to the minute. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:22
I think 10400 was the bottom on CB
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:06:53

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:27
How can you sell when it goes up every minute.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:25
I have never seen it go up so quickly. This is nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:27:13
shapeshift once it’s it’s available for trade again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:12:52
Smart move, Buy when everyone else is fearful. Worked out great for me when it dropped to $250 a couple years ago.

@_date: 2017-12-24 06:13:52
Dude, if you have more than a $500 in crypto I would highly suggest getting a Hardware wallet. The Nano S is legit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:45
What about building 7?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:09
Monero is doing quite well due to all this news.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:26:15
I think they just hired something like 200 new support agents. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:55

Dude, I was just about to post the same exact thing word for word. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:48:19
I love my Ledger Nano S They support a lot of other coins too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:16
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:21:21
Did you take the paper wallet out to the lake again?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:22
An old coworker of mine now works for them. They are based in SF.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:48
I'm holding now. I have been through much worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:58:41
WOW, I didn't even notice this...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:53
  Nope, BTC can do better than that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:39:09
I gave my coworker a paper wallet with $5 in btc on it a couple years ago, I called him up the other day to see if he still had it. Apparently he lost the $100 during the couple times he had to move. Last time I’m giving anyone a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:00
looks like they had to move now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:15:05
or lose
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:48:52
Damn that worked out well.

Buy a little now and wait with more cash in hand in case it moves lower in the next few days
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:33
BCH will be more centralized and will have worse scaling issues if they ever get to the size BTC is at now. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:41:19
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:34:54
I sold mine at $300

@_date: 2018-08-23 16:33:53
Yep, JP Morgan has been manipulating the price of silver for decades. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:46:54
It's really just Satoshi himself. He is greedy and just wants more BTC
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:47:00
Very good bank, you can also buy stocks through them aswell.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:13:42
Is there a difference if you get 1 bitcoin in many small transfers than 1 transfer? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:43:35
I just completed a one man study. The test subject was myself. Results seem to show there is a correlation to owning bitcoin and drinking heavily.
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:29:22
Also, when transfering btc out of cryptsy you will also have to click on a confirmation email before it is processed.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:58:08
I did the same thing and have secured the memory card at a backup location.
@_date: 2014-01-02 07:11:26
The information would be a string of ones and zeros in a thin circular line around the disk.

Just dont go comatose for 61 day. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:22:12
If i generate a wallet offline and deposit BTC into it, how does the private key know that it belongs to that specific wallet? 
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:44:01
Great answer, Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:33:49
I put all my stock on dogpile.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:36:15
If you don't mind me asking, how did it get stolen?
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:25:57
For the short term Yes.

@_date: 2014-09-09 06:40:30
Companies like Airbnb want to have the users credit card on file, that way they can charge them if they leave a mess or stuff goes missing. I'm interested to see how they could have %100 Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:18:00
Bitcoin: The most advanced technological currency: store it on a piece of paper. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:07:55
Nothing to worry about here.
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:57:53
Nope, Just bought some more now. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:15:29
I have been using Coinbase for years and never had any issues. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:24:50
Seems resonable to me. I guess it just depends on what people quantify as being rich. 1 million? 20 million?  
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:12:16
Everything good that happens to you as a negafive impact on someone else, just found twenty bucks, someone lost twenty, you get a great new job, someone else is still unemployed, so on and so on

Stop talking to this guy. You will be the one that gets scammed. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:11:31
All previous bitcoin bubbles have not followed this pattern.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:35:38
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:02:50
It's worth it if you are fast enough. Just be sure to buy back in and only do this trade once. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:09:07
Well, it does skyrocket and crash. But that doesn't mean it won't go back up higher. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:45:36
Hope you didn't sell just yet. The fun is just starting. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:49:22
It represents a predetermined amount of time.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:39:32
I would wait a a few days to a week and if it starts to pickup quickly again it could be a very good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:29:41
jealous much? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:57:59
it will show you how much the price has risen and fallen over 1 min, 30 min or  1 day. and not just the average price over that same period of time.
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:17:30
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:00:15

I did, now I only go boating with my Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:54:26
How funny would it be if Andreas was actually Satoshi and we are sending him BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:39:29

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:02:15

@_date: 2017-11-15 14:04:28
I regret not buying at $8. Dwolla was giving me issues so I put it off a couple years.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:29:42
I agree that another recession is coming the I believe the stock market is due for a big correction in the next couple years. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:43:28
At the end of 2013. Diversified half into Eth and a couple other alt coins. I would have been better off just holding BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:38:36
I went overboard with my paper wallet and it got soaked. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:32:10
agreed and also some Monero.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:32:57
If? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:21:43
I’m sure the same would have happened to me too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:53:47
I sold my BCH for BTC around $300.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:49:30
Happy now? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:41:43
Yes, it can also store a handfull of other crypto-currencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:25:20
If not worse since it was a conscious decision.

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:35:26
As did I
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:53:40
for any amount of crypto over $1000 I believe you should store on a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:15

@_date: 2017-09-13 16:58:34
Looks like the bottom was $3800
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:42:01
I just bought more.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:28:08
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:18:30
yes, but wait for the next dip.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:14:47
Yes, Sell it.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:09:30
$3600 and then back up

Get nicotine patches. everyday cut them just a little smaller. eventually you can cut one in 1/4th 1/8ths etc to use 1 for multiple day. if you get a craving, just tack on another 1/8 of a patch. after a few months you will have quit without even knowing it. You can do it. message me if you need support.

@_date: 2017-05-04 14:35:25
I guess it depends on how long you want to Hodl for and to never sell for less than what you paid. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:03:45
Well that turned out to be bad advice.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:56:15

I just got mine today. Thanks BitttBurger! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:27:08
Yes, But don't buy more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:30:48
could be replaced by ETH 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:03:49
Yes, I would recommend 50% BTC and %50 ETH or somewhere around there. Just think that if you now had the cash value of your BTC in hand, what would you buy now?

For my first purchase on coinbase it is taking 7 days to process because it is my first transaction, after that it will be much faster. So for your first transaction dont test it out with a really small order. You will be waiting a week before you can get more.
