Yeah... I "secure erase" my drives for security before I put them away. That $1 of 0.5 bitcoin I unrecoverably deleted in now worth about $8,000. I don't have a well paid job so $8K would make a big difference. On the plus side my old hard drives are "secure" so I've got that going for me. Bitcoin has certainly taught me to make peace with my past decisions. Congrats OP.

Give the calculations in an encrypted form with some sort of realistic parameters for the outcome. Because people can't decrypt the calculations the probability of any fake outcome being within the acceptable parameters of answers would go a long way to stop cheaters. Plus these could easily be duplicated ie checked by other "nodes" the network. Due to the nature of the sums it would probably be ASIC resistant and therefore lend itself to decentralisation. The transfers of currency could still be done by a verifiable blockchain like bitcoin but the majority of coin earnings would be done by the "proof of contribution". It would obviously not be perfectly efficient ( both duplication and encryption of the calculations providing overheads ) but it would be significantly less inefficient than bitcoin. 
The electrical inefficiency of bitcoin may well become an "attack vector" for governments to close exchanges. And yes governments can't completely stop bitcoin but if all the exchanges in the west stopped it would be a significant blow.

**My idea is "proof of contribution" - contributing to medical and scientific research would earn you coins** - Things like "folding at home" a protein folding simulation for medical research or Bionic etc there are loads of scientific needs for distributed computer power. The actual maths to maintain the bitcoin network is quite small but made artificially difficult. With the science projects it would be used for actual worth while computational work. Using the computational power of the network for medical or scientific research would be far more energy efficient that doing pointlessly difficult sums. Yes it's technically more difficult to implement but would probably help increase acceptance of cryptocurrencies and nullify some of the criticism. 
Also with regard to the meme pic - the activities described use as much power as they need to so they can complete the task. Bitcoin uses far more that is necessary due to artificially induced difficulty increases.
