You can only take a net 3k loss against your other taxable income. 
All of your gains and losses are netted together, so if you had 10k in gains but 15k in losses during the year, you’d only be able to write of 3k this year, but the the remaining 2k can be carried forward to offset gains in future years. 
I’m a CPA, but I don’t do taxes, so this is super simplified and potentially not wholly correct. Really your supposed to keep track of wash trading, which nullifies any potentially recognizable gains if they were traded in the same 30-day window.

Most big exchanges probably fake some amount of volume, but aren’t too blatant, namely: bitfinex, Binance and huobi. 
The only ones I’d trust being mostly legit are: coinbase, bitstamp, kraken and bitmex
Last I looked at CMC, about a month ago, I couldn’t tell you who 25 of the top 30 exchanges by volume were - and these were nonexistent a year or so ago.
Any exchange HQ’d in the US or Europe is probably legit. The Asian and money-laundering island ones are definitely more suspect.

Ehh don’t be so sure about that.

What causes the stock market to move up and down?
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:22:23
I’ll give you a hint, it happened in October.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:56:33
If there was a secret, no one would share it. 
Markets can behave both rationally and irrationally. 
There are algos producing high frequency trades that involve complex computations. 
You can get into technicals (ie changes in price action and volume) or you can learn fundamentals. Neither are simple or scientific and if anyone tries to sell you on that they’re a charlatan. 
If you don’t have the time or inclination to do either, your best bet is to buy and sell long term.

There isn’t “the exchange”. 
Fees don’t change the price. Coinbase has high fees, but is probably the best noob exchange. 
BLX/ brave new liquid coin index tracks the exchange averages, but is only updated daily. 
You should probably note that Bitfinex/ BFX trades consistently 1-2% higher than other exchanges due to the ‘tether premium’. 
Tether (USDT) is supposed to equal $1 USD, but there’s a lot of speculation that there aren’t actual reserves to back the $2B in tether, so tether is discounted relative to the USD, kinda. 
USDT is known as a ‘stable coin’ because it’s supposed to be pegged to USD. There are others too, like USDC, which is the Poloniex issued stable coin (which is owned by Goldman Sachs, and I trust relatively). 
The point is, be careful what you’re looking at for prices.

Coinbase is the  exchange on cmc for btc 24 hour volume and is undoubtedly legit. A year ago, it was always in the top 10.

Most cryptocurrencies are more centralized than the global banking cartels. 
Bitcoin might be the exception but it still has to prove it has intrinsic value. 
As productivity becomes more synonymous with computing power, it may prove its case, but it’s still to be determined all while being heavily undermined by the intrinsic value of aircraft carriers and a nuclear arsenal that backs the good faith and fair dealing of the almighty dollar.

I’ll probably get downvoted for saying this but cash app or coinbase are the two best ways for new users to get in, although I think they may be limited to Americans. Their fees kinda suck, but it’s better than fucking up and losing everything. Also, coinbase pro or whatever they’re calling it is sans fees I believe.
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:01:54
Yes you can buy on the apps and then transfer to a hardware/ software wallet or exchange. 
Both are legitimate and don’t pose any threats, other than the normal user errors of using sensitive information. 
If you’re concerned about your account getting hacked you can always disconnect or remove cards and accounts after purchases, but coinbase (at least) requires multiple levels of authentication (2FA, SMS, and email).

If you can make the minimum loan payments work in your current budget, YOLO. 
I’d set parameters for recognizing profits though. 
For example:
On 50% return, recognize 10% and pay off, (on $10k + 50% = $15k x 10% = $1.5k) 
On 100% return, recognize 20% and pay off, another 1.9k, etc. 
And don’t forget the big bad tax man
Overall, bad idea, but seems like your mind is set.

Per the dailywire, it’s the SPLC. 
Anyone or group that isn’t firmly on the left or walk the PC tightrope is subject to being labeled an extremist or hate group by the SPLC. 
The exception seems to be leftist groups that criticize Jews/ Israel. 
Leftists force their views on everyone, which is why people on the right aggregate anywhere that isn’t overly moderated. 
Barring t_d, any highly moderated sub on Reddit is full of leftists and their ideologies. 
Traditionally, free speech has been a liberal view point, but classical liberals are typically considered right wingers now because of how far left the Overton window has shifted.

It’s only fallacious to the extent that you assume there can be no assumptions, which as human beings is inherently false. Generalizations are biologically built into us - they’re a survival mechanism. 
People have an inherent need for things like food, water, and shelter. Commodities have intrinsic value because they can be used in objectively beneficial ways - like surviving. 
Outside of psychopaths and communist, everyone agrees that living is good or at least worthwhile, for example.

I think at the upper ends of the intelligence spectrum, there’s a positive correlation with certain types of mental illness. 
Lots of crazy smart people (say IQs over 150) we’re both crazy and smart. 
Im not saying Desantis is in this tier, but it’s not impossible. 
Some pop culture examples are:
Nikola Tesla, Fredrich Nietzsche, Isaac Newton, John Nash, Ted Kaczynski* 
*feels weird putting him in with great contributors to civilization considering he was a mass murderer, but the guy was a genius
Anyways, all of those guys were borderline insane and all but the last were some of the greatest minds to have ever existed.
