This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:29:48
You do realize that it is those average people you deem not worthy that has been propelling the price of BTC right
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:49:07
Seriously, is this allowed? It's blatant self-profitting.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:11:03
To be fair though, a 50% crash after a 1000% gain is more like a 500% crash.....
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:52:36
Where are the fcking dips???? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:27
Any issues with customs or oversea shipping?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:37
FCK it's already back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:43
Should I buy more guys? I already invested the full amount that I am willing to lose. But it is just so tempting...
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:31:53
And that's bad because??? I would love for the price to dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:54
Not selling.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:38:33
If you don't mind me asking, how much do you have in your bank account and how has it grown?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:10
Got in at 14,356, think it can go lower?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:51:56
Any specific reason that it's better?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:35
Sounds like u still dig her dawg. Get ur feelings in check before u wreck.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:21:59
He don't got shit
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:27:57
Physical address or email?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:00
god damn it. But I needed a voice of reason. Thanks. Holding strong but no more buying. Zero or the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:58
Why does it always rebound after hitting 17k? I want to buy a real dip not this weak shit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:49:54
Fuck off leech
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:40
I keep on telling myself to stop buying but this is just making it too fcking tempting
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:42:51
A few thousand dip will have buyers sure. But how many of the newcomers do you think will not panic if the price crashes to under 3k? All the articles and comments will say how bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:43:46
Thanks! Look like that's the way to go then!

Bitcoin can't be confiscated. A 35 year old neckbeard with a ponytail can.
@_date: 2018-05-09 12:46:55
Nonono he only provided the means for drug dealers to function and expand their network. He's a saint.

Where did Ross hide the dough?
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:10:45
You would do very well in a casino.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:33:27
You kid, but this is as accurate as any expert predictions 
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:00:41
Exactly. These guys are not innocent.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:11:10
Did it drop 300% last year? Genuine question.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:10:14
I'm feeling fine despite investing at $12.5k because I invested what I was perfectly willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:28:56
Got it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:04:13
They probably didn't deserve this, but they probably deserved something. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:08:08
What are the circumstances of your prediction that it will go to 30k?
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:36:24
And 100% more people are selling than buying.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:13:21
20k to 6k
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:11:19
Research can be valid and biased at the same time.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:05:19
The MOON
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:29:11
No, just less convincing 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:52:14
Holy fck. If you are not a finance professor, it is a damn waste.
