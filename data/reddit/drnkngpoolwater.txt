Haha that and ‘HOW DO I BUY BITCOIN?’
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:54:22
that’s the greatest thing i’ve ever seen lol.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:25:28
no but who is in picture and why did he say that?
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:22:58
wait what is this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:36:40
I would sell most and retire but definitely keep a few hundred in. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:55:42
The money skeleton is evil.

“Back in my day that car cost 50000 bitcoins”
@_date: 2019-03-02 11:22:57
hmm pretty cool. I’ll use this in the future. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:20:37
shit i hope it does. good time to buy!
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:09:33
400k is not much lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:45:08
horrible article. I can't believe he said scarcity is bad. As if the ability to print money out of thin air has been a good thing throughout history 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:24:39
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:06:15
There are limits to how much you can withdraw at one time.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:35:18
Haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:20:27
Mister edgy over here
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:41:04
31 comments and not one of you agreed with peter in any way lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:00:32
Coinbase has a send function. Just send it to the address of your choice 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:48:25
Curious, how much was the pizza back then in BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:36:18
300 are worth just over a million. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:42:05
I know what to do, hodl!
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:23:19
If it sounds too good to be true..........
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:27:39
Really? 300k in two months? How? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:27:10
I'd assume he sold some. Obviously. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:09:06
Seems legit!
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:26:14
Smart guy. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:00:48
Damn so now that bitcoin you spent  is worth almost half a million
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:59:13
Lol good advice.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:01:32
Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:24:36
Sweet. I'll be in Milwaukee this weekend and may check one out. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:52:45
He said some things that make a lot of sense and even championed blockchain. It's easy to cherry pick your argument and only hear what you wanna hear when you've got alot invested in cryptos. His main point was that gold is a physical property that, although not as speculative or exciting as bitcoin, holds its value over time. Gold has been valuable for centuries, bitcoin has been valuable for what? Like 4 years now or so. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:49:15
It not out of the question. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:20:44
Yea, unless you work somewhere where they won't catch on to your power usage, it's pretty much impossible for the average person to do at a low cost. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:21:51
So only millennials had public educations? What a stupid fucking comment. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:27:52
Anythings possible 
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:15:29
You've got a lot of catching up to do, son
@_date: 2019-10-06 17:13:00
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:41:45
lol. Old news how? I never saw this story anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:53
don’t buy Netflix, they said. Streaming?! That’ll never take off! 
don’t buy amazon, they said. Online shopping?! That’ll never take off! We shop at stores and malls!
don’t buy Apple, they said. It’s an overvalued computer company!
dont buy google, they said. How will they make money off search?! Don’t trust those Silicon Valley nerds!
And on and on, echoes thru history. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:39:16
quite the insight. interesting. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:46:06
Spend 15-20k. Be careful with your money. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:43:12
I’d rather have the bitcoin, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:43:33
Pretty sure you can’t cash it out in its entirety unless you have a Mark Cuban type guy who has a million bucks in cash. She’ll have to part it out in increments. 
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:03:47

Weird this song was on the radio as I saw this thread
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:55:05
It's a bubble. Just like in the late 90s there were a lot of pointless tech companies that were valued high but couldn't turn a profit if their life depended on it. We have too many kids from the iPhone generation who don't remember that tho and think their coin is gonna change the world. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:59:15
I’m literally shaking right now!
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:04:17
I applaud them. Fuck credit cards. Fuck them all. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:24:47
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:22:06
Didn’t this guy say bitcoin was a fad just a few months ago? Fuck this guy. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 04:18:20
you didn't say the magic word 
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:22:44
yes. revealing his, or hers, identity would compromise bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:46:10
didn’t wanna offend anyone, okay.
