Which city? There is quite a difference in crypto-awareness between wall-street and main-street, Berlin and Plauen, Paris and LaChapelle, Beijing and Chindou... 
Anyhow, the point is: it is along way to the top, if you want to rock'n hodl.

Same here. I bought two at 200 and sold 1 when it was 400. The other one is fun but now evenly distributed over 20 coins.
My gut told me back then to buy 10 bitcoin, but my enlightened mind argued the risks are too high... since March this year I doubt my mind regularly ;)

I think he never was a bad guy. The ring just changed him over time and I think this is where the metaphor ends. 
Instead: To the power of saurons ring are all those hooked, who want to keep power over the monetary system, aka governments, central banks, banks and in a broader sense probably large multinational companies.
The cryptocurrency community is IMHO more like the fellowship of the ring with very different people of all walks of life gathering to fight for, build or take part in a better future for all of middle earth. Saurons might must be destroyed for the peoples of this earth to be free. In our case the ring will be melted in the fire of cryptocurrencies. So the circle closes right there and the picture replacing the ring with a bitcoin  might be an omen for things to come.
Just everybody in the fellowship be careful that the power of the token does not corrupt you and keep your protective gear up, because the evil eye has not focused upon us yet and the armies of sauron are mighty and have not started moving...
