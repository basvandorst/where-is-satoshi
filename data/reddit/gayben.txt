I broke through all his bullshit and subtext to give you this TL;DR.
Was the MtGox code to blame?

Thanks :)

It's actually clever, you'd buy one gpu and it'd be slow, so you'd go back and buy more powerful ones.

When will we get family support for people who die in car crashes? or commit suicide? or natural causes?
Clearly families only need support if they die of a well known disease.

Except ebay uses and owns paypal. That will not change.

Yeah It sounded right at the time.

I'm sure they will happily screw you in a currency of your choosing.

Dear Gabe, is this website legit? 
Lazy ass redditor.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:20:13
So now would be a good time for a newbie to get in and start grinding?

Owner of the pizza place must be kicking himself now eh.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:11:22
Yeah fuck america.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:24:01
Yes that would be a fantastic sponsor sell out. Everyone loves that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:22:59
fanboy much?
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:44:47
Yeah that does sound like something your wife would say.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:00:29
If that looks legit, maybe you shouldn't be mining coins.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:51:01
"high" you are talking 10-20p per transaction. Refusing to accept cards will cost you more money than not accepting saves.
Charge 50p to use a card like everyone else.

If you need to ask....
Wait for the Nigerian prince to validate it.
Rule of thumb, never trust anything offered that you never asked for.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:38:52
To be clear i mean i bet hes really happy.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:52:55
Charge for it. Like everyone else does.
If the customer is paying the trans fee, you are not losing money.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:13:00
I cannot confirm or deny that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:55:35
But you know it's cool to bash on windows tho right.
You are right and millions are wrong.

Am I missing a reference here?

If linux was as popular as windows, it would be exploited just as much. Only you would have thousends of different distros and no unified updating service to fix them.
So fuck linux tbh.

Why people are getting naked for money, because none of you will figure it out.
