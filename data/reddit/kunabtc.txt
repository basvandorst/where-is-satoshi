Negative fee comes from desire of the seller to get cash usd. There is no other way to get cash usd for btc apart from dealing with local traders. Sometimes the demand is weak and supply is strong. So seller pays for example 5% commission (gets 95 USD for his 100 worth of btc) out of 5 buck 2 goes to trader and 3 goes to buyer. So buyer actually buys for 97 usd. rare occasion but possible. This is all due to strict capital controls and lack of trust in local currency.

The market is more or less balanced here. If not, than traders know the way how to get access to exchanges for extra liquidity. At the moment we can easily export bitcoins in exchange for cash USD

Hey. Its Michael from the article. On average the fees are from as low as negative 3% to  +12-15%, and we are talking about btc-e exchange price. The cheapest option is always the one without a bank in the middle (cash). The most expensive would be fully automated service at the ATM. Commission also depends on the currency that you trade in. Hryvna would be more expensive, cash USD the cheapest. But trading in cash is not exactly legal, so you have to be careful.  In terms of liquidity - i can get you almost any amount. I personally know a few local bitcoin millioners (in usd terms of course). And forget AML/KYC crap :)
