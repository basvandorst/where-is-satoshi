Well, I'd argue the debate is to reach a consensus before the fork so that the outcome is known ahead of time. If roughly half the people want one and half want the other and the fork happens then this would be what happens. There can be a little preparation ahead of time, like exchanges getting ready and wallet services preparing to support both forks or one or the other.

No, there's no need to prevent that, nor would it make sense to do so. Merchants/exchanges/etc. would just tell you which they accept and which they don't. Perhaps they'll ask for a TX in both, perhaps just the one they have chosen. It will be messy, which will encourage the "economic consensus" to quickly choose one over the other.

Because of our long history of debased currencies, and non-stop macroeconomic shenanigans, Argentines tend to be well aware of what things can go wrong with currencies, as opposed to the US where people think, "Meh, everything seems to work." So I think Bitcoin naturally appeals to Argentines. There is a lot of interest down here, but not much for official infrastructure-- i.e. we have no official exchange with bank integration (though one is apparently on the way), no Bitpay-like service, etc. But people make due with localbitcoins and informal exchanges through facebook, etc. We have several restaurants now that accept bitcoin. Does that answer your question?

A couple of thoughts: 
First of all, tragedy of the commons doesn't apply here. That's about the rational individual use (or abuse, or overuse) of shared resources in a way that is inefficient or irrational for the collective. Look at 
Second, what you're really getting at is the classic "bitcoin's value goes up therefore it will go down" pop-economics line of argument one runs into so much when reading about bitcoin. In Keynsian economics, Deflation is regarded as bad, but not because people simply hoard money and don't spend. The problem with deflation is that wages (and prices and debt), tend to be nominally fixed ("sticky") and therefore can't adjust downward (nominally) as a currency appreciates. This i what causes a recession. However, this is not the case with bitcoin: no wages are set nominally in bitcoin, neither are prices, and debt in bitcoin is negligible (just a few scams on btcjam).

I don't find the "he was talking about his past employer" line compelling. He is quoted as saying (confirmed by the cops, and him): 


Who says "It's been turned over to other people; they are in charge now" when they mean to say they are no longer employed in a company? That doesn't make sense. You'd say, "I no longer work there, and I can't talk about it." You wouldn't make a "mistake" and make the more precise "turned-over; in charge" statement by accident, no matter how badly you speak English. 
Also, the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto comes out to say "I'm not Dorian" right at this moment is suspicious. He never came out to say "I'm not XXX" when numerous other people were reported as being Satoshi. I think it's plausible Dorian posted that to try to get the heat off of him.

What does it mean to "get" something? To understand it, not write dumb noobish false statements, and to comment on the potential it has. Examples of not getting it:
1. "Bitcoin is just for drugs and pedophiles."
2. "No one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and at any moment he could take everyone's money and run."
3. "Users claim Bitcoin is cryptographically secure, but several high-profile heists have show it's not"
Examples of getting it:
1. Mentioning smart contracts.
2. "It would be feasible to push Bitcoin and similar initiatives underground but it would also be a wasted opportunity."
3. "It is a challenge to the banking system and may allow the quick and cheap exchange – and transfer of ownership – not only of currencies but also of other assets, goods and services. It fixes a fundamental gap in the internet."
4. "Bitcoin solves this for currencies – it provides a method for the effective transfer of ownership. Once a Bitcoin is handed to someone else, the first holder cannot spend it again. If the same kind of transfer were achieved for other digital items, ownership would be meaningful."
5. All of Marc Andreessen's article in the NYT

Absolutely. People need to understand that when systems are artificially protected from shocks, it makes them more vulnerable to eventual bigger shocks (think banking, or industries protected from competition from imports). Bitcoin right now is constantly being rocked by huge shocks (hacking, goxing, negative main stream media attention, technical problems like the growing blockchain, competition from alcoins, government attacks, etc., etc.) It doesn't mean Bitcoin WILL survive all these shocks, but being antifragile does mean that every time it does survive it becomes more resistant. 
In the book Antifragile, Taleb defines antifragility as having a larger upside than downside from disorder. Bitcoin defines this: 
Potential downside- a few million early adopters lose some paper profits.
Potential upside- change the world, lift billions out of poverty by bringing them into world commerce, reintroduce liberty to billions, fight back against corrupt governments, etc. etc.

Well, the standard explanation is that they need the official value of the peso to be strong so that dollar repayments on debt remain low in the peso-denominated budget, so as to not crowd out the domestic spending which they rely on to stay in power. As for if they know how stuff works, usually I'd say cynically that yes they do but their interest is in maintaining their power, not in best practices; however, the new Finance Minister, Kicilof, is a self-described marxist and longtime critic of all established economics, who says stuff like printing more pesos doesn't cause inflation (and also entered three months ago promising not to do any sudden moves in economic policy), so one must entertain the possibility that they are simply ignorant or deluded.

While the USD is inflationary, this is a gross misrepresentation of the decrease in purchasing power of the USD (why exaggerate if the truth is bad enough?)

You're being (or trying to be) overly technical. It's not a straw man argument. I not only accepted his 41% figure, I also made his point stronger by mentioning you could say the drop was much much larger. All I'm doing is giving context to the numbers. A couple whimsical examples of what giving context to numbers might look like:
1. If I told you my business boosted sales 30% from December to January, it sounds impressive. But it would be less impressive if I told you every year before the Dec/Jan sales boost was 80%. 
2. "The temperature has gone from 30 deg C today at noon to 10 deg C now at midnight; at this rate by tomorrow at midnight it'll be -30 deg C!" --------&gt; "Not likely; here's a graph showing normal daily temperature fluctuations to give you some context".

I wasn't making a value judgement on whether off-chain txs are good or bad, or whether there's a risk of centralization, counter party risk and hidden FRB. All I'm saying is the economics of it and its effect on the value of bitcoin is the same whether the exchange happens on chain, or on coinbase, or even if you hand over your 25 BTC Casascius coin over to a friend in exchange for a car (also an off-chain tx). What matters (economically speaking) is that a trade occurred using the currency.

The reasons people stated below are correct, but also, as he stated in some of his responses to questions on twitter, he doesn't personally own bitcoins out of respect for the partners of his firm: 
"Correct, I do all tech investing through my firm to eliminate risk of conflicts and cherrypicking with our Limited Partners."  ( 
I think this is commendable from a corporate governance standpoint, but I do believe, as others have stated, that he's betting on the technology/payment network, and not so much on a particular currency. This decision is in keeping with that investment strategy.

First of all, if you had to return 1.12 BTC back, it would cost you, by definition, exactly the same as in the 0.8 scenario: 1000USD. So, no, there's no additional cost to you.
I agree that it would be awesome if such a hedging vehicle existed (it will, but probably not for a couple years at least). However, if you do this, and promise customers to return their original BTC amount regardless of the current exchange, you'd be setting yourself up for some crazy crazy financial shenanigans.

Again, that argument devolves into "the value of bitcoin is going up therefore it will go down," which is ridiculous. I think we could sort out the argument better if we defined some terms you used:
1. What does it mean for Bitcoin (the resource/commodity) to "benefit"? (That it's value go up? That it becomes more well known? That its value stabilize? That it replace one or more country's fiat currency? Increasing the number of merchants that adopt it?)
2. "Irrational for the collective." What is rational for the collective? Who is included in the "collective" (all humans? Humans in countries with bad currencies/governments? Bitcoin holders? Bitcoin users?)
These are serious questions, I'm not trolling. Because "benefit" could easily be taken to mean "become more valuable", which would mean that "holding in hopes that the price will go up" would actually mean personal incentives are aligned with "the collective's". 
Look, my opinion on Bitcoin price is simple: This is a startup currency, the likes of which the world has never seen. It's most bullish scenario with widespread world adoption would probably mean a value of around $1,000,000 per bitcoin (or one us cent per satoshi, $0.01/sat). But let's say the best case scenario is $100,000 per coin, and that it either succeeds or fails ($0, no value). Thus the market now implicitly thinks the probability of success is $800/$100,000, or 0.8%. Some of us bulls think the probability is much higher, say 20 to 60% chance of success. Thus it is perfectly rational to hold bitcoin. But a funny thing happens as people hold bitcoin and their net worth increases tremendously: they become wealthier, and as they become wealthier, their desires drive them to spend that wealth to obtain things they desire (trips, Tesla Model S's, nicer dinners, new clothes, new computers, patio furniture.). This is why we see transaction volume spike when the price spikes and bitpay report higher payment volume when the price is spiking, even though the Paradox of Thrift might imply people would hoard more in those times: people become wealthier and they exhibit human-like traits, namely, wanting and buying shit when they can afford it.

Your argument that DOGE is easier to get than BTC (which I don't believe-- please enlighten me as to how that's possible), is probably **only** true in the US of A. Worldwide, you really mean to tell me DOGE is easier to get with fiat than BTC? That's laughable.

*Careful what you wish for*? Your decision won't define bitcoin. Under previous narrow definitions of currency (written, or agreed upon, or adopted, before bitcoin was thought to be possible), bitcoin already doesn't fit neatly. To this I say, who gives a flying satoshi?
Here's where you stand: 
**You're a retailer. You may gain some customers from a newly rich (or wealthier) segment of the population if you accept this funky new payment system. These are savvy users-- you make them agree before hand that returns will be processed for the USD amount because they are buying a USD-price-denominated product in a USD-denominated economy. No one will complain. End of story.**

To avoid the de-facto BTC exchange problem, the return must be made by the same method as the payment, which is *exactly* what you currently do with credit cards (otherwise I could use you, and every retailer, as a de-facto creditcard advance system with zero fees and lower APRs.)
I see from your responses that you consider processing returns at the current BTC exchange rate to somehow "admit" that bitcoin isn't a currency (from above: *"This would be an acknowledgement that we don't see BTC as a currency because we won't be exchanging in BTC, but rather using it as a form of payment, like a Credit-Card or gift card. Are we saying that BTC is not a currency?"*)
But who cares? Since when do retailers have to weigh in on philosophical or academic issues? 
I'm annoyed by the "is bitcoin a currency" discussion because it's trying to fit an old definition on something completely new (if you don't modify the definition of "currency" then the answer is NO, and changes exactly didly squat for bitcoin). But in the context of whether or not to accept bitcoin as a retailer it's beyond stupid. To accept paypal, do I have to weigh in on whether a dollar balance on paypal is equal to a dollar in hand? (I live in argentina and there is a VAST difference between those two). No, it's irrelevant. Especially since customers are well aware that returns are processed using the same payment method as the original payment (cash for cash, credit card for credit card, etc.).

Fantastic passive aggressiving. 
I may have given you the impression I grew up with the American system, but I didn't. I grew up using the metric system in Argentina. Feet/miles/etc make no sense. 
Bits makes sense. It's 100x the minimum unit, just like Dollars and Euros, and avoids having a base unit that includes a metric prefix. 
But hey, tell you what: Grab a camera, walk out into the street, show the first 10 people you see the letter µ (greek "mu") and ask them what that is. If just two out of the ten say it's mu and that it stands for micro, and that micro is 1 one millionth, then I'll just over to your side. Hell, I might be willing to make it 2 in 100.

"Well, BTC stands for bitcoin, it's the original unit of the currency. µ is micro, which is one-millionth in SI notation." "so I get 200 one-millionths for 1 dollar?" "yes" "Okay, send it over" "There you go!" "Wait, what's XUB?" "Oh, well, we call it µBTC, but that's 4 characters and the international system works on three letter codes, but U and B are reserved, so it has to start with X" "Fuck you, give me my dollar back"

Hi, thanks for the post. 
A lot of the tax advice here recommends using a consistent pricing method (I was thinking of using Coindesk's price index). But does that mean I just replace the CDPI for the actual price of each transaction? Or if I bought on Coinbase, do I put the coinbase price and then if I sold on localbitcoins, do I put the actual price I sold at? Or just use the corresponding CDPI on the day of each of those txs?
EDIT: Sorry for the confusing wording. I'm tired.

There are maybe 10 million total that have even a fraction of a bitcoin, and much less than a million (maybe 200-500k) that are active users or have significant (read: more than US$1000) holdings. Is that your basis for criticizing bitcoin? That it's not widespread enough yet? What's the logic of that? "Such and such service doesn't have a 100 million users, therefore it will never work". By that logic nothing has ever worked, nor should anyone ever try to bring anything new to market ever unless they can start with 100M users.

You could talk about the current value of btc in terms of tomatoes, or tons of wheat, pounds of aluminum, a basket of goods (à la CPI) or whatever you want, but it's impractical. It's just a shortcut to use USD, because despite it's steadily decreasing value, by design it's a pretty stable measure of value. So ~$100 today is the the same as ~$100 in two months. That can't be said for tomatoes, wheat, aluminum, pesos, etc.

I'm no expert, but I imagine it will have to be a modification to the POW algorithm (read: hard fork), that makes it so that a miner could steal the block once they find the solution. I think I read somewhere that someone came up with a framework for this. Of course, any solution that doesn't require a hardfork would be preferable for this (as this modification will probably lead to all-out war between users and pools). 
Essentially, it would make it so you'd have to trust the pool, thus destroying the ability to create ad-hoc worldwide mining pools between parties that don't know each other, while maintaining the ability for a miner to pool all his asics together.

Guys (and gals), this is amazing! Finally a Bitcoin bear is willing to put his money where his mouth is. I think this is fantastic and I commend the OP. 
Also, don't kid yourselves. I'm an absolute to-the-moon bitcoin bull, but this bet is risky as fuck. Bitcoin has wild swings and has been down on a 365 day rolling basis for several months in its history before, despite its average 1000% yearly growth (and that's not considering the fact that it won't just have to be the same price, but likely 15-30% higher to keep up with BH). So even if bitcoin goes to the moon, it's entirely conceivable to lose this bet. Again, I commend OP for a well thought out and classy bet. 
One thing I'd say, is that though I find it gracious to offer press coverage or anonymity, OP, this bet HAS to be public. Otherwise, as others have said, it's empty trolling (as far as we know there are plenty of other people short bitcoin right now and not announcing it). 
Having said all that, if I were rolling in dollars or btc, I'd take this bet. I guess I'll take a piece if a credible pool is formed.

Can you please drop that dismissive condescending bullshit tone? I've done nothing but write respectfully to you and explain my arguments clearly. Does that not entitle me to at least not being treated like an 8 year old? How often do you even get respectful debate partners here? Usually you just get downvoted and that's it. Geez.
Back to the point. Yes excluding popular addresses because the point is to find useful metrics. A metric that is filled with 50% spam is not useful (especially when the amount of that spam changed dramatically over the course of the year you're trying to analyze). Thus excluding popular addresses. (If you were my boss and I told you I'm overworked because I get 1000 emails per day, but then it turns out that 990 of those I immediately delete because they are spam and only 10 I actually have to write responses to, in the future you'd want me to report the number of real emails, not the inflated spam-filled one, right? If my total emails went down to 700, but 50 of those are ones I have to respond to, isn't there information there that is getting burried behind a seeming 30% drop in the total number of emails?)
Plus you dismiss the very thing that should give you hope for bitcoin adoption: "increasing merchant adoption has just given people that were spending coins on gambling an outlet to spend coins". WOW! Actual legal goods and services sales replacing gambling and silk road traffic is a huge positive! Not a dismissive negative! (Although this isn't true of gambling... just-dice has 500M+ bets in 6 months of operation, so some of that traffic is just going off chain). 
But fine, I get it, you think excluding popular addresses is just some bullshit way of hiding an unfavorably flat trend line and keep the faithful believing. But if you *must* ignore everything I said above (USD transaction volume, etc.) and focus on number of transactions, I like this guy's article and reasoning better:

Unsurprisingly for you, I'm sure, even though I like his argument better than yours, I still don't find it persuasive. In fact, I find it downright encouraging for bitcoin. First of all, I find the first and third graph almost trivial. The second graph is the most interesting: he's trying to calculate the velocity of money in bitcoin. Two interesting things about this: 
1. He finds BTC velocity is close to USD's M1 historical velocity!!! Holy shit. This is super interesting in and of itself. I see no obvious reason why it should be and find it really interesting that it's the same as the most successful currency out there. [This is worthy of study just because it's fascinating. I'd have to see what the velocity of money is for other fiat currencies. How much variation is there? Do they trend toward this number? etc.]
2. It's FLAT! Just like you argue above with number of transactions (yes, all of them!), he says the fact that it's flat is bad ("proves bitcoin is a bubble", as the title says). My reaction is entirely different: the fact that as bitcoin has surged 1000% to 5000% per year over the course of 3.5 years that velocity of money has remained flat is unbelievably encouraging. It means bitcoin values seem to be grounded in some sort of reality as bitcoin derives its value from its transferability. Also his graph is really interesting because the two big spikes in velocity seem to be leading indicators of upcoming crashes (late april, early december). Might be worth looking into as a speculator/trader. It'd be cool to see this graph updated to today's date.

Absolutely. I think this is huge. So much of the focus is on "what can you buy with bitcoin" and not on "what do people have that they can sell for bitcoin easily (other than cash)". Bitpay's payroll API is one (i.e. sell labor for bitcoins) and now you have another important piece (used electronics). Good job.

Going back to the issue at hand, I said these are natural consequences of their monetary policy. btw, don't compare USD monetary policy to ARS, it's night and day. As deserving as the FED is of criticism, it's an absolute saint next to the BCRA. 
Analogy: if my friend starts robbing liquor stores every day and I tell him "you're gonna get caught and go to jail", I don't have to predict exactly which time it's gonna happen for that statement to be prudent. So he pulls off 10 in a row without getting caught, then goes to jail on the 11th. I definitely can say "told you so; those were bad decisions." Your argument is my warning to him wasn't valid because I couldn't say which time it'd happen. That's ridiculous. 
As for BTC being a world currency, I don't actually think that will happen-- will you allow me to have that opinion since it agrees with yours?
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:42:38
I agree (it's the main--maybe only-- lesson that we can learn from altcoins: people love nominally large numbers). 
However, be careful: you tipped me 100 bits, which is 0.00010000 BTC. 0.00000100BTC, as you just wrote above, is just 1 bit. 
EDIT: I just realized you were saying better to tip bits than multiples of 0.000001, not referring to the tip you gave me. My bad.

I love this latest line of attack from you, which I've seen you repeat numerous times. Basically, since the spike in sales from the first day of accepting bitcoin didn't last, it's supposed to signify failure. Please.
Also, this "network transactions dropped 41% since november" line is equally dumb. During price runnups the transaction volume has always spiked up. But if you look at the overall trend, nothing has changed: 
That chart shows USD transaction volume on a log scale for alltime in bitcoin. That steady linear increase on the chart means exponential growth. The dropoff in volume from november is less than the dropoff in volume after the april bubble and much less than the 2011 bubble. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:35:09
You wrote the payments via western union in payments/month and the bitcoin sales in payments/day. Word to the wise, changing scales like that from one sentence to another causes unneeded confusion. At first glance it looks like you lost 30 WU sales and gained only 1 bitcoin sale. 
FTFY: *While I had around 30 payments per month via Western Union they have dropped significantly in December 2013. In fact, they dropped to ZERO!!! Meanwhile, Bitcoin payments have gone from 30 payment per month to 60 payments per month!

I don't know what the solution I'm looking for is, but it could include more granular payouts, p2pool style. My main concern is to break the ability to mine for someone else and give that other person the power of decision. 
As for calming down, the freakout is justified. It's not like the only bad thing that can happen with a 51%+ pool is double spending at coinbase. Among many concerns, one of the most troubling is the fact that you've given governments a quick shortcut to taking control of Bitcoin. We've seen how the US Government has made tech companies comply with their questionable/illegal surveillance and simultaneously served those tech companies with gag-orders to prevent them from saying they are compromised. If Google, Apple, etc, couldn't stand up to the US gov't, what makes you think GHash can? The fact is as of now, you can't really trust any transactions you make, especially if it's, say, silkroad-related stuff.

Exactly! So many people ignore this fact.

It's extremely common, unfortunately. If you ever meet exchange students who have been here a few months, ask them if they've had this done to them and almost all of them say yes. I met one kid that had three fake hundred peso notes in his wallet after falling for it three times. 
The most common method (especially before, with less inflation) was you'd hand them a 100, they'd switch it, and then hand it back to you and say they don't have change and ask if you had a smaller bill. Also they flip a switch and make the meter run faster on tourists. Assholes.

Yes, there are rules for currency, and they're not necessarily better than what are applied now to BTC (despite what everyone here thinks). For foreign currency there's like a several-hundred-dollar exemption, but otherwise the tax regime isn't better IIRC

Close, but no cigar. US laws say nothing about Bitcoin. The IRS interpreted the laws it *does* have as best it could and said btc is property. US laws do, however, have plenty to say about how the legal tender of other nations are treated taxwise. Is it unreasonable to think the IRS would be inclined, obliged, tempted, persuaded, or beaurocratically tilted towards treating it just like any of the other of hundreds of other currencies it deals with?

Absolutely, a percentage of TXs imply use, and as TXs increase, it does imply usage increases. However, I'd argue a much greater fraction of TXs for all the "altcoins" represent movements that are not comercial transactions. While you can argue a specific coin, like doge or lite, aren't scams, the vast majority are, and are mostly just pump and dumps. Mostly people that feel they missed the boat on Bitcoin and are hoping for their respective coin to take over. I suspect that will never happen. Because while I agree on the freedom to create and try different coins, and the idea of a backup altcoin, the truth is if bitcoin fails (commercially, technically, legally, whatever), it will likely mean the failure of all alts.

Hello kind DB. It was a double complaint really. First and foremost, it had two different units in conflict with each other. It was like saying, "your balance is $26 cents." Secondly, the number of decimal places didn't correspond with either of them. So in reality it looked like, "your balance is $17.3 cents." or in the case of all zeros: "your balance is $0.0 cents". 
Sure, I can figure it out, but it's unnecessarily confusing.

Yes, (if he is a US citizen) he would owe back taxes on the coins he mined, but since most of the coins he mined when they were worth nothing (literally) or maybe a few cents towards the end, his whole tax bill would probably come out to under a couple bucks. However, when he goes to sell them or uses them to buy something, he'll owe taxes on almost the entire amount because his cost basis will be essentially zero.

That's only one small part of the story. Many many people in the US do not have bank accounts by choice. For example, many immigrants.

I've never seen someone say this... With all due respect perhaps you are thinking of the suggestion I've seen mentioned several times here of taking a hash of a photo, and using that hash as a Brainwallet seed and then keeping the photo as your "key". This is also unsafe for the same reason you mentioned-- the digital photo has (likely) existed on a internet-connected device, and thus is unsafe. 
The latest variation of this suggestion that I've seen is to do a P2SH address using (1) a private key that is brainwallet seeded with a passphrase and (2) a pk that is a bw seeded with a hash of a photo. Not sure how secure this is, but I'm not inclined to trust this scheme either until I hear from people smarter than me if it's a good idea or not.

This is not true. There is a thriving market (in relative terms, of course) and you can always find buyers and sellers. There is no consistent "premium". You might think so by simply looking at the price of bitcoin in pesos and dividing by the "official" USD/ARS exchange rate, but this is incorrect. That exchange rate (~$8/USD) is a lie, no one can operate in that "market" the real value of a USD is what you can buy and sell it for on the street, and that's approx ARS$12.50 right now. At that exchange rate, bitcoin values in Argentina are in line with bitstamp/coinbase/etc.

I was one of those doing the asking. Thanks for incorporating it. 
Oooh... just thought of one more feature: instead of having to copy paste the TxID (which is hard to get to in some wallets), you could have the option to paste a public address. You could then detect new transactions being sent to that address. Why the public address instead of the txid? because this is information that is probably handy to the user at that moment-- they either still have it in their clipboard, or you could even include a option to scan a QR code, since they probably have that QR code nearby if they just used it to send some bits.

What I think is that it's best for it to grow and achieve stability through organic growth and being tested over and over and over again, than a sort of fake stability through central planning. Make no mistake, when the market has more depth and bitcoin is more valuable it *will* stabilize. Meanwhile, the market is learning to deal with that instability. 
Here's a parallel you might find illuminating: I live in argentina and the economy here is boom and bust in a way that the US hasn't seen since the great depression.. but here it's every 10 years. Add to that that laws and policies and everything changes month to month-- you never know what's gonna happen. So what ends up happening in the long run? Business learn to adapt. Business owners and managers don't sweat 10-15% month to month upward or downward swings (common) and can handle +/-50% swings. Why? Because of practice. Meanwhile, in the super-stable USA, home prices dip a bit and everything starts collapsing. (Read "Anti-fragile"-- a great exploration of this common sense concept).
This is like bitcoin. Trial by fire with crazy 20-50% intraday swings, then later we'll be battle tested and ready for relative stability.

Watch out with all the pie in the sky rhetoric about bitcoin and argentina. Argentines will use (and are using) bitcoin to move money in and out of the country, but Argentina will not be a hotbed of innovation and adoption in Bitcoin. Government regulations of commerce and banking are too onerous. 
EDIT: btw, real estate is down not because there's no credit in dollars (there never really has been mortgages here like you're used to in the US; just 4 or 5 year loans with 15%+ interest on up to 20 or 30% of the value of the property... none of that 30-40 years, 3% craziness). No, real estate is down because the government prohibited transacting RE in dollars and basically shut down the market for USD. Almost all RE transactions are done by sitting down at a table, signing all the paperwork and handing over a bundle of cash-- no escrow services, bank transfers, etc.-- and now that bundle of dollars needs to be several trashbags full of pesos (since the biggest bill, AR$100 is worth just over 6USD). Since no one wants to take their safe RE asset and turn it into colorful confetti, transactions are way down.

Yes, I am aware, as I'm also aware that they have a tremendous amount of hashing power physically in their control (whether or not they "sell" the Gigahashes is irrelevant). I'm also aware that they could easily be playing a game where they point a certain percentage of those to unknown IP addresses to hide their ownership, and keep their "official" hashing power under the magic 50%

First of all, the first paragraph was a thought that came to me the last time I got involved in a deflation/bitcoin argument that was informed by my own experience. I made a speculative bet on bitcoin and it paid off. I'd love to hold on to it all, but suddenly I have some money, so I paid of school loans, I live a little more lavishly, and took a trip to Miami for the bitcoin conference. All things I wouldn't have done before. Anyway, that's not a rigorous proof, but I remember getting that "aha" moment when I was like, "wait, everyone is ignoring the income/wealth effect". 
I don't know why bring up a meteorite example. Plenty of people have come across great natural wealth and then sold it and spent the money-- people who discover oil on their property, people with land when a new crop comes on the scene that makes the land more valuable (think soy in Argentina), etc. Even in pop culture (i.e. beverly hill billies) everyone knows that as you get increasing wealth humans tend to start to consume it. Why would bitcoin be any different? Plus the chipping the meteorite comment serves to emphasize one of bitcoin's advantages: it's almost infinite divisibility, with no drawbacks (for example, gold is hard to divide in very small bits because it's hard to keep track of, measure, etc.)
I do agree that bitcoin might stop some kinds of purchases. For example, when I was a kid and living through hyperinflation in Argentina, my mom would go to the supermarket and buy absolutely everything she could (that's life in hyperinflation). Would she have bought that 14th package of spaghetti and 120th roll of toilette paper with a deflationary currency? Probably not. Is that a bad thing? Probably not.

No. You're dividing the peso value by the official exchange rate. This is wrong. That official exchange rate is essentially a lie (you can't access that market freely). Divide the peso value of bitcoin  by the blue dollar rate and you'll get approx the same international price (bitcoins tend to trade for slightly less than their international rate here... Seems like there are always more sellers than buyers.)

True, but still, in 2011 it reached an ath of $33 and proceeded to go on an epic fall to $2... it took 2 years to break that previous ath. Just saying, the tendency is up, but there are no guarantees that Bitcoin will grow 1000% year over year consistently.

I'm convinced now that there is only one news item that will move the price up now and begin the next speculative investment phase (yes, it's all speculation until you have a few hundred million daily users), and that is the approval and launch of the bitcoin ETF (winlevoss twins' project). That brings the next class of investor in (institutional, and individual non-young-nerdy-males). Every day that that doesn't happen, there is a little less confidence in its eventual approval and the price reflects that. 
Until then, 10% monetary emission (inflation) will continue taking its toll.

Well, information exists outside of pictures... for example I could know because I took it, or there was a caption, or I knew who took it.
Back to the picture, I know about their use of Firechat from news reports. I just felt like this image was emblematic, with everyone holding their phones in the air, the very tool they are using to communicate to rise up together.

Absolutely he could. I suspect he's doing this to become solvent:
1. Take 10 kBTC from cold storage, send to bitstamp. 
2. Sell for $6M.
3. Withdrawn USD to gox's accounts. 
4. Set up new fake mtgox account with $1.5M (fake as in fake person, real account).
5. 'Buy' 10 kBTC (essentially take mtgoxBTC from a RealCustomer[s] account to the new fake one) for $150 each, or $1.5M
6. Process a btc withdrawal from fake account, and then place the 10 kbtc back into cold storage, replacing what was taken as if nothing happened.
7. Delete fake customer account as if the person requested their account be deleted (plausible deniability).
8. RealCustomer now turned his mtgoxBTC into USD at firesale price (for which there is corresponding USD in bank account), and mtgox now has $4.5M more.
9. Rinse, repeat. 
Do this until all funds replaced and business solvent again. (btw, if they have all customer USD, but need BTC, the process above can be trivially tweaked to result in ending up with more BTC instead of more USD).
This is PURE SPECULATION. But it fits. Remember that this is all unregulated, so while their overall fraud is illegal, each of these steps by themselves may be perfectly legal. IANAL, and I know nothing about how the Japanese legal system works.

I think people are missing what's actually going on: over the last year we saw massive increases in difficulty due to the adoption of ASICs. ASICs are several orders of magnitude better than the previous technology (GPU, FPGA), so the rate of change in hashing power was astronomical. However, with ASICS fully adopted now, and no new transformational technology in sight, increases in hashing power will most likely start to resemble Moore's law (or something close), not Moore's Law^10 like the past 14 months. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:58:52
Oooooh, I strongly disagree. This equation concerns actual use of the currency in question, not the methods by which it's measured. Blockchain transactions are an imperfect measurement: they include movements that are not economic (the equivalent of taking cash from one pocket and putting it in another), and some that are (like buying a good). They also exclude, by definition, off-chain transactions. But again, this is the measurement, not the actual use. Just like there's no way to precisely and conclusively measure how many times a ten dollar bill changes hands (cash in this sense is like off chain txs). When you say "spoof supply", you may be thinking about fractional reserve banking, which is a whole other issue entirely.

It's not "picking the one graph", and certainly not handwaving. When you talk about percentage changes, and you want to see the long term trend visually, you have to look at a logarithmic graph. There you can see all %age movements in proportion to each other (i.e. a drop from 10 to 5, is the same as a drop from 1000 to 500, not 100x smaller as a linear graph would imply). Thus you can see that the dropoff from the november peak till now (from 400M USD to 100M USD, a 4x drop, actually worse than what you quoted above), is less bad than the previous april bubble when it dropped 6x (106M USD to 16M USD), and much less than 2011's drop (about 60x). Yet even with this drop transaction volume is still 4-5x higher than before the November runup and 2300x higher than before the 2011 runup. 
And yes, 1st to 2nd day huge dropoffs ARE expected. When Call of Duty 37 or whatever comes out, they sell 1 Billion dollars worth on the first day, and then a fraction of that on the second day. Big blockbuster movies come out and sell 500M the first weekend and a fraction of that the second weekend. Same here: Big announcement, bitcoin community gets excited, tries it out, shows support, posts huge numbers the first day, and then you go back down to whatever normal rate of sales at which 2 million or so bitcoiners would be buying shit from overstock or tigerdirect.

Again with this throwaway trolling.... so sick of it. Consider:
**Not getting it:**
* "The CEO of Bitcoin today spoke about...."
* "...but since the supply is limited to 21 million, it's not clear what will happen once more than 21 million people want to use it..."
* "nothing's stopping the developers from just changing the code and making more bitcoins for themselves!"
* "But deflation, therefore bad"
**Getting it, but skeptical:**
* "I get bitcoin is decentralized, but the fact is the dev team is a limited number of people. The fact that others could join or take over, or that their updates could be ignored, doesn't change the fact that they are making decisions for the rest of the Bitcoin community! What's the difference with a central bank or government?"
* "Bitcoin might be better for payments online for most goods, but I'm still really skeptical of it being of any use for face to face transactions. I think that's gonna limit any sort of widespread adoption."
* Governments might not be able to stop the protocol, but they can always jail you for posting signs saying you accept Bitcoin, or impose less draconian punishments. In any case, they will eventually see the threat and they will shut it down for the masses. Then it will continue to exist and continue to be useful, but only of a tiny subsection of geeks, with a corresponding tiny market cap. 
**Getting it, aware of actual issues**
* "The current 7 tx/sec limit is meant to control spam, and I understand it can be changed without the need for a hardfork, but will they just have to continually keep upping the cap, or is there an end game? Will there eventually be a pruning mechanism put in place? Would that require a hard fork? How do we know Bitcoin will survive the transition?"
* "So Bitcoin is completely decentralized, but what's with the Alert system? Sure it's not used and it can only be used to send alert messages, but don't you think that goes against the decentralized ethos of the project?"
* Deflation is bad usually because prices and wages are sticky, meaning the economy can't adjust in the event of a downturn by lowering real wages (as inflation does). Now, Bitcoin doesn't have that problem because no wages or prices are really fixed in Bitcoin (except the Bitcoin Trezor preorder), but doesn't this limit it to never being used as the official currency of a country? Or is that not something bitcoiners aspire to? Is everyone fine with its ultimate endgame just being a new gold-like asset?
**Getting it, joking, hanging out with friends, or feeling bullish**
* "To the Moon!!!!"
EDIT: Changed *"nothing's stopping some hacker from just hacking it and making himself more bitcoins!"* to *"nothing's stopping the developers from just changing the code and making more bitcoins for themselves!"* to be more representative of common criticism from ignorance.

BTW, the money situation is the easiest part. The hard part will be buying and selling the car legally. This isn't the US where you just sign a piece of paper and you're done. I think this alone will put your plan on ice. I say aim for renting or just bus it like the rest of the tourists.

"better ATMs" -- ATM design is not the problem. Or do you think it's easier to make an ATM with fingerprint scanners, cameras, etc., than without?
No, ATMs are complicated because the laws of the governments of the dirt those ATMs sit on are onerous. Nobody wants to spend several thousand dollars on an ATM and then have it seized by the government on bogus "terrorism"/"money laundering" charges, and then even face jail time. 
Saying the problem is that ATMs aren't "good enough" is ignorant, at best.

My point was not so much to use this to calculate exact values, but rather to make logical inferences. For example (just off the top of my head-- I've checked none of this): 
"Assume % of transactions that are commercial in nature (not just movements) is fixed. Thus we calculate velocity and show it has remained constant for the last 18 months. Thus, assuming velocity stays constant, and a steady increase in the monetary supply at a rate of 2.5btc/min, if T increases at a greater rate than nominal bitcoin emission (approx 8%), the general price level would be expected to fall (i.e. bitcoins appreciate)."
I just completely made that up and I can think of a million things that are wrong with that statement. My point is that the equation allows you to base your arguments on a strong starting point, even if you don't have specific figures.

Well, some might point to the fact that he later denied it and said he only learned about Bitcoin 3 weeks ago when his son told him a reporter had called about it.
But after watching his denial, I'm not convinced by it. He seemed like he was lying, and also his English is much better than he claims it is and what is on display by those Amazon reviews people dug up. 
I think there's a pretty good chance it's him. If it's not, I'm going back to my previous favorite theory: that's it's Nick Szabo (spends years developing a Bitcoin-like protocol called bit-gold, then stops talking about it when Bitcoin comes out, and the satoshi paper makes no reference to his work... hmmm).

Gezzus man. Are you being fucking obtuse on purpose, or did you not read what I wrote? Actually I suspect you're just being disingenuous. 
Total sent in USD per day is much larger in Bitcoin ( I'd argue a greater percentage of bitcoin TXs are economic in nature (trading for something, including consumer purchases, as opposed to moving between wallets) as compared to Doge. Thus, combining more TX with higher percentage of TXs being actual "use", I argue that bitcoin is much much much more used. Therefore, we arrive at my original sarcastic comment when someone said "people use them": "evidence?", meaning, it's so low as to be worthy of a joke. 
As for circlejerks, go back to for a prime example.

This image was originally made as criticism of the Argentine Peso. The original image showed a $100 peso bill in those three years and what it could buy. You can tell because the products are in spanish and you can clearly see a bag of yerba mate. 
While the USD is inflationary, this is a gross misrepresentation of the decrease in purchasing power of the USD (why exaggerate if the truth is bad enough?) 
Meanwhile the argentine peso has gone from AR$1=US$1 to AR$1=US$0.06 between 1998 and now.

As dev said, there's many cases when you need to know how many confirmations you have an it's a pain to keep checking. For example, say you want to urgently sell some btc on bitstamp, so you send the TX and then have to wait a certain amount of confirmations. This allows you to set and alarm and forget about it, instead of refreshing the page. I've also already used it when explaining bitcoin to a newbie ("I sent you some bitcoin. In about 5 min it'll be in the  blockchain" ding ding "there it is!")

As all alts are thinly traded with respect to USD and other fiats, and almost all (99.9999%) of uses for alts also accept btc, I'd say it's mostly people trying to pump up alts. Not a value judgement on doge per se, but I think that mostly describes the entire alt ecosystem.

Hahaha. Nah, I posted in response to a comment in another post. At first I addressed the commenter's particular claim, but then I just decided to leave it more generic-- just give people a tool to look at these issues. 
My point is when you say "people are hoarding that's why the price is going down", or "the price of bitcoin will only go up as people adopt it and spend more", or "the price is going down because all these merchants immediately convert their bitcoin to fiat", etc., this equation is a good starting point to make your argument.

First, what's with the anger? Second, I'm just saying it'll get there. It's unreasonable to expect it to be stable when it's still thinly traded and has no central planning. Third, not to compare bitcoin to these, but a fuck ton of currencies out there are not good stores of value. They're still currencies. So your argument is fallacious. 
Unit of account - store of value - medium of exchange &lt;--- three characteristics that different money systems share but in varying degrees: 
Gold-- great store of value, not unit of account and pretty terrible for exchange now a days; 
USD--worldwide unit of account, excellent medium of exchange (esp in person), moderately good store of value (lost 95% of value in last 8-9 decades, but slowly and consistently). 
Special Drawing Rights-- basically exists to be a unit of account, good medium of exchange but only between governments, moderate store of value.
Get it? And relaxitaxi, please.

I see you think you're calling people out on that as if it was something shameful, but it is true, minimum wage laws hurt more than they help and they hurt the most needy most of all. Although the intentions behind (some) supporters of minimum wage laws are good, that doesn't excuse them from the harm they cause. The standard response now would be "oh but a bunch of studies show a modest rise in MW doesn't cause unemployment" or "this one study showed that in a town where walmart had monopsony power in the labor market and increase in the MW actually raised employment!". Both irrelevant. The second example is super specific, and no MW laws target that specific scenario. The first is just taking cover in the imprecision of statistics: "I don't know which specific 500,000 (mostly black inner city youth) will be unable to get a job, and they'll probably fall within the margin of error, thus I'm free from the moral implications of my political advocacy for a higher MW". MW is presented as a moral imperative yet they never push for more than a few %age increase. Why is that? Why not set minimum yearly salary at 60k a year and that way no one will be below average? Because they know the truth of the consequences, and at that level they'd be too large to conceal or deny. Thus small changes, with clear benefits to some and hidden harm to others. Great for getting re-elected, not great for society and those in most need. Cynical, but true. This is the MW debate.

Look, the decimal place in bitcoin was chosen somewhat arbitrarily to begin with. It served its purpose well for 5 years, and it's time to move on. Also, BTC was chosen rather quickly, but the fact is it's unusable in the international system because BIX is reserved. So it must start with X, like gold XAU. Some people started using XBT to mean one current bitcoin, but not that many. So some advocate redefining the base (not smallest, like cents, but base, like dollars) unit to be "bits" and the symbol to be XBT (or if that also can't fit in the international system, XBC or whatever) and for it to be worth 100 satoshis, thus leaving the currency with divisible by 100, like most currencies in the world.

There's a couple issues to take into account. 
1. The way satoshidice was designed, it had two transactions for every one play. It's like if VISA processed two payments everytime you placed a bet at roulette in the casino-- that's spam. The gambling industry in bitcoin is moving strongly to off-chain gambling, like just-dice.com: You deposit, play thousands or hundreds of thousands of times, and then withdraw (just like any casino). 1 to 1 million+ bets, only two TX. Just-Dice has had 580M bets in 6 months (running at about 200 bets per second right now). Satoshidice right now shows 541 bets done today (looks like 3 per minute). This is not decreasing gambling, it's much much higher. Satoshidice was a cool concept ("provably fair", returning winnings without waiting for confirmations, etc.), but ultimately it's not so good because it's slow. Now there is much more gambling going on.
2. What should we call off-chain transactions? Well, that's kinda like M2, no? The thing is there isn't any (or hardly any) fractional reserve going on in Bitcoin yet, so it's not entirely accurate. Bitcoins are like M0/Narrow money/Cash, and services with hot wallets like Coinbase, Just-Dice, etc. would be like M0.5, or M1 (demand deposits) with the no-FRB difference. So my question to you is, when talking about fiat, do we ignore transactions between savings and money market accounts? Credit cards paid from checking accounts? Direct deposits from business checking accounts to personal savings accounts? No. We take them all into account (and have the names M0, M1, M2, M3, etc. to distinguish them). So why ignore them when speaking of bitcoin? Does Just-dice only do 20-30 operations a day because that's what's on the blockchain? Or does it do several million, but just within accounts on its system?


I phrased that wrong. I should have said something like "you dismiss the very thing that people use as a yard stick of bitcoin adoption". Basically what I meant was a year ago bitcoin was dismissed as "oh it's only for gambling, drugs and child porn, you can't use it for anything real". So now that drugs are gone and satoshidice doesn't dominate the blockchain, it would seem like that would be a "hey, look, bitcoin is moving on from all that bad shit we criticized." 


I read everything-- including every negative article out there. I'm a super skeptical person. It's just that with Bitcoin, I'm convinced. :)


See above about FRB/M0/M1/M2. Absolutely I agree that there are not easy parallels. Especially since there is no FRB *yet* in Bitcoin (bitcoiners that say it can't happen, or won't, are wrong). It's still super fucking interesting that despite the vast differences, he still found that velocity coincided. That's cool no matter how you slice it. You know that if he'd found velocity in bitcoin to be 1 and in USD to be 6 you'd be saying, "Look! It moves around 6 times slower than realmoney!".


You continually ignore that a major part of that infrastructure is taking stuff off-chain. But that's fine. You're smart enough to understand it, you just don't want to take it into account. 
As for speculation, absofuckinglutely! Of course the bitcoin price is based on speculation! But it's based on speculation about what is possible in the future based on what we have right now. It's speculation just like it was speculation in 1995 to buy cocacola.com or porn.com or buy.com or aa/ab/ac/ad/.../zy/zz.com. There was reason for it because people saw what was possible in the future. But in 1995, buying all that shit would cost you thousands of dollars and they were worth precisely zero in terms of cashflow or utility (or any metric) at the time. Now those speculative bets on essentially ether paid off 10x to 10,000,000x. 




Of course we're both fine with disagreeing with each other. The whole point of debate is to try to present your point of view and try to convince the other party. The fact that we debate implies we respect each other to some extent, or else we'd simply ignore each other.

zero is not impossible. I'm a true-believer, but don't forget this is an experiment. Any number of things can happen. If it were a 100% given it would succeed, the price would be the [saturn] by now. The way I see it, a top-end bitcoin valuation is about 100k, so at $500, the market sees a 0.5% chance of success. I see a, say, 50% chance of success, thus I find btc undervalued and I buy.

He's referring to the fact that in one paragraph the OP is talking about reducing payment costs of 3% in order to double a restaurant's net profit, but then the restaurant offers a ten percent discount for payment in bitcoin, or 3x the cost of taking a credit card. 
Both the OP/Restaurant and witcoins have a point. 
Witcoins would have a point if the world was static and some bitcoin sales simply replaced what would have been credit card sales. But the restaurant is correctly betting (in my opinion) that this 10% offer will drive bitcoiners to the restaurant and foster goodwill in the community, thus increasing gross sales. Remember that while a restaurant's NET profit might be 2-5%, the GROSS profit on an individual dish/drink can be huge (50-90%, depending on what), thus discounting 10% might cut down the gross profit on an individual sale a bit, but you'll only need a modest bump in traffic to make up for it. A few bitcoin meetups per year and a great turn out during the conference week/end, and I'm sure they'll be money ahead. AAAAANNND let's not forget the whole bitcoin-going-up-thousands-of-percent-per-year.

Hey Jason. We met briefly in Miami in January and for what it's worth, I trust you :) 
But if I may make a suggestion, maybe beyond stating that you don't derive compensation from SO, you could share what you *do* derive income from. Why? Because sometimes less scrupulous people might say "I derive no benefit from this charity" but then it is revealed they take 20% whateverthefuck fee upfront and hide behind arguments that "that money wasn't yet in the charity", or something the charity buys regularly is from a relative, or other tricky nonsense. 
So sharing what your source of income is can make people feel more comfortable with your other monetary claims. I don't think this can be demanded from you, we all agree on personal financial privacy after all, but you might consider it voluntarily. 
Please take this in the spirit with which it's intended! Peace!

Here's where the role of altcoins come in to the crypto ecosystem. Dogecoin will have to implement one of the many ideas for pruning the blockchain. This will serve as a good testing ground for Bitcoin. Bitcoin obviously has the same problem, but the developers put a minimum tx size and a minimum fee to try to reduce the bloat from micro-transactions. Doge has embraced this and we see it in a blockchain that grows at least 5x faster than Bitcoin's. The ultimate answer to this is to find a rate of growth of the blockchain that matches the rate of growth of storage/memory production capacity (for a given price level), which I think is something like double every 12 months (faster than Moore's Law). 
BTW check this out:  You can see the remnants of all the dust in thousands of addresses from micro-transactions in the past in Bitcoin. My point is Doge didn't invent this, it's just embracing something that was abandoned because it is problematic. It's not unsolvable, but Doge hasn't solved it.

 Check the link: "Updated: Jul 11, 2012" They tweeted a sneak peak of blockchain.com (instead of .info) with a picture of an iphone. If that means they're gonna release a new app, that's awesome, but this current app hasn't been updated. I heard first hand from someone inside Blockchain about how they were able to sneak into the app store and why they can't touch it if they want it to remain there.

because if you define the base unit as bits, then you have two decimal places after, just like almost all currencies. Thus, this will allow bitcoin to more easily integrate with legacy banking systems.

You're taking something I stated clearly and making it sound like I'm trying to hide something. Yes, I was giving the context to show that a "41% plummet" (actually you could argue it's fallen 75% from its november peak) is nothing in the context of its exponential growth and normal volatility (the fall off from previous peaks were even greater). Take that 60 day chart and turn it into 180 days. How's that plummet look now? 12M USD to 138M USD (11.5x).

An exchange traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the value of a certain underlying asset, but that you can trade like a stock-- that way you can buy and sell small quantities easily. There are ETFs for all kinds of assets: you can buy ETF shares that track the S&amp;P500, ones that track Gold (or Silver, or Titanium, or whatever), etc. You can even design ETFs to track things like 2x the SP500 (so if the index goes up 10%, your investment goes up 20%), or 3x, or -1x/-2x/-3x, etc. 
The Winklevii twins are working on making an ETF that tracks the Bitcoin price. That means anyone with an etrade account will be able to "invest" in bitcoin, meaning they will expose themselves to the price movements, but not really hold it themselves-- they will in essence be paying the winklevii to buy/hold/protect/sell the bitcoin for them.

BTW how's that dogechain/blockchain coming along? From asking in (impossible to find this info elsewhere, apparently) the blockchain is already 2GB, so it's growing at about 1GB per month (likely accelerating). Hmmmm... so the same problem with micro-transactions that bitcoin had, but with no changes, just no minimum tx size and no block size limit. Such innovation, many tx, little GB, wow.  :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:03:52
There's several reasons. Like with some precious metals, for some retail investors it's hard to own the underlying asset, even if it can be divided into small parts . Same here: some people might want to be exposed to the investment gains and losses but prefer to let someone else take care of storing it. They might want to invest millions so the fractions of bitcoin are irrelevant, the important part to them is investing and forgetting about it, not worrying about storage. 
Plus, by having an etf, it allows all sorts of investors (especially institutional investors) who otherwise would not be able to invest in bitcoin because they are not allowed to by their charter (many funds don't allow their managers to just buy assets, like houses or hotels or gold, but they can buy regulated instruments based on these underlying assets). This is probably where the biggest boon to bitcoin would come from (in terms of high $$ investments). 
Does that help?

No, actually some people/entities can't buy bitcoin (for example, most investment funds). And as for individuals, you think the propensity to buy for an 86 year old is the same if he can do it through his regular broker as if he has to go on localbitcoins or connect his bank account to circle.com?

One solution I never see brought up (and probably for good reason) is to change the protocol to remove the ability to do pooled mining. Wouldn't this drastically reduce the probability of someone having more than 51% of the network under their effective control? It would make everyone have to eat the variance, but the expected reward for each miner wouldn't go down. 
Can someone ELI5 why this wouldn't work/isn't possible/is a terrible idea? And not just from the perspective of a miner that wants a smoother reward schedule.

This is a common feature of BTC markets as there is no limitation on insider trading, thus I find that drastic market movements (up or down) tend to precede drastic news (good or bad).

Exactly, it's too simple: "The value goes up therefore it goes down". No mention of, for example, the Income Effect: as the value rises, so does the hoarder's wealth. Is the argument really that they want nothing in this world other than to maintain their numerical number of bitcoin? 
Plus this is just pop-economics/pop-keynesianism. Hoarding is not why Keynsianism abhors deflation. It's because wages, prices and debt usually are sticky-- especially wages: people expect the nominal value of their wages not to fall (sticky down), thus they gladly accept falling real income, but go nuts over falling nominal income. THIS is the real argument against deflation from a Keyenesian standpoint and it is IRRELEVANT in bitcoin, since (damn near) no one is paid a nominally-fixed bitcoin wage (the few people who receive their wages in bitcoin have it indexed to dollars), (damn near) no one sets prices nominally in bitcoin (Trezor launch being the only counter example that comes to mind-- everyone else sets prices in dollars and adjust given the current exchange rate), and there is almost no one indebted in bitcoin and certainly not a whole industry by government mandate (banking). Thus the argument, with the tiniest bit of thought (and not newfangled bitcoiny thought, but just the same ole econ of the last few decades), isn't as simple as "deflation bad thus crash". 
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:44:31
I swear I wasn't trying to be pretentious. I've previously not objected to the use of "fiat" to describe bitcoin, because I focused on the fact that it wasn't commodity-backed. The thought just came to me today, though, that fiat necessarily implies an authority. So I wanted a way to contrast bitcoin, so I came up with id est. While fiat money is the government saying, "let this be money", id est money is "no need for an authority, it just is." Again, this is meant to provide clarity in the nomenclature, not create an unnecessary air of pretentiousness.

He has plenty of bitcoin. His friend is a skeptic, so he made a ridiculous bet to show how confident he is. 
And yes, lose-lose bets give you bragging rights. Ever play poker? Or watch it on tv? Ever seen when they play the 7-2 game? In the middle of a hold'em game many times players will play a prop bet that says they get an extra $x if they win a hand holding 7-2. On tv at a 200-400 table they might make it a $100 prop bet, where each player at the table pays the person who wins with 7-2 $100. Sometimes they get into situations where they are betting several tens of thousands of dollars just to win the extra $900. It makes no sense, but it gives you bragging rights. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:42:34
I agree with your analysis completely, except at the end: I don't think "pump and dump" is a lazy copout, but a logical inference from the lack of use you describe before. 
In other words, since you need to go through Bitcoin to get to doge or lite from fiat, and they are thinly traded at best, and people do not hold significant wealth there, and their blockchains are orders of magnitude more vulnerable than bitcoin, and every use for them is covered by BTC, then is is a pretty reasonable conclusion that disingenuous arguments in their favor can be attributed to trying to pump them (though I'll conceed maybe not dump them).

Who says they're not? I don't think we've seen mainstream use anywhere really in the world yet, it's still firmly in early-adopter phase. But within that category, I think Argentina is doing quite well. People in Argentina are well versed in the foils of fiat currencies and thus are very receptive to the idea of Bitcoin. So the early-adopter bitcoin community is thriving (almost 1000 in the meetup.com page, almost 3000 members in the Bitcoin-Argentina facebook page). There still a looooooooong way to go!

Most nodes in the network are not miners (and this trend will likely become stronger in the future), therefore they will be unaffected by the profit motive of the mining fee, as they see no part of it. So just as you can envision miners purposefully dropping a lower fee original tx for its higher-fee double-spend, you might also envision other nodes purposefully not forwarding these because it's in their interest to not encourage and help double-spends to make the network more useful, just as they do today. 
What it will come down to is businesses that accept zero confirmation transactions will have to listen to the network to see how many nodes (incl. miners) are broadcasting the tx. Mycelium has a neat feature coming soon that shows a bar that goes from 0 to 100% representing how many nodes have your tx. That, coupled with detecting double spends, should be enough to accept btc for that $5 coffee. 
Also, double spends like this would be worthwhile in very narrow circumstances. In-person transactions at a store are out, because you'd show your face and be seen by cameras (btc or no btc, it's clearly fraud and illegal). In that case you'd be better off passing off a fake $20, at least you get plausible deniability there. In online transactions, it'd have to be products that are instantly delivered and irrevocable. So subscriptions are out, most services are out, etc. I supposed it'd be worth trying if you were buying some sort of unlock code or a gift card code, but then that merchant can simply require a confirmation or two, with the only inconvenience being the delay to receive your code (which sometimes happens today even with credit cards.)
Finally, keep in mind that every payment method has risks and known vulnerabilities. You simply plan and adapt accordingly: 
1. You take cash even though you know you can get fake bills or get robbed at gunpoint. 
2. You take credit cards ever though it takes 1 month for "1 confirmation" (deposited in your account and able to be spent) and 4 months for "6 confimations" ("irreversible").
3. You take checks even though.... 
4. Etc.
Hope this helps.

It's not a lie. It's imprecise. He can send $5 worth of value for the tx fee. This is not an uncommon thing to say. When I buy something here in argentina, for example a car, I can say it cost $15,000 dollars, when in fact I earned the money in pesos, paid in pesos, and the dealership kept the money in pesos, and dollars were never part of the exchange. I simply state the value in dollars because dollars have a more stable (though steadily decreasing) value. If I had changed from dollars to pesos, and the dealership from pesos to dollars, then yes, there would have been exchange costs incurred.

I think people are overestimating this theory of self-interest. It *is* valuable to have a very good world-wide centralized payment network like bitcoin. Many companies like this exist.

It's only unquestionably bad for everyone else who's mining or wants a decentralized payment network.

TXs ~ use
So if say 50% of BTC TXs are economic in nature, and 10% of doge TXs are economic in nature (ABSOLUTE SPECULATION, yes), then if TXs in BTC are 20x those in DOGE, then bitcoin "use" is 20*5=100x DOGE use. So we're talking two orders of magnitude difference. Hence, being dismissive of saying people "use" doge. Again, I repeat, I think doge use is mostly people trying to justify its existence and hoping it overtakes Bitcoin because they feel they missed the boat. In fact, your sentiment is pretty much reflects this:


Thus, as a default rule to protect myself and newbs that read about alts, my first default tendency is to dismiss them all (even if one eventually is useful, like a fully anonymous coin), because 99.99% of them are deceptive at best and scams at worst, and mostly just ways to get more BTC. So noobs, skip the scams, and go straight to cryptos' best hope, bitcoin.

It'd be nice if big popular wallets (say Blockchain) automatically coinjoined and gave you the option to opt-out. Just that significant fraction of transactions being coinjoined would kill taint analysis and provide much better anonymity for everyone.

Do consider it. It's very much in line with the concept of "antifragility": let's embrace shocks to the system and use them to become stronger, more resilient, more antifragile... and not just simply avoid them and thereby become weaker, more fragile (like the banking system).

You actually have it backwards. If you issue refunds for the dollars amount at the current USD/BTC price, then you would pay them back .5BTC when the price of BTC *DOUBLED*, not halved. Which incidentally would exactly what would have happened if they sold BTC instead of buying the fridge, and then repurchased the BTC instead of returning the fridge.

@_date: 2014-08-14 15:40:08
slight correction: most currencies have as an objective to be stable (well, stable with a downward trend). Most, end up failing at this objective. So you get 5-50 years of stability, and *whack!* at the end (or periodically). I lived through hyperinflation as a child in Argentina (Australes was the currency back then)-- 100% inflation per month at one point. That's at least a tinsy bit volatile, no?
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:34:04
No point in going through the this change twice. That's why I nonlinear support the mbtc in-between step. As for number of units, the reality is after hundreds and hundreds of useless altcoins, the one thing we've definitely learned is that humans are intensly nominal, and would much prefer getting 10,000 units for a buck, than getting 0.001 units, even if it's the same goddamn thing. It's the whole reason dogecoin exists AT ALL (community my ass, everyone just likes being a "billionaire"). So instead of fighting that psychology, let's embrace it, and have the double benefit of fitting in with existing conventions (like 2 decimal places) and not having to go through this frustrating transition again.

meh. Bitcoin is a store of value in that it can't be devalued by those with arbitrary political power. The value is exactly what the market determines it to be, with the people determining it's value having skin in the game. That's fine by me. Real stability won't come until btc is worth 100k+ usd or 0 usd.

Fair enough. I edited it now for what is a more common protestation from the msm when they are ignorant of how it works. 
The point being that they think anyone can just create more bitcoin because it's "imaginary" or "virtual". As you mention, it was rolled back, people didn't just accept the new currency like we accept the new Pesos being printed today.

First of all, that's kind of disconcerting for someone who claims/wants/hopes to speak for the bitcoin community. You should definitely try to educate yourself. 
As for the hash, go to  (made by on twitter) and follow the steps. It's really easy.
I suggest you zip all the files you have together, then go to this website, choose the file (the site will hash the document client-side, meaning it doesn't get uploaded), then follow the steps. You do have to make a nominal payment in btc, and I'm aware you sold all yours, so if you don't have any bitcents floating around I'll give them to you. 
When you finish the process, you'll have irrefutable proof that those documents existed on this date because the hash of them will be imbedded in the blockchain, which would be impossible to forge on a later date.

The minimum price you can set a stream at is the USD/hr equivalent of 1 satoshi per second at the current exchange rate. Comes out to about half a cent per hour.

LOL, I should have just said I bought each new iphone. Here's the deal: I live outside the US, so every time I'd go to visit the US, I'd buy a brand new one, and sell my old one outside the US and either break even or make a few bucks. Therefore the 15 iphone figure. But, you're right, I should have just said I bought all the models and made it easier to understand.

Streamium isn't off-chain, per se. The per-second price adjustments are, but they have to be or else miner fees would be 1000x the price of the video (the price is adjusted by 0.00000xxx btc/sec for your typical stream). For each stream, two transactions are added to the blockchain (the initial escrow, and the final payout).

I actually see it backwards: with bitcoin, mesh networks (and internet) can reach every point on the planet, banning (or unplugging) the internet would become even more ineffective (see what I did there?)
Why is this? Because Bitcoin allows machines to exchange value, thus you can have a system where nodes are compensated for the bandwidth the provide. This is working in HK because text messaging is low bandwidth and everybody contributes out of a sense of camaraderie and duty, but you need bitcoin to build solid, stable, long term meshnets.

That's one of the crazy things about the current government's economic policies. Since the official exchange rate is set artificially low (meaning, the peso is overvalued, even with the recent devaluation) exporting is less lucrative than it should be (whereas a dollar is worth about 12 pesos on the street, if you import, the government will only give you 8; 33% less). On top of that there are "retenciones" which is like withholding, except you likely will never get those pre-paid taxes back (they make the conditions basically impossible to meet), so this essentially serves to reduce your "effective" exchange rate down to anywhere from 5.2 pesos/USD to 7.2 pesos/USD. That means when you export, your customer pays X and you receive just X/2 or 2X/3.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:28:35
Yes. If you have trouble with the "fractional nature" of the slot concept (half a slot, half the price), then forget the decimal point and "bitcoin" designation (which is arbitrary), and think of it as a ledger with 2,100,000,000,000,000 (2.1 quadrillion) slots (aka, satoshis). Currently you can buy about 2,625,000,000,000 (2.6 billion) of them for a dollar on Bitstamp. 
Does that help?

Hi, Streamium dev here. I think your concern about Streamium and the number of transactions the blockchain can handle is due to either: 
1. You think Streamium is so popular that in 72hrs that it has eclipsed all other uses of bitcoin to become the most popular use of bitcoin in the world, or
2. Respectfully, you don't understand how micropayment channels work. 
Number 1 is very flattering, but alas I believe it is not the case. 
So that leaves us with  What you need to know is that when you use micropayment channels, you are NOT pushing transactions to the block chain every minute or second. For each stream only TWO (2) transactions are pushed to the blockchain: basically, one that holds the funds in escrow, and one that finally distributes the funds between the client and the provider. That's TWO (2) transactions per stream, no matter what the length/price/etc. of the stream. 
I hope this clears it up! Feel free to contact us on twitter  if you have any more questions! 
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:32:14
Agreed. It's on our list. :)

@_date: 2015-05-24 16:36:06
The payments *are* adjusted every second. This still does not change anything with respect to # of transactions pushed to the blockchain. The only additional load it puts on the system is people making payments they otherwise wouldn't have (aka, more commerce happening through bitcoin), and the fact that this requires two TX per financial transaction. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:39:02
As it is right now, the only thing limiting scale is the bandwidth of the video content provider. For an average connection, that means you'll probably top out at 4-5 simultaneous connections.

For a few months now I've been wondering why it seemed that no one else saw the concept of antifragility as deeply relevant to bitcoin and its philosphy and history to this point. Now it finally has seemed to catch on. I think it's much more than a buzzword. I think the concept has much descriptive power as well as prescriptive relevance (i.e. it is better to embrace challenges as they arise and gain from them than to sweep them or hide them away, or protect Bitcoin through other means and make it more fragile)
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:54:17
Well, above you started by saying transactions were down 41% from november, and I put that in context beyond just two months. Now you're talking about it being "basically flat over the last year", so let's talk about the last year: 
Checking the graph, USD transaction volume 1 year ago today was 4M USD. The last data point shows it's at 94M USD, or an increase of 23x. More importantly, you see a clear positive trend line on this log scale chart showing exponential growth (with two peaks for each of the two media-driven price manias, with the transaction volume post bubble in each case being significantly higher than before). 
Perhaps a valid criticism you could level is that the price went up 50x but transaction volume only half that... but not that transaction volume is flat. If you do, keep in mind that this year saw the introduction of large widely used services that handle many transactions off-chain (like coinbase), which are not included in these stats. I, for one, would say about one third of my transactions this year have been on Coinbase (including sending and receiving btc from friends and family and the check out process on purchases), so completely off the blockchain. It'd be interesting if Coinbase released this data to make an aggregate data set. 
As for merchant adoption driving consumer adoption, there is not simple one-way causation (in that direction or the other). It's a bunch of feedback loops, and media attention is part of the process.

Streamium doesn't host any content, so we can't block or censor or respond to take downs because there is nothing to take down. You also don't even need Streamium.io, it's open source so you could do it yourself. 
Having said all that, this is a beta and I would seriously discourage anyone from using it for anything illegal as it probably would not be hard for law enforcement to catch you.

I hear ya. Our priorities were more about pushing a working POC that showed the capabilities of micropayment channels, than a full featured site. Also, having a directory (list of active streams), would require full time employees to work compliance and community rules enforcement and deal with DMCA take downs-- which is impossible on a budget of $0 as this is just a hackathon project up to now. 
If you want to see it in action, you can simply set up a stream, and then connect to the same stream in another tab. Since you'd be paying yourself, you'll only lose a couple fractions of a millibit in miner fees.

Here's some of the ideas we've had:

@_date: 2015-05-22 13:32:59
We're working on it... or it might already be fixed.

That's a fantastic idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:33:44
I know USD transaction volume kills your point, hence I use it. :) But it's not arbitrary. Here's why: 
When we measure GDP, say of the US, we put the number in USD. But when talking about how much a country produced, what matters is the actual good and services it produced, not some aggregate number. But it's not practical to say "last year we produced 17 trillion tons of corn, 843,404 ford fiestas, 1,120,564 tax preparations of H&amp;R Block, 423,681,120 haircuts, 3 Aircraft carriers,.........." so we take the market value of all those goods and services and add them up. Right? Right.
Now if in one year we produced a certain amount of all goods and services, and the next year we produce the *exact* same amount, but all prices are 10% higher, would we say the economy was 10% more productive? No! That would be inflation, which is why we keep track of a CPI and usually adjust GDP to inflation when we compare numbers, otherwise we'd come up with misleading numbers, like that the US economy is 50x larger now than it was in 1950 (true in nominal terms, not in real terms). 
So why do I look at bitcoin transaction volume in US dollars when looking at a time-series and not in bitcoin? For this exact reason (but in the opposite direction). There is massive price deflation in bitcoin at the moment (10,000btc for a pizza to 0.01btc in just 3.5 years), so we need to adjust for it. But there is no CPI for the "bitcoin economy". However, we have an acceptable shortcut: the USD. The USD has 2% price inflation targeting and it is about as it good as it gets worldwide, so it gives us a way of accounting for value in a roughly stable way (especially on a short time horizon, like 5 years). (For example, if talking about Argentina's GDP now vs. 5 years ago, no one would talk about it in ARS [pesos], they'd convert it to USD, otherwise you'd imply the economy grew 10x.)
So if BTC transaction volume was 200,000 BTC one year ago, and it is 100,000 BTC now, that's interesting for it's own sake, but it doesn't tell us about the total economic value transferred. If we had a CPI, we could would adjust by the CPI. But we don't, so let's do the next best thing and use the USD. 200,000 BTC x 15USD/BTC = 3,000,000 USD. And 100,000BTC x 800USD/BTC = 80,000,000 USD. So that implies a growth of 2566%. If we wanted to be more precise, USD(Feb 2013) = 1.02xUSD(Feb 2014), so adjusting for the USD CPI, we get an estimated increase in the total economic value of blockchain transaction volume of 2514%. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:07:44
No, they taxed it. You can deduct costs, but it only "subsidizes" it in the sense that it taxes it less. Since mining can be done anywhere in the world, this will encourage mining operations to leave the US. (Mining in the US won't go to zero because there are some advantages, but just like most other industries, the government has effectively incentivized an industry to take most of their production offshore).

I'll take the liberty to make a suggestion: I don't know how you guys stand on the whole millibits vs bits vs µBTC discussion, but if you're pro-'bits' (which would make sense for a tipping service), it'd be cool if you skipped a step and just displayed the balance in bits. And while you're at it, make it so when the changetip bot verifies a tip, that it display the amount in bits instead of 'milli-bitcoins'.

@_date: 2015-05-24 15:56:22
1) Safari doesn't support webRTC so it's a non-starter there
2) This is partially true: if the broadcast ends properly (provider or client clicks "end"), the transaction (which includes the payment and the change back to the client) should be broadcasted immediately. However, if, say, the povider's computer crashes (or they close the tab) and they lose the transactions, the only way for the client to recover the funds that were held in "escrow", is to broadcast the nLockTime transaction 24hrs later. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:21:04
That might be it. Also, we discovered a problem and fixed it about 15min ago, so it might have been that.

You think you're being very smart and economically academic, but you're ignoring something any serious economist would use to explain a drop in btc purchases (I'm assuming you're correct about this drop): the wealth effect. People are going to buy less when their wealth has fallen 20 to 80%. Since btc purchases these days represent purchases by bitcoin fans and investors, this is an important factor. Btw,  The wealth effect is a good reason why deflationary spirals won't occur. If you want a good argument against deflation, stick with the fact that people think nominally and would have a hard time accepting a falling nominal wage (even if it has greater purchasing power). I don't believe that, but it's the best argument. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:37:37
Streamium does not host any content. The connection is handled completely between the provider and the client's browsers. Since the video stream does not pass through Streamium's server (it doesn't even have one) and Streamium does not handle any funds, it cannot enforce content rules. HOWEVER! Do not use it for illegal purposes-- this is not just a CYA thing to say-- nothing about the platform guarantees you privacy and this is just a beta. If you do illegal stuff, your traffic probably will get sniffed by three-letter agencies and that'll be on you.
So keep it legal and have fun!

What this means is that if we are aware of an attack, (like say the government building large Asic farms), we can go back to the last known block that was untainted and start a new chain using a pow algo that readers those Asics obsolete.

I have a question what will be the interaction between the Coinbase Exchange and the traditional Coinbase broker service? 
In other words, before I could go to coinbase and buy bitcoin, and Coinbase would turn around and buy bitcoin at Bitstamp. Now will coinbase use its own exchange exclusively? Are there any fairness implications of Coinbase trading on its own exchange?

Yeah, that's why I didn't think the "the thieves cashed out all at once and crashed the price" theory was valid.

That's why I'm saying the price fall came from other selling--namely, those first people who knew about the hack.

@_date: 2014-10-01 00:47:20
meh.... even *if* it's not strictly correct, I think it's fair to call this a mesh network and p2p messaging service. At least it's a good proof of concept and a big wake up call to the world: "Hey! We can communicate with each other despite government attempts to shut us down!" It's a powerful idea.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:54:13
Of course I don't have proof. I'm theorizing, given two facts: price drop yesterday, and tip posts on reddit today saying their hot wallet was hacked. I have no idea if they have enough money to cover the loss, or if they have insurance or whatever. I do wish they'd communicate more to the community 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:41:48
Something like that
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:52:20

@_date: 2015-01-26 15:52:30
I've been wondering about that. Is it seriously a lie or is there some technicality they're relying on to say that?
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:33:30
I know how fractional reserve works: exactly as you said, which is in complete agreement with how I wrote my comment. 
If you think Bitstamp ran a fractional reserve longer than what I'm saying, then ok-- that's why I used the conditional phrasing "*if* the hack was indeed yesterday, *then*..."
Nothing you said contradicts what I said. The "clearly you do not understand" was wrong and unnecessary. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:22:45
Yup, the Illinois government did absolutely nothing wrong taking *and keeping* money that did not belong to them. And MA's take first, ask questions later approach is perfectly sound, because fortunately, this person had enough money out of the country to not become suddenly destitute.

Hi, Streamium team member here. Thanks for giving it a try. Like Esteban said before, we're working on these issues. 
I just wanted to mention that (in reference to your  the minimum is not $1 per hour. The minimum rate possible is the equivalent in USD/hr of one satoshi per second. That's about $0.005 per hour. 
The rate you choose will usually change slightly by the time you start your stream because of bitcoin's fluctuating exchange rate (and to a smaller extent because of rounding). 
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:52:08
Got the email, added it to the list. Thanks!

That's exactly what I figured you interpreted, so that's why I clarified in my previous message that that is NOT what I'm saying. However, it seems you're just glossing over what I read instead of investing 14-17 seconds and actually reading what I wrote. 
EDIT: Just so we don't do another round in this misinterpretation-carousel, here's an example of what I mean:
Say I think oil is going down to 40usd a barrel in the next month, and I'm sure of it. But then say today it starts at $54, and at noon some 2nd level Saudi Arabian minister comes out and says "We're gonna have a meeting with OPEC about cutting production". The price suddenly jumps up to $61. However, I think they're full of shit, and the price will indeed keep going down to $40. **Even though I think the price will go down in the medium term, it is still a valid point to say "The price jumped up $9 on rumors of a production cut by OPEC"** Do you finally get it?

Yup, whenever satoshi comes out and speaks and tell us he's gonna set a price floor at 600 and then it goes below, we all still lavish praise on him. /s
I knew someone was gonna make this dumbass comment. Do you not see the difference?

At this time there is not directory or gallery of current streams. We are considering it for the future. The preview idea is good, but could be abused. The good news is if you connect and disconnect quickly, the amount of money you pay is minimal, unless the content is priced at $1000/hr
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:04:48
Up to this point, it has been a hackathon project. As it hardly has any expenses in its current incarnation, we have no problem in sharing it with everyone for free.

Hey dumbfuck, read the post: "If a country adopted bitcoin as their national currency, would the US still be able to declare bitcoin a commodity?" 
It's a hypothetical. Of course it's speculating. You saying "it's never gonna happen" is also speculation, btw. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:28:28
Yeah, you pre-fund an escrow address which basically determines the maximum length of your stream. If you end it early, you pay only the fraction you viewed, broken down to the second.
@_date: 2015-05-22 00:58:33
Yeah, for now it's just live streaming of your webcam but the potential is there for a ton of other stuff. We're definitely looking into it. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:04:27
Nah man. If the hack was indeed yesterday (it'd be pretty brazen to lie that directly) then bitstamp ran fractional reserve for at most 12 to 24hrs, then halted operations. On the other hand gox ran a fractional reserve for anywhere between 2 and 24 months! 
Edit: which isn't to say this isn't bad or can't get worse. Just clarifying the difference. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:34:00
Here's my other post on the subject: 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:43:01
Oh, I guess I was thrown off by the use of the word "illegal"
@_date: 2014-01-22 05:34:42
Thanks for trying to protect us, You're so selfless and kind! 
As for his handwaving, is it any worse than what you just wrote above?
Here's a coherent and well written critique of Andreessen's piece: 
Unfortunately, like your trolling, it falls far short of being persuasive. Here's the tl;dr of that article: 
1. Analogies aren't proofs (duh).
2. We don't know who Satoshi is, therefore scary!
3. Bitcoin markets are illiquid so spreads can be larger than 2-3% cc fees (ignoring that merchants have options like bitpay that guarantee the exchange rate and deposit usd for 1% flat.)
4. 25 BTC reward is kinda like a built-in hidden fee (amazing how detractors suddenly care about monetary M1 inflation, but only when talking about bitcoin... that is, of course, when they're not complaining that it's deflationary)
5. No chargeback leaves buyer exposed. (hmmm... what other system is like that? Oh, right, cash/paper money/benjamins greenbacks/etc. Except this one can go large distances, no need to put a wad of paper in the mail).
6. Really cool mediation and 2-of-3 transactions are possible in bitcoin but I will ignore them since they are a few months away (however, negative future possibilities will be considered!)
7. Thefts have occurred! Mercy me! And as we all know, thefts in fiat never happen, because once a normal user of government currency experiences theft, our benevolent governments shut down the whole system as it is deemed flawed and useless. 
8. Zerocoin might be created in the future, therefore bitcoin is untraceable today.
9. M-Pesa exists in one country, therefore a global, borderless, decentralized, asset/currency/payment system is irrelevant because no one needs to send money from one country to another, just cell phone to cell phone within borders.
10. And finally, the awesome conclusion: It won't replace the Dollar, Euro or Renminbi (btw, what about the other 190 shitty currencies?), but it's awesome, forget everything I said!

People who are in the middle probably mostly don't post everyday and get involved in these discussions. We just have our reasonable amount of bitcoin, most of us don't look at the price every day, and we just go about our lives, while also trying to advance the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 10:46:26
They don't, that's why you have companies like Bitpagos who take on that risk for a fee (a practice commonly referred to as "business") :P
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:45:26
Hm... Which OS is this?
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:36:58
The TX is updated every second, with a ~15second buffer. So the risk is the length of that buffer. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:04:22
The only people that are able to buy right now on the exchange are people who had previously funded their USD wallet on coinbase, which I suspect is far fewer than those that had Bitcoins in their Coinbase wallet (or were able to quickly send in from another source between yesterday and today). Thus you have a ton of people with BTC to sell, and very few people with USD to buy on the exchange.

Thanks for the answer! 
So although you didn't write it explicitly, I guess that means Coinbase.com is only (or mostly) using Coinbase Exchange from now on to source BTC (with all the proper controls and firewalls between exchange operators and exchange help desk). 
That was my main questions because that means Coinbase Exchange will have a built in liquidity coming from Coinbase.com purchases, and at the same time Bitstamp should see a fall in liquidity. 
One more question: will you allow US "Competitors" to exchange on the Coinbase Exchange, such as Bitpay? (I use quotes because while you do compete, the bitcoin space is far from zero sum right now as we try to get Bitcoin adoption to... the moon). Again, I ask because this would imply even more liquidity on the exchange.

@_date: 2015-01-06 14:24:34
$20 per share??? Each share is 1/5 of a bitcoin. So... $100 bitcoins? 
1. Buy COIN ETFs for $100
2. Take delivery of underlying bitcoin
3. Sell bitcoin at ~~mtgox~~ ~~bistamp~~ coinbase for $270
4. Profit 
(No "???" step because this would be straight up arbitrage!)
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:59:12
ok. So you have a long term theory about the bear market (or your a bitcoin troll and think it's going to zero, whichever). You have a theory, I have a theory. Yours is long term, mine is about the price movement yesterday. They're not mutually exclusive. Do you see what I'm getting at?

I think it's safe to say most bitstamp employees use bitstamp, like most coinbase employees use coinbase, and most chase bank employees use chase, and most GM employees drive GM cars, etc. While some might have another exchange setup, I don't think that's the norm. 
Here's a quick dialog of how I think it went down:

Thank you for all the love! We're definitely considering a lot of the suggestions you listed. Our first objective though was to launch a working proof of concept, even if it wasn't fully featured.

We're working on ways to make this more robust so that simply closing a tab isn't so catastrophic. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:11:59
We're still working on getting those errors working consistently, but it's most likely that stream is offline at the moment (the live/offline status is self-reported). Check Twitter also for streams.
If you want to test, the easiest way is to just create a stream in one browser window and connect to it in another. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:26:32
Yes, unfortunately, for now, when you close a tab or refresh, chances are you'll lose coins. We're looking for ways to make it more robust. The viewers who were currently connected should have been given a message with a raw transaction-- if they take that transaction and push it to the blockchain in 24hrs, they should receive their coins back. 
As for your balance, you probably lost the coins you earned from those currently connected, but not from those that had previously connected and ended their broadcast properly. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 04:19:20
Yeah that's true. You've managed to bum me out a bit. But we're definitely not out to try to circumvent the law or anything. We're not hosting anything just because we don't have any money! :P If we were we'd comply with take-down notices, etc. 
But Streamium is open source, so taking down streamium.io would do nothing to actually prevent people from connecting if they have a copy.

@_date: 2015-08-22 22:33:14
Imagine Bitcoin lives 40 years. It's 2055 and suddenly a couple generations of core devs go through and now there 3 guys in charge, and the community finds out they have been compromised by the world government and they're actively planning to cripple Bitcoin. You're saying it's against "the rules" to do a hostile fork to take the power away from them? 
No you don't. 
What you have to realize is that "consensus" doesn't mean "unanimous decision of the developers". Consensus is ugly and hard. I've participated in ISO technical committies that work on consensus (voting is strictly prohibited). Sometimes you hit a wall where two people hold opposing opinions, and you can't move forward. From that point on the solution becomes totally political. Sometimes it results in that particular issue being removed (if that's a possibility), or sometimes the commity is closed and that particular standard is dropped, or the committee divides in two to try to find other solutions. 
My point is that it is precisely the fact that anyone can push a fork out to the community and the community can choose to follow it, that encourages the devs to follow the (admitted hard to ascertain) consensus will of the community. 
We have one such situation now. Bitcoin will get through this (regardless of whether xt is adopted or not), and learn a lot from the experience. I predict devs will also be more weary of ignoring issues the community cares deeply about. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:08:25
Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
As for what these forks would include, I imagined making the earlier ones trivial. Maybe something that hard forks, but doesn't actually change anything substantial at all. So it would be laser focused on getting everybody up to speed on what happens when there's a hard fork. 
But yes, I get it, you're anti-hard forks... 
And you'll stay anti-hard forks.... until you're not anymore, because some day some change will come along that you *will* like (for example, making sidechains possible), and perhaps at that point, with a $25B market cap, and tens of millions more users, you and the rest of us will look back longingly and wish we'd done a dry run back in the good old days when we were just a few hundred thousand dudes arguing with each other on reddit with only a $4B market cap. Instead we'll have a nice fragile system that can't stand the tiniest shock (or threat of a shock), without convulsions and panicking and risking everything crumbling down (just as the fragile international banking industry couldn't deal with a measly 10% drop in house prices in the US in 2008).
You don't have to agree with me immediately, just mull it over for a few months. Also, read Antifragile by  Taleb. It's not a bible or anything, just an interesting framework or lens through which to see how systems deal with shocks. 
Edit: autocorrect 
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:47:52
I respect Gregory Maxwell a lot, and don't mean to compare my knowledge to his, but I do feel compelled to point out that his understanding of what being antifragile means is completely flawed (as evidenced by his link purporting to describe where antifragility comes from), which might explain his extreme aversion to forks. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:21:05
I think it's incredibly relevant to Bitcoin, as it is a new technology and by design it will be attacked from many angles for the next decade. When I read antifragile in 2013 I couldn't help but relate every page to Bitcoin. I recommend that book to everyone here.
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:44:53
Yeah, I know. :D I'm not saying he followed my plan... I just remembered I had had that interaction and felt it was at least relevant in this crazy week. 
I still stand by my idea. Whether or not XT succeeds, I think what I suggested is still valid. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:25:16
OP here. This is exactly why I suggested what I did. "We choose to fork not because it is easy, but because it is hard", you could say :D 
The idea is there's a million things to deal with and issues that would have to be taken care of. Doing this in the context of non contentious forks planned well in advance will prepare us for future emergencies. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:16:06
This is exactly why I suggest practice is necessary. As the community has more and more of these under its belt, it'll be better prepared to deal with future unintended ones or crisis situations that require a hard fork quickly (say, sha256 is compromised or something like that, to give but one example of known and unknown millions of possibilities.)
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:43:11
OP here. It's precisely *because* it's hard and risky that I believe we should practice hard forks. Hard forks WILL be necessary in the future, with out any doubt (even sidechains and lightning network require hard forks to work). Some of those hard forks will have to be done in a hurry (in the next couple decades a key piece of crypto could be vulnerable... Actually, nsa just came out and said sha256 shouldn't be used [and yes, I know, I don't trust them either]). 
Avoiding hard forks like the plague is like not running fire drills or evacuation drills on a boat because there's a risk of someone getting hurt, or because it's hard to organize them. Sure, Bitcoin is more complicated, and deals with a lot of value, but in the future it will only be more complicated, more valuable, and have more stakeholders. Let's practice now while it's small! 
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:15:03

@_date: 2015-08-19 16:43:12

@_date: 2015-07-23 02:40:15
Which reduces the incentive to join a large pool, no? Thus encouraging the hashrate to distribute more evenly among pools. Either way the existence of block withholding attack (or potential attacks) pushes in the directions of decentralization.

I can understand your frustration if you feel like defining bitcoin as a currency/asset/something else is like trying to hit a moving target. This is for a good pair of reasons: 
1. It does not, in fact, fit any current definition for currency/money/asset/etc (hell, how do you even define ownership? "in possession of a code that allows me to transfer an output from one part of the ledge to another?" This is complicated stuff!)
2. It is not currently widely used/accepted/held, is in a process of exponentially paced adoption and has a value that is anything but stable. 
 seems to be most people's concerns, but it doesn't bother me one iota. It's semantics. We have something that blurs the lines of the categories we used to use... it's gonna take some time to adjust. Arguments over whether its a currency/asset/money sounds a lot like someone in the late 80s trying to define whether the internet is an *electronic mailing delivery system* or a *multi-person voiceless telephone platform*. *It's not a telephone! It uses telephones! But you send packets! But they're electronic!* It takes time to incorporate new concepts into the shared consciousness. 
 Is why I feel comfortable calling it a currency. Sure it does not fit "a system of money in general use in a particular country" in more ways than one (Money? general use? in? a particular country?). But "in general use" is, in my opinion a matter of time, being "in" a country is now irrelevant, particular country is impossible. 
Was the Euro a "currency" after  16-dec 1995 when it was officially adopted but not used? 1-Jan 1999 when it became used by world financial markets but there were no notes? Or 1-Jan 2002 when notes entered circulation? Or a few weeks/months/years later when everyone became used to them and start using any other alternatives? Well... who cares? Did people really object to calling it a currency before 1-Jan 2002? Also note that Bitcoin takes this model and puts it on its head: it releases the notes (payment system, Bitcoin) first, then builds everything else later. 
So yeah, currency, not currency. The word needs to be redefined. Until then I don't really care if some people use it when they write on their "typewriter television sets" or not.

This is the best defense of Bitcoin I've ever read. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:26:30
I like that you are defending the position that deflation is bad while explicitly excluding the deflationary spiral aspect. This is good. 
I also like that you distinguish among ventures of different ROI and between debt for production and consumer debt, although I differ on whether consumer debt (especially in housing and education) has been a net positive or net negative because of the enormous bubbles it has inflated. 
My response to your main concern about investment funds is that, as pointed out below, I never excluded equity. While debt and equity might serve very similar functions in funding a venture, there is a world of difference. I believe you'll see a lot of investment in a potential stable-deflationary "bitcoin economy", just almost none in the form of debt. Hell, if they just removed the tax in incentive for taking on debt as a corporation we'd see a *drastic* reduction in the level of debt. 
Finally, and this is not a criticism directed at you in particular, but when discussing bitcoin people often default to *Bitcoin vs. US Dollar*. But it's not. It's a large market and it's more like: *bitcoin vs. US Dollar and Euro and Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso and Yen and Yuan and Gold and Silver and.... in addition to Bitcoin vs. Western Union and Paypal and SWIFT and ACH and Moneygram and and and and....*
I don't mean they're enemies, but rather that bitcoin is a borderless currency/payment protocol and competes on many different fronts. Will it "beat" the US Dollar and history of predictable inflation? Maybe not. Will it "beat" the venezuela's "Strong" Bolivar, with it's history of debasement? Will it beat Wester Union and it's business model of extracting billions from the world's poorest? Well....... 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:26:57
"money can no longer be devalued by anyone anywhere." 
Your willful US centric pseudo knowledge must be very comforting to you, meanwhile the Argentine peso is being devalued against the US dollar (the reserve currency of the world) as we speak. Tell Argentines who in a few month can buy 40% less on world markets with their currency that no money can be devalued (inflation holding steady at 30% by the way). 
US population = 300 million. Don't forget about the almost 7 billion other poor souls on earth. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:01:17


I think a lot of the damage comes from the fact that the government encourages debt by giving it favorable tax status. This makes businesses and whole industries more vulnerable to catastrophic fluctuations by making them more fragile. 


That's one part of it (a big one for now!). But (humor me) as it reaches peak adoption, the price will stabilize and deflate (in terms of price level) at a gentile pace (probably in proportion with the growth of the "bitcoin economy"), even then, I argue,  debt denominated in bitcoin will be low. Why? Because you need to borrow to finance a venture that will return more than (at least) the rate of deflation (plus the interest rate). Also, because there probably won't be tax incentives to taking on debt in bitcoin. 


Not that it would be harder (it might in fact be easier: less paperwork, using distributed ledgers for document signing like in proofofexistence.com, etc. etc.), I just argue because of the price and the knowledge of a generally decreasing price level people will *choose* to take on less debt.
If you removed credit from the economy now, sure, those things you list might suffer. But first, I don't know that debt for housing and education have been net positives for society (a very strong argument can be made that they've been terrible). Second, I do think business financing will move more toward equity than debt. Absolutely. But I don't know that there will be less investment per se. I do agree it will shift and investment will be much heavier in industries with greater returns.


I think the level of deflation (or appeciation of bitcoin) is not "normal". What I mean is we're simply seeing the market quickly (on the order of single digit number of years) trying to find the "true" price level of bitcoin. I do not think bitcoin is 5000% more useful than it was a year ago. I think a perfectly plausible model is that if it's eventual price level is 100%, last year we were at 0.1% and this year we're at 7% (yeah, I'm bullish). I suspect it the price will end up reflecting a typical S-curve style of adoption we see in the tech sector all the time. 


Okay. 


This I find is a common misconception. First of all, the current price has the probability that it goes to 0, 2000 and 1 million all baked in, to put it crudely. I, as a bull, think bitcoin is going up to $100,000, then yeah, *if couldn't spend if I couldn't replace those coins*. But I can, so I spend freely. Again, this is during the exponential adoption phase of bitcoin, so the contrast is stark. When bitcoin stabalizes and I have to choose whether I want my PS4 or to have 1.001xPS4's in a month... I'll just buy the damn thing. But I might think twice about buying 50 games I'll never use. 


Again, Krugman/Trolls, not Krugman Trolls. The handwaving I was referring to was when they say deflation will be catastrophic to bitcoin the way it was in the Great Depression, etc. My point is there were specific reasons and mechanisms by which deflation proved so lethal which are not present in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:03:34
I actually, don't see this view as being any different than mine as a supporter/proponent! Even though I've invested in bitcoin I continue to see its end result as binary: 0-- total failure, 1-- smashing success. It's all speculation, absolutely. But you're right to recognize that it's like twitter 2006, or more appropriately (since twitter is centralized) like the internet in the early nineties: difficult to use, not clear any lay-user will actually want to use it, but definitely powerful and full of potential. This OP simply argues that failure will probably not come from one of the most often touted aspects ('feature' to proponents, 'bug' to detractors), it's deflationary tendency.

@_date: 2013-12-30 14:55:00
Hey, thanks for your comment! I might ramble a bit in my response; I apologize: 
First of all, reading all the replies it's clear I should have defined better which arguments I was trying to counter (and also I shouldn't have used the word "trolls," it was needlessly inflammatory). The one that I find most baffling goes something like this:
* Bitcoin has an systemic flaw which is deflation. Since it deflates, no one will use the currency because they will only want to hoard it, and therefore it will cease to be a useful currency and it will fail. [Prime example of this comes from this comment,  "When all 21 million of them have been mined, the ceiling disappears. The currency is now free to deflate infinitely and is no longer a good store of value."]
So I guess the logic of this is either: 
1. Bitcoins are finite, so the value will continue to increase, 
2. Increasing value is bad, so the value will decrease as people don't use the currency; 
which sounds more like an equilibrium than a failure that ends in the abandonment of bitcoins. Or, worse, as the case of the comment I linked to above:
1. Bitcoins are finite, so the value will continue to increase.
2. Increasing value is bad, so it will continue to be hoarded instead of spent and the value will increase forever in a deflationary spiral
3. ????
4. Bad store of value.
This one is truly baffling. Does store of value exclude assets that go up in value infinitely? Does such an asset even exist? Could it? 
The other common argument goes something like this (or I feel implies something like this):
1. Bitcoin is deflationary
2. Deflation is bad because of the experience of the Great Depression and Japan in the 90s
3. Therefore, Bitcoin is bad and won't be adopted. 
For this one, my argument in the OP is that there is a missing or implied step 2.5 where you have to argue that the conditions that led to deflation being bad in those periods will be repeated in the bitcoin economy. I posit that those would be debt denominated in bitcoins (and a big one I missed completely: fractional reserve), wages denominated in bitcoins, and prices set in bitcoins. Since these aren't the case, I argue that adoption will not be stopped by the threat of deflationary spirals, while at the same time avoiding those highly dangerous aspects (mainly, debts denominated in bitcoin, but also fixed wages in bitcoins, long term pricing contracts denominated in bitcoins, etc.), thus avoiding the conditions necessary to recreate a deflationary spiral/lost decade/depression. Of course this is speculation, I just submit that it's more plausible than speculation that suddenly everyone will be highly leveraged in bitcoin and a bitcoin-depression will occur. 
Finally, here's my main takeaway: people and businesses will have to choose to use/hold/sell/become involved with bitcoin; no one is proposing switching the currency over by law (like was done with cruceiros/reais [Brazil], australes/pesos [Argentina], national currencies/euros) to bitcoin and changing the denominations of all existing contracts. THAT would truly be a recipe for disaster right along the lines of what I imagine Krugman sees, but won't be how this plays out. 
Edit: Some commas, and dumb errors, like writing inflation instead of deflation.

Good question. Unfortunately, I don't have a great answer: I simply investigated as much as I could and found that they were well regarded and that the consensus is that the way it guards your passwords is fundamentally sound (it's all client side, etc.) Like I said, I'd love to have more to go by, but it was kinda the limits of my knowledge at the time I picked them (in any case it was waaayyyyy better than what I had before, just 3 or 4 different passwords for all my stuff). If I set it all up again today I might use keepass as that seems to be more popular in the hard-core crypto/bitcoin circles, but again even though it's open source I'd simply be trusting other people's judgements and not verifying it for myself. Again, I emphasize "unfortunately". 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:28:40
Oh ok so "specific identification" is a system like FIFO, except that you have to elect it before hand. Two thoughts on this: 
First, Specific Identification treats each Bitcoin differently and in essence works against fungibility of bitcoin (like coinvalidation). So I'm not crazy about it off the bat, even though it might be profitable. 
Second, it might not work because most people who buy or sell go through an exchange or a service like localbitcoins. However, when you do that, you deposit coins and those coins go into a shared hot wallet, so you don't get back the same coins if you withdraw, and you don't sell those specific coins if you sell. I don't know how this might affect this all, but it's something to keep in mind.
Finally, I appreciate the idea of software that tracks all your bitcoin holdings and gives you a always-up-to-date view of your position and tax liability... very cool stuff.

I agree, especially with your last sentence. I think the idea of using some sort of separator is the key, and I'm open to which to use. I probably like spaces and semi-colons the best, because they're standard symbols and don't require any special manipulation of the text (like subscript or superscript). 
Spaces worry me, though, because while they're great for lists of numbers (like old log or normal dist lookup tables), they might become confusing in blocks of text (where you expect a space to separate to different concepts, like words or different numbers). 
I like semi-colons because it looks like one cohesive number, and because it is a mix of the two most popular decimal delimiters and thousands separators: a comma and a period. Thus it would work for in either system (i.e. 1,000.000;000;00 in the US or 1.000,000;000;00 in parts of europe, south america, etc.)

Reading that wikipedia article, I'm not sure if what I'm referring to is currency substitution per se. And I am not referring to currencies that are pegged (like the argentine peso in the 90s). What I mean is where a person's pay is defined in Dollars, but paid in the local currency. Like say I live in a high inflation country, I might negotiate once a year a salary in dollars, and each month have the salary in the local currency adjusted for the new exchange rate. That way my purchasing power isn't eroded and we don't need to renegotiate several times per year. (As I mentioned before, this is not widespread, mostly executives, foreigners, artists, etc.)

@_date: 2013-12-30 05:49:25
This is true. There is an enormous difference between bitcoin being simply a competitor in the world market for currencies and being a replacement for all of them. 
I would argue that my point still stands: in such a world, I don't see people becoming indebted at the current rates because they will know full well going into it that it will be hard if not impossible to pay back. 
However, I'll step back and say that as big of a proponent as I am of bitcoin, I do not see it replacing all currencies (or it being the exclusive currency of any country). Why? Because if the concept is successful, by definition it will always have competitors because the Blockchain concept will have been validated and the barriers to entry or so small as to be non-existent (see: dogecoin). Also, because we see this, adoption as a world currency might even be tempered due to the perception of this potential problem.
But I do appreciate your comment and the distinction you present. If these critics would make their arguments in that manner ("Bitcoin is fine, though I could see some potential problems if it became the only currency in the world"), I would not have a problem (or as much of a problem) with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:58:47
It's not important to have support of people like Krugman (and In fact, I'm of the opinion that having very strong dissenting voices actually benefits Bitcoin in the long run because it makes it more resilient through antifragility ( 
While can be a bit of an echo chamber (aka circlejerk), the reality is Bitcoin faces immense opposition worldwide (from pundits, but also hackers seeking to compromise it, governments seeking to control/destroy/contain it, entrenched interests like bank seeking to defeat it, etc.) and if (yes, *if*; I don't think anyone truly believes success is a forgone conclusion) it survives all that, it'll be stronger for it. 
Far from being protected like fragile ultra-leveraged too-big-to-fail banks ( Bitcoin can take all this abuse and not only survive but thrive.

In response to Schiff saying nobody gets paid a salary pegged to one currency yet delivered in another currency: he holds this false belief simply because he's used to the first world (US/Europe, etc).

I'll give you that, but it's not important, because beyond their bitcoin holdings, they have no power over Bitcoin. There is no backdoor. The source code is completely open source. 
I do sympathize with detractors, because having Satoshi Nakamoto be identified would make it much easier to attack bitcoin by way of ad hominem attacks. I'm sure we'll quickly find out he's a pedopyronecrobeastophiliac terrorist. :)


I'll also give you that. It is absolutely speculative, no doubt. We are speculating on it's potential AND its probability of success, to complete unknowns. Those of us who take this incredible risk might reap incredible rewards or tremendous losses. We'll see! 


"*That literally will not work, AND if it somehow did, it would be horribly economically crippling*." It's these kinds of statements that drove me to write the OP. If that's your final word, we'll just have to see what happens!

Are you under the impression that the only cases of deflation have been Japan in the 90s and the Great Depression? Because reading Krugman's Economics textbook, you might come away with that idea, so I sympathize. 
However, the US had deflation all throughout the 1800s (with the exception of the Civil War period) and the incidence of recessions was about the same as it has been since the introduction of the Fed. This also coincided with the rise of the US as a backwards agrarian irrelevant nation to eventual superpower. Nothing to sneeze at. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:28:32
No, I think you have that backwards. Ceteris paribus, it assumes the money supply is growing at 0%, thus 10% growth in the economy would require 10% in the value of the currency stock. This is overly simplified, but probably a good approximation @_date: 2013-12-29 16:39:16

That's partially what I argue.

Is your whole opinion of bitcoin based on just people who own it being deceptive and trying to pump the value and hide some awful truth? Is there no possibility that they honestly feel they've evaluated the technology/the system/the idea and feel it is just beginning to be adopted? 
Have you ever seen any asset growing exponentially that was more open and face bigger headwinds? Have there ever been 5 year decentralized, distributed, open source, completely transparent pump-and-dump schemes before?

@_date: 2013-12-30 14:13:08
I see what you're saying, but I have a couple thoughts. First of all, your thinking is very much in line with what mine was until recently, so I understand what you mean completely. But I've started looking at things a little differently now, a little more meta, if you will. For example, leaving aside credit for business, you bring up 
* Housing
* Education
* Medicine
I look at that and I look at that list and I think, while I agree with you that for an individual at this moment it is essential that s/he have access to credit to be able to afford these things, but could we say ex-ante before all the easy credit that we'd do it all over if we knew the unbelievable bubbles we'd create? So in the end did credit end up helping or hurting people trying to get an education? I won't say I have a definitive answer, but I think a strong case can be made against it. 
As for business credit, I agree that financing is essential, but I don't agree that financing would dry up. Keep in mind that businesses take on massive debt now and become highly leveraged (when they can) because there is a strong tax-incentive to become indebted-- namely, you can deduct interest payments from corporate taxes. Would the debt burden be as high absent this incentive? Absolutely not. But it's not an unintended consequence. It's on purpose to encourage businesses to seek loans. But again, ex-ante, seeing what debt and leveraging can do to entire economic and business sector does in the face of even a slight downturn, are we sure we want such a policy? Is it beneficial to society to have businesses be so fragile by mandate? 
I'll leave you with those thoughts and not a definitive answer. Let's keep talking! Thanks for your response btw!

Actually, in one sense they're not-- you can trace back each fraction of a bitcoin's entire history. That's why bitcoiners (including me) made such a fuss about Coinvalidation.com, because it attacked bitcoins' fungibility. Essentially, if a government says, it's illegal to receive bitcoins that have ever been through the following address, 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX, then you would start fracturing Bitcoin and destroying the fungibility of all bitcoins. I could see a future where only certain bitcoins are accepted in certain countries and for certain purposes. Since you're very intent on attacking bitcoin, here's your main attack vector. You're welcome.
Edit: I gotta say, this comment of yours is quite disappointing. I thought I'd finally found a critic of Bitcoin that was actually well informed, but it seems like you're not since you didn't know something so basic. I'd encourage you to read up, maybe starting with  Think of it as a know-thine-enemy sort of thing.

I agree. All the posts saying this is actually good news (like the realization that came a few hours after the SR shutdown) are stretching it at best. This is bad news with a little sprinkling of good: 
* Bitcoin is a legitimate asset worthy of a government response; 
* Bitcoin is legal to buy and hold; 
* the exchanges aren't expressly prohibited or shut down). 
Everything else is bad news, unfortunately.

No, I think the distinction between financing your venture with debt vs. equity is very important when discussing the consequences of deflation: With debt, you must maintain nominally fixed (or predetermined) payments; with equity the ups and downs of the economy and/or the currency is directly reflected in the value of the investor's position. In other words, with debt you could fall in a trap where you must "hunker down" and try to make ends meet to meet your obligations, where as with equity the investor is in the same boat as you-- his or her position does not affect the operation of the business.

Exactly. But the worst part is that he's asking his readers to distinguish between normative and positive economics, when he makes a living blurring that line every day. In fact, it's why he instantly disliked Bitcoin the moment he learned of it (judging by his columns, I don't actually know him).

Sorry, I just picked the first definition from the dictionary and used it because it was the worst for my point (i.e. I was trying to not make it easy for myself). In other words, it was the one that bitcoin fit the least into. 


I'm an economist, first of all. Just fyi. So I also don't care about "in a country" (hell, look no farther than the euro). As for *Special* (not Standard) Drawing Right, *oh boy!*, I've been waiting for someone to bring them up! Do you feel it's a currency? It's not in general use, no prices are set in it, nobody uses it... and hey, look at that, (crickets) that's the sound of people complaining about it's definition! hehe.


Woah woah woah. Here's where I have to object strenuously. I agree that one might argue both are evolutionary/revolutionary steps and that each were impactful and fought against and misunderstood, but you cannot say that this is the same as everything that came before. The fact that an algo set the supply and no person, entity, group of people or government can change that is absolutely new. There has never been any currency (fiat or not, backed by gold or not, where somebody or group of somebodies couldn't choose to increase the supply). This truly is a first. 


You seem to have a slight misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. I don't mean this to be insulting, so please don't take offense. The "Hash" doesn't give bitcoins their value. Bitcoin is a secure decentralized distributed ledger. That is valuable. That is new. That is useful. To use this ledger, there is a currency, called bitcoin. Hashes and well known powerful crypto tools allow us to be sure bitcoins are not double spent or forged. The algorithm that controls this all limits the number of bitcoins and thus (and here you are correct) their value in terms of other assets (dollars, products, etc.) is determined by the demand. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:49:11
Perhaps it's not correct to imply Paul Krugman is not intelligent, but I think it is warranted to accuse him of not being academically and intellectually honest with his columns and posts for the NYT as he currently values his political influence much more than truth and nuance.
Edit: For this, just read his 1980 and 1991 paper that got him the Nobel Prize (pseudo nobel or not) and compare it to any random post from the Bush era and any random post from the Obama era. You'll see intellectual curiosity in the first, and disingenuous bashing and cheerleading (respectively) in the other two. He's devolved from an accomplished thinker to a caricature meant to give an feeling of legitimacy to all of the thoughts the NYT readership has. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:06:32
I understand you feel like people change the goal posts on you but it only seems like it because Bitcoin blurs some lines that used to be well defined before. Also, here's a little rule of thumb: usually when discussing Bitcoin the protocol and payment network, people write "Bitcoin" with a capital B (as in Visa, SWIFT, Wester Union). When discussing bitcoin the currency (or asset, unit of account, or whatever), it's usually written with lowercase b (as in dollar, euro, peso). It's not used completely consistency because not everyone (especially critics) are aware of the difference or distinction. 
Finally, I'd like to point to you my response to a comment above, here: 
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:28:15

Hey rumplefistbump, that is a great point about there not being handy separators for numbers on the righthand side of the decimal. There's a threat at bitcointalk about this.
tl;dr What do you think of using a semicolon ";"? i.e. 0.001;190;00 or 1,234.567;890;12
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:28:08
That's a brilliant defense of Krugman. I agree wholeheartedly!  
But you immediately walked right into the centerpiece of my OP:


*Wage stickiness.* I asked for critics to specify how the deflation could cause a crisis if there is not wages(/prices/debt) denominated in bitcoin. 


*Price increases relative to wages.* How is that going to happen when neither prices nor wages are set in bitcoin? That's my question. 
But hey, if bitcoin gets adopted as the official currency of some country and they pass legal tender laws and then require wages be fixed nominally and then set price controls and and and and, then yeah, hello depression. 
Finally, as for debt (*"There is no debt in this story for a reason"*), you seem to forget about the gold standard, the whole point of Krugman's writings on the Great Depression. Also a liquidity trap can still be an issue for sovereign issuers of their own currency if they enter a deflation, because they cannot push nominal interest rates below 0%. That's the zero bound (page 410, "Economics," Krugman, Wells, 2006). That's why central banks prefer to target 2% inflation than 0%, because 0% is a tipping point from which they might not be able to recover. But like I said in the OP, that's in a world where people expect price stability or inflation, and thus deflation is catastrophic. My point was to contrast that with bitcoin where you expect deflation. 
Finally, again going to debt and the Great Depression. You think fractional reserve and bank failures had nothing to do with the crisis?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:07:33
But other than that he's just swell, right? :P
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:30:52
Exactly! If a country decided to make bitcoin their sole currency and keep everything as it was before, I'd urge caution at the very least. But that's not happening. And even if a country took on bitcoin as a second official currency, I don't believe you would see these problems critics foresee... why? because it's not that their current prices/wages/debts would be converted to bitcoin, but rather they would adopt it knowing full well bitcoins deflationary tendency, and (a point I've neglected to mention) full knowledge of future currency emission! No small thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:53:07
That was awesome. It'd be nice if the price graph (top) stayed on the same scale the whole time. Not sure if it would even be possible with bitcoinity. It'd have to be a log scale.

@_date: 2013-12-30 21:47:27
Not in so many words, but yes. I was clarifying that even though I said there would be less debt, I did not say there would be less investment. Investment would shift more to equity. 
Yes, cash would no longer be toxic to hold like it is in inflationary currencies (people don't think about it with the 1-2% inflation dollar, but we certainly think about it here in 30% peso inflationland/argentina). However, it would not necessarily be the best investment. The usual drive to have more will still apply. We're humans after all. *I can sit on x bitcoins and slowly dwindle them away as I spend them, or I can try to invest them and make them grow*. Nothing about deflation changes that, except that I will seek to invest in ventures that will return more than the rate of deflation.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:54:15
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:45:14
yes, "decreasingly inflationary" is indeed called "disinflationary." You and are also talking past each other because you come from the school of thought that says "inflation is increasing the money supply" and his is that "inflation is an increase in the general price level". Thus even though the money supply is currently inflating, because of the exponential adoption rate being experienced right now the general price level is falling (at about 1000 to 5000% per year). So no wonder you two don't meet eye to eye!

Hey Chime, did your 4btc (not just the last 2) get delivered yet? My uncle had this same problem that you had (and hundreds of others have had) and he gave way less info and they reversed the algo.

@_date: 2013-12-30 19:56:10
Okay these are totally new arguments, not truly related to the the OP (and certainly not to my comment above), but let's talk about them!
Pegging the value of BTC to the dollar would require centralization, so no that can't/won't happen. But someone very well could make a new cryptocurrency with a centralized implicit backing that a certain entity (bank or central bank) will give exchange one unit of the currency for one dollar. That absolutely could happen and probably will. 
Your idea to make it "truly P2P" is interesting. I've never heard anyone say that specifically. It does remind me of a thought I've had bouncing in my head lately which is whether we could find a way to break the ability to form mining pools, thus taking a few steps back from the brink of one pool controlling 51%. Btw, miners can invest in all that equipment if they like, but if the users, those who actually send payments, fork the blockchain to a version that renders those miners useless, they'll be forced to change. 
I don't think the "speculative idiocy" has to do much with mining anymore. It's about the potential of the network, and the value of those 2.1 quadrillion units (satoshis) of "currency" that you use to participate in the payment network. The exponential growth I don't think reflects that the network is 5000% more useful than before, but rather that perhaps when it reaches full adoption (which may not and is probably not SUPER WORLD CURRENCY, but somewhere below that), it's value will be much higher than it is now. So last year a satoshi was worth 0.0000001 dollars and now it's worth 0.0000075 dollars. Speculators are betting it might be worth 0.001 (for example). Who cares? They take on the risk (which is they lose everything), they reap the rewards.

@_date: 2013-12-30 05:58:03

I was just sharing a funny joke, I didn't expect this much exposure! In fact, I believe when it came up in conversation the context was that it was a ridiculous notion, not a serious prediction or something I actually wish for! Though I don't blame your response and probably would have had a similar response had I read someone else saying this and thinking they were serious.

@_date: 2013-12-17 19:33:16
Thanks for taking the time to do this. No worries, I do not take whatever you write as advice and don't hold you to any of it. 
Here's my question, as the end of the year approaches I was thinking of putting together all my transactions from throughout the year in one spreadsheet and trying (and probably failing) to label each one correctly as a purchase, sale, transfer, retail purchase with btc, etc. To clarify, I made a lot of purchases and sales as I would buy from exchanges and sell to friends or on localbitcoins. I also bought items online for bitcoins and settled fiat debts in bitcoin (for example, I'd go out to dinner with a friend, he'd pay, and I'd send bitcoins for my half, and vice versa.) 
I want to calculate my total capital gains and then submit that with payment for my taxes. 
* First, can I choose FIFO or LIFO freely? 
* If I can choose, am I correct in preferring LIFO since (1) capital gains drop to 15% after a year so I'm better pushing off the sale (and subsequent capital gain tax) of those lowest purchase-price btc as far forward as I can, and (2) I assume there is a significant chance of BTC going to zero, so I'd rather not pay capital gains upfront, but rather push it forward as far as possible. Is my thinking correct there? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:33:11
When I discuss Bitcoin with skeptics, I have no problem in swatting away arguments that hold no water. But at the same time I, and the whole community, completely openly discuss its problems. The good thing about it is that Bitcoin operates by consensus, so it can be changed, but everyone must agree. Now, within that context there are serious threats to Bitcoin. 
One is this, the centralization of mining power. Absolutely. It has been discussed for years and there are many proposals, some coming from the altcoin community (like Proof-of-Stake, which I suspect you'd really like). Centralization is not inevitable. Even if one mining pool took control, we could fork the chain with a change that renders their power useless and continue down a new chain. They'd be able to mine their chain all they want, but if no one used it because no one trusted it, it'd be as good as dead. The problem can be avoided earlier though, before such drastic measures. 
Another mayor looming problem is the threat of Coinvalidation.com and their attack on the fungibility of bitcoin. 
Those are the two that worry me the most. But the point I'd like to make is that the protocol is not set in stone, and these problems aren't swept under the rug, they are discussed (insanely) openly with the hopes of finding a solution.

1 through 8 are dead-on, but this 9th point is key. I always tell my friends to use lastpass (or something like it) with all different randomly generated passwords (20-30 characters, letters, numbers and symbols) and 2fa on everything. They always ask, "isn't it overkill? I've never been hacked before." And I respond, "you've never had anything worth hacking you for; with bitcoin, now you do and always will."

I thought about that, but I thought the long address would be more impactful than just saying "bitcoin" and more instantly recognizable then a new protocol. Also, I'm not entirely clear how the new protocol will actually work. I need to read up on it.

That is the flipside of having a strong ideological opponent in an argument: if they flip, it gives much more heft to your side. However, you can't count on that.

I recognize I shouldn't have used the word "troll" in the title, it was uncalled for. But I also want to point out I wrote Krugman - *slash* - trolls: slash meaning "hey krugman *and* trolls that roam this subreddit". Not "Hey krugman trolls". 
I mentioned trolls because I'd just seen the same post over and over and over: "bitcoin bad because deflation qed" and I was growing tired of there never being any clear thought behind that meme. I ever reached out to a prolific critic here on and after respectfully trying to engage in conversation and trying to elicit some sort of intellectual foundation for the deflation-will-kill-bitcoin argument, he simply responded "Bitcoin has already failed". Wow, profound. Anyway, that's not you, so now I'll read your post and respond! :)
