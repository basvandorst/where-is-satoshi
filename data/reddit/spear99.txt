Anything below 5800 could very well kill bitcoin. Mining a block right now costs about 5500$ in North America. As soon as bitcoin drops below that threshold, no one in North America will be mining because they will not be able to make money off of it at all. The system would slow down extremely and I highly doubt that the loss of an entire continent of miners would be sustainable. 
Buying at 3500 wouldn’t so much be catching a falling knife, but catching a falling chainsaw covered in nitroglycerin.

You do you, just don’t invest anything that you’re not ok with losing. I’ve got some money invested across various coins and I won’t really be hurting if it all disappears tomorrow.

If you want real amusement, just go through his comment history and watch him be chronically wrong literally every day.

I perhaps didn’t communicate effectively but that’s more or less what I was saying. I’m not suggesting they would be able to predict every rise and drop.

I think he meant that it can’t go down past 5k without severe consequences, not that it isn’t possible for it to go down past 5k. It can crash to 0 tomorrow for all we know, but that’s not really the root of his question.  
A dip below 5k for any sustained amount of time would probably paralyze a large part of the network because without miners the whole exchange would freeze, and current mining costs in North America are around 5-5.5k. We wouldn’t lose all miners because miners in subsidized cost areas like Latin America (Venezuela comes to mind)  could still mine for profit, but the system would certainly slow drastically, and that’s without getting into the impact it would have on speculative trading.

I’m sure it’s possible to predict these things with an advanced degree in mathematics, a decent model that accounts for speculative trading and a decent enough amount of time to train the model, but for the average (or even above average or even exceptional) dweeb on Reddit like you or I, it really is pretty much a crapshoot and you’re entirely right.

I can’t give advice on when to purchase because unlike some people here I’m not going to pretend to predict what bitcoin is going to do. It could go up, or it could tank all the way to 0. 
All I’d say is don’t invest anything you aren’t willing to lose.

You certainly would need a team but I think using historical data from crypto itself, plus historical data from the stock exchange before protections really were put in place would shorten the amount of time needed to generate a model. I wouldn’t be surprised if such a model were invented within 4-6 years (assuming crypto sticks around that long)

Im a happy camper doing both. Stocks are my safe future. Crypto is playing money.
