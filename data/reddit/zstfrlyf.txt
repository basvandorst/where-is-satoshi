"Creating a descriptive, keyword-rich title tag is important for increasing rankings in search engines. The screenshot below comes from  Moz's survey of 37 influential thought leaders in the SEO industry on search engine ranking factors. In that survey, 35 of the 37 participants said that keyword usage in the title tag was the most important place to use keywords to achieve high rankings."
    Be Mindful of Length
    A maximum amount of 70 characters will display in the search results. The engines will show an ellipsis, "..." to indicate that a title tag has been cut off.
    Place Important Keywords Close to the Front of the Title Tag
    According to Moz's testing and experience, the closer to the start of the title tag a keyword is, the more helpful it will be for ranking—and the more likely a user will be to click them in search results."
In your case your URL is not important to the focus of your mission. The limited space 70 characters should be used wisely. Do key word/phrase research. Hope this helps...
