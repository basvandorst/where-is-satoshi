It will be very interesting to see the developments in the next 10 years, as we reach the limits of classical physics.

The thing is that there is absolutely no reason why such overly large blocks would propagate.
There would have to be new safeguards in the software, but my reasoning is as follows:
Huge blocks take longer to propagate. During the time a large block takes to propagate, a new block would arrive. When another block arrived on top of the previous one, the longest chain would prevail and the big block would be discarded. 
Something like this would be much easier to implement (and IMO, better for Bitcoin) than keeping the keeping the *block size* at some constant value, or at a value that increases according to some arbitrary function.
This method scales with the technology, whatever may happen in the future. Download speeds get 100x faster? Fine, the miners will adjust to that. Download speeds are the same? No harm done, miners have their limits in place.
I know I'm sounding like a cocky asshole, but I honestly fail to understand why there must be a limit. 


I do agree with you on this. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:57:36
Looks solid! 
I have couple of questions about the interface, maybe someone can answer them:
1) Why does it have to ask the range of the amount before asking for the amount itself? Smell like a legal restriction to me, but can anyone clarify?
2) Why does it ask for a phone number? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:30:53
oh shit. well spotted.
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:08:59
Volatility is the real issue for them. Bitcoin could be worth 100$ by tomorrow. Or 1000$. But chances are they're not willing to take the risk. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:11:40
That's sums up my thoughts on this issue. Gavin stated some time ago that he believes removing the block size limits completely would not cause damage to the network. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:34:24
That's my guess too.
I'm sure OP did not intend to, but he's using circular logic. It's important to notice that the blocks were mostly mined by known pools and those pools did not see a notorious increase in their hashrate.

I always wonder why sometimes french news pop up around here. This is an international sub so the language used is english.

Agreed. 


~~I am curious, is there something else out there that may be the solution to making transistors smaller other than Quantum Computing?~~
EDIT: Brainfart removed
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:20:34


Yes, I mean SHA256 ASICs. My bad, I thought that 16nm was the current limit. I was wrong. 7nm would be amazing. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:42:32
Side note: Srsly, take her name out of there.
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:05:07
Is it still happening? I mean, [the time between the last 10 blocks seems a **little** strange](
Block 390472 to 390474 were mined in a 2 minute interval. Not even 2 minutes between each. All within a freaking 2 minute interval.
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:37:49
Great idea! 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:39:39
I use paper wallets that are generated offline in a machine that's never been connected to the internet. Secure enough for the small amounts i'm holding. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:02:35
The awesome thing about this is that after 16nm technology, the only way to keep up with moore's law is through quantum computing. 
I am expecting a revolution in that field, motivated by (not only, but also) bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:20:37
Must be easy to compute.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:54:16


This would be a dream come true for me. I think this is exactly what Bitcoin needs.
Can anyone tell me a reason why this would be a bad idea?
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:45:36
But why would miners move closer to each other? What really takes time is transmission, not propagation, right? 
Propagation of a bit around the earth takes ~0.2s. Transmission seems to be a whole different order of magnitude. 
What makes you think propagation times would be significant enough to make miners move closer together? 
[relevant link (read the network diameter part)](
Huge blocks, if anything, make the physical location of miners more irrelevant.
Disclaimer: I'm a newb and I may be completely wrong. Do correct me if i'm wrong please. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:03:09
I did. 
The answer is `x = inverse_sha256(y)`.
Now I just need to find  `inverse_sha256`, but that must be easy right?
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:21:27
I do think for myself. I did not lose faith in Bitcoin, but I think his reasons for doing so are pretty legit. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:28:34


Or a decrease in selling! 
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:51:03
Question here. Is it safe to assume that when/if "bigger than 1MB" versions represent more than half of the network, the network will fork when the first &gt;1MB block is found? 
EDIT: Great, downvotes for a legit question...
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:30:08
I think it's mainly due to Cryptsy. Mike's blog post didn't help, but i don't think it's very relevant to the price. I wish him all the best though. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:12:17
no prob ;)
let me know if the questions persist after reading the post, i may be able to help.

There can be a whole lot of controversy. You cannot run it over Tor, but you can use VPNs to mask your IP.
Another thing that may be controversial is the sale of items that are legal in one place and illegal in another. Bibles are banned in some places, but nothing forbids me to sell a Bible in OB to whoever buys it.

He's actually right. All of the wallets have it planned, but not ready. Just read the link.

Mike Hearn, one of the most notorious members of the community has lost faith in Bitcoin and sold everything. 
His reasons are pretty legit, IMO.
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:51:22
No, they don't.
They won't even allow me to sell Bitcoin on their platform.

So are the anti-viruses he created. That didn't stop millions of people from using them.

What are "invisible nodes"?

I think the most powerful promotion of OpenBazaar will be through the Streisand Effect. Once some controversy emerges, the govs will try to shut it down and thousands of news articles will be published about it. 
Honestly, I can't wait.

It's sad so many people are downvoting. Greedy bastards. 
Thank you Bitcoinic for doing this! ;)

They use the one I used in the title. Bitcoin has an extra vertical bar. (I used ฿ in the title because it was easier. I can't paste the Bitcoin symbol.)

He didn't try to take anyone with him. He stated his reasons and let everyone make his own judgement.

Well... if that's not profitable mining, I don't know what is...! 


I am amazed.

HODLing and LEANRing are my two favourite things about Bitcoin.

I'd say using it would be pretty good. Also, use software that uses Bitcoin, such as OpenBazaar and stuff.
