Gets funnier

It... trickles down?
Ah, now i understand the right.

People usually get rich to flaunt thier wealth. The less reliable that gets as as a way to make friends, the less flashy they'll be - and that takes care of much of the excess by itself.
And similarly, the rest is not rocket science. Do you need a palace? 1 palace in * currency * is probably a good start for too much money. Nobody said it had to be precise, you just need common sense to solve basically all the problems. The rich are, after all, *that* much richer then the rest of us.

Uh... trillion?

So the new system also has rich fucks. It also doesn't have inflation and is more secure, which is what people will get in for.

Sounds very promising but is it actually bulletproof? Read any counterarguments?

The short term gains are in altcoins, and the long term ramp is clearly too unpredictable to not invest.

*Looks at Bernie*

Would it actually take longer then 2 days max? But yes... there would just be time. 1mil - 1.5 mil -1 Bil - 10 bil. That could work.

People are more connected and interdependent then ever before. Ideals are necessary.
@_date: 2019-11-04 17:11:00
But then we'll have used ultra instinct before even 1 mil! You know what though... i'll give you it, so long as we keep SS3 for 1 mill. Even further beyond is... perfect. 
Spirit Bomb is obviously reserved for Market Cap and the death of ~~Frieza~~ the current financial system.

I think the difference is between being well-off and being rich. Having enough not to worry? That's fine. Having way more then you need when others are needy? That's a problem.

The tumbler services for Bitcoin aren't commonly used enough for it to be truly anonymous anymore (and i'm uncertain whether they're airtight or not), so i don't think the safe funds argument holds water. Getting around capital controls is going to stick though.

I wish the answer was this entertaining. The right are usually the ones who strongly dislike bernie, that's all, yo.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:16:33
The actual studies say different. People make up so many false leads it's not even worth the resources, and you *do* get people that never crack.

More of a mouthful but A\* advertising.

I was with you until you got petty, he's just trying to be funny. (And he is, in both senses).
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:33:33
Oh come on man.

You're a 4 ~~week~~ month old redditor. Pull the other one it's got bells on.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:01:56


In *this* context.

So we've gone full cyberpunk.
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:56:12
How much? That still sounds clunky, and please explain what a SAT is.

Have a funny [video]( i hope your day improves.

If it was that simple, he would never have ordered hits. Even if you think silk road reduced violent drug crime, he didn't need to kill to keep it up. He'd provided the proof of concept, those hits could be nothing but greed and fear.

Judging by [this]( DPR was the first to escalate to violence.
