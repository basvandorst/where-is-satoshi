The campus bar sells Keith's for $5/bottle. This isn't a school in a place where beer is hard to come by, either.

That's what they said in a month. These causality-violating delays will be the death of me.

I never got that. In Canada, minimum wage is $9.60 for minors, and $10.25 for everyone else, regardless of whether or not your line of work includes tips (I can say this with confidence, having worked at a restaurant where tips were accepted, during high school).

Nice try, BFL PR.

I do wish I could have your restraint.

I was using "investing" in a broader sense of the term. I saw the front page post that Bitcoin isn't a stock, a company, or a product. I'm thinking of putting money into it in the hopes of getting some kind of advantage (not necessarily monetary).

One of the "I"s in his username is a vertical bar ("|").

Wow. That pretty much covers everything I wanted to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:15:17
I laughed *way* too hard at that.

Very thorough answer, thank you!
A couple of follow-ups, though:


Wouldn't this be a pretty huge flaw? Say that someone with money to burn – a billionaire – in the future, after all Bitcoins are mined, purchases a significant amount of the Bitcoin economy, say 1% of all Bitcoins ever mined, anonymously, and stores them on a cryptographically perfect server (I know that's virtually impossible, but again, this is hypothetical). 
Immediately after the purchase, without telling anyone, that billionaire dies.
Is that 1% of all Bitcoins permanently removed from the economy? Considering the nature of the economy, is that harmful? If not, what if it were more than 1%?


Just to get a sense of scale, how many hashes, on average, must be broken to get 1 BTC?  Is that number variable based on the value of a Bitcoin, or does the difficulty of the hashes keep the number constant?
Finally, 


Assuming no Bitcoins are lost, Bitcoin becomes a universal currency, and the human population stabilizes at 9 billion, this means that each person will have, on average, 0.002333... BTC to themselves. Considering the change of value Bitcoin could undergo during this period, would 0.0023... BTC be a satisfactory amount of money to have in the bank? Could one feed their family using millionths of a Bitcoin over a short period of time? (On the bright side, kids in the future should have no problem with fractions).

Guys, you're using all the puns. Things might get *hairy* soon.

I beg to differ. I used a country known for shady financial goings-on, leaving the floor open to a new kind of jokes. Feel free to pick an even more economically shifty land. Nigeria, for example.

Boy, that escalated quickly. Not sure I follow you, actually.

I see you've played knifey-spooney before.

I don't have any BTC to get scammed out of (yet), but it's on top of my wish list when I invest next month.

[Hate to break it to you, but...](
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:43:04
These kinds of bubbles have popped before; I managed to narrowly avoid the last one because, despite the overwhelming excitement, one Redditor reminded me that BTC shouldn't be thought of as a stock.
Ultimately, it's this kind of excitement that causes this sudden inflation, and the inevitable collapse immediately thereafter.

It's a bit fucked up that a six month shipping delay is cause for a smiley.

Most atheists that I know (including myself) of would never do that. It breaks the golden rule.

You'd think that at least the production of the actual cases and some more common components is outsourced to a mass production facility.

Bitch, please. sketchybitcoinexchange.ru has 100,000,000,000 (more than there are in circulation) for 0.11 RUB.

[Wikipedia has a thorough entry on the topic](
Basically, it's "treat others as you would like to be treated yourself." As explained on that Wiki page, its origin can be traced back to the Torah, but is believed to be a basic rule of ethics in many ancient societies. The rule has since been adopted by many religions, from Confucianism to Judaism to Christianity.
Incidentally, there are also LaVeyan Satanism's Eleven Rules of the Earth (sort of like the 10 Commandments, but they acknowledge that humans are imperfect). The eleventh rule is an interesting twist on the golden rule:


(Personally, I like the wording.)
