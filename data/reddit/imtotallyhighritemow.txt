Different response from the pizza delivery girl.  When asked if she wanted a handful of foreign currency possibly totaling $100 vs the $5usd tip, she took the foreign currency.  She wins, I'm lazy.

So if you are describing monetary policy, it seems you are saying btc only wins when monetary time preference teeters between save or spend.  Do you think this needs to be created artificially via a board of governors or via market mechanisms?  How does such equilibrium come about while most people holding the asset are not transacting with it?

would you call that a fork?

This is how stupidly the last generation handled retirement, they never bothered to ask if this was really how wealth and value was created and stored.  Hint, it wasn't.  Better start demanding it works right now rather than wishing it did later.

I was trying to show how china pumped big before they got out, then of course futures market entered the game which meant much of the 'fake volume' which was probably related to usdt and just overall bullshittery(see hitbtc, binance, fake volume google) which people see disappearing from the market.. i.e. easy money is no longer on the table for stupid bot trading so they are bleeding themselves out slowly now.  Then layer on that.. no pun intended layers, explain them poorly to a boomer and they just say nah i'll let that shit sort itself out.  This is a plebians explanation, I am pretty dull when it comes to this stuff.

Wait 3 dudes can crash bitcoin.... sounds like a great investment to get in on.  nope.  Why maintain this myth, why maintain the myth that 3 guys can remove 50bil from a market in 3 months and it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of that coin or the goals and path of its management.  This is complete and utter bullshit, the coin is crashing because fundamentals, not good to hold, not great to transact with.  They can either fix those or fuck off, but the shit the op lists is a fantasy.   China and Asia for the most part left, and the pyramids base couldn't grow, and since transactional use value was also tanked simultaneously... now were here.  Pretending its mythical, or conspiratorial, or related to ver or jihan is fantasy for npc's to continue to the hype train.

stop spamming bullshit fluff, you are not helping by flooding bitcoin with fluff type analysis.... most people can smell fomo fluff from miles away and its beginning to look like all this forum is any good for, and what message does that send...

 i'm just now seeing investment buddies starting to chat publicly about btc, not noobs or rubes but srs people who just have limited time to give a shit so they don't until they have to... people seem to negate the 'threshold' of ideas in highly competitive landscapes, lots of people avert their eyes, especially when the threat seems almost existential and maybe comical compared to the market caps they are used to.

"Bitcoin has a lot of con artists, a lot of people wrongly selling it as a speculative trading vehicle."
It has to be everything it is, but it doesn't have to always be that.  Is there a place for speculators to solidify the next use case?  I believe we need to be able to answer why the speculators are here, how BTC can use them, and who comes next rather than hoping to shape the nature of people.  You start selling shit and people will speculate on its future prices lol.
I think about this like a startup, a lot of the earliest investors are likely the ones who want out first.  First in, first out, is a common phrase.  Yet like a business when the first out peace out, nothing inherently bad happens unless the value of the business is less than the initial investors(obviously this is often uber complicated).  Is speculating in BTC like early round funding?  Is that a bad thing?  
I'm not a speculator in anything but technological revolution, but I mean when you grow up on SnowCrash your bound to see things a bit different.  I don't expect my friends who spent their lives trading markets to flip the technorevolution switch anytime soon, but they might help secure the system we in the future use to flip that switch.  I mean imagine having existing traders pay for the system that replaces them by playing on their nature and desire to speculate... as use value increases speculators leave for volatility, we stay for change?  
Sorry this is barely coherent lol

nice ya lets see how it goes! I come from a failed kickstarter background where a technology went through the cracks when a business failed(hard tech, tangible tech, not code, durable goods).  I really wish my next business could have a decentralized twist, maybe even funding and partial product management via a blockchain.  I could imagine targeting nuanced and niche markets by allowing individuals to actually own and direct the nature of a business(means of production) through the chain.  Unfortunately the legal framework for making this happen is at best hazy, but I look forward to being the first to try it, even have the product lined up to execute.  shit i'm on my inebriated account can't share more, or else the account paths will cross, we will meet again...   good chat!

do you not have 50 normies asking you for authority figures they recognize to say the things you keep saying but they don't get?  Seriously diversity in explanation and expression of ideas ads to the zeitgeist.

Somehow you managed to navigate my poorly parsed ideas; congrats you may not be a lawyer after all.  I appreciate you finally explaining your core beliefs on this case.  Those beliefs require an extraordinary amount of trust, faith and confidence in prosecutors intent.  Maybe that is founded in personal knowledge, or just a better ability to sniff the truth, but it sounds a lot like guessing.  Why guess with such moral certainty?  Is there any possibility that this may not be efficacious in creating the change you hope for... less kid pervs and less access to kids by the pervs?
I imagine you could reference your vast wealth of legal precedent and dig up a few times where prosecutorial overreach caused more harm to people despite their stated intentions overwise?  Maybe even a few cases where kids were harmed because of it?  Does that matter to your understanding of the language prosecutors use to characterize the actions of the defendant?
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:49:04
your in btc, you make claims in a court case to the specificity of actions of a client whose actions are only abstractly and in brief made public.  
So you either are aware of the process used on the site which is somehow transparent to other observers just browsing, or your implying a process or service everyone else is unaware of but somehow uses.  We see backpage as craigslist which is unedited or uncropped for content... You see a rape buffet.   
Either you assume everything listed is non consensual rape buffets for cash, and you think some percentage of those are children, but can you really extrapolate that how you do without inventing things out of whole cloth?  If so how?  What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:23:41




When the law doesn't reach outside their moral purview they do the reaching themselves at their own risk and unfortunately those on the fringe are less likely to fight back... too bad Thiel can't fund this guys fight, maybe pound some civil suits in enough TX districts to hurt them where they hate it, in the pocket book.  
@_date: 2016-10-07 17:07:21




You are certain about the claims of others.  You later admit its a bit more guesswork.  You can focus on the poor choice of words and the grammatical incoherence of my statements but you continue to respond to them with full understanding of the ideas conveyed.  You are a lawyer after all, just a lil cheaper than I expected.    
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:01:24
I would replace 'in time' and use 'with use' but I could be wrong too. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:44:24
I'm sure when we are all reading the content of the claims rather than reading into the veracity of the prosecutor you will find our moral condemnation more fitting your current self righteous certainty.  I tried to make this as annoying to read as possible.
