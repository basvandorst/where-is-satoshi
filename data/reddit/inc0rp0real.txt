I do like iota and it's opportunities to work with renewable energy. I like their founder as well, he's very smart and inspirational with a good upbringing, although I suggest you watch the top video on this Bitcoin forum that is pinned "The Bitcoin Standard" to help determine if you truly think it's a bad thing for a cryptocurrency to be difficult to be created. It's an interesting perspective he puts out there.

I see. I'm just inspired and want to see people like us who may have always wanted a different world go ahead and make it happen. My parents always said, "Nerds rule." As you get older, you realize how true that really is.

I guess I'll have to keep reading the Lightning Network white paper to find out if it's as easy as sending an email. Even if it is that simple it's not going to stop me from diving into this. I want to be an expert and help establish Bitcoin as a better way to pay. I suggest you do the same. I predict a point at around 2024 where it is much more feasible to be payed in Bitcoin than invest fiat into it.

Thanks for showing me OpenDime. Looks like it has already been developed.

I think a manga about Satoshi Nakamoto would be great. You could go any direction you want.

Read this article from the Scientific American about how solar cell productivity could be applied to Moore's Law 
Are computers and solar destined to be intertwined in harmony? I certainly hope so.

I am not a bot. I'm just like you.

Thank you. I was confused about lightning network but now I really think that is the way to go.

Do not fret. This is a common feeling on your journey to Bitcoin enlightenment. Move beyond the past and it's archaic banking infrastructure. Do not judge your past but accept it. No longer shall you see $7538.45 but 1. Then you may invest in peace.

Good points. What if we could find a way to store bitcoin physically? What if two parties could transact offline and the block be added once connected online to the party's convenience? Even if one party connected online it would document the other party's gain or loss.

I like telling stories and thinking off the top of my head. I appreciate your concern and compliments in all reality. I hope you did think it was insightful. I'm not too worried, the internet will hit the physical reality soon anyways.

I will do it. Taking advantage of the discontent.
