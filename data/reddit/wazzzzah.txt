He's saying that Facebook and Bitcoin are similar, though. You just explained why they are actually fundamentally different, no?

What exactly makes you say "approximately" instead of "at least"?

Well, you CAN do it--this way:

This list from October 2013 has him at # 22. Is there a more recent list, or a regularly updated one?

Damn man, you shoulda read faster

To me, all commercials do that. But broadcasts, whether on radio or TV, need to be paid for, and not every company wants to go the Wikipedia route of simply begging:

Not really... The gold backing was one major fundamental difference, and they went through quite a wringer due to that model, which is very different from that of Bitcoin:
Friedman is talking about something that can't be tracked in such a way. The following debate covers that in much more depth--these guys spend a lot of time arguing about previous gold-backed digital currencies, but the Bitcoin guy provides the actual history and the problems inherent in such a system:

He insists on thinking the way he's always thought about it. And that's even despite my having just sent him these charts:
He was also declaring the "end" of gold's climb in the value, citing its recent performance... But look past the 30 days chart and even the 2-chart, and then start with the 5-year chart and all those that follow. That's a hell of a safer long-term investment than stocks:
Maybe it's just that the 24/7 cycle of news/hype/hysteria/scandal/ridicule and the attention theft (cool new phrase:  ) of smartphone usage and all the incoming interruptions have so fried the brains of so many people that they can only see and understand whatever is happening right now, at this moment...at this nanosecond...at this iSecond.

That's right. I think that just about anyone would view something that threatens their livelihood, reputation, and source of income as "evil."

There are several very good comments under that article -- I'll paste one of them here, from a reader named Chicago Bob:

That is awesomely insightful... See the some parallel drawn here, in this elaboration (of mine) on a point about decentralized digital infrastructures, based on what was recently explained by a Bitcoin entrepreneur:

That interpretation is totally spot-on. A+

Wow, nice find!!!!!!

Lol... exactly. And to get a bit more literal with the magical and fantastical nature of it, a currency for the Minecraft video game, Craftcoins, are ranked on CoinMarketCap amongst all those others. Opponents of Bitcoin are perhaps not even aware of the forms of digitized monetary value units that are very much validated on particular Internet realms that have millions of daily users: there's **Facebook Credits** (also available in physical card form at 7-11 convenience stores across America), there's **Reddit Gold**, and there's **World of Warcraft Points** (

And he is so off-base in his attempt to identify the politics of Bitcoin users:


He somehow tries to represent libertarians as being always (or at least usually) being right-wing. Apparently he's not aware of *liberal* libertarians, which certainly seems to be the predominant political stance across Reddit. Liberals and libertarians agree on many issues: to name three such issues, they are both against the needless military interventionism; and they are both against the criminalization of recreational drug use; and they both for the privacy of the citizenry! But anyway, he practically reveals his lack of knowledge by qualifying with a shrug, "I think it’s safe to say...," which is typically precedes a fresh assumption about something, rather than a genuine fact-based conclusion.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:54:00
I don't think he meant *experiment* in that basic scientific sense of a straightforward controlled test or trial-run of some theory, but rather in the sense of a new system that is underway with being used, and that is still in a very fresh, new state--like, that Bitcoin exists in (or *as*) an economic and monetary frontier that people are creating and defining proactively, and in a wide variety of ways, not merely something that they are just testing out for as long as it lasts. I mean, look at how much it has developed, evolved, expanded, and been used and diversified SO FAR! 
It's much like how people can say the Internet is still very much "an experiment," or that democracy or communism is an experiment. There's even a famous quote attributed to Sigmund Freud, that "America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success." I don't think he means it in the sense of one big nationwide experiment of a hypothesis, but a long ongoing process and mixture of activities and businesses and culture and customs, which is what I view Bitcoin as! And I don't think it will fail.

Thank you for adding that claus to his analysis.

And some new paper money even sticks to itself:

It ain't fine with HIM, as full-time mouthpiece for the establishment, even though the NYTimes has a reputation among some people as a paper that is SooOoOo liberal and so critical of the powers that be (I'm referring to Fox News' depiction of the paper).
