You could say the same about that logo of a fruit with a bite mark that is supposed to stand for one of the largest consumer electronics companies. Or that logo of a checkmark representing a sport clothing company. A logo being memorable is more important than the logo representing the type of product that company sells.

I love it. It's perfect.

Yes, sounds great.

Why did they change it from 8000 to 9000 in the translation? I feel betrayed.

I'd say it depends how much you invested and how risk adverse you are. For a thousand dollars worth of coins, it's not worth getting a hardware wallet in my opinion. 5000? Maybe yeah. 10000$ or more? Definitely get a Ledger or Trezor.
Phones can get stolen, computers can break. So if you have a software wallet, make sure you have a backup somewhere or keep your private keys in a safe spot.

Bitcoin is at all time high but many alts are fairly cheap at the moment due to the Bitcoin bull run. Even though I believe in Bitcoin long term, there will be a pullback some time happening (soon?).
If I had any more fiat to invest, I would buy alts for cheap now. I expect that after the fork this month, the run for Bitcoin will slow down and alts will catch up. Therefore for the coming few months, I see a better potential for growth in alt coins than Bitcoin. And if you rather believe in Bitcoin long term, you can wait a few months for the alts to boom and the inevitable pullback of Bitcoin and then convert your alts to BTC. 
Just my 2 cents....

Ah okay, that makes sense. Anyway, I never watched that series, just know the meme.

question: the linked Wired article claims the following: "And if the government of China or the US decide bitcoin is a threat to civil society with its electricity usage, it’s not going to survive,” Bonneau says. “You can run an underground cryptocurrency, but not one that burns a gigawatt of electricity. Producing a gigawatt cannot be done in secret.”
Isn't that false? from my understanding with fewer miners the difficulty would simply drop and the bitcoin network would carry on processing transactions

I use the [Blockfolio]( app on my phone to keep track of my portfolio. There you can set an alarm for each currency to notify you if the price drops below a certain mark.

some really great work there!

Despite the silly screenshot, the TV clip is actually quite descent: 
What they say is that in times of crises (current example: North Korea), people tend to invest their money in other ways, for example Bitcoin (or gold, but that's more complicated to buy). They don't say anything about North Korea being involved with Bitcoin.

You sell your Bitcoin to buy children's toys?

The only item I bought from my Bitcoins was the Ledger Nano S. It seemed fitting to pay in BTC.

Well, that's what they said in 2011:
and 2013:
...and many other times. Maybe one day the party will be over. But right now, I see no reason why that should happen any time soon. Bitcoin will survive the Segwit2X drama. Even the China ban didn't do any significant damage. More and more people get to know about Bitcoin and get excited about cryptocurrencies. There's a limited supply. Right now, things seem to look pretty bright.
