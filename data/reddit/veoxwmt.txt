The servers' `gateway` component can federate (same code as OpenBazaar), although it hasn't been tested properly yet - that would require more servers, with proper encryption between them.
Also, the `gateway` is only a mediator between mixing parties - it passes pseudonymous messages, same as the chat functionality (trollbox), except the channel is not displayed (EDIT: by default).

There is no way to fingerprint a block creator.
* Generation / coinbase is different every time.
* The origin IP can be changed easily.
* Time skew is highly unreliable.
If either of these is not true, then it's a bug with the pool software.

Share variance can be helped by having several p2pool chains. This is done on Vertcoin, although a tad hackishly, by manually specifying the the p2pool chain to mine on. It's all a bandaid where ~~sidechains~~ treechains are unavailable.

It's been around [for quite a while]( and is reasonably mature. It sports much better documentation (as in specification) than Stratum. Almost nobody is using it, because Stratum got support of the biggest miner back when it came out, while GBT didn't.

Darkwallet is a Chrome (or Chromium) extension. There is no need for a binary.
A Firefox extension is also planned, but it will be ported only when the first one is ready for Beta.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:31:46
The backend server OB uses (Obelisk ATM) doen't have this feature. However, the Darkwallet `gateway` does (also uses Obelisk as a backend).
The reason this feature is not ported upstream (from Darkwallet to an Obelisk plugin, so OB could use it, too) is because Obelisk is undergoing a major refactoring.

Yup. "Freedom of the protocol" and network integration has little to do with how this particular piece of software is licensed. There is no need for a "license to communicate" at this level of network abstraction. What it does (and AGPL doesn't) is allows running separate networks, where users don't get the same rights.
What we can* do now is create an eBay-style service running nodes for other people, taking fees, providing notary/arbitration services, and snooping on them in the meanwhile, all legally.
Or, perhaps, something less sinister. We can* now build a "derivative" for Windows with a trojan, and distribute it without the source. Seeing how there is no Windows build yet, such work could constitute considerable improvement, which we could rebrand and relicense. I'm sure people would use it. Next step: same for Android.
Freedom is great when everyone has it. But freedom is even better when you can have slaves.
*: As soon as _everyone_ who wrote a line in DarkMarket signs a formal document to relicense the software (on which OpenBazaar is based).

Blockchain does not necessarily mean Bitcoin. Namecoin comes to mind immediately (see [comment]( by It's true that implementing these "novel uses" is not as straightforward as it could be, which is why Ethereum's turing-complete language is an interesting experiment.

Pretty much agreed on what you've said, especially the wealth distribution part.
The tiniest of my disagreements is on "Access to altCoins". Big exchanges adding altcoins can be compared to protocol changes on the Bitcoin network: they're hard to do and instantly affect a lot of users. System-wide risk is high.
It is more probable that smaller exchanges add alts and thus acquire a larger market share (continuing the analogy, it's similar to altcoins adding features and thus gaining relevance).
For example, I'm using [Kraken]( among others, and it already has Litecoin and Namecoin. [Cryptsy]( has announced plans to add fiat currencies, too. The list goes on.
What I would really like to see addressed is this misconception by the OP, though:


No, it's not. Here's a real-world example.
Quite recently, someone wanted to send me the equivalent of 2.9 EUR using cryptocurrency. At 640 EUR/XBT, it's 0.00453125 XBT, so the minimum fee of 0.0001 would amount to a whopping **2.2%**. At 14.5 EUR/LTC, that would be 0.2 LTC, and a minimum fee of 0.001 amounts to **0.5%**.
So if this wasn't a one-off exchange; if, for example, I was a merchant selling small cheap items, I would have an incentive to accept Litecoin, simply because the fees would be lower. On a larger scale, that is the economic purpose of altcoins: to offload certain types of transactions to a different blockchain.
The divisibility of Bitcoin is overrated: at a high enough price and adoption percentage, it could only be used for high-value transactions, such as real estate, long-term business contracts and the like.
Also, the carrying capacity of the network is about 4000 transactions per 10 minutes, or 1.(6) tr./s (with a block size of 1 MiB and an average transaction size of 250 bytes). Sure-sure, this can be improved, but not to VISA-scale.
If adoption increases, transactions *will* have to be loaded off to a different network. You don't buy a loaf of bread with a golden coin. Litecoin is silver to Bitcoin's gold. Peercoin and Primecoin (or whatever) are copper. End of story.

Can't seem to find the source code of their software anywhere. Is it available? Can't trust closed-source cryptography.

First off, a separate codebase.
Then, following the UNIX philosophy (sx), a detached protocol library (libbitcoin), backend/frontend separation, built-in trustless mixing, wallets as browser plugins.

An *ASIC* is essentially an FPGA "set in stone", i.e. without reconfigurability. Having 240 *ASICs* that each do 250 MH/s is like having 240 FPGAs, for a total of 60 GH/s.
For a nice breakdown on what's inside an *ASIC hashing unit*, see this [BFL Butterfly teardown video]( It mentions all the basic components inside. You can start your research from here. I'm only mentioning BFL because I haven't seen a proper Avalon ASIC unit teardown yet.

Another way: have multiple disposable accounts.

That seems fairly easy, actually. A smartcard to hold at least one secret key, a balance number, and a few change addresses. If it can sign a conforming transaction in reasonable time (say, a few seconds), receive a PIN and wipe itself after a few unsuccessful PINs, it is as good as a credit card in terms of functionality. The hardware can't even cost as much as a newly-issued VISA.
Wait, did I just describe a hardware wallet?
