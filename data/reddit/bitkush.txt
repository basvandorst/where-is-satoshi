They get you smart enough to do the job but keep you stupid enough to not think for yourself and become something great. The educational system is meant to dumb you down and convince you college debt is the best way for freedom. When everyone knows trades are much more skilled and pay much higher with very little schooling.

My guess is because the wallets are still active. I would assume wallets being inactive for 5+ years with zero movement would be considered not circulating and more or less "lost". Just my guess

When does the payouts happen though? Like when can we expect people to receive and potentially sell their coins

Just moved mine off today. So relieving especially after all that wicked news of accounts locked and exchange hacks

Terrible. Absolutely terrible.

This is going to be hard to tackle because it's so distributed. I feel this solution will come after they make wallets and overall storage much easier though because it kind of goes hand in hand

Look at all the runs and crashes. From memory I was like the first run was -90% the next crash was around -80% and now we are at -70%. I'm buying.

Only if merchants arent converting straight back to fiat like Starbucks is planning. Then your spending your bitcoin to dump the market while also hodling...

You could always sell 25-50% of your stack and tether just incase. That way your not fully fucked if it doesn't go your way

You must've not read my entire comment... 
And how is holding your coins a "surefire" way to not get rekt. If the price plummets you just got wrecked... that's why I suggested only selling a small portion to increase your stack if it does tank. But still have majority if it ends up going up.

You're missing the point. If my 20$ bill rips into 1/5s I can take to a bank and they'll give me a new one and discard the ripped one. The Fed will literally then print one and give it back to the bank. Your money just inflated 
.000000000x% 
You can't do the same for btc with lost password or private keys to your wallet. What are they going to Do? Your shit out of luck if you lose your wallets. Nobody can give you a new one because the banks ass, or whoever gave u a replacement bitcoin, wont be covered like a freshly printed dollar bill. 
I'm not disagreeing the less in circulation the higher the price, that's obvious. Just that what you said didn't relate to the original comment imo

Are you 15? You can print unlimited cash notes. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million

And he would have to fill every order above 3k before he could let it go for 3k

His comment has nothing to do with value. It has to do with asking about how btc will be a world currency if people keep losing their wallet information...

Bitcoin can also be lost and never found again, much easier then losing a bar of gold. Bitcoin also can't be refunded when you send a transaction, unless you trust the consumer to give it back. You also can't call a customer support to cancel your account if you get anything stolen, like your entire wealth written down on paper. Extremely flawed don't fool yourself.

Yup. If they don't encourage new money by pumping it they're just trading with themselves. They pump it like this so you put fresh money in they can take when they dumb. People don't learn. Look at the 4 hour charts and tell me that's organic...

Bitfinex is banned where I live by my government. No joke. I don't know where else to short it.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:26:11
Stupid, uneducated investors.

I think I saw your 50$ pump up the charts
