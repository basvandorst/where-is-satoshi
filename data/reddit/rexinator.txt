Always agree with that advice but any accountant or advisor who does not tell you to invest as much as you can in your 401k, and I am not saying max, is to be treated with suspicion. Especially if there is a any employer match in your plan. They maybe not wrong but you have to think that advice needs another opinion. If they start brining out the whole life policies or mention the word annuity think about running. Depending on your situation a IRA or Roth IRA maybe something to invest in after your 401k.  If they bring those up listen and then decide.

Participation is almost always at the employers discretion. They may have rules that safeguard you from risky investments or they may not. Either way it is up to to select the right investments and weighting. Two pieces of advice for whatever it is worth, think twice before going long on your company with 401k stock purchases. If it is your sole play then fine but think Enron or think Google. Who do you work for? Big names backing funds mean nothing. At least one of the guys advising this fund oversaw, as chairman, a multibillion ( 15? Billion) dollar loss at Barclays and was in charge during the still not done with Libor scandal. Is that the guy you want to invest with? Not saying don't but be smart with your cash. Knowledge is key.

If someone can figure out how to make money on it, it will almost certainly happen and be available as widely as possible. They just got to figure out the hedge.

Not sure what you ask can be done. Investments in 401k plans are usually limited to employer approved funds and therefore  fairly conservative. Hard to qualify a decently invested 401k as horrible. Stock indices are at or near historic highs. The ten year return on the S&amp;P 500 is over 7%. That ain't bad. Invest in bitcoin as you will but be aware of the volatility of your investment.  It is a volatile emerging currency and the risk is substantial. Be prepared to lose. Some risk in a portfolio, depending on you situation, can be advisable. Be that bitcoin, some EM fund, commodities (don't!) or some other play is up to you and your tolerance. That said I wish I had bought more at $22, which I didn't. Remember 401k's are the long play. Use other funds to speculate.
