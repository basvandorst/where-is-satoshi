Exactly. Gains. Bitcoin saw less gains in that timeframe than what you sunk into another coin. You still had $3000 dollars to invest either way. The cost of the coin does not matter.

These are my thoughts. Don't use crypto to get rich in fiat -- use crypto to stabilize your net worth as crypto eats a portion of forex's market cap. By the time it stabilizes use cases will be rampant. We're here to get rich in crypto before it's big, not to get rich in fiat after it's big

Gold has never been more useless than right now. There's a reason that gold, platinum, and silver have had an inverse correlation with the current crypto uptrend. And if you're still not sure why, take a ponder as to why palladium is still headed the only direction it has since the boom of the personal computer and cellular phones 
edit: note I said more useless, not less valuable. Gold had a great year and is above where it was not too much longer before the start of 2017. In fact I believe they're still above their last big downturn before the late summer crypto growth

Still a building full of people who are looking to make a profit, even if they tend to be a bit more ethical about it. You can hide your money in a glass box where everyone can verify it's real but no one can touch it, why put it in a safe in a building with armed guards when the banks could decide at any point that they don't want you to have your money anymore?
It's really an idea that will take people and society some time to get used to -- and it will be fought all the way till the (hopefully not) bloody end of centralized money. 
Banks have dug their tendrils in so deep that they make us think we need them, when it's really the other way around. Banking is a business. It was a pretty good business for quite a while. Globally, they've become quite corrupt and they no longer serve the people, they serve wealth. When any industry stops being purposeful to society it goes away or it changes. It's that simple. And the banks don't seem to be so keen on the idea of change. It's time the people regained ownership their wealth. 
Do people forget so soon the great stock market crash? The bank doesn't have to give you "your" money.

To be fair there are members of the core dev team that have investments/ownership shares in exchanges and benefit from having full blocks and will continue to benefit if they continue to fail and then address scalability issues in a timely manner.

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:13:29
It really isn't. Those both seem like valid arguments, and in fact is the real purpose of blockchain technology -- no one can seize your money. The worst they can do is make you feel very sorry that you won't give them the money. They can't seize crypto the same way they can seize assets or cash from your home which puts governments in the position of having to earn their part of the taxpayer/payee relationship. It's going to raise a lot of interesting philosophical and socio-economical questions over the next several years.

Yeah that exact 1.5 hr maintenance time and back to business last night. I'm lucky enough I could see the non-moving exchange a half hour before trading started again, made a nice ping pong on the $250 LTC sell wall coming back in, rescooped it at $230 that first minute the exchange was back, and were soaring now. Gdax is great 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:06
Or if you're me, I rode my LTC from $90 and my ETH from $340 and pulled all my BTC (halfway stupidly) the first time it hit $16k. So it looks like now is a good time to move some of that back in :) Hope everyone is having a happy holidays, and if you bought late and lost a little buy more now and stay with us on the next uptick!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:00:13
It's an issue the core dev team continues to promise to address but fails to time and time again. Litecoin has already solved this issue, and Etherium is very close to doing so as well.

For sure, diversification is good and you won't hear me saying that gold is going to die. The market has just been losing value as people sell, and Bitcoin has been rising as popularity increases. Together, you'll start to see gold investors decide their money would be better held in another store of value for the coming year. All it takes is the majority of the market deciding something is no longer valuable, and suddenly it no longer is. But there will always be money there to pick up a market that's been around for so long, especially if it really does take a sizable hit
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:14:53
It's no different. $1000 in either is $1000 initial investment. What matters is gains. Just because you earn more Litecoin by holding doesn't mean you're earning more money unless Litecoin is seeing bigger gains

It's not about a "money-making" investment. There is certainly money to be made in trading, but this is an investment in a technology that is likely going to eat a percentage of forex's market cap. So the bet isn't so much that fiat currency is going to be replaced -- the bet is that the technology can compete stably in the foreign exchange  to the point that it will be a stable commodity like gold -- something that will hopefully go up a little because of intrinsic and implied value, and something that will likely never bottom out for the same reasons. Just like gold.

It's how Bitcoin works now. I'm honestly trying to read this comment chain and provide useful information, but it's already here and your only argument is "it isn't happening yet". When as a matter of fact, crypto has led to a boom in micro-lending following on an already high uptrend. This makes it easier and more profitable for both parties, seeing how there's far fewer/lower fees (and there will be even fewer/lower when LN goes live).
If you don't think we need a better micro-money transfer, you probably haven't tried a lot of cross-globe money moving. It's very expensive to move a small amount of money, and in most cases almost any crypto is cheaper to move.

Etherium's token system is inferior, you speak with a lot of depth to not even mention that as a factor in Etherium's growth.

Disagree. I watch all trends closely and Ethereum, while being affected by all crypto trends, does not adhere to the flat-follow trend that all the altcoins do.

My thoughts are the longer that core dev takes to implement LN, the more of the crypto market cap they lose to ETH, LTC, and XMR. ByteBall also has the widest usage case and API built to immediately start implementing SMS based sales bots and the likes so it's worth watching. And I know we're in BTC and we should hate Bcash, but it's going to be a very interesting experiment. We have two core concepts with about 9 years of evidence backing each, we'll see if the original white paper concepts are better than the roadmap that the core dev team is pursuing 
I do believe small block sizes are a bad idea and that Satoshi never intended this to be a block cap. It was to be extended as usage expanded

Never get rid of all of one crypto. As you can see, it can triple in a few days. I however bet on Litecoin following the uptrend a bit behind Bitcoin like it tends to. I lucked out and moved most of my portfolio to LTC after the first major downtick in the last uptrend, and climbed the last few days with a wild grin. It's a shame I only have so little to invest as my returns in both holds and day trading have been great

I would pick this apart but between 




I don’t think there’s anything I can say to you. I must have been seeing things for the $2k-$8k run that led to the bull run post fork and the rise from $600-$2k that only took two years. 
Hell, even in 2010 you should have known the future value would at least be larger than it was then, especially if you were mining from even early 2009 until 2010 prices, just like if you were there from 2010 until post-Mt. Gox you would’ve known even after the tumble it was headed back up. 
Or maybe some of us just have better gut feelings. Sorry, bud. 
By the way, buying dips off of a 2 year bull run is not a wise investment move, and I’d love for you to find me a *real* investor who would say otherwise. 
Why do all the bad crypto investors who lost on poor investments like to pretend like late 2015 to the bcash fork didn’t happen, and that it actually went from $300 to $19k over the 2017 holidays? That didnt happen. Sorry you slept.

I did write further down about the associated connotations with "bug" and "glitch", but the difference in use has narrowed in the digital age. Probably because there's not so many digital glitches, a lot of digital devices either work properly or don't work at all. There usually isn't an inbetween "functioning state" or "hiccup" like many analog devices could find themselves in. Digital "glitches" tend to cause issues in software operation rather than hardware interruptions (save complete hardware failure). Analog allows for mixed signals and the likes, digital is pretty much on or off.

Aye, thought you were thread OP. I was indeed disagreeing with him. I misread your comment as disagreeing with what I said, I apologize. 
Regardless, code written intentionally can have unintentional consequences. This is literally what one may call a "bug" or "glitch". The only point of contention I can think of (that no one is making use of) is that the connotational difference between the two is that a "bug" generally refers to software malfunction and a "glitch" typically refers to a hardware malfunction. 
I'm having trouble understanding why you seem to be saying that code can't have unintentional consequences just because it was written with intent. I've worked on a lot of pathfinding and behavioral AI systems, and let me tell you: you can have the best intent and most careful code construction in the world and still end up with some wild results. 
Sorry for the confusion
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:36:10
1) You should have had your seed. Period. No argument against that but stupidity. 
2) What does your mystery business have to do with this? If your business was failing, why are you diversifying into high risk investments? You’d be better off hitting Vegas or getting a second job at McDonald’s. 
3) You’re not investing right if you’re “buying dips”. That’s gambling. And you definitely shouldn’t be buying dips in the hopes of selling them for more somewhere in the short-term. Many people have advocated bitcoin’s rise for years — I was interested in the tech and quite the advocate myself, and even I bought in later than I would’ve liked. Waiting until the wrinkles were ironed out was not the best idea. Perhaps a good idea, but that would be like buying Google or Apple stock now — you won’t lose those bets, but betting on the horses after the race doesn’t make much sense does it?
It sounds to me like you bought right about the time everybody and their grandma hopped in on the “hot new get rich quick scheme”. Waiting until an investment is the hot topic around the world is plain goofy. Waiting until around the time Mad Money talked about it as a plausible investment is even goofier. 
I’m speaking to you with the benefit of foresight — you sound like you hopped on for the moon ride, not to be personally invested in a revolutionary technology. You shouldn’t be investing in crypto in the hopes that it’ll double or triple or moon *so that you can convert it to fiat*. You should be hoping that it increases *so that you can spend the crypto on goods and services in crypto* (still seeing your gains and continuing to support the growth of the tech and adoption). Any other mindset will leave you at a loss regardless of gains, and you’d be better off working with an investment firm to put your capital into a high-risk portfolio.
I will still never understand the people that see gains on an investment and don’t leave a hedge — if you just won your bet on which horse leads halfway around the track, wouldn’t you leave a little of your winnings on that horse for the win?
And by the way, many people who were aware of the hurdles ahead and aware of the jumps being made had a hunch about this bull run. Its not like BTC supporters started telling everyone to buy in September. It’s not like BTC has been sitting on a flatline and it suddenly hit $19k. It’s been making repeated long growth patterns that tend to follow major regulation/adoption/scalability news.
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:07:29
Exactly. Replied to a comment further up that insinuated one entity like Amazon could end up with “all the Bitcoin”. If a giant like Amazon accepted Bitcoin and there was so much adoption for that use case that they ended up with *literally all the Bitcoin*, at what point do we see Amazon start to try to use Bitcoin inside their own internal/adjacent economic functions? 
It’s not like if adoption on that scale happened that Bitcoin wouldn’t be soon used in adjacent functions like paying suppliers/employees/investors/taxes even? out in Bitcoin as much as possible. And at what point do those dominoes tip the next? I’m not sure yet the first domino is even going to fall over in the right direction, but it sure is wobbling.

It either grows or it dies and there will always be swings, but for all markets there’s kind of an invisible line that once you cross it the market can’t die unless the surrounding economy bottoms out. Think oil, land, gold. As for where that line is for Bitcoin, who knows? It has definitely proven its inherent value at this point.

Yeah just like $300+ to $23. I’m just curious why people seem to think there’s more empirical evidence for it to die completely than there is for it to recover.

Go ahead and say the technology is useless and will die because you didn’t get your Lambo off it.

The beautiful part about all this to me is a lot of parties have to take their masks off when they show where they stand on crypto. Anyone against a people's money is against the people. The list of confirmed fascist governments and authoritative bodies continues to grow...

Yes. The only way they allow it is if it was created by the NSA. Still one of my favorite theories to think that the U.S. saw the fall of the petrodollar coming and have been trying to create a world currency before it happens. You know, "if we can't control the money no one can control the money". Especially with the (very very slim) possibility that whoever developed SHA-256 has a backdoor to it.

Except that the world banks spent tens of billions of dollars and a decade in the late eighties through the nineties trying to develop this technology and couldn't in any way shape or form. Non-volatile electronic money is one of the biggest inventions in human history. It may change a few times before it settles on a "final" form, like the automobile did, but it will stick around. 
If your anecdote is actually saying good is useless, well... It took thousands of years to get to that point and it's actually still rather useful. And most of that is just because rhodium and palladium work better as a conductor in sensitive equipment.

Given how many times it’s risen and fallen and never gone back to $19, yeah, I think we know.

People act like crypto wasn't massively used when it's only real use was illegal dark market stuff. What makes people believe crypto won't survive unless Daddy Sam approves?

It is pretty impressive. I watched it fall from $300 to twenty bucks and thought, “if it doesn’t die now it’ll never go that high again”. Here we are a few lurches later and all the naysayers are playing the same broken record about the end of Bitcoin.

As far as I know alcohol typically can't be shipped in the U.S. because I don't think you can ship liquids undeclared if at all. Definitely can't have it shipped from a distributor to consumer. And as long as our federal laws are antiquated it is very illegal to mail weed for anyone, licensed distributor or not.

Well, right now transactions that authority doesn’t want you to make may mostly conform to society’s moral consensus of what transactions shouldn’t be made...
...but what happens when someone who has authority over your transactions and accounts decides they no longer want to oblige to societies ethical expectations? Should it be so easy to simply freeze or turn off an individual’s economic power in a world where losing these abilities entirely would be certain death?
Imagine your government decided to make your identity not exist. How would you survive? How would you escape? There is literally nothing feasible you could do in a situation like that.

What’s worse is that you aren’t put on trial, your money is. Literally. It has nothing do do with your innocence, you have to have some sort of documentation to prove the innocence of origin of the cash.

Wow, you’re clever. Yes, it’s actually like all previous centralized digital currencies. That’s what makes blockchain technology different than e-gold or DigiCash.

Yeah, rhodium and palladium are honestly the two most intrinsically valuable rare metals as of the current age.
