It’s not a feature, nor is dropping your wallet filled with cash off a boat in the ocean or a gold ring on the beach.
It’s poor management and will happen regardless of what medium you consider valuable.

See, was waiting for a response like this. I would push it to 2022. But there are more other factors than just this as well that people forget.
Ah to be 18 again..

Alt coin market is dead because if any institution or company wants to do anything with blockchain they are going to do it themselves. These partnerships are just so CTOs and project management teams can learn use cases of blockchains. look at some of these huge corps developing their own chains now... so yeah Then they will create their own.
Same way companies create their own fonts to not have to pay someone else for Helvetica, and just as easy as some mobile game making you purchase their “currency for fucking skins”.
No use case for TxFree coins because companies will utilize their own as well.
If ETH hits it’s mark, it will stay around as a development platform, but Bitcoin will always be the safest route.
It has name recognition, and at this point trust behind it and when you look at the list of deadcoins, no one in their right mind would take the risk to leverage serious money behind anything else. Otherwise they would log into fidelity and place their bets with something listed on the NYSE.
The trust is in BTC, not nano, not anything else. Safest bet is BTC.
Edit: Gonna live by my words and unsub CC too. Fucking shill playground.

@_date: 2019-08-08 13:09:48
NANO is shit.
Shitcoins are shit.
They will never recover.
BTC is still sitting way above average ATH.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:47:42
This pops 25/30 your gonna see a huge sell off again and a “BTC is dead” again, and then a accumulation again and then another surge.
People are not gonna buy something at 3.5k and wait to 100k to take profit. Would you in such a volatile market?
The bottom floor will continue to rise, but anything straight up like that is coming down rock hard.

Well the current crop of Democrats just all raised their hands to give their own constituents money and labor away to foreigners, for free. I could go on, but do you really think the jackasses are any different?
Did you pay taxes from the years 2010-2017?
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:31:49
To be honest, probably their Visa card. Ain’t nobody buying shitcoins for any other purpose but speculation at this point. Maybe MakerDao and possibly a few others.
The graveyard is quite large at this point and it keeps growing.

Bernie Sanders is a full blown socialist. There is nothing moderate about him by any measure.
To even draw a mild comparison between Bernie Sanders and actual moderates in the DNC is like trying to call Mao a capitalist.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:17:47
I’m happy for a drop slightly below 10 and again a steady rise. If it bounces off a couple times at 8,5 etc people will see it as the new floor and when it goes to 15 it won’t be cautiously seen as another balloon.
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:07:32
Yeah for real. lol

There will be a couple. But the overall shitcoin market, no. Not a chance. 
Price wise, too much sell pressure near recovery prices people will just cut losses or break even.
A lot of these projects can be replicated and replaced with private industries using private chains. Why use some shitcoin, when they can make and use their own system. Now that the tech has been out there in the spotlight more devs work with it. Be smarter to higher own devs
Lastly. Have you seen the list of dead coins and projects? It will only grow. With those that have taken BTC from others as the end result.
BTC has public trust behind it. It’s been around for a decade. People feel safer with that instead of some moon limbo coin.
The sentiment for that is everywhere. Even in this thread.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:33:20
Yeah man. That’s my point. It will pump and then people will sell again on a massive dump right to these people’s chest.
Shitcoins do one thing. Transfer BTC to someone else.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:14:46
LTC is shit. Charlie said so, that’s why we all sold at $300+ and never touched that shit again.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:12:31
Yeah and then people shit on BTC. I’d rather see swells building over time than white caps �� .
But people in this space are 90%+ trying to get rich quick instead of just trying to secure long term investments.
I quit that life long ago and look at BTC more towards a retirement outlook now. 
Steady as she goes boys.

I came from America not Europe. My ancestors did, maybe they saw the sorry sack of shit it would turn out to be. But in the end, I don’t plan on abandoning my country and becoming some beta cuck to a central unelected government.
In the meantime, we’ll work on our shit and continuing propping you up for another half century.

@_date: 2019-08-07 13:35:39
Yeah to BTC and ETH. Gotta give Doge some love and maybe like... 3 other coins.
There’s too much money in the top 50, but How many coins have dropped from that list over the years? Historical data from large and smart investors would keep them away.
Shitcoin pumps just transfer wealth, and BTC.
Made some lost some, but I’m never doing that shit again...

Terrible gauge, especially recently. Many more factors to Manhattan price changes than “a recession”. For every building leveled, a new 20 story luxury apartment goes up. Most of these buildings have tons of vacancies, so the prices between them become more competitive.
