You may not want to applaud this holding.  Rulings that Bitcoin constitutes a "real" currency open up a DOJ action alleging that Bitcoin constitutes an unlawful currency, violating federal law and the US constitution.  It opens the door for a serious shutdown.  Recent exchange forfeitures suggest that regulators are taking notice of Bitcoin and that it may be a serious target in the not so distant future.

They can seize exchanges, which will harm liquidity, and use asset forfeiture to target people they know accepted BTC to chill people out of the system.

This is an ethical complaint waiting to happen.  State bars are always butt hurt over *anything* related to technology, progress, competition, etc.

If a $2,500 miner yielded $9,000 a month, why would the manufacturer sell them for $2,500?

It's not an IOLTA issue, it's an issue that's brought up by the fact that you need a mountain of informed consent before accepting something other than currency as payment due to ethical rules.  There are major issues, including issues with valuation, at play here.  It's no different than claiming to accept stock certificates in exchange for your services.  I wouldn't do it.

Fuck no it's not legitimate.  Why on **earth** would an attorney need your place of birth, nationality, or date of birth?  If it's actually mail, why do they need your address, wouldn't they have that already?  If it's an e-mail, understand that attorneys don't typically use e-mail when making first contact with people, it's almost always certified first class mail.  
This reads exactly like every Nigerian scam on earth.
