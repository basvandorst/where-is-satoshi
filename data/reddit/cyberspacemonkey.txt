I put on the listing that I didn't accept returns but that the miner had 3 month warranty with the manufacturer. does that help?

Yeah, that's the thing. I never claimed on the listing that the machine was able to make money. Only the hashing rate which was accurately described, although sometimes the average is  different compared to the actual, and also sometimes the mining pool shows different hashing rate also, which is what worries me.

Thanks, that makes me a little less worried. I hope I get as lucky as you with customers.

but what about if they make a claim just a few weeks later? Paypal gives buyers up to 45 days to make a claim.

but what if he claims item was not as described?

But what if the buyer starts the dispute through Paypal and not ebay?

Have you ever had a problem with a customer complaining about the hashing rate that shows on their mining pool? because you know it can be different from the hashing rate showing on cgminer and it fluctuates a lot, going up and down. If so how to reply to that?

Here's what it says on the Paypal website:
Significantly Not As Described (SNAD):
Your customer filed a claim stating that the item they received was significantly different than what they ordered. For example, your customer ordered a red sweater and received a blue sweater.
 
If you follow eligibility requirements, PayPal Seller Protection will protect you from liability for unauthorized transaction and Item Not Received claims. Unfortunately, Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) claims aren't covered under PayPal Seller Protection.

that's pretty much what I'm asking for, a little advice as to how to do that.
