Well, if it's your family, the stakes have changed.

I'm by no means a very experienced trader, though. But yeah In terms of war I pretty much consider myself a very careful, precise general, I guess. I'd much rather wait for the enemy to be weakened by the other allied armies, and then send out small strike teams with little support to them so that if I lose them, the battle is far from over, and if I get to keep them and eliminate some of the enemies, I will have the trust of more soldiers that come over to my side. Not as many as if I had a crushing victory over much of the enemy with my entire army, but good enough for me to slowly but surely build my army stronger and stronger.  
Sometimes I send out messengers to other armies and try to coordinate strikes and attacks on the enemy, but this has often had big backlash, and I now try to keep independent and work like a silent predator in the night.

I'm pretty well off, but I'd kill someone if I was given *enough* money to do it. Enough being some number that would convince me. I just know that if there is enough of anything involved, anything can happen. Because it's enough.

Thank you! :D

YES! [EmmaSofia]( is an amazing operation here in Norway who are working to decriminalize and legalize the safer drugs and substances! If you could help them out a little, that would be amazing!

Any chance you could make a little tutorial for doing that with BTC on BitMEX for someone who's pretty new to market trading?

I look at crypto trading a little similar, except I look at it as a war, where the buy walls and the sell walls are two armies, and support is where the main group is and resistance is where the main enemy is, and so on and so on. For some reason this has made it much, much easier for me to "predict" pumps and dumps etc. It's not perfect, but it helps. Looking at chart is like weather. Wouldn't want to go invade Russia in the winter, would we! They're strong as hell then, compared to us. So I wait for our army's advantageous times and that's when I buy. I don't short, because only traitors join the enemy.

Bitcoin steady at $16.3

Hasn't people been saying this whole bubble thing every time there's a big rise? Value goes to i.e 10k, drops down to 5k or something, and stays there until the next rise. Like, people always call it a bubble, but it sounds to me like it's just a shitton of people having serious hype, and then it just stabilizes when the hype dissipates. I'm no expert, but this does sound like every time before it.

You're a good man.

Looks like it!

Instead of using your entire paycheck on only BTC, maybe split it between BTC and ETH, or some other altcoins incase they go big. I think that's what he meant. Or just in general use some money for fun, like going to the movies, weed, Netflix, weed, weed etc etc weed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:51
Yeah I agree. It didn't take me long to get started once I looked at it with this way :D
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:10:02
Yes, which is what I've been saying for people not to do. I (and others should) only put out money they can afford to lose.

Damn that's edgy!

Well he definitely wasn't alone in coding it. There are references by him to other people on BitcoinTalk posts he's made, and in changelogs.

I'll send you 9 10th of it. I'll use the remaining 10% for reinvesting hahah.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:11:22
He's talking about 2020. In 3 years.

2 boobcoins for each pair of boobies.  
  
*Boobcoin - The new big thing*
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:44
Basically the same thing by my standards. You put your money into something and hope you end up with more money after the amount of time you decide.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:32
One of these days boobcoin is gonna be worth 10k and I'll go bankrupt because I can't afford to pay for all the boobies I'm sent.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:25:53
My heart is broken on your behalf. Just realized the money I invested earlier in life and promptly used on drugs is now worth about 20k. I'll reinvest every week from now on and not use them. Just have them be there until I find some other coin that I'm sure will skyrocket or just stick to BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:20:36
Likely because they're so useful, but what do I know.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:20:43
I bought at whatever it is now. I just decided I would invest what I could afford to lose every week and I'll hope for long term increase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:44:14
Also, bitcoin apparently saved the Zimbabwe economy from collapse. I'd say that's a pretty useful thing if true.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:41
NO WAY!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:22:56
Of course it's a bubble. But if you're investing money you can't afford to lose it's your own fault. Just invest what you can afford to lose every week, and if it increases you'll be happy, and if it crashes, then you won't need to worry about it. Just like any stock.  
Oh, and I love tulips.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:48:06
That's a great way of looking at it!  
I'd say Ichimoku cloud (youtube dat shit) and just generally looking and analyzing the chart (tradingview works great, use BITMEX:BTC or whatever site you use for updated charts) is one thing that helped me a lot, in addition to talking to other traders. Experience is a big thing. Even if you just trade with 10 dollars to start, you can learn a lot from your gains and losses, like using only 50% or 33% of your total balance to trade so that you can always win it back. Don't get invested emotionally and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. The money you don't care about is what you should be putting into investing, not the money you'll need tomorrow or next week. ;)
