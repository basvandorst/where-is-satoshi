Let’s dig into the food or housing example though. You need food, but you need a farmer to grow the food. 
A farmer might have to borrow 1000 bitcoin to buy the land for the farm.  If the farmer thinks that land will only be worth 800 bitcoin in ten years- it might not make sense to make that investment. 
In addition- there’s now additional risk on the loan to the farmer- because he needed 1000 bitcoin up front to buy the land- but it’s worth less and less bitcoin over time (instead of appreciating against the deflationary fiat dollar). So to account for the risk- the farmer probably needs to pay more in interest. 
To make matters worse- if the farmer has the same crop yields every year- his sales will go down each year because maybe he can sell his crops for 200 bitcoin this year, but only 190 bitcoin the next year. That’s gonna make paying back his 1000 bitcoin mortgage tougher each year. 
Or on the housing note- if you’re a believer in bitcoin- if you think it’s value is going up each year, would you be comfortable taking out a 50 bitcoin loan to buy a house?  If you get a 4% loan over 30 years on 50 bitcoins you’d be paying 0.239 bitcoins back every month until 2049. That could be a nightmare.

Henry Ford died in 1947- when did he say this?  Curious what the banking and monetary system looked like when he said it as I’m guessing the white was when the US was on the gold standard.

On the flip side of this- most ordinary orders owe more in USD than they have in USD. 
Person A- 30k in student loans, 2k in a bank account, money invested in a 401k- but in stocks so not devalued by my inflation. 
Person B- 5k in student loans 150k mortgage, 3k in a bank account, additional money invested in stocks/401k. 
Would you rather person A owes 3 bitcoin in student loans- which will never inflate away their value?  
Would person B be better off paying off 15 bitcoin in their mortgage over the next 30 years?

Matters more on the investment side. If I expect inflation at say at 2%, then I’m ok spending my money now (or going into debt) to finance an investment - say upgrading my business - that returns 5% - particularly if I have to pay only 4% interest. 
On the other hand, if there’s an inflationary currency that gains 5% per year, I wouldn’t make that same business investment - because even if the loan I could get is just a tiny risk premium above zero percent- it would be better for me to hold my money instead of investing.
