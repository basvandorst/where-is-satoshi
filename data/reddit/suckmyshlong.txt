Not everything is an attack, calm down

This is embarrassing

So why did bitcoin's 1mb take years to fill?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:58:23
If he had been transacting much with bitcoin lately would he be so satisfied with it's current fee "market" 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:00:16
Nobody thinks 8mb will solve or achieve visa level scaling. It will however relieve considerable pressure on the network and allow space for bitcoin to further grow, expanding its user base naturally. You don't raise the blockchain and suddenly have visa level demand for transactions.

Bitcoin cash is not rejecting the possibility of second layers, they would approach things differently (flexible transactions) and 2nd layer would complement on-chain transactions. Users shouldn't be forced onto things like LN by high transaction fees caused by an antiquated max block size. Also putting all your eggs in one basket slightly by banking on an untested solution such as LN to alleviate all bitcoins scaling problems?
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:43:13
Nobody is spamming it because it would have no effect. Last time someone tried all the "spam" was cleared with one 8mb block.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:12:59
I meant untested on the network proper. It is my understanding that there remains some critical issues that need to be ironed out with LN if it is to be the scaling solution it is touted to be on here. With regards to bitcoin cash, it has surprised me how well it is doing particularly after it was written off on arrival. Now price is rising and hash rate is sure to follow, compounding the scaling problems present in legacy bitcoin. No one can tell for certain the future and it's probably best to conserve your coins on both chains.

Bitcoin cash Devs don't need to know how to implement LN just as core Devs don't, look up who is developing LN...
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:57:18
Bitcoin reached its capacity a while ago now, if there is space to conduct transactions next week it will be because people have stopped trying completely out of frustration or been priced out. This is not good for bitcoin and pushes users onto working solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:15:35
If you haven't made a transaction with a fee over $1 in recent times then you can not have been transacting much at all. You therefore have to question whether it is even necessary for you to run your own full node.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:29:06
That is pure conjecture on your behalf. Thanks for the mostly polite conversation.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:10:50
I know, let's ignore the fact that the network is becoming less and less useful for more and more people. As long as the price goes up then brilliant, until you actually go to send a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:28:50
Who has made any and all proposed hardforks contentious? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:17:22
Goalposts would be moved again, "node count doesn't matter, here look at this twitter poll I found."
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:25:19
Not every block is 8mb, even if it took all bitcoin transactions the blocks would likely stay below 2mb for a while. Having the ability to clear massive transaction backlogs is a feature that prevents the kind of escalations in fees we have seen before.

Nice editing

R/BTC is not one single person and you will find a number of people supporting different ideas.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:13:31
Do they still count as shitcoins if some of them actually work as intended?
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:06:54
At least they will finally have consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:09:27
At some point down the line if we want to see real large scale adoption bigger blocks will be necessary. You cannot rely solely on LN as this still requires the use of on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:16:29
If you want a meaningful vote then the answer is invest in hashpower. To get a meaningful vote in a multi-billion economy will take a meaningful financial investment.

He's talking about the discount for witness data.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:27:50
Quite refreshing to see differing opinions on here rather than one massive circle jerk
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:01:09
I think having multiple competing implementations can be healthy for bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:59:09
I think you might end up disappointed if you believe that.
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:34:09
Maybe they just don't like the proposal.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:34:37
The original 95% level was never going to be met by miners without an associated blocksize increase, that's why it stalled at &lt;40%.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:10:58
That's not an unreasonable idea to have. I think however that 148 lacks any significant support and segwit may not even activate on the chain given the low hash rate supporting it. That may change between now and 1 Aug but I don't expect it to.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:02:13
Different opinion to me therefore shill.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:28:49
I thought people only became aware of asicboost in the last month or 2?
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:25:50
I think miners would have preferred a larger increase/EC but as a way of compromise have settled on a 2x increase.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:25:41
I don't really understand what you're trying to say?
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:56:38
What did he say that was wrong rather than dismissing him solely on account age?
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:39:58
People will be forced onto them if user adoption increases without the block size increasing in tandem.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:09:04
How does one accurately measure decentralisation?
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:31:22
It's the cumulative size of transactions in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:49:14
Firstly I said if user adoption continues, secondly when fees kept rising I reduced the number of transactions I was making and I'm sure many others did too?
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:35:58
The price of anonymity is usually higher transaction sizes and therefore more strain on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:27:26
Segwit clearly doesn't have overwhelming consensus, saying it does doesn't​ make it so 
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:28:17
Even if blocks had been made that large they would only be as full as demand dictated?
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:21:08
Lightning still requires the use of on-chain transactions when setting up new channels
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:10:44
The question is how do you define a transaction as a shit transaction, if it pays a sufficient fee to be added to a block I'd argue that transaction deserves to be included in the blockchain as much as any other.
