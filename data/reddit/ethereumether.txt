not sure if trolling or misusing the miner fee for block reward. if btc cost 50$ per transaction, that is the "miner fee" that is costing that...  
what you must be mixing up is the "block reward" since it goes to the miners you prolly mixed that up. or maybe ur just trolling? giving you the benefit of the doubt

trump is the man, he knows printing more money will put more money into usdt tether, and will put more into btc. go ahead run the press full steam ahead! lets print some USD so we can then use that to back the printed USDT, which we can then use to buy BTC. trump is a very smart man. hes been a businessman and millionaire from young age. if anyone knows economics and business and money. its trump. dont let his simple words fool you.

i dont care much for politics and pro/anti either,
i dont know the history of which casino bankrupt. but im sure he owns many casinos if not more then dozen, also many resorts, many hotels, many buildings (an skyscrapers at that), many land all over the states prolly off the coast too. sometimes bankruptcy is part of the game. i dont know the accounting laws and how bankruptcy falls into place. but 50cent one of the best businessmen also filed bankruptcy. hes still one of the best though? sometimes filing bankruptcy isnt what it seems. there can be other factors at play that come into affect. there is balances and books that need to get accounted for and filing bankruptcy can avoid certain taxes and certain revenue taxes. again im not an accountent and its not my field. but i would assume he knows what hes doing.

ok but look at the last 10 years not just the last year. not much has changed since last year, other then ico market booming 10x more then 2015 altcoin boom
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:40:29
"why bitcoin will boom in 2018  
\&gt;except more then half of 2018 is over, only 4 months left, and we already down from 20k to 6k.
so unless we going above 20k within 4 months.

imagine having to explain to someone bitcoin is just playing minecraft abliet a more advanced version
@_date: 2018-10-13 08:11:20
this is true, but the problem is, most governments and banks are NOT HONEST.  
thats why they see bitcoin as a threat. eitherway bitcoin doesnt ask for permission. sooner or later they will either have to adopt and use bitcoin. or become obsolete. im pretty sure they will use their own crypto that will be backed by btc. btc will not be for everyone. but most things will be backed by btc imo

i am also long time user of hitbtc, and they will not return bat tokens that was sent to them on accident. i even see on blockchain that they moved them. so i know they have the tokens. but refuse to give back. i have done all kyc and everything they demand. but its never enough they always find a reason, after months of countless emails and giving them every info they want. seems like they just collecting identities at this point. and who knows they might even be selling identity to others. sometimes things go fine but once something messes up, good luck because their customer service either has no idea whats going on, or is purposefully playing dumb.

.618 for bch/btc? wow thats crazy! would be amazing to see that
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:43
30bil marketcap rise on bch in 2days, and its still going up. the correction going to hurt so many people. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:42:10
why is it oversold or undervalued? cost of mining is still lower then the price. and potential value can be super high. but who says thats the value now and its currently undervalued?
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:37:38
does this node give the ability to open channels and help propagate btc with the hopes of recieving some tx fees some day. i know it might be low now, but would this be a good option, i saw some videos on making lightning nodes and showed needs to be well connected and many channels ect. so wondering if this is supported in ur hwnode

just give him a btc address. and tell him send me .01 btc and ill do it for you. i dont do work until im first payed. surely if they have .8btc they can easily give you .01btc for your time and work?
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:23:23
in that case, invest in a shitcoin, and market it. better yet just make ur own shitcoin or erc20 token. kinda 2017 but it can still be done with enough diligence. just need the proper shilling skills, maybe hire some ppl on fiver to help shill it. once its listed on a major exchange u dump. easy 100x or so if done properly.

most likely a bart here. we already know this pattern after months of proof
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:14:06
um you dont need prayer. btc is deflationary by nature. just give it time. it will be worth more. all you really need is patience. monetezation will come into effect after time. be patient and you will see your btc worth alot. just like over time the dollar value decreases. over time the btc value increases. really no need to be in a rush. give it 5years and 20k price will sound like a steal

opening a new bank account, teller asks for all assets i own, teller asks if i own bitcoin, "whats that?"
