Communicating is hard, we shouldn't try to do it correctly.

I hadn't had a chance to see this; apologies.
I have no advanced education, it's autodidaction all the way.  None of that matters though, because your interpretation of what I'm trying to do is all on you.  I want people to use language correctly.  What other way would you recommend me to do that?  Should I just shut the fuck up and sit down?  
I'm not sure, but it seems that the issue lies with individuals being unable to deal with criticism.  Though, I don't think that this is the individual's fault, it seems to be systemic.  When you're wrong it seems that the default (at least for American society) is to be wrong all the time.  If you're wrong once, you must be wrong about everything all the time.  This is, of course, incorrect; but it provides a lot of the same logic base that you used to imply that I'm trolling reddit/forums/et al. to correct people.  
I am truly sorry that you feel frustrated, being wrong about something shouldn't throw one into such a dead end.  The path forward should be presented (a correction, in this case) clearly and provide one with feeling that the path can be taken and the journey completed.

Make it transactable...it's not now, but if we can get there, we will start using it as "real money".

I have issues with people misusing language.  For you to superimpose my critical feedback onto the entirety of me as a person, well it's insipid. 
I'm not frustrated with your leaving of the error, I'm happy that you engaged with me.  It means that you took some time out of your day to admonish my critique.  Maybe you won't change, maybe there won't be any impact beyond your sordid affair with grammar, I don't know.  I do know that what I am and what you think of me are two entirely different things.
I apologize that you feel threatened, I didn't mean to critique you with anything other than feedback.  If you felt as though I'm emotionally invested, you are wrong.
I really hope that you move forward with your mistake and correct it in the future.  If you continue to misuse, well it's not going to be me that will be critiquing you.
No hard feelings, in fact none at all.  No matter how upset you are, or you think I am, have a wonderful day.

*than.  Then is representing time, as in something happens then something else.  Than is a comparison, you can remember it by the way it is.

The savings in transaction costs alone justify the use.

I had a chance to say that.

These are awesome critiques, do you mind if I source this for the founders?  I'm not affiliated (meaning I'm not employed or mining), but I do know them and this is extremely good feedback.
Thank you.

Is zcash on anyone's radar?  I mean that's its claim to fame is the whole anonymity thing.

Which is strange because drug freedom has freedom in it, and the repubs (god I hate claiming such things, I'm a fucking fiscal conservative) love their freedom...fries.

I like to think of FSM as a php spaghetti code developer.  He would be proud.  I would think a mantra might consist of, "Re-factor this!" or something.

This makes me want to watch back to the future, again.

I hate loosing the gains.

The idea is greater than your criticisms.  Time will tell if the application of that idea will be, but I'm confident.

Because it has a lot of shit you're interested in and you can fight your good fight.  Just because someone has some counter-examples and states a fact that makes you cringe, shouldn't cause you to cower and leave; you should rise and fight!  That way you can use all of your logical weapons against all of us illogical idiots and really see who wins the day, nay, the war!

I don't care, I'm doing it: [Reddit Enhancement Suite]( (usually repeated a million times, but I got a look of disapproval and a message about how annoying it is...wow, just wow; you're getting some more donations from me)
