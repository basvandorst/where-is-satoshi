On-chain would only be needed to open and close channels.  LN hubs will come about as a convenience for users to minimize the number of channels they need to participate in which further lowers on-chain transactions.  The majority of users would probably end up using LN with a hub.  We would then have to reevaluate if the block size would need to be increased, but it definitely seems like it would be much less pressing.

He has said numerous times that he sold some of his BTC for BCH. Your statement is completely false. This is not to say he actually did, who knows, but he did say that he did.

How many on-chain transactions did this require?  My understanding of LN is that you need a transaction to open and close the channel, but while it is open you can do an arbitrary amount for free.  Was this your experience?  
  
Did you open and close the channel for one transaction? If you did, why didn't you send a regular transaction on-chain and pay less overall fees instead of using LN?

No this is a wallet so you'd have to make an on-chain transaction to move the coins. An exchange holds all your funds for you in their own wallets, this is you holding your own funds in your own wallet. This is why you'll see references about being your own bank. These references are referring to you being able to hold your funds in a wallet that cannot be accessed by anyone else.

Their strategy is to limit block sizes so that LN is adopted.  Whether you agree with this strategy or not, all bitcoin users will eventually be using LN because you'll be fee'd-out of being able to use the main chain.  "Don't like it?  Use something else." (paraphrased from core)  
  
At this point is seems unlikely blocks will ever increase.  It goes against the LN plan.  To increase blocks is to lower fees, and to lower fees is to make LN less useful.  If LN is the future, then we must keep 1MB blocks.

A paper wallet is essentially just your public and private keys written down on a piece of paper. This ensures that the keys are not stored electronically. If you generate and print the keys from a PC that's never been connected to the internet then the expectation is that it is safer because the private key has never been exposed to a networked computer.  
  
In addition to paper wallets there are hardware wallets, which many find to be comparable in security and easier in accessibility.  The Ledger Nano S and Trezor are two popular options.

How on earth did you come to this conclusion?  It is certainly a good thing the bug was remediated so quickly, but there were coins that weren't even affected by this bug.

That wasn't my question though.  If we know how many exchange-to-exchange transactions are filling up the blocks then we could estimate the effectiveness of Liquid's ability to reduce block usage, as you said.  But if you *don't* know, then this is just a guess and may not be much of a benefit at all.  Do we know how much of the blocks are exchange-to-exchange transactions?
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:29:34


Does that mean that the minimum number of required honest participants has effectively been raised from 51% to 66% for Bitcoin?  
  
I know the question doesn't apply to Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin is still 51%.  But if we assume a large amount of Bitcoin is to be timelocked in Liquid, and those coins are now subject to Liquid security, then those coins are effectively more vulnerable than the ones on the main blockchain.

Do we know how many transactions between exchanges are currently in the blocks?

What could a malicious 3rd party do that can be adverted if I ran my own node? Most people probably don’t run nodes, are you saying they’re all at risk?  
  
I don’t understand your point on DDOSing. Why would there being more non-mining nodes influence this?

How does a non\-mining node contribute to network security?

Those all existed before the fork. The community split due to a disagreement on how to improve. You make it sound as if some malicious people forked the network then created a bunch of accounts called "Bitcoin" to try to confuse people. All that stuff was already in place and being used, they just didn't agree over the upgrade path so all those people just moved and continued on.
@_date: 2019-04-27 12:59:50
You have a bizarre interpretation of the other side. They just want to use a crypto that is quick and cheap so they can use it to buy stuff, which is what this community used to want too. Some here still want the same thing with lightning. You make it sound like it's some sort of cult. It's not.

What is a checkpoint?
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:15:25
Pretty sure it’s a rolling checkpoint though? As in, each new block the “checkpoint” becomes current-10. Since 10 block reorgs is absurd to accept anyway, it doesn’t seem like this is really a problem. Hasn’t Bitcoin only ever reorged 1 block deep in its entire history? If that’s true (it might not be, only what I heard) then 10 would only ever happen in an attempted robbery situation.  
  
Edit: also I think that’s an option the miners can set. It defaults to 10 but can be changed.

BCH has changed more than just the block size.

This is a weird dude.  
He says he will accept 101 if it reaches consensus, but consensus comes by spreading an idea and by proving its merit through discussion and debate. However, he seems dead set on preventing any debate until after it is accepted by the majority.  
I suppose he doesn't realize the logical inconsistency of what he is saying or how obvious it is to even a casual reader.  
  
I have no opinion about 101 and don't really care, but I find this all very strange.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:30:43
That reasoning is inconsistent with his statements though. He has said if 101 reaches consensus then it would become Bitcoin and it would be acceptable to discuss. His own statement negates the position that he considers the change to destroy Bitcoin and therefore not be a relevant topic. I believe my point stands that he consistently contradicts himself on this subject.
