I don't in any way mean to imply that people should feel bad about using bitcoin. 
I just mean to point it out to anyone who, like me, feels they missed a golden opportunity 3 years ago. The reason I didn't bother with bitcoins back then was because the only outlet I knew for them was silkroad, and some sites trading hacking services. However those people who did have a purpose for bitcoins back then are possibly extremely wealthy now if they held on to their early bitcoins.

Well, I mean illicit by its exact definition: "Forbidden by law"
but it doesn't mean I agree with it. I believe Marijuana should be legalized, and we should have mandatory rehab for hard drugs instead of jail time, but it doesn't change the fact that they are currently illegal, thus some people possibly became millionaires from illegal activities.
It's just an effect of the bitcoin story that I don't think a lot of people have thought about. I find it humorous, some people will find it shocking, either way I just felt like I should share it.

It was sort of the same for me also. Early on I farmed for bitcoins just for the heck of it. At one point I may have had about half a bitcoin, which was worth maybe $1. Now there's no way I could recover my wallet, which would be worth at least $300.

quite possibly. For some reason everyone is assuming I made this post to paint Bitcoin in a negative light. I actually find the idea that Drug dealers became millionaires extremely amusing.
