I can be charity =) In all seriousness, a scavenger hunt could be an interesting charity towards the bitcoin community itself. This used to be a fun hobby between a (relatively) few people. All of this big money coming in has certainly changed the community. There is too much focus on investing and mooning, and not the tech and improving our economic system as a whole.
edit: Following up on the community idea, perhaps get some youtube stars from around the nation or globe to assist with the localized implementation and marketing of the hunt. (Probably better than picking random folks from the internet, as the youtubers have an image to protect) This would get even more people involved and indirectly, raise the value for everyone else who didn't succeed in finding a drop. I'd even look into the idea of getting some middle/high school math and science departments involved too. Kids are going to be responsible for the continuity of crypto/blockchain and it's hard for them to get involved with the increasing barrier to entry for someone under 18.

Yeah... we're going to need you to place that in the basket to be scanned. It's a new routine security policy, nothing to be alarmed about.  -TSA Agent

In light of the Bitcorn attention I have placed it on ICO.
It was originally meant as an inside joke among a few friends.
We always had a friend who randomly hopped off chat so much we called him bambi. The only way to get him back was to lay out the deer corn. This happened so much we decided to make BitCorn to keep track of our bets.
Now you too can own your very own Bitcorn!

It's a shame we have so many shitty charities out there. I like to pick on the American Red Cross. They are great for training and certifications but so wound up in in bureaucracy during emergencies. I have nothing but respect for the volunteers, just contempt for many of their policy makers. Example: They have a shelter with hundreds of people and they don't have enough supplies as is normal in a crisis. So the local community brings in supplies to help out. Nope, Red Cross says they can't accept on the scene donations (only money). Everything given to the shelter clients has to be from red cross. They put their logo on everything too. From the cots and blankets to the foam to-go boxes. SMH

Yey, it is an angry and unforgiving Cryptomarket. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! We must hodl and buy only the essentials, bread, water, and margaritas. Yey!

plot twist: His wife has more bitcoin than him.

I always tell my wife when she turns 40 I'm trading her in for two 20s. (She knows I'm joking; we both have weird humor)

I finally ended up getting my btc back but I lost out on some good trades while I was held hostage.

How do you transfer USD between exchanges. ACH transfers take so damn long. **edit:** replied to the wrong comment but you guys get the point.

Yes, but only if your device is secured, keys backed up, and back up keys secured.
