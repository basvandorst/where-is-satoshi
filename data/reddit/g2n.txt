Assume I sent the funds from TOR to my other wallet running on my normal service?
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:52:43
If I use that website, can I get the .dat file for the wallet? Or is it stored there?

I didn't defend U.S. currency (I don't like fiat currency in general) but at the very least, its value is insured and backed by the country. I generally split up my assets; call me crazy but I buy gold, guns, silver, electronics, stocks, bonds, and I keep cash.

Using the bitcoin.org software?

Now I regret not buying these coins.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:01:36
Yeah. That's true. But people will always pay for silver because it is used in a lot of consumer goods. I just don't think that a virtual dollar is worth 420 real dollars, so like you said, I'm not willing to pay for it.

For 420 dollars I could buy 21 ounces of silver.

You may or may not be able to help me here: but I'm running tails and I generated my key pair. Now what? How do I check my balance and what not? I have the bitcoin-qt software on another machine but I don't want to put that anonymous wallet into it.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:02:37
Should I have two wallets, mine with one, and then transfer everything to the private one using obscure methods?
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:47:24
But the material it is made out of doesn't reflect the real value.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:00:42
400 dollars is a large investment for something that isn't tangible.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:17:48
Knowing my luck, they will drop when I buy them.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:41:12
I know you can purchase any amount. What I'm saying is that I believe the prices are just inflated. There is no stability in that currency, and I suspect people will lose a lot of money soon. I just don't want to take that kind of risk.
