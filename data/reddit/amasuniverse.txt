Give up. I made 70000 in crypto and online vending and my mum still treats me like I'm lazy and all I do is use the computer even though I literally started with £0.00 and turned it to £70000 and all I do is help people in the family and buy the kids toys and work and university. To that generation the only legitimate way of making money is slave labour. You can't change their mindset - they've been working for 50 years to save what you made in a year so it feels like it must be a scam

I haven't cashed out yet. I will cash out when Im ready to buy property. Im in the UK too. 
When I choose to cash out I'll probably either find someone who wants to buy in cash, find someone who's account could handle to deposit and use them or just cash out with my bank and negotiate with them. Im sure you can buy gold with bitcoin or something with bitcoin that you can then trade for fiat.

Here are the differences BCH supporters seem to not understand:
**Is bitcoin the best way to make fast, secure payments?**
No. 
**Will it be with increased block size?**
**Is bitcoin the best store of value at the moment?**
*Yes*. 
**Can it eventually be the best way to make fast, secure payments after multiple tech improvements?**
*Yes* 
**Is increasing block size the best way to make bitcoin eventually become the best way to make fast, secure payments?**
**Are there ways not yet thought of to make bitcoin eventually become the best way to make fast, secure payments?** Most likely
**Who is more likely to come up with a way to make bitcoin eventually become the best way to make fast, secure payments?**
*Probably the developers with a proven track record and in depth understanding of the bitcoin network, as opposed to entirely new programmers coupled with rogue miners*
In other words what BCH are doing is plucking unripe fruit because they are hungry, despite the fact that their hunger is not life-threatening and the fruit will not sate their hunger. 
Game, set, match in my opinion. And I hold both.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:14:51
The US dollar is not good at what it does, its just widely used. In the same way, bitcoin isn't the best at what it does, but we do need to to become more widely used because its better than fiat for its use case (both as a store of value and as a medium of exchange).

hes cashing out which means hes making his funds liquid so he cant go wrong by waiting a year and renting because hell get 1 year rent values worth anyway and if there is no dip he doesnt have to buy back in and is in the same position as if he didnt rent for a year. 
Dont tell me I 'havent been here long enough'when you didnt even understand the scenario. For someone cashing out to fiat, maintaining 50% aside for potential reinvestment is a good idea

Fucking thank god someone else realises that tech improvements are not what has been driving bitcoin adoption. Youre spot on 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:07:08
The problem is that bitcoin isn't the best medium of exchange as far as cryptos are concerned and so its only real current use case is as a store of value. If the price was to increase to a level that was high enough to be a realistic estimation of its value then I would argue that it should be improved as a medium of exchange, but to improve it as a medium of exchange now is to say that improving transactions is what needs to be done to improve bitcoin, which is palpably false

If people started storing money in bitcoin instead of banks that would be hugely disruptive. On top of that bitcoin doesnt need to be the best medium of exchange (which it isn't) and segwit2x would still not make it better than multiple cryptos I can name as a medium of exchange. It just needs to be better than fiat as a medium of exchange, which it is

Ive been of the opinion for a long time that bitcoin is an *asset* because it has an inherent value due to the work done to provide security, in the same way that crude oil has inherent value because it contains STORED POTENTIAL. 
It is also a currency, because despite what Wall Street says, being an asset and a currency aren't mutually exclusive. 
The fact that our financial system cannot account for bitcoin and its dualities is simply a case of the financial system being archaic

also people have been making the store of value argument since the beginning, I just think that 'better medium exchange than fiat' became conflated with 'best medium of exchange'. If the price of bitcoin starts to drop it wouldn't mean bitcoin isn't a good store of value because if the price of bitcoin started to drop it would rebound with ferocity. This is like saying gold wouldn't be a good store of value if the price dropped.. wrong because as soon as people see the opportunity to get some cheap gold they would jump at the chance.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:10:10
Im saying the ARGUMENT ISNT ABOUT WHETHER ITS FASTER OR CHEAPER so thats irrelevant. BCH isn't the fastest and cheapest coin so why are you not at the fastest and cheapest coin? Youre making a non-argument

No because an increase of 1000% is greater than an increase of 40% that bitcoin might experience. Then you can just buy back at the perfect time because you have enough market power
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:28:02


... and in addition will mean that only people with access to huge amounts of energy (read: corporations) will be able to run nodes feasibly (read: have percentage control of bitcoin network).

Bro you are a complete fucking idiot. It literally hurts. Im describing the fact that there is tangible demand and use for bitcoin. Millions of people are internet 'criminals' in case you didn't realise. 


YOU ARE FUCKING STUPID AND DONT KNOW HOW TO DO MATHS. Falling 20% COMPARED TO SOMETHING ELSE is different from falling 20% COMPARED TO ITSELF. 
If the value of the dollar falls 20%respective to the dollar, then yes, you get 20% of your purchasing power. Thats how numbers work your stupid fuck. What you are trying to say is that bitcoin is more volatile, which is true, but isn't an argument against accepting 


A lot of people fucking do and its a major flaw to fiat. 'Banks won't steal your money' LMAOOO JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP WTF DO YOU THINK THE GOAL OF A BANK IS?? THEY LITERALLY TAKE YOUR MONEY and give you less than 1% interest after using your money to make like 50% interest or more. That is the definition of taking your money. But of course you don't understand how money works. 
SO here, give me $100 of your money so that next year it can be worth 90$ and I am holding it so legally speaking its not actually yours. I give you 0.5% interest for holding your money for a year and now your money is worth less. This is central banking, you're just too stupid to work it out. 
Im not too stupid to acknowledge the problems bitcoin faces, but your 'problems' are fucking stupid
Here are your problems:


me: millions of people use bitcoin, please see bitcoin transaction logs and you will see people using bitcoin


me: yes, its volatile. Anything can fall 20% 


me: banks literally take your money and you don't own your money once you put it in the bank. Fucking learn what a bank is before you talk


me: ...bitcoin has a purpose right now
you: ... durr!! I own bitcoin just kidding! 
Literally an idiot contrarian 
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:34:51

@_date: 2017-09-17 11:46:23
what are you talking about, those advantages are specific to bitcoin and bitcoin is the first and largest of its kind. Its use being more widespread has nothing to do with confidence, its to do with exposure and the fact that it was the first of its kind.. half the people using it don't understand it. You're literally talking complete shit lmao
'The current bitcoin valuation is based upon people having confidence that bitcoin specifically will take off and that when it does they will be grandfathered in. It's not about cryptocurrency' This comment makes absolutely no sense. 
The valuation is based on widespread exposure and it actually being a better form of currency not 'confidence'. Stop undermining bitcoin just so you can sound 'smart'

Well put it this way, I was a deep web vendor for 2 years and had about an extra 50 people a day on my phone trying to buy spamming tools and fraud items with bitcoin so I actually understand the economy unlike you pretenders on this sub. 
It is infinitely better to use BTC. I know because fraud has been done on my visa twice and the bank didn't pay me back. You can use bitcoin for literally anything, don't kid yourself. Theres multiple sites that accept bitcoin, at this point you can buy anything. 
If the btc price falls 20% I lose 20% of my purchasing power. Okay? Same with any other currency.
Lmao millions of people use bitcoin as a currency. Understanding this is literally the difference between someone who knows what they're talking about and someone who doesnt. 
It has an enormous purpose and is extremely underrated considering how many people buy things on the internet. Buying things with escrow + crypto is literally a millionfold better than buying things with a fucking visa. 
Have fun accepting a payment of 20k with your bank without them closing your account because they don't think you deserve to accept that much money. 
'That's not to say BTC wont have a purpose in the future' then shut up, what is the point of your rambling if you clearly know that btc has a future purpose. 
Saying it has a future purpose is literally the same as saying it has a purpose now, the only difference is you don't want to think for yourself so you're waiting for everyone else to say that bitcoin is what they use before you back it. Either that or your just being contrarian and talking for the sake of talking

@_date: 2017-09-19 00:19:53
Okay I'll explain because you may not understand how the site works
Local bitcoin is made up of physical sellers and buyers. Sellers sell for the most they can get and buyers buy for the cheapest. 
When using localbitcoins, it is quick and easy to buy bitcoin. It follows that some sellers will list prices higher than others. All sellers will list prices either at or slightly above the market price so that there is an incentive for them to sell. 
What you're asking is like asking 'why do shopkeepers not sell chocolate bars for the amount they bought them for'
obviously you're going to sell above market price so that you're not selling at a loss. Are you literally retarded or something? 
Furthermore even normal exchanges overestimate market price. 


yeah I already fucking explained that people don't give a fuck that they're paying more because.. its not that big of a fucking deal. 
Perfect example of someone without a brain talking for the sake of it
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:35:27
because if you are buy 0.1 bitcoin, then being 100 over the market price is $10. Btc fluctuates by that amount like every second
