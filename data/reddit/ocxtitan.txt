If it's at a loss, absolutely.

fair point

Yup, even though I simply follow this sub for news and am only in alts, watching them tank/dip/correct/crash/whatever term you want to use here along with btc the last few times I'm just like "man, I wish I had some fiat to buy these dips"
Beyond that, I'm still WAY ahead of what I'd have if I kept my fiat out of crypto.

In crypto, there is almost always a day things come back up to where you bought them. ATH's rarely stay that way for long, though I personally wanted to get in on some other coins before they took off so I did make the tough decision to sell some of the kucoin coins I had purchased right before the correction which means they were at like 40-50% price of what I paid, but timing is key and I didn't think I had time to wait.

Until he died, pulling a Paul Walker sounded like a pretty good thing

Oh I think he was, but still

Think the attention to bitcoin will be good for all the best alt coins as well? I'm just curious, honestly haven't been paying much attention if bitcoin has ever had any spikes due to media attention so I was curious if there was history on it

I prefer 5 sat bat attack when you can buy a Louisville Slugger for 5 sats

Honest question - would it be prudent to convert my ETH over to BTC to see how the fallout is from the BBT episode? Anyone have any solid guesses as to how this sort of mass advertisement could affect prices?

You do realize you don't need trillions of money to enter the market to hit trillions of MC, right?
