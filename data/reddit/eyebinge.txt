I am currently waiting for Monaco to release their card. Their Asian launch should be in the next 2 months with a European launch following.

Win win.
Hopefully seeing your holdings rising every month will be far more satisfying than smoking. Good luck.
Also fuck vaping.

I think your wanting to get into Bitcoin for the wrong reasons. Do some of your own research and make sure you are clear on your motives.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:47:07
I agree with you to an extent, however I am fully aware that a currency is only going to change the world if its worth something. People need to see value in it before it can change the world. Currently we are in a bit of an ugly spot were value is the driver of progress. When mass adoption begins Bitcoin will really begin to change the world.

I wouldnt say they were hidden fees. They are right there on the card page on their website.

Based on what evidence? Most corrections we have had this year were caused by outsider influence like China, Bcash, futures and the Segwit non fork so cant be applied today.

All the best, great to hear these potential life changing improvements because of bitcoin.

I was having the same thought, they will definitely be looking at a way to make this a double pay day.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:43:21
Why not just transfer your Bitcoin to another wallet?

What is your reasoning behind the surge on thanksgiving?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:23:16
I didnt say that I did, I simply asked what pl0m thought as he obviously disagrees with OP.

Moderation definitely needs to be stepped up as the sub is really getting blocked up with useless questions that are easily answered from the side bar or discussion thread.

People are still using coinbase?

Not much different than putting a loan all on black, but probably slightly better odds. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:40:05
In reference to betting on black on a roulette table. 50/50 chance that you ether double or loose all your money. 
I wouldn't get a loan, people have though and done well. It's a gamble, how lucky do you feel...

I also have a Monaco card on order, cant wait till they have their Europe release.

Bought my first £50 at the end of September and it's risen by 131%. Will yours do the same, who knows. You value your money differently to everyone else. If you are comfortable potentially loosing it and believe in bitcoin and blockchain then absolutely you should. 
If you do want to I would say hold off for a few days as it will probably slump a little as it try's to break the resistance of the $10k mark. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:52:52
That's gambling and only you can make that decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:08:44
I would. be surprised if we saw a dip of more than $500 unless there was a significant outside influence. I would expect BTC to start bouncing back slowly but constantly and surpass the 10K mark again within two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:04:01
I think you worrying about it too much, how does it make a difference?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:59:14
Would have, could have...didn't. No point dwelling on it.

Can we all make sure we say Diet Coca-Cola and not just Diet Coke please. 
There are so many more important things to get upset about these days. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:52:30
I know exactly what you mean, the way I see it is why would BTC be worth anything if you don't use it to buy things. I have ordered a prepaid card with the goal of actually using BTC as a day to day currency. Partly because I think it's an important factor for general adoption but also all that coffee money transferred to BTC for the month will hopefully also gain value until I spend it giving me more value. That last coffee of the month will hopefully be very cheap. 
I'm still going to hodl for the gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:45:08
As per your post title would it make any difference if a sub Reddit for MacDonald's called it Diet Coke? No it wouldn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:18:40
Ahh classic "your worrying about it too". Whatever, I have nothing to worry about as I haven't bought any shady bcash. 
But honestly why do BTH get so upset about the name?
