This is a healthy correction 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:07
Go ahead and send me your BTC...I'll gladly HODL them for you lol 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:06:27
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:03:14
XRP 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:17
This has been true but will eventually change.  There are far superior coins than BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:27
Ahh well that makes sense...LOL....I bought in at $8K..doubled my money...took out my initial investment and now I'm having fun watching the rest freak the fuck out LOL!
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:52:20
Thank you for sharing.  You make excellent points.  I guess that’s what concerns me most.  When you spend $15,000 USD on a bitcoin, you are praying even perhaps gambling that someone else will pay more than you did for it.  You are also hoping/gambling that another crypto doesn’t become more popular.  Scary shit if you ask me.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:40
Trezor works well. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:10:15
What sort of question is that?  When I see opportunity is seize it.  What have you done for crypto beside tell people to HODL? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:55
So I sold all my crypto today made a modest profit and will likely get back in at BTC&lt;$10k LTC&lt;$150.  Good luck to all!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:25
yep! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:17:13
Smart move
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:24:00
It’s a game...you need to understand that BTC is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  I knew when it blasted past $10k and settled at $19k it was a bubble.  I think the pain may just now start to begin.  Fair market value in my opinion is $8.5k per BTC.  Good luck to all!

good bye troll

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:13
People are reassessing what holds value
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:51:29
Will hit $450 in the next 30 days
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:02:37
Just loaded up on some BTC.  I couldn't resist at below $14K!  LOL Holding BTC, XRP, LTC &amp; XVG 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:39:01
Nope I’m taking my profits and investing in the oil patch :).  Need to generate energy to sell to miners lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:05
LTC is really funny...it hovers for while then spikes.  Buying at $300 is safe for a long term investor. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:18:55
It is never wise to violate the pig theory...pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered...I'm financially comfortable I don't need 100K BTC or even 1MM BTC to be happy...Cheers!
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:12:59
Ok you have just proved that you are a moron.  Bitcoin will never be an everyday currency...its a store of value.  It will be used to buy homes cars and settle large amounts of debt not to go buy a cup of coffee. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:14:03
Go to bed it will be lower over the next few days
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:54:03
One more note....people who hold bitcoin encourage others to do the same...that shit is so annoying IMO
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:17:21
I strongly recommended XRP when it was below a dollar.  I think that a good entry point would be $1.50.  Wait for it to come down a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:32:25
I know this is a Bitcoin forum but does anyone have an opinion on Litecoin they’d like to share?  I’ve dabbled with bitcoin and was wiledly successful with the gamble selling almost at the peak.  I’ve since withdrew my funds and am interested in purchasing litecoin.  It’s fundamentally the same as bitcoin with a higher coin cap.  It’s faster to transact with and is cheaper too?  Why does it seem undervalued? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:29:19
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:55:25
Should have taken my advice....
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:03
Bad idea...if you want to invest your money in a safe haven invest in gold or silver
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:39
Yes you are correct 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:30:13
shit you're right! What are we doing here?!?!? lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:28:56
Nope not worried at all...I’m in it for the long haul 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:15:07
i remember being blown away when BTC broke 13k...this isn't crashing...this is normal BTC activity 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:32:28
Buying anything &lt;$15k
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:37:11
10K and 8K are more significant milestones.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:32:48
It will go below 10k maybe not in 12 hours but within the next 365 days.  Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:16:04
Faster cheaper paperless transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:49:35
I’m well aware.  I’m focused on natural gas and oil production.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:31
Don't care I'll be dead ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:14:05
Thanks Vet Good Luck!

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:15:14
It’s amazing to se people loosing their sit over a minor correction.  I’m fully prepared to see bitcoin dropping to $8k.  It’s healthy to break the parabolic trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:35:59
sorry man LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:00:44
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:32:38
Is anybody concerned about how rapidly this thing has accelerated?  FOMO works both ways right?  I mean you can’t really buy anything with bitcoin and it’s super expensive to move around.  Curious about everyone’s thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:08:33
I also own a diversified portfolio of various stocks...is that ok or is that shunned upon too? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:18:35
if you only knew what my situation is....that literally made me LOL  
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:59:52
Wise move 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:24:20
Yes, I noticed the head and shoulders pattern (its pretty obvious).  Frankly the price correction we are seeing is a healthy break from the parabolic trend.  We should see BTC stabilize soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:09
This is the problem with this coin.  People speculate and want to get rich over night.  Understand BTC for what it is...it’s purpose os to not make you rich.  It is to put banking in the hands of the average joe.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:20:40
I believe in making not loosing money.  Cheers! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:06
Yep 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:16:21
I recommended XRP in this forum yesterday and am invested heavily in it.  I think that it provides comfort that it is run by a company.  They are incentivized to see it continue to grow.  As far as a digital currency it is far superior to any of the top cryptos (LTC,BTC,ETH).  Faster and cheaper to move around.  So what if it is centralized!?  The creator of BTC is said to have around 1MM BTC so what is the difference.  Well I'll tell you what the difference is.  Ripple XRP has an executive management team that is working like hell to provide the best crypto services in the world.  What is Satoshi up to??????
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:30:45
Just curious what everyone's thoughts are on LTC...if you must know I'm 35 years old I own an oil and gas company.  I'm married to a doctor and I live in a $800k home.  Go fuck yourself! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:08:29
Try Binance.  Recommend XVG.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:11:41
Better chance of seeing $2,850k sorry but true...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:55:34
nice analogy but the blood has not even begun to be shed.  wait for sub $10K to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:20:55
If you met my wife you'd understand ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:21
That would be a very reasonable price given the amount of hype bitcoin went through this year
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:30:21
That’s because you’re not short sighted and understand that this asset class is volitile. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:21:07
For the record I HATE fox news! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:21:11
You sir are a moron 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:08:27
Please tell me you're joking....why the hell would you do that???
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:27:03
I enjoy making money.  Sold BTC at 18k.  Go ahead and HODL lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:45:07
Blood in the streets...literally bodies on the pavement 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:50:35
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:10:39
I'm very grateful for the opportunity to make a ton of money with bitcoin but it really feels like a Ponzi scheme to me.  My wife was sick of me talking about it.  So I sold everything I had and have no regrets.  I got in at 7K and purchase quite a bit.  It was crazy seeing my money multiply overnight.  However, all good things must come to an end.  I think there is a chance Bitcoin will be below 7K in the next two months.  Patience is key and there are only two rules 1. don't loose money 2. don't forget rule number 1.  Good luck to all the Hodlers out there see you guys when/if I get back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:36:22
Is anybody concerned about how rapidly this thing has accelerated? FOMO works both ways right? I mean you can’t really buy anything with bitcoin and it’s super expensive to move around.  I was told that Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi scheme but more of a “who’s the greater fool?” scenario.... Curious about everyone’s thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:40
Wow you have an amazing point about Coinbase’s questionable liquidity.  Literally everyone would be totally screwed!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:26:48
you have plenty of time to throw away your money...I expect BTC to be below $10K by end of year.  This is a reasonable expectation/
