if only, 10 btc now mostly unattainable for most people
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:40:27
My god this would give me a heart attack..
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:42:47
He does actually, you realise there is more than one ETF right? BK is the man
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:47:56
I bought in 2012

@_date: 2018-08-20 13:09:13
How is sentiment positive? Sounds like you’re drawing your conclusions based on a few permabull reddit comments 
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:26:29
depends if it breaks it
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:58:25
Speak for yourself, Long time In the game and I would spend it
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:52:41
Forget ETF, this is the type of development I’ve been waiting for
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:28:38
none of them have the same level of decentralization 
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:23:39
“worthy of it” fuck u talking about 
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:42:19
market was tiny in 2014 and most people lost interest during that year due to the immense amount of fud
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:17:48
eat my shorts
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:30:36
You must be new here
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:22:00
cringe at 'le' in the comments, it was a simpler time

hero's don't always wear capes
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:33:58
Well yeah but the dream of owning 5-10 btc is kinda unattainable for most people these days
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:59:50
Average joe will buy when the price starts going up again 
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:02:08
Just short it. It’s easy. Free money
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:55:10
sounds like someone opened a short ;)
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:57:59
good to see someone thinking straight, the bear market has gotten to peoples heads 
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:18:15
cointracking will allow you to import all your trades from exchanges
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:25:06
we get it, you're a bear

@_date: 2018-06-23 02:47:20
ponzi scheme posts = buy signal
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:43:48
you say that now, but during bear market people want to get rid of their bags, it's always the opposite during a bull market, you'll wish you had more BTC and find it difficult to sell
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:04:19
You are being a tad hyperbolic, try to relax, perhaps take some time away from crypto..
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:37:35
99% of regular folk are not in bitcoin and have zero interest at this time. You’re basing this verdict off a few YouTubers, weirdos on this sub, tone vays &amp; Craig wright
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:00:43
yup &amp; i can see gold breaking 10T in next 2 years
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:10:47
@_date: 2019-02-17 11:23:22
Extremely high.. of course the question is what alts will survive?
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:41:20
this is good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:58:26
Stop listening to tone vays 
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:19:24
Holy shit if this happens 
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:33:26
Seems a tad too early imo, though we could be at beginnings of a slow rise with some action toward end of year 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:37
It's fascinating. Posts of $10k imminent last week now people claiming the party is over... been like this since 2012
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:04:34
that's a marge
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:52:17
5-10 BTC to retire comfortably
@_date: 2019-06-10 08:53:24
yeah i think those with 10btc+ are truely on this train for potential early retirement etc, people allocating just 1BTC as their early retirement fund might be waiting a while..
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:07:26
Be careful, most people are doing this and thinking very much in the moment / short term
@_date: 2019-04-17 03:41:12
imo the drop from 6k was unwarranted (hash war nonsense) and now we are retracing
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:09:31
looking forward to the vegeta memes towards end of year
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:50:45
Meh 2 trillion ain’t that much.. still a whole lot smaller than gold. Apple alone hit the 1T mark and that’s just one company..
@_date: 2019-04-30 03:02:36
which is still a shitload
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:38:07
Lots of desperate people in here wanting sub 3k
@_date: 2019-04-16 21:57:21
It has a market cap of 7.5 Trillion .. .
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:55:09
More people are buying, less people are selling 
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:00:33
Excellent down with Chinese mining centralisation
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:39:51
continue the dump
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:54:33
continue the dump
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:28:46
USA leading the way
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:08:02
a good day in crypto land
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:34:18
This, apparently I was a fool for not selling at $1300
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:52:09
everyone should have the goal of owning at least 1 BTC while they can, when this turns bullish everyone will once again realise that there is barely any supply
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:13:16
Think he means 7 figures 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:10:38
Many will wish they did once it’s at 50k
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:44:56
Cool to see some alts on there already 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:18:32
Bitcoin is not for you
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:27:03
big if true
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:07:46
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:17:45
Looking forward to using this, BTC privacy no longer a pipe dream
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:32:37
does this matter? stratis team make products for BTC as well
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:44:19
sounds pretty cool.. still a tad confused as to whether RSK will have it's own token per se, i'm assuming that is SBTC? Asking for a friend (me) who wants to buy a whole lot as early as possible
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:00:03
Hmm we have not had the weekend dip last weeks
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:08:51
Good. Pray that btc tests 6.5k again during that time
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:54:11
Stop arrogantly acting like you know what’s going to happen, so many of these posts now that the price is low 
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:29:52
Rookie 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:32:20
hmm reading some calls for double bottom being confirmed, possible end of bear market, we'll see
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:24:15
I'm confused, sounds like you're expecting the trend to continue?
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:57:43
Could be right. Many are calling 11k being the key indicator of bull market truely being back.

@_date: 2018-12-14 06:51:54
Lol average joe don’t give a fuck if it’s adopted, average joe buys if price is going up
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:18:38
That could well be worth millions in coming years, I would not have sold it all ..
