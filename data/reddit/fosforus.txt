Yes, I bet the big exchanges regularly do many millions of dollars a day in withdrawals and deposits. GDAX did $215,000,000 in trading volume of BTC/USD in the last 24 hours. Even if new deposits and withdrawals are only a tiny fraction of that, it's still a lot of money.

if you zoom in (using bar at the top - like 24hr view or so) you can see what fee level is getting "chomped" with each new block; right now it looks like it's mostly 200+ sat/b, and a little bit of 140+ sat/b.
miners can choose any valid transactions they want, but its generally a safe assumption that they'll select for the highest fees.

In a blockchain system, that's how it works. The max right now is about 7 transactions per second, and this stays constant regardless of how many users, nodes, and miners are active. The only thing that will change the throughput is new scaling tech like Segwit and lightning.

It is a very interesting case study in human psychology and online communities, that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:10:27
Yes, and developers are already working on multiple scaling solutions.
It's not all about the developers, though. Bitcoin is a human network as much as it is a computer network. Think of the public outcry against Coinbase as a sort of immune response, or a "village trial" in which a bad actor is called out for irresponsible use of a shared resource. 
This sort of community response is vital to Bitcoin's future, because we're going to face an increasingly complex set of challenges, many of which won't be solvable by technology alone.

TBH, I don't think the network needs more full nodes, unless you will be using your node to post lots of your own transactions.
I think the best thing you can do is LEARN as much as you can, and then spend time here and any other discussion sites or meetups etc, helping to welcome newcomers, answer questions, dispel myths and FUD, etc. In other words, become part of Bitcoin's immune system, because we're gonna need all the help we can get :)
If you help just one newcomer feel good about joining the community, that's a huge win. Bitcoin's value is based on the number of people who understand it and believe in it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:56:26
Think of bitcoin as physical gold - if you want to transfer it to someone else, it will take time and money to "ship" it to them. Once upon a time, on-chain bitcoin transfers were very fast and very cheap, but as it grows in popularity we're seeing a bottleneck because blockchain space is limited. So fees and confirmation time are getting more onerous.
Now think of Lightning as legal claim certificates for that underlying gold. It's much, much quicker and cheaper to swap these certificates around. Every certificate is digitally signed by the owners of the underlying asset. But now, instead of paying and waiting to ship Alice some of your physical gold, you and Alice can just update a certificate that says "Of the 2 bitcoin in this channel, 1.5 belongs to Bob, and 0.5 belongs to Alice." Boom, done. 
These certificates can be redeemed on the actual blockchain at any time. Think of the blockchain as the supreme court - they will enforce the legality of your certificate, and make sure you can collect on your property. So whenever you want your real gold, you can get it. But if you are happy with just using the certificates, you can conduct pretty much all your business without ever "going to court."
EDIT: Hopefully this analogy also illustrates the importance of multi-layered scaling. Those who want to scale the bitcoin blockchain itself to handle all transactions are kind of saying "I want the global supreme court to sign off on each and every coffee purchase I make."

@_date: 2018-01-20 16:31:04
Yeah, I'm wondering what attack vectors might exist.
Are messages on LN end-to-end encrypted? I'm wondering if a mischievous node could publish all channels to the blockchain, and thus force them to be closed. Which would be annoying, though not really a "hack."
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:31:34
I believe that decentralization IS security, against corrupt/incompetent leadership.
What altcoins do you see as the most decentralized - i.e. where there is no small group of founders/owners who could decide to make a large change to the protocol and no one would really be able to stop them?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:12:39
Or not.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:37:57
Bitcoin uses electricity for security. It pays miners to make sure that attacks on the network are not feasible. With a current inflation rate of 4%, that means that in effect, 4% of Bitcoins total market value will be spent on electricity. 
That's a lot of electricity, but look at it through a different lens: what do you think is a reasonable overhead cost for securing a first-of-its-kind decentralized global currency with potentially huge social, economic, and political power? I think 4% is pretty efficient. How much do you think is spent securing the sovereignty of the U.S. dollar? Do most governments and banks run with 96% efficiency? I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:46:53
Look up "child pays for parent"; I think it works exactly how you want. Assuming that the fee on the child transaction is high enough to really be attractive to miners right now. Sounds like your "average" fee is 130 sat/b which might not be high enough.
Maybe do a "grandchild" tx and pay even more? Hope you get it sorted out!
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:23:16
yeah, if you sent to an exchange address then you have fewer options. You might be able to use a bitcoin accelerator - I am less familiar with those but I think it's basically an off-chain agreement with a mining pool, e.g. "hey [mining pool], I will pay you a bonus of [x] in cash if you include my transaction in the next block that you mine." One more thing for you to try googling :)
Or if you have the option to just wait it out, there's a good chance that the tx will process naturally within the next week. 138 sat/byte is decently high, and the mempool has dipped below that multiple times recently.

Proof of stake has other serious issues. See for example 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:09:46
double-spending is definitely a core consideration of the design. i know it's controlled for; i'm not sure i can explain how it fully works. 
I do know that if multiple lightning networks existed, you would not be able to put the same bitcoin onto more than one at a time. it needs to be "committed" to a certain network/channel in order for you to spend it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:31:48
Yeah, confirmation can have various meanings here.
1. Coinsource "confirming" in some proprietary sense that they have received payment, and transmitted the BTC transaction to the network.
2. The transaction is included in a new block by a miner. Note that depending on fee level etc, there could be a big delay before this occurs. But once it does, congratulations, the transaction is now "confirmed." Well, kind of. Specifically we'd say "it has 1 confirmation."
3. Several subsequent blocks get added to the chain. Each of these is like a further vote of confidence in all blocks that have come before, including the one with your transaction, so we count each block as another "confirmation." A generally accepted rule is that when you have 6 confirmations, that's when your transaction is really "confirmed" and irreversible. But this is just semantic; depending on the service you use it might have a different threshold for calling the transaction "confirmed."
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:59:34
It's a feature, not a bug. Proof of Work remains the best decentralized security mechanism available. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:55:20
The block "speed limit" is to control the accumulative size of the blockchain, and to add resistance to some type of attacks. It is not to control the rate of inflation.

Yes, by importing your private keys into a wallet that supports the fork. It's highly recommended to move your BTC to a different wallet before doing so. Have to be very careful overall. Also not sure what December Segwit fork you are referring to... There have been a few shady forks that don't even have a working wallet app or a live blockchain. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are the only fork coins I've been able to claim.

It's good, thoughtful journalism. Take the time to read it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:30:32
im having a bit of trouble following your language, but one thing to clarify: multi-hop transactions will be the norm on LN.
So, if Bob wants to send payment to Alice, he probably won't have a direct channel with Alice. Bob has a channel with Starbucks, which has a channel with many other big nodes, one of which has a channel open directly with Alice. Bob's payment to Alice will hop along those connections.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:11:00
opening a channel is a regular blockchain transaction. same for closing a channel - you broadcast the "final state" of the channel, and then it gets sealed into the blockchain record. it won't include a full history of all the back-and-forth that happened on the channel; maybe lightning nodes maintain such records much I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:03:39
yeah, the original implementation had some real bugs, like the off-by-one error with OP_CHECKMULTISIG.

At this stage of Bitcoin's development, it's really a "tragedy of the commons" situation. If the Bitcoin community were a village of shepherds, Coinbase would be the lazy shepherd who mismanages his sheep and lets them gobble up an unfairly large portion of the shared grass.
So what happens? Social accountability happens. The community finds and calls out the bad actor. Sure, there could be better architecture and systems in place, to make this misuse impossible. Over time I'm sure there will be lots of improvements. But these are early days, and the network infrastructure *is* limited, so it's particularly important for the community to be vigilant and responsive. And that's what is happening.

yeah, this is an increasingly important question. Over time I think we'll see some new "best practices" and security options emerge. All the security would need to be trustless in order to keep with Bitcoin's core ethos. One thing I was thinking about was time-lock safes, or time-lock smart contracts, as a way to additionally harden cold storage. Like, there is a mandatory 7 day waiting period between when you access the cold storage funds, and when you can make an outgoing transfer. This waiting period can be cancelled or reset by you at any time. This would still have some problems, but maybe it's a step in the right direction?

Most of mining revenue comes from inflation, i.e. the new coins issued with each block. The inflation rate is 4% right now. So yes bitcoin holders "pay" for that in the sense that the value of their coins has been slightly diluted.  Why do we pay for this? For security! Think of it this way: we pay a 4% per year fee to miners to make sure that the network stays secure against attacks. This % remains the same regardless of the price of a bitcoin.
And it's very important to keep in mind that this inflation rate drops by half every four years. That's why Bitcoin is ultimately deflationary.
And yes, large miners must have some way of cashing out large amounts of BTC. They probably have a wider range of options than just the exchanges that retail investors use; Gemini for example has an auction service and an "institutional" account option.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:40:14
Hmm... but again, Bitcoin is an example of an open protocol that was NOT designed in a committee with banks or anything of that nature. And yes it still has a long way to go before maturity, but it is making impressive headway, despite lots of bankers wanting it to go away. I'm hopeful that it'll continue to make progress, and that we'll see other clever protocols that can similarly bootstrap up to being a serious challenger to entrenched businesses.

yep. for Bitcoin specifically, a valid block must have a hash value that happens to start with a lot of zeros. the more zeros required, the higher the difficulty.
recent block hash values:
* 0000000000000000000f16e008f5e2810f7aadd268d71f1dd5b23d4df51ef3d7
* 00000000000000000055c8b06ef4537248819119ea5af32b1c02b17212cb027b
* 000000000000000000142b299c40885463b35d4887b81c2cb5012d6445becb56
miners have to experiment with millions of different block compositions in order to find one that hashes to such a value. the simplest way to iterate through possibilities is to change the nonce value, which is basically just a random extra value for this purpose, but they can also change the set of included transactions, or any of the other parameters that influence the hash result.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:07:12

But if mining is changed so that it yields some additional value (such as machine learning or protein folding) beyond just the BTC block reward, the amount of mining will simply go up.

Bitcoin mining is a competitive market that constantly self-balances against the retail price of bitcoin. If the price goes down, some miners will stop, but that increases the reward for all the miners that are still going - so that's why we'd never have a situation where ALL miners stop.
Also, mining is not primarily about transaction processing - it's primarily about network security. Your transaction could be processed for a tiny amount of electricity - but Bitcoin is designed to "burn" a lot of power in order to keep the network honest. It's too complex to be explained in a few sentences, but it's a very clever and new design.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:20:49
Because it's the wrong way to solve the problem, in the same way that adding a lane to a freeway often doesn't help traffic. The tradeoffs are too great, and if we were to go to 2mb, very soon people would be asking about 4mb, and then 8mb, because Bitcoin is growing in popularity really fast. I think it's very prudent of the core devs to avoid that slippery slope entirely and look towards more powerful scaling solutions.

Not sure if I follow your point about walled gardens. In something like a Transit protocol, there is no company that can choose to wall it off.

there will always be an advantage for larger operations that can negotiate discounts on their hardware and electricity costs.
you mention "the hope of hitting the 'big time reward'" - are you aware of mining pools? Pretty much all small miners join a cooperative pool so that they can get an average payout, rather than hoping to win the lottery by someday mining a block on their own.

No, the worst that could happen is that you are unable to complete the new LN transaction, so your channel stays in its previous state. And that would only happen if the whole network comes apart and no paths can be found from you to the recipient.
Devs have been working on this for years, and there are now large groups of people testing for any possible bugs. It's carefully designed tech.

ok, but that's kind of a conspiracy theory way of looking at things.

Well, kind of... but difficulty adjustments only happen every 2016 blocks. So if almost all miners went offline at the same time, it could take an eternity for the "survivors" to publish enough blocks at the current difficulty in order to reach the next adjustment. 
If something like this actually happened (which I see as very unlikely), I think the most likely fix would be a hard fork to make an emergency difficulty adjustmet so the network could get back on its feet. But this fork might be contentious.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:53:24
No. The design is one block per ten minutes, regardless of the # of miners. and that's how it will stay, most likely.
As inflation tapers off, that does reduce the incentive to mine. The number of miners will naturally adjust to those market conditions - it's just an equation of supply and demand and profit margins. As the supply of mining changes, the difficulty also auto-adjusts, to keep the block time at 10 minutes.

Just because bitcoins move around in a different way than other assets doesn't mean that police are powerless. For example, there was a thread today about someone whose coins were stolen by an eBay scammer. If the scammer is caught and still has the coins, they may be ordered by a court to return them.
Sure, no government has direct power to intervene on the blockchain, but "give us the private keys or you're going to jail" can be pretty persuasive...

Realistically, no. The only possible way to mine bitcoin profitably is to spent a couple grand on an ASIC, because the market is so competitive.
Some other coins like Ethereum can still be profitably mined with a GPU. Not sure if a raspberry pi can profitably mine anything.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:26:19

for example, AirBnb and Uber and eBay create "marketplaces" for p2p transactions, but at the center is a for-profit company that has a lot of control, and takes a hefty slice of each transaction.
I can imagine open-source smart contract protocols that provide an equivalent service, but with order-of-magnitude smaller fees, and no centralized control. 
The main values that these marketplace companies provide are connecting peers, and providing trust. i.e. Uber says "here's a nearby driver for you, and we say that he is trustworthy." eventually, trustless networks will be able to do an equivalent thing - i.e. "here's a nearby driver, and they have 100 blockchain-verifiable customer reviews, and they have X as collateral in case of fault, etc etc."
I'm mostly just spitballing, but I do think that some version of this will come to pass, and maybe faster than we expect.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:34:55
Bitcoin is an experiment in decentralized, trustless consensus. I encourage you to keep learning about it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:27:27
Yes, good perspective. The need for authority and trust is really deeply rooted; it's fascinating to watch as we struggle to uproot it bit by bit.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:40:07
That's fair. There is certainly a wide range of sentiment out there. 
I think that anyone who bought in just recently, and/or is in the red with their investment, is more likely to be fearful in their thinking. The longer they hodl (according to my experience), the more the fear will subside and be replaced by patience and confidence.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:52:11
Generally there is no expiration date on transactions. They could keep getting rebroadcasted indefinitely. Fortunately we have replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent as options to accelerate the stuck transaction.

Can you explain more?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:09:43
Any respectable exchange's top priority is the secure custody of customer funds. There's a good chance that they are now growing so fast that they are literally "bursting at the seams," i.e. the engineering teams are spending all their time just trying to keep the site up and running, and security could suffer as a result. So they are putting new signups on pause until they can shore up the foundations, so to speak.
Just a guess, but I've worked in software for a while and I can easily imagine it playing out this way.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:38:39
Also keep in mind that mining hardware needs to be replaced pretty regularly. Because of increased competition, but also because the chips are working so hard that they might only survive for a year or two before fizzling.

can't speak for the OP, but from my perspective, BTC doesn't have to "take over" fiat. It just has to become more widely accepted, to the point that you can use it for most purchases, and therefore never need to think about converting it back to fiat.

@_date: 2018-01-17 06:49:10
It's not waste though; it's an intentional part of the security model. It needs to be expensive to produce blocks, otherwise a lot of attack vectors would open up.
Bitcoin is a global value store and transaction network; it needs to have good security. Think about Fort Knox: are the guards patrolling there every day a "waste"?
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:09:59
I'm saying that being able to change USD into BTC and back *is* utility if one kind. But that's just a semantic challenge to your contrasting of utility vs. investment. And yeah right now I would guess that this use case represents the majority of blockchain activity. One we really have Lightning, I think a lot of new use cases will start to take off, which will be pretty exciting
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:24:53
true, that's a better example. thanks for helping me play with a new analogy :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:37:03
I wouldn't say "cripple." I would say it's applying more evolutionary pressure. Bitcoin will absolutely find a way past this.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:42:19
Is there really a difference? "I'm buying a coffee with some Bitcoin" or "I'm buying USD with some Bitcoin." 
Right now, Bitcoin's primary utility seems to be as a global value store or reserve currency, so, when it is exchanged with fiat currency I think that is adoption of a very real sort. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:16:42

Yes, existing companies would be resistant to participating - that's what your XML example showed, right?
But the whole idea is that these new protocols *don't need* participation from such companies. E.g. Bitcoin does not need any participation from banks. Banks can choose to see it as a competitor, or they could choose to jump in and participate somehow. But either way, the protocol stands on its own. That's how it's different from the XML example, which could not succeed without willing participation from existing players.
Though I'll agree that the author may have been overexcited to claim that businesses would jump on to the bandwagon. But it's fine if they don't.

All of this is complicated, but I wouldn't lose sleep over it - your coins are safe and you'll figure out how to get them off the exchange soon enough.
To answer the first question: yes, an exchange could switch you from non-Segwit to Segwit on the fly, because exchanges are not the same as wallets. The exchange has an internal proprietary database tracking your balances, and they can easily generate additional deposit addresses for you to use. So it sounds like they now support Segwit, and gave you a Segwit deposit address. Any coins sent to this address will be credited to your account in the exchange's internal database. Any withdrawals you make from the exchange might not come from the same addresses that you deposited to; they could come from any address that the exchange controls.
Hope that helps a bit. I don't know enough about Segwit to answer your other questions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:33:15

The difficulty adjustment algorithm behind PoW is a pretty new concept. In most production/mining scenarios, increased effort means an increase in supply. So it's natural that, if the journalist doesn't understand the nuances of PoW, they will assume that all this cryptojacking will lead to a supply increase.

I appreciate your perspective, and I'm curious about how best to handle this debate. Personally, I believe PoW really is the best way, and I don't see the energy expenditure as a "waste." But I recognize that many people do see it that way, including people who, like me, share a big concern about climate change and the role our energy industry plays in it.
I believe that Bitcoin, including its PoW and energy demands, is a very good thing in the world, even considering the issue of climate change. I am not sure of the best arguments to offer in support of that. I think the author of this article offered some good ones, but clearly you were not convinced. It's a challenging topic. I hope to keep exploring it.
@_date: 2018-09-27 00:53:07
basically all nodes and miners. miners will almost certainly check all signatures before including in a block, because if they include anything invalid, their block will be rejected by most other nodes on the network, since those nodes will re-verify any candidate block that miners publish.

Bitcoin does not dream. Bitcoin is a very simple lifeform that feeds on energy and provides a mostly-immutable ledger in return. It does not much care about whatever use cases its human symbionts find for it :)
But to actually answer your question, yes, if Bitcoin reaches the "unit of account" stage of monetary adoption, then it will become normal to see goods priced in Bitcoin, or Satoshis for smaller stuff.

You sound conflicted. My response is, don't sell within a year, period. Not just to avoid the short term gains tax, but also to build up a tolerance for the volatility. If you are constantly watching the price and trying to think about selling, you'll make yourself crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:48:24
It sounds like you're asking for conflicting things. Do you want to "spend the full balance," or do you want to "leave the 9 satoshis alone"? 
If you create a transaction for exactly 50 mBTC, there's a good chance the wallet's behavior will be to use the single 50 mBTC input and skip the dust. But if you literally try to move 50.0009 mBTC, of course the wallet would have to include the dust as well.

1. Bitcoin mining rigs can only perform SHA256 hashes. So, alternative use cases are limited. They do give off lots of heat, so you can use them as noisy heaters :)
2. Yes, Bitcoin is much more than payment processing. It is also a very important store of value, a monetary unit not controlled by any government. The Bitcoin network is also the first working proof of decentralized cooperation and consensus among adversarial parties, aka Nakamoto Consensus. This could have many implications over time.
3. You can include small amounts of arbitrary data in every transaction and block. For example, miners can "sign their name" on a block they create, and/or include a brief political statement such as "NO2X". Something else you can do is include a hash of something, for example the hash of a statement or contact. This hash can then be referenced later as proof that the given statement/contract existed at the time it was included in a block.

If a single party controls ALL access, then decentralization would be pretty much lost. But that would be nearly impossible for any control-seeking party to achieve. It's likely that we'll continue to have a wide variety of inroads to the Bitcoin network, some much more regulated and controlled than others.

A vulnerability, not a memory issue. A miner could publish a block with an invalid transaction (which spends the same input twice) and it would cause nodes to crash. The block would not be accepted into the chain, but it would cause node downtime.
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:15:51
it's usually via the banks. the gov't can order the banks around, and tell them not to process any transfers to/from crypto exchanges. so that removes the main onramp/offramp between fiat and crypto. people who already have crypto can still use it, and P2P sales can happen, but its harder for the system to grow overall.
@_date: 2018-09-15 03:13:03
Bitcoin mining machines can only do SHA256 hashes. That's the whole idea of an ASIC: an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. All of the circuit boards are custom built to perform SHA256 hashing, and they are useless for all else.
From one perspective, this is a good thing. Anyone who has made a capital investment into Bitcoin mining knows that if Bitcoin somehow dies, their hardware will be useless. So, they have an additional incentive to keep the network healthy and valuable.
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:01:20
Actually they're kind of similar. It's a question of how many people believe. Belief is what makes it real.

If the transaction is signed and valid, anyone could broadcast it to the network and it will get processed. So in that sense they could "move your BTC," but not to an address of their choosing. The destination address will be whatever you chose when you made the transaction in the first place.

I hope so. I guess my deepest worry is that some Wall St actors know that Bitcoin threatens their business model, and therefore they might accelerate the deployment of various dirty tricks to try and stop/neuter/dilute it.

If it has 755 confirmations when you check in a block explorer - then your wallet must be simply out of sync. It has happened to me with Electrum. But one way or another, this is a specific wallet issue, not a blockchain issue.

waiting for BTC confirmations on a coffee purchase is kind of like checking quarters and dimes to see if they're counterfeit. Who would bother with forging a transaction of such a small amount?  Merchants will just see that the tx has been posted to the network, and that's good enough. No one is going to bother with an elaborate double-spend scheme or 51% attack for a coffee purchase.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:52:41
I think the biggest attack surface is the social one. Convince more and more people that Bitcoin wastes energy, and is used by drug dealers and 3rd world regimes, and contributes nothing to society, etc. 
Bitcoin dies if everyone stops believing in it. And even die-hard hodlers might eventually get tired of trying to defend their beliefs, if they find themselves vastly outnumbered by doubters.

I guess I see PoW as the best possible answer to the question, "what is unforgeably costly?" The essence of what makes things hard, or valuable, is the expenditure of energy. So, tying the monetary system directly to the expenditure of energy is purest, most essential thing we can do. I read one [article]( that said "all proposed PoW-alternatives could be relabeled 'obscured proof of work.'" By tying the system directly to energy, we aren't increasing costs per se, we are just removing layers of obscurity and complexity, and getting straight down to the essence.

It is not great at all. As soon as we start believing that Bitcoin is better held by trusted institutional custodians, we lose. These are institutions with a long history of fractional reserves, price and supply manipulation, rehypothecation, and any number of other shell games and tricks. Why should we believe that they'll be any more trustworthy or responsible this time around? We shouldn't. Their consistent failure is why Bitcoin came along in the first place.
Bitcoin is a monetary protocol with trustless, pseudonymous, publicly verfiable transactions. Bakkt's offering attempts to neuter this, or in their words, to "fix" Bitcoin's problems. And, regardless of whatever claims they make about maintaining 100% asset backing, why should we believe them? History shows again and again that any party who has the power to inflate the supply of an asset for their own benefit will eventually give in to the temptation.
So isn't it interesting, that the characteristics they propose to "fix" are the same characteristics that make Bitcoin unique, valuable, and threatening to the legacy financial system?
The scaling problem is temporary. Lightning and other major scaling improvements are coming along quickly. I, for one, would rather wait than hand over the reins to anyone on Wall St.

The price doesn't float - paper bitcoins will be sold for the same price as real ones. But the supply will be inflated, i.e. the institution may hold 100 BTC but sell paper shares for 200 BTC. more profit for them, and they can get away with it, until there is a run on the bank of course... and then after shit hits the fan, they can go ask for a  bailout. Lovely system, isn't it? :)

Yes you owe taxes. Crypto is just like any stock or commodity in this regard.
Any sale is taxable. Report a sale for $600, with a cost basis of $500, and pay tax on the difference.
The other half of your purchase hasn't been sold yet, so you don't have to report anything about that.

I've been pretty interested in this question. Here are my thoughts so far:
1. Gold's legitimate downsides are that it is hard to transport, and hard to easily subdivide. This is what led to the "convenience" incentive to adopt gold-backed certificates. And it's still true today; how would it work for us to carry gold everywhere and use it for large and small purchases? It'd be very awkward at best. I think a very good way to describe Bitcoin is "like gold, but quick and inexpensive to transfer in any quantity (and with a few other enhancements as well)."
2. The incentives for governments and banks are such that, over time, they have weaseled their way away from sound monetary standards, for their own advantage. In the process, over the last hundred years or more, they have implemented various mechanisms for neutering the power of gold. They have accumulated a large % of total available gold, and implemented all kinds of secondary markets (futures, derivatives, etc), and employed various other tricks, because a true gold standard restricts their power.
This formed a 1-2 punch. Gold's inconvenience made it easier to convince the public to move to gold-backed certificates, and since then, we've been on the slippery slope where governments and banks give themselves more and more power, and the currency is less and less tethered to anything real.
In a very real sense I think, governments and banks are now **addicted** to easy money, i.e. freely inflatable fiat currencies. Because of this addiction, the prospect of returning to any sound monetary standard like gold or Bitcoin is anathema to them. It's the medicine we need, but it's not exactly sweet on the palate :)

It depends on how you store it. I would say the best thing is to just write out a 1 page explanation, in language that you know will make sense to your spouse. Just talk through how to find your coins, take control of them, and sell them on an exchange if desired. I think if you write it yourself that will be more helpful that any online guide could be, and it'll be a good thought exercise for you too :)

This will eventually be true, but for the next several years while the inflation rate is relatively high, holding is quite sufficient.

In this context a fork usually means a blockchain fork, where some changes to the protocol are released and the nodes and miners on the network can individually choose whether to start running the new version.
In a hard fork, the changes are not backwards compatible, which means that a new version of the chain will "fork" off from the old one, and then you have two independent chains based on different protocols.

the book "The Bitcoin Standard" talks some about this. It suggests that trade would get a lot better, because there is no longer the uncertainty of exchange rates (which can change quickly due to politics). There are previous eras in history where this was the case due to a widely adopted gold standard, and trade blossomed during those times.
In addition to helping "conventional" trade, I think that BTC + LN opens up truly new avenues for trade. You can now send an instant, private, irreversible payment of sound money to anyone in the world for almost no fee, and no counterparty risk. We haven't even really gotten started in exploring what kinds of new possibilities that enables.

Most bitcoins are in cold storage, not for sale on exchanges. Trying to buy up all BTC would cause the price to go up massively, and so is pretty much the worst possible way to try to kill Bitcoin.

I hear what you're saying, but I do also think that TPS is still an important metric. It can make the difference between "this should confirm within 10 minutes" and "this should confirm within 4 hours, because the network is swamped today."
But I agree with your overall point that offchain solutions (like LN) are a much better route to supporting retail transactions at scale. And when some other project claims to be way more "advanced" or "efficient" than Bitcoin, I roll my eyes because every project faces the same set of trade-offs, and I think Bitcoin made the right choices in that department.

I really wonder about this - about whether the climbing hashrate is a strong bull signal or not. Maybe mining companies have high confidence about the future of BTC... but it could also be that they're locked in a game of chicken with each other, and nobody is winning anymore. 
Recently we learned that Bitmain's finances are an absolute mess. Their business strategy has been, to say the least, foolish. So could it be that it's just some very foolhardy miners trying to outcompete each other, creating essentially a hashrate bubble that could later collapse?

I think Bitcoin has a speculative value, and a fundamental/technical value. Hal was referring to the fundamental/technical value increasing over time. He is not saying that the speculative value, which is often much higher than the fundamental value, is justified, or that it cannot collapse.
In other words, every day our confidence in Bitcoin's technical reliability increases. That doesn't mean our confidence in the speculative price also needs to increase.

When referring to discrete units, the "s" makes sense - e.g. "he owes me 2 bitcoins." Similar to "two dollars." 
When the discrete unit doesn't matter, it sounds better w/o the "s": "he has more bitcoin than me." Similar to "more money."
In other words, it depends if you're using it as a mass noun or a count noun:

Well... for a ballpark you can just do 12.5 * .0119. or a more accurate number, you should use a block explorer and pull the exact total of transaction fees, in BTC, for as many blocks as you want to study.
Note that there is substantial fluctuation at times; in late December 2017 I think tx fees may have gotten as high as 50% of the total block reward.

each block must reference the previous block (by containing the hash of that block's header, or something like that), and in normal cases should have a later timestamp than the previous block, but whether it is 1 minute later or 1 week later doesn't matter as far as being a valid block.
a long blackout *would* result in a temporary difficulty reduction, i.e. the network would say "hmm, blocks are getting created more slowly than the ideal block-every-10-minutes schedule; let's reduce the difficulty."

It's an interesting question, and hard to see that far into the future. Perhaps on-chain transaction fees will be quite a higher at that point. I think as we have more options like LN for off-chain transactions, on-chain transactions start looking like the exception rather than the rule. In 2140, putting a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain might be akin to having your case tried by the world's securest, strictest court. That might be something that people are willing to pay for! As long as we know that the court is there to validate important transactions when we need it to, most business can be conducted off-chain.

The time from one block to the next is actually random, but with an average of 10 minutes. For two chains to keep growing in parallel, they would need to have near-identical block times over and over again, which is exceedingly unlikely.

funny thing is, if all other miners went offline, your profitability would not change at all, at least until the next difficulty adjustment, which only happens once every 2016 blocks.

No new blocks would get created if no one has electricity. Once the miners and the network can come back online, blocks will start getting created again. Online nodes will look at the new blocks and make sure they're valid before accepting them into the chain - it doesn't matter if there was a big delay since the previous block. 
So, such a blackout would really not be a problem. Bitcoin would be back to normal pretty much as quickly as the nodes and miners come back online.

It's a nice article but the depiction of blockchain is, as usual, problematic. Blockchain is not a revolutionary technology, and it is not immune to edits. Its resistance to edits is proportional to the size and decentralization of its network. In other words blockchain is a fairly boring, obscure data structure that forms one component of Bitcoin's revolutionary design. What makes BTC revolutionary is the arrangement of several kinds of technology, and several incentives, that together attract a very strong network effect and ensure security for all participants. No one piece (e.g. blockchain) offers much value on its own.

I believe that "Satoshi" is a pseudonym. The creator of Bitcoin is probably alive and well, and has no intention of claiming or reviving the Satoshi character.

You can send direct from Gemini to Bittrex (and vice versa). The exchange executes the transaction from one of their wallets, on your behalf.

We don't know that for sure. Personally I'm bullish, but lets be clear that Bitcoin is a high risk, very speculative asset. It has taken long, deep dives in the past and will likely have major downturns in the future as well.
Don't invest anything in Bitcoin you couldn't afford to lose!

If the US mint started issuing a new coin that was worth 1/10 of a penny, would that inflate the value of USD by 10x? Of course not. Adding more gradations of measurement does nothing to affect the volume.

I completely disagree; Bitcoin is still at an early stage of development. At this point it's much more of a collectible, speculative investment, or store of value. Using it as a medium of exchange for everyday purchases remains tricky because of volatility, limited infrastructure, etc. 
The merchants who do already accept BTC are early adopters and good sports. We certainly shouldn't fault them for anything. In general, we don't need more merchants that *accept* BTC, we need more people who actively *want* BTC. That's what drives demand, excitement, and progress. See [

Eh, they've done it before. I remember seeing a similar kind of Elliot wave analysis from Goldman Sachs a couple years ago. Turned out to be a fairly accurate prediction, I think.

I guess you could do that as a cautionary measure... but Gemini and Bittrex are both reputable exchanges. I've moved BTC between them many times and it has always worked perfectly.

It's not reasonable to assume that BTC supply will trend all the way down to 0. As the value grows, people will be more careful with it, and wallet and transfer interfaces will keep improving, making it less and less likely that people will permanently lose their coins.

Congrats and welcome!
The first thing to do with your Bitcoin is learn how to patiently sit on it :) there's quite a bit of risk in any lending platform, and cloud mining if generally considered to be a money-losing scam, so a lot of us here just hold onto our coins as tightly as possible. 
As far as participating in the community, here you are! Just take some time to read posts here, and maybe look back at top posts from the last few years to get a sense of the history. There is also a lot of Bitcoin community on Twitter; to get started I recommend following  as he publishes a great weekly summary thread every Sunday.

I totally hear your point. I do agree there is a lot of fanfare in this sub about getting rich. However, most bitcoin holders, and most active users on this sub (myself included), do not believe bitcoin is a scam. We believe it is a legit, exciting opportunity based on truly disruptive tech.
My challenge to you: find someone who has a clear, deep understanding of how Bitcoin works, AND believes it to be a scam.

Listen: the smart thing is to *stop trying to predict the market.* Just hold on. Don't sell. Don't watch the price too closely. Chances are, you'll get a better actual ROI by holding than you would by active trading.

maybe everyone will be able to trade it (though trading stablecoins is not very exciting), but to be a full partner and run a node, you need to pay $10 million. that's what coinbase and other big co's are doing. you can read the white paper: [
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:13:05
You could run a *node* with a raspberry pi, which helps propagate and validate new transactions and blocks on the network, but the only feasible way to *mine* BTC these days is with specialized ASIC machines that cost a couple grand each and eat a lot of electricity.
As far as wallet security - serious users will say that you should always control your own private keys, regardless of amount. Which is good advice, but when you're just getting started, I honestly think it's safer to trust an exchange (which has pretty decent security measures), until you have learned enough to really do it safely on your own.

It's the difference between "I am the only person in the world with the power to move these coins" and "I have an agreement with Coinbase Inc that some of the coins on their balance sheet belong to me, and I sure hope they would give them back if I asked."
Coinbase could:
* get hacked (Bitcoin itself has never been hacked, but exchanges have been hacked several times)
* pull an exit scam
* get seized or locked down by US government
* get tricked into giving your coins to someone who stole your identity
* decide what chain to follow after a hard fork, thus deciding what type of coins you have
* be closed for "wallet maintenance" at a time that you really wanted to make a transaction
* etc, etc, etc
In short, keeping your coins on an exchange makes it a lot more like traditional banking, and a lot less like the trustless, decentralized network it's designed to be.

Electrum seems way off too. It gives you a range of options, but after some back-of-the-envelope math I reduced the "low" fee by like 80%, and still got my tx confirmed quickly.
I think it's just hard to write a good algorithm, given all the variables involved. v0.15 of the core client has a new and improved algo, but maybe not everyone is using it, and/or maybe it still has flaws.

but much caution is advised about trying to move coins immediately after the fork. it's unpredictable how the two chains will interfere with each other, due to the absence of replay protection.

Gemini just pays it, invisibly. Which is nice of them. Their buy/sell fees are also on the low side; I imagine it's part of their business strategy since they are sort of an underdog to Coinbase/GDAX.

I've always understood "altcoins" to refer to "every cryptocurrency that isn't bitcoin (and maybe ether)," so yes.
A few that definitely did not start from Bitcoin codebase: Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, Bytecoin, probably lots of others. Haven't been able to find a place that keeps track of it all, though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:19:16
It makes sense. There will almost certainly be some serious volatility around the S2X fork, one way or another. Also, the supply is drying up - not many people are willing to lend out their BTC during the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:03:37
What do you want? Why are you in this sub?
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:27:26
I think, as the argument goes, it's not a serious problem because it would be pretty temporary. Mining is sort of a free market of supply and demand, and when you also factor in the dynamic difficulty adjustment behavior, you can see that BTC will be just fine. 
Large mining pools do have the power to _slow BTC down for a while_ - but only temporarily, and they definitely don't have the power to kill it or take it over. I think that's what luke-jr is saying, in his usual cryptic way :)

I believe it's perfectly legit. but here's are the downsides i can think of:
- you are trusting an exchange with your private keys
- while the coins are loaned out, you don't control them at all. have to wait for them to be returned should you want to move or sell them.
- you miss out on all forks/airdrops.
- its one more thing to keep track of, pay taxes on, etc
- it can be a pain to manage the lending; there are bots available to automatically re-lend your coins but it probably takes some fussing.
Personally, I don't do it right now because I don't want my coins on exchanges.

I don't expect a sudden wave of Wall Street money from this. These futures can be bought and sold without ever holding any actual BTC. Some investors might want to hold BTC, but they won't be buying all at once in huge volumes. They are professionals at entering (and manipulating) markets and they'll enter quietly. Some are already doing so, I'm sure.

Totally agree. The smart money is still on bitcoin; nothing happened this week to change that. The people selling bitcoin this week are susceptible to fear, BCH propaganda, and herd effects. 
I'd even go so far as to say this is good for bitcoin. As the weak hands sell, bitcoin comes to be concentrated in the hands of those who do their own research, think long-term, and are strongly resistant to FUD and propaganda. In that sense the network is getting smarter and harder over time.

Makes sense in the context of commodities that have a long production cycle - but how does that map on to Bitcoin?

If the fork gets really messy, if major governments somehow roll out very effective bans, if there is a sustained 51% attack, if major exchanges get hacked, if a severe vulnerability is discovered, if sentiment shifts towards some other crypto being "the one"... I don't think any of these are likely, but they are possible.
What is much more likely is a "healthy correction" of 10-30% after this steep bull run gets tired.

I agree 100%.


I mostly agree! But I think "wider acceptance" and "mostly-flat value" are conflicting right now, and will remain that way for a while. Transitioning into wider acceptance is going to continue to drive bitcoin's price way up. Lots of people are learning about it for the first time and wanting to buy in. I do hope that someday it's more like gold, where everyone more or less already knows about it as an option, and the price has stabilized.

Not even close, man. Investors understand that even if a large bunch of miners and nodes were running the S2X version, the original chain would keep going unaffected, except for maybe a dip in hashpower.
The fact that S2X nodes got stuck today means the threat to the main chain was *smaller* than we thought, not *larger*. The attack tripped on itself before it even began.

Yes - there are great ways to make your bitcoin highly secure.
But to a greater extent than before, the burden is really on the individual user to set up that security. And that's a big change, for people that are used to just handing over their wealth to Chase or Wells Fargo for safekeeping, and not really having to think about "account security" at all.

On Bitfinex at least, people may be re buying the BT2 futures so they can un-split and withdraw their BTC.
* Deposited BTC
* Split into BT1 and BT2
* Sell BT2 for BTC
* Price of BT2 crashes by 85% when fork is called off
* Now buy back BT2 at reduced rate, and un-split into BTC so the coins can be withdrawn

They seem legit, but they also take a flat 15% fee on all deposits, which seemed exorbitant enough to me that I didn't follow up further.

If you do get banned, it might be because you are swearing a lot and making inaccurate claims.


It doesn't sound like you understand the balancing mechanisms. If the price goes way down, then some miners might drop out, but that increases profitability for the miners that stick around, and furthermore, the difficulty level will auto-adjust to major changes in the mining "supply." It's a well-designed, self-balancing system.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:40:29
In the US at least, this is not correct. Based on everything I've read, all sales are taxable, even selling one crypto for another crypto on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:03:51
Bitcoin might be worse though. If you have money or gold in the bank, you can't just hand that over to kidnappers on the spot. But with bitcoin, depending on how you store it, maybe all they need is one password and then woosh, it's gone.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:57:59
I agree. If anything, I would say that custodial wallets are a kind of layer 2 solution. An imperfect one that loses some of BTC's value proposition, but nonetheless a lightweight settlement layer that makes BTC easier to adopt and use until the day that we have Lightning and all that cool stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:57:52
Very interesting. How does it work behind the scenes? I would guess they have an integration with one of the major exchanges... at least I hope they do. When there's no option to make a real blockchain transaction, how do you know the underlying BTC is there at all?

I think it will be like the BCH fork. Uncertainty put a damper on the price right up until the fork. Once the fork happened and BTC was "safe" again, it shot up massively. Seems like something very similar could happen this time.

God, no. The profitability of mining is a key principle of Bitcoin's design. It is a competitive free market. Why do you think so many companies (and now some govts) are investing in mining operations? Because it's profitable, as long as you keep up with your competition in terms of efficiency.

Anyone can fork Bitcoin. You, as an individual, could download the source code, make a few changes, start up a node, and poof! You have made a hard fork of Bitcoin. The question is, how many people are going to voluntarily switch over to using your version? 
There have been lots of these forks. Segwit2X is just the latest one. And yes it is troubling that people with substantial wealth and power in the crypto community are introducing hard forks due to selfish and shortsighted motives, and have a plan to try to win majority support for their version. Thing is, Bitcoin is open source software and so hard forks are always going to be possible. It's just the nature of the system, and ideally, it's healthy. It's a mechanism by which someone can introduce some changes, and let the market decide if they like those changes.
I'm optimistic that on Nov 16, the market is going to dump a lot of cold water on the S2X folks. But no one knows for sure how it'll play out. The absence of replay protection this time means this is more of a direct attack than the past forks have been.

Thanks; that's a valid concern that I did not address in my post. I will say that Bitcoin is a young project under active development. I agree that the network today is not perfect, and especially bad at small and low-fee transactions. But big improvements are coming, and I believe they will be worth the wait.
It's totally fine if you prefer a different crypto - Bitcoin Cash or any other. But you're talking as if Bitcoin is going to stay in its present state permanently, and I don't see it that way.

true, but its misleading to say that all altcoin projects are forked from the bitcoin repo, which is what was implied above

i can't make you un-drink Roger's kool-aid. But I will say for the sake of argument - my whole point is, even if 95% of BTC's current hashrate left for some reason, the difficulty and the economics of mining would shift, and the chain would go on. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:09:21
Unless they revise their position (again), Coinbase will handle the fork for you. After the fork, you'll still have the same amount of BTC, and an equal amount of B2X.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! 
- I agree that Bitcoin is not ready to be understood and used by "the masses" yet. But, we do have a steady stream of individual and institutional investors who *are* doing the legwork to learn about it, and making themselves ready to buy in. In other words, yes mass adoption is a ways off, but also, adoption will continue to increase at a healthy rate.
- Regarding the fork: if I read your comment correctly, it sounds like you're concerned about the NYA and thereby the Segwit2X movement. I think the majority of the people in this subreddit share those concerns, and that's why there is a strong "no 2x" sentiment around here. We prefer to support the ongoing work of the open-source dev team, who have a long-term vision and (from what I can tell) are a lot less interested in profit, control, centralization, etc.

In many other industries, if the CEOs of most of the biggest companies got together and made a backroom deal in order to consolidate their power, chances are they would be able to pull it off, and quite possibly in a way that not many people would ever notice. We can say something similar about many governments.
What we have gotten to see with Bitcoin is that when this sort of power play is attempted, the only way it can happen is wide out in the open, and it gets widely scrutinized and discussed. Not only that but all of the individuals behind it are pulled out into the spotlight, and have their motives and their competence questioned. And in this case, the independent community made its opposition so clear and firm that the would-be forkers chose to *completely back down* from their plans. They bowed to the power of the community, because they realized they could not defeat it. This is a beautiful moment for Bitcoin.

To some extent it's already happening; I have seen people say that bitcoin is "too expensive" and they don't really understand that they can buy any fraction of a coin.
I don't think this will be a blocking issue though; as the value climbs I think other standards such as Satoshis/USD or mBTC will become more commonplace.

Depends what you mean by "spent," but, probably not.
Think of it this way: every time you SOLD on any exchange, whether that was selling for BTC or USD or whatever, is a taxable event. The proceeds from that sale, minus the cost basis (the amount that went into the BUY order), is capital gains income. But I'm no tax accountant, so go verify everything for yourself! Good luck :)

A HUGE amount of electricity is consumed by bitcoin miners - right now about 30 terawatt hours per year, or slightly less than the country of Morocco. But that's for network security, which is a separate concept than transaction processing.

It's an increase in block size. But it's a downgrade in terms of software version. The core client is now on v0.15, but the Segwit2X version is based on v0.14. So a lot of the latest refinements to the codebase will get *reverted*. Not quite an upgrade in my eyes.
Check out the release notes  to see everything that isn't included in the Segwit2X fork of the code. It's a pretty long list.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:45:43
good first question! the general theory is that money has 3 functions: store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account, and they tend to develop in that order. So when you say "a tool for trading," to me that means a medium of exchange, and I don't think Bitcoin is there yet, though it's making good progress. the first step is to become a store of value, aka something that more and more people are attracted to and want to hoard. Once it has enough success there, then becoming a medium of exchange would be the next step, after the market has established confidence that the good is desirable and holds its value over time. It will also need to be less volatile by this point - and if you look for studies of Bitcoin's volatility, you will see that it has been trending downwards over time.
If you do a search for some of these terms you will find lots of good articles on the subject :)

Twice this year, bitcoin has dipped by about 40% and then quickly rebounded to new heights. The present dip isn't even close to 40% yet.
The reason to hold on, is that bitcoin is super volatile and will remain that way for a while. If you try to start timing the market - by buying and selling based on how you think the market is about to move - you are at risk of falling into a stressful and neverending vortex of obsessively checking prices, second-guessing your positions, and paying lots of fees and short-term gains tax as you buy back and forth. And sooner or later you will make mistakes, and you will curse yourself for those mistakes. 
If you simply hold - over time you get used to tuning out the short term volatility. I encourage you to look at a year-long, logarithmic price for bitcoin. It really puts the dips in perspective. Holding through your first dip, especially if you bought in near the peak, is really tough. But every time, it gets easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:01:40

Not the 2mb blocks themselves, but the contentious hard fork, that proposes going back from client v0.15 to v0.14, and putting source control on the hands of a group with very different motives.
The Bitcoin core repository is very carefully maintained, and constantly improved. Just look at the GitHub history. Then look at the btc1 branch: it looks like a total wasteland, with one part-time contributor. Which does not look good, for the future of this $100 billion network.

What gives you confidence that a real dip will happen? After the BCH fork, the BTC price headed straight up.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:37:06
Hodling is easier when the price is climbing. I feel like the two-year slump after 2013 might be more deserving of the title "The Great HODL." And if we continue to climb, that will be due to a steady influx of newbies, who will inevitably want to try day trading.
Second thought - it won't be long until the next big threat comes along. Bitcoin had been under attack for years, and as it grows these will only get more intense.

Agreed! But, there are legal ways to cash out tax-free. The main one I'm thinking of is [this]( - if my only income each year is $35,000 from the sale of BTC, I owe no taxes.
And the options might expand in the future. If BTC really does become a more mainstream, global currency, that could really change the landscape of taxation based on national borders.

There are different opinions about how useful it is to add more nodes to the network. Here's how I understand it:
If you are an active Bitcoin user sending and receiving transactions, it really does help the network health to do so using your own node. As opposed to using a 3rd party service which can lead to centralization. Example from recent history: thousands of merchants use the BitPay app to accept Bitcoin in their shops, but that means the BitPay company can make centralized decisions. Case in point, BitPay wanted to embrace the Segwit2x fork, and had the power to push that out as a software update to all the thousands of merchants using their app. If all those merchants had been running their own nodes, BitPay wouldn't have any of that power. So if we want Bitcoin to truly be a decentralized network, that means the individual users need to stay empowered, with their own nodes, validating according to the consensus rules version of their choice, instead of delegating that choice to a centralized 3rd party.
So that's the value of running your own node if you're a pretty active user. If your node is just acting as a repeater for other participants' activity, we don't really need that, as there is already more than enough redundancy in that regard.

Lending is one "safe" way. E.g. you can lend out your BTC on Poloniex to margin traders, and probably make several % a year. The exchange guarantees that your coins are always safe, but of course there is always some risk with exchanges.

Time isn't the only thing we need distributed consensus for. Confirming transaction signatures as valid, enforcing the supply cap, etc. At the root of it, we need PoW because if it's not expensive to produce valid blocks, the network would be very vulnerable to attack/takeover. I don't think quantum entanglement changes any of that.

Some places show an "index" price that is some kind of weighted average from several different exchanges - news sites like CoinDesk do this, and market data sites like CoinMarketCap. If you visit an individual exchange's website, you'll see the particular price on that one exchange. To see lots of different exchange prices at the same time, try [ or [ (note that these displays have overwhelming amounts of detail, and probably lots of fake volume/price info from the shadier exchanges).
And as another commenter pointed out, arbitrage traders usually keep the difference between exchanges to a minimum, and they are getting better at it over time.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:20:04
Yeah, it makes me think this can't be right. CMC might still be including volume from a lot of exchanges known to fake most of their trading volume. I'm sure today was a high-volume day, but not \*that\* high.

It's not a "need." People are voluntarily hooking up more mining machines because it's profitable for them to do so.
The Bitcoin network works the same, and has the same transaction capacity, whether there are 100 miners or 100000.

the site i used (bitcoin.tax) is free for a very small # of transactions, but after that it's a flat $30 I think. it's very worth it if you have tons of trades back and forth and want help sorting them out. I was quite happy with their service.

i guess it depends on what exactly we mean by "joint."
remember the scene in Willy Wonka, where the rich guy has like 500 people opening bars of chocolate for him? It's like that. So you could say that they are working jointly to find the golden ticket, but you could also say they are working separately because each person is unwrapping different bars of chocolate. it wouldn't make sense to coordinate multiple people to work on the same chocolate bar together.

to be clear, assembling the block with the transactions etc is like .00001% of the work, and can be done instantly. the other 99.9999% of the work is basically "now find a random number that luckily makes the final hash value of the block start with sixteen zeros." so it really is about trying tons of random numbers as fast as possible. a simple problem repeated many times, not a complex problem that calls for high-level coordination.

A transaction is composed from previously unspent outputs. You have to move the entire output, but by default, wallet software will send any extra (the "change") back to you - either to the same address, or to a change address that is controlled by your same private key.

because coinbase will have a deposit record that looks like this: "received 1 BTC from address 0xABC... credited to account of user skinz101." 0xABC is your cold storage address, and now coinbase and anyone else who sees coinbase's records can see the total amount stored at that address, and they could easily search for all other transactions that touched that address.

I don't know; here's another [thread]( with some more details and technical discussion.
It's cool that Binance disclosed some details about what was happening, and it's cool that they decided to shut down (and lose some business, take some flak, etc) rather than continuing to operate unsafely. 
All these exchanges are growing really fast and are relatively young companies, so I try to forgive mistakes (and this might have been a cloud hiccup rather than a dev mistake anyway) as long as it looks like the team is working hard with good intentions.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:32:02
See  and  as a couple of examples - basically, there are heuristics that can look for association and likely ownership of different addresses. So for example, maybe law enforcement has an automated tool that says "skinz101 reported owning only 1 BTC, but our blockchain analysis algorithm suggests that he probably owns this other address with 100 BTC, so, let's flag him for an audit."

The easiest and quickest way, but also probably the riskiest, is to have your BTC on a supporting exchange at the moment of the fork snapshot. That's what I did for Bitcoin Gold. That way you get your fork coins right away, and can sell right away, without fussing with a new wallet or waiting for the new chain to confirm any transactions.
I think there is a wallet or two - Coinomi? - that will help you split your BTC and BTG. Wallet support for S2X is much less certain, especially since replay protection is still TBD.

I feel like the "full faith and credit of the US gov't" line is a carryover from the gold standard days, when the government actually guaranteed that you could exchange your dollar for a fixed amount of something else (gold). No such guarantee about exchange or purchasing power today. I feel like all they can say is "yes, we like dollars here, and each dollar is worth... a dollar." Not very reassuring.

Neither. It just means more competition among miners, and a lower expected reward for them per hash.

Guys, the world is watching Bitcoin, and we need to be better than this.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:11:04
It's a common misconception that Bitcoin needs so many miners "to process the transactions." Not really. Bitcoin could process the same number of transactions with just a few people running CPU or GPU mining nodes.
No, Bitcoin has so much mining because it *is designed to incentivize mining as part of its security model.* Miners are paid with newly minted bitcoins, i.e. inflation. Right now the inflation rate is 4% per year, so, in rough terms we can expect about 4% of Bitcoin's total market value to get spent on electricity for mining each year. 
Since Bitcoin is quite valuable, that is a lot of electricity. But think about it from a larger perspective. What overhead security cost seems reasonable, for a first-of-its-kind, global, trustless, decentralized ledger? If I told you we could have such a system, for just 4% overhead, you might say, "that sounds like a pretty good deal!"
Think about the incumbent systems that Bitcoin potentially challenges. Banks, fiat currencies, and governments. How efficient are those entities? More importantly, what kinds of impact do those entities have on the world? A lot more, and a lot worse, than just electricity. I'm talking about wars, poverty, oppression, the whole nine yards. Bitcoin is, in a way, the tip of a spear that could disrupt some of these systems. And yes, it demands a bunch of electricity, but it doesn't demand war or deforestation or nationalistic sanctions etc etc etc.
Bitcoin is potentially *much* better, *much* cleaner, *much* more ethical, and *much* more efficient than some of the systems it threatens to replace. 
End rant :)

This right here. Specifically, the subreddit rules prohibit "Pumping－Pushing speculative, volatile, or illiquid investments, especially flippantly, tersely, or implying huge returns."
Bitcoin is certainly speculative and volatile, and huge returns are often implied. So I think it's mostly fair of them to protest or moderate posts about BTC (as much as I wish they'd be more open to it).
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:20:26

You're making a straw man argument. Sure, if everyone always holds and no one ever sells/spends, Bitcoin won't replace fiat. But no one is proposing or predicting that. HODLing forever makes no sense... what makes sense is HODLing until mainstream adoption, if it comes. The common expectation is that as adoption grows, volatility will go down, and the utility and ease of use will go up. As this happens, more and more HODLers will start to spend from their stack.

nope, no joint work. every individual mining machine is capable of doing tons (millions? not sure) of complete solutions per second, so it doesn't make sense for them to share. at most, the central coordinator might assign a range to each miner - like, miner A will try all nonce values starting with 0 while miner B tries all nonce values starting with 1, something like that.

That's the idea, yes. The prevailing opinion in this sub is that it's best to keep holding Bitcoin long-term.

You can send to multiple outputs - 
As far as "coins to X must be from A"... no, I don't think that is possible in a single transaction, regardless of the software you're using.

Even in a price crash scenario, I think the incentives for miners to stay honest outweigh the incentives of launching an attack.

"peer to peer" in the Bitcoin sense just means there is no 3rd party to facilitate the transaction. so, making a purchase from a business can still be "peer to peer," if that business runs its own Bitcoin node.

Sorry if I was offensive. This thread was about Formercoiners and it seemed on-topic to mention a well-known person who fits that description. It's settled that Binfinex used to own coins, but now does not, right?
He is different from other types of people you mention exactly because he *has no money in the game.* And yet, he remains so focused and so vocal on this topic! Why? He must still feel some strong emotion about it... it could be some kind of noble impulse, like you suggest, a desire to catch some cheaters and protect the community, etc. Or, it could be that he's neurotically fixated on something that hurt him in the past.
From my reading of the tone, timing, and content of his posts on Medium and Twitter, I feel like it's the latter. Even if his criticisms are totally valid (and they might be! I go back and forth), I wish he could find a more tactful way to discuss them, and honestly I worry about his mental health, too.

I totally hear you. But still - when you have basically a beginner audience, I think immutability is not the best thing to lead with... it could create a confused first impression, like "blockchains are magic things that can't be changed! i have no idea how that's possible, but i guess it is!" 
I guess I'm still searching for what the ideal beginner intro would be. Something like "blockchains are verified and preserved by a large distributed network, making them much more resistant to change or corruption than systems based on a centralized, trusted point of control," but of course that is already complicated enough to make some eyes glaze over...

Crypto is such a new thing that I would not look too much to conventional educational institutions. I certainly wouldn't expect many schools to be offering crypto-related degrees within the next few years. Classes, yes, degrees, no. Personally I think your best path will be to self-teach, online, by reading everything you can, from whitepapers to pull requests to Reddit threads. Study crypto specifically, and the languages they are written in (tons of free or cheap  online resources for learning any programming language under then sun). And then start contributing, where you can, to some of the open-source projects.

Pretty awesome, and congrats! I do have a question, though. You said -


Isn't it important to include the fact that a blockchain's immutability depends on the strength of its network? Bitcoin is nearly immutable at this point, because most of the SHA256 hashing power in the world is already dedicated to it, but some new little chain could easily be taken over or even rewritten by a malicious third party with enough money or hash power to dominate the consensus mechanism (be it POW or POS or whatever).
As blockchains enter the public awareness more, it seems like this distinction is really important. If a promise is made that *all* blockchains are *inherently* immutable, that could create a false sense of trust between users and providers of "blockchain-based" services.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:28:59
I'm definitely anti-S2X, but I respect Gemini's position. They are simply choosing to remain as neutral as possible, and that means doing the same thing they did during the least hard fork (BCH).
Exchanges can try to give themselves a lot of power in the community, by actively supporting or opposing changes like forks. I think Gemini is just choosing to say, "we aren't here to decide what Bitcoin is. That's up to the users, the miners, and the market. We're just here to provide basic exchange services." 
And I respect that.
EDIT: after seeing [this comment]( I am much less a fan of the stance taken by Gemini and Coinbase. Cumulative POW should be used for determining the main chain within a set of consensus rules - not for determining which fork gets which name. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:42:16
Glad to hear you say that. The name thing (S2X fork wanting to claim the title of "the real Bitcoin") really is the main problem with S2X. If it was just a hard fork that would take on a new name, a la Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold, I would personally have no objections to it. If this is really about letting the market decide, best to keep the naming convention clear, so that the market can decide based on technical and economic merit.

"How do cryptocurrencies get hacked" and "How do you identify the person behind a certain address" are separate questions.
In terms of the second question - yes, in the case of a simple bitcoin robbery, it's easy to see where the coins moved to. You can monitor that address, and see if the coins move again, etc. It's harder to find out what person controls that address, but there are ways. See chainalysis.com for an example service. 
There are various strategies to make bitcoins harder to track, such as tumbling (kind of like money laundering). Or, they could be swapped for another currency on an anonymous exchange. 
But none of this has anything to do with the question of "how is a cryptocurrency hacked?" Not all crimes involving bitcoin are "hacks," and not all criminals are "hackers."

yeah, there are minimum fees for transactions under $200.  I'm not a fan.

The HODLer in you needs to get bigger and stronger. Don't allow yourself to sell based on quick price movements up or down! If we hit a truly huge parabolic move up (like "sweet mother of God it's a new paradigm!" territory), then I might sell a small % of my stack, but that's it.
There's a wonderful clarity and simplicity in committing to hold long term.

It's very legitimizing for Bitcoin, to be portrayed as something that Facebook hopes to rival.

There is a meaningful difference between "Time Magazine Says" and "Time Magazine publishes an editorial from an outside contributor that says..."

I don't think we're "waiting" for SEC approval. But it would nonetheless be nice to have. It would help bring more people and institutions into the space.

For the most part, using/spending Bitcoin is not what drives the price up. Hoarding them is what makes them more scarce, driving up the price. 
 makes this argument pretty well.

In my opinion the only sane way to invest in BTC is for the long term. It's so volatile that it will make you seasick and/or insane to follow every upswing and downswing. 
This also means not putting in more than you can afford to lose. So, if you put in so much that you can't bear to watch the price drop, then sure, sell some. But for the most part, you should buy whatever amount you can hold for the best floor e years at least. Buy it and forget it... don't try to play games with the short term price, or the market manipulators will chew you up pretty fast.

the mobile fees have been higher for a while, so yeah maybe they didn't change today. on their website, do you use ActiveTrader? if so, then yes it it still 1%. but for us plebs who haven't signed up for ActiveTrader, yes, definitely, they changed their user agreement and the fee schedule today.

If you follow the Twitter link you can see some more discussion there

they have several different fee schedules now. to find the fee schedule for "regular" web users, that don't have access to their ActiveTrader program, you have to go to their User Agreement and find the fees section.

lots of exchanges fake their volume data, and from what I can tell, coinmarketcap doesn't do much to correct for that.

Not until all the individual mining nodes that heard about your transaction decide to discard it. Default is two weeks, I think, but the configuration can be changed but the node operator.

It's a valid question. Trezor's code is open source, so someone likely would have noticed if they are doing anything sneaky with the private key. But then, we are trusting that the open-source community will do such a review.
Thing is, I think we can't really get to a 100% trustless system. Maybe there are a few people out there who have the time and know-how to independently inspect every line of code in Bitcoin Core, and every line of code in Trezor's wallet, etc, but for the rest of us, we do have to trust at some point. I, for example, follow a lot of Bitcoin developers and crypto lawyers and other folks on Twitter. Over time, I make a decision: "this person seems like a real expert, acting in good faith. I trust their opinion at this point." So I think that's how we have to evaluate service providers like Ledger and Trezor too. I forget their username, but the CTO or CEO of Ledger is active on Reddit, and seeing how they respond in various conversations built a lot of trust for me (EDIT: see great response from below!). I think they legitimately believe in the values of a decentralized, sovereign monetary future, and have pinned their personal reputation to upholding those values.
So, for the most part we can't be 100% trustless here. But we can and should be careful and systematic about who and how we choose to trust.

No. The book is pretty good. In the last year or two, his writing on BTC has been more skeptical/bearish, but he does generally get the facts right, much more than most journalists covering crypto stories.

The same was often true in the 2017 bull market. When Bitcoin really moves, it knocks everything else down. I often visualize BTC as a giant, with little altcoins clinging to its back and trying to climb, but when the giant starts moving....

Every 4 years, the reward paid out to miners gets cut in half. Since these mining rewards are effectively inflation, this means that inflation gets cut in half. Next year will be the 3rd halving, and inflation will drop from about 4% to about 2%.

I'm implying that for the most part we can't be "trustless." We can minimize trust, we can be more careful and specific about who and what we trust, but yes, using Bitcoin still does require some trust.

agreed that its a bad deployment strategy. borderline nefarious in terms of not thinking through what the change would be like for existing users. 
how do you access the old UI and fee schedule though? are you talking about ActiveTrader?
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:53:12
yeah i've sent in a request for ActiveTrader... and I'm still peeved that they dropped this change without any notice... not panicked, but peeved.
