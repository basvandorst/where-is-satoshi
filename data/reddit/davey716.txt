I’m pretty sure some cards started charging fees to buy cryptos. Don’t quote me on that
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:57:00
If that cash is hitting YOUR bank account then yes you will 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:19:58
Sell them bitches and have yourself a great 2018. 
Cheers 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:32:17
It’s pretty low right now
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:19:24
Why on earth would you invest your college fund lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:32:13
1. Since you’re new, I’m sure you don’t have a hardware wallet yet so another option is a wallet called “breadwallet”. You can store your coins with them. Make sure to write down the seed!
2. Delete your account on coinbase immediately 
3. Open an account with Gemini
4. Gainz 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:10
Yeah the exchanges are locked
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:12:09
I hope one of them is mine
Edit: nope
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:30:31
How would 19k be the top when it already passed 19k? Lol

People have been saying it’s a bubble when it was 2 dollars a coin lol. As long as it keeps its infrastructure, innovations, believers and we keep breaking down these psychological barriers, we will be the pioneers into a great technological advance. A big problem right now is that it’s getting SO much spotlight by the media, celebrities, governments and tons of people are flowing in looking to make a quick buck without researching and understanding the potential crypto has. So to answer your question, no I don’t think it’s a bubble but yes I do believe we will see some drops in price when all these newbies figure out btc is still in development. But hey, that ain’t nothing new ������
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:00:53
The only reason I got into crypto was because I have faith in the tech. That was over a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:30:35
Could you reiterate these “points” lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:36:43
Trading it is fairly difficult because of the transaction fees/times as of right now. Most people I’ve talked to whom have tried this come out with little to no profit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:47
No lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:01
I wish people understood this. 
Now that it’s mainstream, all those people see are dollar signs. Hopefully the majority of those people learn along the way and stick around.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:36:27
Good work, Bond.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:41:04
Lol I feel you. I have games on steam that would accumulate several thousand dollars now lmao
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:37:33
Not coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:30:05
Dickriders, the whole bunch of them
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:16:52
I think the difference is, is that you can put a sell order in on gdax which will automatically sell for you. As where coinbase doesn’t have that option so you gotta sit and refresh over and over until you’re able too
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:14:25
When you and your dad find it, tell everyone you didn’t find it. Money fucking tears families up my dude.

Disclaimer: I’m not 100 percent sure this will work with yahoo. But with that said, I know you can report gmail accounts to be “compromised” and they retrieve every single email ever sent or received EVER. Could try that with yahoo?

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:28:11
I bought mine beginning of 2017 and reddit lol was so fascinated by the idea
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:55
Do you have to be holding your bitcoin on the exchange in order to get the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:18:58
If we had the answer to this, we’d all be rich as fuck. No one knows which direction the market will go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:50:43
Cause of the huge crypto boom that’s occurred, majority of the new people want to be the guys who had 1000 bitcoin back in 2010, thinking they will become millionaires. Unfortunate 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:02:33

But for real. I know there is a chain of vending machines that will exchange your gift card for cash. I forget the name though so I’m not much help lol
Edit: that is, if you’re in the states. I’ll try and figure out what it’s called
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:08:45
Got in around 700-800ish. I liked the tech and decentralization. 
Yes we all know there are some large issues with transaction speeds/fees.  Everything ever created has its trials and tribulations but I still believe crypto as a whole is a huge technological advance in our world. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:00

Yeah nicehash
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:02:23
People aren’t just entering it for promises of a quick buck? I entered bitcoin because I read about the technology and thought that one day it could do something great. That was last year. Never heard the word before, just stumbled upon an article. And I’d say the majority of people who are in bitcoin are here for the same reason. Right now, people are seeing it make some ground and those are the ones who only see a cash cow. There are still thousands upon thousands of other people who support its ideas. Do some research before you shit post
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:45
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:51
Man, they explain this like a religion over at r/xrp.
Ltc to gdax, gdax to kraken, convert. 
Please research before doing things like this.
Also yes, you must have 20 xrp in toast in order to store more. 
Lesson learned

No way lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:32
Okay thanks. The only real answer I’ve gotten so far lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:25:39
I’ve seen you post responses along these lines, could you inform us with how you came to these numbers? :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:47:32
Could you link me more info pls? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:01:27

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:56
Lesson learned eh?
I did the same thing back in the hundreds and low thousands. Now I just hold and hold
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:55
I literally just did both lol
Edit: idiot
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:29:49
Posts like this need to be reported. A lot of new people may take this seriously and do just this sort of things. Reported.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:33:25
Those are the same people who promote fucking coinbase lmao.
They are leeches name dropping Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:58:14
Funner fact: I remember when it was a bubble at 2 doll hairs

Bro it’s okay sell portions for things you need in life lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:57:23
Lol yeah dude needs to calm down, he’s about to have a breakdown 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:58:17
Not yet but I will be. Been doing some research into ripple (xrp)
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:06
I’d say the holiday season. Ppl selling portions for presents, traveling etc
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:55:06
It can’t and it won’t. The only real way for enormous drops like that would be infrastructure crashes or governmental hands. People like this guy think that everyone who holds, owns like 500 bitcoin and will sell and crash the market lol. More people own less then 1btc then people who own over 1btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:36
Just sent mine over from breadwallet. FREE BITCOIN THANK YOU BTRASH
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:20
I must admit I had my funds transferred to my exchange of choice and contemplated selling but I held strong and bought more instead lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:27:29
People have been calling bitcoin a bubble for years and years lol. Just like anything, there will be doubters and negativity. 
Anyway, I think an infrastructure collapse, or major government bans would cause a crash. Also if everyone sold every coin they owned lol. 
Welcome to the club
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:05:10
30k is set in stone for me. I’ve been wanting to expand my portfolio into other cryptos because having this amount of money into one, isn’t smart. 
That being said, I will still hodl onto some bitcoin but there is a lot of promising cryptos out there!
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:49:14
Virtually every single person to sell all their coins
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:58:44
Lol right. All those suicide posts smh
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:22:48
The sad thing is, fresh spawns will read this and panic. Why must people speak on things, they know little about? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:50:34
I’ll give you 500 for it but you gotta send me the code first
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:06:02
1. Infrastructure crash 2. USA Governmental ban

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:13:47
Didn’t need to buy it. Got a bunch for free and will be using those to buy more bitcoin lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:09:35
From what I’ve learned, the best way it to get it is to get eth, transfer it to binance and convert it into ripple. 
A lot of their community is saying it will be available through coinbase sometime next year. If that’s true, I wanna get a couple thousand before hand lol. CB will make it skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:48:00
Dude you chose whatever crypto you see is best. They all offer different things. Whichever you believe in, go for it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:49
I know it’s shit. I just didn’t know the ratio
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:25
It’s already 10:30 pst lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:43:40
The biggest issue is the transfer/withdraws/deposits. For example, with bitcoin. It can take up to a few days to get your coins and with the volatility/fluctuation with this market, the price could be significantly lower then when you bought them. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:11:01
I use breadwallet. Transferred different coins into multiple breadwallets, wrote down all the security words, locked them into a safe and have them also written down inside a safe at the bank. Deleted the apps and just sit on em

If you have the means to buy a couple coins and your life WILL NOT be effected by it, then go for it. If not then buy 20-30 bucks a week

Bought four at 500 a pop
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:15:02

@_date: 2017-03-14 10:58:05
I had owned a few coins for a couple months. Got them around the 800 mark but recently cashed completely out. I don't have much belief in this system. The China ban and etf is turning it into a pipe dream and the only thing people see is "too the moon" or "10k by 2020" and that's not what this was supposed to be. It wasn't supposed to be turned into money making money, it was about changing the standards of currency. In my opinion, using cryptocurrency to buy things online has become more of a hassle then just paying with my debit card. That's what people want, hassle free but with bitcoin, that's not what you get. You have confirmation times, fees, wallets, codes, verifications, basically a whole lot of hoops to jump through just to buy a game on steam... I truly hope it does work out for everyone and that you all "hodl" to the moon but I just don't see that happening.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:10:41
Don't ever keep your cryptos on an exchange. Transfer them to cold storage, paper or wallet. Those will have the extra security you would need if any of those things were to happen and then you'll be able to recover your accounts and coins.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:24:45
Put a little in every week. I bought a whole coin at 2k and have just been putting 50 in a week.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:19:32
Noooo just withdrawal of 1,000 or more dollars
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:18:09
I have also looked into the future and can confirm that people will buy btc if it goes up or down
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:03:56
I'm gonna look into this 
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:32:34
Your bank put a freeze on your account for trying to buy out of the county. Call and tell them you made that purchase 
@_date: 2017-01-08 09:23:35
What is the limit?
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:47:49
Nope. Bought a few coins then and just bought a few more now. As long as you are in it for the long haul and see the potential. It won't matter in a few years from now. If anything you'll be upset you didn't buy more at 1100$ lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:30:52
I think he said seven thousand 
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:02:46
Yeah anything over 1k withdraw they put a hold onto my account until I confirm with them that I made the withdraw. I.e. Id confirmation and a bunch of other stuff
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:04:23
The exchange I use takes a week so I feel your pain lol 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:30:58
I almost went blind seeing the 250 drop in an hour lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:08:10
That's really strange cause I just transferred $100 worth for 2 dollar fee
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:56:21
Bought some at a thousand and will buy more when it drops! Gonna hold tight

Just put in, what you can afford, weekly or monthly. Don’t dive all in. That’s the basics brother. It looks good now and will probably reach 9kish within a couple weeks but in two months it could be in the 6ks again.

Yeah I usually buy through CB and transfer to my wallet but when I saw that, I figured I could cut out some transfer fees.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:28:49
And then I buy 30k worth. Ez money

If they wanna buy my bitcoins, they can give me 500k per coin, plus transfer fees, plus monthly fees in order to hold my coins and if they don't transfer .025 into a secondary account every month then they get fined, also they will be fined for not having at all coins in one account
