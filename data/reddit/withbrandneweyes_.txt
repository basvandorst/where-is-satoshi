He's a shady dude. He was one of the first investors in Theranos. He outright lied about their blood testing technology in 2016 which we now all know was completely fabricated. 
 "In a 2016 interview with Rebecca Jarvis Tim Draper claimed that he saw '50 tests being run on 2 drops of blood' using Theranos technology and 'it worked beautifully'"

Tim Draper was also one of the first investors in Theranos and he lied about their technology in a 2016 interview, so I wouldn't put too much stock in his words.

Wrong. He is not a good investor. He is a rich VC investor because his daddy and granddaddy were rich VC investors. He was one of the first investors in Theranos. He lied about their technology in a 2016 interview and continued to defend Holmes and attack whistleblowers even after the revelations of fraud had been made public by the WSJ.

This is not a quick, reactionary take. "Shady" was being polite. Did you watch the video? The technology that he claims that he used in that 2016 interview never existed. He is complicit in their fraud and we're talking about one of the biggest cases of fraud in Silicon Valley, ever. The best case scenario is that he is a highly incompetent investor who didn't even practice the tiniest iota of due diligence. This was a company that had been engaged in fraud since 2006*  He was one of their first investors and the last of their defenders. After the revelations of fraud were made publicly available by the WSJ, Draper defended Holmes (and attacked the journalist, John Carreyrou) claiming that she was the real victim of a "witch hunt"**. He is the complete opposite of a victim. He actively advocated against the defrauded in favor of the defrauder. He attacked whistleblowers and tried to spin Holme's fraud as a conspiracy against her. Theranos is a 15-year-old company (RIP). It's almost certain over the course of time that he knew something was wrong. It's also very likely (albeit speculative) that Draper invested in Theranos and was an attack dog for Holmes not due to promising technology or because he saw a wise investment opportunity, but because he grew up with Holmes and was close with her family. ↟ 
In conclusion: Draper is not shady, he's an outright scumbag who didn't earn his way into the SV VC world (he inherited his seat from his father). He's a pariah, that those who are wise would be best to avoid.
