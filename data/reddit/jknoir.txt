Nah as in losing everything you were holding out for. Like people say, we've all got our own moons.

Y'all crazy as fuck sometimes. Sure we might all be millionaires one day but, depending when we got in, we might also lose everything. Know what you're in this thing for and buy/sell accordingly.

Good point, it's been wall to wall quality posts lately and I feel bad for ruining it.

Thanks for the detailed reply! I'll definitely check those articles out. Do you think the price will/needs to stabilise before it can reach full mainstream adoption? I just think that the idea that if you held Bitcoin your money could be worth more or less (e.g. compared to USD) day to day might be off putting for people. I supposed though the end goal would be to have everything be priced in BTC so theoretically in that case it wouldn't change.

Fair point but that kind of goes to what I'm saying. If there's another coin that essentially offers the same experience/ease of use which has a "price" similar to what people are used to I think psychologicaly people will gravitate towards that one.
People generally own gold as a store of value, not to transact with (although if you want to take it all the way back they were still thinking in terms of one or multiple gold coins). I just think I might be hard for people to get used to paying 0.0011234 Bitcoin for anything.
