I sure hope so! Thank you very much.

Wow, I'm a complete idiot. I never even thought of searching here. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:46:45
Thank you so much. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:17:42
Ahh. Wish I could edit it. 
Honest question, but why wouldn't that work with an anonymous survey?

Smart people aren't going to be posting how much money they have.

Is this a valid point? How will transaction fees work with small purchases like this?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:19:29
Oh that makes sense. Thanks!

I should make my own. I don't trust them and their funny accents.

Context, brother.

I'm in the same boat as op, so this comment made me smile. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:28:11
That's why I didn't just start rattling off questions right away. The sidebar is helpful, but there's a few questions that aren't answered there. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:29:29
1 internet? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:13:11
Ah, so that's how it works. Thank you very much.

I have a quick question when purchasing a gift card through Gyft. When I pay a certain amount with BTC to their address, how will they know who paid for it and how would I receive the card?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:03:12
I watched that for too damn long. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:54:48
Simple things. Do people treat bitcoins like stocks? Where as I should just buy x amount of bitcoins, leave them be, and hope they just rise in price? Or should I start future proofing and use them as much as possible for purchases?
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:24:41
This is for sure against their TOS.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:21:53
Lol, that's not how this kind of growth works....
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:27:11
Stupid post. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:21:25
Still boggles my mind why *none* of them are doing this. There doesn't seem to be a downfall in doing so.

Fuck yeah, corgis rule.

513 as I post :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:39
Well that was a quick bump back up. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:27:50
There was a graph I saw a few months ago that showed that we are still in the "early adopters" stage. Are we still there? Or have we left it with all the attention the media has given Bitcoin?

I was leaning more on my financial future. I wanted to see if it would be a good investment. From what I've read in the past few days, it seems like it's going to boom.

I've known about Bitcoin for about a year now. To be honest, I forgot about it until about 3 weeks ago. Saw the article about the guy forgetting his btc's and now they're worth like 800k or something. Did some research for a week, and bought just one  a little over a week ago. It's been real fun following this. 
Luckily for me, I have a friend who's been in Bitcoin for a while now, so the curve is bearable.
