This is a serious concern. The security of funds is of the utmost importance and this issue should be fixed asap.

 Glad I live in Canada where the Banks are more closely monitored and regulated. No bailouts here as they were not necessary.

This is what naysayers don't understand, when they say, "Why would  Venezuelans buy Bitcoin?  The price is crashing".  Relativity is key here.  It's not crashing at any rate remotely as bad as the bf and  Bitcoin is more likely to go back up.
