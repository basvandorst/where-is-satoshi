What's the need for bitcoin when you can buy tulips if you want to get rich buy stocks of real companies that creat real things. Soon we will buy and sell using  shares on the blockchain. Bitcoin is only used to keep the network neutral and distributed by paying miners something. This will change.

I have to say this,
Communism was an utopian idea
Self reinforcing processes are what drive humans from politics to economics to relationships..... things become unbalanced and that's what creates bubbles
The blockchain is most probably the greatest invention since the internet but it is still in the human domain.
There is no way of valuing bitcoin it's only value is what humans think they are and is driven now by the thought of it only going up. 
Bitcoin has at least 3 self reinforcing processes at play that make it so powerful and that is so scary that whole governments could get caught in this.
To say that mining bitcoins is input effort like  pumping oil baking bread or producing goods for consumption is crazy, it's purely reward to keep it going and supposedly out of corporate or governments hands is also crazy
If you say it's for investment there is no return except for the miners, or as long as it keeps going up.
For those who got in at $5 $50 $500 $1000 can take a hit from $10k to $1k but what about the rest.
You can print as much money you like as long as you have means of production delivery or distribution and a market.
Some will say this is overvalued some will say it's a bubble some will say it's undervalued.... what should it's value be,
Will there be an event that makes it go much higher or collapse?
The tech is amazing I love it but I'm wary of humans
Institutions are getting into the game and creating platforms to short BC, this is a big sign.
I'm not wanting a debate, I just want to create food for thought and for people to think about this thing.

Warren buffet only buys companies at are at least 10 years old, that he understands, that increase their turnover every year, that make a profit every year, that have some barrier to entry, that don't have to keep investing money into their business "continuous tech upgrades, repairs and maintenance" and have understandable financial records....... this gives him a fair certainty of the future.......1 in his hand is worth 10 in the bush
wonder why he's rich
