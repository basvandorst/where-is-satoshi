This is awesome. Out of curiosity, did this all start with Blade Runner? I hope so.

I introduced some friends to Bloodninja recently. Good times were had.

Sounds like it.
I say nobody has any business looking in my wallets and accounts but me, but explain that to the government.
If you're going on pogey, it makes sense that they require verification, though (not that I agree).

Canada has high booze taxes. I actually live in Montréal, Québec, where it's cheaper than (all/most of?) the rest of Canada. I've lived in Ontario, BC, Alberta and New Brunswick, and they were all more expensive. Tobacco too, but I feel that's justified (~10 bucks for a cheap pack in Montréal currently).
I know quite a few people who simply brew their own beer, and give it out to friends. :P

Gosh, I really need to move to where beer is cheaper. It's not uncommon to pay 6 CAD (plus tip!) for a *Heineken* at bars.
Ten bucks (tax included) at the corner store for a six pack of *decent* beer on sale, and eight for the cheapest Pabst six pack on sale.

That's hilarious.

I sold my 4 BTC about a year ago after they climbed out of a crash, when they were $350.
I've made a huge mistake.
