Why so slow? I always pay by bank transfer (live in the UK) and it's usually pretty quick.

You realise that they only have lower fees and faster transaction times because they have fewer people using them right? 
The problems that Bitcoin face now would affect all cryptocurrencies, *if* they were as heavily used as Bitcoin is. It's the fundamental nature of the design. 
Sure, you *can* increase the block size but that doesn't help in the long term, as more capacity simply means that more people will make transactions that they otherwise wouldn't bother with.
The true solution is something along the lines of Lightning Network.

Right but again, Bitcoin Cash has not solved the problem. All it's done is pushed it back a bit. If the cost goes down the level of transactions will likely increase dramatically, as happens at present in the real world with roads - as you add more and bigger roads, more people start driving on them. 
The solution is layer 2 solutions, *not* block size increases, which only serve to create more centralisation, which is bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:56
Precisely this. Some people think Mint is better than Ubuntu, and others think the opposite. The difference is Mint wins on its own merit, whereas Bitcoin Cash is largely relying on the Bitcoin brand to push itself forward.
Sure, you might think BCash is superior to Bitcoin on a technical basis, but I don't think anyone is claiming that it's superior, objectively speaking, to the other alt coins out there.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:47:28
A thousand times this. The level of shilling from BCH supporters in this thread is insane. 
Though it is true that BCH uses larger block sizes right now, the reality is that it is in many ways actually an inferior currency. All they've done is delay the problem - if BCH saw the same level of transactions as Bitcoin the same problems would start to appear very quickly. Not to mention that the additional capacity would likely just encourage more people to start trading more frequently, using up what additional capacity is there. You can increase the block sizes, but all that does is increase centralisation down the line.

Sorry, got a source on them being hard coded? I ask because nothing I use talks to the root name servers at all. Quick example - I set up a name server on my router, that then asks for the name servers to query for addresses it doesn't have locally, so I give it my ISPs ones. They can then go and query whatever's above them.
It's true that they are primarily used as caches, but it's absolutely possible to add your own addresses to them if you wanted to, and there's no technical reason that others couldn't do the same. 
With that said, it's also perfectly justified to be opposed to this way of working, and as such one should also be opposed to the way in which BCH is trying to centralise the currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:14:11
A thousand times this. When I saw the drop I was initially scared, but then I thought, if I was in a position to buy more, I totally would right now. 
I just wish I'd bought some alt coins so I could trade them back for some cheap bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:45:40
That isn't centralisation by any means though, because the vast, vast majority of internet users, are going to be only ever communicating with other name servers that replicate from other name servers another level up the tree.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:40:28
Thing is, Bitcoin cash doesn't solve the fundamental problems with Bitcoin. All they've done is increase the block size, which doesn't fix Bitcoin or do anything of the sort. All it does is delay the inevitable.
Even with the 8MB block size of Bitcoin cash, there's still nowhere near sufficient capacity to take on say, Visa level of transactions. All it does is make centralisation more likely, which any true supporter of Bitcoin should oppose.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:00:33
To be honest I don’t see why bitcoin needs to replace PayPal, visa etc, at least in the short to medium term. No-one is complaining that gold is difficult to make transactions with. 
Regardless, the solution is absolutely not bigger block sizes. The real solution is layer 2 solutions.

In fairness South Park has always been political - this is nothing new.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:53:00
I will hold onto said bitcoin for a stupidly long amount of time and then do nothing with it. By giving me a bitcoin you can ensure that I will have a bitcoin for a rather long time. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:17:39
Certainly optimistic. The UK getting ready to leave and making a total mess of it has certainly put others off considering it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:17:20
Except for the whole thing of having elected MEPs and all that.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:52:34
I'm surprised by the circle jerk against the show on Reddit to be honest. I wouldn't call myself a fan of the show but equally I don't really understand the constant bashing. Sure, it's hardly an example of some incredibly intelligent comedy but people watching it aren't looking for that. It's something reasonably lighthearted that you can almost just watch in the background.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:38:15
I did but I'm now debating selling it for BTC now that it's at its all time high and BTC is at a low. Not to say I wouldn't buy more BCH in the future, depends on what the market does.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:59:59
You're thinking of Bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:09:25
Madness but don't worry about it - you'll get used to the mad fluctuations that come with cryptocurrency. 
Bitcoin is a strong currency - remember to buy in when it drops, even if it's terrifying, and sell when it's at its ATH, or indeed, just HODL because supporting Bitcoin is genuinely important.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:36:15
A thousand times this. The effect to the price of BTC and BCH won't be realised for some time, in part because of the huge backlog of transactions. This will clear eventually - be patient and don't make any crazy decisions just yet.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:02:49
Very true and something I hadn't considered. Many people are adopting bitcoin, not because it's the perfect currency for small everyday transactions, but because in many cases it's a better bet than one's own currency for a store of value. This does not have to be a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:43:11
A thousand times this. I haven't used an exchange in a very, very long time but it was only used as a very temporary hold.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:50:15
Why not buy up again now during the dip and hold all over again? Even more profits to be made!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:35:21
A thousand times this. I've really never understood why they did that - why do they need girlfriends?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:26
It's crazy isn't it?
I've always found it mad really - people see a dip so they start selling because they panic. Meanwhile others use it as an opportunity to buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:30:23
Precisely this. 
Bitcoin fluctuates all the time - it's had some pretty massive drops before and it'll have some in the future as well I'm sure. At the same time, I'm optimistic that Bitcoin will continue to perform reasonably well with any luck.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:52:59
I can confirm that I was attracted to this subreddit by the wizard. Admittedly I already knew about Bitcoin but it was the wizard that made me laugh and come over to take a look.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:35:17
Keep in mind though that not every Bitcoin address is segwit enabled yet. In my experience if you're sending / receiving to wallets using segwit BTC is actually very fast.
Also keep in mind that whilst the amounts in dollars were very close, that doesn't reflect the actual number of transactions, which is the important thing. I reckon there's a good chance they could be wildly different between the two currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:53:59
Yeah I don't really get it either. The Big Bang Theory isn't exactly some intellectual comedy but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be something nice and positive one can watch when they want to relax and don't want to have to think too much. 
I wouldn't call myself a fan of the show but I find it ridiculous that people would bash others for enjoying it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:48:18
Interesting - I just tried (UK) in a private browsing window and the first result for me is Bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:10:45
Yeah I completely understand it - I'm mixed because on one hand I absolutely can see how it's effectively blackface for autistic people, but on the other hand I honestly do get a kick just out of how I can almost see a "worse" version of myself reflected in Sheldon. Granted I haven't watched the show in quite a few years now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:14:56
Don't worry too much about what happened in the past. I regret selling my 0.6 BTC that I had a few months ago for well, less than it'd be worth now, and I know someone who certainly regrets not holding the BTC he bought at £8 a few years ago.
Just remember to hold now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:56:32
So in that basis do you consider the United States government illegitimate?
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:11:28
In fairness I actually agree with this and I think this is precisely the problem a lot of the critics of the Big Bang Theory have - they're expecting it to be something that it's not. 
I genuinely think it's a fairly enjoyable sitcom where you don't have to think too much and can just relax and enjoy the ride. I just dislike the need for everyone to be paired up I guess when I can't help but feel like some of the characters make more sense to me single, but then what do I know.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:51:35
You don't need a very high fee right now at all though - I've had things confirmed within a matter of minutes on absolutely tiny fees recently, and I'm not even on a segwit wallet yet.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:36:05

Personally I'd take the BTC with the caveat that I'd still convert it into GBP for every day living. 
Much as I'd love to keep it in BTC fact is most companies don't accept it yet (props to those that do) but I'd rather keep it in BTC, not even because I care about hodling or future gains, just because I genuinely want to support crypto and this seems like a pretty decent way to do it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:40:20
Well I mean, as much as I love bitcoin myself, I wouldn't tell someone to buy it if it's just a get rich quick scheme for them.
Many people on here have done very well buying bitcoin, but who knows what it'll do tomorrow? Personally I'm genuinely optimistic for Bitcoin myself, but equally I wouldn't dare suggest someone else blindly invest if it's money that they wouldn't want to potentially lose.
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:19:21
I use Bittylicious. No idea if it's the cheapest but I don't really care - I just love how ridiculously convenient they make it. You say you'll buy some BTC, they find a broker, you send them money via bank transfer, Bittylicious sends you BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:47:07
Yeah part of me wants to buy back in, the other part knows from experience that literally the moment I do it'll drop 10%.
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:05:25
Worth it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:23:47
No worries, I'm sure many here will gladly buy your BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:45:29
Yeah was my immediate thought. I've paid much, much less than that, even when not using Segwit, and still had transactions confirmed within minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:08:58
Agreed and essentially I'd wager it's because they almost see Windows as a sort of legacy product at this point. It's not exactly a secret that Microsoft were considering a full rewrite at one point, but ditched it because it likely wouldn't've proved profitable.
My guess? They're pushing the UWP apps because it would allow them to build an entirely separate OS to run them in the future with much of the legacy cruft removed.

To be fair, if I was running the pineapple fund, as hard as it'd be, it'd probably be for the best to not admit it to friends and family. Next thing you know they're asking for a cut.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:53:48
Haha yup, though they still catch me out.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:04:04
I haven't in part because having to find someone on there who'll accept me with no track record and actually go through contacting them and sorting it out seems a lot harder than just going onto Bittylicious, putting in the amount I want and doing it. I'm aware that I could probably get a better rate on Localbitcoins, but the rates on Bittylicious aren't at all bad and it's worth it for me for the convenience. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:52:26
Thanks for linking these - I knew of Singularity but the rest is new to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:39:24
Yeah absolutely. I'm pretty pro-BTC, I'll definitely be back in, but I'm going to sell for now and buy back in once it drops.

EU citizens are, for the time being at least, treated exactly the same as British citizens at the border. That is to say, they present a passport or identity card and are let in without any questions. 
With that said, will this change after Brexit? It's honestly impossible to say at this point. Nobody really seems to know. There's a lot of talk but nothing meaningful has happened yet as far as negotiations go so it's hard to say what will actually happen post-Brexit.
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:22:23
Not the US but I live in the UK and what I've learned from my international friends' experiences is that the treatment in the UK varies, with every extreme from they said nothing and let me in with no hassle at all to they detained me for several hours and went through my laptop and online accounts.
Seems to depend on who you get on the day and what (however insignificant) things they may decide to pick you up on.
