I don't think that was a real trade. I am guessing that is a broker(like Plus500) manipulating the price for a short time. This way all traders with call-options on BTC will have their stop-losses hit(profit for the broker). Quite a bad thing that prices are so easly manipulated.
Edit: it was a real trade ofcourse, but with a evil plan behind it

That does not matter, these options are based on the BTC price. They are written by the broker. They just follow the price of BTC. So they don't act on the market itself.

I'm beginning to like these guys. I have to admit that the social network hurt their image pretty bad on my part. It shoudn't have, since the movie was obviously colored but it did. I

He could do a wire transfer, there would be fees involves but nowhere near 4,6%.. (more like 20$/40$) With this he has bought buyer protection from paypal since you could, in such a transaction, add a contract or document that states the products or services you bought.
I see that it is expensive but doing it with bitcoin isn't the same thing at all.
