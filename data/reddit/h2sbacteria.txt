In fact Iran should embrace virtual currency as an F U to the incumbents. If enough of these oppressive regimes did that currency would be free and the regimes would all lose control of the economic aspect of their countries and so would the imperialists who are looking to destitute the nation with sanctions in hopes of causing a rebellion that they can then exploit to overthrow the regime.

"Price stability: A situation in which prices in an economy don't change much over time. Price stability would mean that an economy would not experience inflation or deflation. It is not common for an economy to have price stability."
virtual currencies "do not pose a risk to price stability, provided that money creation continues to stay at a low level"
So they are worried that they no longer can cause inflation or deflation in the economy to control it... which would cause capitalism to collapse.

I don't think my feedback was not constructive. I don't have any specific suggestions. But the fact remains, when you are directly charging money for people downloading files that are apparently illegal you are going to get in trouble for it sooner or later. The megaupload model was better because they could argue that they were not charging for the actual product, but for simply the cost of bandwidth. This project can make no such claim. So my constructive criticism would be to study the other models and design something different that actually has a chance of longevity rather than doing the same thing that has already failed with bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-10-29 18:06:50


So is any currency, especially one which does not have any force or coercion backing it. The fact that it is an avenue for any of these things is a testament to the fact that it does in fact have value.
Anything is worth anything because someone else wants it, that's what gives anything value. The reason gold was good for it was because there was a limited supply of it and it was difficult to produce more of it and so it goes for buttcoins. 
Fiat currency is no different than buttcoin other than the fact that a government forces people to accept it to settle debt. But if people already agree to settle debt using anything than a government is not needed... and it's still as good and as useful as anything else.
@_date: 2012-11-05 03:40:05

No it wouldn't... If you have a billion dollars you can cause volatility in the currency to no end. In effect making it unusable. They did something similar to gold by keeping its price depressed until recently.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:45:17
I don't want to convince the bitcoin community of anything. The coin community does not have to agree upon value, they can determine it by trading. All that it's introducing is a intrinsic value. For the US dollar it used to be gold, until they abandoned it. For the rest of the world the currency is the USD which is used as the reserve currency of the world. There are already banks that peg their currency to the USD.

That's mostly because they see American seigniorage as unfair. They also don't like the way America does not take responsibility for its actions instead passing on its economic problems to other people through the currency; i.e. if you hold our currency you have to pay for the mess we have made.

At that point you put a provision that says that if the current currency used as the peg becomes unstable, etc, then the coin automatically switches to a different reserve currency that is most favoured by the world. There would be disagreement about this that would be resolved at the exchange automatically. As all the blogs and the coin punters would declare this to be the case and try to trade the coin for a different value and if those trades go through a new peg currency would be defined for the coin.

Considering it's a bank and considering that access to your money is a human rights issue. It's not a simple service, it's a very specific type of economic service that is necessary for people to exercise their basic human rights to employment. If a government seized your money and would not give it back it would be a massive political issue -- and so is this and it needs to be taken to the Supreme Court as a human rights issue.

Power at its root is derived from physical force (ie. military) and the ability to use it to enforce legislation. At any point the government can introduce legislation to ban Bitcoin outright and there is nothing the people can do about it. It already does this with gold. If you have gold they will come take it from you. So though you might believe this, the chances are very very small that there will be a point in the future where they have no ability to impact it. That the value will grow so large that they won't have enough fiat money backed by real force to buy it outright if they wanted to. It's a nice thought, but it's a dream more than a reality.

Sure some volatility might exist and that can be sorted out at an exchange. But that would be very small and very weather-able to those that want to use the coin for commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:08:51
It's stupid to try to peg something as arbitrary as bitcoin to the dollar. You need to create another coin that has as its agreed upon value as pegged to dollar. That way there is no need for a player to enforce this, there is already a general idea that it's pegged to a dollar. The only disagreement is about the exact value of it which would be a very small amount of volatility... which would they be worked out at an exchange...

About your second point about it recentralizing things. I guess there are some dogmatic Bitcoin users who think that Bitcoin has some sort of potential to change power dynamics -- this is a pipe dream. Any central bank at any time has more than enough money to introduce volatility in Bitcoin at any time. Therefore it's already centralized as an external party has control over its value and therefore its potential for trade. This is about controlling their ability to impact it.

Bitcoin has a digital public registry that holds all the information for who has what. Your bank holds a digital private registry of who has what. Either method is using an electronic database and all transactions are accounted for electronically.
There really isn't a difference. It's all data about who has what which is exchanged and denotes an agreed upon value whose exchange value with other value instruments is set by a market.

Yes but where does the USD come from, it's not as if banks will trade bitcoins for USD. The company giving out the USD has to either have it from other customers who want the bitcoins or has to put up the money itself.

1) There is nothing to do... You mine coins as usual. There is plenty of data publicly available that shows the amount of currency in circulation and the value of the coin is tied directly to the amount of currency in circulation and the current trading price of the currency.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:01:58
There is a simple formula which determines the value of a coin as $X dollars which includes a variable for the current exchange rate and the supply of the currency -- say m3. Everyone agrees upon the formula as a formal spec when the currency is created and people start mining it.

Banks don't "invest". They borrow money using a credit window from either the federal reserve or other banks at a discount rate and lend it to home owners at a premium after doing their "due diligence". When the due diligence doesn't pan out the government eats up the loss of the bankruptcy... or they go running to the government for hand-outs etc.
Yes small time investors can do what you want. But when they blow up they lose all their money... which seems like a fair deal. They don't play a significant role in this game though. Essentially the system is set up to let a few people who get lucky have this much capital to play with... But they then have them on a pretty tight leash to make sure you contribute to the economy in a positive way or you lose all of your capital.

It's not really a system, it's a systematic method of siphoning profits from those who make them and putting them in the pockets of those who hold money. By disrupting the system, they mean they will no longer be able to siphon off other people's labor while keeping those people in perpetual indentured servitude.
To see this more clearly think about a house. A house gets built by borrowing money. It then gets sold for twice the sales price, which goes to the pocket of the capital holders. So for doing absolutely nothing other than making two entries in a database these owners have transferred 1/2 of the wealth generated through house building to their pockets.
The employees who build it get enough money to carry on for another month. The developer gets enough profits to invest in his next project. The holders of capital get a bunch of free money for doing nothing. They don't even take the risk. If it defaults, the government pays for it which means it comes out of the pocket of existing holders of currency or tax payers.

Because they are simply processing transactions of their customers. Not trying to control every aspect of their lives. Assuming their customers are innocent before being proven guilty.


All the major banks can join them in the celebrations. As well as the CIA. I would love to see their CEOs go to jail for what was admittedly money laundering. I would also like the government to cease their funds and shut them down. In this case it's simply an accusation without any proof, leading to a prison sentence and destruction of a private business.

yeah i think the lines became blurry/irrelevant when fiat currency was invented. ultimately it's a promise to pay and it can be denoted however you want. it's debt. and yes all of those systems can be used to move that debt around. digital currency is just moving that debt around digitally and those systems do that.
a dollar is an iou to the central banks that is then circulated using either paper money or digital forms.
so is a debit or credit card digital currency? well depends on what you mean, yes it has the ability to move around ious from different parties digitally denoting whatever currency that the card is issued in. and any other system does the same thing including bitcoin.
