I think you don't have it enabled. 
From the security page I can't tell mine is enabled or not, but if I don't give a 2FA it won't login.

With Google the contingency plan is to use printout backup codes and/or phone number when 2FA was first enabled. However some sites don't provide these options so backup the QR code.

In my country, Canada, it takes two pieces of identification with address and an entire day to buy gold. I need to drive in town, go to the basement vault, wait, and hope price didn't jump up.
I suspect the same for bitcoin. You can always buy blackmarket, and bitcoins are easier to trust.
