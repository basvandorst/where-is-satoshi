Why will bitcoin be more stable with futures? Sorry, I see this a lot, and would appreciate an answer.

1 and 2 have always been true (before futures). But I do think bitcoin is probably more stable now than 2013.

I'm not a trader by profession. What does it mean to then enter a short position?  
He thinks the market will crash. So he tries to sell his contract and then goes to sleep?

I really don't follow. I think the volatility will go down due to higher volume though.

But he needs to find a buyer right to short the future position? Like on an exchange, you need to find a buyer to sell bitcoin?

"Why sell bitcoin futures if you're going to lose money?"  
I think this is a bad point, because you can literally buy a bitcoin and then make money off the future contract fee and interest risk free. I think this is called arbitration.

So we went through with segwit without a hard fork?

You sound like you really care about the enivronment. Bitcoin mining is actually fairly damaging.
This 2013 [article]( says it was 150k a day of electricity. It's scaled exponentially since. Not to mention the computing resources could better be used for solving science problems. The largest distributed computing centers in the world have nothing on a bitcoin mining group.

Netflix does not own the nodes for your savings. They rent different machines from Amazon or at least different virtual machines.

I never thought about it from an energy perspective as a comparison to the existing infrastructure.
