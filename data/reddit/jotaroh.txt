@_date: 2014-01-24 20:51:47
Well that depends on the merchant.  For a merchant that doesn't do much traffic $30/month is acceptable, they don't need the support that a bigger merchant like Tigerdirect would need.
If a merchant is putting through a lot of transactions, the transaction % fee is quite significant.  Much more than $3000/month.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:19:33
Merchants prefer cash/bitcoins because they don't have to pay a cut of the transaction to the card networks for a credit card transaction.
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:13:01


boom and bust?  wut?
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:47:22
Tigerdirect did $250k in 17 hours.  3% of that is $7500 already.  That is in addition to other fees that Tigerdirect is paying to the payment processor for similar types of service support they are paying their payment processor for accepting visa/MC.
As you scale up you will save a lot of money due to the % payment model of credit card transactions.
For smaller merchants, they don't need the $3000 services, they could do well on $30 option.

I'm not a bitcoin investor or speculator, I see a lot of value in being able to make digital payments without having to involve the card networks
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:44:20
The credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard) don't issue credit.  They just maintain the transaction networks between banks so that payments can happen.
The banks that issue credit cards are the ones that provide you with credit.
The credit card companies that maintain the card network ofcourse will take a fee everytime a member uses their network to do payments.  Bitcoin could ofcourse eliminate the need for this network since Bitcoin is the network.
The elimination of transaction fees would ofcourse be very appealing to merchants who currently have to pay 2-3% for every payment they take depending on the credit card.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:02:33
merchants DO care what they get paid in.  They'd rather take bitcoins, or carrots because their payment processor won't charge them a transaction % fee.
that's the point
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:14:47


Internet memes?
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:09:26
I thought it was very interesting.  Usually the bigger merchants like Walmart can get a lower MDR vs some mom and pop shop.  Apparently it wasn't low enough which is a shock.
Which leads directly to bitcoin which offers much lower fees and may be attractive to a large volume merchant like Walmart.  All of those little cuts add up to a lot.

@_date: 2014-01-24 20:36:15
I just checked Bitpay
There is no transaction % fee.  It's a flat fee depending on how much service you want with them.
With a credit card you pay a % of the transaction in addition to other fees.

Whether or not the government should even be in the business of insuring mortgage risk is another debate altogether - 
You say all banks were suffering a liquidity problem, yes that's what I've been saying.  Left to their own devices the banks would have gone insolvent because they had no cash to pay their bills.


Whether or not they made any money out of this I don't know but that's beside the point.  The whole point of it was not to make money (government buying motragages is not standard procedure), it was to pump cash into the system. 
As I say again it was a roundabout way of bailing the banks out.

I'd love any way to make a digital payment without the card networks.  
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:32:43
it's the chicken and egg thing ain't it?
Merchants have the incentive to get the ball rolling because they can save a lot of money on transaction fees they would have had to pay out to the card networks.  As well they can reduce fraud on credit card transaction.  The less the better.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:27:59
Canada has always been a follower and will always be a follower and is of no consequence.
The important battle ground is in the USA.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:50:22
There are no payment processors accepting carrots so what are you arguing about?
Merchants love taking payments in anything that is not a credit card because of the transaction% fees they have to pay.

thanks to bitcoin~!
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:10:29
credit card transactions have a 2-3% transaction fee for the merchant
I suppose he wants to pass some of those savings down to the consumer.  I think this is a great move and makes sense since there is less downside from the merchants side if the consumer makes payments using bitcoin - no fraud, chargebacks, instant settlement.

A Crown corporation buying that much mortgages is unprecedented in Canadian history.  If they did not pony up that cash, the Canadian banks would have liquidity problems hence insolvency.
Yes businesses needed loans but there was a liquidity crisis hence the banks could not lend. It was not business as usual.  That is why the Canadian government had to step in to save the banks.  
All of this seems like circular reasoning from you.  You claim there was no liquidity crisis because the Canadian government bought some assets off the banks.  This is basically a round about way of saying bailout.  Without the injection of cash game over.

Merchants prefer cash/bitcoin/giftcards because they don't have to pay a  massive transaction fee to the credit card networks.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:47:32
I don't see the point of Visa "accepting" bitcoin - what does that even mean?  What is the benefit there if the the transaction fees won't change for the merchant?
What merchants want is an elimination of transaciton fees and to do that they would need to adopt the Bitcoin network and bypass Visa altogether.
