It rose because it was never dead to begin with.

If they capitulate now and just copy BitcoinClassic they damn well don't deserve the consensus and I hope the community reacts by further supporting BitcoinClassic. The firing/ousting is upon us! 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:17:52
Why is taking control a problem? Classic is community based governance... Core just has Blockstream corporate goals dictating everything and ignoring everyone else... it is the most anti bitcoin situation ever. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:15:25
Yes, and they completely squarderd it by making corporate goals, Blockstreams goals... the only priority... and thus pissing off the entire Bitcoin community they are here to serve. 
It is like if the USA politicians publically sold the country to Walmart. And now Walmart is telling them what to do. At which point the population starts getting angry, fights back. In real life they'd all just get mowed down by Walmart Military. In the Bitcoin world we can actually oust the corporate team now in charge (Blockstream) and give the community what they actually want, Bitcoin for Bitcoin... not for Blockstream.

Than it has been declared! Who are we, but lowly Bitcoin community members, enthusiasts, programmers, companies, to dare question such a decree. Shame on us! lol =P

Sometimes positions need rotating, politicians, students, anyone gets fired/voted out, when the boss/whoever/population is not happy. People aren't happy with Blockstream now running Core. Consensus is now leaning towards doing just that with BitcoinClassic and that is okay.  Just like a decentralized open network should be able to do. Perhaps BitcoinClassic will have its time and they will get fired too. 
This should be an accepted, cherished, cheered for part of the process.

Politicians get fired, employees get fired, students fail the course, people that screw with the entire Bitcoin community for most of a year should get fired too. Why do they suddenly get to keep the job at the last second when they shit their pants in well deserved fear and see they've fucked everything up so bad? You reap what you sow. The Core devs shouldn't be immune to consequences and them giving in at the last possible second just to latch onto POWER is disgusting.

Gotta love the whole 'good at PR' thing. Great way to quickly dismiss an opposing party. No one at Blockstream with all that VC money is capable of PR for their Core devs? Hearn is gone but that makes no difference what people think of Blockstream running the show the way they have. And BitcoinClassics support shows people are done with Blockstreams agenda and ready to boot/fire/oust. 
One day BitcoinClassic, another, whoever, will likely have to deal with the same situation if they mismanage their time. It is a process that should be celebrated within this community. Countries become dictatorships if the population can't vote away their leaders, should Bitcoin become like that also? 
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:23:08
It truly is an exciting time! I haven't been this excited about the Bitcoin software itself in years really. The Blockstream devs mismanagement of their responsibilities has lead to this. Hopefully Classic will keep up the proper governance techniques... or it will be them to be ousted next! Just as it should be. 
No dev team should get to be permanent dictator over the community forever just because they like the power. If they are listening to the community, doing a great job, they should stay... otherwise we need to have the ability to fire. Classic being implemented will show the community it is possible and not so scary. In fact it should be cherished, cheered for, and embraced as a part of the open decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

This hasn't killed us, it has made us stronger. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:16:09
Because it has consensus is will likely be the new software going forward. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:45:08
Their motivation is millions of VC money for Blockstream... which they all work for... huge conflict of interest. BitcoinClassic has consensus now! 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:24:14
And Core should be usurped. They are getting fired for a reason, because their only priority is Blockstreams goals... no one elses. There 'throne' is Blockstream. It is a terrible situation for Bitcoin.
This firing process should be a celebrated, cherished process. Core fucked up in a huge way and now they are being fired. If BitcoinClassic does the same, they too will be fired. And the next team after that too. 
Do politicians, employees, students, get to remain in their positions  when they've screwed things up so damn bad forever... simply because they did a good job at some point. No! 
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:42:58
Only 120% consensus minimum! Overwhelming threshold is now 150% until increased down the line! 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:44:02
We must stick with them because they are our Blockstream corporate overlords! We must stick with our overlords under all circumstances! Even when they defy the wishes of the community, ignored the needs of the community, only do what benefits Blockstream and no one else! But even then, Blockstreams goals should be our goals! It is we, the users, miners, enthusiasts, programmers, community members, we are wrong! How dare we question the all knowing authority of Blockstream. We must stick with our overlords because because elections to boot out bad politicians and firing bad employees are bad and this would be the same! We are supposed to stay with those people forever. Dictators are good, and it isn't nice to fire employees who screw up really badly either, they deserve infinite chances.
Praise BLOCKSTREAM!

Pretty much nothing that involves humans ever has 100% agreement. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:10:46
No one expected Blockstream devs to stay around, that is what ousting is supposed to do. Many core devs will likely want to contribute to Classic and have a chance too, but Blockstream won't control the conversation anymore and won't do what benefits only them while ignoring everyone else. And if they don't want to contribute? Oh well... not like there is 7 billion people on the planet!!
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:54:29
I agree entirely. This is an election and a long needed one. 
This process of 'electing, ousting, firing' through consensus should be one of the most celebrated aspects of Bitcoin. No single team of devs should be able to get comfortable with their power and thumb their nose at the entire community, do what their own goals are exclusively, which is precisely what Blockstream has done.
One day, BitcoinClassic may have the same fate... and that should be celebrated too.

People were making predictions back in 2011 that it would bubble and correct over and over until it hit 100K + 
If they end up being true, a bubble to 10K would just be part of the process. Bubbles all the way there. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:59:59
Exactly, what a joke. We got a really great human being here. Oh the internet.

You seem to revel in your worthlessness to human society.
