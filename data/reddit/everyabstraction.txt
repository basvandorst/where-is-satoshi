Not a bad idea. Can't wait to see people pump and dump Bitcoin Iamverysmart Cash Gold!

This sounds like a perfect opportunity to start iamverysmartcoin. ICO? Anyone?

It seems ludicrous to me that in less than half a year Bitcoin has increased by an astounding ***$10,000*** from what I bought in at — and I had done so at a scary ATH so many people even in this sub were convinced was due for a major correction, plateau or crash. I feel lucky as hell, and I sure as fuck will continue to HODL.
Ten fucking thousand dollars. Not a theoretical "hurr durr if I bought in 2009 imagine how rich I'd be" but an actual *holy shit I did buy then.*

Will the headline include the words "is dead"?

Seconding the fuck out of this. For obvious reasons crypto stuff will always attract more STEM Master Race types but holy fuck is this shit goddamn cringey to see.

Only a matter of time before the coin price spikes up so much that it'll be commonplace to set the price at kilosats instead of full coins. Wouldn't be surprised if this starts happening before the decade is out.

Wait, WHAT. Donki accepts BTC?

Oh boy. A Trump voter still convinced he's gonna follow through with a campaign promise instead of just tweeting how it's all Lock-Her-Up's fault he can't get anything done.

That makes sense, I wasn't looking too hard, but good to know!

I bought a Steam game a couple of days ago, and I'm going to buy a .com domain soon. Bought in at $4000, I don't mind spending a little bit to support the use of BTC as a currency, it's not like I haven't already profited massively from it.

I just want this dip to last a little longer so I can get more bang for my buck when I buy tomorrow. Ah!
