The last 5 months every post you have made has been about Bitmain/Antminers - this is not a venue for advertising Antminers so give it a rest
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:01:44
Please stop shilling Bitmain products, every post you make relates to Bitmain. 
Advertisments are not appreciated within this sub.

Bitcoin is at the foundation of all altcoins and should be respected, coins like BCH should stop trying to harm Bitcoin with its false narratives and propaganda because if you harm Bitcoin you only harm the value of your own coin and all other altcoins. You also weaken the entire crypto-community. Its a very stupid game to play and ultimately acheives nothing
