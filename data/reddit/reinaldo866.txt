In my country (venezuela) you only need to match Bank account + Cedula (national credential ID, which is an unique number the government gives you, you are pretty much that number), but on the name you can add "Mr. Faggity Faggot McFag" if you want, or just have it named "Bob" and that will work, but national id + account must match

Real estate, I'd buy building or build new ones, or setup and found new small businesses, retailers, etc... that's a more profitable thing in the long term


No, having lived here my whole life I can tell you that owning land in this country is a gamble, there are only leftist politicians in the country, and you know those leftist fuckers love "giving back" the land to the "exploited farmers", you see there's a guy called "Lorenzo Mendoza", one of the wealthies in the country, he pretty much has a monopoly on food production, and he doesn't own land at all, he buys directly from farmers, owning land and being problematic for the dictator of turn means no money for you


Just like owning land, cocaine trade is a big gamble in this country, you need to have the army and the politicians in your pocket, stop bribing them or support the opposition and you'll be sent to prison, so no I would never go into those businesses, real estate it's where it's at, just build a mall, or buy buildings, rent them and you'll be living happily forever in this country, just keep away from RESIDENTIAL real estate, with the laws (Women and kids social protection bullshit) your building can be taken or invaded by "homeless families" and you won't be able to kick them out, this is how I see people laundering money in this country and even making legal money:
1. Restaurants/Retailers/Small businesses
2. Real estate (mostly malls or office buildings)
3. Banking (But this is for the super rich and you need pretty much to suck the president's cock to get a banking license, and this is only given to born-Venezuelan citizens)
So, if I had a few millions laying around in bitcoins I'd go for the banking route or I'd become a real estate developer, and just like that you're set for life without getting "too involved" or calling attention from authorities

First thing people does when in Venezuela and have bolivares, pay electricity &amp; water bills and internet, spend it all on food, and buy USD, believe me, Cryptocurrencies will not be used by average people, the country is ignorant in that aspect, my own mother an accountant doesn't even understand what cryptocurrencies are and who owns them or how to generate/have them, for her, if isn't printed/used by the government then it's most likely a scam, you have to understand this is the mentality of 90% of the country
