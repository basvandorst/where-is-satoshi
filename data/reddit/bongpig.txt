I completely agree. I told a close friend how much I have one night when we were drunk talking about our future plans. That friend has gone and told everyone he can and now I get asked about it by random people.
It's made me wiser though. I now have all my bitcoin on a hardware wallet in a safety deposit box at the bank....and I tell everyone that asks about it that that is where it is.

From what I understand, it reduces the number of bytes needed for a transaction to be placed in a block, therefore it reduces the fees and also increases the number of transactions that are able to fit in each block.
So overall the the 'cost' of a block remains the same, but it is shared between more transactions.

"Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference. But shorting is much riskier than buying stocks, or what's known as taking a long position."

You can start buying bitcoin anytime. Sign up to coinbase and start buying. 
Also if you want to mine easily now, sign up to nicehash. 
This will at least let you get some skin in the game while you do some reasearch and get to know things a bit better.

The market is very volatile and trying to pick when is the best time to enter is not really possible. There have been a heap of people on here commenting about waiting for a dip, but the dip never comes. It could come to tomorrow, it could come in 6 months when it dips from $15,000 to $12,000.

It's good to be critical of how you spend/invest your money, but why would you go and put money into something you clearly have a very limited understanding of....and then go on and call it a bubble that is going to pop. Frankly it's insulting to everyone here.
You really should go and study the tech that is driving bitcoin...and all crypto. Then you will understand why a lot of people are interested in it and why large institutions are now positioning themselves to jump onboard. 
There are plenty of places you can go and read about it, places where people have spent a lot of time trying to explain it in the most easy to understand ways. You will not find this info on Reddit as you do not know enough to sift out all the BS some people put out.

While older miners might be a 'negative investment' right now, when bitcoin goes to the moon it won't be. Gotta think long term.
