Yeah,  I understand that now.  I mainly want to learn about cryptocurrency and how to mine and what applications can be used for it due to doing ict as my college course as we are provided with hardware via the college for things such as game design but I do not want to download anything without proper knowledge on an expensive machine due to scams and other things

Hmm I've read some reviews which say it has worked for them and some thay have not, I'm looking into mining alt coins but wouldn't know where to start. With this app though I can see where you are coming from and I have my doubts but I'm willing to see if it works or not. I'll make an ipdate when I try withdraw I'm currently at 0.000657 btc

I never tried to fool anyone.. I never said it was 10% legit I just found the app on the appstore and decided to share it.  I do it on multiple devices because they all run seperate I don't know why I don't know how but they do. I'm sorry that I am not an expert and have only just started getting into cryptocurrencies but I would prefer constructive criticism instead of being told to fuck off. The other person that replied was helpful and helped me understand that it might not be a legitimate application and even helped with links which is helpful for me to learn about crypto,  telling me to fuck off does not help with my knowledge of it.

Through the app yes. Through my phone no. I have 3 devices running the app 2 s9's and one htc it doesn't mine through your phone but through cloud mining.  As I have stated I do not know if it is legit I was just posting the app as what I've been told is that it is.  I'm sorry that I was mistaken and got that wrong but I do not know everything about the app.

I have, the minimum withdrawal is 0.05 btc which takes a while to mine but did seem to work with atomic wallet but I'm not very experienced with bitcoin due to only being 17 so I'll do some extra research on it

I checked with my professor about it and he said it is not against the rules to do so as we are allowed to take these rigs home (I7 9700k and rtx 2060) but he just said I need to be careful as I will have to pay for repairs if anything is damaged

Thanks for your replies, could you message me or link some sites to get started with information and maybe some sites or applications that are able to get me started?

One thing though was I did recieve a slight fraction lower than 0.05 when i withdrew it was 0.049 something

You can enter your btc adress and withdraw to any Wallet that you would like. As I said I don't know if this is a legit app or not but that is what I am researching right now and will get back to this post on my conclusion

It doesn't mine using your phone, you buy hashing power from them and it mines through the cloud I can take a few screenshots and upload them to an image bored if you would like

But as I said I do not know for sure so I will do some research
