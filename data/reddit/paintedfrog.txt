The FUD is a good thing. Every time Bitcoin survives an attack (spam, FUD, propaganda etc etc) it proves its resilience. 
No Bitcoin worthy of the name will succeed without passing every test the world can throw at it
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:38:20
If you need a bigger blocksize right now, there's nothing stopping you from using BCH. 
It sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it too. You want *Bitcoin Cash* to have the biggest market cap, and the BTC ticker, and the majority of trading pairs. But those were gained by consensus, that's how this works. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:47:46
If you follow the charts, what we're seeing today is just a continuation of the same pattern it's been on for the past week or so. If it holds we'll see a short period (1-3 days) of consolidation at this support and then another sudden jump to $17k, consolidation, support and so on
If you look at the 1W chart, BTC looks primed for gains. It happened a couple days earlier than I thought, but the 1W and 1D had the clearest indicators imo.
But the main factor was the healthy pullback from the December mooning which gave investors enough time to accumulate sats at a discount. Everyone wanted it to happen, it happened, now back to business.
p.s. if you're new, be advised that shitcoins will bear the brunt of panic selling when BTC moves like this. The hyperspeculative stuff will bleed heavily because most smart people are just accumulating satoshis with them. So to keep the bottom line satoshi-wise, most sell to BTC when it's bullish. I personally try to dump my shitcoins ahead a big BTC movement because the market is so crazy. Good alts will likely outperform BTC longterm in terms of ROI this year, as they did in 2017, so I don't sell those.
Hope that helps

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:11:56


Yes. Did you even read OP? The issue is why Bitcoin is down today. "Bitfinex got subpoenaed for potential tether fraud" isn't a sufficient response, because that happened two months ago. The reason it's down *today* (operative word) is because this old news is being reported *today*. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:11:47
It has the best, most forward thinking developers in crypto, and the most ambitious objectives of any crypto. It backs up its stated objectives with tangible results. People with brains, power and money understand that. It hasn't survived 9 years of constant attacks by being the first. Do some research. Basic research. Read the Internet of Money, at least.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:10:08
Even though I'm a BTC maximalist I do think the public offering model, like the ICO model, as applied to a currency is very close to being a ponzi scheme in that early adopters and creators benefit exponentially more than later adopters. Favoring earlier adopters exponentially is a pyramidal structure, while not specifially being a pyramid *scheme*. 
In the case of Bitcoin, satoshi personally stands to gain the most from adoption, followed by adopters from earliest to latest. This is the conflict of interest that made Charlie Lee sell off his LTC. What is best for the currency should not be a 1:1 relationship to what benefits the creator the most.
I'm saying this as someone who holds at least 50% BTC always

@_date: 2018-01-09 01:46:20
I'm talking about the lack of consensus for a hard blocksize limit increase, which led to the BCH hardfork. If the limit would have been simply *increased*, then BCH would be redundant. But there was no consensus for that, thus the hard fork. Don't be obtuse by conflating SegWit with that.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:06:14
You're fundamentally misunderstanding decentralization. Everyone should be able to, and can, create their own currency. Open source protocols are governed by consensus, so they gain validity through adoption. You can make 1000 currencies, but if no one finds any value to them, youre wasting your time. Don't want it? Don't use it 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:57:06
He's also not stupid. Facebook is a platform, it makes no sense economically to create a proprietary crytpto. The coin would only have value within the facebook ecosystem, whereas with independent coins, Facebook would be gaining the external value accrued by that coin externally, as well as the additional value from use within the network. With a proprietary coin facebook would only get the latter.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:18:58
Consensus is a new way of operating that most people still find hard to accomodate. We need to subjugate our subjective opinions to what amounts to a market mentality. Consensus rules in an open source protocol. If you think BTC *needs* to do something *now*, keep in mind people have been predicting (and plotting) BTC's downfall for nine years running now. Not a single alt can do what BTC does. Not one.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:33:26
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:44:48
I don't understand your reasoning. The examples you gave are of centralized companies, so you are aware that the same thing can happen without decentralization. The examples are almost limitless.
The whole point of crypto is governance by consensus over centralized authority. It actually makes value *more* secure, not less, because a minority (like a CEO for example) can't exercise control over it. Decentralization is strength

@_date: 2018-01-24 02:18:30
Wow, this some entitled bullshit right here. Bitcoin is an open source protocol, not a new Apple product. The developmental process is wildly different than for traditional consumer goods, so demanding better UI before the foundations are secured is putting the cart before the horse and misrepresenting what Bitcoin is. 
If Bitcoin is to be done right, it will take time. This demand that Bitcoin magically become an idiot-proof working product overnight simply because hype is building is ridiculously myopic. Demand is ultimately an externality.
It's "If you build it, they will come", not "If you sell it to them, they will buy it"

Thanks for providing sources (I was hoping my q would prompt op to research instead of using the talking points). I know these quotes. I don't think they address the question as specifically stated though, which specifies *high* fees (only addresses the utility of a fee market, and "high" is subjective [fees were much lower at the time]). It is true that full blocks are seen as a positive feature.
The context here is important, though. There is a lazy conspiracy mindset prevalent here, where Core itself has some financial incentive to keep blocks small. Just pushing against that
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:55:13
"Effectively" doubles, not literally doubles. Yes, wallets have to step up and enable SegWit support, it's opt-in. If it were as simple as increasing the blocksize, consensus would have been reached on that already. But there are reasons to keep the blocksize at 1mb or smaller at present.

@_date: 2017-12-23 02:30:49
Yes, I see Andreas' idea of the "Decentralization of Truth" as a third way between the two ideological poles. Untethering truth from "objective authority" (including Satoshi) and promoting it as an effect of constantly reaffirmed market consensus. It is an idea that comports perfectly with the anti-authoritarian promise of cryptocurrency. In my opinion.

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:10:44
Well, that's what consensus is all about. "Watering down" speaks to your ideological approach. You can have your subjectivity, but it will only be powerful in sustained, non-hierarchical cooperation with others. Ultimately the market of ideas will subsume all dogma into itself, the power of centralized objective authorities will be diminished. A truth will need to be perpetually reaffirmed by all parties for it to remain valid. The block debate is just one element of this. We need to drop the us vs them mentality, it is unproductive and against the zeitgeist.

I did the same. You know, buy the rumor, sell the news. The news in this instance being Roger Ver outing himself as an out of touch goon on live tv :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:24:52
He's probably talking about the large number of coins tied up in inactive accounts, incl Satoshi's. A good amount of these are effectively out of circulation permanently. In that case, he could actually be correct. The actual circulating supply is definitely not represented by the number shown on Coinmarketcap, in any case.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:00:24
You'd have to prove malicious intent for it to truly be a scam.
If Ver truly believes that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and, by extension, that adoption of BCH is *beneficial* for its adopters, you can't argue that he is malicious, only that he uses deception to achieve that end. 
Does not meet the criteria of a scam
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:32:17

This is like saying the "rational voices" of Flat Earthism are being pushed out of the scientific community. There's no symmetry between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. One is Bitcoin; one is trying to counterfeit Bitcoin. Claims to the contrary are misleading, intentional or not. The end.

Ok bud.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:19:31
I think the more important point is that Satoshi's words are not binding. Bitcoin is FOSS. It's pointless to canonize him and turn his words into scripture. Whether he was right or wrong on whatever subject, I personally don't find it productive to refer to his writings on development going forward. They have sentimental value but no authority. Appeals to authority hold no power in a permissionless system, that's why Bitcoin has real value.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:21:14
The op simply demonstrates that the overwhelming majority rejects the name "Bitcoin Core" to refer to Bitcoin or BTC. Your reaction here is...incongruous
@_date: 2018-05-25 06:41:12
It's temporary. Happened to me last week, same message. It should thaw after a few days, but unfortunately your follows will probably be gone.

No one is saying you can't. The subject at hand is about the deceptive marketing practices of BCH's handlers. It is they who are trying to gaslight people into believing Bitcoin is called "Bitcoin Core". If you think Bitcoin Cash has potential, buy it. Or make an application for it. Put some skin in the game to make it more than just words, like the entities listed in the graphic did. Talk is cheap; bothsidesism is just empty rhetoric that does not reflect actual reality, and fittingly has little to no support on the ground. That is the point behind op.

And with that, I welcome you to my block list. Troll.

@_date: 2018-05-12 06:57:04
Ok, but there's no cause and effect there. There is simply no rational basis for referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core. It's simple gaslighting, meant to diminish Bitcoin by presenting it as a "version" of Bitcoin, equivalent to Bitcoin Cash. That symmetry is complete fiction with no purpose other than helping Bitcoin Cash appear legitimate. Whatever feud you refer to, trying to rename Bitcoin just doesn't follow.
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:50:19

Bitcoin Cash is just one iteration of an attack vector that will likely reappear in various forms for the foreseeable future. No one seriously considers BCH an existential threat, just a temporary nuisance. As for "delaying progress", I'd say that's the opposite of undeniable.

Yeah, that too. Liberalism/negative freedom as theorized by Kant, Hobbes etc was the ideology that grew out of the Enlightenment rejection of the divine right of kings.

@_date: 2018-03-11 20:11:31
It's fallacious because the supply cap is 21 million. If forking alone created valid Bitcoins, then the supply of Bitcoin would be infinite, making it worthless. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin alone determines what is a valid Bitcoin, all other attempts at validation are unilateral attacks on the network. Minority hardforks are altcoins by definition and practice.
Ps: Appeals to authority (Cobra) are another expression of unilateralism. Also just weak arguments in general.

@_date: 2018-03-10 19:58:25
Referring to altcoins as "Bitcoins" is a meaningless gesture. I'm saying you're advocating for Bitcoin's destruction, not positing a realistic means to that end. The cap will stay, 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, you're just spinning your wheels here.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:21:44

Really this is what it comes down to. As long as we understand that Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash there's no controversy. It's the claim that BCH is Bitcoin that im pushing back against. I don't think you are claiming the fork created more BTC but rather more of the undefined "Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:56:08

A rational response like that is not going to dissuade [He thinks he is freeing slaves, one dm at a time :) ](
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:46:33
It's not my definition. Consensus determines the valid chain. That's about as basic as it gets, and to dispute that is to either ignore or undermine a fundamental design principle of Bitcoin. Another fundamental principle is the supply cap. Disputing its validity undermines the possibility of Bitcoin having value. I don't make the rules, that's the beauty of it.
If your definition is subjective, it is simply dismissed out of hand as a unilateral attack. Only consensus can define or redefine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:08:14
Finding a network valuable doesn't make it Bitcoin, and forking doesn't create new Bitcoins. You make these assertions as if the network hasn't already been determined. Bitcoin does have essential parameters. Supply cap is an essential parameter, because removing it destroys the possibility of Bitcoin being valuable.

It's exactly how it works. There is an entire sub dedicated to the fallacious idea that every fork of Bitcoin is as valid as Bitcoin. It's called r/btc. Disparaging r/Bitcoin for refusing to submit to anti-Bitcoin propaganda and dilute Bitcoin is an obvious ploy to sneak validation of BCH through the back door. If you want to advocate for the overthrow of Bitcoin, simply do it in an anti-Bitcoin sub like r/btc or r/buttcoin. Problem solved.

Nano is Bitcoin minus the thing that makes it secure. 
Marketing has done a good job convincing nanobots that you can get something for nothing. But the reality is the feeless system is a tradeoff for security. Also, fast and free coins will be a dime a dozen going forward, and nano can't even support smart contracts. It's ridiculous to believe it is in the same league as Bitcoin, forget replacing it.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:35:36

@_date: 2018-03-11 20:34:40
You're the one making the case for infinite supply by saying all forks are equally valid. I'm saying the supply is capped at 21 million, which means there can only one valid Bitcoin blockchain. Don't misrepresent my position here. Minority hardforks are altcoins. That's a perfectly normal function in open source development, you just can't unilaterally pronounce them Bitcoins. Nothing about that means these altcoins can't have value in their own right.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:47:12
I feel like I've had this same exact argument like ten times in the past week, so forgive me for not wanting to go at length here. But, I didn't contradict myself. Hard forks need majority consensus, and the form of that consensus isn't predetermined, but itself determined by consensus. That's a messy idea but the closest thing to "objectivity" we can achieve with an open source protocol, as we have no external authority to make that determination. So that's my take. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:56:46
No, we don't simply get to choose the number. An infinite supply means the value of any amount of Bitcoins is 0. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin offsets unilateral attacks on Bitcoin, like the one you describe.

Well that's just how the cookie crumbled, dad. Cryptocurrency is currently a novelty with regards to purchases and merchant adoption. That's just reality, utility or not. Of course there were, and are marginal cases where crypto purchases are better, point still stands
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:52:24
The network structure is effectively irrelevant, and fast and free isn't a unique use case. Satoshi, who was clearly fixated on network security could've used a DAG for Bitcoin (DAG networks have been discussed since the 1970's), but chose blockchain. 
"Doing one thing better than anyone" is just a talking point. Steem and bitshares do the same thing and both have greater tx volume than nano.
Most cryptocurrencies will have a micropayment channel in 2019. And a game-theory based PoW settlement layer, which nano lacks, is what makes the network secure
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:18:37
Yes, even with all that. Got any more lame talking points for us?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:25:16
No, it's not my only criterion. In your theoreticals, 1 2 and 3 would be forks implemented with overwhelming majority consensus, so in each case the fork would be Bitcoin.
Long story short, if you want your hard fork to be Bitcoin, only consensus can do that. That's why Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:54:21
Because you have literally not a single reason to spend cryptocurrency at the present time. Not one. You don't "spend" cryptocurrency right now, you speculate on it. Spending is 100% novelty in 2018. Use a credit card for purchases, it is better in every way.

The siege mentality comes by closing off other viewpoints.

Right, my concern is more about inadvertently playing into this emerging talking point about Bitcoin's fees being low solely due to lack of use. Imo the way to push back is to be more rigorous in presenting information with all the relevant context, contributing factors etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:16:27
You say that like there is an alternative. Yes, trust is fundamental to a fiat-based economy. When a cryptoeconomy emerges, it'll be a different story. But for now, the reality is visa is the superior payment method. No point in pretending cryptocurrencies are viable alternatives to fiat in 2018. I'll *consider* spending crypto when merchant adoption reaches 25%

@_date: 2018-02-24 03:41:23
Honestly, if you've been around for as long as you say, you should be aware op is indistinguishable from boilerplate concern trolling. The typical "How I came to r/btc" posts all play out exactly like this thread. So pretty much you got what you asked for, even if inadvertent. Sorry for the harshness, but this is rampant.
If by chance you'd like to chat about Bitcoin and LN and the rest, I'd be happy to do that, just shoot me a pm. No judgement.

Bitcoin Cash isn't compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain. You can't send Bitcoin Cash to pre-fork Bitcoin wallets. It's not subjective. You can still send BTC to the original Bitcoin wallet from 2011, because BTC is backwards compatible. Because it's Bitcoin.
