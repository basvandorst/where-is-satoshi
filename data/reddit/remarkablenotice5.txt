This is the saddest thing I think of every day. Even if those dumb fucks put in 20 dollars and forgot about it they could have enough to buy a house by 2030. Something most of our generation will never be able to do. Me, I plan to buy a bank. So I go in a little bigger. But I know damn well a majority can afford to put in 20 bucks and forget about it. Even if it's 5 bucks a check 4 times. Or 2 dollars a check 10 times. They limit themselves with their fear

Thank you. Hopefully more become aware of this and start parking their value elsewhere like the rich of this world are doing today. All while leaving the poor uneducated to the sinking financial ship they were born into and are encouraged to stay on, despite the fact that the rich are parking their value in life boats because they're educated enough to not put their value on the same sinking ship.

Better example: Our grandparents made 6 grand a year, and their houses cost them 6 to 10 grad. Reasonably affordable. Our parents made about 30 grand a year and they could get a house for 30 grand too. Us tho, we're averaging 50 grand a year(100 if you're lucky), and our houses are running on average upwards to 500 grand for a 3 bedroom home to 800k for a 4 bedroom place. Want 5 bedrooms? Better be able to afford a million dollar 30 year mortgage. My grandma still has her 7 bedroom home with 3 acres of land she bought for 6 grand, 6 grand that she paid in full without a loan. How do you defend this? Fuck our kids they'll make enough to do a 50 year, 10 million dollar mortgage if they want a home?

The point is the usd is doing the same thing venezuala is, and collapsing in value at an increasing rate.  2008 speed us up from 2% to 8% yearly inflation with 10% of the debt and money printing speed we have today. Once the inflation catches up with the speed of money we're printing to keep up with the growing debt, then you'll be sorry if you kept all your money in dollars. And why do you think credit cards were created? That's how the rich dont keep their money in dollars. They use their black amex cards to buy everything they want, and then sell some shares to make the monthly payments on the cards. I work for a billionaire and interact with many others because of it. None of them keep their money in dollars. From texas oil taycoons, to silicon valley investors. I've yet to meet 1 billionaire who ever holds any value in dollars. Even 80% of the millionaires I meet hold none of their wealth in dollars. The rich know what's happening. Do like them and protect your wealth. Holding it in dollars is just playing Russian roulette, accept every chamber is filled with a pellet, followed by a bigger pellet, eventually growing to bullets that only get bigger with caliber per chamber, all shooting at you're purse of value decreasing it's purchasing power faster and faster.

If you bought 1 million dollars worth of venezuala  currency the same time as bitcoins all time high, you'd be down to 3 dollars in value. The point is the dollar is forever losing value, bitcoin is historically still growing more than it drops. I'll take an 85% drop after 1000% growth any day over a currency with exponential loss of value that is only increasing with time everday. My money is where my mouth is too, as all my income goes into bitcoin, the stock market, and gold. As well as any wealthy person out there. U think Bezo's keeps his hundred billion in fiat? Or Buffet? Nope. They don't even keep one percent of their worth in fiat. They convert when they spend, and they quickly move anything else they make off this value sinking ship the second they get it. Their every purchase is on limitless black amex credit cards that they sell shares every month to make the payments on. The average man can't buy 250k Berkshire stock, or 1500 dollar amazon stock. For a majority of this world who cant afford gold or get access to stocks, this is their only lifeboat. Hence why bitcoin is being used in venezual right now more than their own dollar. Because they are literally saving the value of their worth by getting it out of their currency in real time. Even with bitcoins puny 85% drop after it jumped 1000%

Yup, the dollar may never die. But it's inflation is permanent, and volatile. You think crypto is volatile? Compare it to the history of the dollar and the loss of its buying power. My grandma used to buy burgers for 10 cents and 25 cents for a full meal, my dad bought them for 25 cent and a dollar for a full meal. Me? Just one generation later I was buying burgers for 1 dollar as a kid and 3 dollars for a meal. Now as an adult I can't find a meal for less than 10 dollars, and on average cant buy a real sized burger like the ones I got as a kid for less than 5 dollars. Imagine what they'll cost in the next 30 years, 30 to 50 dollars for a burger a 100 dollars a meal? That's why we're buying bitcoin. Not to make insane amounts of money, but to protect the value of what we have now from the inflationary dollar. Because our measly 10 dollars for a meal doesnt seem like a lot now, but that value, if protected from fiats inflation, will be worth upward of 100 to a thousand dollars by the time we retire with the inflation we're expecting from this massive debt. So no, we're not investing to be rich, we're investing to escape the financial collapse of the dollars value. Yes that doesnt mean the dollar will die, it just means it will keep getting worth less and less over time. And if you look at the pattern that inflation is rising in speed as our debt goes up. The 2008 recession bumped us up to 8% yearly inflation from the 2% yearly inflation our grandparents had. And our parents national debt was only 10% the size of what we have today. Getting rich will just be a side effect of putting the value of what we have today away from the exponential yearly increasing inflation we have on the dollar that's pegging up the world economy today. The bigger we let this debt grow causing us to print more money to keep up;  the faster it will accelerate in los of value. 
When they start saying we need to bring back bigger Bills like 1000 dollar, and 10,000 dollar bills, that's when it will get ugly and be too late to save your value significantly. That's what started the value decrease that started the great depression, that's what Madur0 did in Venezuela that caused their insane collapse in value where 1 million dollars in their currency 1 year ago is valued at 3 dollars today. Look it up, they added a 0 to their currency, multiple times, and now they are so worthless they have their currency littered on the street. Also why we got rid of our 1000, and 10,000 dollar Bills. Our economic managers(the fed) saw this and tried to fix it. But the guys that saw that historical connection and did that are now dead, and the chimps they warned about climbing that dangerous latter(printing more money at a faster rate &amp;/or adding a 0/s to our bills) are in charge it now. They are also dying out &amp; failing at spreading this warning to the next generation who will be in charge. Not to mention our orange turd in chief who keeps telling the fed to just print more money. With those dominos lining up, then it's only a matter of time before the 1000, and 10 thousand dollar bills come back along with the inflationary consequences that come with it, hitting the purchasing power of our dollar painfully.

College tuition, housing, cars. All major sectors of us lending increase by 8%+ yearly. Everytime a loan gets made more us dollar get made. By these sectors and more going up more than 8% every years, causing loans/ dollars to get printed every year, then on average the dollar inflates 8%+ every year. Most real analyst structure their readings by this. It's also mathematically sound. Ignore it all you want, but a majority of major expenditures increase by 8%+ every year, making your dollar worth that much less every year. But keep judging your dollars value by the dollar menu, sure that will work out well for u

My first purchase/sale was at a bitcoin atm. Felt shitty swapping the digital gold for devaluating cash. Bought it back as soon as my replacement bank cards came back in the mail. Which was also the reason I had to go to an atm. Because losing my wallet left me without cash from my bank. So the fact that I still had access to my funds despite my bank being shit was a good feeling. Tho selling my btc for shitty cash was not haha 
That said, I'd be happy to use my btc anytime I can to support vendors. You can be damn sure I'll buy back the spent btc right after though.

Everyday Joe's not going to use an exchange, nor is the grandma who refuses to use a computer. It will be good for exposure to the market for those types of people. Millions of people will cash out change as they regularly do, and those millions will now have the option to exchange their change for bitcoin. Imagine how those everyday joes will feel when they exchange 10 to 100 dollars in change for bitcoin, then see that small amount they put in become worth thousands one day? I'd reckon they soon learn, or find someone who knows how to use bitcoin to cash out, or invest more after they see that.

Parts would be the way to go. I recently bought a used miner for 200 bellow market value, an S9 for the purposes of figuring out how many I could run under my solar panels while keeping the bill negative. Damn thing came with a loose heat sink rattling all over. Sent it back for a replacement and the fuckers sent me back the same damn miner thinking I wouldn't check the serial number. Filed a claim with amazon and thankfully got my money back(Don't buy from alienantminer; guy sells heat sink loose miners from his clients mining operations). So now I got a broken miner for free at least, going to have my tech guy open it up and attempt to soder the heat sink back in place and see if he can fix it. Because if we run it in this state then we will cause the thing to burn itself, that's if it already hasn't been burned with their guaranteed 48 hours testing of the unites prior to selling to make sure they work. After this experience, I'm only buying them new at market price. Not worth risking my investment on a miner that will only work for a little while before burning itself out because of a loose heat sink. Feel bad for all the people leaving positive reviews not knowing their about to burn their miners before they make an roi because they don't know how to check for these things.

Even the poor, like my grandma for example, get's sent her pension to Mexico every month from my pops here, has been doing it since before I was born. Western union has made thousands from those monthly paychecks. You don't think they complained my whole life how much it cost just to send money? Shit paypal themselves take away hundreds of dollars everytime I get a payment for my work. If I could convince my clients to pay me through crypto it would save me thousands in a year for what they take. Just in the last 5 years paypal has made 10 grand out of taking money from payments sent to me.

There is, and I admit that. Though with how many people are interested in it, and the size of these companies wallets, there's a much higher chance of success than death. It's only a waiting game now. The big guys are scaring everyone to panic sell so they can keep buying without increasing the price on themselves, it's a math game, the more people sell, the more they can buy while having it to continue to go down, then when it dips to their magic number, then they move in big. It happens in every market. You think trillion-air investing firms get to where they are buy buying at market? Nope, they always tank it before they move in. Just look at how all our monopolies were created today, during the 2008 market crash when everyone sold their buisnesses/stock for pennies on the dollar. Don't let yourself be the fool selling to them for pennies on your dollars.

3k would follow the 2014 drop,  it's what me and all my colleagues have been instructing our clients to wait for.  A 2.5k-3k range for their big moves. We've still had them buy little amounts on the way down,  but we have them waiting for that range for their billion dollar moves to be triggered. I've been saying this since summer time,  but everyone here is always too emotional to hear it out so they downvote it as im sure this comment will be. Their other move is to use spelling errors or typos to attempted and discredit the analysis and help make themselves feel correct.  Well,  feeling correct doesn't change reality does it? They can go ahead and play by emotions,  but I'll stick to market pattern. After all, I wouldn't be employed if I didn't. You can't prove anything in the physical world without a historical reference; Science 101. Financial analysis isn't an exact science,  but it science never the less.

Supply and demand. Market cap is the demand here, btc is the supply. The big guys are buying, but their creating fud at the same time to get all the morons to sell off. The more the morons sell off, the more they can buy at a cheaper price because they can calculate purchases to a level that keep the market cap getting lower, which drops the price. they have huge amount ready to buy in, but it's at a certain price lower than we are today. It's what they did in 2008 to the stock market(dropped all the buisnesses they wanted to acquire to a crippling level, that way they could buy them Into their monopolies for pennies on the dollar), what they're doing here now. It's a known strategy in the field. Meanwhile the muggles freak out and sell off their hard earned coins for a fraction of what they paid for to the giants causing the drop in the first place. I hope 1 day the muggles learn, but my Hope's arnt high. Until then then we must play the king game with the giants buying at their marks

It all depends on when we hit the 87% floor, after that we'll see a slow climb back up start. And as you know, hitting that 87% floor could happen in a single day in this market, so dont count on any predicted time frame. But if I had to give you something, I'd say around 100 days at worst.

I've tossed in around 5k in value, most of the last 4.5k this year. Thanks to the 500 I tossed in a couple years ago I'm still technically profiting �� my OG 500 is holding up the massive losses on my recent 4.5k move. I ain't touching shit though, in fact, I have another 20k set aside just to keep moving in slowly during these drops. My big moves are planned for if we repeat the 87% drop of 2014, then I flush most of it in when that pattern hits(around 2.5k-3k range). If it dies when that happens then fuck it, if it lives, then this will be the most awesome experience of my investing career. It's also what all my other colleagues are doing too, and they are way older than me with 10× the capital set aside, and years ahead of me in investing experience with the same movement strategy. We're all analyst by profession too, so you can probably bet other professional investors have similar plans. I suggest you all set aside a "willing to lose fund" for this move too if you want to follow our strategy and buy according to market pattern. I'm sure I'll get a bunch of downvotes, &amp; hate comments responding to this saying market history is not a sign of the future, and you can listen to them if you wish. I mean, it's not like we invest professionally for a living or anything.
 But You Know what they say,  when everyone is crying and yelling **SELL** is when u want to buy,  and no one is yelling sell yet,  we're still in the optimistic hodl psychological phase of a market drop.  But you can bet all those no below 5k predictors will be yelling bloody murder when they see that unimaginable 87% drop we saw in 2014 that made them all cry sell back then.

The fact that you don't know of the hassle of banking in mexico and america makes me realize you don't know shit about Mexico. They make it hard on purpose because of the mass money laundering that goes on in Mexico with the cartels.

Idc, it was a small gamble. If bch does die, then fuck it. Same shit I said when I put a couple grand in bitcoin 9 years ago. Better to play and have lost, than have not played at all. If you live by the never play mindset, you lose a ticket to every train that does make it.

La Migra!!! Run!! 
Editing in for visibility incase it helps anyone wondering what to do rn:
I've tossed in around 5k in value, most of the last 4.5k this year. Thanks to the 500 I tossed in a couple years ago I'm still technically profiting �� my OG 500 is holding up the massive losses on my recent 4.5k move. I ain't touching shit though, in fact, I have another 20k set aside just to keep moving in slowly during these drops. My big moves are planned for if we repeat the 87% drop of 2014, then I flush most of it in when that pattern hits(around 2.5k-3k range). If it dies when that happens then fuck it, if it lives, then this will be the most awesome experience of my investing career. It's also what all my other colleagues are doing too, and they are way older than me with 10× the capital set aside, and years ahead of me in investing experience with the same movement strategy. We're all analyst by profession too, so you can probably bet other professional investors have similar plans. I suggest you all set aside a "willing to lose fund" for this move too if you want to follow our strategy and buy according to market pattern. I'm sure I'll get a bunch of downvotes, &amp; hate comments responding to this saying market history is not a sign of the future, and you can listen to them if you wish. I mean, it's not like we invest professionally for a living or anything.
 But You Know what they say,  when everyone is crying and yelling **SELL** is when u want to buy,  and no one is yelling sell yet,  we're still in the optimistic hodl psychological phase of a market drop.  But you can bet all those no below 5k predictors will be yelling bloody murder when they see that unimaginable 87% drop we saw in 2014 that made them all cry sell back then.

@_date: 2018-11-20 07:09:00
Yes it did, 2014, 1200 down to 150, an 87% drop. We're not even at a 80% drop atm. Once it goes under 2.5k, then you can say this has never happened before. Study the chart before you start unknowingly making false statements. This will happen again too, next you'll see 100k+ bitcoin drop to 15k; hope you'll have learned your lesson by then. Otherwise you'll be like thousands of others I've known who fear sold on these events and fomo'd back in for half their initial holdings chipping away at your future everytime.

Either way This would be huge, especially if they offer a discount for using it. I know we all know people who spend thousands of dollars a year at that place for their coffee.
Editing in some math: Starbucks stores have 500 daily costumers on average, so with 27thousand stores worldwide, it comes out to 13.5 million costumers a day, on average each spends around 5 dollars for a drink, so that's 68 million dollars a day flowing through the chain of stores, that's 25 billion dollars a year in potential market cap increase. If a decent incentive is given to use bitcoin as payment, then that's a 100 billion market cap increase every 4 years, just from Starbucks alone. So even if the rest of the space stays stagnant, Starbucks alone would bring back the 233 billion market cap bitcoin had at 20k in less than 8 years.
 It would also create huge pressure on the other giants of the industry to to adapt if they see it cause an increase in starbuck's customers. If they can turn even just Walmart with this move, then Walmarts yearly revenue would add half a trillion dollars a year in market cap, who would undoubtedly turn Target to move in and compete, that'll be another 100 billion a year from them, followed by another 170 billion a year if that turns Amazon, add another 100 billion a year if that turns Costco too, then say costco turns walgreens to compete adding another 118 billion a year,  already with those domino's toppled BTC goes into a 1 trillion a years market cap increase from just purchases alone. So not including investment purchases, it would push btc into the 21 trillion dollar market cap we're all waiting for in just 21 years after the topple/adoption. For those who don't know, 21 trillion is the magic number that would put bitcoin over 1 million dollars a coin. Mark my words, Starbucks if they do this, will create a chain reaction where everyone will be forced to add it for just the marketing aspect alone of saying they accept bitcoin, it will be like the early 2000's when every store hopped onto the debit and credit card crave just to get those new costumers in the door. The same will happen here. So buy now while you can, because this move will throw the market into a place we won't recognize; these huge volatile drops of the modern day will be a thing of the past once it starts becoming mainstream from moves like these. Plus after everyone can easily spend it anywhere, then there won't be enough incentive to sell it for dollars and put your financial means at the mercy of fiat currencies exponential 2% yearly inflation.

Me for the crash. Last year I never thought I'd be able to own a full bitcoin, thanks to this crash though, I've been able to stack up over 10 coins. The longer this crash last, the more I can gather. So please keep it low for as long as possible! This is a blessing not a curse.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:04:41
3k would follow the 2014 drop,  it's what me and all my colleagues have been instructing our clients to wait for.  A 2.5k-3k range for their big moves. We've still had them buy little amounts on the way down,  but we have them waiting for that range for their billion dollar moves to be triggered. I've been saying this since summer time,  but everyone here is always too emotional to hear it out so they downvote it as im sure this comment will be. Their other move is to use spelling errors or typos to attempted and discredit the analysis and help make themselves feel correct.  Well,  feeling correct doesn't change reality does it? They can go ahead and play by emotions,  but I'll stick to market pattern. After all, I wouldn't be employed if I didn't. You can't prove anything in the physical world without a historical reference; Science 101. Financial analysis isn't an exact science,  but it science never the less.  So listen to the "global warming doesn't exist" ppl of the financial world as we like to call them,  or listen to those who do this for a living. Just make sure you're concious enough to be on the right side of the financial Darwin award when you're considering your decision.

It's the death of your banking system. Sure we'll be friendly at first with you, only to steal your users though. After they learn they can send money for pennies, then no one will use your services anymore when you charge them huge percentages of what their sending. 
Edit: You want to encourage adoption, ask anyone if they can send thousands to millions of dollars for pennies anywhere else?

You know there are stable coins right? My point is crypto will replace the need of a middle man and cut out uneccesary fees. And certain jobs like contracting don't have direct diposite options hence why one of my clients only pays through paypal. So you stop pretending you know everything like there isn't use cases for crypto just because your pissed you bought at the wrong time. Just sell all your coins now and stay out if your going to be so sore about your shitty buying times.

What's your analysis that it wont? Your emotion that it will hurt to much if it does? Or do you have any real historical data to back it up? Because this is based on historical outcome myself and every colleague of mine has concluded since the summer of this year. And everytime we try and warn you guys here someone like you always comes in telling everyone they doubt it will happen and that we're already at the floor. Thanks to comments like yours, millions of people have unloaded billions of dollars at wrong times to buy. But keep ignoring the professionals, I'm sure your emotions have way better predictions of the future than history does.

U obviously havent been around long. Look at the past 10 years, this is what happens everytime. You think anyone thought it would climb back to a thousand after it fell to 150? You think anyone thought it would come back to 100 after it fell to 10 dollars? You think anyone thought it would go back to 10 dollars after it fell to cents? The market cap of the history of btc including the highest we had is chump change compared to what's out there spent on 1 country alone. But if you really want to believe that, then sell me all your coins for bottom dollar rn

Never thought I could get a full coin because I thought it wouldve kept climbing away to a level beyond reachable means. I knew I could eventually throw in 20k but it would take over a year. Thankfully It has been dipping making that 20k budget i had structured to go into it much more effective in coin accumulation 
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:09:13
Just keep taking advantage of the dip, buy on the way down and you'll have it in no time :) Never buy on the way up is the biggest lesson I learned. Personally my cut off buying mark is past 10k, after that I'm waiting for the next moon and crash to start accumulating again.

Same here. I'm surprised this is barely hitting the front page of this sub now, I've been saying this for over a year now and everyone always downvoted me for it. All wall street has to do it buy less than what is being sold to keep the price climbing down, and the more they get everyone to panic sell, the more they can buy while still bringing down the price. Damn hive mind never listens and goes along with wall street like mice to a fiddler. Either that or wallstreet has chills here downvoting anything that might expose their plans until they want them exposed to insure confidence. It could lean either way, but what I know for certain is they have been strategically buying all the way down.
