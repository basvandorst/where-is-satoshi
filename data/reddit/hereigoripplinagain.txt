Thank you. One final question; Segwit support of future BTC forks? It's been nice to cash-in on the crap-coins generated from all the forks lately - not sure if Segwit is baked into BTC for future forks?

Pre funding is EXACTLY how a checking account works. Y’know, like with a bank. Whereby said bank can collect fees, interest and loan out your money.

Only if you are opening direct payment channels between specific parties. While very useful, has very limited practical real-world use.
If I want to spend my Bitcoin via the Lightning Network like I spend my USD with a credit card today, between any number of people or merchants that accept Bitcoin (and also use the lighting network) - then the only practical method is by using a 3rd party hub to store said Bitcoin first.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:26:54
Your funds can most certainly be seized, loaned and restricted whenever they are in the hands of a 3rd party. (Which would be any hub participating as Lightning Network)

Thanks for re-explaining how it works as if I didn't read the whitepaper. LN is a good idea. But you need to apply common-sense to the problem it is trying to solve; fast transaction speed and low fees to scale. It does both very well, but at the expense of practical, daily, real-world use.
Good luck opening enough channels, with enough stashed BTC to ensure you can use your BTC like a cash/credit card everywhere. And also paying all the BTC transaction fees to open those channels on the blockchain. And waiting for the channel opening transactions to process on the blockchain. And I hope you have enough BTC and spare waiting time to cover incidental purchases whereby there are no Lightning routes from you to your desired merchant.
The only way (currently) to realize practical, daily, real-world use to scale, is through a conglomerate 3rd party. A 3rd party that already has a major network of open channels and enough stashed BTC in these channels to support a massive daily commerce. A place where you store your BTC (nothing to do with the Lightning Network storage) and in return, you can spend your BTC via the Lightning Network in the cheapest, most frictionless way possible. IE; A BANK.
Here is a much more eloquent explanation; 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:46:21
I did. You are handing over your Bitcoin and entrusting it to a 3rd party. In return, you get to spend your Bitcoin with less friction and much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:26:49
Because there is MONEY to be made in offering these off-chain solutions. So you can easily/quickly spend your Bitcoin, without directly spending your Bitcoin. Y’know, exactly what services like checking accounts and credit card companies currently offer.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:20:49
The (current) credit card industry is banks.
But I think you are just referring to the mechanism of using a credit card.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:55:19
You are literally describing a bank and the credit card system used today. A lender based debt/credit dubuios trust system. Except the vaults are full of crypto, not fiat.

u/evoorhees has gone on record stating Bitcoin Cash shouldn't be called Bitcoin at all, because it is its own thing. He's also been a proponent of ole' Bitcoin for 8+ years. So calm the fuck down.
A person in marketing wrote this tweet, and I promise you internal shop-talk has to distinguish Bitcoin Core / Cash to avoid confusion. It's a simple mistake.

XRP is a lot closer to a "company stock" than cryptocurrency in that regard. Wherby they can have splits and raise more capital by selling more of their shares.
Except in this case the "stock" price depends less on the valuation of the company and more on the valuation of the technology and implementation.
It could very well be a scheme - now involving various international banks, 100 million in investor capital and US financial law - and they could flood all their chips and cash out tomorrow. But no-one will be buying 60 billion XRP as a market collapses. And they stand to make far more money as a legitimate business middle manning the planet's financial transactions. Ripple holding 60 million XRP is actually their incentive to stay-the-course and reap the rewards. Ignoring the market cap, dumping large quantities of coins or creating more coins into the public is a dilution of XRPs value. The very value they are using as a funding source. So there doesn't need to be a promise, just an understanding that corporations like to make money more than anything else.

I answered below too. But XRP needs some intrinsic market value. It's not infinately divisble. The value can't be too crazy high, because there are only so many coins and only so much money being moved via direct XRP to XRP - even if that XRP exchanged is in the trillions. If the value was too high, then the transaction fee would cost too much when it's consumed. And in turn the value can't be too low because there is a coin limit that is ever -decreasing.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:17:26
Yup, the price of XRP is meaningless for that purpose. However XRP needs some intrinsic market value so that the fiat conversions equal xxx number of XRP.  And there also needs to be a value assigned to the .0001 XRP that gets consumed. So the bank knows it's profit margin on the transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:46:54
A 320 s/b BTC Shapeshift -&gt; another altcoin just took 4 hours. With a crazy amount of price slippage. BTC Fee was $25 to move $100 of BTC.
At the same time, I did the same amount with XRP Shapeshift -&gt; another altcoin. The transaction took 20 seconds. Fee was a 1/3600 cent.
I love Bitcoin, but it's not practical for basic transactions in it's current state.

Author doesn't understand how XRP works bank to untrusted bank. They only mention the transaction cost, and claim that is the only XRP banks need.
If bank USA wants to send $100 USD to bank Japan and have it deposited as JPY. Then bank USA needs to own at least $100 USD worth of XRP. To process the transfer .0001 XRP is consumed and then bank Japan gets the remainder of the XRP.
If bank USA wants to send another $100 USD to bank Japan the next day, bank USA needs to purchase or make sure they own another $100 USD worth of XRP.

All them XRPs have already been created. ~40 billion are in the wild, and the other ~60 billion are used as leverage. Maybe you mean "speculation" of XRP is out of control.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:06:12
It definitely prevents spam - as long as its worth something. I am not really versed on how Ripple makes its money.
Right now it seems like it is from investors and XRP sales. Is the Ripple protocol a license fee? A subscription? A product sold as a transaction solution - includes onboarding and support. XRP sales might not be an intended revenue stream, but it couldn't hurt!
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:38:54
But the value still needs to be high enough wherby Ripple can sell XRP to the banks even if it's only used trust - to - trust as IOUs with 1 droplet consumed. That droplet's value still needs to be profitable to Ripple, but less than something like a SWIFT fee to make it attractive to banks.
I did napkin math on SWIFT fees from SWIFTs 2015 financial report. Average fee was around .10 cents per transaction over 6.1 (billion) total transactions for that year.
You can kinda work backwards from that to a therorectical competitive value of 1 XRP based on the cost of 1 droplet.
Edit, here's the report PDF. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:11:22
That remains to be seen. If Bank A trusts Bank B, then nothing needs to be immediately exchanged aside from an IOU carried by a single XRP drop. But it Bank A doesn't trust Bank B, then they aren't going to be using their own proprietary Ripple currency between eachother and they need to actually transmit a current market value amount of XRP along with the tiny transaction fee.

The technology is sound. But it is nothing fancy. And neither is the Google search engine. But Google has the majority of search users on the internet, thus has the most value.
You are not going to unite banks in next 15 years through a completely decentralized system. The banks and their customers require trust and insurances that only a centralized entity can provide. And the governments that back these banks require traceable exchanges of currency for tax purposes.
So until you can use Bitcoin or whatever decentralized coin to buy absolutely everything from a pack-of-gum to a house - then at some point you will need a fiat issued by centralized governance. And you can't mine or print that fiat, you will need to get it from a bank.
Banks aren't going away for a while. The technology or company that can onboard the majority of banks to their transaction protocol will have the most value.

Why bother with a reply if "you've only been here 3 weeks" negates validity of statements?
Vilification is happening for the same reason as your lazy reply. You made a snap-judgment based on one single piece of information. All you bother reading is a headline (or user history tag).
