Until they realize that take is destroying their cash cow.  Bitcoin exchanges have the fewest regulations.  It's time for that to change. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 23:40:06
Foreign programmers are already taking it for payment.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:43:23
Really you guys with your idiotic libertarian idealism are destroying this coin.  I think most people that don't support exchange manipulation regulations are enjoying inducing panic and fear in the market or are nutjob libertarians.
We might as well not worry about 51% attacks like GLDcoin and FeatherCoin suffered.  I mean it's free market right?  Idiots.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:36:19
Exactly.  It's still at an infancy state.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:47:36
Libertarian idealism DID NOT create this coin.  Let's get that straight.  Libertarians have been trashing ALL regulation regularly.  It's fucking stupid.
Intelligent, open-source, dedicated programmers created this coin in the spirit that mankind should have a currency that is a good store of value that ULTRA rich elites could not print or manipulate for their own benefit.
Satoshi himself realized that the "free market" without a common sense approach to grow bitcoin would result in disaster.  In the early days, he did not want it associated with Wikileaks.  Why not?  Because he fucking knew that idealistic bullshit didn't work and that you had to nurture it to get it off the ground instead of freely associating it with such potential negativity.

Probably, the biggest problem with bitcoin adoption is exchange manipulation by the gamers.  You get a bunch of "free economy" idealists saying that's crazy, etc, etc. but I don't even understand why they like bitcoin if they are all for a free market.  That's what we have.  The free market produced central banks that simply pay the govt to write rules to keep them in power.
Power and money control everything.  Either we fight it or we don't.  If you don't like fighting the power of huge amounts of wealth then you should just dump bitcoin and embrace fiat.

It's the exchanges moron.  They will wise up when bitcoin manipulations drop the price to 5 bucks again.  It's too bad they can't see that far ahead.
Stop parroting some idealistic bullshit that doesn't work.

Fuck you.  Sorry I missed a damn c dick.
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:56:22
Don't worry, without exchange regulation from massive manipulation, it's going to drop to zero.  Get in then and you can have all the coins.  I'll even sell you some fibonacci numbers if you like.

Bitcoin users shouldn't try to convince anyone anymore.  They are quickly becoming the minority.  Just tell him and move on.  
He'll change his mind when a ton of online stores are allowing bitcoin for payment.
@_date: 2013-06-20 22:44:59
So you want to make a quick 200 bucks.  Why not just save it for when it's worth 10k per coin or 100k per coin.
I only spend mine now on foreign programmers.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:57:25
No matter what the libertarian douches here think, the price has gone down lately and will continue until the exchange manipulation is regulated just like other currencies exchanges.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:38:17
Some of them are close now.  Did you not realize this?
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:39:48
Mt. Gox rate limits per hour, end micro fractional buy and sells, rate limits per person per hour, rate large dumps by single sellers.  The list goes on and on. 
If they don't like Gox doing this then go somewhere else.  All those that actually want to make an investment will avoid the bullshit exchanges so the gamers can game with just themselves.
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:41:35
People stop doing that as fear increases.  Folks can ignore reality for only so long, then you have no more bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:51:47
Libertarians are idiots.  They are the main ones that keep up the stupid demands that bitcoin exchanges not have measures put in place to prevent manipulation.
You know...free market bullshit taken to the extreme.  Libertarians don't think electrons should be bound so tightly to atoms.  There should never be any rules--math, physics, bitcoin.  It doesn't matter to them.  No rules!!
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:41:47
Copycat.  :P

I have not looked at the code myself, perhaps I should, but I would not assume that computational power would grow exponentially while the difficulty would not.  
It's as if folks think Moore's law was created last month.
I'm pretty sure it's a LOT easier to create a function that increases the difficulty exponentially vs ensuring processing power continues to grow exponentially.
@_date: 2013-06-18 22:51:05
Jesus guys.  This isn't hard and it's all accounted for.  As the hash rate goes up, so does the difficulty, sometimes one outpaces the other but they balance out over time.
Come on guys...damn.

Buy bitcoins from coinbase.com and transfer them to a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:27:59
Yep.  People pick what works.  That's why you like bitcoin.  Guess what...it's full of rules.  People want to be protected from super rich elites.  That's WHY you're even interested.   What do you think the federal reserve is?
@_date: 2013-06-16 19:46:31
That's ME!!  When did you take this picture?  
I bought 100,000 bitcoins for 5000 bucks back then.  I couldn't afford to pay my rent for like 6 months so I lived in a tent.
I held onto my bitcoins though.  I sold half around 160 bucks.  Needless to say, I don't live like this anymore.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:37:05
The only ones going to unregulated exchanges would be the manipulators.
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:18:01
It's not lack of faith in the coin, it's an understanding that the current libertarian mindset discouraging regulation of the exchanges to limit manipulation is fucking everyone.
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:44:45
Actually it is.  The market is too small to endure extreme manipulations.  It only slows the markets growth.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:35:10
Most exchanges have far more regulations that bitcoin exchanges.  It's wisdom that bore out over many, many years.
It seems it's time for the really large pools to teach the bitcoin world a hard lesson with a real 51% attack.  It's free market right?  All's fair in love and war and such nonsense.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:24:33
I don't believe in the Illuminati but if you look at the primary shareholders of all the banks in the Federal Reserve, they are the same group.
There are definitely very rich groups in this world that call a lot of the shots.  No one can deny that.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:38:42
With nobody buying.
@_date: 2013-06-18 21:25:57
This isn't true.  It's impossible.  The difficulty goes up for miners.  Bitcoins will be added on a regular predefined schedule.
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:56:35
Uhh..open a Coinbase account, linked it to your checking account, send bitcoins to coinbase and transfer this to your checking account.
Why is this so hard?  It's the nature of bitcoin to offer flexibility folks.
