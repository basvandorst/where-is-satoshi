I'm guessing you will see resistance at $440 for a while, then another downswing leveling off around $415 in the next 5 hours.

Thank you so much!  I actually remember this kid I sat next to on the bus had the 500 and I was jealous.  I sometimes still think back and laugh about how MB's were a big deal back then, to the extent that I would rewrite all my music at lower compression to save space... those were the days.

My guess is 415ish
