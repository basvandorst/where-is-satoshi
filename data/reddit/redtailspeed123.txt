I made a lot of these magnets during the bitcoin boom and left them sitting when I was in high school. Now i'm trying to find a place for all of them! Sticks great to any magnetic surface! (Fridges, Metal Cabinets, Cars, ETC).
The shipping can be paid through paypal or even bitcoin! 
Thank you so much for all your support and let me know if you have any questions through DM!
Update: I only have 500 in stock so they're gonna go fast, also added International Shipping! Since i've received many inquiries about it 
Update: Wow this is crazy, thanks guys! I already set the order limit to 10 items in your cart to make it fair for everyone, you will not be able to go through checkout if you have more than that.
Update: I can only process $100 worth of BTC on bitpay so paypal is a lot easier for me, thanks so much! 
Update: I exceeded the amount that bitpay can process today, will take it off the payment until tomorrow! Instead, just use paypal!

Thank you man, I appreciate all the support

Its in the item description but they are 3 inches or 7.6 cm in diameter
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:13:39
I made both at the time but I guess the thumbnail screwed up

If you order more than 10, you won't be able to get any option due to the limits I set, try reducing the cart size and doing it again 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:17:34
I'll take a look asap, sorry for that inconvenience 
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:13:22
Saw it! Thank you so much! I'll send them all off at the end of the week. If you have any questions please let me know!

More like trying to find a place for 1000 magnets

Sorry fam, I live in Canada so shipping to US is already one thing. Tell you what, I'll inquire the costs today and see if I can do it for you :)
