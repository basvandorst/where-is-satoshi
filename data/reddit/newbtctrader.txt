I also sent 0.01159506 BTC from my blockchain.info wallet 19g9UPkZ7jWeBXXV4BjF7VvNfat82EUSkq
to My Hidden Wallet  1GC7dDzRijTUCdkrJLvEoUt4VHkaofaSLb on 2017-10-20 22:13:36.
I am a complete newbee to this and after doing some research have seen that this is 100% a scam. I have since found out that you can put the wallet address of My Hidden Wallet 1GC7dDzRijTUCdkrJLvEoUt4VHkaofaSLb in search bar at blockchain info and see a complete list of all transacctions. They must be giving multiple people the same wallet address because there is multiple transactions going in and then being transferred back out! My btc did not even show up on my wallet but I can see that it went there and is still there along with a number of other transactions that have since landed in there. I can also see that a withdrawal was done the day before I deposited, this is what the scammer obviously does when they require some funds :)
Then lets it build up again lol!
I was testing out a few wallets and did the same thing with another wallet called OnionWallet  which is also a scam.
I sent 0.01 BTC from wallet
1cHqk9nqCrWAc8sEtqhpXPJo8Gj72q2J4 to onion wallet address 18keq6U23za3WHhxFHgg57vUo6GcDimaAo and it arrived with no problems at all. 
Thinking this was safe I then mad a second deposit to this wallet of 0.0228985 BTC from wallet address 1KsauoirznymuajQ9jeNRjTQJcPCgX2wgy to the same wallet
Again deposit showed up on my balance and new balance was 0.0328985 BTC, all great so far.
But when I tried to make a transfer it diverts me to a white screen and no withdrawal happens.
The frustrating thing is, I went to the hidden wiki for guidance 
 
and both these sites were under editors picks under financial services.
Without seeing that and getting some reassurance I would not have used those sites, I dont understand why those sites are being recommended and endorsed!
I knew there was still a risk which is why I only transferred small amounts. Since then I have done some research and seen these two have been scams for years, I cant understand how they are still around and why they are still being recommended on hidden wiki as an editors pick?
For someone new to crypto currency and bitcoin this is all a complete minefield, and I don't feel the community does even nearly enough to expose the scams or at least no recommend them.
I'm seeing only a few reviews and they are from 3 years ago then I found this recent post. So I decided to leave this review on Hidden Wallet and Onion Wallet.
