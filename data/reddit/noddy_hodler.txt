The dog has got a big new fucking tail.  The dog is currently a touch reluctant to wag the tail as it might fall off, or worse, blow its balls off. 
However, it *is* a fine looking tail, and is sure to attract the right type of bitches given time.

The three vital ingredients of Bitcoin: trustless, permissionless, decentralised.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:13:33
Ironically, the money of the internet needs to be stored in a manner that involves the private key having never touched the internet.  At least for now.
A hardware wallet basically gaps the private keys from your PC, and so it a pretty good method (assuming you still wish to transact from time to time).
If you don't intend to spend for a while, and just want safe storage, then paper wallets are the way to go 
It's just a pain in the arse when you want to move the coins, as you have to load it up onto a less secure device.
Just remember, paper burns, paper gets wet, paper is easily stolen or read, so you still have physical security risks. 
At the end of the day this is a trade off between security and convenience: you can't have both!

Short answer: yes.  Long answer: most definitely. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:16
Generally, yes, but my reply likely wasn't the correct answer.  The thing about bitcoin security is that if people know what your security is, then by definition, it is no longer secure.

The concept of ownership is a human trait.  Bitcoin is just an abstract set of mathematical rules, which is valuable if people collectively decide it has value.

Decentralisation is worth fighting for, and decentralised consensus unfortunately takes more time, with no CEO telling you what to think and do.  PayPal has already been invented, and don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for such a service.  I guess bcash is preferable to PayPal at least!
Bcash goes down a road that diminishes bitcoin's most important feature, and does so in a way that is underhand and undemocratic.  
High fees are a necessary growing pain, as will be (attempted) regulation further down the road.

Who knows.  Generally with lump sum investing, 100% upfront is the highest risk/reward ratio, so you need to determine how pissed off you'll be if the price rises compared to if it falls.

I believe this to be the case.  You do a mainchain tx to open a channel and lock the funds.  The channel can then be closed by either party with a further tx.
Download eclair for Android, get some testnet coins, and blockachino up...it makes a lot more sense when you see it in action first hand!
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:13:21
So water, much thinks, wow.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:08:51
Yes, the logic is that you need a main chain transaction to open and close the channel, but can do as many low cost instant transactions until such a point as the channel needs to be closed.  
You are correct that there will be congestion further down the road, which neither 1mb nor 8mb nor 64mb blocks can currently solve.
Perhaps another layer will eventually be required?  Main chain is the settlement layer, equivalent to intrabank transfers, LN is the personal bank account equivalent...a further layer on top for microtransactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:18:03

Separate to your personal allowance yes.  Basically, if your gain is less than £11,300 in any given tax year (gain = proceeds less base cost), there is nothing to report. 
Say you sell £20k of bitcoin that cost you £5k.  That is a £15k gain, the first £11,300 is exempt, so you would be liable for tax on the balance of £3,700, which would be taxed along with your other salaried income (10% if you have any basic rate left, 20% if you're a higher rate tax payer).
You can report gains separately if you have no other income, to save the hassle of doing a tax return.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:13:22
More importantly, you can also recover your funds in the event of loss or corruption of said ledger.

Looking at Jaxx on my phone, it supports bitcoin, ethereum, Ethclassic, litecoin, dash, zec, doge, Bcash, Golem, Rep, BAT, Gnosis, Digix, Iconomi, Monaco, Bancor, Aragon, Tokencard, Civic, Stox, Bcap, EOS, Firstblood....quite a few more getting into real shitcoin territory here.
