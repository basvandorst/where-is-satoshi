I got in ATH with $5000 on Tuesday and want to pull out my principal,  but coinbase hasn’t even credited me my coins yet.
I’m getting my pink wojaks ready in case it tanks before i’m credited with my coins

There are currently BTC whales who can send double digit bitcoin amounts and not give a flying fuck.

If anything bitcoin proved it failed as a currency.

I could lose every penny of that investment and not self harm. I’ll admit i’ve got FOMO, and generally live my life according to r/personalfinance doctrine.

Mcdonald’s wins in price and value, and offers a tangible products. 
BTC does literally none of that

Will come crashing down to the floor of $0, especially once Coinbase lists BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:48:49
You’ll feel silly when it drops to four digits 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:06:25
Not with bitcoin, it’s never hitting $300,000 lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:41

Have fun getting your money in a week!

Given some of the recent posts it probably reflects what other people think. 
And what else is BTC? It’s a risky investment at best, anyone thinking it’s a currency in its current state is deluded. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:21
It’s literally normies 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:17
Speculated? Open coinbase right now

Crypto will die as a get rich quick ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:18:33
Hodl is just a typo? I always assumed it meant Hold On (for) Dear Life, because crypto is incredibly volatile 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:59
Bitcoin always drops considerably EOY
It was 4 digits to start this month
Media will report a massive crash, fueling weak handed normies selling at a loss 
Tons of alts to choose from. 
Bitcoin still has a long way to drop
