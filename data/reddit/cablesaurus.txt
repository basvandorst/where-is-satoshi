Quality matters basically if one obtains a lousy modular PSU that has poor pinout load balancing.

This is a great idea Absentis.

Not true. All cards draw a marginal amount of power thru the Mobo. This is what the Molex cable is for, to negate motherboard damage from running too many GPU's through the bus.

You would want to make sure both GPU's are recognized as seperate cards, a crossfire cable is not necessary, but a "dummy plug" is useful if you don't have a spare display to plug into each the cards. This may or may not be required depending on the card model one would be working with.

Generally you would need 1 plug for what you describe.

Your hash rate wouldn't be affected by Crossfire, you may run into weird issues if you try to OC though.
It will indeed get around the dummy plug issue however.

What hypermog says regarding PSU quality is important.
As long as you have available 1x, 16x, or even old PCI slots, motherboard, processor speed, ram type, etc. are irrelevant. You'll get the same efficiency from your miners regardless.

We offer a stackable, rack mountable chassis on the web site.
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:16:48
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll look into that.

Should have more specifics on price soon, thought don't have the final figures yet. The adapters will be static/non flexible, but will work with an extender coming from the adapter.

I believe bitporium.com sells rigs for BTC.

No, you will not see any effect on mining hashrate from running the x16 gpu from an x1 slot. So yes, you can connect more cards if you have ample power.
@_date: 2011-06-16 22:20:16
Yes, the PCI-&gt;PCIe adapters will work for mining. They'll be in stock with pictures, Monday.

Hi, I'm Cablesaurus. As Reddit has plugged into the Bitcoin world, many here may be wrestling with the complications of securely mounting accumulating graphics cards and mining rig gear; getting all cards to recognize; or how to utilize all possible motherboard slots for Bitcoin purposes to save hardware costs
Plenty of helpful discussion to help those new and experienced to the scene alike in our Bitcoin Forum thread: 
We love to help miners get the most out of their rigs. Feel free to come to us with any questions you might have.
