I am fairly new to the community. I have been reading for hours daily to try and catch up. The one thing that has eluded me the most was the situation about Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. After reading a lot about Roger Ver, and doing my research on all of the social media platforms it has become clear to me whats going on.
I am sure I am not the only to propose this. However, ill give it a shot. What if Roger Ver were to become Roger Verdemort. The Bitcoin community would simply not acknowledge this person any longer in a negative or positive way.
I think the conflicting posts across social media are just polarizing communities as humans tend to pick "teams". I am with team "a" therefore I despise team "b".
This will be my first and last post like this. Call me a hypocrite for posting this. I am just proposing a potential solution to the FUD on social media.

I thought about that as well. Couldn't there be a sticky instead? Differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?

Yes, he could be listed in there as a main proponent of Bcash. Also, a more clear listing of his anti-bitcoin properties such as btc subreddit, bitcoin.com and his bitcoin twitter.
I feel by constantly mentioning this guy is giving him way too much power.

I am up voting this post. I made a similar post last year and was down voted.
It would be like if you went to coca cola Reddit and it was a bunch of posts about pepsi. Its stupid and a waste of time.

The problem with Zerohedge articles are that the vast majority are sponsored to sell some conspiracy media. This article is one as well. Scroll to the bottom and you will see a link selling conspiracy media. The truth is that Bitcoin will succeed if we can make it as simple and effortless as an apple device. Once you can show people a super simple UI with powerful financial tools Bitcoin will win. Steve Jobs was a bad person but the Bitcoin ecosphere should model itself after his philosophy.
"The organization is clean and simple to understand, and very accountable. Everything just got simpler. That's been one of my mantras -- focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." 
-Steve Jobs

I think you bring up a good point. Just because someone doesn't like someone who are they to tell everyone else to stop using it?
How about people write about their negative/positive experience, and let everyone else judge for themselves.
I usually immediately dismiss something if its someone TELLING ME to do something. Why should you get to tell me shit?

I think before they had something called bitpay. Which just allowed you to purchase gold using Bitcoin. However now they are directly taking several crypto currencies. Anyways I just got this email so I assume its a recent change in their business model.

Who wants to take a guess what this coin will be backed by?

You can keep a tally of bad news... doesnt mean anything to me. If and when I decide to do business with someone I will do my research. I dont need to login to r/bitcoin and see a bunch of boycott posts. Its extremely annoying and makes everyone look like a bitter old codger.

Yes, he was just on JRE trashing cryptocurrencies. He also just moved his entire operation to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes. Guess hes not doing so hot right now.

Don't delude yourselves. This is bad news. However google is one of the worst ad agencies to use. Any respectable company uses much better advertisers for their website.

I am very confused... these screenshots on this article are wrong. When I go to bitcoin.com I am seeing nothing of the sort.
I will have to dismiss this article for now until someone can prove this was changed recently.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:55:08
I agree, but they need to show the proof of this screenshot. Anyone can make a fake version of a website.
