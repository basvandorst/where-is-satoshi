My town is showing like 40 of these Cardtronics ATMs according to their website. However, only 3 of them say they are doing Bitcoin as of this post. Heck, one of them is in my local Costco lol. They must be slowly upgrading some of them. 
I usually buy from my local National Bitcoin ATM. I'll have to check out this Cardtronics one. 
Long as it doesn't require an ID or biometric scan, it will compare well with the National Bitcoin brand ATM depending on the fees.
