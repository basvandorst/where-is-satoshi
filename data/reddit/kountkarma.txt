Lets say it's for reasonable discussion in one convenient page.  Avoiding more tabs is not lazy!  and thank you for your service.

a paywall priority for large transactions (or those who can afford to make more or faster transactions) to me sounds like something I want to avoid.  Transaction fees should be standard for any transaction.

a list doesn't keep coins from being used for illegal activity it just means you have two wallets the one you use for anonymity and the one you use for open-ness.  The first subverts law (not all laws are just) and the second builds trust (not all political funders have society interest in mind some funding should not be anonymous)

These are holidays EXCLUSIVELY for banks and government.  It's not to celebrate veterans it's to give Banks and Government days off.  Most working class do not get a holiday.

Who cares what happens in the states, if Chinese don't care about a BTC used to by coke in Mexico and still accept it in China then it's value is un-changed for most of the world.

I've set aside what I need until my next job season and a bit more for unexpected purchase but yes, until about may I'm damn broke :) Not going to miss a meal though and do not have other obligations.  What I put in today was everything I can afford to not have until back to work.

that said I see the immediate need for competing currency.  One total anonymous to function as intended and the other to function where "count" matters or accountability matters.

What if we began running coins through black places.  Every clean coin you find you taint it before spending make it practically impossible to accept only untainted ones if you want to accept any at all.

edit: Saw [this right]( after I posted and realized others are trying to spin this way too... but when they say it it sounds nefarious as fuck and I dont want it anymore
I think BC needs to develop 2nd layering.  (1) As it is now, anyone can send any money to anyone anonymously without a 3rd party.  There are countless reasons why no 3rd party should have to be involved in the system of trade.  (Ie no reason banks get a % of every transaction everywhere and a % of every paycheck)
But the (2)nd layer must be a coin that can be tracked.  The longer it's history the bigger the story the more it's trusted.  Then that individual coin can be judged based on it's history.  I might not accept dollars that come from the Westboro baptist church for example if I were running for office.  I would want to accept money only with a certain history (open to the public) within so many generational trades.
It doesn't mean that the WBC can't spend or receive BC they just probably won't have much traction at level (2) spending in some areas (maybe more in others) where certain transactions request your money have a certain history.  Not a history of buying guns or selling missiles or some tragedy... unless you are into that.
So lets say I agree to pay you a BC for a service, but I want to go on the record for it.  The coin is now type (2) and has a receipt in my wallet and in yours outlining the contract no names, still anonymous.  This means each coin has a numerical value and a historical one.  Its historical worth is exactly listed as what it was traded for.
Then level 3 might be not anonymous receipts on the coin required for any state run or official things.  Family members might, for example, be able to see their family names on receipts because of Fbook setting somewhere.  Club members can see names of the transaction of other members.  Citizens can see the names on govt because all govt dollars have to be spent at level 3
Other mechanics obviously must come into play this is just a scenario of the types of overlays possible.

oh ya the trollbox!  I'm finding it very entertaining.
