Fellow german here. I've bought BTC in 3 ways.
1. Bitcoin.de (have to verify a sepa bank account)
2. Bitcoin ATM in Bochum (NRW, no ID, 40€ limit)
3. Used Purse.io to exchange a amazon wishlist for BTC 
So far purse.io has been most hassle free and the ATM in Bochum the fastest/most anonymous. I must admit I did however not compare fees as I didn't really care for +- a few % seeing as I'm planning a one way HODL moon trip.

I guess you have a point. However if dogechain.info somehow gets temporarily corrupted by a hack it wouldn't cause everyone to lose everything they had...

Used it once. Pretty bad deal for anyone buying btc. Its more anonymous/more accessible than an exchange but that doesn't warrant a &gt;20% fee. Only takes a little effort to get a better deal somewhere else.

I regularly place orders with that company here in Germany. Since early 2014. It was great to show my gf "here, I can get pizza with my BTC. Therefore me talking about Bitcoin for months on end is justified" :D
Actually ordered 2 pizzas + a little something today. 50 kbit and it tastes so much better than paying with anything else. Only issue is tipping the delivery guy. I wish I could tip bits but I doubt the guy even knows what bitcoin is.

What's that in Bit?

why not specify a source in the script that both parties agree on? For this specific case say a dogechain.info public wallet URL

Congrats on being one of the 21 million! I stumbled across bitcoin last year but only learned about it in detail over the past 6 months. Now that I've been able to pay for my pizza and furniture in bits I'm hooked and can't wait for the day I turn my back entirely on Fiat.

No no, I meant the two paries agree on the source for the info which then is used by all the miners to confirm the transaction.

What I wrote is my opinion. I could also say purse.io leverages customer sophistication to facilitate deals that favor bitcoin spenders at the cost of lazy noobies. The fact that the service is marketed soley under the discount aspect would speak for my argument. 
The site works as intended and CC fraud issues are outsourced to amazon so technically you are right one can't evaluate other people's subjective blablabla. 
If people want to bash their head against a wall I wouldnt stop em either.
