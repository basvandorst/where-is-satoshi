whats the website?

Check this out and you can see why I say that- also I still don’t like technical analysis too much on crypto as I think we can both agree it is largely sentiment and speculation. That being said it has formed support twice at the 13k range- a famous double support that looks like a W- look at the 30 day graph and you’ll see.
Here’s the reference on that 
I’m no expert but those seem like clear indicators of a reversal- like I said I’m more into sentiment though- check out this google trends search on what’s happening over the past 7 days. I look at it every day to tell myself crypto is legit.

Actually it seems like this guy may try to port your phone with your phone number and try to steal your accounts

It’s market manipulation- have you seen the shorts positions? Hedge funds push the price down, cash out on shorts contacts- look at the volume on xbt this morning (cboe) futures. They swing those profits into long contracts, buy btc low and swing it back up.
Remember it’s the Wild West and they can do whatever they want. 
Or I’m wrong and this is a big slide to a bear market.

Look at the Volume on your graph and you’ll see why it isn’t actually a bubble. This isn’t the stock market, and even if it was the first rule of stocks is past performance doesn’t equal future results.

As an investor? Wouldn't you want to include the .dom bubble, the actual most comparable event since you seem to not believe in the value of bitcoin. 
It speaks to me that you have an issue with confirmation bias.

Yeah that’s the biggest argument that I’ve heard towards bitcoin being centralized, that creation of ASICS allows people to concentrate hash power and control the network. I don’t want to critize bitcoin but I can’t imagine that Satoshi wanted a few large groups of people to control the network. 
In that regards I actually think making algorithms take more memory to force individuals to run the network is a little better- but this is only based on my limited understanding- don’t roast me!

He changed this article after all the backlash he got for not doing his research. On top of that he censors the blog and his moderators only allow a few opposing views to get through.
It’s an echo chamber and total shit- don’t waste you time with any of his blogs past like number 100.

This guy gets it. Bitcoin is not a security.

What you don’t want a massage too?

Yes I’ll have one massage please. Thank you.

Great post. But why do I care if the miners in massive farms disappear? Isn’t the hash rate from millions of individuals around the world enough to run the network and still have consensus? 
Isn’t that part of the idea of ETH mining and such- that they are ASIC resistant due to larger memory requirements?

Hi, I don't understand bitcoin but look at this fancy graph that looks just like another fancy graph. Based on this, I can definitively say bitcoin is a bubble. /s

I think that’s a big worry for a lot of people- that the middle class will get stuck holding the bag while an unseen person runs away with the profits. Probably why Merrill lynch and some other companies are doing what they think protects their people.
I don’t blame them for trying to protect people- but as bitcoin improves and becomes global the value of bitcoin going up actually reduces volatility- which is why these altcoins are surging while bitcoin growth is less rapid.
Also, even if there was some evil whale force out there waiting to dump and leave everyone stranded- I don’t think they’d kill their cash cow, when they could just milk it for a few months and make the same profit- I mean the total market cap of crypto alone has gone up 600b in two months.
In addition to that even if they did dump the ideals that bitcoin have brought to the forefront will survive, and even if it becomes a martyr the scene as a whole will persist.

They said they were processing 250k+ apps a day on binance. I see how you could think it would be fishy based on user count- but to process 250k applications and run a server that does 5b in transaction volume a day is pretty insane.  
Just for reference the top website in the USA in the 50-100 rank get about 15 million views per month. They were processing that many new users per month!

You’ve seen them demand their bitcoin? The valley deviants are getting smarter.
