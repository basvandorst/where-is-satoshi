Indeed. I have to submit 3 investment forms each tax season for my stocks. Which includes a simplified history, on top of the normal 401k and roth stuff.

He means "I am still in Japan, where I probably will be staying for the rest of my life, in fear of what the many people I F'd over will do to me.".

My offline website begs to differ. It's made for me, and allows me to circlejerk with myself, using the latest technology of pencil and paper!

I feel as though they should have had some sort of AWS/Azure redundant region connectivity for this. One region goes down, 4 more are up and taking traffic.
Unless they don't use either or anything that supports creating those types of setups on-the-fly, then, well, they are SOL.

I build this for every major app we deploy for a large company. I've scaled to 800k DAU many times before, and it kind of is required to have at least 2 unique regions (not sub-regions) configured at one time for each component. 
Am unsure if they did this or not though, but this shouldn't of happened if Comcast impacted them and they were using one of the major platforms.

Bitcoin at 1890: "BUT THAT'S STILL HIGH!" 
Me: Well then, while you sit and wait, I will go ahead and make $1500/coin profit.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:18:43
Wonder if this could cause it to hit 10k

Damn crashing bitcoin! Making me money and shit; HOW DARE IT!
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:25:57
Hmm. Is this that double spending issue going around?
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:10:09
I would keep getting people on board with Bitcoin. An ATM is useless if no one will utilize what it provides. Once you start seeing news that it will pop up in some large chain stores, is when you should research the ATM route and implement (preferably around the areas they are in).
Crypto is still in the baby stages. It will happen, and it is good people are starting to get the ATMs out there, but you need mass adoption first, or you will eat running costs out of your pocket.

A CME can disrupt some tech, but we can protect against it. If he thinks a CME can wipe out Bitcoin, or any piece of tech at that matter though, you probably wouldn't be able to convince him the planet is round either.

Ya, I think Poloniex would skew the total. Down to 2125 there now.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:41:50
Sitting here on Poloniex. You goin off of the average from all the exchanges? I know it is 2956 in Coinone, and similar in the other Asian exchanges.

Passed the moon. I think we almost somewhere between venus and mercury now.

Every coin I've bought this week, even on a dip, ALWAYS dips when I buy. It's our curse [feelsbadman.jpg].

Wasn't there some article going around saying there will be a hard fork even with SegWit activation? I'd say that would cause some people to want to wait until August 1st is passed before making any trades. Everything is going sideways, means people aren't 100% sure of what's really gonna happen. I tried to apply sense and lost 1k, so well, Imma do the same.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:30:06
2181 a sec ago. Will recover later on down the line but damn. Much of the larger coins are shit now. Taking losses from 4 of them, even when buying at 2 day average lows.
Wonder where things will be next week.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:26:18
And the fact it is a Monday. This is the normal cycle regardless if we into the ground or not.

Depends on the context. Although outright following someone without thought or logic would qualify as delusional. While I can use Luke's followers as an example, it would be unfair to, as, I can also use many people within the other Crypto communities as examples as well.

Can see this as a volume pump to get higher returns on an exit for companies that missed the previous selloff and want to get out at +$300. While it is good to see things to rise, we are still a month out out from any sort of all clear.

To be fair, you can purchase Reddit accounts in bulk (IIRC like 1k for around .20c a piece, 10k for around .8c). 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:12:28
That's a month away. Lots of trades to be made before then.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:05:49
It's not too late for anything. I gave a few friends split about 200 bux a piece from some surplus coinage from a  gain. Two are up to twice that from the volatility in alt coins alone. Build up your BTC portfolio (or whatever your fancy is) using that method.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:00:08
Only if it gets sub 1500. Got two big trades lined up for that price ehhe.

If they can't do level 3 validation for accounts in 2 months, then I can only imagine what happens with support times on 100x more people wanting to withdraw.

We talking about gambling huh? BTC, ETH, LTC go hand-in-hand (as most of the USD traders), but ETH has it worse as their movements are much more irrational than the rest. When gdax/coinbase goes on a vacation, so does my money. Once you can hear the sparks flying due to the ETH rims hitting the pavement, the whale screams inside the the tuna factory as they get processed, and possibly harambe resurrecting just to get a banana stuck in his bum and make the news; then you know it's time to go all in.

Quite frankly would have had a quarter paid in BTC while the rest in USD. I would hate to receive my a paycheck in BTC right before the bubble bursts or something else of that nature comes happens.
I like playing things on the safe side though.

With what I paid for mine, I should get a portrait of the product with a glass of Le Pin Bordeaux propped up on a beach in the Bahamas.

Bought a $175 Amazon card through them. Going to keep loading up my Amazon account with gift cards.
