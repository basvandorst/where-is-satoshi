Read about to help improve your BTC spending privacy.

Send from Circle/Coinbase to an electrum wallet.  Send from the electrum wallet to a [JoinMarket](wallet.  Sendpayment via JoinMarket to your destination.  It will be difficult/impossible to follow the coins from the source to the destination.  Reverse the process to cash out (Funds Source -&gt; JM wallet -&gt; Electrum -&gt; Circle/CB).  Be sure to use new, unused addresses during each step for best privacy.

The project continues to grow.  It will help provide more privacy to bitcoin users as it becomes more refined and distributed.

Blockchain analysis is only one piece of the strategy these companies use to create their databases for law enforcement.  Lots of companies will gladly sell customer information.  Privacy is hard.  Anonymity might be impossible.  It's very easy to make a mistake that can compromise identity information, or link other data to an identity.
I wonder how coinjoin services like affect the analysis.  Used properly, I believe it makes correlation very difficult.  It would be interesting to see a comprehensive study of the strategies used by the tracing entities versus the available privacy tools for bitcoin.

Great dinner, and a very enjoyable speaker.




I'll have to watch my video again to see how I phrased the question, but I am hopeful that will gain the exposure and utility to help solve this problem for bitcoin.  I was hoping he had thoughts about that specific project, but I may have worded it poorly.  I enjoyed his reference to spapeshift as a useful, if unintended, privacy tool.

To add, in regards to transaction announcement privacy, JoinMarket has also recently included a [script to broadcast transactions]( with some good privacy features.

The project, while still relatively small, is doing some great things toward making privacy available to all BTC users.  It would be great if more developers would get involved to include the JM smart contract options in their respective wallets and other projects where fungibilty and privacy may be concerns.  There are still lots of ideas to be implemented to further enhance the ability to secure better privacy.

Some important bug changes and features were added, so I would recommend upgrading, although it is not required, per se.

Cool, I thought there was another source/discussion I hadn't seen yet maybe.
I didn't get very far when [I played the game]( either.  :/

Once you have installed tor on your system according to the recommendations from the [tor project guide]( you will need to make a few changes to your configurations for tor and bitcoin core.
To create your tor hidden service, edit the torrc file, which should be located in /etc/tor.
    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
Add these lines to your torrc file, and take note of the default SocksPort in this file, which will be used in your bitcoin.conf later.
    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/
    HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333
Save the file by pressing CTRL + X , type y to confirm changes and press enter. Restart tor to enable the hidden service.
    sudo service tor reload
Find the onion address for your bitcoin hidden service:
    sudo cat /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname
This will output something like wpi7rpvhnndl52ee.onion - copy it to use in your bitcoin.conf later.
You may also want to backup the private key of your hidden service so you can restore it later in case of data loss and keep using the same .onion address.
Copy the file called private_key from /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/ and store it in a secure location.
For best security you should not store it anywhere as plain text, since anyone having this key would be able to steal your .onion address.
Include these lines in your bitcoin.conf:
    rpcuser=somerandomstringCHANGETHIS!
    rpcpassword=somethingsecureCHANGETHIS!
    daemon=1
    server=1
    rpcport=8332
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
    externalip=**your .onion address from 'sudo cat /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname'. Should be something like wpi7rpvhnndl52ee.onion**
    onlynet=tor
    listen=1
    discover=0
    bind=127.0.0.1:8333
    addnode=wpi7rpvhnndl52ee.onion
    addnode=h2vlpudzphzqxutd.onion
    addnode=sbow7bnje2f4gcvt.onion
    addnode=dioq2yg3l5ptgpge.onion
    addnode=kjy2eqzk4zwi5zd3.onion
    addnode=2l2u6mrojvm6zypx.onion
    addnode=gb5ypqt63du3wfhn.onion
    addnode=zc6fabqhrjwdle3b.onion
    addnode=it2pj4f7657g3rhi.onion
You may also find the [guides at Sky-IP]( helpful for setting up your bitcoin tor node, although these are not 'official' guides so be sure to review the current guide version from the tor project first, for security reasons.
Lastly, there is this [change in Bitcoin v 0.12.0]( but I don't know much about it, or if it affects the traditional methods.

Curious where you saw this prize amount?
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:00:06
Well, 0.4900% isn't bad, as far as mixers go, but it's no [JoinMarket](/r/joinmarket).
