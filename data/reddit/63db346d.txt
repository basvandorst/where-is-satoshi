As soon as ANY amount of profit is there, that statement is valid actualy. Even with BTC at $9001.1, grandpa more than doubled his $0.50 profit ;)

ok let me explain: 
looking at how my statement began: there is a total profit TP &gt;0, TP € R  
=&gt; there is a profit P &gt; 0 with 0 &lt; P &lt; 2P &lt; (2P + X ) &lt;= TP,   while P, X € R  and X &gt; 0
=&gt; no matter how much TP you got, as long as the assumtion: TP &gt; 0 is valid, you can find a profit P which is more than doubled and the authors statement is valid

Can you please explain more why BIP91 can't activate before Aug. 1??  As far as I can see, BIP91 is going to activate between July 21-29 (BIP91 intention signaling is already 90%, see  soo till July 29  BIP141 (Segwit) is going to be activated thanks to BIP91 and therefore BIP148 doesn't happen (because BIP148 is only triggered if Segwit is not activated till Aug 1). Now again the question, why do you think it's guaranteed BIP148 is happenning? Do I understand something wrong? Isn't the opposite is coming? It rather looks like BIP148 won't happen. There is nothing to fear actually?
