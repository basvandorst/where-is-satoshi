I felt this traveling abroad. I need a local credit card with local billing address and local currency to do online shopping, and I have to get used to local money when I want to spend money on the streets, which I'm sure I'll have some left over after the travel. If Bitcoin adoption became popular as a universal currency to help the tourism industry, that would be really convenient. I would be able to travel around the globe without having to obtain local currency each time and have to deal with their local payment system each time.

It's not entirely just the corporation's fault. The free press, consumer protection agencies, enlightened individuals, etc. also failed to discover, call out and publicize Apple's security flaw. Apple wasn't the only one that was asleep here.
Edit: To be clear, I'm not saying Apple doesn't deserve blame.

US officials have confiscated money going in and out of Las Vegas before. Perhaps bitcoin would be an ideal solution.

Use 三菱東京UFJ銀行. Their TTS and TTB spread is only about 2%. Transfer it in batches so you don't get screwed on a particularly unfavorable rate.

America has never monopolized freedom actually. It started off with slaves and no suffrage for women.

$950. Singapore announced adoption, and the price didn't spike up. Think its going to stay at current levels.

You can add a plus to inspect, e.g. 
Maybe someone could create a browser extension that does this automatically.
