Okay so Monero is a currency like bitcoin, this means that you will have to go to monero's website and download a wallet just like bitcoin and create an address, now you have your old bitcoin wallet and a new monero wallet with another adress.
Bitcoin Refund address is your bitcoin wallet public key, the key that is given to someone who wants to purchase something from you, not the private key!
What it does is that if the transaction fails it will refund it back to your bitcoin wallet instead of waiting for support to answer a ticket.
Payment ID is a way to Identify your wallet to the public when using Monero. You can find the explanation here 
And how to create one here: 
Also one last thing, make sure you are browsing the real Shapeshift.io, there are phishing websites especially when you google, the absolute first result that has an advertisement tag next to it is a phishing website aimed at stealing everything so please be careful!

the safest way really would be to use shapeshift.io to convert bitcoins to monero then convert back from monero to bitcoins to a new anonymously created wallet.
this work because its impossible to track any transactions through monero. There is a small fee with using shapeshift but I think for the safety it brings (meaning u dont give some random guy the coins to "tubmle"), its worth it.

personally I find it a shittier version than localbitcoins (if we talking about p2p)
you have options like buying from a reputable instant exchange website or if you are want to be extra careful you could go to localbitcoins and find people who do local face 2 face deals, I find this the safest option because you can both make sure the seller actually gets paid and you actually recieving the bitcoins + the chance that someone actually tries to scam you face 2 face is very minimal and ive never heard about it happening ever.

there are already services like bitconnect which does lending etc if I am not mistaken, I think it works by lending it to others and you get it paid back later with added interest

If its too good to be true then it probably is....

yea but make sure when you google, dont click on the first link that says "advertisement" next to it, almost every search on any major bitcoin site has an advertisement with a phising link on it to steal your coins.
also when you use that site, check their confirmed trades and reputation and always use escrow. Also do check local trades because it might surprise you, even a small city has at least 1+
