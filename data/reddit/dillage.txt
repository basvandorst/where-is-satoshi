I agree, this man may act suspiciously and the article really paints it nicely but if this guy worked on classified stuff he might have bigger skeletons in his closet he's running from.

Couldn't someone use an algorithm to find all unique addresses ever in the block chain and use that as a rainbow table though? There already is a website that has all the private key addresses possible  
Maybe I need to go back to the fundamentals of cryptology and figure out the private key/public key system to understand why. thanks for the response though. I've been a proponent of bitcoin a long time but never went in deeper and been a little busy to research my own questions lately
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:49:29
Doesn't this go against the principle of bitcoin? If you're butt hurt about having coins in Gox it's your own fault for putting your trust in them. Being part of the foundation should advance Mr Karpeles competence in BTC and as a result his exchange as well.

Yes but I wanted to read what you were basing your info on, the articles I was pulling were from the peak of hysteria.
It's very likely the whole system was compromised from an early age but there is only circumstantial evidence that it was Mark Karpele's. That doesn't make it a fact. I'm not sure why people aren't keeping an open eye to other people possibly to blame

The reason I never liked popcorn time is sometimes the videos wouldn't buffer fast enough and as soon as you hit that point you couldn't pause and start again. The stream was ruined. That and when you first connect it kills all your other connections until the proxy loads which can be a while

The reply to this is getting downvoted like crazy but he does bring a point in that the hype went down. You can take it any way you want, it could be a good time to come in because people risks people took to get in as fast as they could resulted in prices driving up like crazy and now that it rebounded it's more stable than ever. It's also possible that the hype was too much hot air in the balloon, it popped and is slowly declining.
Personally as someone who watches the prices daily its hard not to feel that it's slowly bombing because it leveled out at 800 for a while and it was disappointing for it to go down to the mid 600's this week. I started around the 200's and it starting going down, I was regretful at first but that was less than a year ago and we're at high 600's now. Not as cool as 1200 but seriously it's tripled since then!
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:47:42
PR tip, actions speak louder than words. See how you were still downvoted after, like ripplefire said, you needed a more formal response? People are upset with you and every word is wood for the fire that is being placed under you. Corrective actions are the water to douse the flames.
You are being told by the people of the bitcoin community that there's a problem but you feel there is no problem. You can continue on with feeling that way but it wont change the communities opinion of you so good luck being a competitive coin exchange if you aren't serving your users.

One example I can think of is just recently he interviewed with the Canadian Senate and answered all of their questions in a very articulate fashion. He's been talking with the big people for a while now teaching them not to fear or dismiss it. I wish I was near a computer to link a lot of his talks but he's basically been an advocate to very powerful people

Not only that, I had a friend call me last night all panicked because her paypal transaction said "pending until march 19th". Now I know you can do what I have and put a second account on it to have it charge right away but the actual transaction of money being moved from one account to another is just too slow.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:32:05
Well, I hate being the downer here because I do believe in Bitcoin and have put money and work behind my beliefs. There is no "therefore" here, it's a correlation does not imply causation situation. Bitcoin doesn't need propaganda let it's merit speak for it's self

They're probably about as guilty as MtGOX was. Terrible at announcements and dealing with something over their heads. Everyone here screams conspiracy at every corner so it's no wonder these people gave such an over emotional statement, they just didn't want to be thrown under the bus like MtGOX was.
I just want to point out, your points are valid but you have not investigated it fully. You're making a logical conclusion given current knowledge but it really doesn't give you the right to say it with absolute truth that they stole all the money.
I'm sick of all the hearsay in this sub
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:02:53
It is appropriate though because it's related. It's necessary to Bitcoin to discuss things like how it differs from emerging technology that can achieve similar goals. Goals like instantly sending money without massive transaction fee's.

You know I'm slightly dismayed. I understand CoinEx isn't a big BTC exchange but why is this being downvoted? Is this information you feel shouldn't be shared?
For anyone looking for more details I found had a much more [comprehensive story and insightful conversation.](
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:34:48
Not to mention the volume of fiat being spent on BTC doesn't necessarily mean the price will go up. A higher demand does drive prices up but it really only matters how much the buyer and seller agree on in transactions
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:40:45


I wasn't using mtGox so I thought it was only bitcoin. Can you link something proving fiat was taken as well?
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:57:19
So you believe bitcoin needs a payment system?

I would change your mail password again but from a different computer. The only way a hacker can get access to your new email is if he has a backdoor to your PC and monitoring your sessions or more likely has a keylogger somewhere on your system.
Always make sure you're using https when you're connected to your email and cryptsy. Maybe a malware scanner will find the problem
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:03:39
It's not impossible but the guy probably did make enough legit money from running the biggest exchange for a long period. Not to mention business relationships with some pretty big people. It's not like he's the single man behind the site

@_date: 2014-08-25 22:30:12
I'm not saying it wasn't stolen or that Mark Karpeles (whether directly or indirectly) isn't to blame. I refrain from blaming him directly because I don't think he was smart enough to do what people think he did and frankly he wasn't operating site and security alone. There were many investigations into the transaction malleability bug after the crash that showed no signs of widespread use of it. The beauty of a public ledger.
I'm more of a subscriber to the theory that the servers were compromised long before that, slowly draining accounts, audits were not done correctly or at all. By the time they found out they probably thought the only way to survive was to continue operations until they could recover everything but they kept digging deeper and imploded. There's no reason hackers couldn't steal bank info as soon as they had root or admin access. It seems like its been too long but I feel like a large scale investigation ongoing, on the down low, following the data trails because there's no way Karpeles pulled that off without someone finding hard evidence
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:42:41
Yeah I think this might be an overlooked possibility

Vapid is the word of the week apparently.
The funny thing people seem to forget is that the price is based on bargaining. Of course people with the commodity are going to be up selling the value to get a profit. If a farmers market was completely anonymous do you think people would be saying "Oh yeah these tomatoes are going bad soon I'll sell them to you cheaper." No they're thinking about max profit

Hey, I love it! Looks clean, sounds legitimate, supports more than just BTC and nice to see Canada represent in a coin exchange! Couple questions though,

I look forward to seeing the results of the beta testing

SP2 actually caused 30% of my backups to fail and it took 3 days to get through to a high level tech who knew what was going to to tell me that I would have to install an old agent and walked me through getting that from the install DVD. If I had to deal with a middleman once a week to fix some obscure SharePoint or Hyper V issue I think it would be less stressful but slow it right down.
We've already made the call to move away from it. We've had multiple occasions where we went to do a restore from a backup that was listed as successful but zero bytes would restore even though it would run successful and there'd be nothing I could do.
I hope your environment is working with it but mine sure isn't

Along with varying machines uptime and performance another issue is with such low hashrates coming from each cpu is there's probably a lot of stale shares. Unless the newest version of the stratum  protocol is extremely good with load sharing a couple workers over  thousands of distributed cpu's, they probably had very low efficiency.
So they probably didn't make nearly that much and it made the infection obvious so they decided to scrap it

I thought about this after going back to reddit and seeing a throwaway account, yeah. It seemed backwards at first but why shouldn't we force the buyer to be in control.
