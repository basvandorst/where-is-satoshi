Hi! We do indeed ship to USA and you are able to customise the PG:VG ratio when you order :)

Thanks - what do you believe are the advantages over Coinbase?

You can use BFVUSA for 20% off :) valid until 31st October

Indeed! Bitpay has actually been our favourite so far due to the simplicity! No option for other crypto currencies though :(

Oops! My mistake, we used to use Coinbase but have recently switched to GoCoin, and so can accept litecoin. Apologies for the mix-up!

Thanks for taking the time to look at this! I'm on mobile at the moment but when I'm at a PC I'll take a proper look at the links.
I like the tweets idea!
One way or another, we'll find a way to offer a discount for crypto users - I'll DM you and keep you posted :)

Thanks :)! Hope you enjoy Hansel too!

Hi! I've checked a payment by Bitcoin is up and running! I'm on mobile but I've thrown together an album on how to pay. Basically you need to go to Cart, click checkout and select 'Bitcoin, Litecoin, dogecoin'
Hope this helps!

Hi! We're glad you enjoy our juice :) thanks for the kind words.
We do ship internationally so if you need us to hook you up outside the EU, give us a shout! 
We have tried to find a way to offer discount for paying with Crypto but we can't seem to find a way to set a discount for a specific payment type with shopify.
If anyone knows if this can be done, we'd be interested to hear from you!

Thanks! Glad you like it :) 
Ghostberry sounds good! I like raspberry and blueberry and they'll go together well!
From our own range - Gretel (vanilla and butterscotch) is a favourite of mine, as is White Queen (Custard). I'm a big fan of vanilla though. If you prefer a fruity flavour then Four Seasons is nice, fruity but with Brown Sugar to round it off with a different type of sweetness :)

Nope, we ship to most places (anywhere without regulation against shipping eJuice). You can check out pricing [Here]( - if your country isn't in the list, shoot me a message and we'll get you sorted.

The more payment options the better, also I have an interest in Cryptocurrencies. 
Also as says, Credit Card processing companies consider the industry high risk and it's a lot of trouble finding one willing to do business. Paypal has been known to pull accounts too. 
For us only a small % of orders are settled via Crypto, but it's bound to increase as they become more generally accepted. Why not get in early :)

Hi! Sorry for the confusion, I mean 'Vape' more as the act of vaping. Eg 'for those of you who like a drink'
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:14:27
It is :)
