Coins for... loins?

The transaction doesn't propagate so it's as if it didn't take place; you keep the bitcoin.

Good luck to the local police.

The QR code just represents a receiving address which can be generated arbitrarily. Assuming the artist is using new receiving addresses for each piece there's nothing that puts their name next to that address.

Hopefully they find a janitorial service that takes BTC

Just know that there's a chance the transaction won't get processed

I'm sad I missed this. Destroying my decrepit iPhone 4G would have been unbelievably satisfying.

Well one of the great things about bitcoin is that wallets can be generated with absolutely no personal information attached to them and you could generate as many wallets as you want. Where people can get caught are through services where you're either purchasing items for bitcoin and you give an address or where you're exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin where you link a bank account. 
If the authorities look at the blockchain and are able to identify certain addresses to currency exchanges or known merchants then they could theoretically subpoena those businesses and they'd have to hand over whatever information they have. As far as I know this is pretty rare.
But if the artist were to create a wallet on his computer, generate the receiving addresses uniquely for each piece and then post on craigslist or wherever that they're selling BTC for cash then it would be damn near impossible to prove who they were and they'd be able to exchange their bitcoins into a fiat currency with little to no risk.

Assuming this is true I'd like to imagine this went down Swordfish-style in the back of some cyber-themed techno club with armed guards surrounding a table with an aluminum briefcase of money and laptops setup.

This currency is getting a little too legitimate for my liking.

A system like that could work damn near identically to DNS and could operate completely separate from the bitcoin protocol if you got enough developers to adopt it into third party tools. The problem is you'd need to establish some kind of ICANN organization to manage TLD's but I suppose there's a lot of work right now in decentralized DNS that could fix that problem.

A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
