Google the address that sent them to see if that turns anything up. Hold them for a while and see if anyone comes asking for them. If not, sell some for charity or give BTC directly if my charity of choice supported it. Hold maybe about 5 or so.

Pretty sure you can unit test static methods.

I'd say that 4.5% of the world population was a pretty small test, but I take your point as obv. a good chunk of the rest of the world doesn't have decent electricity or internet.

Theres enough redundancy in a QR that you could probably extract more than 50% of the bits from any one half. The OPs method is essentially a one time pad mechanism so gives nothing away at all until you have both parts.

It's been there since at least when I signed up with them, about three months ago.

Isn't the after effect more the other way round? That the machine thinks it is in stock, tries to vend, but is actually out of stock?

I'm sure it will be an honest mistake that they've just not had the time to deal with, but good luck!

Yes. I've also done business (although not Bitcoin related) with companies in Spain, France, Iceland, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Ukraine, Armenia and probably others that don't immediately come to mind. I only speak English. It certainly adds friction to the transactions and when there is a problem (like currently) then issues can be harder to solve. But it doesn't automatically put me off.

Am I right in thinking they could save some fees by paying out to multiple recipients in the same TX?
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:42:17
Indeed, it's actually not that ridiculous. When I want to send from my exchange or desktop to my mobile device there is no way to easily copy the address from the phone to the computer. I key it right maybe 90% of the time and when the checksum fails then it's usually just one character that needs adjusting.

Indeed, and as I commented below it's also pretty bad to let the full 48hrs run out and then say that it's going to take longer when it should have been possible to make the revised estimate beforehand.

Spoken to Bitstamp?
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:13:59
Just throwing this out there but they are Slovenian, what you're saying is "Writes in local language, doesn't have time to get it translated", which makes sense.
However, the lack of frequent updates from them is appalling and they really should have the resources for this!

It is certainly not the cheapest. I know the prices vary all the time but currently:-
Bittylicious cash option: £196.55/BTC
Kraken: €233/BTC (£182.40/BTC)
But, it is certainly more convenient if you only wanted to transact a small amount, any savings from Kraken could be wiped out by bank fees and whatever price you put on the hassle of sorting ID with the exchanges.
I don't always buy with the cheapest methods. I normally use Kraken or Bitstamp (and now we see an additional hidden cost to doing that), but have used the bank transfer options on Bittylicious a few times because faster payments means I can then have the coins inside a couple of hours instead of waiting days for international transfer.
Good to know that the cash option was painless, I am in London so I imagine there will be a shop near me that I can do it from, perhaps I'll give it a go soon. Thank you.

I'd be careful storing anything sensitive on it. Store some wallet keys on there if you want them to get stolen.

Care to elaborate? (Honest question)
I've never used it apart from to convert a few LTC early last year.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:08:48
I think a lot of miners that had been regularly selling held back while bitstamp was down and now its back up have a large stack of coins that they have to dump.

They can still take a few minutes to provision. Fine if you're anticipating load but if you suddenly get more load than you are currently provisioned for then you can still have issues. Given that you only have to pay for them by the hour though, I wouldn't be surprised if they spin up more than they could possibly ever need. We'll see!
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:29:45
Estimation with a range implies that it will be at least 24hrs and less than 48hrs but that they just don't know where within that range it will be. Also, if you get to about 36hrs or so and it still looks like it's going to take longer then best to put an update announcement.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:58:33
I withdrew about the same time as you made your post and got it fine. Good luck!

Similar experience buying things paying with BTC in two different London branches and the Nottingham branch.
In both London branches the staff didn't know how to do it. The first one the lady had to phone up someone else who talked her through it, initially I felt bad because I was only buying quite a low value item (and mainly to test them) and it can't have been worth the time that it took for them but the lady did seem grateful and told me at least now she knows how to do it next time.
Exactly the same thing happened in a different London branch that I tried except it took even longer and since the screen didn't swivel round the operative had to take my phone and scan the QR code which I generally felt uneasy about but it turned out ok.
In the Nottingham one I was told that I was the second customer to pay with BTC. The first customer then was my friend who I got into BTC and who had spend some there a few weeks earlier, they seemed to know a bit better what they were doing.
Keep at it I say. It doesn't seem to be very well integrated with their existing POS but it can only improve as the staff learn how to do it. Each time they seemed generally interested in it and keen to learn how to do it on the system, were courteous about it and didn't really make me feel like I was being awkward or anything.

Isn't 0.1PB = 100TB?
