What you say holds true only if you bought at the all time high 3 months ago. If you bought BTC a year ago, you're still in the green with a very nice profit if you sold right now.

Draw a straight line from January last year and it's going up.

Well... it should be difficult to find an exchange where you can sell for FIAT currencies without verification and for good reason.

Nothing out of the ordinary. In regards to crypto currencies, this is normal fluctuation.

Something really strange happened to me earlier today: one of my smaller sell-orders triggered today at 7250€/BTC... I mean, I'm not complaining, I just don't understand why anyone would buy at that price-point right now.
Any ideas?

Same here, I started investing in crypto early last year. But diversification is key. In my crypto-portfolio, about 75% is stored in BTC. And out of my total savings, only a third is invested in crypto. It's always a good idea to make sure you land on your feet, in case things go south.

Not necessarily. In a residence with electric heating it would cost nothing to keep the rig running in winter (as the electric heater would  need to do less work while the rig is producing heat as well).
With zero impact on the electricity bill with a few units of crypto-currency on top doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.

It depends on how you have configured your Nicehash account. If you are using the internal wallet, you need to transfer your rewarded BTC into an exchange in order to sell them.
If you have given Nicehash an existing (external) wallet address, you'll receive the rewarded BTC periodically and automatically (but that can take a while, as the neccessary amount is relatively high).

That kind of rendering is actually quite impressive...

This! Also, trading on GDAX works potentially without fees if you use limit orders... if you want your feet wet on crypto-trading, take your time to read how GDAX works and play around with small amounts until you get the hang of it. @_date: 2018-04-02 08:37:49
There you go. Happy reading and happy easter !

With such a small investment, you may not have much to gain, but not much to loose either.

There are very few French beers. Most beers in French supermarkets are from Belgium or the Netherlands.
It's more of a wine producing country.
