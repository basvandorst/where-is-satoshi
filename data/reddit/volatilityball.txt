S&amp;P is right there in the sentence.  The "or" is that the price is calculated by some mysterious black box; that's also bullshit.  The only thing that's closed door about the S&amp;P 500  is the inclusion process.

okay, here's an eli5: op posts blog. blog says s&amp;p and other indices have their price set by black box proprietary formulas.  he's wrong. i say so.  you get all uppity and rustled.  i give you a lollipop and you settle down for a nap. 
i'll answer any questions you might have.

if what I said is wrong give me a reason.  that's some defensive nonsense right there.

so, is homeless *or* he has a home. including something you know is wrong is a lazy way to prove a point.  
who cares about it being proprietary? the various weightings are public knowledge.  the only control Standard and Poors has is in choosing what companies to include.  those modifications are glacial so it ain't no thang. 
the point is OP is pushing a shitty solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

LOL, the author claims SPX is priced via a  "clunky Excel spreadsheet."  What the fuck is he smoking?  Any  discrepancy between SPX and the basket of stocks it represents is arbitraged away by automated systems.  This post is 95% up-voted - yall should be ashamed of yourselves.
