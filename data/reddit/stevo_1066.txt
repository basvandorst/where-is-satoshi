You almost sound like you know what you're talking about! (LOL NOPE)


There you go with that Ad Hominem again! How old are you sport? Didn't they teach you a *thing* in school about debate? Or English class at least?
Well, I guess you can take comfort in knowing that I won't be calling you an inbred, a moron, a hipster, stupid, or any other pejorative that you can think of, because I don't stoop that low!
Have some class, kid! You seem to need[ it](

Would you like me to actually address your story, tell you what you did wrong, why it was wrong, and why people reacted the way they did? Or are you gonna brush it off?
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:33:39


You must be a child. Or have the mind of one. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:59:49


I'm gonna lol when it burns down with you in it. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:12:55
I hope you live the rest of your years as miserable as you are now, you piece of shit. You're a bigot.

I think you've lost the argument, bud. Ad hominem. 
Thanks for reminding me how close minded and puritan the population still is. Still equating law with morality. 
It's adorable!

Thanks for answering my question.

The main difference between this and your example there is that victimless crimes have occurred. The mafia isn't about victimless crimes. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:46:46
Did you even read what happened? It was a setup.
Even if it wasn't a setup, fuck whoever is going to try to extort someone else, with the leverage of ruining THOUSANDS of peoples' lives for a hobby.
Those people can die painful deaths for all I care. 
InB4 elton here bleeds his feels on me.

Let's get down to tacks here.
If one person was going to ruin the lives of thousands of people for personal gain, then why would it be wrong to eliminate them? Would it not be for the greater good to save the lives of countless innocent people?
Your appeal is from an emotional, moralistic perspective is it not? I would contend that it is moral to remove this imaginary person if it would save thousands of lives. 
Please, explain to me your position so that I might better understand your hesitance.

Why do you have so much hate for trans people? Does the notion of a man transitioning to a woman make you uncomfortable? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:50:44
Yet you can't even muster a single argument. All you got is mud slinging. 
I can call you a tortoise face, but it doesn't mean a thing unless I make an argument for it. So you just gonna keep on calling names, like this is kindergarten?

Please, tell me about how the war on drugs is the moral alternative.

The law of this nation is the will of the few imposed over the many.
Many here do not believe in the rule of law provided by our... benefactors. Our judicial system is a joke, and there is no justice within it. 
Fuck the law. Law and the governments that fabricate it draw their power from the people. We the people do not consent to their draconian drug laws, and we the people have gone around the government. We are not bad people for breaking your laws, you are bad people for enslaving us with them.

Objective. Yeah, they're horrible people for buying drugs online, keeping that underground economy off the streets. 
Please, tell me about how breaking someone else's law on what I can put in my body makes me a bad person. Please! 
In a nutshell, this can be whittled down to one person seeking to ruin the lives of thousands of innocent people for their own profit. Death is really a viable solution in this situation. In fact, it's almost the only one.

Oh my god, a fallacy bot! THIS IS WONDERFUL! :D

Have a good night.

I shouldn't have expected much from a trans* phobe like you. You're an intolerant jackass who will get what's coming to him when you least expect it. What a waste of a fucking life. You should be ashamed of yourself you shit stain. 
Enjoy your sad fucking life.

I don't actually think it's as bad as it might seem.
Someone's threatening to effectively destroy your life and risk outing thousands upon thousands of people peacefully using a site? I don't think it's so bad to take them out of the picture. They fired the first shots. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:37:11
I think it's quite different.
