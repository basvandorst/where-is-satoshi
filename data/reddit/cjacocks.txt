Been trading crypto for a year now and I literally don’t know how to make a limit order on coinbase.

HA, USD Wins!
Bitcoin = $10,000  USD
Bitcoin = £9,000  EUR

Wait a few hours and I think it will go down before going to 10k by tomorrow. But make your own decision, no one can see the future (except the bitcoin time traveler)��

I just bought a little bit of gold when I was depressed about the bitcoin winter but in my opinion it’s not a great investment, my money hasn’t really changed.

Yes, In the year 2140, but about 99% will be mined by 2038.

You’ll need ur parents help and use coinbase. It’s very easy, I’m 13 and bought my own with it.
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:12:17
Wonder what year that’s from
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:22:51
Can’t blame you, I thought I was a genius when I bought more when it went down to 8.1k
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:08:18
Oh it’s a candle chart��
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:30:22
100k just after halving then down to 60k then slowly up to 5 mil by 2025

Whenever you buy on coinbase the buy price is $50 than the actual price and the sell price is $50 lower that the actual price. I believe they do this to limit people trying to day trade.

Bought at the lowest point yesterday at 8100
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:24:55
Not any point in thinking that way. You will be much richer if you hold a few months or years.

Not really, I knew that a big support level was at $8,000 and when I saw it hit that then rise like $50 I knew that was my chance.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:06:46
That’s what happened to me

@_date: 2019-06-04 01:33:02
��ok buddy
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:15:01
6400-6500 about
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:35:59
Because less supply and more demand
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:56:25
@_date: 2019-06-01 13:48:55
Research where the support levels are then when it drops down to it I usually buy more
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:23:55
Oh lol. Thx
