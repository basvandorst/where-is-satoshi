SEPA is indeed free where I live (Netherlands).

You're right, the quicker option is a bit more expensive. Kraken is competitively priced because of arbitrage though.

Ok, I see. Here in The Netherlands all ATMs of all banks are free to use, although the daily limit is lower at other banks than your own. You can also use an ATM of a different bank only once a day. Those are the only differences between an ATM of your own bank and a different one.

You can see your trade history in the leaked database, but unfortunately only until november 2013. 
(PM me your user ID and I'll take a look.)

I like it!

Do ATMs really have fees in the US? Lol, your country is even more fucked up than I thought.

None, although I use Kraken, not Bitstamp. I can fund my account there within a day through SEPA. But, more importantly, I can also buy through Bitonic directly with my bank account, using iDeal, and have the Bitcoins within minutes, which is much easier than using coinbase.

The new licence also forbids you from using a modified version.

What happened with RN? I didn't know they'd stopped the plans. Is there a link to more info?
