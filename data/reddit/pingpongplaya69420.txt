It’s anonymity online you clown. Nobody gives a shit. It was a throwaway pronoun and you needed to pout how I misgendered you. You could have easily moved on, but you didn’t.

Yes because I need to be grateful to you

Get off your high horse, my guy. You’re actually making a mountain out of a mole hill. Nobody cares

This was clever. However the next bull run will retrace, and id cash out just to buy the next dip

My guy, you can’t just do it when mass adoption and the infrastructure to operate smoothly as a business entity isn’t there. I buy a rental property from a guy with bitcoin, fine I’ll give you that’s possible. Then I collect rent from my tenants in bitcoin, also possible. However how am I going to pay federal corporate income tax in bitcoin? How am I going to pay property tax in bitcoin? Insurance all things that aren’t accepting bitcoin as payment now

Just because of your last paragraph, I’ve lost more faith in humanity. My guy is New York slang for dude/ bro/ it’s gender inclusive

Ok let’s assume bitcoin reaches $300,000 by December 2021. Mass adoption is still taking its time. I want to buy a house. How would someone receive bitcoin as legal tender and exchange that for a legal deed or even apply for a mortgage?
