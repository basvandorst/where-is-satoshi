Have you tried both?
When I started experiencing eye strain symptoms, I gave f.lux a try for a couple of weeks and saw no improvement. Wearing GUNNAR Optiks fixed my symptoms within a day.

I wrote a module to allow bitcoin payment without a third party for OpenCart. If you aren't too locked in to prestashop, check OpenCart out. It also handles the exchange rate.
My module is open sourced at

Hey, I don't want to be *that guy*, but spending bitcoins without any track record, proof of identity, or confirmation of capacity to fill the orders is kinda dangerous. I placed an order but before sending my coins looked to find *any* information about who is behind this and ended up disappointed.
Look, there's a real good chance that OP is not a scammer, but it would be nice if there was something--*anything*--that points to a trustworthy individual behind this, and I'm not finding it.
I would love to exchange .25 BTC for a Raspberry Pi, but I'm holding onto my coins for now.
Edit: prettied up the text some.

If you lose your private keys, you will never recover your bitcoins without a computer ["built from something other than matter and \[occupying\] something other than space."]( This is why it's so important to back up your wallet.

Yesterday I put the bulk of my coins in cold storage. I wouldn't call it superhuman security as it took less than an hour to implement, but nobody's getting the coins without physical access and a password, so I feel pretty good about that.
Everybody, DO THIS. Attacks against bitcoiners are going to become more prevalent and more sophisticated. Also, one bonus is you don't have to keep checking your wallet to make sure your coins are still there every five minutes.

Coinbase is a service in beta built on top of a technology that is also in beta. I haven't personally had any significant issues with their service, but I don't think they're ready for prime time yet.

Bitcoins are currently valued at how much fiat people are willing to pay for them. Whether the buyers and sellers factor lost coins into their valuations is immaterial.
The bottom line in Bitcoin valuation is that the coins will likely either be worth much more than they are now or nothing.
Lost coins really only become relevant when people attempt to calculate the [Bitcoin market capitalization]( by multiplying coins mined against current trading value. Estimates of market capitalization are likely too high.
