No. Wall st has the money. Giving them access to this market is a good thing.

When you're doing it on the scale of a major player, you act more carefully. There are literally billions of $ of value being held for millions of people. You don't just hack something together in a day.

arbitrage. ETF buys futures. futures price increases. someone sells futures and buys bitcoin spot.
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:19:02
probably because the CFTC is easier to deal with than the SEC who may be interested in a spot exchange.

People running BU nodes are passionate about Bitcoin and seeing it realize its original vision of on-chain scaling. This is all you need to know to explain why the nodes come back online quickly.

Well pardon me for setting up a new reddit account. Since when does the age of a reddit account matter?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:22:11
What kind of logic is this?
One side wants 8MB+ blocks, therefore it isn't a compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:12:59
I see we're making progress. Admitting it's worth study is an important step in recognizing its value.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:19:00
less than 1% of bitcoin users are bitcoin devs. How can their views possibly represent the majority?
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:48:14
BU doesn't want to decide. The miners and community at large will decide.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:46:00
Hmm.. I wonder why? Maybe r/btc is full of people who were here but were violently silenced when their views didn't match the party line.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:19:36
Wrong. Miners and investors are the sole determiner of hard forks. Core has no say.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:13:25
What if you're wrong? What if bigger blocks aren't the devil? What if utility trumps decentralization?

Why do you fear that? If you have btc keys you'll have 2x coins as well.
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:09:39
your analysis doesnt give enough consideration to the difficulty of purchasing BTC vs an ETF. An ETF is markedly easier to purchase for a very large number of people. This convenience breeds a premium. Look at GBTC.
Any premium the ETF has should be arbitraged away, but that will bring the market up to a new equilibrium.
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:40:20
Or is it economic naiveté that causes you to interpret his message as an attack?
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:33:41
Dude, relax. Not all BU supporters or r/btc'ers are idiots. How about some respect for your fellow bitcoiner.
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:53:52
Not cool. Why are you alienating people?
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:27:01
Or did they trick you? Hmmmm

This isn't a war. We all want the same thing, and that's not total annihilation of Bitcoin.

Stop generalizing and dividing people up, please. I identify as a member of both bitcoin communities and am very sympathetic to Core's and Core supporters' concerns. I'm also much more bullish on Bitcoin than any other coin.
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:01:02
This is so against the spirit of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is permissionless and people should be able to access it however they want. Don't like an ETF? Don't use it. Don't tell other people they can't though. That's crazy
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:37:21
And 1x will survive with what hash rate exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:14:53
I see the problem now. Let's starve the fucker. /s

Relative strength vs USD is how we measure winning. It's also a good proxy to measure how many bigmacs we can buy.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:24:18
To you, perhaps. To those who just want exposure it's not clear.
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:57:23
Reliably and provably scarce money? Ever consider not everyone values the same aspects of bitcoin as you?
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:58:36
Now this is funny
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:37:16
I'm dead serious. Step out of your echo chamber, friend.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:16:09
Core devs, it's not too late to add your support to the NYA and keep bitcoin whole.
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:17:52
When the heck did bitcoins become core coins? Core is the reference client but hardly defines bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:34:47
Bcash was a new coin. 2x is bitcoin. Very different situations. The spirit of the NYA lives on.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:00:17
Well aren't you nice
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:39:54
A bitcoin ETF with zero bitcoin holdings is a beautiful thing. I wish people would stop bashing it. It's a natural first step for the maturation of the market.
Here's why. It has a realistic shot of being approved. It's a fund that contains regulated contract interests.
It's a financial product that works by allowing participants bet against each other. Agreements between people and capital at stake makes the thing work. The contract settles according to reliable pricing data. People are only allowed to remain in the contract as long as they are solvent.

Good thing people aren't in charge of Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:07:42
Do you understand that addresses don't have balances? Hmm? Bitcoin is stored in UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). Why don't you grok that and then get back to me?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:34:54
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:56:34
Oh dear lord. Save us from 2-8mb's of capacity. The horror!
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:27:15
Give me a break. Are you king and arbiter of what's appropriate Bitcoin use?
Circumstances change. Get off your high horse. No such thing a spam. Bitcoin makes no judgment.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:21:01
You're assuming they care about privacy when maybe they just want to manage denominations for future spends. Why is it that bitcoiners are so quick to assume they know everything and anyone who disagrees is being malicious?
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:36:36
Well perhaps the reason it's not a crucial aspect of managing finances is that it's too risky. Options allow parties to redistribute risk. It's critical for Bitcoin to develop these markets if it's going to become a mature part of the economy.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:15:30
When it comes time to spend, your wallet grabs a UTXO, not an address. These are just basic protocol details, my friend.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:57:39
Because it's extremely reckless if miners aren't signalling for SegWit
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:28:40
Actually, I'm not. We have a security team for that. Nice concern troll job.
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:24:55
It's a simpler system with less complexity and fewer moving parts.
The main advantage though is adoption and all that comes along with it. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:35:31
good for them. bitcoin doesn't judge intent. bitcoin is impartial.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:30:44
Or they want smaller outputs for future use...
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:10:18
How disingenous to say that the tx/block is essentially unlimited. We are capped in a very real and very big way by channel openings and closings to allow any meaningful number of people to enter and exit the system. Oh sure it's unlimited for people set up with LN, but way more people are not set up with LN than are and that will be the case probably forever.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:18:49
Yes, UTXOs are what need to be organized. Not addresses. You're getting it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:15:37
Slow and cautious is one thing. This thing is frozen and it needs some space to breathe new air into it. It's an economic system lest we forget and right now there is very little room for expansion. With more on chain space, we have more room for activities. Just think about that. And consider whether all engineers really believe that 1mb is the right answer for today (or November). Or did the engineers that disagree get shoved out with personal attacks?
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:49:26
Say what? Bitcoin cash is a new/alternative plot line of Bitcoin history. It's irrelevant to the topic at hand.
Bitcoin proper is ready for a 2mb HF. It had widespread community consensus and Greg is just burying his head in the sand and covering his ears. Greg, care to chime in?
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:06:28
You didn't already know that? Full color baby!
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:29:02
Todd obviously
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:27:50
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:27:50
Greg, why do you believe this when ~100% of the hash rate is ready for 2mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:03:29
Sure, theoretically if ecdsa is broken.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:34:44
Umm, in the direction of community consensus. SW2X has the most support any scaling proposal has ever had
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:02:36
Maybe they're not trying to fire the core devs??? Maybe they just want to push Bitcoin forward based on consensus?
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:02:06
Because 100% of the hashrate and many exchanges have all hopped on board with the plan. This is a much more serious attempt to HF than we've ever seen before
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:13:15
Go for it
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:07:54
which is why he's okay with it now.
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:52:07
Bitcoin Cash is just another alt. GDAX lists very few alts.

No, bip148 followers are forking off a new alt on August 1st
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:12:50
Do you? Bip148 forcefully rejects all non signalling blocks. It is not backwards compatible and is essentially a hard fork the way it is being talked about being deployed.

False, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the US outside of the great lakes, drains through the Truckee River into Pyramid lake. This makes the Truckee Meadows (Reno) much greener than many expect. Nevada also has significant water rights to the Colorado River.

Can you refute any of this?
