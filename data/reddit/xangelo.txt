As (our benevolent co-founder) has stated our relationship with BMO is pretty solid. I'm not sure if BMO made the announcement earlier this week or if it was just the exchange.. but I'm willing to bet that it was the latter...

Actually, it doesn't: 
There are a number of methods that don't require verification and are entirely public. The ones that DO require verification are endpoints that allow you to maniuplate balances (IE, deposit, withdraw, trade)
You can find a full list here: 
But here are a few public endpoints at the time of writing
- /public/ticker
- /public/orderbook
- /public/currency
- /public/recent_transactions
Each of those have a corresponding link in the API for additional documentation.
In addition, each have an equivalent "restricted" endpoint (IE: /info/ticker) which you can call if you have API keys.

// Please note that although I AM a VoS employee, this response is from me personally - as a digital currency believer.
Honestly, the first two are the biggest reasons. If we screw this up, we lose a lot of credibility as a company - and that's a huge risk to take. I'd feel even worse because I was the one that brought up doing the whole Proof of Solvency stuff and I'd feel personally responsible. Not just to VoS but to all of our customers :/ 
Unfortunately, as stated, this doesn't stop an exchange from completely running away with currency. However, and I really liked the idea of publishing cold wallet addresses. The reason being that with a third party audit there is some delay and a fair bit of overhead as the exchange grows. I imagine that audits would probably take place quarterly, or monthly at BEST. Gives you some time to syphon things off.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not railing on the exchanges who went the audit route - honestly, as a company I think that is the safest way to go to protect yourself. I just like to think VoS is in the business of protecting our customers first and if that means sleepless nights for me then so be it. I know as a customer, that's what I want.

Hiya, yep - it's just in review right now and the goal is to have it all documented and ready to go with the next release!

Hey, PM me and we can talk about charting! Right now, frankly, it could use a bit of work (or a lot of work :/)..

Virutal office for virtual currency. Makes perfect sense.

We do have a unit in these buildings - the one of the left actually. We're further to the back and aren't visible from the road. The "Storage unit" look has to do with the fact that each unit has a garage that opens up between the sets of buildings.

our Director of Marketing will post over in and then xPost throughout subs that may be affected whenever we have any announcement.

Nevada and South Carolina the two states that are exempt from the current discussion as the requirements a little less stringent there.

Glad you like it :D Thanks for trading with us.

Confirmed - the only thing that is being halted is actual trading and verifications. All non-fiat transactions will take place as previously, all US dollars will be transferred back to those living in the US. 
You are free to move non-fiat in and out. I know some of our users use our online wallets as addresses for mining pools, so this change won't affect any of them.

If you ever mentioned "Vault of Satoshi" we're watching ;)

The rate increase was very recent (I believe it was only over the weekend that it happened)
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:56:05
It's really ugly isn't it? I'm not a big fan of it myself, but I had to get it up asap. As part of our design review that's coming up a lot of things will hopefully get sorted out.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:54:34
Once I was verified - couldn't you just steal  my wallet and then all transactions would look like they're coming from me?
Edit: 
Heck, a few people could verify and then bid off their wallets to others for fiat/crypto.

Some more information about the VoS Proof of Solvency
- 
- 
While other exchanges have attempted to implement their own variant of the Proofs, VoS is the first to actually implement it acccording to the current standard. 
In addition, I think VoS was the first one that posted up the cold wallet addresses instead of just verifying a transaction on the blockchain. 
If anyone has any more questions about the Proofs, I'd be more than happy to give you as much detail as you require. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:19:06
I wouldn't say that it's their choice to have such laws. The majority of people have no say in what happens. It's just a really shitty situation for everyone involved.

We do support full trading in both USD and CAD
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:07:34
We have a section that lists all the rates for trades (Variable rate trade volumes)  
You can find the withdrawal fees under the "Withdraw Funds" tab on the "Deposit and Withdraw" section.

Thanks for the vote of confidence!

Hi there - we actually do have random selections for followup verifications. I'll be honest, I don't really have much to do with the manual portion of the verification/follow-up  process - but I know that it does happen from time to time.
Edit: 
Due to some security concerns and the appearance of phishing emails, we are looking into pulling all contact info out of the email to get users to go to the site and get the info from there, and also pgp signatures on all outbound emails. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:59:05
That functionality is being tested and developed as we speak =)
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:43:17
The price will probably change.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:13:37
If you have any ideas, we're always open to hearing them and figuring out how we can incorporate user suggestions into the exchange.

Woo for doing it right! +50 doge

We've gotten this from a few people - it's definitely something that's on the list - sooner rather than later.
