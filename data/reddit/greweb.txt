Don't you have to pay tax only if you sell ��

My understanding:
It would change to the amount of Bitcoin your wallet had at that time *unless* you broadcast all the blocks that you know happened between 2010 and 2019. That would be a hell of a crash tho because you can expect people would think Bitcoin has been hacked like the difficulty is not doing its job/someone found a way to bypass it��‍♂️

he basically says “you wouldn’t buy currency of an unstable government” (talking about Irak). Yet he compares bitcoin with it��
Well technically bitcoin is more stable than dollars in a sense that it can’t be control, new money can’t be injected and its network will not stop (unless internet dies)
Is there something I’m missing here?

some journalists here in France call it like this (in French), can barely say it correctly.
@_date: 2018-08-18 05:51:01
Is it even legal? In France it is not, only Euro can be used for salary.

This is literally a proverb in French "mettre les bâtons dans les roues" (put stick in wheel) which is close to the English  "shoot yourself in the foot" except also apply from someone else (someone undermine your actions)

I know that I know nothing but it's hard to tell if I'm at the left or the right of the graph ��

I don't think it's only about the time you generate it (it's pretty well known this is something to be careful about) but it's mainly about how do you secure the transfer out of it? As soon as you enter your private key on a computer it's pretty much compromised (e.g. keystroke logger. These can be implemented in a virus, in a hardware (like in the cables), over the radio frequency,..)

Can't unsee this

Only the part that is under NDA with the secure element provider. The rest is completely open sourced.

if you add the current price of BCH and BTG and assuming you had BTC before the 2 forks, we are almost here :D

RIP bitcoin cash

It's over 9000€ !!

:D Sure about this? RemindMe! 2 years

why the obstinacy to argue on what "Satoshi wanted" and not focusing on building the future? No one can speak for himself so who knows what he would say know.
the whole argument holds on a "guess" that want satoshi wanted but who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:48:42
Couldn’t you wait it reach 10k at least? :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:55:51
9k€ reached :o

What's sure is the attack surface is wider so it's intrinsicly riskier. I wonder how easy would it be to compromise the firmware or the OS/malware app to attack this.
 It's still very interesting to see this developed more and more.

Distribution per crypto will be shipped in next release.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:44:08
On firmware 1.4.2 ? It definitely should work.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:55:03
- Portfolio total on BTC =&gt; next release
- Send MAX =&gt; being working on, soon
- dark theme: could eventually happen but it's a lot of work to redo all the screens and especially the images and assets.
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:50:59
Genuinely question but why would they want to do that?
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:33:01
Well, people are free to contribute, we are open source. We have many things to work on in our roadmap before addressing ourself dark theme but we would happily accept open source contribution.
Also, we do have a console version, still minimal and experimental but it works: 
You can even install apps with it, everything the live can do can be done on the terminal now.
