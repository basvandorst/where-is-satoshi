More precisely, that's one of the few existing laws that can be applied to Bitcoin.  
Next on the list might be "changeur manuel" ( money changer ) and what will never be on the list is "holding bitcoins for someone needs a license".
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:30:56
Not if you sell directly your bitcoins or euros.  
If you get paid by making a buyer and a seller meet and process their money for a trade then you need a license.

But how would one rig elections then ?

Would you mind considering showing some of it ?

You should so much.

I read some ot the law texts a few months ago, and it seems that holding money on behalf of anyone is an activity that needs to be licensed.  
When a seller and a buyer meet at your place, and the buyer hands you money that you hand to the seller, then get the bitcoins from him that you hand to the buyer, you are an intermediary.

Non.  
ACPR states that the intermediary processing euros or any currency in the context of a Bitcoin buy/sale must be registered as such.  
So an exchange can have a registered partner handling all the payments in order to respect the statement.

Time told already two things:  
* government FUD's first  
* lobbies help  
  
Chances are that when a country catches new markets before others, they will defend them. Today, it seems to me that USA will make bitcoin mainstream, because they have the biggest economy around this cryptocurrency. China backing out goes in that direction too.  
Your question is a bit too early.
