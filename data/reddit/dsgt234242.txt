stop thinking that 'cause they are.. and if one happens your account will probably get closed as well as losing the money.

Not really, although there may be some exceptions.. you could try selling on localbitcoins.com for deposit to the account for instance.. the problem is that you may have difficulty checking if they actually made the deposit. A lot of exchanges don't require security deposits before adding a withdrawal bank account.. so you could try pretending the account is yours and do a withdrawal.. it might work, of course if it doesn't you're probably stuffed.

It works with faster payments. The biggest problem ATM is that there's nobody to trade with.. You can book an order and wait though. There probably isn't much the arbiter can do if you get charged back so its still quite risky.

The reason for getting a business account is because if you're doing hundreds of transactions on a personal account it will get shut down. 
AFAIK there are no banks that will give you the ok to run a bitcoin business so you'll have to tell them some other story. 
They may eventually shut you down but then you just open an account somewhere else.. it's the nature of the game.
BTW, as of today fidor does have proper account numbers and FP but it's still a bit slow (perhaps not suitable for quick localbitcoins transactions)

maybe using wirexapp.com or some other bitcoin debit card.. add the card or virtual card to your paypal.. deposit and withdraw funds to/from your bitcoin debit card acct and from there to/from bitcoin.

Well it'd be pretty much the same, except maybe not against circle's tos (not sure) - and also it may be harder to hack and also harder to charge back than paypal. If they handle disputes in a sensible way (ie, not allowing obvious fraudsters to get away with it) it might be quite useful and the prices people offer could be lower and more in line with other markets. 
The other thing that occurs to me is that lots of bitcoin users currently have circle accounts that are now basically useless. If it turns out that circle doesn't judge fairly and just closes the seller's accounts when someone defrauds them - well at least they didn't lose their paypal account (or bank account etc) that maybe they use for other things and not want to risk losing.

Basically what happens is someone's bank account gets hacked. The hacker sends you the money and then the legit account holder demands their money back. The banks will oblige and they will also suspect the recipient of being involved.. once you mention bitcoin they will probably understand what happened, but then they close your account.

Hi Mark, I wonder if you noticed my [post]( to about the tsb cash account. It seems as though it might be useful for your platform.

No, everyone's savings will be tied up in payment channels on their lightning node earning transaction fees.

There are quite a few debit/credit card options (cex.io, blockchain.info, 247exchange.com, indacoin.com, coincorner.com to name a few) but none of them have fees comparable to circle's or the smooth signup process and you'd likely be better off using localbitcoins instead in most cases. There isn't really anything comparable to what circle offered.

I'm guessing you don't know the bic/iban info for your bank account. Ask your bank.. Then I think its fairly obvious what to do with it. You can withdraw GBP or EUR but if you withdraw EUR your bank will probably take about 3% to convert it to GBP. If it's a small amount this may not matter and could even be cheaper than the kraken withdrawal fee for GBP.

I would recommend getting a  smart current account.. then you can easily and cheaply move money to any european bitcoin exchanges. 
Fidor charges £2.49 to send SEPA transfers and work well with kraken.com as they use the same bank (fidor germany) to receive deposits. 
You can also use other european exchanges such as bitstamp.net zyado.com, belgacoin.com and probably many others.

NATd nodes are useless to each other but still useful to non NATd nodes.
