Sorry I'm just getting back to this, I had to work all day yesterday.  I'll try to elaborate.  I posted when I was trying to fall asleep, but I was too drunk and stuck awake thinking.
I'm not so much referring to viruses taking advantage of existing blockchains as much as viruses that have their own decentralization programmed into them in order to synchronize their attack without direct command, but this led me to think maybe something about this actually is how you attack another decentralized program.  Blockchains supposedly can't be attacked because of how they are spread and use this to determine whomst is legitimate.  But what if you could attack the spread elements (the nodes?) in a synchronized manner?  The only function the decentralized part of the virus has to perform is to check with itself "how propagated am I?".  It would be a long slow process waiting for it to discretely spread on its own, but clearly hackers are patient fellows.  Then when it checks as having a wide enough spread it can send the signal to activate soon after at a specific time.  What exactly it would do, I'm not sure.  Change the transaction send addresses all at once?  Two of you have pointed out this is at least a potential way for a virus to keep itself from being completely taken down, so long as its technically optimal.  Maybe another decentralization method other than blockchain?  I saw an altcoin Aidos Kuneen that said it had a non-blockchain system called imesh, but it looks like a scam coin?
Anyway if this is a topic at least meriting more discussion I can feel even better about my drinking.
