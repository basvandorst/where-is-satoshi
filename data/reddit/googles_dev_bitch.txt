Why not just charge for it?  It's the most ethical thing to do, really, from one software dev to another - you're only screwing yourself.  Although you might think this is upfront, it's only you justifying it,  It's not when looking at the reality of it.
That one question has not been answered, but has been asked many times in this thread - WHY NOT JUST CHARGE UP FRONT FOR IT?
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:09:19
I think you are mistakenly advocating for the latter - have a good day!
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:56:35
If they aren't is a position to pay up front, what's your logic that they can over time?  In my view, it only would be "not as noticeable", but the math adds to the same number, no?
I'm not here to convince you - do what you want, but take heed in the outcry.  I struggle with in-app payments, but your choice is off my ethical charts.

Thanks for the assumption, I do read.  I'm speaking of the end user.  Only when they get TAGGED, will they go back and read the policy, and by then, you've lost the user.....
It's not a matter of illiteracy, it's of practicality.

Halsey talked about money being people's money, the government...  Not sure why a smart man such as halsey doesn't do the simple homework to find out The Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express; A Private Corporation.
I've had a bitreserve account from the start.  This video urged me to play with it a bit.  I like it, and will continue to use it.

I don't know about 10x, but I would pay for it - if it had value to me.  But inserting yourself into a private transaction? no - I'm over banks.
If the software had value, then charge for it, right? if it has value - what's the problem?  To take money AFTER it's been transfered in, because some legal document says they can?  This behavior is exactly what banks do.  Bitcoin is the anti-bank - it's just not that hard to see, is it?
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:02:15
I think that's pretty dirty, just change for you software for fuck sakes... why bury the fact in an agreement and blog posts that no one reads.... nice....

When you pay for something up front - it's all seen, agreed to, and done.
When you take money, albeit very small, and not noticeable, what's another word for that definition?  Didn't superman movie do that once?  Office space, maybe?
You agree to something you didn't read months before you make a purchase, suddenly TAG!
I won't do it.  Inserting yourself into a private transaction is very banky; despicable.

They enjoy a 1:10 instant profit return from your fiat deposit using fractional reserve banking.  Do you think they will try fractionalize your bitcoin deposit?  Think they will try to disrupt their competitor to free money?  I say - keep you money in your own wallet.  Buy from circle, if you must - but know who they are and what their track record has been.

O.O the moment you realize it's the dollar that fluctuates in value.  Bitcoin is mathematically predictable.
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:08:45
I guess you didn't see the stock market flux 6,000 points last week?  volatility is only a problem for the dollar.  Bitcoin has a steady, known rate of disbursement, where the dollar is at the whim of a private company, called the Federal Reserve.
I hate being in dollar - it's waaaaaay to volatile.
@_date: 2015-08-30 06:01:43
you know, the FX markets... it's all markets and it's all priced in dollars.  The dollar is the reserve currency.
You can take the blue pill and believe whatever you want to believe.  or you can take the red pill, and realize it IS the dollar on a violent flux.
The price flux you see in bitcoin, is not bitcoin - it the dollar value.....

No confusion.  works the same for state and private.  If people stop paying into it - you will not get "your money" back out.  It is the definition of ponzi.  I quote "your money" because if you don't hold it, you don't own it.  If I were young again, I wouldn't put a cent into SS, pensions, or 401K paper schemes.

democracy != freedom
 &amp;&amp; democracy = tyranny by 51%
banks print and own money - so the "rich" are bankers, who payoff the state to keep "democracy" afloat via gun power and taxes.
    while(government){
    We need government for democracy, 
    so the rich won't fuck us, 
    this is what's happening now

Lending might look profitable when you look at a bank.  The KEY difference is banks create money, so they are lending out something that didn't exist before (0 risk).  Whereas when you lend money - you earned it first (huge risk).

The only volatility in the bitcoin price is that of fiat.  Bitcoin value is steady going up at a mathematically predictable rate.  Fiat paper money violently jerks up and down at the will of the money creators.
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:22:17
As long as they can print money, and people think it has value, they will be able to manipulate the bitcoin market at will.  The day is coming. HODL!

I got screwed too... made the huge mistake of buying bitcoin from them, on the night of the change.  18 hours later, got a PC email about the change.  Now they are holding less than $100.00 of bitcoin hostage for 3-4 days.   When I asked them to release my bits immediately, they upped my limits, told me to use my debit card, and buy moar. 
Thanks for the heads up Circle jerks....
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:54:10
They changed the code on their site, then sent an email about it 12 hours later.  Those that had been used to instant coins for up to $100 suddenly have to wait 3 days,  Only if we knew to use a debit card for the same account! WTF Circle?

I don't have to believe when I can calculate it out.  It doesn't matter if the masses see it or not.  The proof is in the math.  Truth is truth if you believe it or not. Lie is a lie if everybody believes it or not.
It's the exact same lie when people say homes go up in value.  No they don't.  It requires more dollars to buy the same house.  It was the dollar that went down in value due to inflation.

I've bought at $..14/25/45/75/200/300/500/800/900... and I'll keep buying.  last I checked - I still have the same amount of bitcoin.  It's the dollar and the fiat currency price that is all over the place.  Bitcoin has is mathematically calculable value.

Let's not forget the feds that kicked dem mo'mo's out of New York, then Illinois, and "banished" them to Utah.  Polygamy is no longer a thing, thanks to the same feds.
Mormons have a lot to gain back if they can shed the Dollar.  They are already Pro-silver, and it's Utah law that you must accept silver as currency when presented.
Of course, bitcoin nullifies all their paper, including the very laws they write, right now.

No.  That's the lie everyone believes.  The truth is it now takes more dollars to buy the same thing.  Did the wood in the house go up in value?  is the grass greener?  Did the kitchen sink increase in value?  So what's the change?  The dollar inflation rate at the whim of bankers.  that's what changed.  More dollars in the market, making them worth less.  Therefore, the house purchased at $200,000 now requires MOAR dollars.
Is the big mac worth more now?  or are there moar dollars competing for the same big mac?
Bitcoin inflates at a predictable rate, then it stops.  Banks will inflate until it's worthless.

100,000 aint shit.  "Globally" to add importance pffft.... Your app isn't generating money for google. Although I agree with the security concerns, it sounds like you had it wrapped up with the auto checks for a new version, different from google play - as any smart developer would do.
My battle is not with you - it's with google favoritism, and it's holier-than-thou levels of concern for different developers.  It's fucking stupid.  One guy gets ban from google for ever for the same simple "mistake", while you get red carpet - thank you lucky stars!
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:22:12

The government can create Treasury bonds, but it cannot print money, without the express request of a private bank, called the Federal Reserve, whom is the last buyer of these Treasury bonds.  So when you pay tax, it goes to pay the bondholder - The Federal Reserve, a private bank.  Let thank sink in.  Your government isn't funded by taxes.  It's funded by the Federal Reserve.

I have a question:
How did you get personal attention from Google?  This is unheard of in the community.  Regular folk get the axe, then only return under a different application name (ie brand new app).  That has been my personal experience after adding a bitcoin / dogecoin donation button to my game, it was bricked, then the appeal was immediately denied.
This all despite my willingness to immediately rectify the problem as you did, and had the same ignorance to the policy as you did.  How the fuck do you rate?
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:45:13
Google is on a rampage!  if you check out - DAILY someone loses their app on the app store - it's completely devastating to the developer.
If you fuck google twice, they will ban you for life - like no gmail - no google wallet - ever ever never ever.   If you try to setup a new account - they know, and will ban that too - forever.
I have been a victim of "whim" in their policy - and this exact one - for accepting tips in the form of doge / bitcoin.  nothing traded, just simple .005 penny tips.
