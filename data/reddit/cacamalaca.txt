In an ideal world, your proposal may be accurate.
In reality, lawmakers and politicians want central/reckless control to inflate the money supply and drown the country in debt in order to fulfill the laundry list of campaign promises that got them elected. Economic accountability is the last thing they desire.
If political powers get a whiff that Bitcoin threatens to become what you suggest, they will (and already are) severe the free inflow of capital into the crypto market; exchanges will be shut down and merchants prohibited from accepting Bitcoin as a payment option.

It should be simple to explain any shift of counterparty risk though? Gdax did not send 5 btc to bitfinex in a single blockchain transaction, that would defeat the whole benefit of the federated sidechain.

The market definitely cares about TX fees. Coinbase has a temporary monopoly on certain services that enable the continuation of operational inefficiencies, but they will lose customers when competitors emerge whom offer lower w/d fees.


Not really. Bitcoin investors value decentralization more than base layer transaction throughput.

AFAIK, Coinbase is the only US-facing company that offers instant credit/debit card deposits. CB also has the most noob-friendly interface, easy bank account linkage, and afaik allows for small purchases without KYC. Also, free transfers to GDAX to trade alts.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:32:35
Miner collusion to artificially increase congestion and break fee estimators is a legitimate argument to be had, but it's absurd to label the incompetent technical operations of Coinbase as a malicious spam attack. The market will, in time, flush out companies whom partake in such practices.

Quick question. 
My understanding is that in order to move coins to the Liquid sidechain, the user must first send coins to a federated business, then receives an equal number of coins on the sidechain. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume that business is a popular cryptocurrency change. How does the 1:1 peg survive if that particular exchange gets hacked and loses all its Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:33:14
Is there an ELI5 somewhere?
The Bitcoins must be held in reserve *somewhere.* Let's say Alice deposits 5 BTC to GDAX and sends it to Bitfinex via Liquid. The 5 BTC deposited to GDAX remain with GDAX on the blockchain, but 5 BTC on Liquid are sent to Bitfinex. Then GDAX gets hacked and loses all its BTC. What happens when Alice tries to convert her Liquid BTC from Bitfinex to BTC? How is the peg maintained?

The penalties are softer for non-willful noncompliance than willful. But I seriously doubt the IRS will consider anyone non-willfully out of compliance at this point, because anyone who made &gt;$20k would need a very compelling argument for why they haven't amended returns for the previous years.
Most likely, the IRS will mainly focus on people who they suspect substantially under-reported or didn't file at all.

Public stupidity is responsible for electing representatives who legislate a tax code that benefits multinational corporations and the wealthiest individuals and households. My 1 diluted vote is the extent to which I can help resolve that particular problem.
I don't think "regular people rounding up their modest salaries" is who the IRS is targeting here. The IRS charges modest penalties and interest that won't amount to much money in the case of small gains. They specifically asked for accounts that held at least a $20k balance, hardly a rounding error.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:49:54
The IRS doesn't need to prove what happen. It's the defendant who must prove the source of funds.
We'll see. I think the most likely scenario is the IRS has a honeypot of noncompliant individuals that fit your first sentence that they won't waste resources on people in compliance.
You're not wrong about people who avoided taxes through cash and DEX. However, they're taking bigger risk, by selling Bitcoin for cash without a license or following legal procedure (i think you have to KYC your purchaser for cash amounts exceeding a certain figure).

No idea where your data is from. I see a 0.4% difference between the Visa exchange rate and market exchange rate for the US/EU pair. 
I don't see how "this" is a game changer at all. Fraud protection and dispute resolutions is a reason to use a credit card instead of BTC, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:20:25
At some point you need to buy the BTC in order to use it. The lowest taker fee is 0.25% on most US exchanges with fiat onramps, in addition to the cost of the chosen deposit method. 
That said, to convert currency for only 0.5% fee is an excellent exchange rate relative to internal bank rates for wire transfers. Bitcoin already competes with legacy options for large cross-border payments such as property purchases abroad or remittances. However, Bitcoin is ages away from competing with Visa for consumer purchases. That's a totally different ballgame. Bitcoin needs fully functional second layer solutions for any hope to capture marketshare, and even then it's an extremely uphill battle. 
The base layer, which is all we have at the moment, isn't built for consumer transactions

@_date: 2018-08-26 19:41:06


Actually, it did. Remember the BCH/Segwit2x hijack attempt? It failed because BTC maintained value and miners were unwilling mine BCH at a less profitable RoI.
Miners operate on thin margins with profits dependent of the market value of BTC. The fact that mining hardware is so specialized aligns the interest of miners and the market, because if $BTC tanks, the hardware becomes worthless space heaters.

Bitcoin is the best peer to peer value transfer system in the world. As cited above, volatility is decreasing, and when it's stable, there will be no arguments left to be made against it.
I work in online gaming where cross border payments are made in large sums on a daily basis. Swift and ach are slow, expensive, reversible, and require third party intermediaries that constantly fuck with our shit. It's not even close. Our entire industry has transitioned.

We're talking about credit card exchange rates because the debate here about whether it's cheaper for tourists to buy starbucks products with a CC or Bitcoin.
The [CC exchange rates are explained here]( and are virtually = to market rate.
Also you're talking about two different things in your post. There are credit card exchange rates for consumer transaction such as using your Visa card for coffee at starbucks, and exchanging currency at exchange stores or banks. Visa offers very competitive rates, the latter two do not.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:15:06
Retailers currently pay 3% fees on credit card sales. I think Bitpay charges 1%? 
Nevertheless, there is little incentive for consumers to make payments with bitcoin instead of a credit card. The only exceptions are purchases for gray market or illegal products, but other currencies have better fungibility than Bitcoin for such transactions.
This is why Btrash is such a joke. It literally has no use-case whatsoever.
IMO, Bitcoin has a competitive advantage in the area of cross-border money transfers because it avoids banks' currency conversion fees, which from personal experience can amount to up to 8% above market rate.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:51:04
\- Bitcoin volatility has consistently decreased over time and will continue to do so until an equilibrium price is reached. This is not a long-term concern.

Tourists have credit cards that waive foreign transaction fees and in general offer 1% cash back. Figure that the cost of acquiring Bitcoin is a flat \~$10 deposit fee to an exchange and .25% trade fee (or way higher if purchased through Coinbase), how much savings can a tourist expect thats worth sacrificing the convenience offered by credit cards? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:09:17










I'll focus here since this seems to be the crux of your argument.
First, it's important to note that Bitcoin already experienced years long bear markets as you described and people voiced the same exact fears, yet *hashpower increased the entire time.* Also important to note that *average Bitcoin volatility has decreased over time*, so the scenario you describe is becoming less likely to occur. 
We actually don't know the breakeven cost of mining. The few reliable sources that have provided estimates say that operations can stay profitable well below $1k.
Roger Ver and Jihan spent $10mln's worth of massive transaction spam and years of propaganda efforts to come as close as they did in late 2017. Bitcoin market participation and network effect grows by the day and with it the cost to attack the network. At some point in the not to distant future, government backed funding will be needed to pull off the scenario you described.
Anyway, I don't fully understand what you mean by a "catastrophic break of trust." The alignment of economic incentives should ensure this never happens. Bitcoin is essentially backed by the economic incentives to ensure that miners secure the network, because security is Bitcoin's ultimate advantage over other cryptocurrencies. If the incentives inherent to the protocol are not aligned, then Bitcoin is a failed experiment. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:59:33
As  mentioned in OP, most credit cards waive foreign transaction fees.

True, but the ATM makes some sense.
Czech isn't on the euro, and the Kc (judging by the chart) appears quite volatile. I don't know the fees associated with the ATM compared to the cost of acquiring Bitcoin through a european crypto exchange. After accounting for currency conversion fees it's possible the rates are competitive.

The alignment of economic incentives between miners and the market is inherent to Bitcoin. It is by design that everyone is supposed to act in their self-interests. If the incentive equilibrium is broken, decentralization won't save Bitcoin, because miners everywhere will simply... stop mining.
I agree, time will tell many things. My concern is that the hijack attempt proved that the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm is vulnerable to exploitation by a hostile actor with deep pockets. BCH, and UASF for that matter, provided a roadmap for the next attackers.

I've heard from a few people that Houbi and OKC have abysmal KYC protocols. BTCC is known to have strict KYC, so the math adds up that they were excluded from the suspension.
I don't see why mandating exchanges to enforce strict KYC and AML protocols is an unreasonable demand by the PBoC. Tax evasion and money laundering are legitimate concerns in the Bitcoin space.

Let me know if I understand this correctly. Bitcoin makes it easier for individuals to get their money out of CNY. However, because someone on the exchange must take the other side of the trade, Bitcoin purchases made on an exchange do not result in a net outflow of CNY.
Theoretically, if BTC is or becomes used extensively for capital outflow, shouldn't the CNY/USD premium trade at a price equal to what it costs agents to move money in/out of China?
If the above is true, what does shutting down mainland exchanges even accomplish?

It's not the duty of Core contributors to address political issues. In fact, Core taking political stances would give its critics legitimate claims that Core is a centralized entity which goes against the spirit of Bitcoin. 
Core is an open source project whose task is to develop technology that they believe is best for Bitcoin and let the network decide whether to use it. If Core could force adoption, we would already have Segwit. 
The group that feels blocked out is welcome to introduce alternative clients and let the network decide whether to adopt it, or they can fork off. Bitcoin Unlimited has been soundly rejected by the economic majority and faces heavy resistance among miners.

How can you say the "default" choice is less popular? Pretty much all the big exchanges and merchants not only outright rejected the BU roadmap, but also support Segwit. The message couldn't be more clear. 
The only players not onboard with segwit are a few miners who thanks to cheap manufacturing and electricity supply have gotten a dangerous amount of influence over the network and are using it to make a power-grab. 
"The argument is called "the block size debate". The argument is not about the block size. What is being debated is the power over Bitcoin's future. How it can be changed and who decides this kind of changes. In short, this "debate" is about power. And this is not just any power, this is the power over money. Which gives you the ultimate power. Anyone that wants that power is not to be trusted. The Classic / BU clients are advocating giving the power to the miners. The small blockers refuse - to let go of the power."

I agree with you that Jihan's influence may be somewhat overestimated. 
However, it seems most major exchanges, service providers, wallets, etc, are supportive of Segwit.


Meh, I don't fully consider BTCC to be "Chinese" since their CEO and COO are American/Canadian. Or maybe Jihan just has less leverage over the bigger operators. Also, we already know from reputable sources that Jihan is strongarming smaller pools to signal BU: 
What more evidence do you need than a miner saying publicly that Jihan will not provide them Asics if they do not signal BU? 
F2pool "rejected" segwit in a cryptic tweet, then said "BU's code sucks" and called core developers "douchebags." Not exactly a vote of confidence in my books.


Source? Or by community do you mean hashpower?


He's wrong about the aim of BU / emergent consensus being  giving power to the miners?
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:10:41
China, at the time, was falsely presumed to be the market leader, because they lead in trade volume by a massive amount. However, it was mostly fake volume to to zero fee trading. Anyway, point is, the perception was that Bitcoin was about to lose 90% of its trade volume.. so it felt like a big deal.
A contentious hard fork is a much bigger deal. Will it kill Bitcoin? Maybe. But Bitcoin will certainly suffer for a long time.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:09:32
If the goal is compromise, yes. 
I don't know whether the BU miners are open to compromise though. Ver has gone completely radical, no way anyone absent of the second coming of Satoshi could change his anti-core agenda.
If Jihan can be reasoned with, then compromise is possible. He did sign the HK agreement which provides some hope. Adam Back supports Segwit + bigger blocks. With a neutral representative like Vinny and the backing of prominent Core devs, maybe something can be worked out.

I'm confused because the RSK homepage says:
Instant Payments
"Since the creation of Bitcoin there has been a race for faster transaction confirmations. Instant payments allow new use cases, such as retail store payments, and transactions in online games. RSK carefully chosen parameters and new theoretical protocols (such as DECOR+GHOST) allow creating blocks at 10 seconds average interval, with low stale block rate, and no additional centralization incentives."

After seeing Bitcoin survive the Bitfinex hack earlier this year, it must require a security breach of epic proportions for hackers to kill the market. All the more reason for an ETF, imo. Anyway, I think the bigger risk is china/usa/eu governments cracking down on the major exchanges, although I think only China poses an existential threat and the market can persevere without the West.
I am often surprised by how little discussion takes place about whether China's government has sufficient incentive to continue allowing capital outflow to Bitcoin. China recently placed limits on ATM withdrawals in Macau presumably to crack down on outflow. If Bitcoin market cap continues to grow, while China hosts &gt;90% of exchange volume and &gt;75% of mining transactions, it could spell disaster.

Hi Luke,
Thanks for the response. I understand the primary intention of Segwit is not to provide immediate congestion relief, but rather to pave the way for second layer solutions such as lightning network. 
I am just trying to get a better understanding of how spam actually works and whether a block size increase would reduce spam. One poster mentioned that at present a group of miners could split the cost to spam the network to collect higher fees. If hashpower remains proportional (or worse, some miners gain hashpower share) after a block size increase, why would that make miners less likely to spam the network? 
I am missing part of the puzzle. Most mining pool operators benefit from high fees, because most pools keep fees and distribute block rewards. Why would they want something that reduces fees?

Until today, I never read much about financial laws and how international transactions are routed &amp; processed. I am trying to learn as much as possible, because I think this can become a big deal &amp; impact the industry.
I figure(d) banks would become more likely to block transfers from Bitcoin exchanges if legal precedent is established, even if it is not necessary, because they will have a much easier case to win against Bitcoin exchanges in potential lawsuits that may arise.
Anyway, this post is quite interesting: 
The rules might be somewhat different in this case, since WF is a correspondent bank with a reciprocal banking relationship with the Taiwan bank in question.

Hopefully SF is crypto friendly
Is there any case law about the legality of a correspondent bank with a reciprocal banking relationship blocking service to one of the bank's clients without reason?
When I first read the article, I thought the case would not see the light of day in a courtroom- US banks have well established precedent to deny service without reason to companies and individuals. If I understand you correctly, the argument Bitfinex can make is that WF, as a correspondent bank, is in violation of a contract with the taiwan bank in question. If it's breach of contract instead of "WF is hurting out business," surely that is likely to go to court? What arguments can WF make in their defense?

I suppose that would depend on what fits your definition of a "fine" currency.
I agree that Bitcoin is not good for responsibly managed consumption driven economies. Unfortunately, most of the global population does not live in the luxury of those conditions, and likely never will. They need a currency that above all else will retain value and not self-implode under reckless monetary policy by central authorities.

Not really. A small group of people on a subreddit are saying this, but the majority of folks who invested in Bitcoin probably don't know what's going on. Hell, there are people in this subreddit who don't understand what is going on. 
You really think, outside the extremists on this Subreddit, the majority of users support UASF instead of Segwit2MB? Maybe you ought to actually talk to your average Bitcoin user who isn't even smart enough not to keep coins on a web wallet or exchange. Ask if they want to see the price crash in order to scale or accept a reasonable compromise.

Aren't the transactions posted to the blockchain as an unconfirmed transaction, so we would see if the ransoms payments were sent and waiting to be mined?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:52:28
Yup can't wait watch my wealth nosedive because you extremist are unwilling to compromise. Its cute when you say this is what users want, fucking delusional to think people want to watch their wealth evaporated. Lots of innocent people who actually use bitcoin as a currency will get hurt.

The expectation is that 80% of hashpower / mining nodes will to switch to BTC1 very soon, right? Can we expect a smooth transition until the hard fork in November, or are they likely to fuck up at some point like BU with its regular 60-80% nodes going offline to 0days.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:59:11
The UASF movement has made me realize that the "Core" community is just as toxic as the big blockers.
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:18:26
Understood, thanks.
I am trying to evaluate the short-term network risks of BTC1, which is difficult because I lack the technical knowledge to assess the code, and very little about it is published. The hard fork is obviously a clusterfuck being rushed and poorly tested. However is it probable that BTC1 can safely execute the Segwit lock-in and activation? If not, what are the implications? These are the questions I am struggling to find answered :(

Plenty of people successfully flee the USA. Snowden seems to be doing alright... so long as he doesn't take a vacation to a fucking country that is a close ALLY of the USA.

Agree. Why wasn't this addressed? It's what I am personally most scared of. 
The miners have already comitted to attacking the minority chain
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:57:23


I think many would appreciate your opinion about the short-term impact on network security that will soon happen if/when the mining supermajority adopts BTC1 (or don't mine with BTC1 but signal Bit4 somehow). 
Although the technical community is ubiquitous in its concerns about the November 2x hard fork, not much has been said about code changes that could impact stability throughout the intermittent period up-to and between the segwit lock-in period, segwit activation, and the hard fork.

I thought miners will be running BTC1?

They laundered us dollars to us citizens through us financial services. Obviously the us has no legal authority to prosecute anyone who commits such crimes. Besides, btc-e was not money laundering anyway, because they were also laundering money into other countries too, like the mafia and things.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:21:49
Thanks again.
I remember the days of early BU deployment when 60-80% of the nodes had a few instances of random crashes. The Core devs faulted this on rushed production, poor testing and lack of peer review. 
Now Core devs are saying the same thing about BTC1. The difference being that BTC1, unlike BU, will be live on 80% of the mining nodes. Is the network at heightened risk on a day-to-day basis from random events such as what happened with BU nodes? What are some things that can happen?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:33:19
Assuming Segwit lock-in and activation goes smoothly, are miners obligated under the NYA, or do you expect them, to continue mining with BTC1? If so, would that make Garzik and his skeletal crew the defacto developers/maintainers of the Bitcoin mining network? I admit I do not fully understand the complexity of this, but such a scenario sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, even pre-HF.

This did seem to coincide with the mempool clearing up. I imagine darknets like to tumble deposits &amp; withdrawals many times over. Obviously have no data to back this up and am most likely wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:12:36
And that miners will abandon Core software for poorly tested and rushed code.
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:05:53


Could you please ELI5?
I'm curious whether miners will actually use, or be required to use, BTC1 software to signal Bit4. If they do, what are the risks? I recall reading speculation that Antpool was somehow signaling BU but mining with Core. I don't see much basic explanations for these types of technical occurrences, so it's difficult to gain an understanding and piece together how everything works.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:56:50
Don't need to run BTC1 to signal NYA.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:16:00
The demands from the public would be to ban bitcoin. They don't understand what an address is

You think altcoins are properly valued?
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:06:24
I've been wondering if July 21-23, aka the dates of btc1 deployment and segwit lock-in, poses potential network security risks. I've not seen the question asked nor answered much. All miners switching clients to btc1 within a fee days time, is something likely to go wrong?
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:45:35
Yeah, I hadn't yet my morning coffee before making that post.

When the market matures, yes. 
People who say there can never be a use-case for Bitcoin must have never dealt with foreign exchange fees. 
For now, Bitcoin ATM's and localbitcoins are just as bad as XE fees. Unless you can find someone to sell Bitcoin for cash at the foreign exchange rate, there is not much of an advantage. 
The professional gambling community is a microcosm of the demand for a mature borderless currency. If you go to Vegas, especially now during the world series of poker, players are paying a premium to BUY bitcoin in order to circumvent foreign exchange fees (and general banking issues) when they travel abroad.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:58:51
Yes, but shit economies like Venezuela with median income of ~~$5/hr~~ dogshit won't have much impact on current price level. The vast majority of its citizens live in poverty and spend what they make on food and shelter, and the moneyed class has access to foreign markets which are more stable than Bitcoin. At best, it will *slightly* increase Bitcoin adoption and non-speculative floor value.

Welcome to the world of being American without a "normal" source of income. Us expats have been struggling with constant bullshit like this for years, which explains why renunciations are increasing at a rapid rate, with 4000 US citizens renounced last year alone. Congress response? It's worth losing citizens, and making life miserable for Americans abroad, to catch tax evaders.

"She's not alone. According to the US Treasury, a record 4,279 individuals renounced their US citizenship or long-term residency in 2015 - an increase of 20% on the previous year, which was itself a record-breaking year.
In 2010, just 1,006 gave up being US citizens, but since then the numbers have risen every year."
FATCA passed in 2010. It will only get worse. Also, FATCA has absolutely nothing to do with gambling. I don't know what you're on about.

Great idea. Core should engage in politics instead of its exclusive focus on the technical elements of bitcoin. Maybe a super pac is in order too

Why would Joe Sickpack use Bitcoin instead of his credit card for a $50 transaction? It's just as much as, if not a bigger, hassle to convert Bitcoin to fiat than wait 3 weeks for a check. The Bitcoin market/industry has not yet matured to where it can compete with fiat for that purpose. If that changes, so will Joe Sixpack's preference in gambling sites imo.

True, but Bovada is still a legacy gaming site. It deals primarily with fiat and incurs massive overhead costs of effectively laundering money for USA withdrawals. They also have virtually no  serious competition in the USA market except for 5dimes. 
However, what we did see, was the massive investment made by Bovada to push its users to Bitcoin. Bovada ran excellent Bitcoin-specific deposit/reload bonuses for most of last year. I can only imagine the amount of money they lose to credit card chargebacks... Bitcoin must be a godsend.
