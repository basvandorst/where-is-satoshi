The US only has two civilized levers to pull to pay obligations. Raise taxes or print money. Bitcoin solves inflation, taxes are still a challenge. I vote modern money theory and buy bitcoin.

The exchange rates are available with the basic login. You can also get the rates using the API without logging in. We included a method to contact on the Free API so we can contact you if there is an issue or changes to the API.
There are no fees, and the user experience is very cool.
