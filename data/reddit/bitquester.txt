Agreed.  There was a growing momentum in May, but the discourse over block size has really reminded everyone how small/fragile the network is.  I'm certain there have been a handful of people with deep pockets who have recently said, "Wait, this entire thing could be put in jeopardy by a couple of guys who live with their parents?"
Of course, none of these guys live with their parents, but the mindset of big money guys is either they are for innovation and progress, or they are whiny and difficult.  This debate over blocksize has shown how difficult it is going to be to make bitcoin live up to its potential.

Agreed.  It's strange, but hey.

Block just found - 926kb and still leaves 3500 unconfirmed.

Hmmm...this is true - it makes it "great" for those people who think these things are great.  But to an outside investor (who either wants to buy lots of coin or fund bitcoin companies), their only question is "will this scale"?  If they see that there is constant risk of forks and network weakness due to necessity of consensus among disparate parties, they will say "maybe not" or at least "let's see how this plays out first."  To outsiders (and even big BTC-holders like myself), there's way too much ambiguity re: how consensus plays out.  It seems on target for a hard fork with eleventh-hour implementation.  That's a lot of uncertainty.

You can tell he means well, but he's just young.  The worst were/are his earnings release stories.  I've literally never seen someone write Wall Street in a more absurd and incomprehensible manner.  God bless him, but he's just trying too hard perhaps.  Needs to go out and join a startup and put in some hours.

Just makes confirmation times much much longer, and therefore makes bitcoin less likely to gain further adoption as it tries to scale

Yeah I suspect there are a few others as well who are waiting for confirmation of an uptrend.  It moved from 260-305 pretty quickly.  We may see something similar soon.

Nice.  Eventually I'm hoping there are enough accumulators like us that supply shrinks up a bit.  Seems like those 3600 coins a day still weigh pretty heavy.

There are a lot more bitcoins out there to trade now, and a much more developed OTC market.  As such, the chance that it goes from 235 to 1000 in a month are slightly lower, primarily because there are more holders who likely have pre-planned sell prices.  
Beyond this, there are many more people who have a vested interest in making sure that BTC price has lower volatility going forward.  If it goes up and down 50%, it's less viable for many business lines.  
All this said, I'm certainly buying more here.  It doesn't appear as though there's much selling pressure here and there has been steady buying despite lower overall buying and it becoming slightly more difficult to buy BTC at scale given heightened regulations.
