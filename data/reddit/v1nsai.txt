So let me break it down the way I understand it, and if I'm wrong hopefully someone will come school both of us.
I'm pretty sure the only thing that the government can really worry about is transactions involving USD (barring buying illegal shit with crypto money or something), so basically you only pay taxes when you cash out.  When you cash out you have to pay capital gains taxes, which Coinbase has alerted me with a bigass banner at the top of their page that they will be providing me a form.  I intend to plug that form into HR Block's easy online tax returns system (that did me very right last year after TurboTax tried to screw me) and plug in whatever I need to from that form.
Since we're in the """""""land of the free""""""" we basically only have one choice for spending USD on crypto, so just get that form from Coinbase and give it to your tax guy or make sure you enter it online.
It's been my experience that when money is involved people and organizations are very good about reminding you how to pay them, so if there's anything else the IRS can let me know or eat me.  Maybe not the smartest way to be about it but this shit pisses me off too so this is the amount of effort I'm willing to exert.

I'm not worried about stalking anyone in particular, more interested in how people use bitcoin (trying to make the case that its not JUST silk road and alphabay and whatnot)

Yea saw them, I was met with an immediate NOPE when I mentioned that I had found a site that looks great but would cost money.
Is it really that expensive or were you just throwing out a random number?
