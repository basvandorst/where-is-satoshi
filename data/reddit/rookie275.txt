I do have the back up seed. I can't even see the transactions. Can someone steal my bitcoins and even delete the transactions on my Ledger blue?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:36:34
how do I update the firmware on the ledger blue?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:38:46
I checked. There are no updates for the blue at this time per the device
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:39:17
Yes I bought it from ledger. There are no current updates per device. It is current.

Ok thanks

I won’t be surprised if this drops to 5000 or below.....
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:53:43
I’m looking at my portfolio...if I look at the Jan peak it now looks like it’s showing me the middle finger.....it’s telling me that it fucked me. Feels about right 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:03:05
Either way...we going to hit 5000 or lower soon
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:47:37
6500 before the weekend end. 5000 by next week. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:17:03
Below 5000 not out of the question at this point...couple of more big dumps and were there
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:57:22
Time to retest earlier lows and clear out the weak hands. Needs to go below previous low and induce panic selling. Wouldn’t be surprised to see 3000
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:53:56
Buy the Dip. Getting tired of this shit. But the dip so smart people can sell....yes buy the fucking dip
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:01:01
6500 in 24 hrs? Anyone Anyone?
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:38:13
Printing Tether to buy BTC and raise its price. No more printing, no more buying and shit keep spiraling down. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:59:44
Looks like about to break 7000, then 6000, then the panic selling sets in...then 5000 or below. 
For all the hodlers...why not sell now and buy back below 6000?
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:36:46
I need to be put in a fucking coma until this things recovers
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:07:33
Everyone is waiting for the BTC halving run. Imagine if it’s already priced in. There will be a lot of unhappy people.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:19:56
Flip a fucking coin....and now u can predict what bitcoin will do. 
Fucking g serving the elites. Bitcoin is a mirage. 
It’s fuck u little guy again money.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:18:13
No one knows shit
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:51:39
20 trillion market cap, 
BTC will be 25000
no wait 40000
There’s not enough BTC for every millionaire to own one. 
Crypto doesn’t correlate with equity
Big money is going to start pouring in. 
U get the point. All bullshit propaganda. We’re going to 5000 and below.....
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:58:38
Institutional money....I got sucked into with that bullshit excuse....institutional money cane and raped everyone and left in January 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:50:30
Well if this the rate of drop we maybe at 5000 today lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:15:32
I give up....good luck to everyone.

@_date: 2018-03-15 02:38:33

@_date: 2018-07-12 20:22:52

@_date: 2018-07-21 19:37:02
Oops auto correct. Meant friend
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:15:43
What a fucking shit show this is. Why don’t these idiots just work together...all these bitcoin side chains. Market cap down from 700 billion to under 100 billion and they are fighting among themselves.
