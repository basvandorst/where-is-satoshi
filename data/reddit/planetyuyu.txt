When I create this reddit support contact me, scale  my case to Card Issue team and request me (again) a selfie  with my ID. After 24 hours I don't have anwsers and my Debit Card stay blocked.
I really don't know whats up with XAPO and their services, since past year they request me my ID many times and block my debit card, if not enough with one or two times?
I have plastic and virtual debit cards with cryptopay.me and spectrocoin.com and I never had problems with this services, XAPO is the only one that permanently block my debit card.
Soon news about this case...

I'm a active user of blockchain, fortnight ago I make a investment in HASHPRIME when I see theyr anounce in your site exactly in the Blockchain Partners box, I trust in HASHPRIME because I see the anounce in Blockchain site. I invest only US$25 and recover $3 but today I have the great supprise, HASHPRIME is down and banned as dangerous site I lost US$22 but the most disappointing blockchain recomend me invest in a scammer site. I don't feel safe with blockchain after this situation, please need an answer on this and my US$22

As we suspected all HASHPRIME seems to be a scam, today the site is offline and banned as unsafe site, I just lost $ 22 was not much but thought investing $ 1,000 I think I've saved.
