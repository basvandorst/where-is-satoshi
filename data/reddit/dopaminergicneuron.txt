Guys, there is a thread very similar to this [here]( and I think both posters are the same person. The very similar topics make it look strange, especially because nobody can really explain what the problem might be. It might be a weak hint, but instead of "there" they both use "their" ("[...] is their anything I can do?" over in the other thread and "copy and paste email saying theirs nothing they can do" over here). But I'm not a detective, just my thoughts.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and am sorry if that really happened to you, but looking at both posts it just seems like FUD.

You are right, I corrected the link.

Exactly, seems suspicious. My thoughts on this [here](

Guys, it has been said before in the very similar thread to be found [here]( but this is probably just someone trying to sow uncertainty. The very similar topics make it even stranger, and I think both are the same guy. It might be a weak hint, but instead of "there" they both use "their" ("[...] is their anything I can do?" here and "copy and paste email saying theirs nothing they can do" over in the other thread). But I'm not a detective, just my thoughts.

Yes perhaps. I may have worded my post a bit too strongly, if this really happened to you I am sorry for you. But in light of recent events it should be noted that my theory might as well be right.
