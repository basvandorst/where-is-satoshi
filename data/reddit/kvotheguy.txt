This is horrible advice. Spend the bitcoin, then buy more! Help with adoption. If no one uses it, it loses a lot of its intrinsic value

Maybe in another article!

They can accept pure btc payments... We need a POS for actual lightning payments.

I think there is some truth here for sure. The farther down it goes the more sure I am that I need to hodl.

Nice visual!

What the hell

Not decentralized... Not open source..

Depends on you wallet. Most wallets have a slider or a manual entry option when you go to send a payment. Google the method for your specific wallet if you can't figure it out.

Nice editing skills

Awesome thanks!

Teach newcomers don't belittle them. Damn.

Hmm maybe I'm just thick. It's funny but seems the opposite...

I check to see the backlog of unconfirmed transactions and set my fee based on that.

Thanks! Seems like it could work, though admittedly I'm not super familiar. If you are interested, I just added a "Bitcoin" folder in the repo for additional "coin-specific" requirements. Submit a PR!

Take a look at this alias protocol:

Should we be talking about Bitmain controlling over 50&amp; of the network as Vitalik says? How do we push back?
@_date: 2018-07-14 23:36:21
Nice, glad it's working out!
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:47:17
You need a mobile wallet!

It's still cause of concern. We shouldn't be letting the mempool fill. I still believe in 2 mb block increase. There is no logical argument against it. Commodity hardware can handle that.
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:47:10
I get that, but that is a lot of work. Most people paying in a coffeeshop won't be doing that
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:10:19
Isn't there some confidence to be had that the transaction is sitting on many nodes in the mempool, waiting to be added? I'm not saying it is very secure I'm just asking how much confidence can be stated? Surely it is greater than 0 right?

Thanks for the feedback. 
1. If you take a look at the github repo there is an issues regarding the format. If you would like to, could you take a look and give you're input. I would like to gather several ideas then do a public poll. (Because alias format at the end of the day just needs to look nice and allow good username formats)
2. Unless I don't understand, you are suggesting that user's upload their wallet seeds to the server? I don't like that because that gives the server control over the users funds. I anticipate that the majority of these CCAP servers will be centralized third parties like in SMTP. Obviously the protocol allows for private servers as well but I don't think we should compromise private keys.
3. I am currently working on a CCAP server, I would like to add a section to the document titled "Best practices" that isn't necesarily baked into the protocol, but anyone running a server can use them as a guide for security and privacy.
4. CCAP is supposed to be the bare-bones for all cryptos. I want to start building out coin specific additional protocols. In the github repo we just need an additional folder per coin with its own README.md 
If you are interested in contributing, please make a PR for coin-specific additional protocols.

I agree, I guess it comes down to what hardware is "good enough" (some people can only run raspberry pi, but that is out of the question)
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:35:27
I don't sell. You HODL.

Really? All my Bitcoin net worth is in BTC. I think Bitcoin Cash will lose in the end because if they were right then BTC will just increase the blocksize because it is really easy to do.

Great read man. Thanks
