You do accept blips because you are absolutely certain that someone else in society will at some point require blips to pay their taxes. Noone will ever require BTC

You still haven't pointed out anything about Microsoft to show that it is overpriced. I assume you are dodging the question because you don't actually have any specific information on it. edit: I also suspect you don't realize that different share prices represent different size slices of different size pies and aren't directly comparable.
What exactly is wrong with stock buybacks? How exactly is the fed related to stock prices and why would low rates cause overpricing? what IS over pricing?

Overpriced or fairly priced? What is the fair price in your oppinion for ownership of Microsoft and why has no one else realized what you have?

So tell me what’s the obvious fair price of Microsoft or at the very least what obvious factors the market is missing

You mean speculating

No it isn’t. Speculating is purely price based hoping to earn money based off a change in price and often with no care as to the actual underlying value. It’s speculation that the price will move favorably to your interest. This is fundamentally different from investing by purchasing an actual cash flow such as in a bond or dividend paying stock

and price changes till that equilibrium is established

Stocks are securities which entitle the holder to a cash flow. Bitcoin is much more like a commodity much like usdollars. The difference is usdollars have guaranteed demand since taxes need to be paid in usdollars
