@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:24
Trust me id love to not pay taxes but is it worth the hassle to try and avoid it when its inevitable... fuck most these people are in BTC to make a profit and do nothing to make that profit so why not pay a tax for your free money 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:06:28
I wouldnt risk it , why cheap out on the device youre going to protect all your bitcoin on? Its like being rich and buying a used wallet with a hole and all your money falls out ....... just saying lol

Its 100 dollars usd with shipping and all . Took about a couple weeks. I wouldn't recommend buying one from an outside source that would be able to hack into it after selling it to you... buy from the website . Most secure

Nobody knows dude, nobody can predict the future 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:26:27
Yeahh it says the issue is resolved but theyre investigating the issue now , its still in yellow saying degraded performance   
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:09
Im praying on a huge dip 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:09:41
Also been buying some LTC in the meantime and bought half a coin lastnight at 170 since it had a nice climb yesterday and now today its back to 140! Oh i love cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:25
Just cash out there 2k or tell them to wait a little and you'll pay them 2.5k or 3k if you let them leave the money in which in turn will still make you more money

If its like coinbase once you buy at a certain price it locks in that price no matter how long it takes to receive it
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:54:18
Wasnt it just a rick roll? Did i not watch the right video? Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:58:19
Isnt that what a hardware wallet is..... an offline storage 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:08:19
I literally researched for a month and never posted onto reddit for answeres... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:37
Gosh can we upvote this to the top to get these nubez out of here hahhaha
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:48:02
No its like a bank account in a sense but if you leave in on an exchange you leave the risk of hackers so you get a hardware wallet and send your coins to the wallet thats not connected to internet until you plug it in so nobody can hack it

Hesitation is the death of you in Bitcoin, I hesitated at 7.1 but snagged at 7.9
