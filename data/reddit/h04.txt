I doubt it. I made the wallet so early and had no idea about the recovery phrase. These days there’s a pop up and warnings that we should get it and write it down. Back then you had to go to settings and find it out yourself. I’ll try asking them. I made it on a different computer but used it extensively on a 2nd one I still have access to. Any idea if I’d need my old one and if it’s still possible if it got reformatted?

I doubt everyone just decided to buy within an hour today. Something else is going on, these are big purchases.

Mine is at $10k right now. Long story short, my password randomly changed is all I can think of. I used the same password for months and one day it just didn't work. I didn't know about the 12 word phrase as it wasn't something blockchain told us we should get and write down yet. 
I didn't drink for several months prior and after "forgetting" my password. No drugs either. I have no idea what happened, I'm completely to blame but I didn't lose my faith in bitcoin even after that.

Where can I find that? If you mean resending the wallet ID to my email, then yeah I've tried that. Although the wallet ID hasn't changed since around late 2014, including in the new emails, I have records of that. Unless they've been emailing me the wrong wallet ID as well.

They normally have issues or high fees when receiving on Paypal. I think it was around 4-6% last someone told me. Quite a few of them do online gold farming on games. So when receiving payment, they choose bitcoin. Doing this earns them more than they could make in Venezuela. I've seen a kid get his whole family playing a game to make money to sell for cash.

My paypal account randomly got closed and despite several attempts at asking why, they never gave me a reason aside from the automated email that basically says because we can.
Edit: They also closed a friend’s account that was almost a decade old for the same reason. We guessed it was because we got paid by the same company.

Did a quick search and found gdax, which sounded familiar because it's on this subrreddit's top post as I post it as having one of the highest trading volumes.
Best to look into it yourself and do some digging into its legitimacy, they claim to be tied to coinbase.

Sounds really convenient and one of the many things that bitcoin is strong in. Bitcoin is amazing in the Philippines, being able to top up your account from 7/11 sounds unbelievable but possible here. Congratulations on the marriage.

Sounds like on top of the 2% fee they say theres a 5% conversion fee not mentioned.
@_date: 2017-01-04 05:18:28
How's rebit? I find coins.ph extremely convenient and hard to beat. Also for load you get a 5% rebate. ATM cardless withdrawal is a godsend, no need to wait at  remittance centers. Just input the receiver's number and give them the code they email you, and they can pick up the funds through ANY security bank ATM machine. 0 fees. Instant.

Can you explain why that happens if the poster is telling the truth? Maybe bitso's rates are just higher for both buying and selling?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:39:46
It hasnt gone below the price of december yet. Even at the peek of december's price compared to january's low. January just started however.

Bitcoin is way too small and rarely used in the Philippines for this store to benefit from it. This is coming from someone who encourages it, holds a few coins, and loves coinsph's services (which isnt really for its btc).
@_date: 2017-01-04 09:14:18
Seems like bitcoin is just trading at a higher price on bitso by 5-10% atm.

Gold is used for many things. Store of wealth, electronics, jewellery, medals and trophies to name some. Gold has been used for thousands of years and has stood the test of time. While I’m a huge supporter of bitcoin, I can’t believe you’re argument is btc would only be x2.5 the value of a metal that has been desired and used for thousands of years without much of a global impact.
Redditor for a week explains it I guess.

There is no way achieving 250k is more feasible and likely than it going from $100 to 20k. While I’ve held until 20k and still believe there is way more potential than that, I’m not going to use the argument oh Bitcoin went from 1-10k pretty easily. By that logic it can multiply another thousand times much easier right? No.
You’d need a global economy collapse and panic for that to happen, the dollar value would have to drop significantly. Right now there are around 10 trillion dollars in circulation, the most used currency in the world by far. You’re saying that all the bitcoin in circulation could he worth about half of all the dollars in circulation. A currency that is heavily backed by the most powerful country in the world.
While it’s possible to hit that number, there’s no way in hell it’s more likely than going from 100-20k. You’re talking about global adoption for that to happen and we are nowhere near that. For 100-20k you just needed to give people a reason to use it. For 250k you need countries to start using it, and bitcoin goes against the people in power who view cash as king.

Happening to me as well, sender showed me proof it was sent but there's nothing at all on our end and its been like an hour.

You're right, 1 post wasn't created by you.

What does that have to do with anything? I said this post was made during a crash.


"Buy this weekend. Might be the lowest price you will see for a while."
Not only is that not an opinion, but your reasoning for it was completely wrong. Not only did you get the reason for the crash wrong, but you didn't even check price history over the past few years which would have shot down your "opinion" immediately.


When did I say anything about this specifically being wrong? 


Not one thing related to bitcoin was correct in this post. What's sensible about that? Judging by your BCH comment earlier, you didn't say why it was going to take a dip, clearly you didn't even know why it rose if you didn't know why bitcoin dropped.
Let me break down your "sensible standard speculation" for you


Nope. Never happened before, googling for 10 seconds would have told you this. If something happens, I can guarantee it will be because of a different reason.


What happens in december? CME *might* start trading on december, and their announcement pushed bitcoin up once. Keep in mind that it could get delayed or cancelled since it's still pending review.
Bitcoin cash is available on bitstamp on December, this is competition for bitcoin and gives people an option to directly invest into that instead of bitcoin, or both. What else is happening where "a lot of things" will happen. Good news for BCH isn't exactly good news for Bitcoin especially in this scenario.


You must be onto something and drops must happen every weekend. Let me check the charts. Nope. The impact is insignificant.


Not sure if you knew, but a lot of alt coins actually rely on bitcoin. A few of them actually have very similar price graphs as bitcoin at certain times. This big wave of growth has already happened and they're riding on bitcoin's growth now. Ripple and Litecoin for example already had their good news that boosted them a bit higher in terms of bitcoin satoshis.
Good thing res gives me an option to ignore users. Now that I've spoonfed you information, I'll go ahead and do that as your "opinions", points and arguments make no sense. Not going to degrade myself any further to prove a point if you didn't get it by now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:00:15
Bitcoin was valued way less than it is now. If he were to hold them all until now, I suppose you can say that. But a lot of people would have sold at a much lower price than it's currently sitting at after each big jump bitcoin experienced.

It's better if you're sending dollars or something backed by the dollars like BHD I believe. You can either receive USD through Western Union and you only pay the sending fee, or they can receive it in Pesos. WU normally charges 2-3% conversion fee. What's silly is some exchanges are also a WU branch, and if you opt for the receive in USD option and then sell them the USD, the conversion doesn't exist. If the sender doesn't specify that the receiver receives in USD, they are forced to go with WU's conversion rates which are generally 2-3% than what google shows.
I'm not sure of other payment methods, I've heard but nothing as mainstream as WU.

Doesn't mean it had anything to do with the information you gave. It started dropping before this post was made, you saw that and made up your own reason based on pure speculation what's causing it, then going as far as even making recommendations when you had no idea why it even went down in the first place. That's pretty reckless advice you were giving based on misinformation.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:31:32
The wonders of res. Not sure why you even bothered replying, not to mention so quick. Just shows you didn't even read it, no surprise there, just goes to show you don't do your research or read to understand what's happening.

Japan has no fee trading until January though. Could easily be inflated. There's no way they account for half without it, they probably account for one of the top 3 and still a big % of the market.

Of course if one of the parties decides to attempt a scam, they review it and you'll have to submit evidence of you sending them the money which is normally really easy.

Don't think it will be the new gold anytime soon. The generation that possesses most of the wealth are the older people, they've been around longer and they've had it easier than the current one. Getting them to make a switch from something as physically appealing as gold for something that is in technology most have little knowledge about will be very tough. Not to mention the amount of gold that go into the jewelry business.
I think it can happen when the more tech savvy generation starts to take over.

I'm not sure how exchanges operates in different countries, but I believe Philippines has one of the best bitcoin exchanges in the world. They have an option to receive bitcoin payments in Philippine Pesos. This means as soon as it confirms, you'll get the same amount of pesos using the rate they had when the transaction was sent out. You can also receive it in bitcoin and exchange it anytime you wish, pay bills, buy phone credit (prepaid is huge here), buy game credits, send money using a remittance or even through bank, along with more features.

The mempool is about to clog as difficulty adjusts increasing bitcoin's fees because miners are switching to bch since it's more profitable to mine. BCH received good news, it went up, and right now it's more profitable to mine that. 
In fact price history since 2014 shows no indication that thanksgiving talks and unable to deposit had any impact on bitcoin's price. Probably best to do research on this before telling people to buy on misinformation you provide them.
Personally I'd recommend to buy bitcoin either way as I believe bitcoin still has a long way upwards to go.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:52:15
I feel the same way if I buy or sell. I bought bitcoin during the recent fairly big dip. When it dropped from 7.5k to 6-6.5k, it hovered around there for a while and I thought it would be safe. So I make the purchase, and I tell a friend that he should dump his bitcoin and prepare for the worst. I've told him and showed him a few times when I bought that it would crash and when I sold it would rise. It dropped from $6.1k to $5.2k around an hour after I bought.
In the end it usually works out in the end when I hodl long enough.

Sometimes there are bots that will automatically undercut you by a cent each time you place an order. The fees are different if you list it yourself, they’re generally lower than if you instantly sold it to the highest bidder. I’m guessing some people eventually gets tired of being undercut.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:18:09
I’m guessing because it can be considered a decent option in case something bad happens. If the economy in your country tanks like it did in Venezuela, you’ll still have bitcoin. Now that’s way less likely to happen in the more developed world but if it does, then it could be huge for bitcoin. I held some after watching this
