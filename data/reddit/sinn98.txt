For people who understand the underlying tech, a lot of those BCH checkmarks are temporarily 'facts' because they enjoy the same moderate volume bitcoin did in the past.

I don't really care how the whole thing evolves or what the original 'satoshi vision' was...just it's disingenuous for this bullet fact list to use low usage of a crypto and put them down as advantages

From what I understand, it is compressed (starts with a 'K'). But how do I uncompress it on bitaddress? I thought they don't support segwit addresses.
Each private key i put into bitaddress 'wallet details' gives me a public key starting with'1' instead of a '3' like I'm looking for
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:03:41
Wow this worked and in such a simple way. Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:35:18
You are the closest thing to giving me hope right now. Clearly I was not ready to use segwit paper wallets as cold storage.
Assuming I still have a valid '3' pub key and 'K' priv key, what must I do in the core client to retrieve it back?

I'm not an expert on the technicals, but I understand that bitcoin's decentralization is a big part of what makes it secure from greedy or malicious actors. 
I've always wanted to run my own node for this reason; to "do my part" so to speak. But I'm just a regular guy with a basic home internet package, and even downloading the current blockchain gets close to breaking my monthly bandwidth limits. It dissuades me from actually doing it, and I think "oh well at least there's a few thousand others doing it for me, still safe i guess". I'm sure I'm not the only average user who's had to weigh this matter.
I think I do understand enough technicals, however, to see that doubling the blocksize means eventually 2X the blockchain size, 2X the bandwidth usage, and 2X the number of people like me who would rather not run a node because their measly home internet package doesn't make it feasible. 
Soon enough, those people will be thinking "oh well, at least there's hundreds of other nodes securing it for me." And that's a slippery slope. Then that same thought will become "...at least there are dozens of nodes keeping this secure for me." See where I'm going with this?

1. Go to bitaddress.org 
2. Save the HTML page onto a thumb drive.
3. Plug thumb drive into a non-networked (i.e. no internet access) computer that preferably has been freshly reformatted and was never connected before (to minimize chance of dormant malware.)
4. Run the html page you saved.
5. You can now generate public/private keys that the internet has never "seen" before.
The reason you can do this is because the addresses (all 2^128 of them) exist already. The moment you deposit bitcoin into one (remember only the public key needs to be known in order to do this), it now exists on the blockchain, without it possibly knowing your private key.

@_date: 2013-12-01 17:30:46
For spending money (low sum, low security): Use an Android wallet app, or a client on your PC. Anything will do as long it's readily-accessible for spending.
For long-term savings (high sum, high security): You want to create a wallet address that the network has never seen, print it on paper, then store that paper to one or two safe places. I gave paper copies to two different relatives, so if one of their house's burn down, there's another to fall back on.
Your question is worded in a way that suggests you need to keep 3 different places for the SAME wallet. This is not true. Have a spending wallet and a savings wallet, and approach their security differently.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:28:54
