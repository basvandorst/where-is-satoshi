It isn't, but mining is even easier to understand.
You have to remember this is the local news, and most of their audience has probably already retired.

There are so many flaws in your statement that I'm overwhelmed by all my choices.

Shun the nonbeliever, shunnnnn...
But yeah, you're right. That's not saying anything against bitcoin. Wish I'd gotten in early, but I can't afford to buy a hundred now. And I doubt btc will multiply by another 20 times in the next two years. It would be nice, though.
You just stated a fact.
You hater.

I'll keep it short because I'm about to pass out, but 1) How did you decide that churches, as a whole, "have enough money"? There are megachurches, and there are shady leaky trailers. Wide spectrum, like many things in life.
If there are people who see value in what OP's dad does, why can't he be compensated for that? 
I'm against exploitation of a congregation, but op shouldn't have to live on the streets either.

Nah I'm not worried.. my only income is an internship so I bought one BTC last year at $120. I had no idea what I was doing at the time and got burned on a fontas "pump". 
Got out with my lesson learned, &amp; 80 or so NMC that are just now getting back to that original $ value. At this point I'm about ready to do what you were saying, and I'm keeping my NMC indefinitely. Wish there was more talk about NMC, but I'm ready to ride it out long term and see what happens.
