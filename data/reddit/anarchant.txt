It sort of makes sense, but tax is self-reported with only a tiny bit of auditing. All the IRS has to know is what your job is and they can get a reasonable guess on what your income is, therefore what you owe.
If people stop paying because their bitcoin address are anonymous, the IRS will still come after them. They'll still know whether you paid or not.

What's bitcoin going to do? Specifically?

You say that as if everyone can and will just collude together and play a schoolyard game of cold shoulder with the government without consequence.
Every option here means a discretion between taxes being received and what's being spent. Think of this on and large scale. It's unrealistic.

Kind of like how it's "political" to be arrested for smoking pot. But that doesn't have anything to do with marijuana itself, that's more about how governments act.

You're surely right that anarchy is an inevitability and tools like bitcoin will get us there. I just disagree that getting away from tax is that easy. The government may be incompetent but they're experts in theft.

That doesn't destroy governments. You'll have to be more specific.

Civil forfeiture. The government "can" literally arrest inanimate objects.

Exactly right. Maybe they changed things, but this "Paybase" homepage doesn't mention any official endorsements.
If it's said in a live chat, I'd point out to be very skeptical of those launch things. The people making them get excited. Jeff Tucker did the same thing at the launch of Liberty.me. Made all kinds of grand promises about "exclusives" and how big the site was going to be. None of it came true.

I love to see lawmakers stumble over their own idiotic laws.

Same thing happened to me today. After 2-weeks of emailing them every single day to fix an account lock (for no reason) they opened it up and I get this message. Fucking christ. 
Mining used to be cool.

I know nothing about Paybase and I have no plans on using it. But chances are when they said "officially endorsed," they meant, "we got a way of discounting items that Amazon doesn't forbid."
Do they actually give you 10% discounts?

They could seize the contracts. Which are virtual... and on a P2P... oh wait.
