I think one of the main problems right now is that transactions are too expensive, which makes bitcoin unsuitable for micro transactions currently. Also, the 10 minute confirmation time is a little bit annoying, or, I should say, makes many interesting potential business models impractical.
The solution to both of these problems is side chains! Can we have them please!

I saw the topic and just felt I had to share this little something I have built:  which allows you to make phonecalls using bitcoins directly from the browser.
The technology is working, but I'm looking for business/marketing people to help me launch this... PM me if you are interested!

That chart is here:
There we can see that the daily transaction volume is around 50 million USD. This means that yearly GDP of the bitcoin economy is around 20 billion USD. This is about the same as the economies of e.g. Congo, Afganistan or Estonia.

    Imagine there's no countries
    It isn't hard to do
    Nothing to kill or die for
    And no religion too
    Imagine all the people
    Living life in peace...
