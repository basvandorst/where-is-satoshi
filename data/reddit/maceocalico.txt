This is big news, but Walmart/Sam's is already on the list. Isnt that a much bigger deal?

I don't believe so, their "rewards program" pays you in BTC.

Not sure about that, but Lolli (the company giving you cash back in the form of BTC at participating retailers) has partnered with Walmart in the same manner as Safeway. 
There are lots of other businesses on the list. Some offering much higher than 3.5%

If being in control of your own thoughts was so great on it's own, we wouldn't have invented religion in the first place...anyone that [has] ever had to deal with morality through his religion or cultural ideology knows that there [are] pros and cons for [both]
I mean imagine [how]  government would work without religion.

I remember when my mom loved me. Now she sends a card with $20 for the kids and a note, "dont buy that crypto shit with this, it's for the kids"

In America we use the phrase: "couldn't care less." One might suppose we were dumb, should we say "could care less." 
No need for tribal separation, there's just those that hodl and those that don't here.

You're spot on, holding off on Birthdays and Winter vacation! Next year the fam is going in a Moon trip.

I never have good luck with Paxful. Everytime I try to sell a gift card the buyer tells me invalid. Then I am forced to redeem the card in order to not get scammed. Love the concept.

I was told I would have a $20k Christmas. Held off on getting the kids presents. Pamp that shit! Wife's pissed.

I find it ironic that this news came out today. April 11th is the date that the previous "Shift Card" issued by Coinbase and Visa and available to US customers is set to terminate. Didn't Europe already have crpto Visa options?

Good question
