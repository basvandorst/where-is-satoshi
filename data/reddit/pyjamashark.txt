Electrum is a good one, too. Bitcoin-Qt as well but only if there is enough space and time for getting the blochchain (20 GB and about 1 day). Using these local wallets eliminates the risk of a third party i.e. website mishandling the money. And obviously it's always recommended making transactions only on malware-free computers.
For business purposes it's good either a local wallet, and then converting to cash occasionally. Or using some gateway like BitPay or Bips.me (

Shortly, because Bitcoin is well suited for purchasing digital goods. The payment processing takes about 10 minutes, there are low fees, and it's relatively anonymous.
Further there is no possibility for chargebacks, which moves some advantage to sellers. Nevertheless buyers in general don't mind spending at well known "legitimate" sites.
If/when the seller desires an immediate conversion into a usual currency such as dollar, there are service providers who do that for about 1% fee, which is in total still better than credit card processing fees.

Interesting thoughts of some of the other big guys. Fiat? We print it, we control their transactions, and the public even thinks it has an intrinsic value. Bitcoin? Ban 'em.

It's a cryptography article, and you don't learn how to steal coins. But if that's what you're into then try selling ASIC pre-orders :o)
It's interesting how Bitcoin and cryptography generally remove the need for trust in other parties, yet so many people do send coins to unknown websites, and then make drama on forums. It's time for escrow services.
@_date: 2013-09-29 09:34:57
The problem of colored coins is that they don't follow the fungibility principle.
Taking 1 gold USD, 1 smelly USD, and 1 stolen USD, each is worth 1 USD. With centrally issued currencies, central banks ensure this so we don't worry about accepting the currency. Likewise with Bitcoin, the community has a convention that 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC.
BTW piggybacking on Bitcoin to store information about company shares is still an interesting idea, however, it is what it says - piggybacking on Bitcoin.

I agree, finally some good and clear explanation.
So is there a global list of stolen USD banknotes with their serial numbers? No there isn't, because 1) it would take lots of legal and police work globally to maintain such a list, 2) it would take lots of effort from the common folks to check every transaction against such a list. The bottom line is that it would result in a chaos quickly. For these obvious reasons there is no such system for USD banknotes, and there isn't one for Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2013-01-10 01:13:48
It depends. If you want just to do trading, you can transfer BTC into MTGox, do trading, and then transfer BTC out. If you want to buy BTC for GBP at good price then buy them in the UK as people advise here. Also there are many more exchanges if you can pay in EUR.

Not only they deserve more rights, they already have more rights - than what the government seems to admit. Everyone is free to print and use "monopoly money" or do barter trading.
Morally, people are entitled for privacy. That's also financial. Governments shouldn't be sticking noses into people's wallets, or even blocking or confiscating bank accounts.
(How about criminal money? e.g. If you happen to be a criminal and stole 10 cars, the court should sentence you for 5 years for the theft, and order you to repay the victims - if you don't, you get extra 5.)
Back to the topic, yes it's right that Bitcoin Foundation responsed back legally, but I think that the government sees their legal options only as part of their options. It's like first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you in the media, then they fight you in the court ... (?)

Still some member of such network would end up selling tainted coins. If localbitcoins perform escrow they may catch the sender. But it would be more difficult if he sells them in small amounts in person. I think you are right that such system is unlikely to happen.

One day there will be both nodes with pruned blockchain and nodes with full blockchain. I understand that pruning old spent transactions is not a security issue. 
It's also possible to imagine some solution for pruning transactions with miniscule outputs. For example it could be agreed to treat all unspent outputs below 0.0001 BTC before block 210,000 as spent, and prune the blockchain accordingly. Like it's not fair clogging world's harddisks with penny transactions forever.

Just a brain-storming. Some big players like exchanges could agree on a public shared blacklist for mutual protection from hackers. If some exchange suffers a theft, they can put the coins on the list within hour, and if another participating exchange receives such coins, they can report the sender for investigation. It would work well if the thief attempts to cash out quickly. However, if the thief puts the coins into a mixer then everyone participating in the mixing may be questioned (ideally mixers should prevent mixing coins with thieves, or will be asked questions). If the thief spends the coins in a shop, the merchant may be questioned but he can just point in the thief's direction. If the evil thief also attempts to taint some public donation addresses, such receivers would ideally be notified and would donate such coins back to the theft victims. TL;DR creating such blacklist would be awkward but could be attempted.

Store of value he confirmed.
Medium of exchange he denied because "you can't pay bills with bitcoins". But he fails to say that there are number of online shops where people can pay with bitcoins.
Measure of value he denied because they value stuff in dollars and reprice to bitcoins (he meant those shops I think). While mainly true, let's look at it this way: Stuff produced in Japan is valued in yens and then it's repriced to other currencies as exported. If the yen exchange rate fluctuates, the stuff needs to be repriced. So some small economies importing from Japan better peg their rates to yen to avoid recalculating so often. Bitcoin has only a very small economy, mainly "imports" stuff, and doesn't peg to other currencies. In my opinion pegging to another currency would actually make it a "less currency". I think it's rather the small economy that should be improved - to boost it as the medium of exchange.

I say irrational exuberance, or we've entered a bubble stage just 3 times bigger as in 2011.
Current price may match the reality at some point in the future but not right now. Without a hard fork the real transaction volume may grow max 10 fold, assuming pushing out all SatoshiDice transactions by increased tx fees. Then acceptance of "raw coin", i.e. without conversion, is still not reality in the mainstream, and switching to and back means extra costs.
So maybe it will hit 100 in few weeks but with risk of going back to 20 in case of any bad news.

IMHO if any government decides to buy BTC in big amounts, they would do it quietly. Going public about it would do harm to their own currency (more than when being quiet).

But yes, such sudden changes are not good. Furthermore, the microtransactions pay fees already so how about increasing the fees instead of banning them? We are not in communist Russia, presumably ;)
edit: Just realized that SatoshiDice are not lost yet but they will have to make deals with miners, so their satoshi transaction would make it into blocks. It's still such a communist solution. Everybody can see that the main cost driver here is the information content. If you send to 1 address (~250 byte) you pay 0.0005 BTC. For 20 addresses (~5000 byte) you should pay 0.01 BTC. The client software can easily calculate this. $200 for 1 megabyte stored on tens thousand of computers is maybe cheap.

Well, I wouldn't mind being such a saver but actually I don't insist people would be making long-term profits from holding. Just shouldn't make loss like with inflationary money. Actually deflation in Bitcoin is rather a replacement word for the expected value increase during the phase of widespread adoption. Then the only other reason for deflationary Bitcoin would be people losing wallets. Not nice and hopefully it won't happen much. And then there is also the pre-programmed increase of the monetary base. So I don't think there will be any heavy deflation. I think it will be bit like gold - people are not worried to keep gold even if some gold is mined every day (and some is lost in sunk ships, etc).

@_date: 2013-04-21 08:29:45
Yes, one of the 2 transactions will fail.
The long answer is that the system is designed to prevent such double-spend attempts. If you broadcast the transactions like you say, at worst you can manage that some Bitcoin nodes receive one, and other nodes get the other. But later only one of the tx will be included in a block and the other tx will be forgotten by everyone. All normal nodes will act like this.
Then even if some evil node joins the network, it's not a problem as long as they don't have more than 50% of mining rate. When they submit an invalid block, it will be ignored by normal majority miners and won't become part of the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-01-05 17:54:09
IMHO, even if the mining depended just on fees, some market equilibrium of transaction fees would be established.
When numbers of submitted transactions grow over the imposed network limit, the users will need to move to some higher fees level to ensure timely processing. Miners will fill their blocks only with transactions paying higher fees. The users who find the fees too high will use alternative payment systems. This alone will create the equilibrium.
The miners will need to adapt to this. For some the fees may be too low and they will quit the mining competition, leaving more revenue for the others. And for some newcomers the fees may be favourable and they will join the mining competition. The risk of all miners leaving because of too low fees is not real because at some point the remaining miners actually will be profitable. Maybe it would be similar to the hashing power decrease after the reward halving recently.

Technically yes but banks usually have some trust in each other. It's not like if a bank saw a chainsplit they would scramble to do a double-spend. If it happened that 6 blocks were rolled back by the network, they'd probably just send it again later.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:38:10
Yes, markets too, but people expect some more fundamental valuation. You know, markets consist of traders, traders make mistakes, and sometimes even collective mistakes.
So gold, it's yellow, it's shiny, and it weighs a lot. If all else fails, it can always be used for making nice yellow mirrors and as ballast on ships ;) Well, people like some intrinsic value so here you go.
With the fiat, saying that it's valuable because it's accepted for paying taxes, is pretty odd. If all else fails, you can pay taxes with it. Wow. Ok there was another reason that the Fed would always buy back your dollars in a case of trouble. Buy back for gold? Land? Could they offer trillions of dollars in such assets? Most likely not.
And yes, the unique Bitcoin payment system gives bitcoins a fundamental value. But it's hard to estimate how much. Decentralized, partially anonymous, with low fees. But governments like to control money of their citizens, which is bit complicated with Bitcoin. So maybe one day they could choose to outlaw it. Would people oppose such decision? Would Bitcoin cease to exist?
TL;DR What gives a value to the thing, is the trust that other people will also atribute it a value. The thing could be gold, fiat, or bitcoins.

Off-chain transactions would be processed instantly, without waiting for 10 minute confirmations. Also it's meant for the massive BTC adoption one day, when gigabytes of transactions would become difficult to process on-chain. Even if those limits are distant actually.
It's interesting how the proposal goes very close to - but avoids - fractional reserve banking :) It's nice how it temporarily locks down the BTC for the banker and some group of people who then track the ownership themselves. But indeed there are the trust issues.
I think I can still imagine "full reserve" banking. To prove that he is not "fractional", the banker would regularly prepare a balance sheet. On the asset side there would be a couple of well-known BTC addresses owned by the banker. On the liabilities side there would be his customer accounts with their balances. Concerning security, also here the banker would need to prepare contingent transactions which would release BTC to their owners in an event of disaster. Then there is one more trouble, that the banker would be tempted run away with the money. This would be partially resolved by the setup in which withdrawals from the "main vault" would need signatures of multiple trusted people. TL;DR Alice doesn't have to trust Bob at all but Alice needs additional trust to Ultra that they don't run away with the money.

Great article about the money velocity.
But along with the transactional motives for holding money, there are also the speculative motives. If also saying there is a chance of thousands-fold appreciation in few years, this motive seems pretty relevant just now.
Concerning that foul trading activity, it's just a great chance for skilled traders (or trading bots) to identify those patterns, counter-act them, and make some good money. Free market :)
I think the BTC is bit like the Schroedinger's cat - worth both 0 and 1,000,000 at the same time ;)

What? There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin security, and there's nothing wrong with the fees, and it's still fine to send transactions worth few USD-cents - even if I don't insist on having microtransactions.
See, everyone is perfectly free to choose online or offline. If you're tempted to put your gold into a bank, it's your decision.
Oh ok, you seem to be talking about the extraordinary Bitcoin future. When the usage will expand like 1000 times and the hardware capacity will become a limit. Indeed this will be a situation when the fees would have to rise to ensure timely processing of transactions. What will be the fees? Decided by the market. There will be users who prefer Bitcoin and will pay slightly higher fees. And there will be users who prefer GooglePal and their lower fees ;)

The price is decided by the market based on supply and demand. On the supply side there is always some limited amount of BTC. On the demand side I actually admit it's difficult to give some calculation of value, since values that people attribute to various things are subjective. Like if it's a friction-less currency and people believe that it's going to be very useful in the future then they attribute it some higher value perhaps.
At some stage also Google was a small business and only few people believed in it. It's quite possible that those people were later rewarded a big time. Unfair?
BTW if anyone thinks that a price is too high for what it's worth, they are completely free not to buy.

Agree. The first half is a great Bitcoin intro. In the second he's repeating various memes he must know are not necessarily correct.
E.g. deflation = bad. He knows that the deflation is a growth in value, not a loss of value. So should the deflation cause some trouble to the Bitcoin economy, then it would feed back and slow down the deflation.
I think it's a great article still.

It seems that by selling lots of particular currency the public would get "too much cash" and that currency would devaluate against everything. The central bank would need to buy this cash away by selling off some their reserves i.e. other currencies or gold. The other option is to raise interest rates, so their borrowers, e.g. government, are not so eager to borrow, and possibly depositors are eager to deposit. There are some obvious limits in which this could be done but such limits are usually big enough to counter most "groups of wealthy inidividuals".

Internet is not strictly required for sending bitcoins. Take the seller's address, sign a transaction for him, send the transaction directly to him. I think there are necessary commands in Electrum. Sending the transaction could be done via some temporary wifi connection.

Possible but unlikely imho. Thinking of SEC. Anyway this is not the core discussion of colored coins. The core discussion is that they piggyback on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-03-30 13:12:31
What exactly is the problem?
Are there rich Bitcoin holders? Yes. Are there many more other rich people out there? Yes. There is no problem for some big company to come and buy 50% of all Bitcoins - if they are willing to pay the market price. Why don't they? Because there is a risk of price going down. Some people take this risk and some don't. It's really like an investment. About hoarders: If a hoarder wishes to keep his Bitcoins, I wish him good luck. If he decides to spend them, he's not a hoarder anymore. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 13:47:09
Empirically, hoarding leads to the growth in the value of the held asset.
Supposing all money is replaced by BTC, there would be no inflation, or at least not in practice as the BTC adoption effect would offset the scheduled BTC inflation. Governments couldn't make losses and cover them by printing more money (resp. borrowing from central banks who print them), they simply need to balance taxes and spending.
Deflationary BTC holders would have couple of options:
A) People can choose to *hoard* BTC, thus consume less now &amp; more later, thus people need to produce less now and work less now. These hoarders then receive the hidden "deflationary interest".
B) People can choose to *spend* BTC, thus consume more now &amp; less later, thus people need to produce more now and work more now. These spenders don't pay or receive anything extra.
C) People can choose to *invest* their BTC, thus consume less now &amp; more later. They buy shares of some business, and later usually get it back with some profit. Thus such business can spend more on their employees, people work more now, people produce more now. These investors get back their investment with profit (or loss), plus the hidden "deflationary interest".
When trying to apply the same under the current inflationary system, the spending option B) is just the same. The investment option C) is similar, except that the investor pays inflationary interest, instead of receiving deflationary interest. The hoarding option A) is not good for inflationary money because it means both less consumption now and paying inflationary interest.

Not only that, the official client has a limit of 1,000 tx per block, with maximum 144,000 tx per day. It's something about fees calculation. But I think there will eventually be solutions for these limits.
In fact nowadays the vast majority of traffic is infamous SatoshiDice so there is still a plenty of space for serious transactions. All you have to do is to add to your tx a reasonable fee, say 0.01 BTC, and miners will process it with priority.

In fact there is a possibility for offline transactions but just in the sense that the buyer doesn't have to be online. He can sign a transaction and hand it over to the seller. However, the seller then needs to submit and verify that transaction online. Similar how the credit / debit cards work.

Erik, thanks for the balanced view.
I think that things always have such a value, that masses attribute to it. Be it gold, tulips, dollars, or bitcoins. The only "intristic" values are how they are easy to store, transfer, or how stable they are, and that's basically it.
For Bitcoin the main risk of going to zero are eventual failures of the few centralized points: Bitcoin development, and big service providers like MtGox. Bitcoin nodes don't really have alternative implementations to Satoshi client, even if open source. If Satoshi client goes belly up, Bitcoin goes belly up. If MtGox goes offline, big trouble too.

The whole matter would not work.
With whitelisting there are white coins and unknown coins. When moving white coins further in private transactions, they would presumably lose their white color and get marked unknown. It's because the database wouldn't know if you got your coins from that mexican person in a legitimate transaction or not. And even less about any previous private transactions. But sure it would know that all the initial inputs were mined by Yifu. Then also it is not clear if / how could be such coins painted white again. By pointing out the short time / few transactions that separate the owner from the closest whitelisted transactions?  By documenting the private transactions of all the preceeding owners? By selling the coins at a discount price? Ouch. To conclude, this would not only require checking of all received coins but also would effectively ban any private transactions. Which the users refuse.
With blacklisting there are black coins and unknown coins. Unlike the white color, the black taint spreads and remains rather than disappears. Even if the black spreads possibly at a slower rate that the white disappears, with time it would be more and more likely to be paid some tainted coins. Again what would be the ways to handle or clean the coins? Pointing out the long time / many transactions that separate the owner from the original blacklisted transaction? Selling the coins at a discount price? Surely the users would need to be checking all the coins they receive. And then who decides which coins get blacklisted: authorities of USA, Russia, or China? or Yifu? ...
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:47:42
The obvious question is whether once stolen money that you have been paid are still considered stolen.
Even if legally they could be seen as stolen, such law is simply not enforced imho. Imagine police comming to you "We have identified that the $20 bill you paid today was stolen in 1970 in Japan". And even if it were stolen last week, most people don't care about banknote serial numbers and such investigation is unlikely to identify more than few last steps in the transaction chain.

The more secure wallet, the more complex the solution:
People say that web-based  is easy for beginners but I don't know it myself.
Then you can try the official Bitcoin-Qt aka. Satoshi client  it takes few GB on harddisk and 1-2 days to initialize the database, but you have everything stored on your PC and don't need to rely on websites. For backup you can backup wallet.dat or dump and print the private keys, and store them somewhere safe.
Then you can try some of the light-weight clients, e.g. Electrum  Armory, MultiBit, Bitcoin Wallet for Android. They require much less space and initialization time, but don't provide full nodes to the network. Electrum has a neat "brain wallet" feature where you can remember 12 seed words and use them to restore your wallet if needed.
