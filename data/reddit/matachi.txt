Companies today aren't printing dollar bills when they need to pay their employees' salaries.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:29:18
Yup, that will save Bitcoin. And don't forget all important altcoins!

Apple have their own payment system and their own in-app purchase system which they get a big cut from (30 % IIRC). And after removing all these Bitcoin apps from Appstore, why are there still people who don't get that they don't want to have any Bitcoin apps in their store?
There was one guy on LTB who read quotes from their review guidelines to "prove" why this was wrong from Apple's side. But Apple doesn't have to follow those guidelines - it's their phone, their store and their review process! Why should a piece of paper restrict them from removing Bitcoin apps from their store?
IMO it's better to give up on closed ecosystems like Apple and move to something else more free and open.

If this is a major flaw that might bring down all coins, shouldn't we be honest about it? I doubt delaying the inevitable will do any good for anybody.

They can always transfer the tips to a second address that they are 100% sure that only they control.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:35:57
Yeah, I agree. Either the Bitcoin protocol needs to get patched or else I think we should watch this unfold without intervention. If Bitcoin breaks when they get over 50%, I think it's better if that happens sooner than later. The crash will just get larger if we postpone it. But maybe the strategy is to hold on for a little while longer to get enough time to do something about the protocol. Having Gavin's threats as a last defence does at least not sound like a viable solution.

In Sweden, where I live, we don't even have a symbol for our currency Krona. Here are some examples of how prices are written: "100 kr", "100 kronor", "100:-", "100", "100:00", "100,00". I don't believe it's essential that Bitcoin has a dedicated Unicode symbol for us to be able to express prices.

What does what you are saying have to do with the ever more centralized mining? Will stopping the printing presses prevent GHash from getting majority of the mining?
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:08:07
Sweden included – cool. Gotta try it out!
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:34:03
Panic price? Lol
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:18:30
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't 100 bits translate to 2 cents? Or am I getting my math wrong?
@_date: 2016-01-01 09:37:43
I also thought of vote as being an analogy.

It's a miracle that this hasn't been censored yet
@_date: 2016-01-01 09:34:42
Do Redditors think this is valid? The comment score is hidden so it's hard to tell without more comments replies
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:31:30
How can a fork reach consensus without discussion? Bitcoin is too important for discussions about its future to be censored.

What's the transaction fee when using Bitcoin on Steam?
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:48:03
I like Deluge, and that's what I went to from uTorrent, however, it had some bugs and didn't feel that solid. qBittorrent on the other hand has been rock solid.
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:45:36
It comes pre-installed on Fedora, so I often end up using it. However, I feel like qBittorrent gives me more options and control, so it's the client I always recommend to people.
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:49:15
Transmission is available on Linux.

The timestamp is in the URL. The video should start play automatically at the interview, which is at 50m 46s. Works for me in Firefox.

He is like the greatest man of our time and I'm pretty sure that there are more Bitcoin owners than 144 people. And also, it's not like it's hard to make a Bitcoin transaction. 8-)

Screw the government. I don't want their regulations

Yeah, Stack Exchange is already built solely for Q&amp;A.

They are constantly under ddos... Riiiight 
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:35:11
I donated some days ago when I saw their address on a torrent on Pirate Bay. :-P
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:14:25
Yeah, exactly my thought. And it's not a secret that Microsoft provides NSA with information about security holes before they are patched in Windows. Not that I think NSA would steal bitcoins, but Microsoft have more interests than only their users and they are a bit dirty. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:56:07
They don't even support Linux tho :-\ I mean, they don't want open OS, so probably they don't want open currency 
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:22:00
Eh, I strongly believe Sweden would cooperate with USA

Definitely cheaper, but I have to say that the black Bitcoin license plate from 2 weeks ago was really pimp. B-)

Lol, I wish that was the case. I only have a few dozen bitcents on my cellphone. :-)

They don't provide Mac ports of ALL their games, but they still have Mac games on GOG. I only want them to have Linux versions of games that have Linux versions. I never asked them to port their back catalogue.

How do you know they are cheap? Maybe the price will fall even more 
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:10:49
And GPL doesn't force websites to publish the source code, since the user is never interacting with a local, binary file. However, if it was licensed under AGPL they would need to publish the source code. But now they aren't violating anything.
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:45:17
I believe I have seen another Bitcoin address on a torrent from them on Pirate Bay, so they probably have more money than that 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:01:11
Yeah, I want to leave.
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:30:32
The very same discussions and arguments that where present during the bubble in April 
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:33:14
Lol, like a real pimp 
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:03:26
Haha, a bunch of retards all in one place. It's funny how anti everything they seem to be. But then they are probably only kids. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:48:25
Just want to say that I love your two shows! 
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:57:33
Yeah, it's very well-made!
@_date: 2013-05-24 08:50:41
The chosen one! 
@_date: 2013-08-27 11:55:25
Don't think so, it doesn't seem like they have integrated Bitcoin into their service. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:22:38
Only 144 transactions though. I mean, the man is a hero, at least a dollar I hope most people would be able to spare. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:49:18
Lol, great one 
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:47:25
Yeah, I don't get why an alternative, digital currency that everybody can use would be considered bad.
