I think you missed my point. Bitcoin doesn't have *any* potential right now because it's completely unusable as a currency. You want to educate people on something that doesn't exist. The technology has to exist before it can be adopted.

How exactly will it help the less fortunate? Bitcoin is a speculative asset, why the hell would anyone without disposable income put money into it?

You are so delusional it's actually pretty sad.

Just because there are a lot of great developers working on Bitcoin doesn't mean all the best developers are *only* working on Bitcoin. And the whole block size debate that has spanned several years should be a great example that solving problems isn't as simple as developers writing the code for it.

I can't be bothered to check how many developers are working on every major project, but for a quick example, Ethereum has roughly half as many contributors to its core as Bitcoin.

Except unlike gold, it will not hold its value over time. Once people realize it has no use as a currency, demand for it will drop, investors will start selling and it will tank.

You call someone else untechnical and then say dumbass things like "the best devs in the world" and "there are no better coins." I doubt you have any idea what you're talking about, but just for shits and giggles maybe you can explain to everyone why exactly you think every single one of these other cryptocurrency projects that were started with the idea of addressing certain problem(s) that exist in Bitcoin got it wrong.

LOL, a lot longer than that, kid.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:13


Uhh, no. Gold has value because it's useful; it doesn't rust or corrode, it's malleable, low melting point, etc, and there aren't a lot of metals like it. And I didn't say it was usable as a currency, I said Bitcoin (its only real usecase) isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:06:52
Wow, almost a decade! And how long has gold been valuable?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:03
Uhh, I'll call BS. Prove it's the same people.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:30:06


And that's exactly why Bitcoin will never see mass adoption.

You must be an idiot, then. Unbiased facts are what newcomers need, not whatever your friend's opinions on it are. Oh your friend has worked in the industry for a few years? Get that fallacious bullshit out of here.

Stop adding bold to your comments, jackass.

That's similar to what Factom does, although its credits aren't used as a currency but for data verification.

Charlie you look like a fucking tool

It was probably late 2013 through 2014, when [the price of bitcoin mostly fell for about a year]( We're probably in for something similar, although it likely won't drop back to the level it was in 2015.

I personally have sold most of my holdings because I think there's too much uncertainty about what will happen to the prices, and I'm going to buy back in sometime after August 1st after this is mostly resolved.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:49:01
Okay, see you in 2017.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:01:35
I sold most of my holdings a couple days ago. I've seen too many posts like this one, so there's too much uncertainty around Aug 1st for me to risk existing profits.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:14:28


Why?
