LN uses segwit. Segwit has a fee discount of ~38% over regular tx. Thus it  is less than 1 sat/byte but it's 1 sat/vbyte the latter taking "weighted" size in account. fun fact: lnd has sat_per_byte as a setting but not vbyte so you're still overpaying if you set it to 1.

ACINQ is likely the problem they could use a remote balance with you as they route lots for eclair

LN wallet seems smarter to try other channels while eclair is stuck trying the lowest fee next hop...
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:28:29
I had this prob with a channel to ACINQ open. It's preferred by eclair as it charges no base fees but then fails to find a route. Closing channel to ACINQ made it work. Note ACINQ is the default channel provider for eclair
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:38:23
thx. so segwit discount only kicks in for larger tx or once fee levels are above 1 sat/byte?
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:28:43
In terms of fees: When the tip of the mempool is at 1 sat/byte meaning all tx will fit the next block does it make a difference or will you still need to pay the same fee?

Why on earth did Satoshi implement nlocktime...
Let me remind you: "One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties. They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement. The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version. If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime. If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out. Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast. Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network. Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw."  quote from 
Edit: Let's add another quote by Meni Rosenfeld wrt to banks:
"The most important difference in my view is that, unlike banks, LN hubs don’t hold your money. Your money is stored in a channel, anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, and only you can authorize its movement. In any case that the channel counterparty refuses to cooperate, due to malice or incompetence, you can unilaterally close the channel and receive the money back as normal bitcoins." Source:
Privacy - you can choose to increase privacy over normal blockchain tx by using a longer path to your destination. Onion routing obfuscates where the funds ultimately came from. Hubs may be good for liquidity at large but no one forces you to connect to them directly or route exclusively through them. Connect towards the edge of the network and use several hops to make your LN payment...

No one. The idea is to have a certain amount of default once in a while to clean out unsustainable loans and for lenders to ask a certain price for their risk and time.
However these days loans, especially large ones must not default and lending rates are too low to reflect real risk. Rates cannot rise much either because again, this would cause defaults. It will end in a currency reform of some sort. Question is when...

I could not explain some of the channel closures I've been experiencing - but the remote side would not close a channel I opened because of fees? Unless it was in her interest depending on how the channel is balanced... 
I see a possible DoS vector here. Fill up the mempool to close out a good number of LN channels which in turn cascades to fee pressure. Surely it should depend on some median fee over 144 blocks or something to account for spikes... still an attack vector to take into account..

Thanks for improving on my answer. It was the best I could come up with from the top of my head on mobile...
Can you link the strict rules wrt Bitcoin ATMs, b/c I have not seen a definite comment by bafin the the matter yet

bitpay doesn't accept ltc / eth so it should not be

For unbacked futures they will suffer in a force majeure event b/c they'll be compensated in USD shitcoin. Bitcoin users less affected.

So I can now sell my BOOTY on LN for BTC to fellow SPANKers?
DAI is another stablecoin (1 USD = 1 DAI) using ERC20 so this is kind of a decentralized exchange going using LN... great stuff
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:09:34
consequently some think BCH is Bitcoin ;)

Last estimate for unaccounted funds was in 2001 and had a figure of 2.3 trillion unaccounted for. Somehow other events that year buried the issue until now...

BAFIN, the German finance regulator, has been pretty cloudy. They have not yet granted permission for the operation of such ATM. It's unclear whether you really need one or how you'd apply but potential operators have been hesitant to take possible heat.
localbitcoin is not operating in Germany for the same reason; poloniex has recently updated their TOS to exclude Germany. btc-24 an exchange operating from Germany in 2012 is currently being discussed in court and might lead to some clarification in the matter. The local court stated Bafin was overreaching in trying to establish the financial nature of Bitcoin.
So by running this ATM someone is prepared to clarify the legal status of operating BTC ATMs and trading Bitcoin in Germany.

It might be prudent to convert your savings to BTC before you ravage your country and bail-down the Euro...

With the fundamentals by OP it's a nobrainer to invest in Bitcoin. Yet normies won't do it and later envy and complain how hodlers got rich...

energy is too cheap and can be paid with inflated fiat currency... bitcoin is self-regulating in terms of power usage. increase the price of power and mining power consumption will be down. 
Subsidies by govt on fossil fuel based energy does the opposite of course...

The same applies for all other fiat currencies

You need to get a lightning wallet, establish a channel, rebalance it so you can receive funds and then you could withdraw it. It's not fake but not exactly easy for the novice...

Futures are not supposed to affect the spot price of the underlying. Yet they do in this case and in many others. Is this admitting to price management (aka manipulation)?
