I have no interest in going to college as it plays no part in facilitating the life I want to live.

Seems like so much work though. Honestly I don't really care about it, I don't have anything I desire to buy. I built my house for free and I have all the food I need so I really don't have any desire to manage a bunch of investments. If I were to invest in just a couple things, what would be the best areas to consider in your mind? I deeply appreciate your thoughts.

Why is it better to buy it in increments as opposed to just buying it all at once?

Much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:57:38
Why is that?

Much appreciated friend. I will look into gold.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:19:18
By learning today that I have $32,000, spending a couple hours trying to figure out what to do with it, and asking a question about it.

Why split it up? Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:37:49

That saying has not been true in my life at all.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:17:04
Could you elaborate? I'm very new to this. I have not made up my mind, it is simply an idea. From what I have gathered it seems that Bitcoin is more secure than federal reserve notes, or keeping my inheritance in a money market account. Is this a misconception on my part?
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:41:36
Much appreciated.

I really appreciate that, I've just been thinking about this. I am a certified holistic health coach so I will make some money that way and continue putting some money in Bitcoin on a weekly basis. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:11:52
I think that you get it. To me it's not an investment. It's an incredible evolution and a tool to empower.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:39:52
Thank you very much friend.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:04:55
I appreciate the sentiment but everything real that I have has been freely given to me by the Earthly Mother. Maybe that's a bit woo woo for you but it is an indisputable truth in my life.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:38:22
And you feel it would be okay to put the rest into Bitcoin? I appreciate your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:18:05
Much appreciated! Is it just important to diversify so you don't lose it all on one investment, or is there more to it?
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:33:32
Good call, I will look into that. Unfortunately that is all due to animal agriculture and factory farming but I will see if there is a worthy charity.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:13:52
Much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:39:53
It's not. I wouldn't need any money if I were to start a family. I already built my home and I have an abundance of free food all around me. I don't trust the US government and federal reserve so for me it's more about getting out of a corrupt system. In my eyes Bitcoin/crypto is the future and the more I read and watch the more clear it is to me. It's not really an "investment" to me. Anyways, I've already made up my mind. Thank you for your thoughts.

It seems that the only reason you feel it would be unintelligent is that it would be my sole investment. Feel free to correct me. Is there any inherent flaw in Bitcoin that makes you apprehensive or is it just the simple fact that it would be my sole investment? I greatly appreciate your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:41:54
Okay, thanks. That is good to hear. Did you do a wire transfer or SWIFT, or something else?
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:03:44
Thanks friend. Their site says 2-4 weeks now. I decided to buy some through Coinbase in the meantime since I imagine that the price could increase more than the Kraken-Coinbase price difference by the time I actually get verification on Kraken.
