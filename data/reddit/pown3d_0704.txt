With that point I can concur.

I dont even use coin exchanges. Every coin I've ever bought was private. Cash deals. Then used to buy things, donate, etc. 
Literally blank. No one knows who or where my coins came from. 
Just saying, its a valid point to not give out info, ever.

Down votes, sir.

Uhhh bills, yes. Car? No.. I paid cash for that. All 30 grand. 
I'm just saying you can seriously limit your exposure. Target had a data breach. If I had used CC info at target, I'd probably call my Credit Union and get new cards. If I was able to pay in BTC or LTC, well then its not a problem.

At least its in your control. In a bank it isn't, hence federal insurance. Which is nice, I guess, but I have my wallet backed up online as well as on a redundant RAID disk setup. I'm not going to lose it. 
And PayPal has borders, because my bank has borders. My bank won't allow purchases outside the US, so PayPal won't let my cards go through. Fuck that, bitcoin is so much easier.

They actually have a system in place to remove all DRM on games you own if they go under.

Maleware on my virtual machine? That would be quite the trick.

I mined it for a few months. Made enough to pay off my electric bill for my whole house plus a bit for a few months.  Sold the plus bit at $40 a coin, sold the spare mining hardware, got a bitchin gaming PC out of the miner, and haven't looked back. 
I did pretty good for not having the slightest idea what I was doing.

Recovery and password change. Just like anything else.

I've bought tons of stuff with bitcoin. It was fast, easy, required no personal information, and is mostly private. 
Why would I get a bank, apply for a debit card, use the card, enter a pin, etc if i could just take a scan of a QR code with my phone and be done?

Guess it depends how the fuck you lost your wallet? They are pretty secure. How is someone going to access my wallet on a Virtual Hard Drive that can only be accessed on a USB drive that is encrypted with True Crypt and password protected using 100+bit randomly generated passwords?
Then the whole virtual hard drive is backed up. Its not hard. It took as much time as setting up a normal bank account would.

Its just a point. All my BTC purchases have been fast and easy. No numbers to remember or anything. Yeah, security might be an issue if you lose your phone, but same goes for a lot of things if you lose your phone
