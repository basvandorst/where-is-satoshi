forgive me for any generous misunderstanding: but when u say proportional number reward are u saying for every ONE BITCOIN we hold that we get TWO in Total as our Reward?
...for example if i hold 5 btc in my wallet at the time of the hardfork i will receive 10 Free Bitcoin (b2x)

can someone help me to understand the meaning of this:
a proportional number of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoins as a reward for their commitment to progress.”
does the above me for example mean; if i have 1 Bitcoin does that mean i will get 1 more from Satoshi Nakamoto's Trust Fund :) and the origiinal 1 Bitcoin for having 1  Bitcoin in my wallet?
not so sure what proportional means in the above...
im in hope that for each 1 Bitcoin we receive 2 !!! that would b a great xmas new years gift from Satoshi :)
... thanks guyzzz!!!
