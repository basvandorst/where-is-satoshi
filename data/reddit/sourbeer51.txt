Just like my volcano insurance business. They're everywhere!

Panic buying. Haha

Well you see, the Earth's crust is made up of many tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving over an ocean of magma in the Earth's mantle. There are two main types of plates. There's Oceanic and Continental plates.
    
When plates move toward each other things can happen depending on whether it is a continental-continental or an oceanic-continental  pushing against each other. (Convergent Zone)
    
Convergent boundaries occur where two plates slide towards each other to form either a subduction zone. (if one plate moves underneath the other)  At zones of continent-to-continent subduction the dense oceanic lithosphere plunges beneath the less dense continental. The subducted plate partially melts; and magma rises to form continental volcanoes. 
    
Continental-Continental plate convergent boundaries don't necessarily make volcanoes so i'm going to bypass that part. 
    
Now you see, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging. A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. 
    
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. - Which is why my volcano insurance business is booming. Just when you think you're safe from a volcano...Guess what. You're not and you wont be covered by normal homeowners insurance for that 4 ton of volcanic ash that has just made your roof collapse.

My cousin sent me a link. Saying pretty much the same Thing. I told him I'm stocking up when they're cheap. Bound to rise again.

Me! I sold at 300 in 2014. I made back what it cost for my graphics cards. So I was content with that.

I sold at 300. Whoops.

This is literally the only thing that says this..I need more proof than just one blog. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:38:50
While that may be true that it conflicts with the other email.. The article is false. Fidelity is a conservative investment firm and wouldn't dabble in such volatile non-established market, Bitcoin isn't a currency yet. Why would they even TRY to get into it. Sure they've discussed it im sure but the general consensus is that until it becomes regulated (which it cant) no legitimate financial institution wants to touch it.

What I meant to say was *fully* regulated. Like physical currency. But yeah it can be somewhat. I can agree with that.

Much coin.
