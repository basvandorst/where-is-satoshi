Protip: If it deals with scam altcoins, it's probably a scammy exchange.

I can't believe those fools fell for such an obvious scam! They should have instead totally bought (insert name of any altcoin here)!!! It's guaranteed to beat Bitcoin!

Downvote given for child like whining about downvotes. Grow up.

According to them it's all Obama's fault.

You mean your friend got scammed using a scamcoin?  Hope he never sees on of those coins again. It'll be a good lesson for him.

Actually, Scrypt was originally promoted as being "CPU-mining only!" and we got told over and over and over how it was "mathmatically impossible" to do GPU mining. Opps, turns out a small cabal knew all along the lie and were mining on GPUs.  But don't worry, it's mathmatically impossible for it to be mined on ASICs! Ooopppppps. Lied to again!
The history of Litecoin, and by extension of Doge, is a series of lies and the suckers who believed them.
As for faster transaction times, if you think 2 minutes or even 30 seconds for confirmation is any better in practice than you need to think about it some more.  They're no better for POS transactions.  Go to starbucks and wait for the 5-10mins for full 6 confirm time. Still waaaaaaaaay to long.  Online transaction? Who cares.  Literally no reason to care.

You are correct and it is a bit embarrassing for us adults that enjoy Bitcoin.

I work with a lot of small business owners who still think this way in 2014 :/

Saying "shady" and "alt-coin developer" is a bit redundant.

is one of the worst subreddits.
Nearly every suggestion you find there, regardless of the circumstances or scenario, is either "Save more money!" or "Do the thing that you said you can't do!"
Don't even waste time there.

The one that is nothing more than a boring copy/paste of Bitcoin that fooled a thousand suckers with a nonsensical ad campaign.

Just got news that a peercoin user got grounded by his mom. Peercoin users down to two.

It's so refreshing to see others are smart enough to see why altcoins are doomed to fail and may take Bitcoin with them.  I could kiss you!  Too often I see altcoin apologists repeat the same garbage.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:24:36
You're right. It appears there are more than 3 people interested in Paycoin so it has *that* over peercoin.

Scammers gonna scam.
That said, I have a plan to make an altcoin that is one infinity times better than bitcoin. I will call this coin PrettyOKcoin.  Please use changetip to give me Bitcoin which I apparently don't think is good enough and needs to be improved with another coin.
Thank you.

I mean sure, dogecoin, paycoin, flappycoin, nyancoin, fedoracoin, feathercoin, ripple, dipple, whipple, and shmiple were all scamcoins BUT THIS ONE IS FOR REAL BECAUSE REASONS!

Something is happening, alright.
Some thing is happening in my pants.
