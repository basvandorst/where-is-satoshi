Why is it that all the ~~bitcoin~~ bitcion core (BTC) trolls on this thread are all 3 month old accounts?

I use it to differentiate. I don't have any skin in this game.

Sorry? I think you are confused. Why should you call me a troll? What did i do?

Why would i lock up funds in order to receive a payment? I can receive payments now by just giving an address.  I don't get the complexity here.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Ok. I guess I'll just wait until it's ready.  I'm not that smart. But thanks for your help

woooaaah. you got me. I must be a troll. never posted here, ask a legit question. with ETH/ERC20 I just send my coin and it arrives.
TBH? I never actually bought any bitcoin other to pay for something.
I got into crypto with ETH, by mining a few. 
then traded for other ERC20 tokens.
This came up on my page and I asked a legit question, as truly, I never used bitcoin as a HODL project.
and now I am a troll. 
I heard about, but never investigated LN, however since BTC is down right now, I figured I would ask what it is finally. 
Still seems complicated to me, as I can use almost any other coin and spend it without opening channels and stuff. seemed very complicated to me.
Another dude explained it well, instead of name calling, and I get what he said. I can see the vision now.
Maybe instead of labelling people as trolls you could help us LN n00bs to understand?
you seem really hostile IMNSHO

@_date: 2018-05-09 22:48:50
I'm asking a legit question.  I don't understand why you are hating on me. What did i do to you?
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:56:21
