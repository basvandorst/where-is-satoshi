First one I’ve seen in Tucson.   I know a few people who have invested but not many here.

Ajo and park at that little liquor/deli shop.

I miss spring break in rocky Point.  Good times were had on those dunes

Yes.  Although I’m pretty sure dealers only accept stolen goods in Tucson, no real money.  Wouldn’t want to profit, just get high for free.

Oh that one

Nice.  I graduated from sahuarita high.  But yea I live in Florida.  Tucson’s not a “raise a family” type place, in my opinion at least.

Why not what?  Are you half or all the way full retarded.   I thought this story was interesting considering the multiple Craig Wright is not satoshi posts recently.  
Go trill somewhere else.

My thoughts almost exactly.  Mine may have been a little better with the grammar though.

And scammers love to out other scammers.

Saying this repeatedly won’t make it true man.  Play nice with them, maybe they send it back. You can try a lawyer and a demand letter, and potentially a lawsuit.  But it’ll cost you time and money. Would it be worth it potentially to lose?

The absolute worst.

Yea in the states it’s basically finders keepers.  That bag of cash is mine. Hopefully you can get your money back.
