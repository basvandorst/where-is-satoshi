Could someone please ELI5? I'm not sure what the implications of this would be. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 13:03:35
ok, but could you give me a best and worst case scenario?
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:20:54
Ok, then it sounds like your answer is "yes, it's possible, but in my opinion it would be superfluous."
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:23:52
Shit, that's a really good point. Do you think there's any way around that?
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:41:25
Thanks for your thoughtful response! That makes a lot of sense to me.  
I understand that it would be complicated, but why would it be more complicated than the software used by, say, coinbase? 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:24:03
Ok, so maybe the answer is "Maybe soon, but not now" (?) Is that what you're saying?

I tried to read up on the Bitcoin Foundation's voting system, but it was hard to tell if the system failed because of disorganization or because of the blockchain. 
I didn't experience that mess, but it seemed like the startup was disorganized and sent a bunch of confusing emails. 
Is it possible that another company could do a better job? Or do you think the problems are endemic to blockchain technology? 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:22:30


C'mon, that seems a little simplistic. We both know that wouldn't work. 
For me, the appealing feature of blockchain voting is that the security is embedded within the vote, not the hardware. So, your voting machines can be cheap, local adoption would be easy(ish) and it wouldn't matter if someone guesses that the password is  "ABCDE". 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:01:55
Sure, but there are plenty of places, such as [Russia and Uganda]( where voter fraud is common and many citizens have access to mobile devices. 
edit: I would imagine that a blockchain system of verifying votes could be a huge improvement over the current system of trusting local or national Russian officials. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:07:02
Thanks! I've finally figured out that it's easier (and cheaper) to fund my Mt. Gox account by purchasing bitcoins elsewhere and sending them to Mt. Gox. Avoids all those pesky fees. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:24:52
I sent from my coinbase to my mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 23:29:18
Yeah, that's exactly it. I went to purchase my first bitcoins, only to find that I couldn't because a thousand other people are trying the same thing. 
I was a little frustrated until I realized it was all my fault. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:44:58
Does anyone else think it's weird that shares in a company are being sold over a web forum? Basically all my alarm bells are going off. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 06:59:38
Thanks! Everyone on this subreddit seems pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:13:47
Don't know why you're replying to me. I'm as worried as you are, I just hope you're wrong. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 01:11:50
Thanks! That's so nice of you!
This is going to sound dumb, but I have no idea how to deposit your kind donation. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:39:02
I just saw your edit and I wanted to let you know that I empathize with you. 
Don't listen to the assholes on Reddit. 
The hive mind wants to classify you as stupid, so they can say that you're different and that this will never happen to them. It alleviates the cognitive dissonance of taking a risk on a cryptocurrency with no regulation and rampant thievery.  
I'm sorry you lost all that money. It sucks and I'm also sorry that Reddit is full of shitheads. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:17:46
Wait, I don't understand how a separate computer is safe from malware. Why is this safer? Can someone explain this to me like I'm five? 
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:41:40


Ah shit, is that going to happen? I really need to get my cash out of there. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:52:00
Ah, does anyone have a screencap of that deleted comment? 
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:09:43
Sorry, I'm not a finance guy. What's "prop money"?
@_date: 2013-07-02 22:35:54
God I hope not. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:51:31
Ah, reddit advice. "Have you read the sidebar?"
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:23:50
@_date: 2013-07-06 13:11:35
Yeah! Go Bruins! 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:55:04
I think Roman will be looking at a class action lawsuit if he doesn't get his act together. If that happens, please add my name to the list. I have screen captures of the money I can't access; I suggest you also start gathering evidence (if you haven't already). 
Edit: I hope everyone reading this is gathering evidence of the money in their accounts and any other legally pertinent information. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:50:30
Definitely. I have about $500 tied up, but I can't imagine what other people are going through. I'm just pissed off. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:53:46
You're an amazing person. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 01:20:27
Ah ok. That makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 01:19:00
Well it's not entirely sarcasm. I know I didn't personally cause these problems, but I'm still at fault as a member of the recent wave of new bitcoin users.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:53:24
Thanks, that's what I was afraid of. 
Do you have any experience with Mt. Gox's international banking transfers? Is it as bad as it seems? 
Once I get my money out, I'm definitely sticking with Coinbase and/or CampBX. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:43:08
Are there any good alternatives to coinbase? 
@_date: 2013-02-17 01:20:37
Wow, thanks! You're awesome!
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:27:04
No, I don't need it immediately. 
How does buying Silver with bitcoins work? I've never done that. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 13:12:15
I'm sorry, my comment seems rude now. I like your sign. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 17:05:17
Whoa, me too! Got a reimbursement of $5 less than my original transfer. 
What the fuck is the Internet Archive Refund? 
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:49:08
I haven't done this, but I feel like I'm gonna need more details. How does this work? What do I say to the teller? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:07:43
Thanks! For some reason I thought bitcoin transfers would be substantially faster. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 23:42:37
@_date: 2013-02-18 15:41:59
Thanks for the info. I just tried to make a cash purchase, but they asked me for my address and ID, which kind of creeped me out. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:26:06
Basically, bitcoins could be traded like a stock. 


As someone with a good amount of cash that's currently caught up in bitfloor limbo, I really really hope this goes through. 
It would open trading up to not just the main stream, but main streamer who have a lot of money. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 17:12:55
Thanks AudenX!
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:07:20
Thanks for the update. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 07:00:24
I'll do my best to keep demand high ;)
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:50:04
I'm glad to hear all that interesting information, but I could do without the radio jockey bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:26:26
I think that result remains to be seen. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:37:43
Oh wow, I'd be purchasing an actual chunk of silver. 
Any way to buy silver and then immediately sell it in USD?
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:22:11
That's part of what's worrying me, I can't find the transaction on blockchain.
