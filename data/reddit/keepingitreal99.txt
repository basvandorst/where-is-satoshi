That's a lot of work you did there.  
But still doesn't change the facts.

3 years ago is a long time.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:43:14
didn't take 30 seconds. I'm not slow like you.

That's the only criticism you need.  Because it is why it won't gain mass acceptance and the price rising doesn't affect that.  The market cap of BTC is miniscule.

I don't know or care what comment score is.
And why would I waste 30 seconds of my life googling sources for you?

You can slap a public and private key on anything. And could put the same keys on multiple items. You are missing the point, but I get some of them are too.

So this chick is an employee of Blockstream, from what I understand.

LOL...too funny and when the price tanks, going to come in here and rub it in really hard to you losers.
And I'm long right now but I hate arrogant longs.

Truism with loads of empirical data.

My statement remains correct, despite your desperate attempt to find flaw in it.  Like many Bitcoiners, you are desperate.

Most Trump supporters are below 90 IQ people, so they don't have the brain power to really understand Bitcoin....at least not in more than a rudimentary way.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:34:40
Didn't work out that way, did it?
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:34:25
Hope you just enjoyed losing 10% of your money.

By my calculaton they only added 25 new users in the last 4 days.

No one with a brain ever said there was a "tolerant left".  That's an oversimplification just made for Republican sub 90 IQ voters.
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:41:47
Of course.  People are stupid to think that the SEC cares about their comments at all.

If your friend bought US stock market index fund three years ago instead of Bitcoin, he would be a lot wealthier than you.
But dream about that rocket all you need to. It's most likely all you have.
