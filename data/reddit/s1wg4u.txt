yeah, fair point.
I've got 5 on BTC-e, but i'm just going to sit on it and see what happens.
Thanks for the advice!

Ah I see. Yes that's very scumbaggy. I'm actually worried about having my bank account tied to coinbase with all the issues they're having 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:08:17
Google "coin base instant deposit"
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:39:05
Other than buy coins that you already sold.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:37:06
How do I do that? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:37:27
That's absolutely nuts..... Are the prices always this drastic / different between the two places?
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:38:51
Yea, i guess you can't withdraw from Gox can you?

Strange. A month or two ago i made a deposit. It was for $100. THe price rose by like $50 / bitcoin so I thought i would end up with $150, but only had $100 and the amount of correlating bitcoin.

They lock in the cash value. Whatever your cash is worth in bitcoins when it goes through (not when you submit but when you get the money in your coinbase account) that's how many bitcoins you'd get. Or else they'd be losing money. Obviously.

So like a personal wallet to my computer?

Coinbase isn't instant. It's common to wait 5 days after purchase to get your coins if you aren't a level two verified member. 
Do you even read their instructions or did you just click buy right away?

Visit their homepage for more information.

Exactly. That's why I've decided to wait.
If BFL can back up their claims (which seem reasonable) then the current rate at which blocks are solved is going to be roughly 10 - 30 times faster when compared to the amt of $$ vs the hash rate.
This will of course shoot up the difficulty until it stabilizes again.
I remember reading (i think) that difficulty is calculated every 2 weeks. So if those new products are shipped at the right time, it seems like what you'd end up with are powerful products that now solve super fast for two weeks, which then floods the market wit hbit coins lowering the price for a short time until the market can re-stabilize itself with more difficulty and more demand.
So essentially (it seems like, again I could be wrong from my limited knowledge) one could buy a bunch of bit coins right after those units go into action, the market drops, and then once it stabilizes itself closer to its former price resell again.
I really don't know.  I'm more interested in investing money in the equipment and seeing where it takes off from there. But really I can't make any moves until both of those things (the new equipment) and the BTC/block halving take place.

Thanks :)

With ASIC coming out, that means that the profitability from GPU mining will drop tremendously considering the cost vs. performance that ASIC can give.
So, it seems like ASIC would be the way to go for investment purposes.
Does it seem like mining will be profitable if ASIC is used for a small operation? I'm not sure what the halving of the 50btc-per-block will do to the difficulty level or price.
Maybe I should wait it out until it halves, then invest in asic once the market has stabilized itself?
@_date: 2012-08-10 16:20:00
Thanks for the tip. Do you buy big coins? I'm not the best at economics. And I have $5 to $10k to invest in mining equipment. 
I also live in tennessee and currently only pay $.09c per kWh. 
My worry is that the price will drop twice with the two upcoming changes. 
@_date: 2012-08-11 07:38:50
Why doesn't difficulty affect price?
If the block reward reduces, I don't know if it necessarily means the value would go -up-. 
I think. It's all somewhat confusing, but I think there's differing views on how it will affect the price.
@_date: 2012-08-13 20:23:56
Interesting. Thanks for the post.
Do you think mining will remain profitable?  I can see it remaining profitable for some reason.
If I were to invest in a mini hub/tower right now, even at $15,000 it would only take 4 months to break even at the current difficulty level and current price.
That seems pretty profitable to me.
Now what I'm curious about is whether or not it's more profitable to mine solo or in a pool. I can't quite wrap my head around pool mining or come up with a solid calculator to determine how much I would potentially earn.
