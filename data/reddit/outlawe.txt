You learn more from trying and failing than from happenstance success or fear of taking a chance. If you stay in a safe little bubble, you’ll never grow.

If you let her die alone, you could’ve hodl’d and saved all the puppies in the world! 
But you did not. No, you did not. 
Because you hate puppies. 
Just look at how you wield your power over this one innocent animal. Can he sit? No. Can he run?  NO. can he solve even the most basic algebraic equation? 
And why?
Because someone wanted to  to play mother.

The first companies that will sell stock for bitcoin directly, and hold their bitcoin as an on the books asset are the companies I’m looking forward to investing in.

Any intelligent unbiased human who knows what is preached in most mosques around the world will agree that Islam as a faith has been hijacked, and will likely never recover.

Oh that is news for me. So a user with 2 factor authentication with coins on coinbase should feel fairly secure?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:58:35
Agreed. But until you solve the money thing you will have a hard time finding the energy and time to focus on what is important. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:37:00
I see. A little more than I think is fair. Coinbase better treat its customers right if there is ever a panic sell.

Even most of the fundamentalist muslim groups are ok with you being a Christian as long as you admit to being an inferior infidel and pay an extra tax. 
The groups who aren’t really muslim are the ones who will kill you.

I’m far from an expert in cryptocurrency security but the consensus seems to be a cold storage offline wallet is the most secure way to hold your coins. Online wallets are susceptible to hacking and keeping coins with a company like coinbase means you are not in direct control and they are not insured.

Perhaps the agreement has changed since I read the terms awhile back. It seemed pretty clear last time I checked that only dollars were insured by standard fdic 250k rules.

Well they better start hedging their dollars with some bitcoin or praying their grandkids reallllly appreciated those checks for $9.00 on their birthdays.

Nope. That is way too high. Even if you spread out purchases the fees are likely under 100

relating to the branch of biology that deals with the normal functions of living organisms and their parts.
"physiological research on the causes of violent behavior"
relating to the way in which a living organism or bodily part functions.
"slow down your body's physiological response to anger by breathing deeply"
So... maybe with proper deep breathing we can hit new highs!

Healthcare doesn’t have to cost a fortune. It is expensive because demand is exceeding supply and if the older generation maintain control of the economy, this trend will rapidly accelerate. The 25-40+ year old generation will have to decide how much of our income we will sacrifice to support our parents and grandparents. 
We all love our grandpa, but don’t forget the policies that have led to recent generations being poorly educated, overcharged for college and saddled with debt from wasteful wars to fuel the military industrial complex and grandpa’s retirement, social security, pension and yacht. Will you have a yacht? Does your job offer a pension? Will social security be around when you are older? 
Bitcoin puts more of the power of the economy in the worker’s hands. If bitcoin succeeds, the worker will have more of a say in what things cost.  (health care, retirement, assisted living, etc...)

The religion is not the problem. Having faith in a higher power is good for the soul, even if you believe that that power exists only in a sliver of your own being. 
The problem is the clerics/priests/imams who claim to know what god wants from you and for you. They choose to enforce suspect rules and punish the rule breakers. Usually this enforcement empowers the rule maker and disempowers the gift of “god” that exists in each individual.

I believe coinbase is only insured for US dollar assets. Coins are uninsured.

Lots of people joined Nicehash in august-October and they were due for an automated payout at .001 btc. A lot of users were due for that payout on Wednesday. The timing is very suspicious if anyone already wasn’t suspecting an inside job.

Says a guy who gave up on ibm literally the day before it popped 12% over 3 days. (He was so invested it didn’t matter because he owns too much of it to dump it like he probably wanted to.)
In all seriousness he is of course one of the greats. Knowing him as best I can as a young value investor he probably wouldn’t be buying bitcoin right now. He missed out on lots of great investments because of his discipline but obviously made out better than most. 
I think disciplined value investors are still mostly on the sidelines on bitcoin and definitely are steering clear of altcoins, but given the performance and political climate, it might be time to sniff around and maybe take a nibble.

What do you tell them when you missed out for now but you have influence? A certain “prince” comes to mind...

Am I wrong In thinking that I would be one mistake away from losing all of my bitcoin with a mistake?

I have faith in the dollar. It may take a percent or two but it will still hold most of its value and it is taken as currency around the world without question. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:31:50
Which coin is stable vs the dollar?

That’s a 2nd mistake, right? And still limited by protections even if I make both mistakes.

Refute me if you can. I haven’t heard a realistic argument yet.
