Smart guy. I don’t blame you for talking down bitcoin.
I do the same with stocks I like. I want the price to stay low for as long as possible so I can maximize my investment before the herd discovers it and drives the valuation up.

The value of a stock is based on return to investors? If I’m looking at a stock I’ll consider revenues, profit, dividends, assets, the likely future growth of the company, and quality of the management team. 
What metrics should I look at when I’m considering a purchase of bitcoin?

Oh man - I know someone whose family “invested” in beanie babies. They would stake out malls to buy multiples of “rare” beanie babies they were convinced would appreciate into a college and retirement fund. Now her parents still have a room full of junk they couldn’t give away but also can’t bear to part with.

You don’t care so hard that asking a simple Q about which metrics are used to value bitcoin triggers a “I don’t care what you think” response? 
Either you are a preteen or you have discovered an amazing investment case you don’t want to share. 
Well screw you Ben! I can see thru your ruse. I’m going to remortgage, buy bitcoin, and hold until the price is $1,000,000.

I was responding to someone who compared bitcoin to a stock - your reaction is revealing.

So you will will take the time to post “I don’t care” but not to share any insight? 
Here’s a tip kid - don’t invest on emotion.

That’s cool! Do you have info on how people in Zim access and use bitcoin?

That’s cool - I had heard of mobile payment systems like m-pesa in east Africa but I didn’t realize it has already extended to bitcoin.
