I did not know that, why is it that GDAX gets recommended over using Coinbase?

That's awesome, wasn't aware of that either!

Without going into much detail coinbase own the bitcoin that you hold in your coin base wallet because they own the private keys to the wallet. This is bad because if something happens to coinebase there goes your Bitcoin. You want a wallet that you own the keys to such as [electrum]( This puts you in charge of your own Bitcoin.

Yup that is what I ended up doing, it was actually kind of cool because it's the first time I sent a transaction. I've only read about the wait time for transactions and seeing the confirmations and experiencing it first hand was awesome.

Woah woah woah any specific prepaid card? I didn't know this was a thing, I just started buying and Coinbase won't verify my main card because it's from a small bank.

Look up MtGox, it'll reaffirm not leaving any coins in an exchange that you don't want to loose.

Rich is relative, if I had $20k I would consider myself rich. My struggle is I can only safely invest about $100 a month into bitcoin.

I would move them to your own wallet that you hold the private keys too.

When you say move it to a couple Wallets should I have multiple Wallets within electrum or should I move it to a complete different wallet
