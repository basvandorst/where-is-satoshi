Do you really use the Bitcoin blockchain? 
If yes: 
Does a transaction of one Barbadian Dollar require bitcoins with a corresponding value or are you just movings tokens with tiny symbolic values like 1 satoshi?
How many transactions per day do you expect?
How would this work on a blockchain with a capacity of &lt;500.000 transactions per day?

Of course you are right, there is no theoretical basis whatsoever to the modeling function, I found it by playing with the numbers. 
Its predictive power is probably very limited. How else could it be with something as complex and unpredictable as the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
Nevertheless it struck me how precisely this simple function  describes a lower bound on the transaction numbers in the past. 
A bit like observing planets and finding that they move on ellipses ...  ;-)

Question: 
What is your definition of a "moving bitcoin"?
Example: I have a bitcoin address with 50 BTC and I transfer 0.1 BTC to another address. 49.9 BTC will be sent back to me as change. Does this mean that 0.1 BTC have been moved (the actual value transfer) or do you consider all of the 50 BTC as moved?
According to my understanding, this corresponds to blockchain.info's distinction between "total output volume" and "estimated transaction volume", the former being roughly five times larger than the latter.
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:02:56
Let's say, you have X THash/s available and you use tokens T1 and T2.
You can e.g. assign 
0,5 * X THash/s to T1 and 0,5 * X THash to T2 (scenario 1)
or 
1,0 * X THash/s to T1 and 0 THash/s to T2 (scenario 2)
In the long run, both scenarios should yield the same result, but the second scenario is just easier to handle.
In the first scenario, you act as two independent miners with reduced powers. That you can do so has no particular advantages for you as a small miner. If you are a big miner, it means that you can still bring your, say, 15% hashing power to use by assigning 7,5% to T1 and 7,5% to T2. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:53:08
Not overly impressing, this growth (red dots = Sundays)
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:13:22


Why would this be required? I want to make it LESS efficient to concentrate hashing power beyond a certain threshold.
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:41:06
Yes, you are right, I overlooked that. 
Thanks for your mindful comments! 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:26:42
Hmm, nice idea.
But: When publishing a chain extension, a necessary condition should be that all blocks of this extension have been mined by the same pool. 
If you produce something like 1A/2A/3B/4A I will be able to see your cheating as you have combined pool A and B (mining tokens will be included in block as plaintext).
Would this prevent your attack?
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:55:05


Yes, no problem.


The mining token is part of the block hash (in addition to the nonce). Therefore, there is no way to share any results between these 6 pools and each pool competes on its own. If there was someone else running a 7th pool with 8.5% of the hashing power, this pool would have the same chance as any of the 6 pools to extend the blockchain.  
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:23:21
Good example. Let's first assume they have mined these 9 blocks with the same mining token. That would probably mean that they had assigned way too much hashing power to this token. With this token, they can only mine 1 block of the next 91 blocks, i.e. their hashing power would be essentially wasted.
Now let's suppose they have mined the blocks with different tokens T1 and T2, eg. T1/T1/T2/T1/T2/T2/T1/T1/T2. In that case, they had 2 sub-pools corresponding to T1 and T2. T1 = 5 blocks, T2 = 4 blocks.
That would still have been capacity overkill, as for T1 there would only remain 5 out of the next 91 blocks and for T2 6 out of the next 91 blocks. 
Please note: As the mining token is part of the block hash, it would not be possible to exchange hashes between sub-pools T1 and T2.
     
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:31:41
"In fact, [...] we find that much more of the traffic on the network is being dedicated solely to mixing coins!  What some people have reported as an increase in transaction volume is actually just the opposite.  It is a net decrease because a substantial percentage of the daily transactions are simply to mix coins."
How did you come to that conclusion?
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:50:14
Thanks, very interesting, I'm curious about your report!
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:46:02
Good point - I referred to that at the bottom of my post.
My assumption is that miners providing hashing power to a large mining pool would have to be assigned to a sub-pool. Now suppose that your mining rig is assigned to pool (=mining token) T1. 
If a malicious pool would run the above mentioned strategy, it would be necessary to periodically change the mining token on your rig. My assumption is that this cannot happen without your consent. Given the large number of members of mining pools, such a manipulation would quickly become evident.
Yet, it is still a technical possibility and if a single company controls 51% of the hashing power, that would be a feasible strategy.
 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:49:12
I am referring to this (citation from 
*Selfish miners achieve this goal by selectively revealing their mined blocks to
invalidate the honest miners' work. Approximately speaking, the selfish mining
pool keeps its mined blocks private, secretly bifurcating the blockchain and creating
a private branch. Meanwhile, the honest miners continue mining on the
shorter, public branch. Because the selfish miners command a relatively small
portion of the total mining power, their private branch will not remain ahead of
the public branch indefinitely. Consequently, selfish mining judiciously reveals
blocks from the private branch to the public, such that the honest miners will
switch to the recently revealed blocks, abandoning the shorter public branch.*
What I want to say is that when the private branch is revealed, all its blocks should belong to the same sub-pool, like in 1A/2A/3A.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:39:32
Let's look at step 4. When you broadcast your branch, it will either be like 
(n)A, (n+1)B, (n+2)B, (n+3)D, (n+4)A  
or 
(n)A, (n+1)A, (n+2)A, (n+3)A, (n+4)A
with (block number)token.
In the first case, I can see that several of your sub-pools (A, B, and D) have colluded. Such a branch should be rejected by the protocol.
The second case would imply that you can reassign your hashing power at will to any of your mining tokens to create a temporary power concentration of &gt;50%, otherwise you would not have managed to produce such a long branch. 
My assumption is that such a reassignment cannot be done without the consent of the owners of the mining rigs. The assignment of the mining token would take place as part of the registering process when joining the pool, it would remain constant thereafter. 
If you would run a sub-pool with ~50% right from the start, it would be an extremely costly thing as most of its hashing power would be wasted.
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:22:43
Not exactly, but comes pretty close. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:35:40
Let's say you run 10 sub-pools T1 ... T10, each with 5.1% of the network hashing power. All in all, you would control 51% of the hashing power.
One could imagine a setup where first T1 is secretly told (transfered) the successful hashes of T2 ... T10 and thus mines 10 blocks in a row. After that, T2 will obtain the successful hashes of T1, T3 ... T10 and mines 10 blocks in a row. And so on.
This attack is impossible, because hashes from different sub-pools (= different mining tokens) are incompatible.
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:33:52
You could a have as many tokens as you want. As you would try to find valid hashes it would probably be more efficient to concentrate all your hashing power to just one token. 
Yet nothing would prevent you from distributing your hashing power among several tokens, thus acting as several independent miners.
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:08:27


These miners would have different mining tokens. As these are part of their block hashes, miner A (30%) could not secretly transfer his block hashes to miner B (21%). A-hashes would be useless to B.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:05:02
In a realistic scenario (like GHash) the attack would require to manipulate previously assigned mining tokens on thousands of mining rigs. I don't see how this is possible without immediately chasing away the majority of the miners.
The extreme scenario of a single company with unlimited control of 51% of the hash power (like all the mining rigs with unlimited access rights in their own data center) does not seem realistic in the near future.
Yet you're right, I'm talking about risk mitigation, not risk exclusion.

You are comparing apples and oranges.
A Western Union transaction is moving a sum of money from source A to destination B.
A Bitcoin transaction can be much more complex.
Take this one as an example:
It is from a recent block (356716, see 
The Bitcoin transaction has 58 inputs and 11 outputs.
 
Western Union would need 58 + 11 = 69 transactions to create the same effect.

I have made a number of similar calculations of my own and I completely agree with the structure of your spreadsheet. 
As cdelargy points out, the number of bitcoins bound in exchanges, cold wallets, ETFs etc. seems way too low. The source that he cites (the jratcliff63367 post) is exactly the one that came to my mind, too. I would even expect &gt;85% of all bitcoins being used as store of value, i.e. &lt;15% available for transactions.
Also, I would definitely NOT expect this ratio of 85% to drop over time. Bitcoin should turn out to be the perfect store of value: its price is almost guaranteed to increase over the years, just like your model predicts.
What I am missing in your calculation are the following things:
- Lost coins, up to 30% (
- M2M traffic: In a couple of years, machines or autonomous agents will start to pay each other with bitcoins. Please note: Qualcomm is very well positioned in IoT chip technology and they hold a large stake in 21.com.
- B2B transactions: Businesses and banks will soon discover that Bitcoin can be used to efficiently organize worldwide value transfers. Once this starts on a large scale, the effect will be tremendous.
