could miners just agree to include a message in the blocks they mine?

I chose US Postal Money Order as my payment method; all that was required was my address. That being said, it's been 2 hours and still nothing... I guess I'll give localbitcoins a go

Not really. You just own the keys, which are used to spend those database entries by proving that some unspent outputs were addressed to you

The strategy only works if you're the USA, but it's basically this:
1. Sell the enemy weapons
2. Destroy the enemy
3. ???
4. Profit

What keeps people from coming into bitcoin? The 50 cent transaction fee is cheaper than withdrawing from an ATM or using PayPal. The confirmation time is still much faster than a wire transfer or even direct deposit. I don't see what the problem is.

If you're selling goods, Paypal charges a 2.9% transaction fee. There is also a fee for international transactions, plus the currency conversion rate fees.
Credit cards rewards are a joke if you take into account your annual membership fees and inflation.

I'm not trying to make this a segwit/BU debate, just curious why it's out of the question to have different cryptocurrencies for different use cases 
@_date: 2017-04-17 02:13:02
An alternative take is that large scale journalism will stop being taken seriously if they keep being wrong

bitcoin is *designed* to take and average of 10 min between block confirmations. For the average transaction to reach 6 confirmations, you need to give it at least an hour. Nobody ever claimed that transactions could be confirmed instantly, so why is a couple of hours such a big deal? What are your expectations?
@_date: 2017-04-17 01:06:24
I don't think there are many cases for such low amount transactions to the average person. For those who do, isn't that the reason why alternative blockchains such as Litecoin exist? I wouldn't take a train to go to the grocery store 2 blocks away from me when it's faster to walk.

You're comparing bitcoin to its past self in the early adopter stage. Predictably, more users means a more clogged network. It's only a matter of time until the technology catches up to user adoption.
I'm comparing bitcoin to other payment methods. Credit card transactions, wire transfers, etc. take days to get confirmed. If bitcoin is faster than any other competing payment system, what's the basis for complaining about 1~2 hours confirmation times?
@_date: 2017-04-17 02:17:14
That makes a lot of sense. It'll take time for people to understand the value of having different currencies for different uses. Are multi-currency wallets a thing yet? I can see how it would be intimidating for new users to have to keep track of multiple wallets

As long as it's a smaller fee than any alternative out there (eg. Paypal, credit cards...), free market forces say bitcoin is superior

If someone pulls coins from an exchange and into a CoinJoin transaction, the exchange/chain analysis company can easily tell that the user is actively trying to "go dark". So it may be in their best interest to flag these types of users for suspicious activity to stay in compliance with regulations. 
Is it possible to mitigate this risk, e.g. by making CoinJoin transactions look more like "normal" transactions?

Also, bitcoin offers clear advantages for remittances from the diaspora

I'm pretty sure we're on the same page here... Bitcoin combines greed and game theory to enable consensus aka "true democracy". Democracy doesnt mean communism or collectivism, just that the people decide how things should be run.

Oh so you're on the oligarchs' side. Got it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:16:40
Government is a failure because of greedy people like you. Democracy != Government. Bitcoin can take down the shitty government and get us closer to true democracy while doing so
