We still need to increase the blocksize somewhat Even if you consider these tier 2 solutions will work flawlessly because: An increased blocksize will make DoS more expensive and miners need adequate funding. Too restrictive of a blocksize could harm miner funding and make DoS easier (force out other transactions)

I think in order for lightning to be useful on the mainchain instead of on a sidechain, there will have to be a company that adjoins with a payment processor like bitcoin. These companies (which can be individuals) have a stash of bitcoin that they will trade with bitpay so bitpay can liquidate bitcoin on exchanges for USD. This will probably increase the % that users will have to pay (or merchants can absorb this cost). This is necessary because payment processors are still necessary and because you can't trade money that is locked in payment channels such as lightning on an exchange to liquidate for other assets (I don't think there will be atomic swaps from USD to lightning btc)

Only if you are prepared for the worst case scenario which is  an immediate retraction after such a fast runup. If you are comfortable holding and watching the price go up and down for that long you are fine. Otherwise be ready to support the next correction and be a smart trader.

One day you will be able to either purchase sidechain coins from an exchange that supports them and/or will be able to do "atomic swaps" with other chains.
Initially probably no.
In theory the side chain coins should have slightly less value than main chain because it is easy to move coins &gt; sidechain but harder to move sidechain &gt; mainchain but arbitrage will make the differense negligible. You can always just transfer back and forth without relying on an arbitrageur

Could you donate to charities that plan to spend btc into circulation rather than immediately dumping them through bitpay? Bitcoin needs to make a full cycle in the economy and none of these charities are helping to support bitcoin which got us here in the first place. 
As far as projects go what might be needed are bounties on certain tech that can bring us to the masses. If bounties are paid in btc rather than dollar then we are closer to making a full tech cycle.

He (correctly) doesn't subscribe to the intrinsic value paradigm as other gold people. But his reasoning seems contradictory throughout.
"all markets are manipulated"
"bitcoin is a fraud because its market is manipulated"
"bitcoin is used by criminal"
All money is used by criminals because it's a tool
"bitcoins energy consumption is too high and they won't let it go higher"
How high is the energy consumption for gold mining? Or the banks which bitcoin seeks to replace? If the cost of electricity goes up then consumption will go down for bitcoin.
"Bitcoin is the largest bubble ever"
It's kind of hard to say it is a bubble before institutional money is even here. Just wait until the REAL bubble comes.
"miners will sell back and forth to each other" 
Does he know that miners can't sell their newly minted coins right away? Why would  a miner sell to a miner instead of any other person? How would they do it on an exchange that doesn't have 0 fees unless he is arguing the exchange itself is compromised. If the exchange itself is compromised then why would he say "miner sells to miner" . Wouldn't he say "the exchange is matching parties who either know each other or are the same person and is secretly not charging them any fees to somehow increase their trading volumes" ?
"thats how much energy you need to mine bitcoin"
Actually there is no requirement for energy. That is why the difficulty can go up or down. If the price of energy went up the difficulty would go down because it would be less profitable to mine. It is a self correcting problem.
"At that point the miners have no incentive to mine. So who’s going to validate the blockchain? Are they going to charge a fee? Well fine, that sounds like Wells Fargo. That’s what banks do.  "
Looks like he doesn't understand how bitcoin works here. Fees are already charged and they will replace the subsidy as it diminishes. Charging a fee doesn't provide security. Proof of work does (which uses energy).
"bitcoin has never weathered a recession"
Ehh. that is what it was made for. You're skeptical that it's  use case is not viable? Bitcoin is already largely uncorrelated and investors look for that.
So the IRS will shut down bitcoin because of tax evasion? Will they also shut down the stock arket or literally anything else that can appreciate in value and whose investors don't declare gains and claim it is illegal because of tax evasion? Bitcoin could be a huge cash cow for the IRS. If it didn't exist then those profits wouldn't have existed either. Doesn't really think like a businessman does he? 
It's also kind of ironic that someone who is so into gold has such a love for the regulators when the market for gold is so clearly suppressed.

his math is definitely weird. "1 million coins up for grabs"  ehh. If 4 million are lost and 16 million are in circulation that means 12 million are up for grabs and 5 million more will be over the next 100 years. Of course the level of "deep storage" might affect your up for grabs calculation but I don't see how you come to 1 million
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:07:11
what are you sending from? If you use a wallet you can use custom fees with a decent wallet. A typical transaction is 225 bytes. There are historically more transactions after a assive bull run in the market like today (due to coins going to cold storage or exchanges or whatever) so there is more congestion that is normal.
If: You have coins on coinbase you can transfer them to another coinbase user for free using the email option.
There are about 30k transactions above 220 a byte. If each block can fit 3k transactions it would take 10 blocks to clear that out which would be 100 minutes. You could round that up to 2 hours. So if you paid 225 satoshi a byte you could reasonably get in a few hours. 225 x 225 = 50.6k satoshi . So that amounts to about $9 priority rate for a typical transaction in this peak period. BUt also note that this doesn't consider segwit. If: You were already using segwit and had your coins at a segwit address then that price would likely be cut in half so $4.50

Here is food for thought: The amount bitcoin increases between now and Dec 18th could be an indication of someone who intends to short bitcoin after futures begin by first acquiring a large amount of bitcoin and then selling it on exchanges while simultaneously "shorting" on futures. It would probably require a large amount of purchasing to run up the price. Hopefully we don't see any massive bull run before december 18 but a few thousand would be nice!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:23
the speed of blocks isn't linked to the price (but it does usually correlate with fees) . A higher price does soewhat indicate more users but a great *price movement* is a big indicator of a slowdown because there is usually a *behavior change* during large price swings of moving coins to and from cold storage. Weak hands to strong ones!

There are 3 things at play here: Bitmex has until Dec 31 to dump all their bcash. The bitcoin investent trust has about 50 more days to finish dumping their bitcoin cash.

I don't think any of it is valid. Take the very first and last part for instance.

"The top is hard to call. At some point, the urge to turn all those digital zeros into cars and iPhones will prove too great. Getting out of an illiquid asset—as this week, when exchanges struggled to cope with trading volumes—can be harder than getting into it"
That's silly. The exchanges were having trouble coping because of incredible *demand*. Volumes were off the charts. Bitcoin is getting more popular and some exchanges weren't used to the unprecedented demand and somehow that makes bitcoin an illiquid investment.
Bitcoin is growing so each of these articles that has some imaginary requirements for what it has to be or has to do is kind of funny. How can something be a unit of account before its volatility is small? How can somethings volatility be small when it is brand new and growing? 
The simple counter to most of these arguments is actually just common sense.

Gold industry uses more energy than bitcoin mining does. But that comparison doesn't even do the situation "justice"
Since bitcoin miners can move anywhere and they will gravitate to where energy is cheap and energy is cheap according to where it is produced in *excess* then even if gold industry and bitcoin were at 1:1 energy the net impact of bitcoin would be less because they would be utilizing more excess energy.
As paul sztorc (paraphrase) said, Bitcoin uses a lot of energy because energy is cheap to produce (Especially if it is produced in excess). If energy were more expensive miners would use less (since it would be less profitable). That means the energy issue is a self correcting problem. It will gravitate to excess and renewable cheap energy and if it ever does get larger and prices of energy go up the hash rate will be less and the network will consume less.

It will crash eventually. Worst case scenario is that it crashes immediately after you buy and we go into a bear market and it takes 2-3 years to get out. But this is  a long term investment and you have to be prepared for that.
Best case scenario is that you just bought at the bottom or even right before the biggest bubble the world has ever seen and you are in for a ride in which you will go very up and then down but the down is still way more than where you started.

The current high fee to get in the next block for a typical transaction is 9$. If you are willing to wait longer than 10 minutes and you optionally use a segwit address the fee can be much lower. Last I calculated it was about $1 for a segwit transaction within a few hours.
If you are using an exchange they typically charge high fees so they don't have to deal with support requests such as why your transaction isn't confirmed.
Also if you use coinbase and your friend uses coinbase you can do a transaction for free using the email option

The point of validating the rules is to know when miners misbehave. If they try to steal sidechain funds there is a lot of advance warning and it is very visible.
Miners don't have to change rules to "misbehave"
You can make it impossible for miners to steal sidechain funds by destroying them. The idea is that miners won't want to try to steal them because they know ultimately they won't get them and they will only succeed in hurting the sidechain which: Increases their tx fee revenue, increases their revenue from market "swaps" and increases the worth of BTC because it allows it to be \*any\* altcoin which helps bitcoin ensure triumph.

Too bad none of them are done right. If you buy and then immediately sell bitcoin through a "BATM" you would lose at least probably %30
Done right: The parts of the ATM should be minimal so the machine doesn't cost 10k and cause the owner to surcharge the customer, the ATM should preferably be linked to some decentralized exchange if possible, it should be done using entirely lightning or a sidechain (A weekly buy of $50) only makes sense if the transfer fees are low enough.

There is a demand from people who want to spend money they don't have. Obviously you can't lend something like bitcoin or a real asset for little to nothing because of the time cost. That's why banks won't die, because they literally create the money when they loan it so they undercut everyone. 
In theory they wouldn't survive because eventually people wouldn't want to accept inflationary money as payment so that would decrease the demand for dollars, but that won't happen either because the government uses force and the threat of force to legally require people to accept dollars.

In 1 more day RSK will be releasing which is a sidechains albeit in limited form. Tier 2 is up in us. Bitcoin scales with layers above it and sidechains. Btc are pegged 1:1 with sidechains. So this lemonade stand could accept a bunch of small transactions that used RSK tokens starting tomorrow. Later at some point they could send all their tokens back to the main chain for regular btc and only have 1 main chain transaction fee.

@_date: 2018-10-09 11:53:54
actually Paul sztorcs drivechain technology funds miners with sidechain tx fees too so it solves this problem
 One nifty feature of drivechains is that it captures those willing to pay a lot for a tx (on chain tx) and those who are willing to pay but much less (sidechain tx fees go to miners) . This creates an efficiency that a variable blocksize alone couldn't achieve for max revenue 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:42:05
In a recent tweet Adam Back endorsed drivechains as the next goal, but indicated that a "p2p sidechain" was the ultimate goal. Paul Storc indicated in a recent tweet that he doesn't think blockstream figured out how to do p2p sidechains.
It seems like blockstream is mostly attempting to go after the SWIFT network type use case with their liquid sidechain.

Itbit is a reputable exchange and also one of the regulated exchanges that will be used for the upcoming futures price index. They have a New york fiduciary license. I find them to be very secure. Their withdrawal process is different than some exchanges: You initiate a withdraw request and sometime later they batch their withdrawals together. This gives you time to cancel the request (if it wasn't you) . Always use 2nd factor authentication when using an exchange and use one that isn't tied to your phone number. Best wallet is probably just an offline generated paper wallet. If you get a fancy hardware wallet that is nice but you might be tempted to move your coins back to the exchange to sell them at some point. BTC should be looked at as a long term investment (2+ years minimum)
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:01:02
Even bitcoin doesn't have the same value across exchanges due to inefficiencies of arbitrage. Sidechains will be the same. They won't be exactly the value of a bitcoin.

Lightning can't work on a 1mb layer. It has to be on the second layer. Also Drivechain is what will keep bitcoin from breaking. Why? Because if all transactions simply moved to a lightning network then miners aren't rewarded for those transactions whereas with drivechain they get rewarded.

A big block chain can't scale as well as an ecosystem of sidechains built on bitcoin. Wait until December 4th when RSK launches and see how cheap the fees will be. Furthermore if you are just interested in cheap payments and some centralization is okay with you then why not use a superior tech like ripple?

Just my two cents: The coming futures market is based on Bitcoin not bitcoin cash. It takes time and regulatory work and history to get into wallstreet. Bitcoin has that and bitcoin cash doesn't. Also Wall street considers bitcoin a new "asset class". 
It's possible for just a few people to pump the price of bitcoin cash up high because some bought when it was extra low and miners hoarded it instead of selling when they mined it at insane rates (Jihan has some 50k or more). 
Bitcoin has all the monetary outlets that bitcoin cash doesn't: Many exchanges, manu USD trading pairs, many ATM's.
To the no2xers: Don't you wish you would have just said okay to 2MB? :)
final thought: What's funny is that core is in control here. They could issue a block size increase that came from themselves and it would decimate the BCH price. But odds are against it since they would rather "go down with the ship" so to speak than "sacrifice principles".

This is off topic. Also vitalik is an intellectual so of course he'd say that. How do you think law enforcement goes after pedophiles and traffickers without looking at CP or possessing it? Hint: they don't. CP at it's most basic level is evidence of a crime. Sure some people might get off on looking at evidence of a crime(including say a murder scene too) but it's dubious how making an unenforceable law like possession of a copy of evidence helps to reduce or eliminate the crime that took place.

The markets tend to burn people. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was selling some coins after the first initial high of $266
That being said it's also about what you are willing to lose. If there is a price at which you will feel forced to sell then you are almost guaranteed to lose... even if bitcoin hits 20k in the next year. That's because traders might simply drive the price down in a moment of fear and to eliminate long positions and weak hands.

Larger blocks can work with relay networks and guess who created bitcoins relay network? Matt Carullo and he is against too big blocks because of the weaknesses that these networks cam introduce if we rely upon them too much.

here is why I think bitcoin cash will crash eventually:
1. There are about 80 more days of Barry silberts fund selling off 180k Bitcoin cash. The higher the BCH price ratio gets the more sell off pressure this becomes even if it is at a steady rate.
2. There are many coins in cold storage that people don't bother taking out due to safety/ease. The higher BCH gets the more they might thing about getting more BTC.
3. The coming futures market is going to be based on BTC not BCH. There is already much inertia tied into BTC because these large funds and futures markets are locked into BTC
4. It would be bad for crypto as a whole if legacy bitcoin did flip. It would erode investors trust in crypto because everyone buying after August 1st would be tricked.

So from what I gather: There is a predicted 25% capacity increase from schnorr signatures but that doesn't include behavior changes. IF a large part of transactions are from exchanges and online wallets , they could aggregate and batch transactions during the day (which would lead to higher security btw) so that could increase capacity beyond the 25% right?

This is the new BS coming from because they can't figure out why bitcoin is so valuable 
CME announced futures start December and that is the prerequisite for Trillions to be pumped into bitcoin from Wall Street. Think the high price has anything to do with that?
Tether: Are an attempt to create a crypto that is tied to the value of 1 dollar to 1 tether. There are many trading pairs for tether to different crypto. Why would someone sell their crypto for a tether?
1: They want to hedge temporarily by moving to something that doesn't fluctuate on an exchange that doesn't actually have USD pairs
2: They want to use some oddball exchange with no banking because many main ones follow regulations and also report to tax agencies
If tether goes down then those holding tether will lose their value. It's possible the market could go down because some fear it would mean something like MT gox. Remember what happened on mt gox before it died? The price of a mt gox coin surged above 1k while the rest of the market was below that. Know why? Because the people with gox coins were trying to get out of gox. The same would happen with tether. Those with tether will try to get out of tether and buy all the crypto they can possibly buy.

Bcash can't become bitcoin.
Think about it for a second... Exchanges have been selling bitcoin for months already after August 1st fork. If by some metric they decided that bcash was now BTC they will have essentially defrauded their customers and sold them something that wasn't btc for months. Exchanges have undue influence on the name/branding. That is an entirely different scenario to the one where the fork could have gone S1x or S2x. THey wouldn't have defrauded their customers in that case since they would own both.

I'm not sure. They might have some preset amount they sell every day to mitigate the market impact. But it also might be wiser to dump it while it's hot. I'm sure someone from wall street would know. The higher the btc bch ratio is the more downpressure the coins will exert.

Is the method of "pegging" a bitcoin to an RSK side chain also known as an atomic cross chain trade? Thought they were different but I guess it makes sense they would be the same.

It doesn't make sense to me since all of it is done on software and you can't isolate software any more than it already is isolated. The CME guy said they are going to pause trading during rapid declines and inclines so by definition it can't go too far unless they simply can't control their own software for some reason.

The issue here is fungibility. With better fungibility you wouldn't know a coins history. Money is a tool and as such it can't be itself punished for what people do with it or else it becomes useless and the tool itself is punished. Eliminating money wouldn't prevent crime. Criminals would just resort to some medium of exchange that could take the place of money.
You could make the same argument against dollars to show that it wouldn't make sense. Does an assassin who is paid to kill someone in dollars make the banks and the federal reserve responsible for facilitating the tool that was used to make the value transfer?

I think that is the big concern about "centralization" . With proper decentralization you can mine anywhere so any government that tried to go to a miner and say: Hey, you must monitor all the transactions before you include them in your blocks and find out who previously spent them and what reasons they spent them and watch our blacklist and censor these transactions" ... if that happened the miners could move elsewhere or be eliminated from the network entirely and replaced with new hashrate. One reason why they bitcoiners are so afraid of the huge block data centers ALA bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:45:17
That could be fair but I think it overlooks a couple of things: The EDA BCH used was ingenius. It accomplished three things: 
It allowed miners in the know to mine it at ridiculous rates and acquire 125k + .
 It helped exacerbate bitcoin network congestion because of how it yo-yoed the miners incentives in bursts. 
It helped crash the price of it so that those in the know could buy it cheaper because of how faulty the EDA was and how it lead to an unreliable chain.  This allowed those with capital to buy large amounts of it and tie up circulation.
It was criticized by knowledgeable people. But it was actually ingenius at achieving those three things.
there is evidence some miners are paying themselves high fees in transactions on the bitcoin network (to perhaps throw off fee calculations) in addition to all of that. 
and it is apparent there were a ton of sock puppets / sybils en force inundating social media in a coordinated effort. (I know both sides use such tactics but it was obvious).
and lastly 50% of volume came from an asian exchange that could probably hide true volume.

Don't know. Some people sold initially at the first hint of the news (and some knew slightly before it was released) and the market steeply corrected after that. Looks like people are unphased.
People should be wary of holding tether because it relies on trust. You are trusting that it is backed with dollars. There is such a demand for something like tether that i'm not surprised it exists.

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:29:42
I said borderline for a reason... I expect miners to act rationally but you also have to account for the time frame. If a miner is doing something that is in the (1day) profibitability but damages bitcoin over a longer period then that line gets blurred to me. I'm not going to say they are hostile but they basically created a new coin, premined it, used an EDA that congested bitcoin on purpose and are now trying to get everyone to claim it is the real chain. That is pretty damn borderline.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:12:23
I think this is incorrect because most coins are being held in "deep storage" and haven't moved in a long time. This is public knowledge since the blockchain is a public ledger. There is a profit incentive of course, but for the people who believe in the fundamentals it isn't a "quick" one.
It is good to isolate criticisms of bitcoin to see if they hold weight. Any criticism of bitcoin that can also be levied against gold is essentially a criticism against a "store of value" which is an asset that is basically a hedge against the traditional monetary system.
Other criticisms of bitcoin are roundabout logic like: Bitcoin is too volatile to be useful. That's only true while it is growing and not successful. So you are assuming bitcoin won't be successful because it isn't currently successful.
Having a non confiscatable asset that can be sent in a borderless fashion to anywhere in the world with a multitude of versatile storage options and the programmatic aspect which brings layers of "use cases" on top of that is pretty hard to beat. It is simply better than gold at doing what gold does.

Here is a better rebuttal: Money is not a Source of funding. It is a method of funding.
"funded by bitcoin" is therefore incorrect. "Facilitated by the usage of bitcoin" would be more correct, but if it was facilitated with bitcoin why couldn't it have been facilitated by a traditional payment mechanism such as cash? The only reply you could give would be if 2 parties were unable to meet and therefore required a digital tool to connect them. But there are more and more digital ways to send money that doesn't involve crypto.
To make a final point: The only significant way to move a large amount of money into or out of bitcoin needs an exchange and exchanges are as regulated as banks are. If it isn't a significant amount of money then what's the point in targeting it in the first place?

 Make sure your funds are at a SW address
 Generate a paper segwit address for your friends. This will not only help you it will help them when they go to spend eventually
 wait for a low fee period like a weekend. Watch the mempool at bitcoinfees.earn.com and pay a low rate. You should be able to do it for $.25 cents
 Instead of 20-30 peopple you could achieve the same effect by halving the amount of people you give it to and doubling the amount $10 &gt; 20 and giving it at random or as a prize or some contest. That would be more meaningful to the people who received it and it would make the people who didn't receive it really think about what they missed and reduce your fees by half.
edit: Eventually in 2019 for instance we will have schnorr signatures and you will be able to simply aggregate all these transactions and do them in a "batch" for a much lower cost. One transaction can have many outputs so you could theoretically pay many people with the right wallet software.

most likely it will be too small a market for an exchange to bother enabling, but I can see that in the future you will probably be able to directly buy sidechain tokens which have roughly the same value as bitcoin.
So lets say there is a "big block" sidechain that enables a much higher througput for payments.
You will be able to go and exchange for this token and make many small payments and you don't even need lightning which is good because lightning isn't close enough to being ready. Hopefully some of the tokens will have USD pairs so someone buying bitcoin specifically for purchasing will be able to skip a good amount of transaction costs.

Here is what you don't understand: 
1 Bitcoin is on the cusp of some major layers built on top of it. One layer that you probably didn't know about is Segregated witness. Your funds need to be stored in an SW address and from there you can spend at a reduced rate. This helps.
2 wallet software still sucks at estimating fees. You have to do it manually for a while until they get better. Look at earn.com for current fees.
3 sidechains are merely weeks away. You will be able to transact *in bitcoin* on those chains with different rules and faster confirmations and more tx/s
4 lightning network(Lumino version) will be here within 6 months to help in addition to the above
5 the network was effectively attacked this weekend by the EDA of another coin that uses the same proof of work. They are fixing this EDA so there probably won't be a situation as unique as what we just recently had that lead to half the hashrate leaving momentarily resulting in blocks being found at a much slower rate which we are still recovering from.

That's their exact plan.


The Lumino network “is a Lightning-style network,” which Lerner described as “a Bitcoin soft-fork.” The network uses its own compression protocol, referred to as the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), according to its whitepaper. Lerner told news.Bitcoin.com in a previous interview that “LTCP scales Bitcoin 8.3 times, while Segwit only 1.8 times,” and he estimated that “the Lumino/LTCP/RSK/Bitcoin combo can serve 1 billion users.” 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:28:15
There are inefficiencies involved in arbitrage of a sidechain. You won't just be able to go btc &gt; sidechain &gt; BTC immediately with microsecond and at 0 cost in time or money. For these reasons it won't be the same price and arbitrage will narrow the gap as much as it possibly can.
For instance Drivechain is designed so that it is easy to go BTC &gt; sidechain but it is a long slow process to go Sidechain &gt; BTC . That should mean the sidechain token will have a close but lower value than BTC due to arbitrage

I remember reading something Paul sztorc that said something to this nature. It went like: A coin won't just be abandoned by an identical coin because it's cheaper and has more room to raise in value because it would be like eating itself and it would prove that the next coin couldn't rise in value because the same thing could happen to it.

I found this eyepiece on Amazon 
which means: You don't need to convert your bitcoin to another currency to buy it. Instead you use the purse.io site. Purse.io is a marketplace that links those with amazon credit/points and those with btc together. Those with BTC create an auction and list an item they want by linking a wishlist. They can change the discount on this item so they can typically get it for %15 under the value of the item because someone with the amazon credit/points/coins wants the BTC that badly. It will tell you your chances of success as you change the % of the auction. I had a few go through for 20% off and no issues

RSK is the first sidechain that will be launched on December 4th and it will be setup towards a smart contract system that competes directly with Ethereum (although you can just transact normally on it).
Since is the first release on main net bitcoin they will limit how much money can be sent to it for the first phase of production.
What many people don't realize is: SIdechains are practically here and lightning is far away so to speak. We will get scaling through sidechains before lightning and it is very likely that lightning will be integrated into sidechains rather than the base bitcoin layer because of how cheap transactions will be.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:37:52
Wouldn't best case scenario be an exchange like coinbase supporting a usd trading pair with a sidechain token to increase efficiency and eliminate the 1 transaction Bitcoin &gt; sidechain
So you would assume there is already a large pool of sidechain tokens available for purchase and people who wanted to "spend" could simply buy the token directly and never need to hit the blockchain. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:20:47
the full 21 million coins won't be created until finally 2140. Also it is estimated about 4 million are permanently lost. One thing some may not realize is that the recent price rise is most likely due to wall street starting to dip their toe in. As Novogratz recently said "the herd is coming" So if there are 16 million coins now and 4 million are lost that is about 12 million coins which would be 12 trillion at 1 million which wouldn't be too suprising since that would be 50% better than the gold market cap and bitcoin is probably better than gold at doing what gold does.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:37
Here is one thing I don't understand: (Correct me if I a wrong please ) . They say schnorr signatures has a 25% reduction . But isn't this VASTLY understimating the real world effects? If you can aggregate multiple transactions and do them in batches using less data then isn't this is not really possible to estimate exactly?
Lets give an example... one US exchange called itbit uses a different security model than coinbase. Any time you want to withdraw it initiates a withdraw request that is open until some time later when they process withdraws. that gives you a chance to let them know it wasn't you if it wasn't you. It also will allow them to batch a bunch of transactions together so that some efficiency could be gained with schnorr signatures.
The other part of my theory is that a large part of the transaction loads on bitcoin are companies that could be batching their transactions this way. Exchanges... etc
What do you think ?

Bitcoin is in a "perfect storm" so to speak that won't last much longer. The sudden pump of price of BCH and their difficulty means that the profitability of mining on BCH is for the moment better. This will be fixed later today when the difficulty is adjusted on BCH so that the miners aren't finding blocks super fast.
After that there may never be a situation again like we have today where most of the hash momentarily left.
Because bitcoins difficulty algorithm takes many blocks to adjust it means for the time being blocks are being found slower than every 10 minutes which helps lead to a backlog.
Coinbase also typically charges higher than whatever the market rate is because they can and because it leads to less support issues for them: customers wondering why their money is "stuck"
edit: Also interesting to note that BCH has 100k more coins than bitcoin does now because of the exploitation of the difficulty algorithm. This means some miners have hoards of those coins.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:10:48
Market is still recovering from the recent [hashrate Yo Yo]( Over 170k Transactions built up.
Also their software is probably not great yet for measuring an ideal fee rate so they just go with the highest charge to mitigate support costs (such as "why is my transaction stuck?")
They need: Better software, more customers to complain about the "fee settings" rather than the fees themselves to get smarter software. And a better day.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:11:18
There are about 5k transactions over 425 satoshi per byte and blocks typically have 2k transactions so if you pay 425 + satoshis you might get in 2-3 blocks from now which is usually 10 minutes per block on average but slower than that for the moment due to the quirky EDA of bitcoin cash

Bitcoin was meant as a way to be your own bank. So why ever go back to USD? If you need to buy something only for sale in USD then sure.
Couple good reasons to not go back to usd: fdic only insures 200k, rules are being rewritten to allow bail ins, guaranteed % loss through inflation, coming possible mandatory negative interest paid to banks which is spreading across the world. Then there is hyper inflation possibilities if USD lost reserve currency status and foreign dollars came back home. Finally failure of the government itself

People are impatient for the "scaling part" . Core is focused on making sure bitcoin survives. So not enough people were dedicated to Tier 2. Paul storc had to stop what he was doing with his prediction market concepts and hivemind/truthcoin and start building the tools he needed for his idea from the bottom up so he invented blind merge mining and drivechain.
What people don't realize is if a mere credit card competitor was the super bullish case for bitcoin there would have been a lot more people than 5 thrown at Tier 2 for the profits it could bring in. Now i'm not saying we can't eventually compete with credit cards but they are a "layer above banks" and right now we are competing with banks.
We are on the cusp of tier 2. Wall street has already locked in bitcoin as the golden coin. It is too late for other coins.

Rootstock launches December 4th. I expect a bullish reaction to that
CME futures launches December something. I expect that to be bullish.
Over the next 80 days there will be a continued liquidation of BCH by the bitcoin trust. A total of 175k~ will be sold. I think that will temper too much bullishness.
Transaction throughput should go to normalcy after tomorrow so while it won't bring fees down to sub $1 it should be more realistic.
 Also people might start using segwit more once they realize cheaper transactions?

It effectively subsidized miners with 100k easy coins because it allowed them to mine BCH at 100 blocks per hour validating no transactions while everyone dumped BCH.
My opinion: Bring back S2X. Why? It would decimate the price of BCH and it would also decimate Jihan and Rogers wallets. The futures market for S2x showed that the large block side was worth $1000~. Since S2x was called off it went into BCH... probably exactly as they hoped.
If S2x is called back on: It poses no threat to bitcoin since we know it's valued lower. It won't take the bitcoin name. It will hurt the BCH price. It will hurt roger and Jihans wallet. It will be more fair to all of the bitcoiners that bought after august 1st. Adam and all would still win their bet (S2x worth less than S1X( and it would force roger to pay millions. 
edit: And it would be a kick to the groin to the miners who decided to hoard it and also neglect the bitcoin network and let transactions accumulate while they sought out short term profits

Meet Joseph Stiglitz: The nobel prize winner for economics in 2001. His idea/model: "took into account asymmetries of information, which is another way of saying 'Some people know more than others.' " He is one of the Paul Krugman/Keynesian types 
and is considered the 4th most influential economist.
Here is an interesting article from 2007 where he claims the brand of socialism Hugo Chavez was using with high inflation would succeed. 
"However, Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2001, argued that relatively
high inflation isn't necessarily harmful to the economy."
Here are some pictures of the result of the high inflation and socialism that this mainstream economist praised
Bitcoin wasn't created because of a desire to subvert regulation. It was created to escape from people like Joseph Stiglitz who have a large influence on the lives of people through their idiotic ideas. Bitcoin is regulated. It is more transparent and regulated than any government in the world because it is regulated through math.
The people in cypress who had their money taken from the "bail-in" when their banks lost money from gambling deserve to have a way to store their money or at least part of their money that isn't reliant on the government and corrupt private corporations such as banks which are hell bent on increasing their own profits to the detriment of the general population. The venezuelans and zimbabweans deserve to have a way to not be destitute from the poor fiscal choices of their government and the hyperinflation that it brings. The chinese deserve to have a way to move some of their money out of their country in defiance of "capital controls". Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan all have negative interest rates through their banking system and their citizens deserve to have a way to store their money without it being double taxed through inflation + negative interest rates.

It isn't normal that over 50% of the hashrate suddenly leaves and the blocks become hard to find. One of the BU developers admitted that they designed their EDA to specifically incentivize miners with easy to mine/fast coins and to do it in a way that causes congestion on purpose 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:24:33
You're basically talking about push vs pull transactions. Subscriptions work because the merchant can pull transaction that pays your monthly fee. Bitcoin can't be pulled that way but a layer above it can. Imo that's a feature and makes bitcoin more versatile because the base layer is immutable and the payment info can't be reused.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:05:27
I would say it's a threat, but it can't possibly become bitcoin. Think about it for a second... Exchanges have been selling bitcoin for months already after August 1st fork. If by some metric they decided that bcash was now BTC they will have essentially defrauded their customers and sold them something that wasn't btc for months. Exchanges have undue influence on the name/branding. That is an entirely different scenario to the one where the fork could have gone S1x or S2x. THey wouldn't have defrauded their customers in that case since they would own both.

It sounds like the ATM is using some kind of wallet software that calculates the highest rate fee . These past 2 days have been a "perfect storm" of occurences that have lead to a severe backlog of transactions and high fees especially for the highest priority transactions. If you paid $19 in fees then it put you at the top of about 170k transactions which is why you got it fast.
My advice would be to wait until fees are reasonable (normally they are maybe 2-3$) and try a different ATM with better software or better yet use a real exchange (or local bitcoins trading)

When bitcoin cash forked on August 1st they chose an EDA (Emergency difficulty adjustment) that caused the difficulty to drop to a low amount which increased the profitability to miners temporarily while they mined coins on that chain super fast. That also caused a slow down on bitcoins network because some of the hash rate temporarily left since both coins use the same proof of work.
The EDA has caused miners of bitcoin cash to effectively have mined more than 100 thousand more coins in the same period as bitcoin. In other words there are now over 100k more coins in circulation on bitcoin cash. This effectively subsidized miners to keep temporarily taking hashrate away from bitcoin until the difficulty reset again and bitcoin returned to the most profitable coin. It also means the miners got away with hoards of coins that they mined at a super fast rate whilst validating almost no transactions. Jihan has 50k+ from what I have heard now.
So the other day bitcoin cash started gaining momentum because the Seg2x Fork was called off and that left nowhere for those who want larger blocks to go. This pushed the price upwards and that coincided with a period of low difficulty resulting in a large amount of hashrate leaving bitcoin. Because it takes a while for difficulty to reset, this lead to a backlog of transactions on the bitcoin chain.
Now the difficulty is back to normal on bitcoin cash and they are hard forking tomorrow I believe to fix it so this yo-yoing of hash power shouldn't happen again in the future.
Things to keep in mind:
* Most people and services still aren't using segwit which raises the amount of transactions that will fit in a block because it stores some of the data outside of blocks.
*there shouldn't be a sudden departure of hash anymore so things will be more predictable
*wall street is dipping their toe in bitcoin starting in December with a futures market
*Rootstock is launching december 4th. It will allow you to Peg your coins to a sidechain (1 transaction) and then from there make many transactions at low cost (up to 100 tx/s capacity to start with). 
*There is a fundamental difference in the philosophy of bitcoin and just simply increasing the size of blocks to fit more transactions. The idea is that the value itself should be a base layer that things should be built on top of rather than everything integrated together on the same layer.

I don't think his answer was very good about the "30 million hack" . People who don't understand might think it is somehow related to bitcoin. Only reason there was a price movement because of the tether hack is because of a perception that it contributes to the value of bitcoin (which may be deemed false by current market sentiment). Also Tether isn't a "trustless" cryptocurrency. You might as well be talking about dollars

Coinbase charges high fees because they can and because it results in less customer support for them since the transaction will be quicker and less likely to be stuck.
I've heard you can send for free if you move funds to gdax and then withdraw but I doubt that will last if it is true.
Best thing to do is to withdraw to a wallet and send funds to a segwit address during a slow period (Not within the next day) and use a wallet that lets you give a custom fee and try to base that fee looking at how many transactions are in the mempool.

They are trying to convey that BTC price is propped up by tether but:
Even if it was pumped up by a small fraction of its market cap it wouldn't apply to bitcoin alone. there are tons of trading pairs with tether. Therefore the "entire crytpo market" would be applicable here and yet they selectively target BTC
As nullc pointed out it is ironic that the more transparent you are the more criticism you get. Tether is actually a very transparent thing as it shows some level of fiat behind crypto.

I don't know if Jihan has all that power but one thing is for sure: The EDA of bitcoin cash was designed to let a minority of miners mine large amounts of coin. That chain has more than 100 thousand more coins in circulation than bitcoin has. Now those miners who have all those coins are trying to get others to call it the real bitcoin after stockpiling them for a couple months.
This makes me think that Jihan and them wanted segwit2 to fail all along. They were betting on BCH from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:04:04
hah 1/4th of all transactions are 1-10 satoshis per byte.
Here is what I wonder: Miners now have software that can tell them what is the most profitable chain to mine... but does that take into account the subsidy + trans fees? In other words the fees got so high 2 days ago that they almost started to pass the subsidy so that should throw off a calculation based just on the subsidy X coin price
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:55:54

With that said here is a thought: We are weeks away from wall street dipping their toe in bitcoin with a futures market in the second week of december. That also sets the precedence for an ETF later on. That's pretty bullish.
The futures market for segwit2x indicated that S1x was worth about 6500 ~ and S2x was about ~1500 . Currently it looks like the value of s2x went into BCH and the market is still sitting at those exact values.
But again don't take any advice. Best thing to do is look at BTC as a long term investment and forget about it for a while.

Coinbase is good if: You want to buy in a hurry to lock in a price and can't wait for a bank transfer: You can't get an account at a real exchange like itbit or Gemini or Gdax: Or you just want to buy small amounts
Coinbase isn't a real exchange... when you buy bitcoins they buy them for you with their money while they wait for your money to arrive. They own Gdax which is a real exchange. A real exchange you wire money to the exchange and you then setup a trade. Exchanges will also have lower fees.
You can simply wait to make a purchase on coinbase and it will lock in the price but you also are limited in amounts before you are verified completely and you pay higher fees than just using an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:56:25
I think futures opens up a lot more use cases... the ability to hedge the short term volatility of btc will make it really useful for previously unused applications.
BTW I had a couple of ideas you might throw in your speeches. Bear with me.
*1   Credit cards are a "layer above" banks and right now we are competing with banks. Eventually we can probably take on credit cards too
*2 Having the base layer of bitcoin be a higher fee system makes sense from an economic standpoint because: It allows miners to capture moreso what someone is actually willing to pay. By design 1million costs the same as 10$ to send so the fees are the same (aside from tx size). People have been struggling with a way to figure out how to fund miners the most because our subsidy declines over time. Having a higher fee base layer will cause "those willing to pay more" to pay more and miners will also get the other fees from something like Drivechain where the fees are much lower , but so theoretically are the amounts. That is something "just bigger blocks" can't do. You could try to do surge pricing with a dynamic blocksize but it can never quite capture that tiered effect. Make sense?
So Base layer: High fees &gt; miners
Side chain : Medium and lower fees &gt; miners (drivechain model)
Lightning on top of sidechain &gt; Really small fees &gt; users

Paradoxically bitcoin is too small to keep in an indefinite downward trajectory. You would need to raise the cap on btc very high before the truly big players can control the market.

My nano s doesn't estimate fees very well. You need to go to custo setting and enter the satshoshi amount per byte. Also you should be sending your coins to a "segwit address" so that it becomes cheaper to spend in the future from that address.
 provides a window into the current mempool to give the best estimate.
For instance I can tell just by looking there aren't many transactions above 200 satoshis per byte.
200 satoshis per byte for a typical size transaction of 226 byte  would be about 45,000 satoshi or $3   . If you aren't in a hurry you can try cheaper. If you had sent to a segwit address and are spending from a SW address it would be cheaper

I've thought about locking bitcoins for 100+ years and having them passed on in my Will to family members so they could pass them on to some future generation. If bitcoin is still here in 100 years you might be able to buy a small town with a single bitcoin.
But when it comes down to it you can't prevent locked bitcoins from being sold. Someone could still buy them they just won't pay as much due to the lock on them.

In my case I wouldn't have sold and it was only worth 800 or something at the time. That being said there are much sadder stories than mine :)

non-monetary transactions on top of bitcoin might not go away with higher fees. They might just simply crowd out more monetary transactions (which a smaller blocksize makes easier). Think before you speak next time

You realize that a tax subsidy does not mean taxpayers pay miners? It means they dont charge them as much tax.

Starting with LN... lightning has a scaling issue. The more money that is trying to be sent, the more channels are depleted/unable to route that payment. It will get better over time but it is no silver bullet to "scalability". 
  
The MimbleWimble guys are launching their own coin grin/beam
Confidential Transactions are "large" and therefore costly and not a good form of privacy
Drivechains are great except that some prominent(and dumb) people label them as "economic attacks" because they allow miners to earn revenue from layer 2 . So Drivechain is also launching another coin because of lack of interest and general stupidity.
"sidechains" are basically drivechains. There haven't been any other demonstrated ways at decentralizing the Peg to and from a sidechain.
Schnorr is the best chance for scalability and privacy in the near future for bitcoin since it not only allows but encourages "batching" and coinjoins to save on transaction size and add privacy. Peter Wuille said that we would see some sort of implementation in 2018 (I assume like on testnet). He also said that the first versions wouldn't include the feature where you can batch a bunch of transactions together and have just one signature. (Correct me on the details there)

One of the great things about the United States isn't its banking system. It was prosperous before that hideous thing (resembling the Bank of England) began. It's that through a system of \*checks and balances\* there was a check put on government power that helped to protect property and rights and foster a great nation. Bitcoin does this special thing by simply existing. It provides a \*check and balance\* to the power and dishonesty of banking systems, no matter their location. Bitcoin doesn't need to replace banks. Banks aren't going to disappear because of bitcoin. The world is just a little better now that we have a choice.

Not true either. A tax subsidy means there are different tax brackets so "everyone else pays more" is not true. Some might pay even less than the previous tax bracket. All subsidies are bad IMO, but at least a bitcoin subsidy actually makes sense for mining if bitcoin becomes an important part of the economy and the subsidy would be sort of a "national defense" . That's far into the future though.

Bitcoin has the capacity to surprise you in both directions. I could see a panic bottom of 3k this year. A 30k High would be possible I suppose if the bear market is recovered as fast as the one from early 2013.

How about they make it so that if an exchange colossally fucks up on pyrpose or by accudent they dont get legally rich as a result?

a 1$ satoshi = 100 million bitcoin so you're off. To answer the question: Yes it is enough. The quantity of bitcoin is essentially elastic because of divisibility and it doesn't affect total supply. A  fork could further divide bitcoins  more than they are currently.

This is a pretty poor article. I think you can't blame MIT since it is probably just this single author with no kind of peer review.
1. A "fedcoin" making bitcoin irrelevant is missing the point of bitcoin in that the issuance of bitcoin is trustless. It misses the entire point. 
2. The argument that facebook could use the spare cycles of their customers computers is about the same as saying a botnet could take over bitcoin. At this point, regular computation that doesn't involve an asic can't do much of anything.
3. Tons of tokens doesn't mean anything. It's always been possible. Why is someone going to store the bulk of their wealth in mcdonalds coin? They won't.

This is another example of why I don't like warren buffet. It isn't just that he is bashing bitcoin, but his logic isn't coherent. For example... according to his definition, gold is also gambling since gold produces nothing. And according to his definition, buying or "investing" in a business is okay because a business produces something. But that isn't necessarily true by his own definition is it? What if you invested in a business that mined bitcoin? Or mined gold? since it is a business it must be investing rather than gambling correct? But what if that business relies on the value of the underlying asset to be valuable? Is it now gambling again? What buffet is missing is that bitcoin serves a purpose... and if that purpose is useful then it has value.
Insurance is an example of a business that produces nothing yet is somehow useful to society and the members that participate in it. Yet investing in an insurance company wouldn't qualify as "gambling" to buffet since it is a company yet it produces nothing which does qualify as gambling. Contradictory.

Sure, btc goes in cycles, but it's possible we could have the  worst bear market this cycle. 3 reasons: rise of alts can present a drag on the price due to a lack of fiat pairs and investor confusion, the new ability to short the market can dampen it at least temporarily, the significant fork of 2017 can divide the community. People shoui ld take forking risks seriously which is why you want something that can prevent them lkke drivechain.

Actually, the plan isn't to withdraw before January 3rd, it's ON january 3rd. That's because the goal is to create a huge transaction backlog and also to somehow expose some sort of suspected fractional reserve scheme (Which even if were true could only work if the amount withdrawn was greater than % of reserves which is silly to even think about). For once I actually agree with Luke DASHJR
