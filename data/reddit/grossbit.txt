From what i see, the order flow is not processed in a fair manner. if the bid or ask is there, any body should be able to hit it.
a Market maker should not be seeing a new order and then decide, oh, after all im going to cancel my bid or my offer.
but it seems thats happening all the time.
I've been using Kraken for 3 months and its happening all the time.

some so-called blackpools platforms on stocks and other products have been inspected and some closed. There have been some fines here and there but its true so far the regulators are being outpaced by the tech changes to electronic markets.
that doesn't mean they will never look at things. they have also the mandate to prosecute up to 10 years after the facts...
i would be very very afraid if i was a market manipulator. This is a federal crime in US. called mail and wire fraud 
it can get you up to 30 years in prison and 1million usd fine. Kraken is based in Europe but does BTC USD and I'm sure they have some US based clients as well so surely they would be targetted by this law.

i encourage everyone of you to make movies when you trade with Kraken and please post here if you record something suspicious. thanks
@_date: 2016-04-28 05:53:53
to Kraken: 
i hope you read that, and that you are afraid, very afraid.
because i'm going to report that to the SEC, FSA and i hope some of you will do some jailtime as you deserve

ok i didnt know that Mr Jesse Powell is the CEO of Kraken, and i am flattered that he answered by himself.
I still have already reported my worries to ESMA, and in the little likelihood it gets any reception, i hope he will not be surprised.
If my suspicions are void of any truth, anyway there will be no pain on their side anyway, and its a normal thing for a business of being inspected from time to time by its regulator.
Still, if you've read Flash Boys from Michael Lewis or simply read the financial news, you know that those things happened, and keep happening in currency, bond or stock markets. Its a proven fact, and the regulators are several steps behind the cheaters. Thus it would not be surprising these kind of things happen in crypto world which is under LESS scrutiny
I agree that if nobody else has ever reported something fishy then a reasonable explanation should be that there is nothing fishy at all.
Then, not everybody may want to complain, or are even aware
When i go on the page  all trades are reported there with a timestamp. 
as you can see by yourself, in normal markets, there is typically 5 to 10 trades per minute, so one every 5 seconds, and the average trade size is quite small.
now i refresh the price, and it takes me like 2 seconds to input my order, can you explain why i am always unlucky when my order size is like 20-30 or 50 btc and im hitting deep in the order book. This never happened ONCE to me on Poloniex or BitFinex
i say this is not a coincidence.
my conclusion is either Kraken for its own benefit, frontruns client orders, or there is some kind of bug in the API, which gives privileged information to clever market makers who found the bug and use that information to their advantage, without Kraken being necessarily aware of it.
I don't have proof, but this has happened too many times to me, so that i believe its statistically significant and its worth reporting on a public forum and ask other users if they are experiencing the same thing, and a little inspection from the regulator can't be a bad thing
the best scenario is that Kraken is audited, they find nothing because they conduct business perfectly, and their reputation is enhanced, stamped by the ESMA.

Lets take my example again. its fine that if you put separate orders, and hit the 401 bid first, then the bot cancels its bid at 400.5.
what is NOT fine is that if you put a limit order to hit the order book, then the guy who is at 401, even if its the same guy at 400.5 has the option to know what size you are selling and decides to cancel his bid
im pretty sure that this is going on in Kraken
@_date: 2016-04-28 06:13:53
yes i agree, if it happens once or even twice, it could just be bad luck.
 i understand also that a bot may adjust its arbitrage bid. For example Bitfinex bid goes down from 443.23 usd to 443.21 usd, then assuming FX is the same, the bid on Kraken would go down from say 392.13 to 392.10 EUR. the size would be reduced if the next bid on BitFinex has reduced size.
but what i can tell you, is i watch BitFinex as well, the size on bids is not moving, or may even go up, and the bid could be moving to 443.25 usd as well, what happens is the bid on Kraken cancels. It avoids getting hit, i may only hit the lower bid, the higher bid often "escapes", like it knows that im going to hit lower anyway so he doesnt want to get filled.
but you can argue also that it should in principle happen both ways that bots adjust bid offers rapidly to moves in other markets. and seriously, BTC before yesterday was very calm, and this sh*t did still happen. so 50% of the time i should have a BETTER fill. Of course, it just NEVER happens
I can't prove anything someone should read their software code. but i'm going to record everything from now on, i'd like people to do the same, and when there is enough evidence, we can have a case. In the meanwhile, i will write a letter anyway to the regulator so they can have a look at it if they wish

of course trading is so easy when you can frontrun client orders.
