Because BCH wants different things, but uses the Bitcoin name.

You don't get to just "guarantee it". You have to eat one of your balls or soomething of equal importance if it doesn't happen. 
Here at r/bitcoin we hold a certain quality to predictions made.

Nice username and also nice comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:38:05
Can you give an example to an instance where this scenarion would serve one better than having cash and turning into bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:52
No I was sincere. And I dance too! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:37:43
That joke keeps being made with a lesser frequency each day. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:50:04
Ok. So you don't know the details and are deep into Ethereum, but you would sell your hypotetical btcs to buy bch and not Ethereum. 
Put yourself in my position, would you believe yourself for such a statement? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:19:01
Yea it is easy to post such a thing once you think you are in the clear...
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:27:31
Fair enough that really is a scenario where having it in btc would be more advantageous. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:06:17
Ops sorry wrong sub :D fixed it thanks mate
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:52
Completely agree, 
furthermore if it doesn't work, then we will have more grounds in explaining why scaling is not a long term solution.  What will BCC supporters say when we implement scaling? What will Ver say? What can they say? Nothing...
Stubbornness is both a curse and a gift for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:09:49
So you have been investing in altcoins but you don't know the BTC vs BCH situation? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:10:59
Meh... this is nothing compared to the ministry of religious affairs claiming dealing with bitcoin to be against the religion "so far". 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:19:01
No ketchup
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:15:28
What would you consider as dead? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:17:32
Ok then it would never die of course. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:02:07
I see. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:58:40
This post would probably reposted to r/btc to make fun of. However it was just a couple of days ago when they were claiming that they should infact  lose the name since bitcoin was dying. 
At the end of the day this is a political game as cringey as it sounds and no one part would do the "right" or "honorable" thing if it meant losing the high ground for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:21:39
was is before the time he was on bitcoins side? Would it make a difference? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:27:12
Ok this is no joke. Isn't r/btc different from r/bitcoin? I mean their topic is different right? What should I care about cencorship in some different subreddit?
Are you saying that there is cencorship also there? I don't use that sub so I really don't know. My only knowledge of that sub is from people talking about it in here.
Other than that, I must admit I guess my post is being a little sarcastic, but I didn't mean to insult anyone. I mean if I did I would just call them an asshole. But all is well, I apologise if what I wrote came across as insulting to the users of this sub.
And thanks for the suggestion. I'll head there and search a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:39:13
Stop it please you're embarrassing yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:10:15
Why the price drop tho if no one is selling? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:54:02
He will be using this money to pay for electricity and hardware won't he? I don't see how bitcoin would ease your distant uncle's black money problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:57:00
Thank you for sharing throwawaypornhub96.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:16:38
Who happen to speak perfect English... anyways man you are exactly right we are mostly war refugees seeking shelter and money. But the cocaine part is true tho.

In addition You didn't accidentally send Bach to any exchange so don't worry.

I have a question, when I scanned the barcode with my phone, it wrote: BtcLogaricmicRegressionLogAxisDONATIONv.10 and the donation amount was already written in it. 
How did you manage to embed a dnation amount and memo inside that adress?
Thanks 
Edit: thanks for the responses
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:18:27
Yeah... Hehehe Good thing we have this sub for intellectual honest bitcoin discussions. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:24:49
Isnt there anyone who just withdrew all the savings in Cash and waiting for things to clear? Between al the fud and misinfo that is what ı did :/. I'll buy again. In the meantime  ı use this opportunity to practice withdrawal etc. I'm fairly new so better to learn about this in the beginning rather than later... 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:12:58
But that doesn't address the question at hand. It applies to for example when to have a product that you produce with a mold. The single mold costs thousands of dollars but would be negligible when you produce thousands of products with it. But how does that apply to this scenario? Would twice the processing power cost less than the double of a single unit?  I too am curious about this situation. I think as the op it maybe that where electricity is cheap people create farms there. And then people who  live in the parts of the world where electricity is more expensive pay for this pool. 
Sudden shower thought: maybe all this may push the research of technology of renewable energy .. . 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:49:37
Dude, I'm really sorry for the responses you get. I think its not that people don't believe you but rather that they have no good answer to give to you. I mean if you were a troll then why not just give you a good counter argument and shut you up. Anyway for what it's worth this was a good question and I think u/Renben9 responded correctly thus informing the both of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:25:52
Ok. but wouldn't the price logically fall after people from altcoins go back? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:30:07
I am!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:17:44
I didn't use any other wallet so I am in no position to compare it. 
However bread meet my requirements pretty well.
It's very simple, and I use it for hodling purposes only so such a layout is enough for me. So if you are a filthy casual like me I would say it is the perfect choice. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:17:11
Yes. But he can buy toasters and sell them back too. I don't know much about money laundering aside from watching 5 seasons of The Wire, but I think the idea is that you don't make a traceable purchase of service or goods with that money. Paying for electricity and hardware seems pretty traceable to me. 
Again repeating myself, bitcoins doesn't give you an exclusive advantage for this situation. But I don't know. 
By the way just for the record I do suspect that this is a troll post. I'm replying nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:17:29
Damn man! You want to get banned?!
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:21:31
Jesus, answers here... why are people such dicks? This sub looks more and more like a cult each day. 
Anyways... I'm in no way an economist or knowledgeable in the situation but I saw something in a documentary once so maybe it may help you. It was about America's history. In the episode about the Great Depression it talked about a man who wanted to withdraw all his money from the bank. The bank didn't have that type of money in cash so it created a chain reaction and panic.  The documentary stated that that was the reason for the depression. 
So if we apply this to bitcoin I would guess that it's not the situation. You have equal amounts of bitcoins in your possession. Bitcoin is not represented by any other commodity. It's like gold. 1 bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin. 
Now please bear in mind that Whatisaid is not near the truth it's just me connecting some dots with little knowledge. But I hope it might be at least a reference point for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:26:35
What are you talking about? What subject? This is clearly a shitty propaganda flyer. And you are obviously on some kind of a bandwagon. 
Not that it matters, or I should prove myself, but I don't have any bitcoin cash, just BTC.
I understand that there are people like you and OP exist. I see it all the time in politics. But what baffles me is how the fuck you guys are not ridiculed to hell with this cult worshipping behaviour. (I mean your karma is on the negative but still) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:36:06
I thanks its about the day trader mentality. You can hold I the long run but when there is an almost sure movement like (after the fork there will be a drop) then I don't think it's cheating the hold mentality.

Tell me which part stated in u/oddrobotman 's comment is about the post being a lie. S/he is talking about something else. And I am sure you know exactly what it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:03:57
What is wrong with the original joke? I didn't get it...
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:54:26
Yeah me and my paid troll buddies are enjoying our yacht parties and free cocaine. It's a dream come true.

@_date: 2017-11-15 07:53:31
I mean you should be for acting stupid. 
You are insulting someone who is asking pretty straightforward questions. 
Do you think they are loaded? Just fucking answer him and shut him up, if you know the answer. 
What would someone who is new to crypto and wants to learn more about it comes to this sub and stumbles upon your post? Yeah... some good front you are putting. I swear I believe and hope that BTC will survive this. But it won't be thanks to assholes like you.
This coin is based upon a (imo) noble principle but we risk it going to trash when we systematically treat it like a religion and bash any suspicion. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:50:49
Well you might want to recheck that
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:29:23
Are you kidding? I love the memes. I think what I tried to say didn't come out as I intended. This is one of the subreddits I visit daily and is always fun. But I crave for more info which I think would be achieved by visiting multiple subreddits. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:00:31
It is risky yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:37:58
Easy there Bono... Everyone "must" do nothing. It's people's own money to decide what to do with. You are free to spend it anyway you like and others are free to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:16:17
To be fair we don't know the situation. This may be a user being a jerk as you said. Or something different. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:33:09
Ok I too am all for bashing Ver but please easy with the high explosives stuff. It's funny...
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:26:32
