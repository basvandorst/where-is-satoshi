Precaution about person scam and fraud in sale and buy. Do not sale with paypal company. The same not cover the seller in this transactions and you can losing Bitcoin and money both in the same time.  In the localbitcoins.com you too can fraud. You sale Bitcoin in secure Trade Exchange. The problem is withdraw is minimum for this and is possible after you sale do not can withdraw money. Please read political withdraw money you see option you have after sale bitcoin. Repeat PayPal is fraud and scam in sales all cryptocurrency repeat all cryptocurrency and is possible you losing with the company Bitcoin and money in the same time. If you more information about sale item with paypal you can call company and question about this and company tell you information. 
Thanks for you attention. And Lucky with you sale Bitcoin.

Paypal is a hypocritical company and currently in sales Bitcoin with Ebay and have been a victim of theft and fraud and then to sell and transfer to digital wallets purchases buyers have made me wait several days in company reclamam PayPal does not have authorized the purchase and PayPal them the money back and you lose your Bitcoin or Litecoin and money because PayPal says one seller as these sales are not covered by PayPal protection policy. 
This is known by all who have sold Bitcoin by Ebay and PayPal charging. They are a company that lend themselves to fraud and theft in sales Bitcoin. 
Many have been stolen using Paypal as an instrument of fraud on eBay. And send more evidence proving that person did speak with you on Ebay to buy Bitcoin and that person will have to write your Digital Wallet for Bitcoin transfer and Paypal will send evidence that you made the transfer Bitcoin Wallet to that address digital you said purchaser. They answer that PayPal does not cover you in protecting those sales regardless of the situation and will always return the money to the buyer and you lose everything. 
Ebay and Paypal hypocrites and opportunists after they have paid for theft and fraud Bitcoins now say they accept PayPal. 
I personally lost with PayPal and Ebay over $ 700.00USD for Ebay sales and I'll never use that company for its practice of theft and fraud sellers. 
NEVER sell virtual currency with them and they will lose their currencies and money.

I recommend not to sell Bitcoin exchange or Litecoin by Ebay. That company and PayPal are complicit in fraud sellers of virtual currencies. Buyers will pay by paypal and then you send Litecoin or Bitcoin to digital wallet to the buyer then the buyer opens a case in the resolution center Paypal option as not authorized that purchase and return all the money and you lose Bitcoin and money too. 
PayPal claims that there is always at its seller protection policy is not something about Bitcoin or Litecoin coins and so you can not recover the money, nor the buyer will return the Bitcoin. 
PayPal is a company that promotes theft and have to face when Ebay owns PayPal has recently expressed to begin working with Bitcoins. Having allowed the theft of a lot of money and Litecoin or Bitcoin vendors. 
If you have any doubt explained here can read sellers rules PayPal or call and ask, it is assumed that the customer service PayPal east and you will explain in detail. 
Be careful because you can lose your money with that company.

You can buy any virtual currency with PayPal on ebay and then claim you did not authorize this purchase when seller transferred the coins and keeps the money since it returned and coins. Whether Litecoin or Bitcoin. That did me several times and PayPal helped these people and stole money and coins. PayPal is a company with Ebay used to rob the sellers. If you want to steal coins can do shopping with PayPal and they say they do not cover those sales and you are not valid excuses and allow you to steal and become complicit in the fraud. They rob all sellers without distinction of persons and even if you send all the evidence do not accept and return the money to the buyer and one seller loses money and coins. That's the truth PayPal is a company that lends to steal and they admit.

Yes we think the system is continue manipulating in the different ( Forex ) in the value Bitcoin/USD, Litecoin/USD.  I writing staff ( Forex ) about situation but they see other side and not stop this practices. Is wrong and damage value both cryptocurrency for the free scam and fraud. You can see example in Twitter,  LitecoinPR include photos with log manipulating value. And is very worry that actitud of this people on the exchange trade, Bitcoin and Litecoin.  Repeat you can see example in log transactions when some people manipulating value for yours benefit not all free market. Its opinion and we think is real in this moment, with both crypto currency.

The company PayPal not cover transactions with Bitcoin,  Litecoin and other cryptocurrency.  The company always money back to buyer and seller losing cryptocurrency and money.  PayPal is a company for scam a fraud people seller.  I have different experience with them. And losing much money and cryptocurrency Litecoin example. I do not more business with the company PayPal after stole me in different ocasions. I not recomended that company. Is much better Skrill.com or Perfect Money but you can search the you better option.
