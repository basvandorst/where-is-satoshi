Took me quite a few years to get over this especially because i mined a few btc back then and forgot about it, now the mining site is offline and i have no idea what the name was. But whatever, the market has still potential to grow i just try to make the best out of it.

Yeah but the volume is pretty low, so you probably search for a buyer a few months if not longer.

Iam all in for crypto but in this case i think you are wrong. Its easier for someone to break into your home, hold your family hostage until you give em your private key than robbing your bank account. That is why you simply should keep your mouth shut about crypto with people you dont know and even your friends maybe because you cant be sure that they dont talk about it with other people.
