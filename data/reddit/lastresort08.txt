Voter apathy does absolutely nothing if the end game is to make change.

Gary Johnson said he does care about bitcoin a year ago in his AMA:


@_date: 2016-08-17 04:46:49
Compared to who?
If you think Trump or HRC is better, then it better be a joke, because that is fucking stupid. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 04:18:48
If there is one reason to actually think Gary Johnson is not doing everything he can to become the President, let me know. Otherwise, I have no idea what kind of argument you are making here. 
if a man is attempting to be the only hope for this country and putting his 100% into making that happen, then you have absolutely no reason to argue against people who support him for it. This country needs someone like him, and he will make a better POTUS than either of the shitheads. 
Yes the odds are always stacked against the honest politician, because he is surrounded by corruption, but hey, you can decide if you want to help him through that or if you want make another horrible decision like you do every single election - while expecting some miracle to happen without putting any work into it. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:49:34
He just needs to make to the stage, and that is very much possible. If you are a cynic about the world, I can understand that, but better kept to yourself. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:32:45
I am a person that always does consider other people's perspectives too, and so I can understand where you are coming from. 
But the issue is that we all have rational reasons for why we can't do this or that. Usually it isn't an equally valuable service such as creating a node, but rather it is more self-serving things. Also why not both? You can create a node and vote too. We have no idea where the future is going, and to put all our eggs in one basket - doesn't make much sense. So I still don't understand what would be a really unselfish reason why not voting is the right choice for someone. People who understand how corrupted these things are, should get out and vote, because currently, the people who have the most power are people who are rich and old (make up most voters).

No matter what your end goal is, you have to work with what you have right now, if you plan to achieve your end goal. Rejecting the present, because it isn't what you want, is counterproductive, since things will just stay how it is.
It's like saying "I wish I was stronger", but because you are weak now, you are simply refusing to do anything about it. That doesn't make sense to me personally. The first step to change is to be unhappy about the present - because its that dislike of the present that makes us go create the change. 


Of course it is corrupted. I followed the election tightly last time, and this time, and I know for sure that the elections are an illusion of choice, and that both parties are in it together. They have both showed a lot of corruption, and votes have been mishandled many times. This isn't even a matter of conspiracy anymore, but just what is the current state of things. It is bad, and the only thing I see as a hope is for a third party to rise from it. Third parties are not corrupted yet from everything I know, and seems to be only way to break the corruption (at least temporarily). 
I don't see voting as a time consuming task - it takes 30 minutes at most, and it is a support for people who are actually trying to fix things from within. They are still trying for it, and so I will support them, even if that's not what I place my biggest hope on. Do meaningful things for sure too, but help the good people that are also fighting this  through other means - even if you don't see much use of it.

I know there is no point in trying to reason with you, but here is Johnson's response in his AMA last year when he was asked about bitcoin:


It shouldn't be too ridiculous to think that he now supports Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:48:38


Trying to change something and failing to do so in 2012 is not "didn't do anything". You must not have a failure ever in your life if you are that clueless about it. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:42:37
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:19:03
Even for those who believe in bitcoin, this is a pathetic post. A made up situation to support bitcoin - as if there is no real reason to support it otherwise. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:30:46
I have a sub that was built around the ideas that you seem to be discussing here - I thought it would be helpful to bring like minded people together to share ideas, and discuss steps we could take as individuals on local and global level. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:17:10
Got any left? Never played it before. 
Trying anyways! :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:07:36
Do you have some left? I am interested and want to learn.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:10:47
Do come out and check out my sub it is basically the same idea. Let me know if you want to know more. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:14:06


Wrong. He believes that it shouldn't be mandatory, because people should make the choice. This is consistent with his idea of wanting a smaller government. It is sad you are getting upvoted for spreading misinformation. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:43:02
If you have any idea what happened last time or what is happening right now, you would understand. 
People are calling their senators and congressman, and people will be focusing on this issue as it is being voted on. The media is forced to cover and help in raising awareness of something that is important and requires the attention of citizens. This is a powerful move, and probably one of the few strongest actions he could take to resist this - as it would have otherwise passed without anyone noticing it as much. 
Your logic is similar to how people tried to downplay Snowden's actions by saying that he just wanted the attention. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:24:28
So am I :) It is the most sensible of all political parties. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:06:33
Frankly that has a lot to do with government helping them keep their monopoly. So it does make sense to think that keeping government out, would also fix the problem. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:55:26
He has done this before, even before he formally acknowledged that he was running for Presidency. 
However, if a candidate who is running for Presidency stands up for anything while it is time for campaigning, it can more easily be considered as a PR stunt than something else. 
For me it doesn't come as a surprise or simply as a PR stunt because Rand Paul does filibuster on matters that he considers important, and I would expect him to take a stand when he has spoken strongly about this subject before.

Bitcoin, Mesh networks, etc are all about giving more power to the people with decentralization. This picture captures the idea of people working together and standing up with each other, against the forces that are trying to limit and control them. It is certainly a beautiful thing. 
I actually even built a sub [that focuses on working towards this idea of the future, i.e. of people working together and standing up together. I sincerely believe this is how it will be, and to see it depicted in one picture, is truly inspiring and awesome!
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:46:14
And Gary Johnson from the Libertarian Party, or Jill Stein from the Green Party also got a chance to be heard. 
We can all dream...
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:59:08
The filibuster worked last time when he did for drones. I don't think it is for show when clearly many more Americans are hearing about the filibuster than they would have about the voting on the act. 
Now more people are going to call their senators and congressmen, and I hardly call that as "purely for show" unless you are so caught up in the party politics that you cannot see yourself supporting Rand even on a matter that he is right on. 
Your second sentence makes even less sense in terms of why we shouldn't care. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:25:28
Why do you suppose that? People putting the pressure on the senate and Congress has worked before. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:34:15
Genuine question... where is he now? Why isn't he filibustering too?
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:19:05
Please educate me on how war in the ME saves my freedom. I will wait for your enlightened perspective. /s

Do a simple Google search - 
Unless you are one of those CTR folks who will deny it regardless of the piling evidence. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:34:34
Nope. She is equally bad. Just because both are bad in different ways, doesn't mean you can't consider them equally bad as a choice for the President. 
In fact, there is good reason to worry that Clinton might even be worse, because someone who is corrupted and knows how to abuse the system is more likely to cause damage than a fool with no knowledge on how to abuse it. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:18:00
No, fuck you. 
The people who want to hate on wikileaks when truth is uncomfortable, need to gtfo. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:25:37
That's called Ad hominem fallacy. 
If you are seriously questioning whether one of the many secret acts of corruption is made-up, you can easily google it or look it up on wikileaks (which is even linked underneath each statement). 
So it really doesn't matter who made the site, as long as its factual, which it is. So, what's the problem?
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:21:22
Stating bad about Trump is like beating a dead horse. 
Clinton is the one that needs to be attacked, because she is equally bad, and yet her supporters are willfully ignorant. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:22:55
Wikileaks doesn't work that way. A lot of work goes in before these things get released. But let's make it about you. 
Nevertheless, who cares? Would you have preferred to get her elected and then know that she was a criminal? This is the best time since we can still avoid the catastrophe. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:32:09
Many of the leaks indicate that. Such as working with CNN, DNC, and even Republicans to tilt the odds towards winning. Also can't forget deleting evidence, rigging Palestine election, etc. Many [more here]( 
Not to mention violating a lot of laws either on purpose or due to incompetence, either of which make her a bad choice for President. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:00:30
Too many ads, and the captchas are indecipherable.
