In a way you really have to grasp how the monetary system works to understand why cryptos and Bitcoin work and are sorely needed. 
It's not hard to understand something when its open, trustless and transparent.

It's fun too

Btcdirect is well thought of to buy Bitcoin directly. Easiest is to register with an exchange in your country to withdraw to local fiat

I agree on all points. However the internet didn't have the internet to speed adoption.  Bitcoin does. 10-30 is more like 5-8

If your student loan debt is &lt;% rise of Bitcoin over the term of the loans then stay with Bitcoin. But who can say
That said, compounded interest on a 200,000$ loan at just 5% will result in you paying over $425,000 (+55% including initial capital) over the term of 15yrs. 
Paying off fixed debt is always smart. And the future value of Bitcoin is not set. 
Your money. Good luck

All fiat goes to 0 eventually. I believe since the inception of the Fed that the USD has devalued 96% from 1913 levels. 
Hmm.  Let's take a look over at the Bitcoin price for just 9yrs ;)

Inflation is a fallacy. In reality it is currency devaluation that looks like prices going up, in effect value goes down

Haha. 10yrs from now, when Reddit is dust, replaced by crypto chat network, phones are ancient memories, and BTC still rolls on into the future
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:26:31
Not mine but welcome.  Just a cute phrase; I could have got in the market at 2000$, but decided to sell out as it was early days in my trading, rather then just stay in.   When you've been trading for 5 yes I guess you can time better

Fiat devalues every day. Paying with fiat will eventually become a distant memory as we stop worrying about what Bitcoin or it's ancestors become, are worth because they will be the BASELINE for currency.

They tried to decentralize them so that if a tulipocalypse hit they weren't all in one place.

@_date: 2017-10-14 12:04:25
If you've just bought in now set a tight stop loss so as to preserve your profit and buy in at the next dip. BTC is expected to drop after fork, but then this is crypto and funnier things have happened. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:31:23

When you're dealing with massive amounts of money ($5mil on a 0.20c coin is immense) then you want to get maximum gain.  Even a 5c rise you'd be a huge loss on potential earnings I'd think.

 A VERY basic exchange here in South Africa locks withdrawals for 24hrs if you:
- change bank details
- change any account details like phone number or email address
- disable or enable 2FA 
- change account login credentials
Very good idea to have a block on any changes to prevent this stuff.

So what would have been an ideal fork? LN enabled with replay protection and asicboost disabled?  
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:09:21
Fiat is shit. Everyone with a basic education can see it.  
Forced devaluation,centralised manipulation, banks insider trading clients money to manipulate stocks and exchange rates. 
Banks here in South Africa were caught pre-buying forex when a large company like Anglo Gold would dump hundreds of millions for USD or ZAR, this making cents on the dollar before the clients 'order' hit at the top of the hour. 
Total shit. Rigged and manipulated

Temba, his arms wide
Well the value proposition is the core tenets of the philosophy of cryptographically secure currencies.  Anonymity (to some extent), near unbreakable security, and most important Peer to Peer exchange without governments or banks. 
The world is waking up to the like that is fiat and corruption and manipulation in the banking system. The Cryptos have it in them to wrestle the control of our lives away from the banks, who charge us to store and move OUR money around, and limit access based on arbitrary laws, and governments who tax our effort to give it to the central banks who enrich themselves. 
The possibilities of utility tokens is also near limitless. While not everything can be tokenised or blockchained, there are use cases which I am sure we have not even imagined yet.  
 
In terms of sociology this may be the greatest invention of all time, allowing people to manage their own lives and finance more effectively.  For the 2.5billion people outside the banking system (many of whom own a device capable of accessing the internet) this will be revolutionary in the way they receive money and do business. 
I'm excited, and also a little bit scared.  
What a time to be alive.
