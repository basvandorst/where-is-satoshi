No - more like worst case you lose all your money, best case you actually have enough money to buy a new home, car, or hookers and cocaine.
However, just like best case scenarios often don't happen, neither does the worst.

Maybe sending them an email letting them know the issue would help.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:25:43
Well that is what I'm referring to. That floor below 10K is what buyers are waiting for. Where is it, I don't know but It will be bought up once it stops. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:30:08
True, but you could have said that back at 19k.
You know how many people are salivating at the thought of btc dropping below 10k just absolutly ready to buy a metric shit ton?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:01:54
Which is why I preface by saying, "for people who believe in bitcoin/crypto." 
If you believe that bitcoin/crypto will be the future, then buying the dip no longer sounds "stupid".
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:12:47
Ah, i see lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:33
Oh trust me, no one should be doubting that it could very well hit 0 right now.
What I'm saying is that the moment people begin to see this climb, it will go back up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:42
That's not how this works.
Notice how the  main "technical difficulty" you're referring to is probably speed and fees. So you're saying once those things get resolved, it will skyrocket again? Maybe - I can see that.
However, what I've noticed is that the stock market and crytpo are not logical.
Did you see what happened to Tron when it got pumped? The fucking thing didn't even have a fucking WHITEPAPER and it went from .03 to .30 in a day with an entire new community saying what "it could be".
The moment BTC starts climbing back up - and it will - everyone will begin climbing on board. The world isn't logical. If it was, we probably wouldn't even be here in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:52:12
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:02:51
Well past performance can be used to have some sort of reference for future performance. Obviously it will never be 1:1 or it could very well all complete bullshit, but I think that history does have a tendency to repeat itself. 
Because human emotions tend to be very repeatable and fortunate for the wise, many people act on their emotions.
Lets wait till sentiments begin to change again... and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:46:11


It's a good thing that Bitcoin is planetary and not just for the United States.
How much is 13 trillion relative to all the money on planet earth? &lt;-- That is Bitcoin's question. 
To give you a round about answer, 13 trillion would be about 5% and we're currently not even close to that yet since were only at 160 billion which is .06%.... (not even 1% yet).
The U.S is just 1 tree (a very big tree) in a pretty massive forest.
Edit: I'm not saying it will reach those levels, but even if it reaches 1% means that buying today is a worthwhile investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:54:25
Exactly - Buy at 20,000 and sell at 8,000. 
Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:53:15
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:41
That's what I'm thinking.
Like "Who the hell is going to be the lucky SOB that buys at the lowest point right before it begins to skyrocket again?"
It's kinda funny because the lowest point could be at the price it is right now.

Nope - Inherent was precisely the word I was looking. They are both practically synonyms with one having connotations of deriving value **naturally** (inherent) and the other could be **acquired** (intrinsic).
Food has INHERENT value
Money has INTRINSIC value

You really should not give too much of a fuck about losing your money in this since you should only invest what you are willing to lose anyway. Yes, it can be scary, but if, and only if, you were 100% willing to lose that money and remind yourself of that fact, the fear starts to fade away. If you were not 100% willing to lose that money, then that is a problem.
When more start to hold, the more difficult it becomes for it to dip extremely low. At that point, there is only one way the price can go - up.

For people who believe that bitcoin/crypto will be the future, there is no such thing as a "bear" or "bull", only a market.
I'm looking at the 2014 market and thinking, "Damn, I wonder how much money those complete idiots who bought at $800 have today."
Who knows what tomorrow will hold.

Did you do 2 step authorization via sms or google authenticator? Coinbase now allows 2-step autherization through either SMS or Google authenticator (or both if i'm not mistaken). So check and see if maybe instead of a text message, you should be looking at the google authenticator app. Unless you never did the google authentication, in which case, you may want to contact their support team.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:05:12
nice try
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:56:46
Yeah, Ok.
Let me see an alt with 16 mill circulating supply hit $17,000.
But I do agree, a 30% pull back in alts and BTC going up again is all healthy for the cryptocurrency market overall. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:15:31
Yeah, I think most people would agree that the whole fractions thing has to go.
I was actually thinking about this more earlier today and felt the same way. 1 satoshi is far easier to comprehend. I see more and more people using that as a measurement.
This is almost necessary for mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:49:35
What if I told you that HODL simply means to hold and buy the dip because you believe it will go higher than the current price point or the previous all time high and that is a perfectly reasonable position to have?
What if I told you that any "real problems" bitcoin has is already being dealt with and the community is doing what it can to spread the word and get people/exchanges to recognize the solutions?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:40:08
I'd say volume in the game is very different.
What took years to get from $200 to $800 could now only take weeks to go from 10K back to 19k. 
All it takes is one announcement. Just one.

@_date: 2018-01-22 17:07:10
What if I told you people who analyze charts all day can wind up investing right when it's about to free fall or pull out right when it's about to sky rocket?
Nothing is 100% fact in this market, and therefore, if it is not a fact it is a belief - including speculation based on analytics. Granted, I DO BELIEVE that analyzing charts and trends are better than nothing, but I also KNOW that it is not full proof - not even close.
There are 2 types of investors: 
1. Analytical investors: Analyze charts and trends and invest based on patterns (often done by day and swing traders).
2. Fundamental investors: Look at the overarching theme and understand the technology/asset at hand and try to gauge at how this will or will not be adopted short/ long term (often done by Hodlers).  
Both of these strategies are fine and BOTH can lose or make a lot of money. No one knows shit so stop putting down either side. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:56:59
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:40:19
lol - I'm not confused at all. I think we are are simply looking at it from different perspectives.
The $ has value **because** we **give** it value. That is very different from something that has inherent value.
Food, for example, will always have value whether society believes  in it or not. You can not say the same about the dollar or any currency for that matter (at least for now).

I would NEVER buy anything related to cryptocurrency via ebay or any other third party. Only directly from the company.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:41:47
I agree with you for the most part.
I think that if someone has it set in their mind that they plan to hold for an x amount of time in which they believe their initial investment will have increased by y amount, it's fine. Whether that x amount of time is 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 year+ will determine the kind of strategy you should take on. 
Also, some people don't have the risk tolerance or, more importantly, the time to analyze charts. Yes, you can set stop losses or put in limit buy/sell orders and go about your day, however, if the price increases or decreases in a certain manner and you are not able to trade at the drop of a hat, you may run into some serious trouble. 
Yes, if you have a sound strategy, the potential to make more money than just holding is certainly their (also the potential to lose more money than just holding is their too) but I think many people simply don't want to take that additional risk or have the time to even venture into that space.
Edit: as for the gambling part - yes and no. I don't see it as gambling in the sense that you are playing in an environment that is designed for you to fail and if you win, you win big - obviously, that is not bitcoin or investing in general (maybe alt coin and penny stocks but that's besides the point). I'm more so referring to the odd nature of society/government to outright lose faith or dismiss something that makes perfect sense or accept something that make no sense at all. You just never know what the future may hold.

People are literally panic selling over news that is 2 months old.
Want to hear something more funny? December 6 was the day before we hit the all time high.
Now I'm not going to sit here and say it wont go lower, because it might, but I think people need to do research and then react on their findings.
All this dip tells us is that Bloomberg news continues to hold a lot of weight in crypto.

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:46
You think so? 
You know, for a long time I believed that the US dollar actually had some sort of inherent value. In fact, majority of  people believe in the US dollar even though it has literally no inherent value. We believe in it so much that even if a 100 articles are published explaining why the USD is actually shit, it would still only fall on deaf ears. 
And here we are - an entire world built around fiat currencies that people **believe** has utility when it actually doesn't.
I came to a realization a few years back working at an investment bank. The "truth" and "reality" are not always one in the same and what stands in between those two are our **beliefs**. Unfortunately, the current world doesn't **function** on logic or reasoning, which is where we would find truth. If it did, most of our budget would go to finding better sources of food, space exploration, and the education system. That is the truth but the reality we live in looks nothing like it.
So to your point - Believing in something does not make it true - it makes it a reality.
 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:57:39
Can anyone help me with this? 
Right now, people are selling because of a **rumor** that Tether is not backed by the USD and they will get exposed in court.
However, if they get taken to court and **news** gets out that they are actually legit (or that it all really doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things), then people will buy, right?
So how does the saying go again? Buy the what and sell the what?

well it went up from about 14,600 to 16,300 (gdax) in like 5 minutes at 6pm on the dot! Then went back down with the CBOE website crash.
All of this happened within about 5 min. What would have happened if it never crashed? no one knows :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:40
I made the same suggestion a while ago.  I'm sure it's been suggested before too. Not sure why it hasn't been done yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:40
So for a few weeks, everyone has been speculating which coin will be added to coinbase. Whatever coin it is will likely see a big jump in price because coinbase is the most popular cryptocurrancy exchange in the U.S. 
Yesterday, some fishy stuff started happening. In the morning, the SEC suspends Bitcoin trading for The Crytpo Company, which "offers a portfolio of digital assets, technologies, and consulting services to the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets"
This began a small bitcoin price drop because people began doubting bitcoin more due to the news.
Shortly after, Emil Oldenburg, the CTO and co-founder of bitcoin.com announces that he sold all his bitcoin for bcash. Everyone who knows who Emil is already knew he was a massive bcash supporter. Not to mention, bitcoin.com is not really a bitcoin fully supported website. It was created by those that lead bcash to basically have people think bcash is bitcoin and invest in bcash when they hear the hype about bitcoin. So people that know what's going on saw that Emil sold his coins and were like "eh, ok that's no surprise at all", but the masses read "bitcoin.com founder sell bitcoin for bcash" and go crazy and start selling bitcoin thinking it's about to tank.
So the price starts going down gradually after these two things go public. 
Then, coinbase comes out of left field "We are adding bcash to coinbase". 
Bitcoin price tanks to like 13 - 14k.
A lot of people start taking money out of bitcoin and moving it to bcash knowing bcash was about to  go up.
Clearly, all of this happening in nearly perfect sequential order is a clear sign of some shady shit going on behind the scenes.
However, coinbase kinda screwed the pooch. Long story short, their site glitched and people were simply buying bcash on coinbase without the ability to sell in time before they locked trading. So now, you have the price of bcash on every other exchange reflecting the correct price (~3K) while it's stuck at 9,500 on gdax!!
Now, whoever bought bcash during the hype is praying to sell at such an insane price. However, if it tanks before then, they could lose a shit load of money unless coinbases fixes all of this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:09
When I saw it drop like crazy, first thing I thought was, "if it survives this, even with the site going down for a bit, bitcoin will look strong as fuck." 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:04:07
That's almost like asking, "Why does Blockchain need a currency?"
There are benefits to both. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:47:45
How does it's main use not make sense? You might want to take a glance at the white paper.
I'm all for Bitcoin, but If IOTA delivers, it would be Bitcoin craze all over again. The funny thing is, I can actually see both of them succeeding since IOTA is not only trying to do P2P, it's aiming for M2M ecosystems which is beyond insane. 
As for the Microsoft thing, it was actually FUD and misinformation that spread because of some articles confusing the word "participants" with "partnership". Not to mention, Microsoft, not IOTA, was the company that used the word "partner" so people can't really fault IOTA for that one.
Multiple articles were published after about correcting this - here's one of them that clarifies a lot: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:12
oh I havn't head of the alt coin stuff, but that sounds very interesting.
Yeah, I honestly dont wish bad on anyone. I'm interested in seeing what's going to happen in the coming days.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:16:59
And that is exactly why IOTA exists - their technology doesn't need miners.
To put it differently, because the core technology behind IOTA is that every transaction confirms two previous transactions - everyone, in a way, becomes a miner. It's probably not the best analogy, but you get the point.
It goes without saying, because of this core implementation in their technology, all transactions have absolutely 0 fees since you yourself are doing the "work" just by doing a simple transaction. This would also allow you to do transactions in the pennies value since there wont be a fee that would be higher than the money you are sending (because there are no fees). 
Again, I'm just giving you the facts. It's still on IOTA to finish delivering this. However, from what I see, it's looking very promising.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:20:37
sooo, instead of HODL bitcoin, you're bitcoin will now HODL you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:50
I corrected the futures part in my comment - thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:46:48
" I think a few should not hold all the coins"
I feel the same way. Article today stated 40% of bitcoin is owned by just 1000 people....
That's kinda insane. More power to them, but 1000 owning 40% reminds me of the 1% of people own 50% of global wealth thing. 1000 people is nearly nothing %wise to the amount of people who own bitcoin, which makes it even more jarring. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:21
How did they resolve the issue? Just start it back at 3k?
What about the people that bought at 9k?
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:18:13
You are bugging if you think 9k can never happen again. You can get away with saying 20k (and even that I wouldn't say), but 9k? 
9k is very much possible.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:39:48
lmaoooo - this is amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:59
you are joking right?
First thing in the morning:
**SEC announces suspension of bitcoin futures trades... out of fucking nowhere...they HAD to know something was about to happen today**
Then after that: 
**one of bitcoin.com founders and known supporter of bcash says "I sold all by bit coins for bcash"... Price begins to go from 19k to 17k in a matter of hours. with a A LOT of bitcoin negativity on this sub**
LITERALLY A FEW HOURS LATER... 
**Coinbases announces bcash on coinbase and gadax.**
Dude this shit was planned. Could not be more obvious. 
**EDIT**: It was not futures suspension - it was the suspension of bitcoin for a firm by the SEC. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:24:34
They are.
Different as they may be, you still bugging.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:40:39
Well, I'd have to say the coin that is gunning for the top spot and claims to resolve many of the core blockchain issues, IOTA, will still be around.
Edit: and...here... we... go: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:40:47
was there anything in particular you did that your account got compromised?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:14:24
I dont understand why people are saying "nothing happened"
Did we not just see that $2000 price jump in 5 min on Gdax?!?! Then went back down by $1000 after the CBOE crash? What  would have happened if it didn't crash?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:32:04
In other words - it did indeed hit 19k for a few seconds, but for that day, it "closed" at around 17k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:42
That shit was VERY coordinated.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:09:30
ofcourse they dont give a shit, but you know who does think it matters? 
General public.
So if gen pop saw the site crash and got spooked, they sell - even if the website doesnt mean shit, it still impacted the market.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:49
Id imagine it did impact trading for people who believe that the site crash can impact trading.
Which ultimately affected trading, hence, that big price drop from 16,300 (gdax) when cboe crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:35:35
yup - it was in fact NOT futures. It was the suspension of trading by the SEC for a firm. I made the corrections in my original post.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:55:13
As awesome as I know he is, all he did was give a hypothetical situation and ran with it. 
I think it will take a lot more time before we hear an actual solution that will be applied to this problem.
Till then, we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:02:07
This is a big problem and other coins are already claiming to mitigate or even solve this issue at the foundation level of their technology. In other words, they wont need to figure out a way (and spend a shit load of money in the process) for something that is inherently resolved in their core technology.
Bitcoin needs to move fast and I'm happy to hear people bringing this up sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:12:05
Yes, it was was around that price for the past few days but went back up and immediately after the "sold all my bitcoin" news that shit drop from 19k.
Regardless, you are not going to sit there are tell me the SEC conveniently suspends futures today, bcash supporter says he sold his bitcoin, and the fucking coinbase says "we're adding bcash today"... ALL HAPPENING TODAY??
Dude, it's fucking insider trading point blank period. 
SEC probably caught wind earlier today and decided to jump ship while they figure shit out.

Not sure if this is related, but when coinbase was still showing 9500, people took their bcash from other exchanges (which were around 3-4k), transferred it to coinbase and then immediately took the money offline making a huge profit.
Coinbase obviously realized this and corrected the price. Now we wait to see what happens on gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:17:10
You're point? 
HODL can be just as correct or incorrect as the most well thought out prediction. If the price skyrockets, those who had the most well thought out ideas of the price falling will look like fools. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:24:10
Can you not?
Because you're going to cause the next bear market.
Edit: all jokes aside, if it hits 20k again, it will likely eventually break it. Double tops often get broken and tripple tops are practically none existant (which is why the idea of a "cup and handle" exists. It's basically a tripple top being broken. The reason this pattern actually makes sense is because when we do reach 20k again, we will come back down but people need to see how far low we go again. If we dont go anywhere near previous lows, people then decide "ok, i guess it really is valued around 20k" and then it breaks). So if you held through the bear market, why sell when its about to be a bull market again? Id sell during the start of the next bear market not at the start of the next bull market. But to each there own).
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:32:25
If it breaks 10k convincingly, it will likely retest the 20k eventually. My fear is what happens at 20k? I feel like it will likely break it but im very sure there will be a pretty huge drop once it touches it again. That drop will likely be massive but if bulls hold strong, should eventually break it convincingly. Once it does, it's game over. It will be all over the news again all around the world and the feenzy will be far crazier this time.

You know what I like about this experience?
All the naysayers in this very thread will vanish if btc hits 20k again.
Its a cycle
Those that dont believe mostly come out when it low.
Those that do believe mostly come out when its high. 
This is the very reason why i believe the price of btc is somewhat predictable - because human emotions are predictable.

bundled sub-prime mortgages involved outright fraud and they represented a much greater magnitude of investment than all cryptos put together, and that value was completely wiped off the economy, it required governments around the world to engage in quantitative easing and borrowing to cover the shortfall.
Yes, this is very true. However, crypto is attempting to do something far greater - literally attempting to **engulf the economy of money**... Think about that for a second. **Not** the things that money is used for (like houses for example)... It's attempting to engulf **MONEY ITSELF**. 
Will it ever succeed in doing that? Idk. We are obviously talking very long term, but this alone puts it on a completely different scale. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:53:03


That is true but it's entirely different as it pertains to a poor person trying to invest in the stock market currencies (which is extremely difficult because, like you said, they dont have money to start) vs investing just $50 into btc back in 2010 and now having a small fortune.
That second scenario is still possible because btc is deflationary. So now the poor have an actual way of entering the market and learning about investing and growing their money - something that was previously almost useless to them because they didn't even have enough money to do anything.
And you may say, "well real poor people don't have $50 to spare", that may be true, but at least you only needed $50 in btc rather than $50,000 in a stock. That is a huge game changer. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:38:00
IDK. To be honest, if Binance reverses the issue like they said, this might give people even more reassurance in the future. 
This was more so a win for Bianance more than anything. Sure the price is going down, but once people see "Holy shit, Bianance clutched it out", people a few days or even a week from today will look positively on their professionalism and godlike speed at resolving such an issue. 
Had this happened 5 years ago, those funds would have been gone. The fact that they are saying they can reverse this speaks volumes about Binance and crypto as a whole.

Last time I checked, a currency has not attempted adequately to become **the** global currency and even if it did, what nation would be ok with another nation's currency taking over? 
However, a cryptocurrency doesn't have to belong to anyone - so global superpowers don't have to worry about anyone 1-uping them (unless they are late to the race).


In the EU credit and debit cards are limited to charging 0.3% and 0.2% fees respectively. It would be a slight boost to the economy if transferring money was completely free but in no way would it be a revolution.
so above a very minor improvement in fees and speed (which its nowhere near actually reaching), what is left?

Why even have any system in place at all, right? Why not just remove all exchanges? Why not just allow for crime to go unpunished? After all, it's only natural.  Fuck it, let's remove all forms of government, make it a free for all. Every man for themselves!!!
You seem to have the concept of regulation a bit mistaken. Regulation is NOT a bad thing. Regulation from a centralized party, however, CAN be a bad thing and often is in many ways. What is being suggested is a way to reap the benefits of regulation WITHOUT centralization.
What if you were literally one of the brightest on planet earth and protected your coins with some top notch heavy duty security that makes it nearly impossible to hack you.... but you still got hacked because someone figured out a way to breach through all your security walls. You mean tell me you would reject an automated algorithmic regulatory system that would get you your coins back simply because "fuck regulations"? 
People seem to be more scared of the word "regulation" rather than the regulation itself.

Hats off to them. They were quick as hell and controlled everything fast.
If they do in fact reverse the issue as they said, which I'm inclined to believe they will, this will actually make Binance look strong as fuck.
It wasn't even a hack to their exchange - it was a compromise on the users giving away their information. This is why you should never input any of your account information without being 100% sure you are on the correct site and never give out any of your keys to any site.
Long story short - This was not Mt.Gox.... Not even close.
**EDIT**: CZ stated "Binance has reversed all irregular trades.  All deposit, trading and withdrawal are resumed.  will write a more detailed account of what happened shortly. Interestingly, the hackers lost coins during this attempt.  We will donate this to Binance Charity." 
Amazing.

@_date: 2018-02-02 16:43:41
Im inclined to agree, but there is a possibility that major governments decide to outright ban it.
**It wont go to zero then**. However, once the massess are not longer able to play, and it lasts years hovering at super low levels and people hodling realize it might just be over, the price will drop to near 0. That ofcourse would take ages to happen (maybe another decade after the ban). Will it go to absolute 0, no because very few will still be holding it but when people say "drop to 0", they should be refering to levels that are simply unrecoverable.
Whats the likelyhood of the above scenerio happening? Idk, but even tho its **far from probable**, its still possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:11:49
It's not magical - It just will just not impact the market as hard. If people see "30,000 BTC Sell Order" it will not cause the price to plunge immediately.

@_date: 2018-03-09 14:03:50
The benefit of otc (as it pertains to the price)  is that they can sell it to multiple people and that can decrease volatility in the market. Lets say 30k was sold to 30 people at different times. Even if all 30 wanted to sell, they wouldnt coordniate to sell at once since they wont even know eachother. Some may hold and some may sell, which is far better than a 30k dump on an exchange by one person.

Darn, I really didn't mean to put anyone down. I completely understand that $600 is a lot of money for many (including myself). 
If it helps, some have predicted the 8-7k levels for almost 2 months now, so this price point was very expected. Those same people now currently see BTC at about 30K by the end of the year.
Not saying that it's a guarantee up or down, but I'd recommend analyzing charts for yourself, following some good analyst, and then comparing your prediction to theirs. I've been learning and waiting for 8-7K for about 1 month and because I've prepared, this hasn't phased me in the slightest - unless it crashes and burns of course.
Good luck man.

@_date: 2018-03-08 19:15:37
Highkey, I want him to continue selling his coins on the exchange to buy the dip.
However, I'm almost certain he must have wised up by now and knows that he can find a way to sell off the counter to multiple people for a specific value rather than continue selling on the way down and lose a shit ton of money. This would make it much more difficult for the price to go down like it did before baring any black swan events.This is good news for anyone that already bought the previous dip and bad news for anyone expecting the price to go super low again. But who knows, right?

You'd be fooling yourself if you think the current downturn was not massively began by the Bcash and Coinbase fiasco. The price was well on its way to going above $20,000. The price then instantly dropped to nearly $11,000 (almost HALF in just a few days) when the incident happened. That alone shook many out. Then it went back but to about 16-17k before going right back down. The damage was already done.
Obviously, there are many reason why it's currently down, but a shit load of doubt and disbelief in BTC **for mainstream newcomers** came from that moment. This subreddit alone was flooded with people FUDing BTC hard and honestly some of them did present very reasonable questions and good arguments.
However, I believe that only made BTC stronger.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:51:57
No one is guaranteeing anything, it's just following a similar path. It could fail, but given the attention that big players are giving it, I'd lean more towards its success.

Does anyone remember what started the coinbase hate in the first place? It was the fact that they clogged up the network by not having segwitt.
They make mistakes, like anyone and I think, for what they've done for the community in attracting new people, they kinda deserve some slack- As long as it doesn't lead to a permanent loss of your money. If coinbase becomes one of the few exchanges to adopt segwitt, this would be a huge plus for the crypto community.

@_date: 2018-02-05 06:37:44
I've been thinking about that.
So from about $200 - $19,000, BTC gain a lot of attention and a lot of both weak and iron hands. The weak hands folded because their get rich quick dream popped and the price dropped to $8000.
If about $8000 is the bottom, then BTC gained  a lot of iron hands (people who won't sell and actually believe in the technology) between $200 - $8000. I'd say that's pretty damn fucking good.
Now, could you imagine what the next wave up would be like?... Absolutely mental.
Just a thought.

Neither was the internet - yet the same institutions I named above were heavily interested in the internet. You don't need to be a currency for these big bois to glance at you. However, when they DO glance, then you know you are on the right track. 
Segway, although some thought it would "revolutionize travel", was **never** even close to the same level as the discovery of electricity, establishment of railroads, or the creation of the internet (obviously). Only a few things ever reached a similar magnitude and Bitcoin is beginning to climb way up there - changing the way we think of money and the inter-connectivity of humanity. Segway, beanie babies, tulips etc. were never functioning on that level. 
So if it fails or not, no one knows. What we do know is that IF it fails, we go back to normal. However, IF it succeeds, it will change the entire planet as we know it.

Any and all transactions will require electric power (btc, Eth, ltc, IOTA, Chase quick-pay, any bank-wiring, etc.)
What you're saying is that If there are two computers and one costs $1 and the other $0, you would say the $0 is not free because you have to pay electricity to use it...
Well DUH.. No shit. both require electricity but one is clearly "free" in the same sense everyone always uses the word "free".
Once you own IOTA, it doesn't have any fees to make a transaction. BTC does have fees, as negligible as they may be.
It's that simple.
