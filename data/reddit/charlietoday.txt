At current exchange it would be about 10 BTC for a pilots license. Depending on your aptitude. Which country are you from?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:22:30
I'm on it, I need to get my web guy to do it. I'm pretty illiterate when it comes to editing our website.

I have 4.29141000 in my bitfloor account and would LOVE to help in efforts to get it back 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:13:22
I think I just did but it wasn't easy, I'm not sure the average person would be able to do that, the map editor isn't very user friendly.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:00:54
Around 24-30BTC for a commercial license and yes

Which license? Private? 1-3 months full time.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:38:34
The flight is around 45 mins, It sounds like the school near you is offering a pretty comparable deal. It's good value I recommend you check it out with them. Have Fun!

LOL the TSA would kill me for answering this question. Before you train I need to verify your US citizenship but it doesn't go beyond me looking at your passport and then endorsing your logbook to say that I've checked that your are a citizen.

Not yet, I'm going to get my guy on it first thing tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:36:45
Look up Vector Sport Aviation. Its run by a really great guy called David Bonnar I'm pretty sure he'd sell you a Sportcruiser for BTC

I'm not sure where you could park it, parking is a nightmare in Santa Monica. Getting a license takes between 1-4 months depending on how regularly you schedule lessons.

Nice! I didn't think I could be the first. Lets get a network together for flight schools that accept BTC, it seems that theres high demand!
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:14:51
Haha, well we'd be glad to welcome you back, who did you fly with? Do you remember his or her name?
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:33:09
We do offer Light Sport, in fact thats our speciality.

Helicopter ticket no, commercial license yes.
By the time BTC hits 10k I'll be on a beach somewhere...
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:30:25
I don't know what that is...
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:46:26
yeah not sure it worked.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:13:32
me too!
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:38:13
I'm afraid not, but there is a place in Camerillo that I think does
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:45:55
thanks :D
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:37:19
thanks. edit: Awesome just checked it out
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:26:30
Yes
