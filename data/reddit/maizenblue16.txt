Awesome, thanks for the info.

I haven't used it, and I appreciate the offer. I'm not looking to sell immediately, but do like the idea of learning more about GDAX.  Start by creating an account?

Doesn't look like I'm able to sell on Coinbase at the moment. Any idea when they expect to enable selling of BCH?

Makes sense, thank you.

I have an account with Coinbase.  They recently added ~1.5 BCH to my account; that is the amount of BTC I held on August 1. 
I have several questions:  is there any downside to selling all of this BCH ASAP?  Will it impact my BTC holdings?  Am I missing something or did they just add a lot of value to my account for no reason? What's the catch?

Helpful response, thank you!

Fair question. I think they'll be pumped about it, because it's just money after all. I wouldn't be in the slightest bit upset if they converted to USD and spent it. But I'd like to explain some basics and let them make the decision. 
I think it will also be an educational opportunity as they'll get into some technology they aren't familiar with and can being to learn about currencies and investments.

Perfect, thanks for the explanation.

Does it look like the different icons are moving with respect to each other to anyone else?

So the magic internet points could have some future value?
