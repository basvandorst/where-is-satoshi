ah thanks. I was trying to send XRP to bitstamp thinking they did the exchange but it seems that's not how Ripple works. Might have to do some reading into it.

Cool stuff.
Really interested to see how the engine compares to other exchanges when it goes live.

As long as your older backups contain the addresses (private keys) that currently hold your 19BTC you should be ok. I think...

There is no reason to stop anyone buying a load of coins. However if they did this in a relatively short amount of time the price would shoot up considerably. Look at the walls on bitcoinity charts.

It wouldn't be possible with the current design and programming in a change that would allow it would probably require a whole redesign of bitcoin which would probably result in a totally new currency.
What say I store my private key on paper and it is not stored anywhere else, without that pk those coins are never leaving that address. So no one apart from myself is ever going to have the ability to 'recover' the coins.
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:28:24

Bitcoins only have two states, existent and non existent. Once created the coins have no other status. Whether the coins are lost, stolen, in cold storage, etc can never really be proved, so implementing a system would allow certain people to make up the rules and essentially control Bitcoin to some extent. A bad idea.

Yeah I haven't seen anything about them disabling the mixer anywhere either. Even if you can access it from an older JS version such as the chrome extension, I would be a bit wary using it as the mixer might not actually be working, hence why it has been removed from the live site.

Ironically there was a post on here a while ago with a guy who had setup a few brain wallets with what he thought were relatively easy passphrases. It took a fair amount of time and quite a lot of clues for people to get the right phrases.

I think the best way might be to create a conf file which basically allows some of the parameters of Bitcoin-qt to be tweaked.
Under the 'addnode' section, add a new line such as 'addnode=IP' where IP is a well connected address from this list:
Remember don't put a # in front of the command otherwise it will ignore it :)
EDIT: Quick way to connect to a node is just to start bitcoin-qt from the cmd line with a statement such as 'bitcoin-qt -addnode=&lt;ip&gt;'
@_date: 2013-02-06 21:22:44
Did you ever make any backups from within the app, import/export option? If so that contains the private key in a different encoding.
Otherwise I'm not sure there is much you can do. I believe /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/ is only accessible as root? Therefore if your phone wasn't rooted then you probably wouldn't have backed this location up.

TBH I haven't really read many of the recent media articles and think in the long run they won't have much of an influence on newcomers. If a person reads one of these media FUDs then they will probably come away with a negative view but I find these days many people like to carry out their own research (with wikipedia, twitter etc) and form their own opinion about the subject.
For example I first became aware of bitcoin after all the doom and gloom from the $32 crash. I did my own research and I'm still here and think bitcoin is great even after all the negative press at the time.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:08:03
The app which you used last time I guess was the "Bitcoin Wallet". It used to be a bit heavy but now it uses bloom filtering with SPV etc so is much faster to sync. Probably the safest way to store your coins on your phone.
The other popular one is the Blockchain.info app which basically links to your online Blockchain.info account. There has been security issues with it recently however they may have now been fixed.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:23:25
I'm not for or against Litecoin really but there are a few points which make me question its future. 
First of all I don't really think it brings anything new to the table and even from a technical perspective its very similar. Opensource and competition is good and that but no one likes it when you pretty much ctrl+c ctrl+p most of the code and ideas.
Secondly you either love it or you hate it. The general vibe I get from the Bitcoin community is that Litecoin should get lost. In the Litecoin camp most of the time seems to be spent generating hype rather than actually creating things that can utilise Litecoins or differentiate the currency in some way etc.
It will be interesting to see how things pan out and I wonder what alt currencies will still be around/rehashed in the future.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:49:25
Haha yep, took me a minute to figure out what the post was about.
@_date: 2013-03-08 14:10:29
Haven't you heard, the miners are on strike from Satoshi Dice!
On a more sensible note, the current blocks seem to be up against their limit at the moment (250 - 500KB depending on pool) Maybe your transaction is just taking some time to get into a block. Give it a bit longer and see what happens, also look up the TXID on blockchain.info.
EDIT: Having looked up you address on blockchain.info, I can't seem to find any unconfirmed tx? Maybe your client needs a refresh?
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:35:21
Well you have all the bitcoins backed up, just no access to any of them :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:12:14

Yeah sorry, "full" is kind of the wrong word, what I meant was standalone client I guess. The android app is based off bitcoinj and uses SPV. I think there are some .net/silverlight ports out there somewhere which could be made to work on WP8. Anyway good luck with the app!

I agree, A new GUI would be great and would definitely appeal to new/novice users. I feel the current GUI looks a bit dated and could do with a few more stats just to let the user know whats going on etc.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:41:52
The only thing that I would possibly change with the current design is the way the block reward works. Instead of halving instantly every couple or so years it should gradually decrease block by block.
I think this would help keep the value of BTC more stable in the long term.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:17:47

Yeah I know about other wallet services etc blockchain.info seems to be the most popular though. Instawallet (3,393,625 wallets) isn't really accurate either I guess as each address is mapped to one wallet.
Was just wondering if the 500k - million users was an accurate guess.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:43:15
Both are different from the original post.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:59:17
Have a look at the TX on blockchain.info. That should give you a few ideas where your coins may have gone.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:25:01
People have only been burned buying and selling short term. If you plan on holding them I think you should be in a better position.

I've heard they maybe increasing their RAM to 4GB and upgrading to DSL from a dial-up connection...
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:21:32
So which is the correct version, the uncompressed or compressed?
Edit: ok so just read the uncompressed version is correct. But you are having problems importing it into Blockchain. Enter the PK into bitaddress.org "wallet details" tab to check if its valid. If so blockchain is probably being buggy.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:14:08
this, there is basically no chance you could mistype an address and someone else ends up with your coins.

Just out of interest why is there a soft block size currently at 250KB when the max block size supported by the system is 1MB?

I see it a bit like Linux distros. As Bitcoin is open source you are free to spin your own version. There are hundreds of Linux OSs but most of them are pretty much the same and only a handful of them are the most popular.
I see Bitcoin being equivalent with Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora being the pioneers and leaders etc.
Whereas I see Litecoin being just a copy with a few basic tweaks like Hannah Montana Linux:  haha
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:50:35
Yeah I agree.
It will be lower than 21 million coins though as people have and will still lose coins for whatever reason. Making it even rarer for the average person to own 1 BTC.

Sorry buddy, with the difficulty rising greatly due to the increasing amount of ASICs coming online the likelihood of gaining any shares with a mobile cpu is very very low. 
You would probably burn out the laptop and just waste money keeping the thing running.
If you want to give mining a go for a bit of fun I suggest you use your new PC to see how many shares you get. You can always turn it off or limit the processing power if you feel the mining is damaging your computer.

@_date: 2013-03-04 19:07:07
I think its a sound idea but with Bitcoin being an open system there are no rules that force you to do things in a certain standard way. You may have seen lots of different apps all using alternative Bitcoin logos for example.
That said if the idea is proved really effective I can see lots of "Bitcoin Acceptors" adopting this standardised styling .
@_date: 2013-02-20 17:57:47
I didn't realize lightweight apps such as the Android app downloaded the whole blockchain and threw away most of it to keep the size down. It always seemed fairly quick to sync even when resetting the blockchain compared to syncing bitcoin-qt.
But this should save a load of bandwidth, good for 3G/4G connections :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:33:40

You could also offer it on a USB memory key. It would then have a larger capacity (As a DVD wont be able to hold the entire blockchain for much longer), faster, more durable, easier to send via mail? and of course the USB key could be used for something else afterwards.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:33:17
I honestly don't know, tomorrow will be an interesting day for sure. The long term future of Bitcoin looks pretty good in my eyes.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:23:55
If you control 51% or higher of the total hash rate of the network you technically have the power to fork the network into two (or more?) separate chains. This means you could carry out double spend attacks and thus break some of the fundamentals of Bitcoin. It is therefore important that the hashing power is equally spread throughout the pools and individual miners so that this kind of attack is hard to achieve.
Even if BTC Guild does gain more than 51% of the network hash rate this doesn't necessarily mean they will carry out an attack but then it all comes down to trust. What happens if they are compromised and the attacker takes control of the pool etc.
This wiki probably explains it better than me :)

@_date: 2013-03-12 19:19:35
Yeah I thought so too. Didn't know the alert system existed before then.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:19:35
Considering the previous record was like 1k, 9k is a huge spike. I wonder if some post was on the front page of reddit or something, bringing in new users as the numbers died off pretty quickly afterwards. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:13:33
Ah thanks, so only the developers have the ability to make alerts to all the clients as they have access to a private key somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:39:23
One of the few people in the Bitcoin world who doesn't talk crap. Yay for Gavin!
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:48:32
Yep you can.
* Make sure you have python installed on Windows. 
* Then open a cmd prompt.
* Type "python pywallet.py -h" to get an idea how it works
An example to dump all the private keys out of the wallet would be:
"python pywallet.py --dumpwallet"
This should hopefully print out all keys with their corresponding private keys.

How many peers does it say you are connected to?
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:45:43
2500%... and people bought into that?
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:25:12
Cool, thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-10 16:58:23
I'm surprised ASIC isn't bigger, every other post seems to be people asking whether or not it is worth getting one.
@_date: 2013-02-20 13:27:49
I just tried a few combinations with the converter at brainwallet. Saw a 5 on the end of a string, thought it looked roughly the length of a private key, reversed the string and bingo! A bit of luck really.
In terms of time, around 5mins.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:01:15
What wallet program are you using, Bitcoin-Qt or an online one like Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2013-01-26 16:15:56
I can see this gem reaching a fair few BTC. Maybe in the double digits?
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:08:23
Ok, so first close bitcoin-qt. find your latest backup. Go to the bitcoin-qt directory, find the "wallet.dat" file. rename it "wallet2.dat or something, copy/paste ur backup wallet into the directory. Append .dat on the end if needed, so it becomes wallet.dat. Then reopen bitcoin-qt and see what happens. I can't guarantee this will work :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:48:00
Straight into the 90s then the fun begins :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:07:40
Yeah I would like the price to stay sub 90 but I think a lot of excited buyers will want to push the price to 100+ just to be part of Bitcoin history.
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:23:11
Yeah its missing from the live site and was asked about yesterday:
It still seems possible to access the anonymous option from an older JavaScript version such as the Chrome extension. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:20:24
Are you looking to us for support? :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:17:41
Scam or not, one thing is for certain that they are a fucking pathetic company.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:32:04
you password is all numbers? And you know 7 of the possible 13 digits? I don't think it would take that long actually.
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:35:42
If only I had a spare 1000BTC lying around :) GGG
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:48:35
Have you tried opening in a private/incognito tab? Maybe the old JS is being cached or something. I think the latest JS on the site has removed the mixer but older JS such as in the chrome extension would still have the option available. 
@_date: 2013-02-10 21:06:07
Probably full of "watch only" addresses.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:22:43
Exchange XRP for BTC with Bitstamp. What I did was go to bitstamp deposit, clicked on Ripple, then clicked on "send using ripple client", entered in some XRP. clicked send. Then it seemed to be returned to me.
I guess I did something wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:39:12
Shame indeed. Wonder how much it will affect bitstamp volume.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:17:26
How does it work, just tried sending xrp, then it appeared to be sent back to my ripple wallet?
@_date: 2013-02-16 17:01:28
I have seen a few of these 1 satoshi payments as well. If you have used your address with any free bitcoin sites it maybe coming from one of them. Well that's my theory anyway.
Here is a transaction with lots of 1 satoshi payments
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:08:17
Yeah sorry I'm on Linux so forget things work differently on other OSs.
I assume you are on Windows right?
* If so open up a cmd prompt
* type cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\' 
* press enter
* type 'bitcoin-qt -rescan'
* press enter
This should hopefully work 
@_date: 2013-03-01 11:58:30
What I don't get is how u value a Bitcoin. I know there will be a maximum of 21 million but how do we know that half of them haven't been "forgotten" already and its just the same few million cycling through the exchanges etc. Bitcoin days destroyed gives a bit of insight I guess but i'm still a little lost to how u value something if the total amount (in circulation) is somewhat unknown.
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:52:35
Wow, thanks for the in-depth analysis. I am a bit skeptical about the download numbers as like you said people may have downloaded it many times, I also wonder how many have downloaded it then given up as they thought it too long and got a blockchain.info wallet instead etc.
It will be interesting to compare the stats in a few months to work out a rough rate of growth.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:57:27
My balance on blockchain.info always seems to fluctuate every few minutes or whenever I click the reload button. I'm not sure where they pull their market data from but its all over the place half the time.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:51:17
Use Insta paper wallet next time
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:08:18
Have a look at this sub, there are a few different posts explaining how to get pounds into BTC/exchanges.
[@_date: 2013-04-05 21:53:09
If you have recently install bitcoin-qt I highly recommend you download the bootstrap file, this will be far faster than syncing from other nodes.
Once you client is synced you will see your coins in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:11:57
Wow just checked BTC Guild's mining pool share, 42%, that is much higher than when I previously looked. Slightly concerned about that but hopefully miners join other pools to balance out the share.

I'll buy you another yacht to go with your fleet when the time comes.

There seems to be an equilibrium formed from those who think it will rise and those who think it will fall hence why we are 90-100ish and why you are bored.
Some big players will probably make a move soon and then you may need to get your popcorn ready.
Just my 0.02btc
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:53:07
Hmm, risen pretty fast, bull trap?
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:55:44
Back in the early days, yes.

Thanks for the review/teardown and not just leaving it in a dark room hashing away never to be seen again :)
A few odd decisions with the PCB design and choice of components etc but at least its functional.
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:41:53
The public Bitcoin addresses you see in the blockchain, on the internet, etc are basically hashed versions of their private key counterpart. A hash is a one way function, so if given a hash code this will not enable you to know the original source ie private key.
Your private key should remain secret and stored only where you can get access to it. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:08:41
Gah! you tricked me :)
I'm not sure we will ever hear from Satoshi Nakamoto again. We will probably never know the answers to many questions people ask about the creator. Maybe the silence will be a good thing for Bitcoin as the mystery will remain intriguing to many people. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:52:03
0.01 does seem a little high now due to the booming price of BTC over the past month or so. However I have also seen 0.0005 being used as a common tx fee.
As you mention the fees are optional but you can also pay what your willing to get your tx into a block faster. Some very generous person recently placed around $4000 as a fee to get their tx to confirm very fast :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:42:31
I wouldn't speak too soon :)
