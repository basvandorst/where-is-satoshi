The problem with this line of thinking is that even if he's right, the fact that prices could be so easily influenced by a few headlines is itself pretty damning. Its a pretty strong indication that prices are influenced far more by speculation than by inherent value.

This is the correct answer people. Countries with healthy currencies are countries that have total control over their own currency. Neither the euro or btc is good for that.

the board of governers is determined by direct appointment by the president, so yes, you really do elect them, just as much as you elect the secretary of state or supreme court justices. 
And there is a huge difference between the parties when it comes to monetary policy. Namely that the democrats defer to the experts and the republicans are wrong about everything.

Satoshi has easily enough bitcoins by himself to completely destory the price of bitcoin. He effectively has infinite bitcoins in the sense that he could crash the price just as effectively as if he had an infinite number.
As long as Im forced to trust someone, Id rather it be a government I have a vote in over a private dude who doesnt owe anything to anyone.

The one dude being Bastiat, who died in 1850. The events that have ocurred since then have tought us a lot about economics. He missed out on everything we learned from the great depression and the world wars and stagflation and everything since then.
You're talking as if you lived in Bastiats time period along with him. The whole thing about different schools of economics is very outdated. Modern economics has incorporated all the good ideas from all the old schools and because of this the mainstream modern school of thought is generally reffered to as neoclassical synthesis, as in the synthesis of all the good ideas from the different old schools. 
The US government does NOT ever print money to pay debts, so your point there is nonsene. Also, inlfation is not a tax because the government collects nothing. Inflation, by itself, is only a change in prices of goods. It tells you nothing else on its own.
The broken window fallacy literally only concerns the national budget, so you brought it up when you brought that up. The federal reserve isnt capable of committing the fallacy because they dont make our budgets. Which part of that arent you understanding?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:27:01
i mean thats close enough for most people. do you think the supreme court should be elected directly as well?
lol broken window fallacy was just an argument made by one dude who lacked the perspective weve all gained from the hundred and seventy years of economic history weve been able to study since he died, it doesnt hold any weight in real economics. Real economics has come to the consensus that the only situation where the broken window fallacy actually makes sense is that it does accurately describe why wars fought on home soil are not economically productive. Beyond that, its nonsense. Furthermore, even if you think it holds up all of the time, its only about how the government spends money, it literally has nothing to do with monetary policy, so youre not even using the term right.
The federal reserve doesnt create our budget, congress does that. Maybe learn how things work before shitting on them next time.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:41:23
WWII proved by itself that wars do in fact generate economic growth as long as they arent on home soil. If the broken window fallacy had any merit, then the US economy should have shrunk as a result of the war. It obviously didnt.
The freshwater saltwater dvide doesnt even exist anymore, and even the wikipedia page talks about how the both sides of the dichotomy have been incorporated into neoclassical synthesis. Same thing goes for keynesianism and austrianism. Hell, Milton Freidman said "we are all keynesians now" back in the 70s, so your thinking is literally decades out of date. Calling yourself a keynesian economist in the modern day would be like calling yourself a newtonian physicist.
I still dont understand what point youre trying to make about inflation. Its still not a tax.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:40:56
Nonsense. Inflation only means prices of goods are going up. By itself, it doesnt tell you anything else about the economic situation. If everyone is prosperous, then you would expect to see people buying things and prices rising. A healthy rate of inflation is almost always a sign of a healthy economy. Deflation is a sign that lots of people are being laid off. Almost all deflation occurs during recessions and depressions.

Unless every bitcoin wallet is going to be insured by the FDIC for up to 250k, then no it really is not going to do that.

Of course he would convert it to dollars. What the fuck would a political campaign do with bitcoin in the first place?

Do you even understand what the broken window argument is? The argument is that *all* government spending harms the economy because it somehow crowds out private spending. Either way, whether you think the war or the new deal was responsible for the recovery, either situation proves the broken window argument wrong. If the broken window argument had merit, both the new deal AND WWII should have been bad for our economy. 
And yes, thats exactly what I'm saying regarding keynesianism. Talking about things in terms of keyunesianism vs austrianism or in terms of any other schools of economics is out of date precisely because we are all keynesians in some ways and none of us are in other ways. And again, that is because modern economics has incorporated the good ideas and tossed the bad ideas from all the old schools.

WTF are you talking about? You do realize that the federal reserve isnt the same thing as "the feds", and that the federal reserve doesnt arrest or prosecute anyone, and that this story has nothing to do with the federal reserve, right?
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:55:44
Yeah, but I cant make my own currency that is separate from but exactly like the dollar in every way. I could totally do that with bitcoin though. What happens ~~if~~ when someone simply invents a better crypto? There would be nothing stopping everyone from leaving bitcoin and it would crash.
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:49:32
Yes i believe that. Stability is a fundemental tenant of currency. Your suggestion requires that people have the majority of their wealth stored in a different currency at all times. If thats how youre using it, then its not even a currency anymore, its just a payment platform.
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:58:00
The whole "early stage" excuse is getting a bit old. At this rate, itll by obsolete by the time it becomes useful. Also, you never addressed my point about how its appeal to investors will descrease as the price becomes more stable.
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:18:15
Well his reasons are wrong, but his conclusion isnt. Bitcoin is doa because its not stable enough to be a useful currency. The other problem is that as it becomes more stable, the demand created by people who are using bitcoin as an investment in stead of a currency will evaporate, causing the price to drop.
The great irony of it all is that people love bitcoin because theyre scared of inflation with fiat currency, but the price of bitcoin will eventually reflect a currency that's undergoing constant mild inflation.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:50:08
So how long is bitcoin allowed to be "experimental" before people can reasonably expect it to be a serviceable store of value? Because if bitcoin wants to be taken seriously, it has to reach that point in a reasonable time frame, and it's already been in existence for a while now.
