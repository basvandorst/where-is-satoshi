The assets need to become money at some point though, because if they don't dirty money stays dirty. In this case Ulbritch just helped to exchange some dirty assets (drugs) for other assets (bitcoins).

I don't know, there are many of the strongest Bitcoin supporters and early adopters are libertarians or ancaps. It wouldn't surprise me if Satoshi was one of them.

Your mixing an increase of value of the currency with inflation, completely different things.

Hodling in the way up is easy. The problem is when the price starts falling. The hodl meme started in the midst of one of the worst correction, not at the top of the bubble. You are hodling wrong.

WARNING: You restored the wallet within the last 24 hours. If you FORCE CLOSE the channel you may risk losing all your bitcoin. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO PROCEED?
-Yes, I'm aware I can lose all my bitcoins.

I'm just saying that it may make sense to put your money in risky assets when you are young. Not saying that you will make 10x for sure. You may lose everything, but hey, you'll be making 7k a month in a few years, so you shouldn't care.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:09:17
Nah, the problem is that they buy high, a correction comes, they believe the FUD and sell low. 
99.9% shouldn't be trading. Buy and hold has been an excellent strategy for Bitcoin for most of its existence. Trying to get alpha by timing the market is risky.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:01:52
Unless you can afford to lose it, which I assume he can. 
If he had put everything in bitcoin a year ago he'd have 70k.
You can just look at it as inter-time diversification. Put everything into bitcoin when you are young, and put it in boring shit when you are older.

I really really don't think so. Even if all the 50M were profits they would only pay  taxes of around 12.5M (25% in Korea). So a 50M "loss" results only on a 12.5M tax evasion

The price only lasted above 1k for a few days, and  highest it got was around 1.3k.
The likelihood that most of them sold near the top is very very low.

What? Decentralization it's the best way to stop manipulation. Bitcoin is being manipulated because it's still a very small market, and therefore one or few big players can, in a way, centralize all the transactions in a certain period of time. The market manipulation we've seen are either because the market are small (pink slip pump&amp;dump) or because they are highly centralized at some point (london fix for FX, or the LIBOR).
Bitcoin is trading 24/7 and there is no equivalent to a London Fix. So, once the market grows we will stop seeing the rampant market manipulation that we see nowadays.

How do they work?
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:25:18
Nope. You have 500USDx4. Send them to India using four different services and see how many Rupees you get with each service. Then you can infer all the other costs you mention.

The graph does not make sense. It would be so much better if they stated how many rupees the recipient received and compare that. Eg.:
WU 33190
Moneygram 33100
ZebPay 33200

Technically since the beginning of time. Or if he/she/they mean the inception of bitcoin it would be more accurate 2009, since that's when the first bitcoin was mined:

How about: Be your own bank, unless you don't want to be your own bank, in which case you have hundreds of custodians to chose from?
It was too long to fit in a slogan, so we shortened it. People lose cash all the time: stolen, misplaced, burnt, rotten away, stolen again... So I would say that Bitcoin is an improvement if you care about self sovereignty and worry about the power that the current banking system has.

Rational people only care about the price they got in, anything earlier is just a missed opportunity.

That is true, but that's only relevant if he is trying to flip them before the bubble bursts, which I don't think is his case. If he were to wait for the bubble to burst and then buy, he'd probably be able to get x2 bitcoins for the same price, since most likely the price will stabilize well below $400.
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:29:44

Alternatively, there are many lawyers that believe in the cause of SR and bitcoins, and who would be willing to accept bitcoins as payment. Obviously, officially he would be working pro bono.

You are aware that you are buying in the middle of a bubble, right? Unless you are trying to flip them, I'd wait until the price comes back down. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:45:30
That's interesting

Are you drawing a conclusion from a sample of what? 2? 3? 
Even if your answer was as high as 10 or a 1000 this should not be the most upvoted comment. While it is certainly not false, it gives the idea that the price can never go lower than the previous high, and this is dangerous. The price can do whatever the heck it wants, and the markets can't be predicted. 
This is a book on the subject that everyone should read:

Either way, this will be a very interesting trial for the bitcoin community. It will also help bitcoin get some exposure, maybe for the wrong reasons, but exposure nonetheless.

There are, but SR relied highly on reviews and credibility of the sellers, from the perspective of the buyers. From the perspective of the sellers, they could trust SR, so they had incentives to sell there.
Building all that trust again may take some time. But obviously, we are talking about a very lucrative business, so there is no reason why a person sitting in Russia, China or Somalia wouldn't try to start a new SR. On a side note; running it from the US was pretty dumb.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:03:06
I'm just talking about the current bubble. The price went from $100 to $400 in just a few days, if that's not a bubble what is? 
Yeah, yeah, if he is in for the long run who cares if it costs 400 or 100 today? Well the thing is that if he waits until this mini bubble, if you wish, bursts he will be able to get x2 bitcoins for the same price.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:39:56
They don't auction off drugs after they seize them, so I'm thinking that they will probably "destroy" them.
