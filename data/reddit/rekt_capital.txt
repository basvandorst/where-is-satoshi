Two data points is all we have to our disposal at the moment

I wouldn't say so, institutional interest is a very good thing for the ecosystem.

The future is bright, there's no doubt about that :)

Litecoin's price action prior to and after its Halvings has always differed significantly compared to what we see with Bitcoin's price prior to and after Halvings.

My pleasure, happy to help

Much appreciated, thank you

Absolutely, the beauty about Market Cycles is that they are fundamentally underpinned by human psychology: predictably irrational, repeatable, cycling from fear to greed, greed to fear. It's ultimately these extreme emotions that govern the exponential highs and the deep 80%+ retraces that have followed every Bitcoin bull run. But now that Bitcoin has entered a new bull market, patience and HODLing is definitely a viable strategy and one that will surely pay-off months after the Halving.

While that may be true in the short-term, in the mid- to long-term (i.e. specifically after the Halving) it won't be profitable for miners to sell BTC below $10,000.

This is quite interesting because Bitcoin recently reached all-time low levels on the Fear &amp; Greed Index as well. 
Even though BTC rallied +330% since mid-December 2018, people are feeling more fearful towards Bitcoin at the current price of \~$10,000 compared to the fear people felt towards BTC at its mid-December 2018 bottom of $3,200.

I responded to this limitation here: [

Yes. The top was $270 after which an ~80% retrace occurred (i.e. a bear market). The $1260 top was the ATH that followed that bear market. Fundamentally, these are two different Bitcoin Market Cycles.

Means a lot, thank you

Thank you, glad you enjoyed it!

I wouldn't focus too much on what price BTC could potentially reach. The most important takeaway is that BTC will likely surpass its All-Time high months after the Halving.
The article is purely focused on the technicals underpinning Bitcoin's price action. But from a fundamental standpoint, a BTC ETF could be a major catalyst for Bitcoin's price.
Not looking too far for additional examples, the Halving is making BTC an increasingly deflationary, scarce asset and this will inevitably factor itself into price as demand begins to exceed supply.

That's a good way to think about it. For exponential uptrends to occurs, normal retraces are needs in an otherwise healthy growth cycle. 
Sideways action is simply buyers and sellers negotiating with one another, exchanging coins, with one side gathering in strength. Depending on the context of this price action, it could be accumulation or distribution. But in the overall context of this current market cycle and new bull market, Bitcoin is in accumulation mode. BTC has a tendency of dipping up to -40% on bull market retraces.
As for manipulation, though the market may be manipulated to some extent, people generally tend to place too much emphasis on "whales'" impact on price.

And this may very well be the case as of today, but this will diametrically change after the Halving in May 2020 which will cut the block reward in half and it will simply not make sense financially to stay in business for many miners.
Therefore some miners might quit the mining business, but many will simply HODL Bitcoin so as not to sell it below a certain level (and this also affects Bitcoin's price accordingly)

There are only two Halvings that we can analyse and seeing as each Halving occurs roughly every 4 years, sample size is going to be a problem for a long time when it comes to such investigations. But based on the data available, these are the tendencies.

Bitcoin tends to rally exponentially after the Halving so the phase where people make songs about lambos is yet to come
@_date: 2019-09-11 22:43:40
Thanks man, much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:13:13
All the vital signs point to a new bull market. The Halving is coming up also which has figured as a strong catalyst for Bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2019-09-11 22:29:01
You and me both sir!

That's right
