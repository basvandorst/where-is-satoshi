100 and 150 isnt a big difference. Dont get me wrong its a good amount to start but if you said 100 or 1500 then its a different story as far as your gameplan. The level youre at, cost dollar averaging is your best bet, hell, for anyone its their best bet. DCA means buying little by little at different times to reduce your loss risk. So every week, buy $100 of bitcoin or an alt coin that youve done a good amount of research on, if thats something you can do. Even 25 a week adds up. 
First rule though: only invest what you can afford to lose. If you convert it to crypto, consider it a gamble. Dont come back posting about your house mortgage crisis, it sucks seeing the replies.
Research research research. Get interested..it is an investment after all. Know what youre spending your money on. 
Check websites, whitepapers, roadmaps, review the company's team and their history. Search Reddit for help but dont believe every little post. Most coins Ive seen have a sub for each coin. You can even make your own multisub and list all coins so you can see news on each coin, all in one sub. That was a lot to say jeez
Disregard emotions and understand mistakes will be made but you can limit that by being precautious. The other day I lost $70 worth of lumens (Stellar) bc I rushed and deleted my account. Foolish but lesson learned. Peep my past posts lol Take your time with wallets, transfers, conversions, passwords/keys/seeds.
And by all means, have fun if you can. Its fun and scary and exciting and nerve wracking but my favorite part is putting my own money in my own wallet (NO BANK) and at work watching my amount increase. It will decrease too so just be patient and find other activities or hobbies to take your mind off. 
And on a personal note; I really believe and hope crypto will give financial power and freedoms back to the little people. So thank you for taking an interest, youre helping the world big dog 
Welcome to the ride :)

Get the tx info, and grab the addresses sent and received too. Im sure if I cant help figure out what happen, someone will see this and you having the info already will save you time lol 
Ive learned this myself the hard way :b
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:05:02
So basically, if you did send them just $20, that fee would be high, just not $160 high..can you get anymore info?

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:33:52
It seems like were going right back to having a middle man for transactions, unless Im understanding this wrong

Locked in at 19k then dropped to 16k lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:02
Wow..I know you have to love opening your portfolio
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:30
A bank, which is what the person I replied to was talking about. You could have just spotted that and replied with substance instead of typing asshat retorts back to simple questions. Thanks for your massive waste of space.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:53:33
I hope anyone that has taken the initiative to invest and utilize crytocurrency gets what theyve been looking for as they deserve. To the moon for each their own. Good luck everyone, hodl fast and steady, enjoy the ride 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:04:26
Ok so like a bank but without having to wait for them to open up so you can Withdrawl. Got it, makes sense, thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:43:40
Oh I will never forget this lol its been a day 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:22:46
Like a bank as in a 3rd party holding your currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:51
Well worded, thanks for the explanation Rhoads
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:45:18
I hope you figure this out and get your coins, maybe lose a lil fee as a lesson 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:22
Lol I got locked in at 19k this morning. Literally seconds later coinbase updates to 16k for a good hour ffs gotta love the ride tho. Staying up watching the ticker blow past 15k with a breeze has been a rush
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:37
Its ***MY*** money and I want it ***NOW***
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:52:48
Thsnks for explaining. I thought the idea of bitcoin was to remove a use of a middle man whether its mandatory or just for ease of use
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:57
This is endless amounts of true and well said
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:39
So instead of stating Im wrong, an explanation would help
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:39:58
I used to have these luxuries, before I sold all to buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:48:23
The cake line had me in the store snorting ffs

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:16:23
Thanks! Trying now
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:24:20
Sounds accurate 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:32:04
What do we say when we call? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:14:57
My post is literally a response to manipulation lol How could I not see it. My point is, how do I know there arent bots or paid people pushing bitcoins narrative? Both parties make great points, and Im not reddit sluthe so I cant spot a bot like that. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:16:12

@_date: 2017-11-07 22:51:38
Wow I deffo learned this in computer class; 'Just look at the website'. My researching skills have defaulted to just asking others lol thank you for the help tho
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:37:18
Exactly this. Im this person you are talking about. Its so bad that I thought itd be quicker to just have USD on the exchange itself to make transactions quicker. Nope.org/JesusChrist/WhatHaveIDone.jpg

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:59:15
Im really confused and tired of jumping between these two subs. One moment Im certain the opp coin is sabotaging. Then the next monent I think its vice versa.....
I just want to make the right decision for my future..why is it this confusing to make a better life?? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:13:01
Well thats the thing, it hasnt even gotten on the account yet. Still says pending. I have pending bitcoin that I bought and actual money Ive tried to just have on the USD account 
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:35:23
Sounds like they provided more information than your bland insult attempt 
@_date: 2018-03-04 05:42:37
