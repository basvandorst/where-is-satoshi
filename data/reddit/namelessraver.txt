GO WATCH TV. 
I already pay for bandwidth to do with as I please, not for your content-per-pageview/click. GTFO. 
EDIT: below is a reply to your deleted comment 
like i said, I've paid for the INTERNET CONNECTION. I can do whatever I want with how i experience and interact with websites (incoming traffic). Paying monthly for *"Internet Without Ads*" sets a dangerous idea that all websites (*...and other web-traffic perhaps? it's a slippery slope*) should/would/could have ads.
If you are fine with advertising, fair enough, but nobody is OBLIGATED to view ads or be forced to PAY to block them.

I will pay for tangible good that I want or need, but content does not have any value based solely on the fact it exists. 
The fact of the matter is that content creators are implicitly agreeing to GIVE AWAY CONTENT FOR FREE when they put it online without any BARRIERS to accessing it. Less *tangible* content (easily copied media - text, images, digital sound, etc), naturally slips through many barriers, such as DRM and Paywalls. 
Perhaps content creators should realize that their livelyhoods should be based on non-digital income, rather that whining about how they arent making money off of things that people only ACCIDENTALLY click on.

How does this work? i thought a bitcoin was essentially a hash of some sort? 
EDIT: ok i read the Myth FAQ on the side, still have questions.








how does this work technically? when mining bitcoins, do you not mine them one at a time?

if bitcoins hit 100$ each, will they maintain their usefullness? you cant have fractions of a bitcoin.
