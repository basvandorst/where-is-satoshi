[serious] investing in bitcoin is speculAtion at best. It could just as easily hit zero. Besides, asking when you can retire is such a vague question. Everyone has different lifestyle and quality of life goals for retirement. $500k might be enough for one and not enough for another.

50% of what though. I might make $75k a year another might make $30k and someone else might make $500k. There would be big deference’s in what could be saved.
