When you have a shit tonne of money on an exchange and it gets hacked, it tends to distract you from the vacation. This shit has nearly ruined the first few days since I've been staying up trying to get all the news I can
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:36:11
A shit tonne
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:26:13
I recognise that, but not all of us are in this for the "long haul".
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:32:40
Why so salty?
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:47:20
Stop advertising, the question wasn't directed at you.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:12:51
And just to clarify, since my Balance was exclusively in USD I should be able to withdraw my full balance via wire transfer to a UK bank account once withdrawals are re-enabled?
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:03:19
Is there even a vague e.t.a on when withdrawals will be back online? Are we talking days, weeks or longer?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:25:59
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:23:01
My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:08:33
Bitfinex is not. From a quick google it looks like BitGo are insured (let's hope it's their fault lol).
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:32:44
Surely I could just buy ethereum with it?
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:59:16
Hey man, so just to clarify, if i only had a balance in USD on the website then I am unaffected correct?
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:57:55
I emailed compliance yesterday in order to try and verify my account. I still have not heard back from them. I understand they are busy, but when could I expect to get an answer from them?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:31:12
Oh I didn't see that, my bad. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:01:41
I asked him, and he said the earliest physically possible was Monday, but that doesn't mean t will happen
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:17:43
Buy me skins :p
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:29:33
After this bitfinex shit I really cant
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:46:20
Yeah, but when?
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:46:41
I hope you didn't get hit bad.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:48:39
How would I go through the process of verifying over the next few days? Is there an email address I can send information to?
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:16:51


A line I've heard a lot over the last few days by people who are clearly ok with their Bitcoin being completely exposed to devaluation on a hard drive and claiming that it's a more logical decision than leaving it on an exchange that could be hacked at some point.
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:09:14
No kidding, if you have a different opinion, you're a cunt.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:16:36
I rarely ever downvote people. I even said above that what you said was right. I should have done more research about Bitcoin, the only reason I mentioned CDs was because i saw someone mention them in a thread on here. I recognise a better place to store them would be a trezor. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:01:12
Nah, he's just sleeping.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:21:45
You guys really are stubborn. Go live in a cave with your cold storage come back on here in 200 years or whenever
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:23:11
Now they're gonna "identify the hacker".
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:44:38
Yeah but that's your money as a person who uses bitfinex. You (an employee of bitfinex) are not taking cash out of your bank account + a loan to make things right (not that you have a reason to).
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:52:21
But this is a situation where we are simulating liquidation, I mean my balance was just in USD, they're taking my money to payback the Bitcoin guys, but they would have taken my money anyway in order to repay the Bitcoin guys. At least this way we avoid the shit show that would be a lawsuit and as a result get more of our money back.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:32:07
More of a reason to hold onto them lol.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:26:16
I'm not a gambler. I moved my coins onto the website and kept it in USD because I didn't want to leave it exposed to price fluctuations. I don't gamble on the prices fluctuating, I just use it for my business. I was just going to cash it out when I got back from vacation. It's pretty cunty of you to be happy that I lost a shit tonne of money.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:49:46
If I have Bitcoin on a hard drive or cd etc, it takes significantly longer for me to get access to it (something I require for business reasons).
As for Mt Gox, you've got me there. I was naive and didn't expect something like this to happen. That being said, if I had researched Mt Gox, I probably still would have acted the way I did
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:37:01
What is meant by "an active loan to BTCUSD positions". If I had a balance in USD because I had sold Bitcoin does this mean I will be included in the socialising of losses? Sorry for the noob question.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:36:03
Yeah, but I would have been exposed to the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin. Also I only started using Bitcoin 6 months ago so I never knew about Mt Gox.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:44:51
Long term you are probably right, but I just wanted to check that as of right now no-one has stolen it
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:38:23
I have(had) ~$28,000 in USD on there. I am fucked if they are insolvent.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:34:40
Don't get me wrong, I think bitfinex caused the hack to happen because they preferred speed of access to safety which is greedy but at this stage that's irrelevant to me. As for bitfinex taking losses from this, I'm pretty sure that's a false assumption you're making. already said that a lot of bitfinexs resources were put into this. It seems to me that people are expecting iFinex employees/owners to personally finance a "bail in" which in a perfect world would happen but in this case it won't, either way it's irrelevant given that iFinex is an LLC so of r were to be liquidated we wouldn't recieve that money anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:01:21
I guess I'm unaffected then. I hope you're doing ok during all of this mate, it's a shitty place for everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:53:21
Yeah I had sold it, hopefully they will let me wothdraw.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:03:18
There are a bunch of people on this subreddit who seemingly keep their coins on physical drives off exchange and seemingly don't realise that other people need very fast access to their coins for trading purposes. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:04:23
I can wait a bit of time. I doubt I get nothing, I'll take the 64% now and BFX coin. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:21:17
Hey any estimate as to when withdrawals will be available?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:39:56
This seems like the best of a bad situation. All these idiots talking about suing should realise that this is the best chance of them getting the most money back. If enough people sued, bitfinex would have to liquidate and users would most likely recieve less than 64% after that process is over. I have a lot on the site so it's not like I'm losing nothing here.
Also to all you cunts complaining that you didn't make money from your shorts, fuck you. People lost their savings and you're complaining you didn't profit? How selfish are you?
Last question, when will withdrawals via bank transfer be reenabled?
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:12:53
I'd just like to take this time to thank for helping to keep me sane during this roller coaster ride of emotions. Bitfinex has proved to me that it is a stand up company throughout the last few days, I fully intend to continue to use bitfinex after this event.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:44:02
I really don't understand. I moved Bitcoin onto bitfinex, I then proceeded to convert the Bitcoin into a USD balance. I never loaned anything out, I wasn't going to recieve returns from me having a stable USD balance. 
Having a USD balance is exactly the same as having a balance in any other crypto currency that can be used on your exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:47:34
Yeah, I think you're right. But I also think that if they hadn't socialised the losses there is a greater chance that they would have become insolvent (this is just speculation though).
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:45:19
I wasn't even trading, I had a shit tonne on there as I was going to cash it out. Just happened to go down before o withdrew.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:01:36
If I have a USD balance in bitfinex that is in my exchange Wallet, should I be able to cash out via wire transfer through the website?
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:17:20
Here's the thing, I want my money now. At this point I've seen the numbers, I like many other people have been following this hardcore since it happened. 
It really seems as though the solution Bitfinex came up with is the "best case" in terms of time/money. I don't want to have to sue them, this requires effort and money that I'd rather not invest into what could be a long lawsuit.
The fact that I did nothing wrong and yet still lose money sucks. I wasn't even trading, I was just going to cash out for bank transfer. Now I've had around $10,000 disappear into thin air, it's safe to say I'm mad. However suing iFinex and pushing for liquidation/bankruptcy is like trying to draw blood from a stone (and at the same time injuring your hand).
If we just all went along with this plan, BFX might work and we'd all get more of our money back. The more successful bitfinex is, the faster we all get our money back. Although I should add that in my opinion iFinex as a company should make 0 profits from now until every cent is paid back (with interest).
Also to all the people who are saying this is an inside job and that all iFinex staff should go to jail. Until you have proof, please stop just posting accusations. It's kind of cringy seeing people write anger filled paragraphs about "corporate shills" and joking about how everyone who kept money on an exchange is an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:08:53
I don’t wanna be labelled as FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:12:38
I'm not trying to shill, just memeing
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:32:36
If you wanna pay with bitcoin you have to pay when you order /s
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:32:48
Unless i've missed something, when you withdraw bitcoin onto something like a Trezor, you're essentially just holding bitcoin. If the value of Bitcoin drops from say $1118 to $800, you still lose money because the funds on your trezor are in Bitcoin, not USD
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:51:47
The issue I have with this is that if some exchange is hacked and we do withdraw our coins. We'd get fucked by the insane drop in value of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:58:21
PayPal took over 15k from me in fees from business usage. I can't wait until more people can pay me in btc
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:45:16
Hedge your bets, invest 40-50%. It's not a risk worth taking.
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:10:00
But everyone said btc would be worth millions.... lmao
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:12:22
Lol, we can only dream
@_date: 2016-10-29 09:33:25
The money that was on there was working capital, I sold my bfx tokens at 0.44 so I lost about 15% of my total balance ($10,000). I made the decision that it was better to sell the tokens and use the funds to make money back through my business.
@_date: 2016-10-29 01:38:49
@_date: 2016-10-28 22:01:50
Lost 10k on bitfinex, bitcoin is great to use, but that hurt alot
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:53:58
Oh I know, and I think bitcoin will be fine. Just no one is posting about bitcoin having a short drop, try only post about positive stuff.
I am a hodler
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:59:52
I'm a little annoyed by the lack of relevant content on here yeah.
Seriously where is the point in posting this article other than to convince some newbie to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:30:09
All the doom and gloom is downvoted so that no-one is tempted to sell their coins. $500 Drop? Move along, nothing to see here
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:56:16
But someone posting this type of article is just silly
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:52:57
Exactly, the only reason the price dropped was because of people speculating, nothing actually changed, my faith in bitcoin hasn't shifted.
I just find it ridiculous that the only content posted here is articles explaining why bitcoin will be $10,000 in ten days or w.e
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:53:47
