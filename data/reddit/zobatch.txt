The only pushing is to a source code repository. Just because the code is in "production" doesn't mean I have to download and run it.

The culture is not the regime. There are dissidents and a large number of people who consume contraband: e.g. foreign films.

They don't. It's a safe deposit box. It's trustless.
@_date: 2014-07-30 03:10:29


No I don't.


Not it isn't. Who does what is irrelevant. The question is about trusting the devs and you shouldn't trust them regardless of who they are.

But it won't. People's money is at stake here and the government has a compelling interest in maintaining a functioning economy.

You know of lots of banks that offer full reserve accounts. The banks call them "[safe deposit boxes]( Or you could keep your money in your own safe.
I wasn't going to do it, but I'm compelled to point out the incredible logic: "I don't know how to do **x**, therefore it is impossible."

I thought this sub was about bitcoin, not politics. I really think this is off-topic.

I think you misunderstand. He just means that "bits" are a subunit; just like "cents" are a sub-unit. The analogy doesn't extend to where you've taken it in order to correct it.

Anyone who unconditionally supports bitcoin is from 'this subreddit'. Anyone who disagrees is a shill paid by wall street to post negative things about bitcoin.

Upvote for relevant links, downvote for lack of class. This shitpost at least sparked a couple of interesting conversations. +1 for that, I guess.

That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You know what else doesn't have this particular kind of flaw? Cancer. Let's post this to r/cancer

They aren't forced to do any such thing. They can keep their own cash and manage their own risk.
Look, I'm not an economist, nor am I a banker. GP was talking about "normal people" getting full reserve accounts. The safe deposit box fits such a scenario just fine. "Normal people" don't need to worry about payroll.

There are lots of nodes, not all of which are run by people who aren't programmers. Sure, it's possible, but only if the majority of the network blindly trusts the core devs. *Trustless* means you don't *have* to trust.

I can't accidentally hand cash to the person behind me in line instead of to the cashier.
But basically yes. Bitcoin needs to be improved. It's not ready for the masses. Until sending and receiving bitcoin are idiot proof this is going to be the price of evangelizing to people who aren't ready to use it.

Related doesn't mean relevant.

You're trying to make the post relevant. On its own the article belongs in a different sub. If OP had made some critical observation or otherwise added some analysis related to bitcoin (beyond "this is why we need bitcoin") then I'd be okay with it. I'm generally in agreement with you about bitcoin and its merits as a payment system. What I'm not in agreement with is that this article should be in this sub in the first place.
Also, cute wasn't my intention. Your logic about what's relevant or not is completely flawed: the fact that something is not something else doesn't make it relevant. I do know what you mean, and that's the problem. Somehow you think that because you can make a connection between one thing and another that makes it inherently on topic. It doesn't. My house doesn't have the problems of credit card payment networks; that doesn't make it relevant.
My point is just that on its own the post is off topic.

It's not about you. It's about tfa. If the article were about some iOS specific vulnerability that led to people's data being stolen it belongs on an iOS subreddit; otherwise if it goes on the android sub it's just "hur durr Android doesn't have that problem wink wink" and adds nothing of value.
Let's say I subscribe to a local newspaper: The Sburb Daily. And let's say Sburb is a suburb of some city in Georgia.
Now let's say there's a city in California which experiences heavy traffic congestion. I don't care to see an article about that city's traffic problems on my local paper. "But that traffic problem is relevant to you because you live in a place that doesn't experience it. Therefore we should talk about how traffic in small towns like yours is better."
Somebody going on a subreddit and asking for a direct comparison is relevant because it specifically asks for discussion. If I post a random article on r/iOS or whatever about a Nokia brick phone, is that relevant?

*Cannot* seems like the wrong word. AFAIK companies don't pay in cash because it complicates the process. Paying somebody for their labor seems to fall under "all debts public and private." If you've got references to the contrary you should share them.

Here's a [pbs article][1] about it. Basically it says the number is actually 1.2 Trillion because if you borrow 100 dollars a day for 365 days and at the end of each day you pay back 90 dollars, the amount of money still loaned out at the end of the 365 days is 3,650 dollars, not 36,500.

You're wrong. Nobody needs to accept code changes on github. Just because you changed your copy of Harry Potter to say "Harry Potts" doesn't mean it changed everyone else's copy.

Articles about malaria outbreaks may or may not be relevant to vaccines. It would depend on the content. If the article mentions the impact that vaccines could have, or if the article mentions the availability of vaccines, then it would be relevant.
Essentially the guideline is this: If an average person read the article, would bitcoin even cross their mind?
