I'm not reading all that
Currencies are simply social constructs and based on trust. If both the currency and system (Bitcoin) can be trusted without trusting through the consumption of energy and game theory, then the currency and system ought to be trusted
The consumption of energy is the backing because it is what creates the trust without trusting within the ecosystem

@_date: 2018-06-18 23:03:41
Work really is the backing - because work is energy. The only logical thing we as humans should give value to are sources and outputs of energy.
We are really in an upside down world right now with the fiat system where prices of sources and outputs of energy have been pushed to historical low - and that has HUGE implications to waste.
Think about it from the most fundamental human value level - what do we need? Food, water and electricity - all sources of energy.

You're right there might not be Jesus. But the story of Mary and Jesus tell us something about the human condition that I will be explaining in later episodes. The ressurection of Jesus is of his Spirit - that is actually a metaphor and I will again be explaining it later.
True - maybe Islam describes something about the human condition too. I do not know since I have not gotten into Islam yet. But looking at what is currently happening in the Middle East, if I'm to study the Islamic stories I think I would be careful. 
The stories are simply literature to me describing the human condition - they are like mythologies. I never take them literally

It's just that a lot of church schools misrepresent Jesus as a super nice guy...

And if he could, then of course God could

You're right. Religion was useful for bringing Order to humanity. But like you said, it also brought a lot of fear for the masses during those times. It was also an indoctrination method to subdue the masses in doing the works for those at the top of the social hierarchy at that time. Modern consumerism is basically playing the role of the Higher Being God from before.
My approach in interpreting the Bible is a rational one - so I do not believe in a Higher Being God. But I cannot deny a possibility of its existence. I do think the Bible is really a genius set of stories - the greatest literature of all time to be honest
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:58:43

Actually the bond yield has historically shot up and down rapidly - and this is even after the financial crisis when lots of control and regulations got in place. If they are really dumping their treasuries and reducing money supply, they will be actively increasing the bond yield and the private sector will know - so the private sector will dump as well. But we are seeing the opposite. Are you saying they are dumping their treasuries, but the private sector is keeping? That's stupid as hell - I will immediately sell my bonds and depositing money in the bank account for the higher interest rates in the coming few months if the Fed is really dumping their treasuries. No one who understands bonds will keep their bonds if the Fed is dumping already - and the bond yield will logically increase, not decrease
Is the methodology you speak of the one where they claim to be wanting to complete QT without "crashing the bond market" and "crashing the stock market"?
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:18:40
Yes - all fiat currencies eventually fail and die. The average age of a fiat currency is around 27 years - so the US Dollar is an outlier.
You're right - it actually might lead to full blown WW3. In fact right now what's happening in the Middle East is kind of life WW3 don't you think? It's just a proxy one.

Lol what? How would QT not shoot yields up? Do you really buy into the nonsense that they will be able to flatten the bond yield without reducing money supply?
That is actual wishful thinking. If they are really reducing money supply (doesn't matter if it is dumping treasuries or just letting old treasuries mature), bond yields MUST go up. The only explanation for bond yields not going up is that the market is beginning to think that the Fed is lying and they are NOT reducing money supply - otherwise this thing would have shot up already to at least 3.5

If you suck out 10 billion more dollars of liquidity out of the system, the impact cascades because market cap are fake numbers. When you take out 1 million from the stock markets, you are actually reducing the market cap by a lot more
Edit: and just for record I’m saying they say they were going to introduce 10 billion more USD every month of QT starting July (this month) - 10 billion MORE from the programme that they claim they been running. So yields not rising is very very sketchy
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:57:33
It is a good TA. Simple supply and demand.
People still calling for 4,000 and 3,000 are probably in shorts at 6,000 and emotionally attached.
Markets tend to go up, and you see very clear dwindling selling pressure which means supply is low 
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:12:31
I agree with you. Individual assets should be looked at differently.
The dotcom crash did not trigger property prices to fall. 
But the financial crisis did - interest rate hike causing subprime defaults leading retail and corporates to the rush for deleveraging from all assets into cash to increase liquidity
We won’t know what happens because the market is psychological. An imminent stock market crash might just be similar to the dotcom crash - where all other assets remain doing its own thing.

@_date: 2018-07-08 03:04:42
Many of them are also saying that it is strange the bond yield is decreasing.
Modest in impact? Wow very clearly you have never used leverage or borrowed money.
In fact, I don't think you even know that there is really only one way this is going - the Fed will never be able to pay back the national debt. They can either default or print more money - but we all know the Fed will never default. So they will continue to print more money and decrease interest rates until hyper inflation. And that will be when cryptocurrencies will take over the financial system along with Gold/Silver.
This will happen even if they hike interest rates and we see an asset bubble collapse first - they will lower interest rates again (mega QE this time) to save the economy. It will work, but the USD will enter hyper inflation soon after.
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:08:56
I understand what that article is saying. In fact what the article is saying is exactly what I mean - if the supply of money decreases, then bond yield will increase.
The article is saying that the objective for the Fed is to not crash the bond and stock market. The bond market objective is to not have the bond yield move sharply higher, but it will definitely go higher if they are to increase interest rates and QT - just that the objective is to prevent it from spiking up suddenly and the bond prices crashing. But we are actually seeing bond yields decreasing.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:15:37
If the Fed is reducing money supply (through dumping US treasuries either through themselves or private sector), then the bond yield should increase. It doesn't make sense for the bond yield to decrease. The Fed is part of the market that influences the bond yield, whether you like it or not
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:08:43
In anticipation for quantitative tightening - since an increase in bond yield increases the price of USD

@_date: 2018-07-08 01:58:51
Every bubble we see now will burst - real estate, stock market, derivatives market. It will be the most catastrophic financial crisis we will ever see. Which is why when it happens, it will probably not last longer than a few weeks. Because very likely they will step in and stop the QT to save the economy and begin mega QE. The economy will recover for a bit, but it will be at a great cost - it will cause hyper-inflation and the US Dollar will be killed.
@_date: 2018-07-07 04:58:21
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:32:25
Yes if old bonds mature, then the principal is paid back - which is the same as the United States dumping the bond.
I don't understand your burning dollar comparison. I think you're referring to the liquidity phrase? I only use that word when talking about a company - anyway that's not important...
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:21:53
I know it went up a bit until May 2018 - it is strange that it is not increasing even more ever since March. If they were really going with the QT program, bond yield should have skyrocketed by now. An increase of 0.15 from March to May was nothing
Instead, we see it DECREASING
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:58:48
Yes if the US 10-year bond yields do not rise in the coming weeks, it is quite clear that they do not intend to quantitative tightening.
In fact they will have to continue the easing the USD will begin its road to hyper inflation
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:22:56
If they really don't increase the bond yields and pick up the pace for interest rate hike, then we will skip the asset bubble collapse part and go straight into hyper-inflation. Then it will probably take around 2-3 years.
If they hike the interest rate to pop the bubble, then it will probably take a bit longer, maybe 3-4 years.

You are ABSOLUTELY right
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:33:17
Yes I know so that means the Bond Yield should increase, not decrease - but we see the opposite happening
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:25:06
You know that the plan that they said they would do is to increase the QT by a further 10 billion USD this month (July) right? And instead of seeing bond yields increasing this month, we see a constant decline ever since March 2018.
Lol if this doesn’t raise red flags for you, then fair enough - it is related to trust which is why there is these disputes. Which Bitcoin aims to solve anyway. So either way I would be holding Bitcoin on this side of the trade. I’ll see you on the other side
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:55:56
Probably around 200-300 billion already. By end of this year there would probably be around 500-600 tightened in total. By end of next year 1.2 trillion and 1.6 trillion the following year.
So it doesn’t make sense for bond yield to not increase - it should be increasing progressively faster not slower. Unless they are lying
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:19:36
Thanks again that makes a lot of sense.
I know this question might not matter in the future if what you say will come into fruition where there really will be a divide, but are you bullish on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:21:39
I think you misunderstand what is happening. The trade war (and potentially Brexit) will be the trigger for stopping the quantitative tightening programme (which I honestly think they have stopped already ever since March since the bond yield stopped increasing), and continue quantitative easing. This will cause the USD to hyper-inflate and assets to rapidly appreciate in value. Eventually there will be no point in valuing anything against USD because the USD will be dead. Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Commodities, Properties (and maybe fiat currencies tied to gold/silver) will be the new standard. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:07:40
I think you need to get one thing straight.
The US prints money by having two books - one to credit and one to debit. The way that the US Government DECREASES interest rate is to PRINT money by issuing bond and buying this bond. So they have two books. One that is issuing the bond and another that is buying the bond - but really, they are the same bloody US Government.
If they are doing QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING, which means INCREASING interest rate, then they would print LESS money and dumping their bonds that they hold - REMEMBER they have TWO books.
So no it is not purely market sentiment
Edit: I know it is counter intuitive, but when the price of US dollar rises and interest rate rises, the bond yield needs to rise and bond prices fall
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:16:55
Just a disclaimer I now only hold 2% of my portfolio in USD. I hold no bonds. All my assets are either on properties or cryptocurrency. I also hold no gold - and planning to buy some in next few months. Physical gold, not paper gold - because paper gold will be also go to zero when the reset begins
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:38:08
Having old treasuries mature and dumping treasuries is the same thing.
Bond yield will increase, not decrease
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:19:22
Wow you're really in denial
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:58:25
I agree with your points. There is a difference this time that will make gold silver bitcoin commodities rise. This time if they “save the economy” again through mega QE, it’s going to kill the dollar. And these guys, they aren’t going to start pumping money into stocks again - they are going to start pumping into things worth REAL value - things that require work to be created. 
Last time they were able to bail out the rich and do it by not killing the dollar through initial stages of QE, so they could still put on a show by pumping the stock markets and declaring “the economy is good”, when the economy is going haywire - but the next stage has high probability of killing the dollar.

@_date: 2018-07-08 06:56:20
It’s like 30B-40B per month of QT right now - and it rises with each month and will probably reach 50B per month of QT by Q4.
So it is a big deal, unless the market is not paying attention to this... in any case it still doesn’t make sense that the bond yield isn’t progressively increasing
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:48:36
Exactly. If people knew bitcoin will go to 20,000 in 2017 they wouldn’t care if they bought at 1,000 200 or 2
@_date: 2018-07-09 06:48:20
Inflation is already here. The US Government and Central Banks just piled money into the stock markets. It's a ticking time bomb. They are using paper derivatives to push the price of gold/silver down and very likely the rich are stacking up on physical gold/silver right now at low prices.
When you see hyper-inflation, we won't be having the time posting here on Reddit. We'll be like Venezuela.
When you see the bond yield curve inverting, that's when the bond sell off will occur, leading to all other asset bubbles bursting. Will they pump into the stocks again and cycle repeat? Maybe but my guess is that they will pump into physical gold/silver/commodities/Bitcoin.

He should really shave his head, it’ll look a lot better
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:42:28
Please elaborate. My understanding has always been that an increase in bond yield leads to an increase in price of USD
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:58:19
I think what you mean by "removing liquidity" is removing money supply.
The way they remove money supply is to sell back the bonds that they issued to themselves. So the way the market knows that the money supply is decreased is if the bond yield increases. So they can't decrease money supply by not having the bond yield increase (and USD value increasing and bond price decreasing)

@_date: 2018-07-02 13:25:02
Just stating the technical indicators here....
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:56:10
I think they should explain why the bond yield hasn't increased since March 2018
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:50:03
I’m saying that they might have tried to tighten it but realise they couldn’t do it without popping the bubbles - since we already saw the cracks in the stock market and property market. So instead of QT, they’ve been doing QE again since March 2018 (or May 2018 whatever). Which is why the bond yields are decreasing - and stock and bond market recovering in prices. 
But soon the yield curve will invert, and that will be when the private sector will really start dumping and that will spike interest rates and plummet bond prices. With rising interest rate, people are going to exit stock markets (im not even sure if the property market will survive). 
The Fed will step in QUICKLY because the Fed will be asked to do something and they will start buying bonds again to increase money supply and reduce bond yield. And that will cause hyperinflation to the US dollar. Very likely the rich are already stacking up on gold silver bitcoin and other commodities and the money from stocks and the new money being printed will pump into these items and start a new financial system with the US dollar dead
I’m sorry I don’t want this to happen either but the numbers don’t lie. This entire capitalist fiat system is all a numbers game

Yea, title was meant to be a joke haha. He’s called Robert Shiller and he kinda shilled Bitcoin in this video.
I know he was skeptical last time during the world economic forum

It doesn’t take a lot to pop the whole thing... the financial crisis issues were not resolved at all. Each time they printed money to solve bubble popping, it takes less % of interest rate hike and bond yield hike to pop the entire thing
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:46:21
Hahahaha you getting trolled like hell man
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:28:50
Yep that’s right
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:25:47
I think you should read Wellshunter's comment. Graphs and maths don't lie. You know what lies? Central banks and governments.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:32:45
I think you’re confused. If they do pop the bubble by increasing interest rates, everything will go down - there will be civil unrest, which is why they won’t allow it to happen.
Even if they really increase interest rates, it will last probably a few weeks. Afterwards the next phase QE will begin and all assets will start rallying again. 
If you think there will be a short time period of asset pop from interest rate hike then holding USD is a good idea - to buy the dips. But holding bonds is a losing trade on either side
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:44:32
The USD derives value from market perception yes - because there is still trust in US Government. The US Government gives backing to the USD.
What we are seeing right now is an accumulation of all the previous bubbles. The 2008 financial crisis issues were never resolved and each time it requires less % interest rate or bond yield hike to pop all the bubbles. 
Back in 2008 people flocked to cash because the market cap of all markets are fake (still fake today). And since interest rates were hiking prior to the beginning of the collapse, defaults in subprime triggered the need for liquidity in relatively high interest rate environment with over exposed leverage. What happens is a cascade of people going into cash and not even an immediate reduction in interest rates stopped the crash.
So I actually think that the fed will not hike interest rates and this is just a show. Even if they do hike it and pop the bubble, it will be short lived and a new QE will begin very shortly

Yes it's fake Bitcoin. I am simply stating that if they choose to create fake Bitcoin, Wall Street will bankrupt themselves
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:47:13
Yep hahaha 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:18:45
They will. If they buy at $100, they will be pushing the prices upwards to the moon. They gotta buy 50 million of these
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:10:09
They will get bankrupt. I used a very small leverage number above. If they created 50 million more Bitcoin, they will completely go bankrupt even with a half fork
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:59:54
Yea that is exactly the scenario. True - I can understand that the protocol level will not be affected. I just hope the people will be educated enough to understand that the paper Bitcoin will be worthless...
I'm just worried that they might create the paper Bitcoin and then treat it again like fiat currencies and people all begin transacting with these paper Bitcoin for real goods
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:28:39
Not sure why you brought up the Gold Standard and Nixon shock to this
True, they could find a guy to buy Bitcoin at a lump sum with a single price. Who is willing to help them and be this person if there are 10 hard forks?
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:30:14
Yea they are not real Bitcoin. I am describing how Wall Street will get bankrupt if they decide to create fake Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:35:36
Agree - that might happen. There may be two systems created then. One for Wall Street and one for the true Bitcoin community. That's a possibility. I am simply stating that they cannot control it with paper
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:40:17
Thanks - done
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:52:11
Right exactly. My point of view is that we needed nations/religions before because these were very useful conceptual constructs to group and organize a bunch of people to make us more efficient so that we could progress. But we have evolved to a point where we could no longer rely on these constructs because the next step in progression would be to progress on a global scale. I believe that is what the Internet and Bitcoin are offering to us - tools to scale on a global scale. I have a piece where I will explain how Bitcoin marks the end of the age of Pisces ever since the emergence of Jesus Christ. Will have this published in the Bitcoin section - it will use mathematics to make the case
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:27:03
Lol that is called censorship. It’s already happening, nothing new. The Internet and Bitcoin are naturally censorship resistant
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:41:33
You seem extremely informed :) Could you elaborate how the system is currently already uncontrollable?
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:18:01
Just added a dummy page to stop the confusion haha, thanks for letting me know :) I'll reply this message again once those parts are up
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:25:00
Suppose Wall Street printed 50 million extra Bitcoin and only owns 5 million Bitcoin
Bitcoin B gets created via fork - Wall Street owes 100 million Bitcoin and only owns 10 million
Do you know how angry the normal people will get if they don't get their Bitcoin B? It will cause social chaos
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:13:40
Oh it's you again, I remember your reddit ID.
A lot of millennial are confused about gender identity.
The physical aspect of racial identity is indeed white/black/yellow or whatever the physical aspect is representing. The problem begins when the term racial identity is being extended to describe the psychological aspect. That is similar to the idea of nationality. There is no such thing as nationality in the most fundamental part of the human psyche. Nationality is simply a construct in order to divide
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:20:56
Each buy pushes the price upwards. They can print infinite amount of USD, but each time they use the newly printed USD to buy Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price shoot upwards. If they want to buy 21 million or even 50 million Bitcoin, price will shoot to the moon relative to USD. The latter is even impossible
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:56:52
Hey those parts will be up in the next few days. I will message you when those are up.
