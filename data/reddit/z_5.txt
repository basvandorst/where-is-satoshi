International remittance is done daily by tons of average Joes.
Credit cards also used to be targeted at a certain elite, until they became convenient and easy to have. 
Last point not mentioned by this thread's OP: when you pay for something online, you need a credit/debit card. It is a problem for a lot of people who still can't get one. And it poses a problem for security as card numbers and details can be stolen. Bitcoin is like cash: used once and no one has access to your details afterwards.

I don't know how Xapo does it, but I really like their process: they tell you the price, you confirm your buy at that price, they tell you how much you how them, THEN you have 3 working days to transfer them your fiat, and when they receive it they credit your account. I have to say, it's puzzling to me how they can operate this way, but I really find this system the most comfortable from the perspective of the user. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 06:59:29
What makes you think it doesn't work? If you're using a proper wallet (eg Breadwallet, Mycelium, Electrum) where you and only you hold the private key, it will give you a new address to use for each transaction and that will be that. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:16:25
Ok. You're right.
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:34:06
When someone "sends" you bitcoins, in reality they give you "spending rights" over these coins, which are not moving. This transfer of ownership gets then permanently recorded in the blockchain and that's how you know these coins are really yours.
When you just received coins with no confirmation yet, the person who paid you could still be trying to quickly short-circuit their own spending and give the same coins to themselves. As only one transaction will be possible, the transaction that eventually gets recorded in the blockchain will cancel the other one. So, for example, by paying a very high miner fee in the second transaction, they could invalidate the coins they paid to you.
By waiting for confirmations, you ensure they cannot double-spend. This is why it's important for big sum of money (like selling a car), and less so for small sums (like a cup of coffee) or if you trust the person.

Use your own wallet. This means using a wallet where you and only you know the private key.

Breadwallet is pretty straightforward. Usually my friends are easily convinced how simple and straightforward it is. But it's for those who say "ok, I'm hooked, I want more" that I am wondering if there is a better yet still newbie-friendly option. And I am pretty sure paper is not the best option for them.

I disagree because there is no such thing as "essentially zero". Would you rather have zero bullets in your body or 210,000? Would you rather zero dessert-like coffee beverage or 210,000?
Joke aside, I would agree that Bitcoin as a "get rich quick" scheme would definitely not be the best investment at $0.01. But as a transaction system, and more importantly as the way to secure the blockchain, it would function whatever the price, as long as it is not actually zero.
If it went to $0.01 and stabilized there for a year, would you buy some? I know I would. Which would make the value go up, since there is a finite number of coins in circulation. But if it went to actual zero, not only confidence would be lost, but there would be actually no way to buy any.

You mean I carry around a couple of empty paper wallets for when I have such discussion with a friend? I like the idea but I see two problems with it: I will look even more like a lunatic than I do now.

The idea is that if the computer on which you generated the paper wallet is full of malware, your paper wallet itself may be insecure. That was my question actually: better to use a non-jailbroken iOS phone than a Windows computer full of malware I guess?

I discussed that once in a separate thread: using Breadwallet or Electrum as a "cold storage", installed once and uninstalled as soon as you wrote down the seed. Only problem is that you will always use the same public address over and over again, because the software doesn't generate a new one every time since it is uninstalled.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:40:28


Precisely. Not that Karpeles couldn't have done things differently of course, but most people who used his service knew it was risky, unregulated, and potentially dangerous for their funds.
Bitcoin is currently in its "Wild West" stage. At the time, it was the "Wild Wild West" and everyone involved knew it.
For as long as we can remember, people in this sub and elsewhere have said countless times "be your own bank", "if you don't hold the private key, it is not your bitcoin", "only invest what you can afford to lose", over and over. 
Gox was having problems for months and people kept sending money to it, in hopes of getting richer quicker after withdrawals would be available again. Look for threads after threads in this sub of some people warning others how risky it was.
High risk = high rewards. Gox was risky and somewhat dodgy. But no one is complaining about how much easier it made buying BTC in the "early days". 
tl;dr I am not defending Karpeles for his mistakes and his obnoxiousness, I am just pointing out people should also own responsibility over their own risky actions. And, if they want a new, distributed and unregulated money system, they have to deal with the good and the bad that comes with it.
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:30:11
I agree with what you're saying, but... I noticed people get way more interested as soon as I have sent them a buck. I tell them I actually have one buck less and now they have the buying power of a buck "in" their phone, and they start asking many questions. For that, they need to play with Bitcoin in real life, not just watch a PowerPoint slide. (Although, my "show and tell" interactions are usually one-on-one not with groups, it might make a big difference.)
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:07:09

Doesn't Coinbase Vault thing give you the private key?
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:48:40
Please help me understand (honest question, no sarcasm) how they would do it?
Every 10 minutes 25 BTC are entering the pool. Some of it is kept by some miners, the rest is most probably sold on exchanges.
(Let's assume all of it is made available on exchanges.)
If there is more demand than 25 BTC per minute, price will rise. If demand is less, price will fall.
Currently, it is relatively stable, falling gradually. Implying demand is similar to supply. 
I would understand how they could make price go up artificially, but how could they keep it stable or fall?
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:07:33
I always explain to them how the seed is what allows them to access the funds and why it is crucial to back it up. Then, I follow up the next day to make sure they wrote it down in a physically safe place. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:19:11
Don't use the same wallet for Android and iOS. It might complicate the presentation a little bit but you want the best of both sides for the first impression to be optimal. 
And with Breadwallet, you don't actually have to backup the seed before you can use it. It takes a few seconds after installation to start receiving, then you can backup your seed in your own time.
However, on that topic, I think it could be very interesting to spend a couple of minutes explaining why/how the seed is important: ie your coins are not actually on your phone.
(Please make sure they understand no copy-pasting not screenshots. They will need pen and paper for this.)
Also, you might want to have one of the live blockchain services on a big screen so they can see the transactions happen online in real time. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:03:55

I actually introduced Bitcoin to a few people (with almost no knowledge of it) by having them download Breadwallet or Mycelium (depending if iOS or Android) after the meal, and sending them the BTC instantly. Very practical conversation starter. They could always send it back to me and I'd given them fiat of course, but usually they enjoyed that first toe-dipping into crypto. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:41:45
There is no such thing as a free beer. *Someone* has to pay when money is stolen. Credit cards companies would rather not use their own cash to reimburse theft victims...
Figure it out, and stop believing in magic: where does all this "it's insured" money come from?
Hint: Merchants do pay a percentage (often as high as 3% depending on their size) of each sale and often an additional fee per transaction as well.
Merchants also don't always get reimbursed for goods paid with a stolen card.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:47:13
I appreciate your point of view, and I understand where you are coming from, but...


You don't own bitcoin if you don't control the private keys. Period. 


It's really really hard for normal people to be responsible for the consequences of their own actions. It's really really hard for normal people to forget about the instantaneity of Facebook and CNN, and consider the long term. Yet, it is possible and desirable that normal people learn to go back to certain values such as saving and learning to take care of their own assets.
One of the beautiful sides effects of Bitcoin is precisely this.
EDIT: typo and grammar
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:01:01
I get that, but how would it technically function in a system where "they" don't own the miners, and miners bring new BTC into the pool every 10 minutes? I fail to grasp how it is physically possible to control a drop of price (although I understand completely how easy it would be to control an artificial rise of course).
@_date: 2015-06-08 08:15:03

You are in a car moving forward. Is it better to get out of the car and go inside another car which is EXACTLY at the same place as the first car, or to stay in the original car?
The only way it makes sense to sell and reinvest is if you sell high, then it goes down a bit, then you buy low. This way you buy MORE bitcoins for the same dollars.
Say you buy 100 BTC with 100 USD, when 1 BTC = 1 USD. Later, 1 BTC is worth 2 USD. Your 100 BTC are now worth 200 USD. If you buy "200 USD worth of BTC" you'll get 100 BTC just like before. You need to wait and hope that 1 BTC will be worth LESS than 2 USD. for example, it goes down to 1 BTC = 1.5 USD, then you can buy 133 BTC with your 200 USD.
Bonus: by exchanging back and forth you lost money twice (or more) with exchange fees.
tl;dr a) Simple logic. There is no "infinite magic loop". b) Don't gamble money you can't afford to lose. c) This is not "investing", it's risky "speculation".

They hold their clients' BTC and USD in their own account, like an online wallet or a bank, and they just did like Cyprus did a little while back.
If you hold your BTC in your own wallet, no one can prevent you from transferring, but if you ask an online service to hold it for you, they control the private key and they can block transfers.

I understand your point, but this is not like a total just thrown into some sentence, it's almost a sales pitch they use to show how worldwide they are.
It's like if a press release from Apple was saying "10,000,000,000th app in the store!" and then  they realized they didn't count apps properly and there is only half that... Blame the intern, but keep the announcement up for marketing purposes.

When some come to reddit to blame everyone else than themselves, they obviously didn't realise the hard truth that they are responsible for their own misjudgment.
They played with fire and got burned. Everywhere in this sub people keep saying this:
- Be your own bank
- Cold wallets for long term holdings
- Only risk what you can afford to lose
- Exchanges are not banks
Then, for MONTHS Gox is showing signs of crappy management.
These facts prevented a LOT of people to keep their money on Gox... Am I being a dick now by simply stating these facts?
Come on, until the very LAST DAY, with all trading blocked, you could read posts from people (NOT newbies!) who wanted to risk their money to gamble on Gox. We should be careful not to hurt their feelings now?

Well, almost all she writes in the article can be summed up by "I spoke with his family members and they all say he's weird and clever". But it's not enough, and she needed to get a confession out of Dorian himself, so she interpreted the fact that he looked down while denying involvement in BTC into some kind of "half acknowledgement". Basically, the whole article is that moment.
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:54:32
The basis is quite simple really:
a) Bitcoins are being mined constantly, at a regular pace. Many miners don't want to hold and sell their BTC for fiat currency on exchanges.
b) Shops like Overstock and Tigerdirect are putting back BTC on the market (the more successful they are in BTC sales, the more it gets recycled into theater when they exchange into fiat. 
c) 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation of early adopters have bought what their budget allow them to buy. Some are buying but more gradually. 
d) No major (good) news recently to create new demand from people who don't already have BTC. 
In short, more supply coming in, regularly, than demand going out.
Some will shout "Bubble! Ponzi! Airplane game!", but the fact is that we are still in super early stages, people buying now are still early adopters somehow (even if not 1st generation), using somewhat clumsy tools, and BTC has not reach its full audience yet.
Wait for some good news, from Wall Street or some country, or Amazon, or PayPal for example, and suddenly it will be in the media again, with some new positive argument, and a new cohort of buyers will want to move in.
**tl;dr:** Supply and demand, don't forget there is new BTC being mined constantly.

Problem is, as long as "we" let it exist, it gains some kind of legitimacy.
I personally would like to see something semi-official, validated by some recognized names among the Bitcoin community, formally reject any BF authority.
Until this happen, we validate it, and sooner or later, they will be involved in decisions and it will be too late to denounce them. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:13:34
Just a thought: you might want to consider using a threshold (maximum amount/time for free), to encourage casual users and become universal.
You know how some paid services (e.g. MailChimp) offer a free limited minimum first-level plan for casual users, while building up their paid offer for serious users?
It allows them to grow their user-base with small users who would otherwise feel they are too small to benefit from this service, and would skip it completely. While at the same time keep their main business intact.
Applied to your business, say I want to tip someone who doesn't have an account with you yet. First thing they will think is "nice but how much will it cost me?". If the tip is too small they might not bother claiming it, if it doesn't clearly say they get to keep all of it. Then, you're missing out on one active user. Might not be the most lucrative user, but they would be the wide base on which paid activity could grow.
For instance: imagine this withdrawal price plan:
Up to USD 9.99 per month: free. USD 10 per week and above: 1%
Not convenient for anyone doing real business with real withdrawal (they'd rather pay the 1% and be done. No real damage to your business for tiny withdrawals, but larger adoption. 
Just my 2 uBTC.

You misread me, and I apologise for being unclear. I do NOT think Bitcoin needs a foundation. I especially do NOT think it needs *this* particular foundation.
However, what I am saying is this: some day, when the UN or WTO or IMF or CNN or whatever, will need to ask some serious question about Bitcoin to some "representative authority", they will google it and find the self-proclaimed BF, who will then speak on behalf of ALL Bitcoin users(!)
I don't mind having people speak in my name, even if I disagree with them, but definitely not these guys...

Blackberry had a good run, but they forgot they needed to evolve, and not just sit and wait for competition to steal their users. If they learned to stay competitive they would still be there now. 
They all were in competition with something else. VHS, Friendster, etc.

Of course, I understand what is involved, and it was by no mean an attack to Coinkite (I really like what they are doing!)
What I mean is that I think there needs to be some outside-the-box thinking on that front, for that card to become mainstream, and not just a cool gimmick.
Say, for example, merchants who "buy" a POS machine get the price of that machine deducted from their fees gradually until it becomes actually free. Essentially, it would like a "subscription", allowing Coinkite to use that money to create and grow their business, and in the long term the POS gets reimbursed to the merchant.
Or, for example, merchants pay for a POS upfront, and get money back in one lump after one year, or after a certain transaction total amount. 
Just oversimplified examples, I know, but the key I think is to unlock merchants adoption until a) BTC becomes natural, and --more importantly for Coinkite-- b) Coinkite gets a strong hold on the POS market, and everyone uses one of their card.

Well, I'm not only talking about incentive for buyer to set price correctly, but more about merchant wanting to make sure the transaction is fast an smooth. Think of it like pre-stamped reply envelopes for example.
Imagine a transaction where recipient has to wait for hours because sender said "I'm not paying no damn ripoff fee". Recipient would think "I don't care about half a cent, I would have paid the fee myself if I knew sender was so ignorant and cheap"...
This way, it would simply be a way to tell sender "don't worry about the fee, I'll take care of it".

What is saying is that there will be a time where you won't have to change back and forth all the time, and now is only the beginning.
If you go to a foreign country once for holiday you might change that foreign currency when you come back. But if you plan to go back soon, you'll probably keep this foreign currency in a drawer until next trip. And you won't check the exchange rate everyday, because 1USD = 1USD and 1EUR = 1 EUR.
Similarly, merchants who receive payments through PayPal often keep their funds inside PayPal so it can be used for future payments.
Last example, your salary is paid to you in the form of a bank transfer or check. You don't always cash it all out into bank notes, because you can pay your utilities and rent directly from your bank account.
But you are right, BTC exchanges and ATM are often greedy, and we can expect market supply and demand to balance this out soonish.

Seems easy in theory, but it is a bit too complicated and technical for merchants who use Bitpay and Co.
My point is that most merchants would use Paypal or Square for their online shop!a credit card gateway because they are not tech savvy enough to deal with credit card processing themselves. It's quite normal. Bitcoin should bring them a similar level of ease, somehow.
EDIT: I understand it is only the beginning, of course. My question was more of a reflection on the future of BTC...
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:56:53
Nice idea. No need to force the algorithm, as it can be done "manually" by the user when creating the shortcut.
E.g., 
Actually, I posted a thread a while back about shorteners coming back very helpful for BTC addresses (via oral communication for instance), but their vulnerability to someone who would change the final address (the owner of the shortener even?)...
EDIT: 
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:28:16
Just playing the devil's advocate but, my problem is this one: what if you (the owner of the shortener) change the address AFTERWARDS (for example to your own account)? The end user will land on a blockchain.info address that looks almost the same as the original one and will not be able to see the difference... Because addresses on blockchain.info are anonymous, it would be easy to divert payments if you were dishonest.
So, how to make your shortener (links to blockchain.info) or mine (links to bitcoin: address directly) verifiable by the end-user and/or lockable by the creator of the link?

They can't even use a proper bot. They can't even set it up to spit out a 140 characters message. They don't give a fvck about actually replying, eventually, to the many, many messages mentioning them.

Bitcoin should always be presented as a big block of Parmesan cheese. You don't get "a bitcoin", you get XXX "worth of bitcoin". If newbies understand that, they appreciate its fractionability. It's a question of mindset, precisely because it is not a share or an object.

Based on recent BTC history, and considering the speed of development in a world still in its infancy, I think that by the time 1 BTC gets to be worth a significant amount, there will be plenty of new Bitcoin tools and systems created, comparable to what multisig would be to cash currently. BTC being digital the possibilities are pretty much endless.
That being said, I agree with your concern about everyone stashing cash under their mattress. But I am confident someone will find a way to profit from offering (some new form of) security services.

It has been "featured" (just now) in one of the largest communities (of one of the largest and most influential websites worldwide (reddit).
If you send me USD 0.01, I'll give you one share. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000 shares. Your investment will technically make this app to be "valued" at USD 10,000,000,000,000. Wow.

1. Use 2FA.

It's like you're saying "if someone asks for the time, tell them." Of course I explain to people who strike up a conversation about BTC, and I show them, and I offer to help so they avoid beginners mistakes. But as much as I like BTC, I don't have a weekly schedule, and I am not interested in all these coins being lost because they were given to someone who doesn't actually care.
Again, if someone asks, I answer. No need for a thread.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:18:26


Perhaps in the US where people are more litigious? Also, you seem to be talking about larger merchants while I am more worried about smaller independent shop owners. 
In general, BTC is like cash, and transactions in cash usually don't involve lawyers. However, PayPal account holders often have horror stories to tell... Credit cards seem to be somewhere in the middle. 


In the end, the consumer gets reimbursed, but having one's credit card abused can be a huge pain.
This is part of the discussion about "what does BTC bring, that credit cards can't already deliver?" and there is a lot that has been put forward throughout this sub. Ask the people who got their cards details stolen when Target got hacked if it made their life easier. 


Merchant doesn't receive money from credit card transaction instantly. The transaction is instantaneous but money only reaches merchant days later. If there was no chargeback in between...

@_date: 2014-12-04 09:17:15
Let's rephrase OP's sentence then: not buying USD n worth today is like not buying USD n worth three years ago. 
As you know, you don't need to buy n bitcoins, in 2011 you would have bought 20 or 30 thousands, and now you might buy 2 or 3.
(Just trying to clarify, not saying I agree or disagree with OP's magic 8-ball.)
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:41:27
I partly agree with your views, but where I disagree is that you seem to imply there are super early adopters whose wealth only rely on others to be sucked in. The real 1st generation early adopters did not get into BTC because it was a great get-rich-quick scheme, quite the contrary.
Those who are selling right now are not those who have had first hand experience to see the protocol go from "wtf libertarian geek magic money" valued at USD 0.1 per BTC to "Overstock announced they are holding part of BTC".
Some people, especially retailers are being cautious. It's natural and expected. Not every company jumped to paperless and cloud yet either. It takes time and experience to jump into a new disruptive tech. Many people are still printing their emails, many companies ban email attachments, downloads from the web, soft install, etc. 
But consider this for a second: most people who invested into BTC (buying some, mining, coding...) before it jumped to USD 600 did it because they see some value in the protocol and the system. Even those who bought at USD 200 to get rich did it at a time when everyone was saying "it's reached it's peak, it can only go down from here", because they saw there is more than the easy bubble marketing, and the protocol is here to stay, and it's only the beginning. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:49:18

Fairness and justice are easy to understand and to define, but in real life they are very difficult to interpret in an objective way. If they are abusing their privileges I agree with you they should recognize It and step down. However, the mere fact that it is you who complain about unfair censorship is a pretty ironic ouroboros that kinda proves their point, not yours.
This community NEEDS people like you. You OWE it to criticize BTC in a constructive manner, and provoke thoughts and balance. If you can't do it without trolling and being obnoxious, you need to step down.

This is why, as a first step, it would be useful to convince NGOs to act as intermediaries. You give to a reputable organization that transforms your BTC into goods directly.

What you mention about Japanese language is not actually relevant in this case. It's like an English language professor would NEVER in a million years, even angry and drunk, write "your wrong" instead of "you're wrong", simply because it would not come to him as a potential mistake to make. 1. Japanese levels of language don't work this way, 2. People who use a second language tend to have consistency in their language skills, 3. We are talking about an engineer/mathematician, someone who appreciate the importance of details.

N.B.: I am no lawyer, this is just my opinion.
If a person of color was coming into a restaurant and started shouting "This soup is cold! You served me cold soup because you hate black people?! This restaurant hates black people!!" And other similar reverse-racism just for the sake of disrupting what s/he sees as a "delusional white people community", s/he would probably get asked to shut up or leave. Not because of skin color, but because of disrespect.
If s/he continued shouting and received biased service afterwards because the staff would be fed up, s/he should not be surprised. Of course, PC people would say it is a race thing, and in the GRAND SCHEME of things it actually is -- because her/his anger came from somewhere in the first place -- but in this particular case it is just someone behaving like a jerk instead of enjoying a nice meal.

You'll see them back sometime soonish. But be patient, they are very slow. Then, move them away. And don't sell BTC into USD at MtGox either.

There are numerous tutorials online (even on this sub) to back up, duplicate, store on paper, etc. One of the beautiful aspects of digital is that you can back up duplicated instances of your data, this applies to BTC too. Online wallets are useful, but it's like carrying all your cash in your pocket all the time. If you want to save some money for later, back it up in multiple instances away from hot wallets.

My 2 cents: there should still be *some kind of* "scary yet approachable" security aspect that satisfy early adopters geeks (those who will promote your wallet to their less savvy friends), and makes newbies feel they are responsible for their money. For example with private key backup/export.
Hope I make sense.

If you think it is worth buying/investing/holding/using BTC and they would like to use some too, hold their BTC for them. Then, set up a light wallet for them and give them "pocket money" ad needed, while holding the rest yourself safely. This way, just like people learn about money, they can learn about BTC.

These were just "examples" for the sake of discussion. I am aware that Amazon is richer and can afford to invest more, but there is potentially an ENORMOUS business at stake, and if Coinkite does not take a real advantage, they might get overtaken by someone with more cash to burn faster.
Losing money on POS could be compensated by long term marketshare, and debit fees.
What they need now is cash to cover the cost of machines, which is not unreasonable, but in the long run, if they play their cards well, they don't *need* that money once things are in place and millions of users worldwide are using their debit cards everywhere (and other debit cards are also being used with their POS, earning them a cut of the fees). Long term thinking is crucial for adoption of a new device. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:27:38
Educate them yourself, this way you can also explain why it has value in the first place. Also, if you expect it to have value and go mainstream sometime in the future, you can just leave instructions that say "leave as is until you know what to do with it and how to do it properly", which would happen eventually.

Then, I give the address in phishing messages and recipients think it is legit. "Signed message" is even easier...

I think we are not talking about the same thing at all... Or did I completely misunderstood your comment?
What I am proposing is to be able to give a public address orally more easily than saying all the characters. Something you may need while on the phone for example.
To do that, I suggest the use of URL shorteners.
Problem: what if you use a short URL but the shortener's owner discreetly changes the destination address?
It was suggested that the shortened URL's keyword would be "easily verifiable".
However, it is not 100% safe because someone could create a fake address with the same first/last initials as the original one.

Day traders != enthusiasts != investors != geeks. Most people here *wish* they bought earlier, it doesn't necessarily mean that they would have sold earlier.
If you want to identify the people who would have sold at 10:1 or even 100:1, look for those who panic when BTC goes from 1000 USD to 800, or those who start buying when China buys and then sell when they here China is not buying anymore.

Please understand I am not against you, and I don't wish you lost money. I am just being as pragmatic as I can. I am angry at Karpeles for pissing in the well, but that's about it. But unlike many people who complained, I am careful to not take too big risks, and I don't blame others when I took risks and I pay the price of their consequences...
I have been reading (and writing) for MONTHS, to anyone who cared to listen, that Gox was NOT SAFE. And yet until the very last day before the blank page, people were still sending money to Gox in hopes of a good arbitrage gamble...


You seem to trollingly ignore the difference between "to be" and "to do/act".
Hypothetically, if you go to a pickpocket convention with a lot of cash in your pocket, you are taking known risks. If you go to a city where there is a lot of pickpockets on holiday and you don't read about the level of security of this city before you leave and you choose to keep a lot of cash in your pocket, you are still taking risks, but you choose to ignore them.


100% agree. But that is what BTC is about. No trust. No banks. That is the point. The goal of BTC is *not* "to the moon!", it's trustless no intermediary virtual cash. This sub was full of posts of people saying "don't leave your coins in an exchange", well before the Gox collapse. 


I understand your situation. There are several types of people. Some people, when many threads were complaining about stuck withdrawals and bad faith from Gox, chose to trust them, some other people decided to transfer BTC out (that's why the price of BTC on Gox was higher than everywhere else for weeks), some decided to gamble and try arbitrage.
Personally, when I am told "everything is fine, trust us", and I have my money stuck somewhere, I actively choose to extract it as soon as possible! But that's me.
People who lost money on Gox are in the same position as BTC early investors in general. Most of my friends don't trust BTC and think I am crazy. The might be right, I might lose all I risked. But I understand the risk, and I won't go to my friends for sympathy if I do lose it all...
BUT, even if I "lose it all", it won't be a big deal, because I know not to gamble with money that I can't afford to lose.
Again, I have nothing against anyone (except Karpeles), but I am not a dick for saying the same things BEFORE and AFTER Gox's collapse.

Largest but known for not being the most professional, repeatedly.
Also, there are more than one "bank" in this case.
Also, with BTC the point is that you can "be your own bank", or at least partially.
Note: I genuinely feel very sorry for this couple, but it is not correct to say people in this sub blame the victims, when all they say is "why keep all your savings in one place that many are abandoning?"

N.B.: I didn't mean to say "you're too young to remember" but rather "you may take for granted the Net today and forgot how painful it was at the beginning".
If you tried using BTC and you still think distributed online cash is not an improvement over bank transfer/wire AND PayPal AND Western Union combined, as much as email was an improvement over telex and snail mail, then really I can't say anything more to try to convince you, sorry.

Yes we are.
Remember when businesses started having their URLs on their printed/TV ads as a "novelty"? When easyjet.com had their URL painted on their planes? When Hotmail offered a web-based address you can check everywhere? When large companies had websites that offered nothing at all except the fact of being there, and didn't even hope to make any money, and yet they advertised them a lot?
All these helped the web to become "mainstream" in people's mind. My point is that mass adoption comes from the paradoxical point when mass perceives it has reached mass adoption, therefore it is safe and cool to jump in.
To reach this stage, it takes a fair amount of little steps from companies with increasingly bigger reach, and word of mouth validation at each step.

The real word should be "monochromatic". When you think about the History of the US and the History of white culture, there is a reason why some might want non-white people represented at the money authority board.

Not my software, but I used it before for simple and fast encryption of non-critical data, and I liked how light and user-friendly it was. Perfect for carrying on a USB key, non-tech family members, etc. 
It doesn't have all the features Truecrypt has (had?) but it might be a nice alternative for those who just want to add a layer of encryption to their data. 
I suggested the programmer to make it open source and he did, so I'm sharing it here and hopefully it is useful to some.

Thanks for somehow answering my question from the past (
Many BTC issues would be instanmagically solved (including better mass adoption) if it could somehow get back to solo-mining, with or without ASICS (ideally without, but I realise it's not feasible).

Agree and disagree.
As far as I know, BItcoin DID start like this. I remember free faucets with no strings attached not so long ago. Bitcoin is now in a different stage of development and evolution, and believe it or not Dogecoin helps Bitcoin as much as Bitcoin helps Dogecoin. Bit both should do what they do and not try to be the other one.
However, I do agree that for the sole purpose of showing newbies that they can have SOME bitcoins even if it is not ONE bitcoin ("too expensive"), it would be nice if there was more of this attitude when Bitcoin is in GE news.
Some will argue that 100 looks better than 0.001, but it is a good opportunity to use mBTC.

Take the "malleability" incident. Some exchanges seemed to be safe because they were professional enough to have prepared and anticipated the potential threat, and therefore not rely on it. It doesn't mean they are perfect, but let's say they "earned some trust points" because of that.
In the long run, there is more money to be made in becoming the next MasterCard/Visa/PayPal/Chase than there is in stealing some funds and risking the crash of BTC altogether. Most exchanges/services know that, and have their eyes on the big picture.
GOX is a special case because it was one of the very first and one of the biggest, and also one of the most incompetent (in general), so you can expect this perfect storm not to reappear for a while.
I understand your "far west/guns" analogy, but sadly you can expect that some people who lost a lot of money in GOX's crash will probably take matters into their own hands...

I don't think Wall Street will directly be helping BTC. But indirectly, when Wall Street will officially be into BTC, we may see new balance and leverage emerge. More lobbying and mainstream investing too for example.

Until the very last day, when all was blocked and collapse was on the front page in many threads, some people kept asking how to gamble more money into Gox to get higher rewards when prices would go back up. They KNEW full well.
Those who just landed on Gox after a Google search, obviously didn't know. But you have to ask then, why they sent their money to a company in a foreign country without checking that company first.
Some of them would not know how to look for such information (but they were savvy enough to find Gox in the first place?), but those who come to this sub to complain afterwards could have easily come to the same sub beforehand to inquire first. It was all over the threads that Gox was falling...

This has been addressed numerous times already:
1. Gox slowed then blocked transactions for months before talking about this "bug".
2. Gox had problems paying people's USD for months, before talking about a BTC to BTC "bug".
3. Gox issued a press release in which they blame the protocol instead of accepting responsibility for ignoring the "bug" and managing its potential abuses when programming their software.
4. By doing so, Gox hurt the whole BTC (eco)system. Some speculate that it is on purpose. 
These made people uncomfortable trusting Gox. 
Bitstamp did not do such things. This is why people make a distinction between these two exchanges.

I might be way off, but I naively think it wasn't expected to go this fast. We *should* still be at a stage were we "early adopters" still run nodes and solo-mine.
Things went very fast in the last year or so, which is encouraging in a way, but somewhat disconnected to rate of adoption by the "masses". Hence the strange uneasy feeling about specialized professional mining.
On a human level, even in Internet time, things are kind of going too fast to be smooth.

Keep in mind, I don't actively seek people who made a mistake and rub their nose in it. But some of the threads are just wrong, for the opposite reason.


Who didn't. If I never made any mistake I wouldn't dare being harsh about other people's. But that's somehow precisely the point: people should simply grow up, learn, and stop asking for strangers to bail them out...
When all goes well (BTC goes up), where were they? Did everyone give all their wins to charity? So suddenly, when they make a **mistake**, by not removing their BTC from an exchange that was accumulating management mistakes, we should all be sad for them? Sorry, it seems hypocritical.

It is still very volatile, and risky, and complicated to get BTC. But now it is easier than before. That is the first step. 6 months ago it was difficult, now it is not as difficult anymore. Little steps.

Quite interesting to see what the average curious people actually gets. Although there is a bit of bad faith on their part, as "research" would have been 10 minutes reading on the web, and finding a nice bar on coinmap beforehand.
EDIT: Considering they were already playing "good cop bad cop", it would have been infinitely more interesting and useful (and somewhat better for their own credibility) if they also incorporated the "dummy vs educated" routine, so that one could explain to the other common mistakes and misconceptions, like avoid the miner fee error, explain you don't actually need a full BTC, explain why cash is necessary as opposed to credit card, etc. so that viewers can learn and understand too. You know, like with a good show, where they add light when filming in dark places. 
&amp;lt;Devil's advocate&gt; He blames Robocoin's machine for the whole failure, but he doesn't mention which app he uses on his phone, which doesn't explain what miners fees are, nor adds one by default.
Also, they should go buy euros and then exchange back to dollars the next day, and see how much they lost in the process. That has nothing to do with BTC, and all to do with people who never used anything else than USD. &amp;lt;/Devil's advocate&gt;

Because GOX said so. Simple.
You can get in, you can't get out. Perhaps you will some day (that's why silly speculators keep coming in), and perhaps you won't (most people think it will die and everything will be lost). But for the moment, no spending, no withdrawal, no transfer.

Confidence and trust take time and effort to build, and are easily ruined by carelessness. "Fool me once..."
The community can be constructive, and supportive, but we are at a stage now where it is difficult to forgive bad behavior that damage BTC in general.
Shrem left the Foundation because he didn't want to hurt it. Most people were not so aggressive against him, as far as I could see. Karpeles on the other hand blamed the protocol for his own incompetence, and hurt the BTC image a lot by his behavior and words, or lack thereof. With great power...
Remember, it's supposed to be the Wild West now. Be your own bank and all that. Some people are serious about BTC, and they know "unregulated" means there will be abuse. They can understand mistakes are only human, but it doesn't mean they let it slide and forgive dishonest people. To be frank, I'm amazed Gox survived for so long and people still trusted it until the withdrawal suspension, considering their history.

Actually, they also do have a "new paper wallet" function, which is different from the export/backup tool of your actual full wallet/account. The paper wallet created then are added as "watch only" in your account. These are the ones I am talking about.

I agree. A bot could be set up to simply tip a third party on behalf of the person being tipped: I like your post, I tip someone who needs it on your behalf. Just need to identify how to set up the recipient (this is the hardest part, I understand), but my point is that there should be some Sean's Outpost to take care of helping redirect, otherwise it will be just a huge amount of work for each individual tip...
With this in mind, I'm thinking the best move should be to approach NGOs. It is not businesses we need to convince, once people see there is a profit to be made they will convince themselves. However, for karma, and PR, and Bitcoin growth, NGOs should be accepting donations in BTC ASAP. 
P.S.: There are also very poor people much closer to you than you think, in your own country.

Not JUST Google or Apple. But definitely not *anybody big* either. IBM, I could see it happening. In my very humble view, I think you'd need strong tech cred, to start anything credible. A company that would be believable if they said "we implemented strong encryption" for example. I can see the MIT successfully doing their altcoin. But I think GAP or NIKE would need to team up with some strong tech firm if they want enough trust to actually gain mass adoption (as opposed to mere curiosity).

@_date: 2014-01-14 05:38:55
I think people who donated did it for "the greater good of BTC promotion", and perhaps some would rather see the BTC back if it is not used (especially since value increased a bit recently), but they would prefer if the money was *used* for something good.
For example, I am thinking something to do with lawyers, à la EFF perhaps?
In any case, I'd say you're responsible for a valuable reserve that could become very useful in the future for the BTC community, you should consider it like a piggy bank for bad days and just let it be.

Yes. If you lose your phone you need to reset the whole thing. (**IF** it is possible!)
Gmail can sen you a code by SMS if you registered a number. It also gives you emergency codes that you can back up **in advance** to prepare for such an event.
Also, you can deactivate 2FA and re-activate it, which will generate a new code that you can back up.

In an ideal world, people would see the difference between right and wrong and debate the benefits of things they dislike. I agree. It happens between friends and in small groups of educated people.
But you disrespect order and then you say order should respect you. It's a bit paradoxical at best, and hypocritical if you ask me.
I like order and respect. I like things that work smooth. I am an iPhone guy because I am not attracted to the chaos of Android openness even if I see the value of it and I am glad it's there. For this reason I like to hang out in moderated forums rather than say 4chan. But because of that I try to participate in a constructive way, even when I disagree, rather than attacking people and then complain that the system should be changed. Perhaps I'm "too old for this shit" I don't know, and I hope I don't sound too condescending, but I want to say "get your shit together and join the conversation, instead of trying to break it.

Officially, they're there in case there is a need for some representation, like if a government needs to ask for an "official" position or something. I suppose when there was the hearing in the US they helped and in general it helped they were there. Maybe.
I wish some of the big names of BTC not represented by the foundation would start an official public Bitcoin Manifesto that clearly states they do not recognize any authority to the foundation. Public BTC-related people and users could then join and sign the manifesto too. Precisely so that it anticipates the scenario you mentioned.

With Bitcoin, you can create a zillion of public addresses. If I was this extortionist, I would create address1 for recipient1, address2 for recipient2, etc. because it is as free and as easy, and would allow me to 1) easily identify with 100% accuracy the origin of the funds received! and 2) make sure each address cannot be linked to more than one extortion.
The fact that they use labels in the QR, instead of separate public address makes me assume that they are grouping all incoming funds into the same address, which seems to me like they are not using Bitcoin to its full potential.

Quoting &gt;When I use my credit card I get charged interest on the purchases
Many people have debit cards, which are more secure (can't overcharge) and faster, but are not as well accepted, especially on international transactions.


This, x1000. Target incident is the most recent well-reported case. But **EVERY TIME** you give your credit card details over the phone to an underpaid employee of a hotel or rental car, you are basically *giving them the password to your credit card*, effectively allowing them to spend your money, or worse.
I can't believe this is still considered "standard (safe) practice". The only reason why it can still happen like this is because credit cards and PayPal charge a lot in fees and spend a large amount of that money in reimbursing abuse. Fix this, and fees could get lower.

@_date: 2014-04-24 16:50:27
I agree. But the positive way to see this, is that merchants (who already accept credit cards) don't have to do anything and they have one more source of payment available. Then, when/if the debit card (and it's little sisters) get popular, merchants will be used to seeing BTC as a "normal" payment way, and will be able to compare providers etc.
Chicken and egg.
Hopefully xapo or their competitor (Bitpay can't be too far behind) will soon offer options for merchants to benefit from accepting BTC somehow.

Chicken and egg argument. I would like to say that precisely BECAUSE consumers are *overprotected* they got somewhat spoiled and lost the normal instinct to protect themselves. When it comes to money, and *anything* for that matter, consumers need to **wake up**. By waiting for others to protect them, they implicitly give these others the right to choose for them what is good for them.


Finances must be simplified, not rendered so complex that you need professionals to take care of them for you.
Subprimes were not an issue of straight abuse, but rather due to delegation of risks and responsibility to others, by people who didn't / couldn't see the big picture. 


Losses were EVERYWHERE, it is a bit naive to focus on bank deposits when people lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, their businesses.
Something had to give. To keep things like bank deposits safe, everything else was put to contribution...
And what about bank deposits in Cyprus recently? Tough luck for these people?

No, **you** re-read it. He wrote "if (...) then it will be upvoted to the top".
In many places in Europe the minimum to buy with a credit card in small to medium-sized shops is usually 10-15 euros. Debit cards are sometimes easier for small amount, but usually not.
Many small shops don't accept either.

I think the reason why Bitcoin enthusiasts have a particular grudge against PayPal --even more than with fiat sometimes-- is because it was supposed to be the "money of the Internet", or at least it *could have been*, and instead it ended up being a big expensive "disappointment".

Yes, except that one of the benefits of BTC is that you can "be your own bank". If you start investing / saving a larger amount, you might want to NOT rely on someone else. Blochain.info is great, but they could fail in some way, and you don't want to trust anyone with all your eggs.

The money they got back was not created from thin air. Someone paid for it. More likely than not you or someone you know indirectly participated to the reimbursement.
In the case of Target stolen credit cards, even if money was not stolen, the ramifications can be more disastrous, such as identity theft for instance.
And the comment didn't mention the zillions of fiat users who get their cash stolen from bags, purses, pockets. That should add up to a nice amount.

I am not advocating some kind of quota, but merely saying "it's interesting that we notice this now, when only 25 or 30 years ago it would not even be a topic of discussion, like water is wet and the sky is blue". Going "too far" is unfortunately often the only way to get a little moving in the right direction. There is still a lot of racial tension in the US and in many other countries, the solution is not to force quotas, but to encourage what would make these quotas happen naturally (better education, for a start).
It's not about white guilt nor forcing an artificial balance, it's about making opportunities and overall conditions more fair for everyone so that the system can benefit for everyone. The world was not built this way up until now, but it's no reason to not try to improve it. 
Actually, as far as I know, the new chairman is a woman, and there are more than one empty seat on the board, so the "8 white guys" don't actually apply anyway ;)

You do not understand what you are talkjng about.
Problems about GOX, like not being able to withdraw USD, existed *MONTHS* before the malleability diversion.
The problem with GOX is that people are so focused on the latest excuse, they forget that users were already pissed off with GOX a ver long time before this "incident". It has NOTHING to do with malleability, and ALL to do with bad faith, hypocrisy, lies, lack of professionalism and balls, and excuses. GOX blames everyone but themselves because they want to buy time.
Other more responsible exchanges did NOT have malleability issues, because they acted responsibly. GOX pissed in the well and damaged BTC to save their sorry ass, fortunately BTC is stronger than their poison.

I understand, and I realise I didn't address your question precisely. So, more to the point:
You are comparing apples and oranges. The "black man" did not choose to be black, and his blackness does not invade other people non-blackness. However, the loudmouth disturbs other people quietness, and he is the only one who decides to be loud or not.
It an be argued that until not so long ago, "blackness" was considered disturbing by some, and some places would refuse black people altogether. It can be argued that it is still the case in numerous contexts, even though it is disguised or hidden. But the reason why it is being fought against is because it has no logical basis and blackness is not disruptive.
Being loud and disrespectful however is the definition of disruptive. Freedom of speech or not, respect others and don't abuse your rights.

I was kidding about the coffee break investment of course, and that was the point: they decided to spend based on what they could earn in return, just like a for profit company would do. It doesn't mean they want a 100% cash ROI straight away, but they probably scaled the benefit of offering Bitcoin payment over some conservative relatively pessimistic schedule. Now, they are saying it is better than expected.
Ice cream cost money and brings yumminess and smile. If they want to have less money and more smile, or just 100% smile, or a 50-50% money/smile ratio, what matter businesswise is the ratio. That was my answer to "He didn't say how much they were spending just that it exceeded their expectations".
Now to answer your question about my understanding of working with big products: I have, and I was actually paid to look at the big picture, which I did, and I still do in this case.

While you are technically and grammatically correct, let me explain it in real world terms:
Expedia had to make a little sacrifice to implement this. For example tech team spend their coffee break setting up the API.  They would gain a little back in marketing value, and the rest is a big question mark as to whether or not it was worth it or a big waste of time.
Many companies who spent a lot in setting up Second Life virtual branches back in the day painfully remember that not all investment pays off or even breaks even.
So, they made an estimation, risk/reward, if it would barely cover the cost it's not really useful, if it is a bit better it was worth it.
Based on this expectation, they decided to go further and try it.
Expectations have been exceeded.
TL;DR: More ice cream is better than less ice cream, no matter actual numerical figure.

Is there a way to set up a vote/poll on Reddit?
A few thoughts:
IMO, 1.0 could stay a "coin".
Personalities should be equally appealing to math/crypto geeks AND non-geeks. Non-geeks may not know them at first, but they should be easily convincing after a quick search to Wikipedia. Tesla is a good example I think.
As much as I like Darwin, it brings up the whole "atheist vs creationist" mood, which I wouldn't like to be associated to this.
Could be chronological order, leading to Satoshi in the end. The logic is that science kinda builds itself by growing from the work of previous scientists? This solves the "who's more important?" issue too.
EDIT: Easy way to get adoption could be to add names as keywords usable in bitcointip bot? Anyone reading this know its creator @_date: 2014-02-18 17:05:46

So far, the rate at which the overall number of BTC is increasing has been overtaken by the growth of interest from people, in general. As it is far from mainstream, we can expect it will continue this way for a bit, until in eventually becomes mainstream. Or not. Nobody knows.
Also, this only matters of you invest and hope price per BTC increases. If it stabilizes, it doesn't matter at what rate per USD it stabilizes, as 1 BTC is always = to 1 BTC.

If I am at a restaurant (a FREE restaurant, so more like a soup kitchen) and you are at another table in the same restaurant being obnoxious, I don't HAVE to talk to you, and the restaurant people don't OWE you anything.
Sometimes you are engaging in productive discussions, sometimes you are just noisy and disturbing. So, some of the other guests are moving away from your table, ignoring you, shouting back at you, etc.
The restaurant staff in charge of making sure things are smooth (the manager/bouncer) has a job: making sure people like me come back and don't just leave because of you. So he asks you to keep quiet, and stop bothering other guests.
To this, you react that the "world is unfair" and "it's a free country", and you sound like a drunk teenager...
So, they censor you.
Not because they want to pump some dark conspiracy, but because they want peace, I want peace, and basically you bring "noise" to an otherwise quiet and welcoming atmosphere.
I DO appreciate some of your comments. I do appreciate your snarky sarcasm. I do upvote your constructive non-sheeplike criticisms. But nobody needs a troll. It's that simple.
That being said, if mods censored more of the zillions of overstock/ghash, they would be doing a better job. Your comments are not as damaging to the community as the avalanche of duplicate shit that was.

Because the main point of friction is exchanges. That's where things get "complicated", "expensive", "delayed".
The more people can obtain bitcoins (or cash them) easily, the easier it becomes to use them.
It matters that it is not bottlenecked. It matters that it is not only something your bank can make happen during weekdays from 9 to 5. It matters that non-libertarian geeks can "try get some".

I was thinking the same way, super-theoretically, what would happen if Bitcoin becomes so popular in the next 20 years, that there are as many transactions happening as there are for credit cards today? The pool would still be enormous, but the probability of collision would grow nonetheless. No?

Reply to your open question, there is gold and there is silver and copper. There might be more crypto to come, but even if imperfect BTC seem to leave all other in the dust for the moment.

Its quite simple really, imagine that suddenly 0.01 USD is not called a "cent" or a "penny", but a "dol" or a "dolla". This would create confusion, even more so with Bitcoin where newcomers would suddenly see what they would perceive as a huge drop in value.
People for the change of unit value but against the word "bit" just want something that is different enough to be understood as a new unit, and could not be mistaken as a "nickname" of the old unit.

"Harder to sell" applies to stock market. With BTC it's different, because it is being mined all the time and its total is increasing constantly, and also because it is being used as a currency.

Overstock announcement is quite old (in Internet/BTC time) and would already be accounted for I believe.
There are good news these days, but nothing strong enough to make newcomers actually switch from "wait, the CEO of Bitcoin committed suicide just after going bankrupt??" to "Wall Street is getting interested, so it might not be as crazy/risky as I thought after all".
Think of what convinced YOU to get into BTC, from the moment you first learned about it and the moment you thought "I should have done that earlier". For the majority of people this moment will take a little longer and will require something more "obvious".
It's already amazing to me the amount of relatively positive reporting from reputable media sources, but what makes BTC revolutionary is precisely what makes it scary or at least difficult to approach.
It was the same with mobile phones, then a few years later with smart phones, not so long ago. And yet, not everyone has an iPhone, and not only because of money.

True, but unrelated to the actual problem.
N&amp;B did not "fail to deliver", like a bad investment without substance would normally do. It went from a "potentially good or bad investment" to a "has all the attribute of a scam" in a month or so.
If they lost all the money it would be a bad investment and your post would be correct. However, if the money was stolen by the CEO, even a solid business model would have meant nothing.
I guess what I'd like to add to your post then is that real world rules apply to BTC too. Not only does a business need to show some kind of plan if it wants to deliver, but also if it looks too good to be true, then it's probably not true.

Not even close to my logic. Dorian is the victim of a name he didn't choose, while the large majority of people who lost big money on Gox knew very well that BTC is a risky investment, and that one of the main selling point of BTC is precisely that you can "be your own bank".
To those who were trying to do arbitrage and day trading, and those who took risks, we can point out that they would have kept their earnings if the risks were worth it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. That's what risks are all about. That's why you don't risk what you can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:24:40


No it is not cheaper. Even with change. And the more people will *already* have bitcoin, the less they will need to change. Just like in banks or PayPal when you receive on one hand and send on the other from the same account, without the need to actually get the money withdrawn at any time.
Also, not everyone can send/receive from Western Union nor PayPal. 


Give it time. When mainstream merchants will adopt BTC, they are likely to give discounts compared to the PayPal and credit card prices, which are higher because this cashback and protection has a price. Many international buyers have experienced merchants telling them "we don't take Amex because they charge us too much", or "we accept credit cards, but we charge 3% extra". BTC is like cash, so it is cheaper for merchants to process than credit cards, let alone credit cards through a gateway like PayPal. Easier to set up too, means more small merchants worldwide.
Shady businesses? When was the last time you actually asked your credit card to block/reverse a charge from something you bought online? On the other hand, we read about credit card skimmers all the time.
And what about all the people who don't have a credit card? What about the people who can't buy something because their IP address is considered "potentially dangerous"? BTC offers the same protection **to the merchant** as cash, which means they open their business to customers who simply don't have the **choice** to use cards. 


If you want to know how much your coworkers make, in fiat, there are many ways to know. Or you can have a drink with them and simply ask. That's really irrelevant. 
Anonymity is **not** the main point of BTC (only Silk Road advocates and politicians are using this "pseudonymity" as an argument). However, like gold or cash, it is a discreet way to transfer wealth from person to person, without third party snooping, since it is sent directly.

And yet they keep getting a large amount of requests (according to your "spam" comment), so perhaps it is worth accepting it, if the cost of implementing BitPay is lower than the cost of dealing with all that spam?
Plenty of brick and mortar shops accept more than one form of payment, sometimes even more than one currency, yet it is not the bulk of their business. It's called convenience, and it's what many merchants think is part of their job.

Sorry if I appeared like a smart-ass or a troll, it was really not my intention.
I'm merely trying the paranoid devil's advocate approach because Electrum seems a very popular option, and we have recently seen with HeartBleed that we shouldn't take "impossible" for granted when it comes to computer security.
My point was not that there is not enough hashing, but rather that the single point of possible weakness is to rely on "random generation of a code made of a finite amount of items". Hope this makes sense.

N.B.: I didn't mean to sound like a smart ass, I will definitely watch them, and I admit I don't have fully complete knowledge of all of it, but rather I meant I feel I have "enough" knowledge to be able to explore possible changes ideas...
My main issue is this: as is, it's a great concept and system. However, the problem I see is due to specialised mining that is putting decentralization off balance. It's not really a "threat" because I don't think everything will collapse because of ASICS, but I do think its makes the ecosystem less "solid".
I wish some "non-competing mining" could emerge somehow, so that "creation of BTC" and "transaction validation" *could* coexist and be unlinked when needed.
Granted, I talk mostly theoretically and I ignore the current technical situation, because I am thinking about the BTC world of 10 years from now. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:46:11
When you can't buy anything with Bitcoin, either because no one accepts it as a form or payment or because there is no network of node to keep the blockchain updated, then Bitcoin will have failed.
If BTC 1000 = USD 1 like it did in the early days, it can't be called a failure, because the tech and the exchange system work.

Not because it sounded cool, but because I'm tired of that "protect me, protect me" attitude, which is precisely what shoots innovation and entrepreneurs in the foot. More anti-business anti-market laws is not a good thing. And if you need anti-trust laws to protect you from businesses, then you're no better than a little child who can't go pee by him/herself, hence the hand holding remark.
More regulation hurts consumers. It is supposed to protect them, but in the end businesses will be businesses (and crooks will be crooks), and the consumer ends up paying the extra cost. If you haven't figured that out by yourself, you need to take a step back and look at the big picture.
Class action against a bank can only backfire in the long run. Simply bringing your business elsewhere will make you happier.

Not completely true. In reality it doesn't matter if they keep it or not for the time being. For BTC to have "value", it needs to be useable.
Your credit card has no value as a piece of plastic, but has big value when merchants accept it as a form of payment. 
Whether merchants keep their credit held by the credit card company or get paid in USD in the end doesn't really matter to you. Similarly, if merchant keep BTC or not does not affect the value of BTC for now.
Next step, when merchants will be able to buy from their suppliers in BTC, so that they don't have to convert, it will be great for BTC value, but for now we are still at step 2. (Step 1 being users buying Gyft cards with BTC, to use on non-BTC merchants).

Do they take credit card payment?
You think they did A/B testing on Visa over MasterCard? They have internal staff working overtime to convert plastic payment into cash? Their accountants need to calculate the value of plastic vouchers tokens?
Sarcasm aside, if they can get someone to process credit cards for them and deposit USD in their account, they can get Bitpay added as an option. It might not make them richer instantly, but neither will snarky tweets.

Über could poll their drivers to find out how many of them would like to be paid (partly or in full) in Bitcoin. They could become the first "big" company who accepts Bitcoin without converting to fiat.

IMHO it's not that the only safe option is offline, but more about how we treat online security in general.
We are careful about so many things IRL but we still use the same machines to play online games, pr0n, and manage online banking. It shows how young/new our PC culture is, and suddenly having purely digital money forces us to look at it differently.
Look how the general attitude toward passwords evolved in the last few years. Who was talking about "entropy" 2 years ago (except geeks)? Where was 2FA? There are many examples.
Suddenly, online security is not jut someone else's problem. Normal people are slowly learning that their email account is something to protect.
Bitcoin is merely making things more obvious because it is on the edge.

One of the beauties of BTC is that you don't "hold" the coins, but rather you have the "code enabling you to spend" coins that are on the common/distributed ledger. This means you could use an infinite amount of ways to go around the ISP's filter to make BTC transactions. For example, with an SMS or email based service.

Well said.
I see the same problem with email addresses becoming the main username for all online services nowadays, changing it effectively into the weakest link, when it was considered insignificant until very recently. I am constantly explaining to my relatives and friends why it is super important to enable 2FA on their email, not for their emails sake but for everything else that it can access.
I do believe however that software systems are going to be developed more and more, to help people be their own bank while not relying on Coinbase and Circle.
On the other hand, in general, it is common that people like those you call "veterans" are willing to explore and test and break things, but when the technology becomes mainstream, people are going to expect fully functioning tech and will be careful with it. Not only talking about the Net here, but things like the history of computers in general, or even the history of motor vehicles etc.

My personal understanding of the Changetip plan:
1) get a lot of users everywhere, become the entry point to BTC for as many newbies as possible.
2) get a lot of VC funding to cover this for as long as it takes until the big buy out. 
3) get bought by one of the big guys (Google, Apple, Amazon...?) when BTC finally becomes huge and they feel they almost missed the boat, or one of the big BTC players when they can afford it (Coinbase, Circle...?)

You are sadly missing the point, like many others. Let me restate the context a little:
1. Gox took weeks, if not months, to transfer cash out to their owners, way before the malleability issue. People were angry at Gox WAY BEFORE the announcement.
2. Gox blamed the protocol, about an issue known and documented for years, which they sloppily neglected. By doing so, they hurt the confidence in the network as a whole.
3. People didn't say Gox was lying about the "bug", but that they were lying by using the bug to cover something bigger like their possible unsolvability.
1+2+3 combined is pretty big, and until this whole mess is cleared, Gox doesn't have to explain themselves because everyone is too busy to look at them...
Soon, expect more Gox threads when things are patched and people still can't get their USD nor BTC out of Gox.
Note: Some other exchanges were as negligent as Gox, while others were more diligent, showing that malleability can be dealt with and it is not a protocol bug but rather something you need to prepare for when you know what you are doing.
EDIT: Please UPVOTE this thread, not because you agree with it but because it needs to be clear and known that you disagree with it. Thanks!

If you already know what is in my mind, why do you ask then?
I spend time and effort writing sentences with words in them, read them carefully please.
If an altcoin replaced completely Bitcoin, meaning that people do not use BTC anymore, like other browsers  replaced Netscape, which replaced Mosaic, then Bitcoin would be dead. It would be the origin of something that lives on obviously, but as such it would be dead.
If someone found a critical flaw that makes Bitcoin unusable, and no one would ever touch it again because its impossible to keep or store or transmit value, it would be dead.
But if Microsoft share weirdly goes down to USD 0.01 tomorrow because Bill Gates starts a new tech company, it *doesn't* mean Microsoft is dead, neither as an investment nor as a company.

Good answer, except you are basically saying the same thing as the person you are replying to.
Anyway, in the case of a startup like Changetip, what they want NOW is more users, in general. Think YouTube pre-Google. They want to be perceived as valuable by VCs with their growing network.
What Bitcoin users want is more widespread adoption and understanding of Bitcoin.
At this precise moment it's a good symbiotic compromise. We'll see what the future bring, but there is a fair chance Changetip "social network" will be as difficult to monetize as other more successful ones like Twitter's for example.

@_date: 2016-06-30 15:18:29
I misunderstood your point earlier, I thought you meant a card where BTC would be converted at moment of purchase (like xapo does, if I'm not mistaken), as opposed to converting to fiat when you deposit BTC to credit your account (as many others do).
I would be very interested to know about a card like the one you describe. But then I wonder what would be the point since I could simply use my phone's wallet to send to merchant address without a card at all. ??

If you (and only you) don't hold the private keys, you don't hold BTC but merely a promise. Any wallet asking you for your email address to create an account is not a wallet. I like exchanges as much as the next guy, but I want my wallet to be holding my private keys.
Breadwallet is easy and straightforward, open source, HD, and your BTC is independent from their services in case they get hacked or go bankrupt for instance.

Glad to read I'm not the only one who thinks this way. It's easy to think it is kind of becoming mainstream when we are accumulating hours after hours of experience and information gathering, but the reality is that even my geek-inclined friends who know about Bitcoin and are reading more and more about it in mainstream media these days, still don't know how to get any, how to store, how to secure them, etc. and the non-geeks almost feel like I am walking them through an early stage DYI Apple I computer...
To get back to the Internet/web analogy, we are perhaps at the 2400 bps modem stage now?

This is why I suggest the convenience of going through Bitpay, although it costs a little fee. However, I don't think many people would go through the trouble of a double-spend to save a cab fare, but I may be mistaken.
My rule of thumb is no confirmation until USD 50, one confirmation until 500, 6 confirmations over that. Am I being too naive about the difficulty to fraud?

No payment cancellation possible, lower fees, only need a mobile phone to receive, among other reasons. But mostly, why reduce the options available for customers to pay? Many cabs still don't take credit cards, which puzzles me greatly.

I might be missing something, but the way I understand it is that a fork comes from the same chain, where suddenly a part of the community (nodes, miners...) stops recognizing certain transactions and branches off. A fork in the road forces you to drive your vehicle left or right to continue. Whereas Bcash came out of nowhere and coins were not even available for transfer/transactions at first.

Imagine a fork in the road. There is one road, then there is two. Now imagine a road with vehicles on it, and someone builds a parallel road and puts a copy of all the same vehicles on it, then instead of the original name "road 66", calls it "road 66 faster". From there, the road takes another trajectory, officially as the original architect intended. Is it a fork? Is it a copy? The vehicles on the original road 66 are still on road 66, the vehicles on road 66 faster have been created out of thin air suddenly.
Bottom line, premised altcoin. Perhaps it can be debatable if it is good or bad, but definitely an alt trying to create confusion by usurping the name. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:21:13
The people who created Bcash usurped the word "Bitcoin" to claim that it would be the real true only Bitcoin and that they could drop the "Cash" when the older branch would die off.
Calling myself does not make it relevant for me to speak in your name nor claim your house and your friends.
Calling Bcash "Bcash" is simply a way to acknowledge that there was no fork, and it was simply a premined altcoin like there are many others.

Say I have 10K or 100K set aside on my savings account, and I want to "invest" in something SHTF-worthy. I certainly don't want to fill my basement with guns and ammo until S is already slightly HTF a little more than it is now.
For now, I would probably get gold or silver, which I might use to buy guns and ammo when life is starting to get harder.
Also, water, candles, matches...? How far is SHTF?
Bitcoin is a practical alternative to that gold and silver step, I suppose, if you don't expect the grid to go down instantly.

I don't mean to say your students are stupid, but there are clever and educated, Bitcoin-savvy people, who have lost their bitcoins because they made mistakes. So, you could make it a challenge/puzzle for them to explore and understand by themselves, but at the same time make sure you are monitoring their steps.
It's only one buck, but if it is lost it is lost completely and forever. I think the first lesson to learn is this. 
Also, for your students to swipe their paper wallet in, I'd recommend HD wallet like Mycelium on Android and Breadwallet on iOS, because they can easily learn and backup their seed phrase. And for those who don't have a smartphone, they can simply keep the paper wallet (providing they trust you to not steal their funds back from under them), which also teaches all of them that in the end the bitcoins are in the Blockchain and not in their paper wallet nor in their phone. 
Anyway, great idea, but please make 200% sure it is legal and that your school and the parents are ok with it!
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:26:13
Agreed, on principle. Except if you are Greek you have a risk of losing 30% instantly, on money you can only very partially withdraw, after waiting in huge lines. Then, you have to keep that money under your mattress so anyone can steal it. Meanwhile you can't buy an app for your phone because your credit card is blocked too. With this in mind, if I was Greek, I'd choose BTC volatility risk over politically-imposed bankruptcy anytime. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 11:22:43
Thanks for the precision. Stupid specific question but, is Getgems open source as well? Are my private keys stored in my app on my phone, or on my account centralized at Getgems, or on their own account à la Changetip?
In other words, a) can someone run away with my coins? And b) when I send to one of my contacts does it get into the Blockchain or is it a Changetip-type of transaction?
(Come to think of it, Changetip and Getgems buying each other could be an interesting fit.)

1) Install Breadwallet.
2) Backup seed. 
3) Fill with BTC destined to cold storage. 
4) Verify public address(es) balance online. 
5) Log out from wallet. 
6) Start new wallet. 
7) Backup new seed. 
8) Fill with hotwallet BTC. 
(Even better, steps 1 to 5 on an iPod touch or an iPhone with no SIM and never connected to wifi.)
When needed, restore "cold storage" through seed.

Rich enough to care about the solidity of Bitcoin, one way or the other.
I can't personally afford to spend thousands of dollars to play this game, but someone who can either a) wants it to break and doesn't care if it costs a few thousands, because it is a threat to much more, or b) wants it to resist because more would be at stake if it failed, or c) is so rich and bored that it is just entertainment.
I doubt it's (c), so whether it's (a) or (b) it could be argued it's actually good for Bitcoin™

In my reply, I was merely pointing out that you mentioned the word "wallet", meaning a relatively lower amount used for carrying and paying, not for larger and longer savings.
Actually, I was recently wondering about using something like Breadwallet as a "fake" cold storage option. 
Some will argue that for long term cold storage, you want a proper **offline** solution. This means Trezor, paper, Electrum, etc.
In any case, for long term *and* short term, you want to avoid being dependent on someone else. Of course, as you know, if you don't hold the private key, you don't hold your coins, you merely have IOU's. So, you don't want to keep your savings in a web hosted service. But I would also add that you don't want your coins held in some proprietary system that may go offline at any time, for whatever reason. Recently, Circle was running a promotion and got their service jammed by new users, making it impossible for existing users to access their funds. Or, you know, Gox.
Personally, I like that Breadwallet does not work by connecting to a central server, unlike BC.i for example. I think we will see more of this type of apps in the future.

Google "Bitcoin ATM" and find a machine close to your location, or to the location of someone you trust who could go for you, then transfer them to you instantly (and you can pay them back later).

He meant that moving money faster and more efficiently is possible through crypto, which puts BTC users into a unique position to potentially send funds directly to local entities, better than if it was with fiat through the usual banking system.

Remember the first rule, and teach it to newcomers too: If you don't hold the private keys, you don't own your coins. Someone else owns them, and all you have is an IOU.
Coinbase could be hacked, or locking your funds because of new regulations, or blocking your account because of a dispute. You need to have your coins in your own wallet. 
Breadwallet is the app I recommend, for your iPhone or Android. Many people here recommend buying a Trezor if you have a lot of XBT to store and protect. But in any case, NEVER store your coins in a web hosted service.

Understood and agreed. For the sake of clarity, I would like to point out that my question was to theoretically discuss a simple no-hassle way to think of existing software bringing Bitcoin one step closer to the masses. Not saying it should be everyone doing it, yet, but just discussing how someone who understand things better can introduce the concept to less savvy people. Eventually, things will be simple enough for "the masses", but you have to agree that with Coinbase/Circle and Breadwallet/Mycelium things have moved forward quite a lot in a very short time, making Bitcoin much more approachable by non-tech people.

Then, perhaps you want to restore a blank new OS on the phone, no SIM card, no other app installed, and wifi and Bluetooth turned off as soon as you installed Breadwallet.

Do you already have a wallet? If so, get your *receiving* public address (the long string of characters that starts with a "1") and simply send from Changetip to that address.
(If you don't have a wallet yet, and you have an iPhone, I recommend the Breadwallet app.)
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:16:14
Remember that if you don't hold the private key, the bitcoins are not yours, and you merely hold a promise from the holder. So, if you plan to change all the bitcoins they send you at once, sending directly to your account on the exchange is fine. But if you plan to keep some bitcoins in the Bitcoin form, it's safer to keep them in your own wallet such as Breadwallet first, then send to the exchange only the amount you want to change.

Open your Bitpay / Copay / Breadwallet app, get the "receive" address, should start with a "1". Copy it. Paste it as the recipient address to your Coinbase. Send a little amount to test. There will be some transaction miner fee. You are "sending ownership" of the funds from one address of yours to another address of yours. Except now only you are responsible for it.
If you're ok and the coins have been transferred properly, repeat the operation with the rest of your funds.

Back in the days, Google used to rent out their technology to Yahoo! as their main search engine. Yahoo! was a portal and a directory, and by paying Google for the license to use their tech, it allowed Google's own homepage to run fast and uncluttered by ads and such. Granted, this was genius on Google's part and might not be an available option to all startups.
Bonus: Later on, what made Google's fortune was loosely based on Yahoo!'s own ad system, which they never managed to get to take off themselves.
EDIT: Not really a proper answer but what is in it for the developers? If they don't do it for a revenue now, they do it for the fame and glory, or the hypothetical revenue in the end. So, there should be some UX/UI designer somewhere with the same attitude towards a good project, but to get her/him to commit, they must become a partner, not an "employee", obviously.

The correlation is that you are saying now, 20 years later, that floppies were already obsolete, when in fact at the time everyone except a rare few geeks were comparing Jobs with Mussolini. Read the article, it is an archive, not my interpretation. 
My experience is this: I sometimes evangelize the concept of Bitcoin using Breadwallet, and I simply explain bits. It takes 10 seconds. Actually, it gives me an opportunity to explain that BTC is like flour and can be counted in ounces or grams or kg or even tons, depending on the context and the needs. Then, it also allows me to introduce the concept of "50$ in Bitcoin", as if we were paying in gold or in a foreign currency. Usually, people appreciate and even enjoy this parallel. 
To be perfectly honest, I admit was a little put off at first because I didn't see the point of bits rather than mbtc or satoshis. But I realised it makes sense, it's not just "arbitrary", and I got used to it very quickly anyway.

TL;DR: The big difference with (almost) any other open source project is that this one is directly about money.
It's not just a piece of software: we are deep into the Gold Rush. People involved, at all levels, are serious about their own money (and money in general) and even when they are talking theoretically, they know that we are not playing with matches but with people's actual wealth.
Everyone comes with their own motivation and beliefs but understands that it is about real money in the end. 
Greed threatens and tries to corrupt Bitcoin, but it won't necessarily succeed because everybody is getting more paranoid and checking everybody else, which makes the whole equilibrium more uncomfortable and painful, but also stronger. The more it goes, the more value and power Bitcoin gets, and the more greed it will create, and the stronger it will become.
Or, possibly, break and die.
When I discuss with skeptics or devil's advocates, this is what I put forward as perhaps the biggest and most powerful feature of Bitcoin: the same way miners and Bitcoin users cannot be separated because they are complementary and support one another, there is a balance in the project because for many money is at stake.
To skeptics who ask me "can it be broken?" I usually answer it's of course not impossible, but that there has been many people trying to destroy and/or crack Bitcoin, and the more time passes and the more money is involved, so there is even more people who want to break it, with various motives, and also more people who would rather make it stronger to save their own interests.

It's not a dumb question. You buy and sell your coins on Coinbase, THEN you "send" them to your private address which is generated by your wallet app. You don't leave your coins on an exchange or hosted service like Coinbase. If you (and only you) don't own the private key, you don't own your coins, and all you have is credit.

@_date: 2017-05-27 09:06:19
(Slightly oversimplified answer) In order to be safe, you and only you need to hold the private key. And you want your private key to be generated with the highest level of entropy. You want to keep it somehow away from malware. Usually, it's a better idea to go with hardware or at least proper phone wallet app than an online hosting service. Even worse are exchanges.

I'm not going to say "this is actually good", however I disagree with your conclusion that it is bad for Bitcoin, and here's why.
Sure, it is bad that media will use this news and make newcomers scared. But in all ecosystem you need some healthy balance for it to thrive and get strong. In a forest for instance, you have the parasites, and the bacterias, and the accidental fires, and the predators, the scavengers, together with the bunnies and the deers. 
Remove one or several categories entirely and the whole system will probably collapse, or at least gets fragile and vulnerable, because everything is "useful" for the overall balance.
The USD is strong partly because it is the money of choice for low-level and white-collar criminals around the world, as well as legitimate businesses.
The fact that thieves steal BTC through online drug markets, or crypto-lock malware actually **is** good for Bitcoin in the *very long* term, because it is what gives it that so-called "intrinsic value".

Address reused for receiving only, from myself, as a cold storage, should be fine, when it comes to privacy and security, no? From what I understood, it's mostly sending from the same address that can be an issue.
Regarding spending, the method described was for no-hassle long term storage, not for everyday use. But the beauty of HD wallets is that once I decide to not hodl anymore, I can simply reinstall Breadwallet and restore my seed, then start spending normally...

Good for you, I wasn't, but fortunately I could read. 


At the time, it was in BIG trouble...
Wired published "101 WAYS TO SAVE APPLE - An assessment of what can be done to fix a once-great company" a year before.
This is how they opened:




I think you are not really understanding what I am trying to say here: it is easy to look back and say floppy were obsolete, NOW that they are. But at the time, they weren't. And at the time, people were even saying APPLE was obsolete.

I think you meant to write "Breadwallet, the most popular and recommended iOS wallet"?


I think Breadwallet simply refuses to be bullied by old-school soon-to-be-obsolete pseudo-rules. With your way of thinking, bits are also "perfectly valid", and if you don't realise that it is a non-issue, you fail to understand this particular advantage of Bitcoin. 


They have not seen the future, but judging from your inability to remember the past (even when I copy-paste it for you), I can understand your confusion.


Everything is relative. The uproar in the iOS Bitcoin community is very real, look at what you wrote earlier...
Again, Breadwallet is open source, if you want to make one version where everything is the way you want, you can. If you would rather trust and respect the people who built it in the first place, perhaps you want to give them some credit for kinda knowing what they are doing?
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:41:12
I was thinking the same. And for "cold storage" OP could even do this: 1) Install Breadwallet, 2) Write down your seed, 3) Transfer your BTC to your public address, 4) Erase app from your phone, and keep the seed in one or more secure places. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 04:48:10
Actually, that was the point of this post. Why not?
I mean, theoretically, how is it more unsafe to
a) install an app on a clean new iPhone to get a recoverable seed and an address, then uninstall it,
b) install Electrum or bitaddress.org locally on a Tails booted PC?

When some government manages to eradicate either a) hard drugs or b) tax evasion or c) illegal immigration or d) illegal copying of copyrighted material, in their own country, maybe they have a chance to make Bitcoin disappear there as well, but it will only mean Bitcoin will be available in all neighboring countries anyway.
If these can be stopped worldwide, then it means we finally live in a dystopian sci-fi novel, and then perhaps they have a chance to block Bitcoin entirely worldwide. Good luck with that though.

I didn't like this symbol at all at first, and I didn't like using the word "bits" either, but then I realised I didn't really care, and it's there and easy to use, and not used anywhere else. And I got used to the logic of bits being a millionth of a BTC with 2 decimals.
Now I'm using Ƀ and ƀ respectively, and I honestly wonder why I didn't want to use them before. :)

Until, you know, supply and demand. And if it does go down to $20 I'm not worried that a few people on this sub will buy enough to get back to $100 quickly anyway. 
Also, personally I don't care if it goes to $20 for an extended period of time, because it would make it even stronger if it could go down so much and still not die (= go to zero). Beside, OP asked about worthlessness not lower value in general.

Many people with whom I have discussed about Bitcoin in the past have said something like "but, since it is disruptive, what if the government makes it illegal?" or "since it is used (mostly) for illegal purposes, how will legitimate business want to be using it and get associated with it?" There is a misconception somewhere in the general public that if something is tainted by bad people, good people won't want to touch it.
@_date: 2016-07-02 11:21:02
I think many people agree with this point of view. However, it is not too early to make people aware of what it is, what it brings etc. because it is not seen only as a ponzi or a crime-enabler anymore, and the discourse in mainstream media has evolved a lot in the last year or so. Therefore, it is probably a good time to make mentions of Bitcoin more "normal", as people start getting used of it "being here to stay".
@_date: 2016-07-11 05:38:43
Well, paradoxically, one of the solid pillars of Bitcoin long term viability *is* that it is used by criminals. If you got drug traffickers and Russian ransom hackers on one side, and Wall Street and Silicon Valley on the other side, it is virtually impossible to go to zero, because there will always be someone whose interest is to keep it running. And as long as it is running, even if it goes back down to 1  USD per BTC, there will be people using it to exchange value, which will attract other people to hodl and speculate on this value. 
Arguably, one of the historically defining moment for Bitcoin was Gawker's article on Silk Road, when suddenly a lot of people learned about its existence, and many like me realised there was a solid supply and demand ecosystem backing it up. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:30:42

Yes, but coins do not move from a location to another location. The way it works is that all the coins are always on the Blockchain, which is decentralized and distributed, and what get transferred is "ownership" or "spending rights" of the coins. In other words, when they are sent from one address to another, location of the owner of the address is pretty much irrelevant. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:04:02
I'm not saying that going from 600 to 20 would mean that it is getting stronger. I meant to say that if it stays alive at 20, it will show how solid it is as the vehicle of a market economy and not just pure speculation. If 1 BTC is worth $20 for the next 20 years, of course I'm not going to lie and I'll admit the hodler in me will be a little sad, but I'll also honestly say that the geek and the libertarian in me will be very happy and satisfied, probably happier than the hodler is sad actually.

So, by your logic, the heist perpetrators "created" *new* money out of thin air. The *original old* money changed hands, and was automatically replaced by the exact same amount in new money.
This means there is a multiplication of the amount that was "stolen". Bank customers can spend their saved money and thieves can also spend their newly acquired money.
That doesn't seem like a problem?
There is no loser in this scenario?
Insurance will just write it off?
Not trying to troll nor attack you, but the "it was all insured" argument doesn't really solve all problems. Insurance companies and banks don't like to lose money. Events like this eventually have repercussions on the little guys because for profit business.

If you (and only you) don't hold your private keys, you don't own Bitcoin, for example if you keep your bits in an exchange, you do not hold them but instead you have an IOU, just like at a bank, and they can do whatever with your BTC, including losing it.

Seriously, what's the point of vanity addresses? I mean, I understand the appeal for like 1 minute, but...
Not only it attracts more attention, and it encourages reuse, which is not ideal for security, more importantly, it does not make anything easier or better for users. 
I understand someone pays top $ for a short and catchy domain name, like bitcoin.com for instance, but this is the equivalent of a catchy IP address like 123.45.67.89, which is useless for almost everybody. 
If you manage to generate a vanity address in which ALL characters make a sentence, I could understand, but most of what I have seen was just a few chars. 
We need something like email addresses and domain names for simple everyday use, and I'm sure it will come soon, first half-clumsily embedded in wallets, then afterwards as a standard, compatible with HD address generation etc. We will probably have shortcut options just like we have for URLs. But vanity addresses are not even geeky, they have always been obsolete from the start.

I guess if they want to keep the white label as white as possible, they will try to protect their clients/partners by making it difficult to link them together. But I supposed someone would have found out a way to identify them anyway.
One issue I'd think would matter is if the hosting can be done by the client/partner or not. White label is often hosted by the service provider, which means US in this case, whereas one of the big competitive advantages of a new exchange would be location of data hosting. No?

I suppose that anyone who has a few bitcoins would, if they were told that it's the only way to keep them from suddenly have no value anymore...

No more incentive for miners to mine, and everything collapses (toward the 51% scenario). Or am I misunderstanding something?

Not exactly. First, it was not an "incorrect prediction", it was a "ridiculous yet very aggressively dismissive prediction". Also, the way it was formulated, it didn't imply "well, this is not exactly my area of expertise", but quite the opposite. Lastly, OP didn't say "Krugman is wrong every time" but "puts his thought into perspective".
Perhaps Krugman is brilliantly intelligent, but this 1998 prediction shows he was not very good at looking at the big picture to foresee the future once on something quite huge, and therefore his thoughts on Bitcoin should not be seen as gospel despite his Nobel.

I agree that it doesn't need to be Matrix-oriented. But the gold coin is confusing for 2 reasons:
1. People might miss the point of virtual, and think it is like gold, which you need to store, and carry, etc.
2. People are already confused with the fact that you don't need to buy a full BTC, and that it is like any currency. The gold coin reinforces that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:54:48
Two options I use:
a) Bitpay offers handy little tools that allow your customers to pay you a fiat amount that will automatically be converted at the Bitpay rate. Check out this pre-formatted page for example: 
b) Print a QR code of your destination wallet so that people can simply scan and enter the amount manually. Then, give them the BTC amount orally. You should mention which change rate you use next to the QR so that there is no confusion. (Blockchain.info is good. I thought of buying a cheap phone or tablet to display the rate live.)
I use (a) for newbies, and (b) for customers who are more comfortable with BTC. And for marketing. Disadvantage of (b) is that it's less smooth. Advantage is that you have a QR code already printed and visible, so customers are aware (and reminded) about BTC when near the register.

Markets are not an exact science, and even pros who do only that all day long can't safely predict anything with certainty. However, there is a technology, and a short but strong and eventful history attached with BitCoin, that make some people believe in its long term value. Along the way, it goes up and down, and people like to buy low and sell high if they can. I don't think anyone here claims to "know", but most people here are interested enough to follow and learn -- not finance, but Bitcoin -- as it evolves.

Thanks. I guess I understand the logic being that there will always be enough to earn for more than one miner to be interested.

Again, greed is a powerful motivator, but also creates unbalanced and fragile situations.

"A quarter of the world's population" does not mean "most".
In many of these places where electricity is not as reliable, they routinely use diesel generators.
You are right that not every single human being uses electricity the same way the average western country inhabitant does, but it doesn't mean they don't have access to anything either. Part of what is interesting with Bitcoin (to me at least) is the step toward some low-tech layer that would allow competition with (and/or enhancement of) Western Union for example.
