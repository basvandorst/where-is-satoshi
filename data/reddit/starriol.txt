Or... they haven't touched those accounts in 2 &amp; half years to makes us think that.
And after the go bankrupt, the dust settles for a few months, they start selling.

Darn, you're right

Hehehe, I got that reference.

Dude, I can sell you my account, it has about 400 dollars worth of bitcoin.
It's yours for 100, I just don't use it anymore. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:35:52
Pfff, you little man, I have around 0.456

Right now, he can't.

I DON'T KNOW!!! 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:58:43
So, how did this work? Did it change the address and you could see it or did it modify the httprequest?
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:08:58
Ahhh, OK, thought you could.
I was trying to be ironic, piracy and all that.

Those terms don't include taking as long as they please to process a transaction.
See their Facebook page, you have people outraged for the insane delay times.
So don't mention the TOC, it has nothing to do with anything I or anyone else agreed to, they are unilaterally deciding (or they can't do otherwise) to do this.

Saying someone didn't get infected in their whole life and concluding Windows is reasonably secure is like saying you've been driving motorcycles for years, never had an accident, therefore, they are safe. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:57:28
Sorry, but who are you or Mtgox to define what's important or urgent for me?
They can't make you jump through hoops for months to get your money out, when 6 months ago it was much easier.
I don't get why you guys seem to defend their unethical business practices with such a passion...
@_date: 2014-11-26 09:53:39
Well, but maybe is for reference only

They payed him EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS?
That's surely a marketing strategy, "Hey, we have so much money we can pay this guy that much". 
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:19:02
Wait wait wait, so you are saying you can actually buy Microsoft Software???
THIS is the real news! I didn't know I could pay for Windows!

Emmm... I shall not.
I still need my search engine to work
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:33:25
Yeah, it was a amazingly satisfying!
Fuckers now added an automatic service for this!
And don't even get me started on Linux, that due to its file system doesn't need defraging!!!
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:09:08
Ahhhh, I get how it works. You hash the whole tree once, which is a fast operation, and then the brute forcing takes place to find a suitable hash of the hash?
Now it makes sense! So that's the famous "proof of work"? Finding a particular hash of the hash of the tree, which is placed in the header? 
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:16:32
HE TRIED TO PHISH US, GUYS!!!

Sorry, I sounded a bit harsh, but are computer clocks really able to be synchronized to small enough fractions of a second?
I'm not familiar with NTP or similar protocols.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:46:30
You don't need coinbase to safely store your bitcoin.
But you do need a bank to store fiat. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:25:16
But... But... Future money... 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:22:27
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:05:35
Ahhh, got what you meant now! 
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:13:08
But... but... bitcoin is *WRONG*
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:27:39
Yes, but in this situation, both would be valid.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:21:34
But how can they sync their clocks to perfection, to allow that check to happen? I don't see the viability.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:36:51
That makes a lot of sense, thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:03:23
Yeah, I know it's a fringe case, but I enjoy breaking things, haha! 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:09:35
Great, thanks! 
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:21:03
That assumes that all bitcoin nodes have their clock at perfect sync, which is not realistic.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:27:17
Yes, I know, but my question is HOW it is decided which one is included. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:40:13
Ahhh, they invalidate each other because they use the same input? 
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:34:08
Ahhh, great, so what's how difficulty is set. Thanks a lot, you've help me clarify a lot of things. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:20:22
Is it allowed for them to drop transactions at their discretion?
Would other nodes compute the block, see a different hash and create a fork, drop the other candidate block or something?
Gets a bit advanced for me, but  I find it weird a node would be able to do that.
If it was the case, what would stop a node from saying it solved a block with 0 transactions and get a 25 BTC reward? That should compute must faster than a block with the real number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:18:42
Thanks for the thorough response!
So what happens if a miner broadcasts a block with 0 transactions, when there were transactions in that 10 minute time frame? They will stay at the pool and be added at the next (hopefully) block? Will they be discarded?


Are you saying that the block hash is not easier to compute when there are no transactions? I'm still quite fresh with Merkle trees, but from what I got from this graph, more transactions = more hashes to derive = more processing power needed:
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:02:18
Thank, I'll take a look when I get home
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:42:37
I guess they don't wait for confirmations. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:48:38
So... basically it means mining with GPU is a thing of the past for real now, right?
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:37:57
So... can someone explain to me how to convert WMX to BTC? I seem to have missed that (quite important) part.
Sorry if it obvious for everyone else, I can't see it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 12:01:13
Just a question, how are researchers supposed to get their hands on the BTC to pay miners? Most people don't know how to.
You should provide a guide.
Great idea anyway! 
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:29:45
Thanks!
