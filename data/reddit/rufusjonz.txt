As a sidenote, loved your comments -- but in some ways I like the non-profit feel of Reddit, even if un-intentional -- like Wiki, except that is intentional non-profit ...

10k is sort of the magnet price currently, it gets drawn back around to that - need a clear sustained break above 15k, that would be healthy price action

It should be bigger than the GDP of the entire world eventually, that's the principle of limited money supply + early adopters + basic pyramid theory...   (it actually should go to zero eventually, but that may not ever happen)
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:02:14
That is only about $6.5 billion too much ...
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:46:11
the divisible thing ... think about this ... how bad the children of the future will be screwed if this works (which it won't) ... what you consider the worth of 1 bitcoin today, your great great grandkids would consider that the worth of 0.0000001 bitcoin ... that is the exact opposite of normal currency movement (in our grandfather's day a candy bar was 0.01 and a movie was 0.10 for example) ...  its just a pyramid that benefits the early adopters and the present day at the expense of the future
(example) -- you might find a 1 bitcoin on your old blackberry in 50 yeasrs and it is worth more than 1000 people make in a year?  that's just not right, especially considering how much ripoff and scammery is going on currently
like i said it is more like diamonds than gold if you were to compare it to a real world commodity, because of the (in my view) illegal manipulation of supply of diamonds and control by a few large corporations -- but gold and diamonds are both considered valuable and precious in terms of beauty and in trade for 1000s of years , and are real things -- some people paid $5k for World of Warcraft accounts a few years, and they may have been worth that at one time, but they don't hold a lasting value like gold and diamonds have proven to
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:06:26
you kind of make it more sound like gold than a currency per se -- so in that case, gold has had a value for 1000s of years, what value is there in bitcoin other than perception ... and if the feds and every agency start going after it, who would want to be associated with it?  i wouldn't
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:14:07
in my view it is going to 50, 25, 10, 5, 1 and possibly 0  - (i have no position or interest in anything related to bit coins)
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:59:10
more likely they will just pull a couple of their lobby strings and get it all shut down - any biz 80% associated with illegal trading (and much of the rest is just techies trying to get rich) could go at any time
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:35:56
I think I read today that the actual float of bitcoins that have ever been used in real transactions/trading may only be like 20% of the total amount -- the rest held by the insiders and early adopters who got in early on for basically nothing  ... that sounds to me like the basis of a risky pyramid that is likely to collapse.  So that 20% that is actually out there and being passed around ... if even 10% of that is traded on a given day, the whole market freezes up and collapses -- soooo illiquid.  And no incentive other than to buy and buy more and hold for speculation.  It's just kind of a pipe dream with the limited supply and strict time limit.  Has anyone recently tried cashing out $100k or more of this into Dollars/Euros/Pounds in 1 transaction?  
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:50:32
can you cite me examples where people can cash out amounts over $100k into Dollar/Pound/Euro recently?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:42:00
can you guys tell me how to short bitcoin without dealing with a shady dealer or with the feds coming after me?  
the first panic selloff has paused, another selloff will begin soon 
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:08:12
it's your money, but like i said be very careful buying on the way down -- the websites of "exchanges" and "dealers" in it are already crashing and most will disappear into the night ... liquidity will dry up on the buy side, already down from like 140 to 115 when i started posting about it to 80ish -- see the obvious downside targets above
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:39:02
I like your statement about time is ripe to try something new.
That being said, just today I saw websites shut down from hugging, one saying 7 day delay for new orders, the biggest company with a price way off base with what other real-time prices were showing.  I saw the largest (by far, like 80%) market share user of the currency get raided by the feds and closed.  And that was for illegal uses, by the way.  Then its chat board went down.  Then reddit's chat board about that got taken down.  Not exactly confidence inspiring.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:22:27
based on my research, 86% of bit coins passed through Silk Road .. fcked ... sell sell sell while you can
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:11:07
I think you are deluded ... my guesstimate would be 1/3 illegal, 1/3 hoarders/investors/believers, 10% speculation, 1% legal goods/services, the rest kind of insider trading, scamming type stuff
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:08:09
you can't short sell it or buy put options on it (at least anywhere semi-legtimate) -- or i would do that right now -- i will short sell you some at 120 paper trade 
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:14:07
it is infowars ... but this could legit be Chase trying to crack down on suspected money laundering, illegal biz, etc

""Estimates Silk Road has processed transactions worth over a total of 9.5 million Bitcoins, which adds up to roughly $1.2 billion in sales."  -- that money is GONE and the part that isn't gone is being liquidated very quickly
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:09:42
the other 20% of it is mostly techies speculating and trying to get rich from an ipo

no ... 3 diff moves are referred to by the posted version of the title ... SilkRoad plunge, huge subsequent rally, new rapid sellloff

if i created a currency and 81% of it had been processed through only 1 bank or merchant, and that merchant was seized by fed and intl agents ... what do you think it is worth?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:09:16
tax the 80%+ plus of it that was once used for drugs, weapons etc?  source: 
i wish we could do that, but im talking real world where that stuff is illegal

this is turning into a movie before our very eyes ... Social Network meets Cocaine Cowboys meets Wall Street
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:55:23
and uncertainty in any market normally creates massive amounts of selling to safety ... and the uncertainty currently is massive in my view -- of course with the "limited" (some may say ponzi like) supply of the currency some ppl hoard it
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:28:41
here is backup from quartz.com -- around 81%

I want to short sell any of you some BitCoin at 120 ... you buy from me at that price, let's have a gentleman's wager handshake agreement.  If you can't afford to settle up when the time comes, you can barter a woman's favors for the losses you incur -- if you want to cash out profits, i will pay you in Captain Crunch or string cheese.

i guess you missed this line about diamonds: where a couple of producers attempt to strictly limit the supply each year in order to (in my view) artificially maintain high prices)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:56:43
in terms of revenues in currency and amount of total currency, yes it is a good analogy --see the article
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:27:40
ty appreciate it - ill turn down the tip though, not sure i want to be on the books just yet
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:04:50
do you think the Feds and Euro want a competing virtual currency that is basically tax and regulation free?   this is just the first step to entirely shutting this thing down, in my view ...
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:13:40
1.  Tesla is completely diff than bitcoin -- both are nice concepts but completely diff products 
2.  that coinmap is nice, but i see about 20 transactions or accepted places or whatever in the entire USA ... that's really not much, an average mcdonalds does 20 transactions in 15 minutes during lunch - legally -- are places in America charging sales tax on the bitcoin transactions, otherwise i don't see how they won't run afoul of taxing authorities (govt gots to get their money)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:11:29
with the feds and soon interpol and everyone else soon to be crawling all over this, what legitimate business will want to be associated with this fake currency or accept it?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:18:08
insignificant?  80%+ of bitcoins passed through Silk Road at one time or another ... the other 20% of it is techies trying to speculate or have ipos and get rich -- long term it is done ... sell now, more downlegs will come
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:19:30
make that 86%
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:57:07
ok so what % is illegal stuff, what % is speculators and what % is true believers ?  33% each? 
what % is people paying for legit goods n services -- under 1%?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:40:47
you make good points, but the USD and every other legit currency has an army and weapons behind it -- the BC doesn't (except for the weapons drug dealers and terrorists bought) -- it can be wiped out, and a new digital currency could emerge in its place -- one that is regulated, taxed, etc
also the market is so shady in this -- with no options, short-selling, real liquidity etc, it can collapse at any time and/or be manipulated constantly -- what legit businesses would want to be associated with it?  (other than techies trying to hit on a big ipo startup)
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:03:45
i traded millions of dollars of options in 2 diff countries, including in what was the busiest equity options pit in the world at the time

no it is gonna 
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:47:45
ok good points -- but you stick with your virtual gold that is actually a threat to major currencies (=govts) because it is not taxed or regulated (and massively associated with illegal activities) -- i'll pass on that wager -- i'd rather have playstation bucks or chuck-e-cheese tickets 
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:45:53
have you personally withdrawn any significant amount of money from there and received it?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:29:39
kroger brand "string cheese"
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:01:31
no .. **i'm asking anyone to show me where someone recently CASHED OUT bitcoins and received over $100k in real world currency into their hands or a real world bank account** ... or maybe they don't want to show it because the only ones who have done so are drug dealers ... 
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:03:15
it was and is ... mostly illegal trade (not my choice but the reality), the rest is purely speculators and techies trying for the next hot IPO, with some scammers thrown in -- not sustainable, virtual gold
one key is that there is no short-selling or put options to bet on a down move available (at least from anywhere semi-legitimate)  -- so the market is kinda rigged to go higher (limited supply) -- until it ultimately crashes, which likely began today, with more downlegs to follow
also an unregulated market of incredibly thin liquidity and extremely open to manipulation -- recipe for disaster
the govts of the world coming after it may speed up the ultimate crash to 1 or 0
i would paper trade short sell bitcoins all day at 120, and if i had any profits i would be cashing out NOW before the whole system collapses
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:29:53
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:27:44
 it is not a free market if the supply is limited and expires on a certain date
 beyond the philosophical concepts of a global decentralized electronic currency (which i tend to support) and the other belief points, many of which are valid - legit honest speculation/trading (with man's greedy nature) AND the increased usage of bitcoin to purchase legal goods and services both have to be present  for this to succeed in my view -- otherwise this is basically just collecting "ps 3 badges" or putting something under your mattress that you and 5% of the world think is valuable.  But being able to cash out what is under your mattress is extremely important.  In the options and futures world, there is a buyer for every seller.  Too many of you are just buyers i think.
