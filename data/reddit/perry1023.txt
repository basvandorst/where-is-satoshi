cool. not many are aware of bitconnect and I cringe when I hear BCC as bitcoincash and see the ticker on bittrex. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:42
BCH please. There is already a BCC. 
its confusing and annoying.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:11
what happened? it looked scammy to me too.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:14:02
how did you find out that information?
edit : found the article. 
next is 2/14
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:57:08
haha. I should have gone back and elaborated. I use authy and know that the backup prompt is real since I recently got back into crypto and forgot my backup pw. luckily for me I still use a backup iPhone and had authy loaded. I am making the switch to google authenticator since is is the most widely used platform.

Thanks for the post. GAW is a joke. They run the forums and sub reedits like NAZIs. Disagree- banned. Have a problem - banned. Don't like some thing? - Banned.
The business model is ever changing to cover the tracks. How can you mine a  non existent coin, convert it to a fake online currency and call it your own. Not to mention that it is mathematically designed to implode unto itself.

The bottom line is, if you’re mining, you’re mining. You don’t care about the price anymore. Bitcoin price is increasing. Today’s investment is tomorrow’s payoff. I quit momentarily in 2014 after the cryptsy, paycoin , moolah and dogevault “scams and hacks” . I got back in soon after and have made a killing. I believe in the core product and what it stands for . I dislike the ridiculous hard forks ( made me money) and the manipulation of exchanges. I’m in for the long haul.

Nothing to worry about. Most of the homes / apartments that burned down were confirmed to be stealing electricity by illegally taping into the system. Your set up is protected by circuit breakers. Just keep your set up cool by using a fan.
