try running bitcore (bitcore.io), it gives you a nice block explorer out of the box and you can also turn on its wallet service and point your copay wallet to it
also, we don't rely on good will for running nodes ...the benefit of running a full node is that you need to trust no one when verifying transactions ...that is the reward for running a full node and many people put a high value on that ability

There's no reason you can't use both bitauth and oauth at the same time. OAuth is very http centric and focused on authorization whereas bitauth is only concerned with authentication using bitcoin cryptographic primitives (for identity and signing) and isn't heavily tied to http.  The new bitpay API uses a token system to implement a capability based API for authorization that can (and will) support OAuth protocols.

It wouldn't have any use in this context.  For https connections, a self signed certificate offers the benefit of an encrypted connection even though there is no identity verification benefit.  If a payment request (and the payment) are being communicated over https, you already have encryption.  Hence a signature on the payment request from a self signed certificate offers no benefit over an unsigned payment request.

That hasn't been determined yet.  We may just leave it enabled for as long as we have merchants still using it (but disable it for new merchants that sign up).

we call it premature modularization :)  ...we started down that path initially but decided defer it until we could see how things evolved organically …you can spend an awful lot of time agitating about how things are organized as it turns out

Ryan will be missed, but it sounds like he'll be doing cool stuff at reddit (and hopefully still contribute to bitcore)
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:48:14
I personally don't think it's a good idea to try and re-implement a full node with bitcore …you run the risk of going off on your own fork if you aren't bug for bug compatible with with majority of nodes on the network (and bitcoind represents the vast majority) …however, if bitcoind becomes more modular and linkable, you could link bitcoind into the same process as bitcore.

edit: I should add that, while yes you can run your own insight server, a user on one insight server is unable to coordinate wallets with a user on another insight server…we're working on a solution to that

A Bitcoin miner might choose to create ChainDB blocks directly, however they wouldn't gain much as they could just as well collect the transaction fee that someone else put on a ChainDB block defining transaction (which they do through the bidding process).
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:22:51
you look for a chaindb hash in the next block (and some chains may skip blocks deliberately to reduce the cost of maintaining the chain)
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:04:35
That's a good summary.  We wanted a decentralized means of building a chain secured against Bitcoin rather than a centralized or federated system.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:27:39
merged mining requires that a miner validate and create blocks for multiple chains (i.e. bitcoin and namecoin) ...or at least someone creating blocks for a miner needs to do that validation ...only the subset of miners that perform merged mining are helping to secure the other chain(s) ...and the miner must convert assets in the other chain(s) into something they desire (i.e. trading namecoin back into bitcoin) ...for these reasons, we believe merged mining would only be practical for a handful of very popular chains
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:59:14
it is easy to analyze the history of a chain and determine how many losing bids appear in bitcoin blocks (where bidders are paying a bitcoin tx fee but don't win the chaindb block) ...if it happens 50% of the time, you reduce the amount you're willing to bid correspondingly (i.e. by 50%) ...on average you would still end up paying the same amount to win chaindb blocks (it's just that a higher percentage of fees ends up on losing transactions)
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:54:40
ChainDB blocks do have value (otherwise, why create them) ...forks are punished because if you're not in consensus with the rest of the participants (on a fork) then the blocks you create will be worthless
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:14:51
No, but if you don't need the mesh network for communicating a transaction from sender to recipient, then nodes in the network can make decisions about relaying transactions based on economics without adversely affecting the delivery of transactions to recipients.  Nodes that originate a lot of transactions (i.e. blockchain.info) could sell profitable transactions to miners (and by knowing what fees miners would require, blockchain.info could always put an appropriate fee on transactions) …the UI could offer a selector between low, medium and high priority that would adjust the fee on the transaction accordingly.
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:03:30
that would depend entirely on the value associated with a chain (and each block in the chain)...if it was a DNS database (ala namecoin) and that database was the main DNS system for the Internet, the bids would probably be quite high (because you are effectively buying the right to insert DNS updates into the chain with your bitcoin transaction fee) ...for small or personal chains, the cost would be small and track the cost of getting any ordinary transaction into Bitcoin's chain

@_date: 2015-01-07 01:59:44
I've emailed them for clarification ...is it blockchain.info or "The Block Chain" (and I rather like that way of referring to bitcoin) ...either way, it's good to vote
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:36:53
Yes, this is one attack vector that we'd like to better mitigate ...one mitigation is that the miner's transaction is not guaranteed to be the one selected by the other participants in the chain (due to the deterministic weighted random selection)...but nevertheless they could cause trouble and cost the other participants money.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:21:45
the data in the chain could be anything ...the chain would be valuable to someone, otherwise no one would create blocks for the chain ...a block would reward the winner with something of value ...the content of the chain is not the subject of this paper
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:47:56
not an altcoin, but any data where a semantically consistent ordering of atomic updates is needed ...for a single administrator, you build an essentially counterfeit proof history of updates, for a group of administrators, no one needs to trust a single source of truth (the chain is the truth) ...it's common (especially in banking, but there are many other applications) to form joint ventures because of the need for one entity to control the database and be the source of truth ...with a ChainDB you wouldn't need to form the joint venture
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:33:24
in the future it might not be necessary, but right now transaction volume is already at a point where it is starting to negatively affect confirmation times
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:40:39
yes, it is possible to have a zero value utxo ...though at some point in the past the mesh network stopped retransmitting transactions with zero value outputs out of concern over utxo bloat ...selecting a utxo based on the lower value txid is just a mechanism for the nodes to converge on a utxo such that they are creating deliberately conflicting transactions that define the next chaindb block (so that losing bidders don't lose their bitcoins and honest participants can pool resources in building a chain)
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:29:49
correct ...you could hash a chain of blocks yourself and embed it into the bitcoin block chain, but you would be the sole administrator of that chain (singularly deciding which blocks and transactions are timestamped against bitcoin) ... Factom improves this by having a federated system ...ChainDB seeks to make this process fully decentralized

we're in support of "bits" … see this blog post for more info on how we'd like to handle the transition:

I'm very sorry that you've been affected by this change in our settlement minimums.  We were forced to make this change after our Canadian provider for CAD settlement decided to exit this business and stop servicing Bitcoin companies.  We impose these minimums because we must now resort to wire transfers that cost us about $50 each (and in some cases even more due to correspondent banking fees).  Without these minimums, we would lose money, but it's a big issue for merchants that do only a small volume in sales.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:56:15
We've always supported and encouraged businesses that want to do it themselves.  We even built some example code here:  (it's probably a bit dated now though).  And while we are excited about our success, it's better for the ecosystem to have competitors and choice in the market.  And what's good for the ecosystem is good for BitPay.

It takes 147 bytes to spend a payment that a buyer makes.  The expense of that is the cost that we are passing along as a network fee.  In December, this cost to BitPay was in excess of $2 million USD.  In January and February that cost has declined substantially as congestion on the network has subsided (which is why the network fee is now as low as it is).  Also, we design all of our tools such that our transactions will get included in the next block regardless of congestion levels.  This is essential for a usable and fast payment system.
For comparison purposes, here is a breakdown of the cost for every 1000 transactions processed.  These calculations are based on a current fee rate of 40 sat/byte reported by bitcoinfees.earn.com for the "fastest and cheapest transaction fee."  Note that in December we saw prevailing rates in excess of 1000 sat/byte.  The prevailing fee rate on BCH is 1 sat/byte.  The calculations use an exchange rate of $9446 for BTC and $1084 for BCH.  
147 bytes * 40 sat/byte / 1e8 * $9446 USD * 1000 transactions = $555.00
147 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 1e8 * $1084 USD * 1000 transactions = $1.59
Currently, the cost of using BCH is small enough that it is not worth the added UX complexity to present a network fee when users choose it (of course this will change if BCH fee rates rise).  We are also considering employing Segwit transactions as a way to further reduce our costs (and hence the network fee we charge), but I don't have stats handy that would show how much it would save (a large portion of the 147 bytes is witness data and would incur a smaller cost).
Our goal is to provide the best payment services on the blockchains we support and we will continue to innovate in our efforts to achieve that goal.  While BTC might be more expensive to use, we expect there to be limited consensus rule changes going forward.  That means that Bitcoin is a very well understood and stable system.  There is a lot of value in systems that are stable and well understood.  We contrast this with Bitcoin Cash where we expect more experimentation.  Experimentation is also valuable, but carries increased risk.  A large portion of our processing is for very high value transactions where where the current miner fees are irrelevant.  Bitcoin works extremely well for those transactions.

I'm sorry to hear that Henry.  The following is an explanation of how we compute the network cost that we pass along (note that the prevailing fee rate on the network was from a few days ago):

Also, note that we use the Bitcoin Core algorithm for determining the prevailing fee rate (not earn.com).  I believe it was written by Alex Morcos and is a good algorithm, but if we find better, we will certainly adopt it. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 04:43:33
we already do...we have to write this code for bitpay to function...we see no reason that we shouldn't open source it (it doesn't cost us anything if someone wants to use our code to build their own stuff)...other people and companies using and improving what we open source is a benefit to us (and everyone else)...it's amazing to me that these simple facts seem to escape most people

Bitcoin is an electronic transaction that settles immediately and the asset carries no counter party risk (the transaction is the asset).  It's the first time in history we've had a financial instrument like this and it is Bitcoin's intrinsic value.  This is what virtually every economist, the mainstream press, and the traditional financial industry completely miss (except the ones who don't, who are buying bitcoins).

This is exactly what we do and have always done.  Some of the coverage has implied that we previously only used mtgox, that's not the case and never has been.  We have always pulled rates from multiple exchanges.  We do not take a weighted average, we blend the order books together and give the buyer the highest rate possible.  The only thing we changed is that we dropped mtgox' order book.  We had to do this because we could no longer sell on mtgox due to their suspension of USD withdrawals to the US.
