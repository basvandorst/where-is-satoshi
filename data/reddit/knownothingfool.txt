Folks who may turn out to be dead right or wrong- No one knows.

McAfee not looking great either though he does have some time before he has to eat his dick on Nat'l TV!

I got paid from Bovada but they are desperately afraid to pay out to some STATES in the US of A. If you opened your account in say Florida, make a score and then move to NY and ask for a disbursement, It wont be easy.
Today it seems like yesterday was a good day to do that but with BTC as well as the stock market, today's genius can be tomorrow's idiot and vice versa.

Im not sure how to answer that question. I am saying, non hardened criminals when faced or threatened with jail time or in the alternative blabbing for relief from that possibility will always choose to talk-unless others have threatened them with something more than jail time of course.

Why? How do you protect from your HD dying/crashing. They all do eventually, no?

Makes the best pancakes by FAR!!

No way do they repay if everyone's BTC is stolen-Im-friggin-possible!

These are not pro criminals so likely one got scared and gave up the deal to the feds. Normal happening.

You do not yet have the knowledge to buy btc. Stay out until you learn a bit about it. JMHO

With BTC seemingly no longer anonymous, doesn't that bode poorly for the future price?
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:58:06
Im sure it had some effect now that everyone realizes it is not untraceable.

Im fairly certain those of us who bought in early 2017 or prior and sold that December would disagree with you. I made 17K on maybe a $1.5K investment -LTC, BTC and ETH! Those booked profits cant be taken from me though the Taxman got like $5k or so.
