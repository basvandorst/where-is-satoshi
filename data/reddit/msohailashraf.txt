Dollar transaction can be tracked, you can trace the person who made a transaction through bank or using an electronic transfer because all has a record, has bitcoin transaction any record about the person who made that?

So, if I print a real Iron coin, and name it Bitcoin, spread that to world, will that be traded in exchange?

There are some reasons behind the believe which people have on a currency. Those are facts, real assets a govt or nation has. if as you said, it is all about believe so if that is true then why China's Yuan and Indian Rupee is so cheaper? If just they believe that an Indian Rupee or China's Yuan has more worth than a dollar, will you believe? will you purchase that currency's single unit by paying a dollar?

So that is a proof of my words that dollars are based on assets, if a bank print more dollars than it is allowed then it is called inflation which lowers the value of a single dollar, if not then why there is unemployment in US? why 20% of people in the Us are jobless?

New Bitcoins like BCH, B2x, BTG are being created by a group (the group has already millions of bitcoins) you can also call it a group of companies incl but not limited to banks, their aim is to generate more bitcoins out of thin air (the free money like bch, b2x, btg) which they want to use to purchase more bitcoins, so why there is a concept or an idea "free money" behind each segregate witness or segwit or "so called forks" While bitcoin network does not require these segregate witness or forks to be implemented otherwise it is a failed currency which has no worth

mean to say that as you said, govts are able to ask the banks to print more dollars, in your words "Today, many governments use a fractional banking reserve system that allows banks to print money whenever they need it." so if govts allow the banks to print more dollars to compete with unemployment in a country and paper money is not based on assets so why there is still unemployment in US? why govt does not provide jobs to those people?
