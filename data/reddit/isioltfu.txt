No it will drop further, come back at maybe 3-4K
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:53:03
OK boomer
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:26:31
Hahaha when a shill goes against another shill because they're so busy shilling they don't bother reading carefully.

Either I've got a cover or I'm an obvious shill. Make up your mind which.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:08:33
A drop so steep it's going to be in Free Solo 2
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:26:13
Time to call bullshit guys, cut your losses. Lucky if the bottom is 3K, could be even 1K.
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:27:18
Family, 2011 2012.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:48:32


Sure about that? Current spot is $1470, you think price was never lower than this between 2011 and now?
Also nobody except countries actually invests in physical gold. It's all about the mining ETFs.

OK boomer
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:49:05
Yep, probably 7K before end of month.
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:37:00
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:43:43
Because it rallied so amazingly January 2018 and 2019?
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:05:15
Wait a bit longer, it's going to get heavily discounted soon.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:45:03
OK boomer
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:18:27
I'm flattered. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-02 10:34:35
And who are you buying them from?
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:09:42
You mean 0.1%
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:47:01
So when it doesn't pump on Friday, will you promise to stop spreading bullshit going forward?
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:15:59


One of the most ignorant things I've ever read.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:27:10
Just showing that the comment I replied to is meaningless garbage that is only upvoted because it is bullish.
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:19:05
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:36:18
Not for long
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:06:22
Apology accepted.
@_date: 2019-08-31 08:50:16
A weekend pump coming. There are many signs pointing to it. Either profit off it or be left by the side of the road.
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:50:36
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:12:02
This is about as classic as pump and dump gets. It's a wonder it still works.
@_date: 2019-10-30 10:49:40
Last chance to sell above 9K
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:28:24
The bankers are laughing at you buddy.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:58:01
The shills are out in force.  The astroturf machine is cranked up full blast.  The pumping and fomo pushing is off the charts.
Bitcoin is not worth $7,500.
This is the most unstable form of money ever devised, and all these shills are just making it more volatile.  Sell, sell now folks.  Capitulation is closer at hand than you think.
@_date: 2019-10-25 09:07:18
You're asking this in a bitcoin shill sub. Try asking actual people with knowledge and you'll get very different answers.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:30:15
Alright so move funds out of btc and into other investments during 2020 got it
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:52:20
So, exceptional events and catastrophies aside, you seem to imply that there is a nonzero price floor for bitcoin. Is that a fair statement?
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:36:00
You seem conflicted. It's a very simple yes or no question. Can bitcoin go to 0?
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:04:49
Right. Excuse me for not financially planning my future around asteroid mining.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:03:22
Yeah why would we choose bitcoin again? Store of value should be stable like gold and silver.
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:56:56
So now we trust banks and establishments? I thought we didn't do that around these parts. Or is it only when they speak positively about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:58:19
Also down 40% since 6 months ago. Cherry picking is fun!
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:06:05
So I'm guessing you bought when it was sub 1K and never sold.
Does it hurt when you lie in bed at night, thinking how much money you could have had?
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:22:29
Ah yes the random spike. A classic technical pattern to profit from.
@_date: 2019-12-21 19:26:53
Shit like this getting upvoted is why no one takes bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:18:00
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:29:31
But how can you be certain of a price floor without knowing what that price is? The implication is that there is a price at which bitcoin, again disasters and catastrophes aside, cannot possibly go lower. What is this price?
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:22:02
Okay so given your warning about risk you acknowledge that there is a possibility of btc going to 0 then. That's good.
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:59:27
Lmao you're an idiot. Have fun gambling all your money away.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:18:13
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this dump on your relationships in the real world, and as a result, on your financial health. I have expressed this reality to the mods and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your bitcoins you will receive a Reddit gold one off bonus. If the sub as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale you will receive an additional Reddit platinum award, a piece.
For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I can't tell how important that first hour and a half is going to be. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, idiots, shills, your mother if she's buying...and remember, no swaps, its outgoing only today.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:48:55
It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:33:55
Sell it all. Today. If bitcoin depreciates by just 25%, that loss would be greater than the entire market capitalisation of Jeremy Irons.
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:37:16
If someone said "sell the peak", they would be ridiculed. How could you possibly know what is a peak until price has come down and the peak is formed?
Yet everyone latches on to "buy the dip" as if it's some divine revelation.
