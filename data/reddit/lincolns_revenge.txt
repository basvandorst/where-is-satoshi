I would buy so hard if it hit 7k without some real world news pushing the price down that far.  I mean, what are the odds of it taking even a month to return to 10k from 7k, probably pretty low. It would probably recover in a week.

The real answer to 99 percent of questions in these threads.

What was the fake news about?

How do they handle prices in BTC as volatile as the value is these days? Is it dynamic or something?  I would always be trying to time my purchases with drops in the value of BTC otherwise.

What is some possible good news that people are hoping comes out of the G20 summit?

Can you not use GDAX? I was under the impression that they were the same company and that the delays and fees are lower to non-existant with GDAX.

I use them both. They are the same company now as far as I understand.  If you have a coinbase account and take a picture of your photo id and send it to them then you also have a verified account at GDAX.
GDAX has no fees for transferring money into my bank account.  Takes about three days.  Coinbase has the ability to get money instantly into your bank account via paypal.  However, the first time you try to transfer funds you received from coinbase from your paypal account to your bank account they will almost certainly freeze the money for 20 to 24 hours.
For Nicehash users, you can go from nicehash to coinbase to GDAX to your bank account with no fees except for the tiny cut nicehash takes for the service they provide.

Who is selling? Probably people that need spendable money right now.

It takes more time and care to increase price through manipulation of an unregulated market than it does to sell off all the reward of that manipulation without fear of any consequence.

A home in a real estate market that's in high demand?  That's about all I can think of.  As a bonus, you get to live in some place that's fun or beautiful where where more people want to live than leave.
Better than a cramped car with no leg room that doesn't allow you to do the one thing it's good at without getting ticketed or arrested.

You needed the cash I presume?  I dont understand why so many sell at some price below 10K when the cycle of price manipulation so frequently pivots the price above and below 10K.

And please, be as specific as possible, if you don't mind.

I mean, the whales are a very real thing.  A relatively small number of people own around half of all bitcoin and they are free to collude as they see fit to control prices in an unregulated market.  Even if they don't make moves as collective groups (which they undoubtedly do) certain individuals on their own have such large stakes that they can buy and sell to move the price at will.  Fortunately, most of them probably have the long term price of bitcoin staying high in their own best interest.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:22:19
Yes, and it only costs a couple of bitcoins.

Which donation service supports bitcoin? Patreon still doesn't, right?
