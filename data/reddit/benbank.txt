I can do this with Venmo.

Thanks for the reply. At the end of the day though, our financial sovereignty is pegged, and will continue to be pegged, to the dollar. Our carrots, bread and chips are denominated in dollars. If Walmart ever comes to accept BTC, I would bet governments get involved, defeating this purpose of the coin.

Exposure to the asset class is one thing, wide acceptance as a medium of exchange for consumers is another. If the latter came to fruition, I have zero doubt governments would move to do something.

Thanks for the clear response. I think you'll see bank fees coming down a lot going forward, especially as fraud/chargebacks decline.
I'm not sure I understand the proof of identity issue though - do you not want the companies you are selling through to know who the seller is ?

But what I don't understand is why you would rather use BTC than USD to make that Germany purchase ?
Why does Occulus rift give a damn whether they are buying their materials in BTC, in USD, in Chinese Yuan, or any other currency ?

When's the last time you bought something on amazon from another country ?

This is wildly optimistic in my view, but good luck.

May I ask, of what use is bitcoin to you ? What do you use it for ? Presumably as a store of value and to transfer money. Can't you do this with US dollars ?

I don't see why any sovereign nation would view bitcoin favourably, and would actively encourage other nations to accept it.

And would your experience have been better if you used BTC rather than USD, or whatever currency you used ?

How about if a law is passed banning the acceptance and usage of virtual currencies such as bitcoin ?
