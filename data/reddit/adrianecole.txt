The negative publicity they will get for eating batteries will surely mean this won't work - nobody is going to be deceived. There must be more to it. How they market this will be fascinating !

Addresses in HD wallets don't usually work like that. You are not likely to have 20 unused addresses in a row and then suddenly decide to use the 21st address. 
Scanning for 20 unused addresses mean that the wallet can be pretty sure that it is accounting for all your tx. The wallet has to stop somewhere and searching for 20 is a good number. It's not about 'reused lately' its more 'ever used'.

Not exactly, one of the payment processing companies on the Isle of Man (Capital Treasury Services)  had to stop working with Bitcoin companies due to pressure from one or more of the large clearing banks in London. It's a commercial banking problem, not an Isle of Man problem.

I believe that Coinbase very likely act as the other payment gateways do, they will be selling those coins as fast as they can in case the price moves and they can't fulfil the USD payments to the merchant. Coinbase (or Bitpay etc) cannot take the risk of holding the coins.

I just don't see how the electricity consumed by mining on these devices will cost less than the the pitiful amount of satoshis produced will be worth.

The hardware is completely underwhelming, as most people have pointed out. Their software needs to kick ass for this to be relevant. 
There is a simple analogy. I could build a NAS/small office server with cheap parts or an old PC and some time customising various stock Ubuntu apps, or I can buy a Synology or Qnap device. Those devices really shine due to the software  - so lets wait and see what the software from 21 has in it, don't see many clues to that yet.

Who are the potential customers? It's not miners, it's not the knowledgeable bitcoin crowd. It *could* be devs/tinkerers/geeks who are yet to play with bitcoin, but they will soon find threads like this and realise the established community don't understand the product largely.
It's a dev kit - not a full product, so you really have to be a developer to make any use of it, and developers can use google and see it for what it is.
Oh, and the T&amp;Cs are really covering all the bases, they will have all your data
I really don't get it - the software needs to be VERY special.
