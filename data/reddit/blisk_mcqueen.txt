Your analysis is assuming knowledge of the true value of an bit of electronic data and your assumption isn't $0. So your conflating perceived and true value. Bitcoin has no value, just perceived value. If you operate under the assertion that there is any true value at all, you're misunderstanding what gives BTC value - namely other people assuming it has value. 
There's nothing of value here that isn't transitory. Making the mistake of assuming real value to a cryptocurrency is a good way to lose money.

All Internet security, banking, encryption, ssl, the basic security structure of all online life goes out the window. 
Whoever gets the quantum computer first gets to break everyone else's codes and encryption from that monent until the cryptopocalypse.

I don't think you understand the person you're replying to. Either that or we speak different languages and your accusations are (in your tongue) substitutes for a reply that coherently addresses what the other person is speaking about. 
Re-read and see that the other poster is not advocating any course, and is just saying the relatively uncontroversial "it would be better for all the bitcoin investors not to sell, so their coins won't drop in value right now."

Why did you sell?

millions of imaginary tricky dick fun bills. Money is worthless, anyone who is killing themselves over it has got their life screwed on completely backwards. 
I'd as soon kill myself over soap as money. Soap at least does something, and it's a physical object.

No. When the price stops falling is the time to buy.

Even more. A month ago it was just bubbling up from 200ish.

for the next couple of weeks or months. Unless BTC has fundamentally changed (if so, what?) then the value hasn't changed. It's people's perceptions.
