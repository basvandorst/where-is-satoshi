Fuck i got the same setup. even the whiskey glass is the same. Holy crap
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:42:33
The problem with this setup is, if you are getting power cuts every once in a while, your database will get corrupted and 1-2 months of work will get fucked, unless you add a battery to your setup.
I run a node on my old eee pc netbook with a fresh battery. Runs faster and safer against database corruptions.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:18:43
bitpaymain, we don't need this shit.
good job op.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:52:59
Community is already divided. There is no way that we can stand together. Bcash2x or Bcash has a community supoport they say? So does bitcoin!
They want their own coin? Let them have it!
Devs will come up with a solution and bitcoin won't die. This is just 637th try.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:57:26
Let them find all the blocks and mine all the coins. Then what? They'll end up with a finished chain. Lol fucktard bcashers.

Roger don't want to lose Bitpay, so he went full berserk on Segwit/LN because LN will let every company to build their own Bitpay. (via LN)
We'll suffer for a short time because of companies like bitpay are leaving but in the long run the other companies won't be needing bitpay's services.
Unless Jihan/Roger buy every bitcoin related business out there, there is no hope for them.

No need a trezor while you can get a paper wallet for free. I would advise to keep that 50$ it might become 500$ next year.
 Don't spend your precious coins on useless crap like HW wallets.

It is very hard to spend it on securing the network while there are only 2 mining hw sellers and both of them are from China.
Bring back GPU mining and I'll be more than happy to spend my money on hashpower. Till then, no. I won't be feeding Bitmain while they can use ASICBOOST and I can't. (and also there is antbleed.)
There is also another corp Canaan and they seem to be neutral on anything but again, China. If it gets broken I got fucked.

Hodling is risk free. You can't lose until they shut down the internet which is highly unlikely.
Trading is risky. You can lose money and get trapped in a bull trap. What then? You are FUCKED.
JUST HODL IT.
You'll be making less then trading bots maybe but you'll be making money automatically. You don't need to do anything yo! You don't even need to check charts!!
JUST HODL IT!
People sold on 2k$ and it went to 4k$ later. Many bought back in from 4k$!! What happened to them? Fucked! (not in the long term but they lost potential gains from 2k$ to 4k$)
I do this for years and i understood it perfectly. Whatever i bought in the past, i never ever sell now. If it goes higher, i may buy more or not, but if it goes lower; I BUY A LOT MORE! Why? Because its cheaper than before!!!
I decided to make long term investments that's why, I HODL!

maybe you can put this command somewhere in your tutorial also;

socket sending timeout
What do you think? Chromium was on btw. Chromium crashed maybe?

@_date: 2017-07-09 15:50:30
Nothing shows up actually.
I just check if its running with the getinfo command like you said.
No no, pi was working. But when i used getinfo command, it says node wasn't working :D
This was happening when my swap file was lower than 1000mb before. My pi wasn't crashing but only the node.
But now even though my swap was 1000mb, node went missing again. Restarted it now.
No voltage drops as far as i can see btw. No red light blinks

Alright so dphys-swapfile is the config file of the actual swap file and the actual swap file is located in /var/swap and this is still on the hdd.
So there is nothing to worry about it. Got it!
I need to setup SSH and stuff but It will be another adventure for me. I am fine with my 3" lcd now as long as my node is running.

Segwit, yes. 2x, no.
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:58:29
Possible. 
I also saw that my router is up for only 5 hours. Maybe I got those network errors because my internet went down 5 hours ago. (my pi's clock is off and I am not good at maths :D)
And probably my pi's crash had nothing to do with those errors.

Now weee came to this. Thanks god. I was going to ask you about this but it looked like it was offtopic so I passed. :D
My router it seems, don't support uPnP. (not sure but I read it somewhere reecntly. need further research on this.) upnp: if I understood correctly, It is a progress for the apps that opens ports on the router, automatically.
So I opened my ports manually on the router because pi won't be doing it.
My Core client on my laptop, works fine with the ports I opened. I opened for my laptop and for the pi. Separately. (they have different internal IP's.)
The port 8333 is normally closed when I check it on 
But, as soon as I open my core client on my laptop, It becomes OPEN.
But that's not the case with my PI. I think It should become OPEN when I open the node on my PI too, It is not happening.
Maybe should I remove uPNP addressing from my Pi client??

Yes, HDD stays in a box with a sata/usb adapter. It is a 2.5" laptop hdd but i was using it as an external usb storage with the help of that box.
I tried to run it without a hub before, it didn't work out but it was before i purchased this official adapter. (My red light was blinking back then) I haven't tried it again with the new adapter.
It has been running since the last freeze for almost 5 hours or something. I won't interrupt it till it crashes again.
I am running it with a 500mb swap file now. Seems like everything is going smooth (at least for now)
Yes both my hub and the pi are having their powers from the same power outlet with the help of an extender (or coupler). That might be the problem too. I'll get my usb hub to another power outlet. (later)
Nice suggestions. I'll try them out if it crashes again. Thanks!

Here it says that;
"Edit: On Raspbian the default location is /var/swap, which is (of course) located on the SD card. I think it is a bad idea, so I would like to point out, that the /etc/dphys-swapfile can have the following option too: CONF_SWAPFILE=/media/btsync/swapfile
I only problem with it, the usb storage is automounted, so a potential race here (automount vs. swapon)"

/var/swap and /etc/dphys-swapfile are those different things?

Hmm. I made a test about this. It is called backfeeding. I started my pi while the hub was connected to the pi but without the original adapter was connected  and there was no screen light/led light or what soever.
So I don't think it was backfeeding. Might be though. But unlikely.
Maybe it was kicking in randomly.
If I get rid of that usb hub, It will solve my problems probably.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:48:17

@_date: 2017-07-10 21:57:46
I guess I made it this time.
Everything has been running smoothly for almost 6hours nearly. Got back to USB-Hub setup btw.
One thing took my attention though. My pi's green led almost never blinks. It used to be blinking like mad while it was working.
Now it flashes maybe once in 2-3 mins.
Thanks for the great tutorial. :)

Another question:
What about setting up a static Ip? I guess this tutorial don't mention anything about it.
I learn another thing new by every minute. Now I learned that the node I run is not as useful as a node which has 8333 ports open.

I found the problem i guess.
It is called "backfeeding" Powering RP3 directly from the hub right now, working good since last hour. Juss lettin u know.
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:12:52
Found a way for static IP's! (IT works btw!!)
And now my 8333 are also open!
My node is INVINCIBLE!

If you want to be taken serious come back with a better code.

Still running :D I guess It is now safe to say I did it :d (we did it :D)
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:16:52
Crashed again :D (unresponsive pi) Looks like After I get 330k blocks something happens to my pi.
Last time I checked 1 hour before the crash It was at 325k blocks.

That was the GUI?
I thought It was just a regular webpage which auto starts when I boot my device and has nothing to do with the full node so i deleted its line. :D
By GUI, I thought you were talking about this: 
Maybe the problem was that line I deleted? ( --kiosk --incognito

I also learned that 8 connection limit is there because our 8333 ports are blocked. (or not open)
We can have more than 8 connections actually If we had 8333 ports open.

I done the math. My node crashed exactly after 8 minutes of my router's IP change.
That's why I had those ping outs. It tries to connect 8 mins more then crashes.
But I still don't understand why whole Pi crashes because of this but not node only?
After the last crash It has been running without a problem.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:35:10
Big blocks are dangerous. There is a chance of creating orphan blocks because the internet connection is not fast enough on every part of the globe.
Node count will also decrease dramatically. Reduces the security.

Ran the node for more than 10 hours maybe and just before I woke up, It became unresponsive again.
This time the CPU was being used 100% at the time of the freeze.

The problem was my USB hub. I plugged it to my PC and there was no response. I formatted the sd for a few times but Good thing is I had the image.
I don't know what was wrong with the hub but it is working now.
So no problems now.

You are describing nodes, not miners.

It will always be a GPU-based algo probably. Nothing to worry.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:20:41
Yes I guess I have to start again.
Just checking that debug  file before I do and If i find nothing I'll delete the blocks I downloaded and try again once more, if fails, back to step 1...

@_date: 2017-07-08 11:31:17
I made some additions to my bitcoin.config file like;
Also gpu ram is set = 16mb
That's how i run my node without a swap file. So far it is doing good. I'll let it run for a full day and see if it crashed again. If not, I'll let it run like that.
If it crashes again with this setup, (or my node closes itself again) then i'll get back to swap file.
I still don't understand something though:
My swap file was located in, /etc/dphys-swapfile 
Isn't this located on the hdd? If it is, then it means my swap file runs from the hdd. If it runs from the hdd, then from what i've read, there is nothing to worry about.
I am too noob with this stuff I hope you don't get mad. :)

The error says;
