The database accepted "Upside down arrow bobble" as the truth, but outside of the database, it is a lie.  Hence the term "outside context".  True in its own context, but false (or unknown) outside of it.
Replace "FirstName" for "Blockhash" and you have Bitcoin.  
Your local Bitcoin node database* will accept any hash into the "BlockHash" field. You can literally "mine" your own blocks using prepared hashes by running a couple of SQL Insert statements.  When those blocks are broadcast, the consensus network will smack you down and call you a liar.
*Direct access to the database, bypassing the UI.

It's not a protocol either.
IMO, as a DBA, one of Satoshi's least talked about breakthroughs was the solving of the "outside context problem" for validating a fact inside a database.
A database considers all data that passes constraint validation as the "truth".  The outside context problem asks the question "Is that data really true outside of the database? (aka the real world)"
Consider a simple "FirstName" attribute.  If the constraint is "Must be a letter of the alphabet and less than 50 characters long", the following values are database "truths"
* Gary
* John
* Upside down arrow bobble.
Obviously the third example is a lie but the database does not know and does not care.  Enter Satoshi's Consesus mechanism.  Using POW, an entire network notices that "Upside down arrow bobble" is garbage and rejects it.

That is your fatal premise.
I do like the cut of your jib, but alas.

The only reason the market will consider the switch is when it has to.
e.g Central Bank inflation , censorship, etc...
The good news* is that it is happening now albeit in slow motion.
*for BTC holders, bad for everyone else.

That's wrong.  It's actually the most efficient.
One million 1 Hash/s miners that consume 1W each is better than one 1 million Hash/s user that consumes 1.5MW.

Don't care.  Opera is dead to me.  I paid for the original Opera when it had Mail, Web and BitTorrent in built.  As soon as Stephenson left I followed suit.
