Yes. When you issue a transaction from an SPV client, the first node that receives your transaction knows your IP address and can associate it with the source Bitcoin address. 
Using Tor can help, maybe, but Tor provides very weak anonymity, and some people (e.g. Mike Hearn) consider all Tor-originated addresses tainted.

Keep in mind that your CPU cache, while just a cache, provides coherency guarantees. I use a cache literally 3 billion times a second with no anomalies. It's only with MongoDB and Cassandra that people started to assume that they will always see stale data. That's neither desirable nor inevitable.
Even among inconsistent caches, Mongo stands out by not providing monotonicity, or even "read my writes" consistency.
I hear what you are saying about applications. We are used to seeing snapshots, our of date responses and the like.
But we are not used to seeing time flow backwards. With mongo, you can perform a write, do a read, and not even see the write that you yourself performed. Or you can see that something happened, and then it ceases to exist. WTF is all a reasonable person can say, and that's what all these coinbase users are screaming out.
All of these problems result in support calls, and every support call turns into a reddit thread because the kind of person who deploys mongo in a financial application is the kind of lazy bum who can't handle support properly.
And it's all a pity because we know someone good can do far better.

This use of the word "semantics" tells me that you're uneducated. "Semantics" means "meaning." And yes, I am very much asking for the meaning of "pseudoanonymous." 
It doesn't matter what is recorded in the blockchain if other details (e.g. transactions when they are introduced by SPV wallets) deanonymize the user, for instance by being associated with an IP address.
I'm not a miner -- that seems to be a money losing proposition -- so that argument doesn't apply to me or the vast majority of Bitcoin users.

This is not an intelligent answer. Nor is it correct. And your argument technique, where you insult people the moment your world view is challenged, isn't going to win anyone over.

What if the detractors were reacting not to the currency, but to the toxic community built around this new technology?
I love Bitcoin, but a quick look around here shows the following:
* cult-like behavior, hailing a guy with absolutely no credentials (and evidently, he's not even doing his job of tracking security issues at a critical exchange) solely because he talks fast and brings new people into the cult, ignoring or actively suppressing bad news (every fucking thing is good news for Bitcoin), brigading people who seem critical, attacking Nobel laureates.
* a HODL environment that keeps the economy from growing.
* countless scams, wherein the community immediately blames the victims.
* money-launderers are hailed as heroes, once-beloved Karpeles was convicted of fraud even before he pulled his famous fraud, Bitpay's founder's previous job was to take and put up pictures of 13yo girls in suggestive poses, seems like half the board of the bitcoin foundation has been to jail, some are felons.
* an inability to admit technical problems (GHash and centralization anyone?) and thus an inability to evolve the platform technically, creating the environment for tons of pointless copycats to evolve.
* rallying around the idea of decentralization and trustlessness, and then actually having to trust people (at mining pools, exchanges, etc) whose intentions aren't clear, and in some cases, where no one even knows who the fuck they are.
* in-group/out-group behavior, where people are downvoted solely because of their perceived tribal affiliation.
* abjectly selfish behavior, with no sign of a positive, constructive community spirit, embodying the "I got mine" attitude of asshole right-wingers
* claiming that national currencies are obsolete, that an append-only log (i.e. the blockchain) is the solution to just about every problem on earth including lupus, that we will soon live an apocalyptic world where we roam around like Mad Max, where western infrastructure will fail left and right, but somehow Bitcoins will retain their value.
* [WTF-worthy shit like this]( that affects innocent kids' lives, in this case, naming a little girl Satoshi Bitcoin. 
I could go on and on. I see a lot of you complaining about You realize that they are not attackers or detractors. The folks over there love Bitcoin just as much, and possibly more than you do. They're not your enemies. *They are just making fun of you because you all deserve it*. And in fact, the rise of that 2400-person, tiny subreddit has actually been good, no, great for Bitcoin, because it has helped rein in some of the assholery in this community. But you all need to do much more to reform if you want the parody to stop.

You should have no worries if it's encrypted and inactive. It'd be wise to reboot after saving an encrypted wallet, because remnants of the encryption key may be in memory if the wallet is sloppily written.
I disagree with the rest of the folks here though that all is well. If you get malware, you might lose the BTC at the point of transfer.

GHash is in a position where it can keep out any transaction from the network. It's also in a position where it can refuse any block found by any other miner. They can collect 100% of the mining rewards.
Can you say that any of these things did *not* happen? How would you know if they were to refuse selected transactions? 
BTW, someone attacked Eligius and BTCGuild. Chances are that it was GHash with their excess capacity. So, that did happen.
I'm not concerned about the BTC price. It's a lagging indicator. Lots of Bitcoin "investors" do not understand the technology, and the price will remain up for quite a while. GHash will probably be on their best behavior for the next few weeks. But when the attacks start, it'll be too late.

Same here. These retards will deny actual real problems even as they are happening. "No one would ever reach 51%, that'd be crazy" well, that happened. "If they reach 51%, the miners will immediately leave" not really, it took a lot of public begging, and it's still not clear if they actually left or if GHash decided to lie low for a while. "Ghash might command 51%, but they would never launch any attack, that'd be crazy" well buddy, that's coming down the pipe and you won't even know it when they start pulling subtle attacks. 
All these guys want is a greater fool who'll buy their Bitcoins from them, the coins that they purchased at the peak. So they are engaging in an activity for short-term gain, which damages Bitcoin in the long term. And that's precisely like the GHash miners.

He doesn't understand what he's talking about. For instance, Bitcoin depends on [cryptographic hardness assumptions]( which are actually not based on any law or principle. We *believe* certain hash functions to be non-invertable. We *think* they are impossible to invert. But there is definitely no mathematical law for this. Some people came up with certain functions that are very very difficult to invert, and resist all known techniques. But previous functions were broken, after a few decades of use. In fact, if someone were to come up with a law that leads to provably non-invertable functions, they'd almost certainly qualify for a Turing Award.

Not really. It implies a "forwards-incompatible" change. Old Bitcoin protocol software will be unable to process the new blocks created by the new Bitcoin protocol.

Come on guys, this is complete and utter BS. 1 BTC can only hold its value if the demand for Bitcoins remains at its current level against the supply of Bitcoins. 
Part of that assumption involves a promise by the real Satoshi that he will never sell his coins. Don't tell me that he lost his keys, you morons don't know that. 
Another part of that assumption is that no one will cross over the 51% boundary and make the currency centralized. You're essentially trusting a bunch of Russians at GHash/CEX.io whose names you do not even fucking know. And don't tell me that they'd never cross 51%, they fucking did that a month ago.

I suspect that's because NY isn't the right jurisdiction. If neither DPR nor the target were in NY for any part of the planning and alleged hit, you cannot sue in NY. The DA would mention that these charges exist, in order to reduce the likelihood of bail in NY, which is what I think happened here.
I read the Maryland indictment and they seem to have quite a bit of evidence of DPR arranging a hit. I didn't check how much evidence they have tying DPR down to Ulbricht, but that's what the court case is all about.

GBT has nothing to do with anyone's ability to execute a 51% attack. What makes you think it solves the current crisis? 
Edit: You probably think it's because GBT allows the workers to decide which transactions to include. That's not sufficient for two reasons:
1. The miners are on a GHash controlled network, so GHash can control what transactions they see, and therefore include.
2. GHash can still exclude wholesale blocks from competing mining pools.

Go look into how decentralized exchanges work. Just because there is no centralized exchange doesn't mean that a MITM cannot front run. To the contrary, the decentralized nature of the exchange makes it far easier to eavesdrop and intercept orders coming in.

This is not an argument, just an appeal to vague authority. I also note that you're bringing out the insults now that you're beginning to realize you're wrong.
The answer is yes, a decentralized exchange, where any node can join the system and participate as a server that keeps the order book, cannot use encryption. If it did, the attacker would participate as a server and gain access to the decryption keys. 
P2P systems are inherently slow because they have participants on residential networks, and a well-funded attacker can just buy a whole bunch of well-connected nodes. 
It's ok to be wrong on occasion. Not ok to be an ass to the guy who is educating you.

The writer is assuming that the person who sold at 436 is the same as the one buying at 443. There is no basis for this assumption.
The writer is claiming that "negative trading fees" explain what's going on. There's no such thing as a negative trading fee -- the proper name for that is a subsidy, and no one will subsidize money-losing transactions like this, at least, not for long.
It sounds like someone saw some trades, linked them in his head without evidence, noticed a 3% difference in prices and claimed that 1.5% "negative trading fees" explain what's going on. None of this makes sense.
This doesn't mean CaVirtex is doing things right -- chances are, they aren't -- but this note doesn't explain anything.

Can't any of you imbeciles read or acknowledge reality?

Every time an academic paper exposes a flaw in the protocol, e.g. as in the red balloons or selfish mining papers, the response here is ridiculously hostile. People don't seem to realize that these scientists are doing all of us a service by identifying weaknesses and suggesting ways to fix them. 
And let's not even discuss Ron and Shamir's paper. There are ways of pointing out errors in people's work. Shamir is the fucking S in RSA. We would not have public key crypto without his work, and we wouldn't have Bitcoin without public key crypto. We all needed to be more civil when pointing out the error. 
Finally, there's Krugman. Say whatever you like, he's a credible economist with a Nobel prize. When he asks a question, we need to take it seriously and respond in kind. But the reaction here was absolutely unhinged, emotional and embarrassing. We could have responded objectively.
So, I think this community has a lot of maturing up to do. Scientists are not our mortal enemy. The idiots voting with their wallets and spewing invective here are a disgrace.

These arguments have all been trashed by empirical data.
Prior to GHash, people used to say that "no miner would cross 51%, it'd be against their self-interest." GHash crossed that line. 
Now you're saying "no miner would cross 51% and remain there, it'd be against their self-interest." Others are saying "no miner would cross that line and launch an attack."
Well Sherlock, GHash launched double-spend attacks even before they crossed the line. 
All of these arguments are bogus because they assume that the miners' interests are aligned with long-term holders'. That's not true for three reasons:
1. A 51% miner may be taken over by hackers and abused.
2. You have no idea what a miner's interests are. Perhaps they'll want to buy lots of coins cheap; then it'd make sense to crash the currency temporarily and sweep up. Or perhaps they'll want to be at 51% for a while to crush a competing miner. Or they realize that their aging rigs are about to become outdated soon. Who the fuck knows? Certainly not you.
3. Empirical data has proven you wrong at every point. At which point do you throw in the towel and say "we need a more robust mechanism for deterring 51% miners?"

Sounds like you think Bitcoin is the first micropayment platform. It isn't. Micropayments were around 20 years ago. Look here ( How many times must an idea fail before you guys can admit that it has failed?
Also soundslike you don't understand how naming works. If I use a word like "kabuzbab", and you don't know what it stands for, then that system doesn't work. I need you to understand what that word means. So it's not sufficient for me to install a resolver. I need everyone else to install the resolver. Until then, it's a losing proposition. 
I'm not sure why Ethereum gets so much love around here. It's just a dumb altcoin that may some day do something that no one wants. Until that day, it's vaporware. You have no idea what they're testing. It's not hard to extend the Bitcoin scripting language. It's impossible to get that system to disburse payment fairly to everyone whose resources are used. They're doing the former, punting on the latter, and relying on the kindness of strangers.

You do not know who he is and what his interests are, so you cannot possibly know his best interests. Perhaps he has an even bigger stake in an alternative currency, and it's in his best interest to crash Bitcoin. Perhaps he is at gunpoint. Perhaps he just wants to mess with you.

OP is saying "Andreas, you lent your name and credibility to a product you should have known to be a fraud." Keep in mind that Neo &amp; Bee's business model was to simply buy &amp; hold Bitcoins, paying out 6% and 10% guaranteed interest. It was clear that the company would go under if the Bitcoin price did not go to the moon. 
Your defense amounts to: "but we all genuinely believed in N&amp;B's  business model, whatever you might say, we were genuine believers." As such, it is a pure appeal to emotion. If you agree that Andreas's name was used to promote Neo &amp; Bee (which it was), then Andreas cannot be blameless. He should have met more with the team, he should have grilled Danny, he should have done better due diligence before he agreed to have his name placed on the roster.
There is no way Andreas can come out of this without a ding on his reputation. His name was very much part of the Neo &amp; Bee scam, and he should have guarded it more carefully.

It's protected by the difficulty of doing certain kinds of math. So for laymen, you can say "as long as (certain kinds of) math is hard, Bitcoin will be around." 
BTW, almost every computer scientist firmly believes that the computational hardness assumptions are reasonable and unlikely to be broken overnight. Usually, weaknesses begin to show, at which point, we can upgrade to new functions that are more resilient. But it's a process of trial and error, because the functions are *not* based on any kind of firm law, yet.

* Bitcoin is not protected by any version of the gambler's ruin. In fact, GHash could singlehandedly collapse the entire currency. If you don't believe that GHash has 51% of the network (i.e. GHash+"Unknown"), then GHash and one of the other pools could conspire to bring the entire currency down. So no, Bitcoin is not protected by gambler's ruin here.
* The Poisson distribution has no implications on consensus. The mining process could be normal or heavy-tailed and it wouldn't quite matter, besides a second-order effect on the difficulty computation.

This email is strong solely in tone, not in any factual content. He was arrested, perhaps not charged, but was arrested in the Spanish villa of a guy who he admits is a federal criminal for engaging in terrible acts with minors. The police said they found tons of child porn in that house. 
And let me answer his question on why his case is different from Karpeles and Shrem. It's because people feel that justice can possibly be served in the case of these two people. We know how to prosecute financial crimes. But drugging and raping children are the kind of crime that no punishment can make whole again. That's why people find perpetrators of such crime, **and the people who associate with them**, so repulsive.

The anonymity I have for an unused address does not matter in the slightest. (Note difference between wallet and address).


It's also not anonymous if you use it to buy things shipped to your home, if you use an SPV wallet, if you do not use Tor, etc. etc. 
The topic of the thread is "being paid in Bitcoin." So the practical answer is "it's not actually anonymous."  The moment it takes off, whatever little anonymity the system may offer is lost. 
I'm fine with this, and elsewhere I see that you're making the case to keep Bitcoin legal, which I also like.

You must realize that that's completely unacceptable for any company that did an IPO.


So you're admitting that you lacked a critical component of your business plan when you started offering your financial products.  I agree that you needed a way to hedge, and a market for offering derivatives, and market makers who would sell you those derivatives at prices that would guarantee your promised returns. 
But there was no reason to hope that you could actually accomplish your 10% return goal without the prices for those futures/derivatives, and the market for such futures/derivatives didn't even exist yet, let alone the prices.

What if some Russian tycoon wants to sweep up Bitcoin and GHash deliberately wanted to depress the price? What's the point of moving to a new system where we are at the whim of anonymous Ukrainians? That's not the Bitcoin I signed up for. 
Obviously, pumpers who bought at $1200 and are looking for a chump to unload onto are going to try to sweep this under the rug, but GHash reaching 51% was a big fucking deal. Anyone who says otherwise is either stupid or does not have Bitcoin's long term interests in mind.
