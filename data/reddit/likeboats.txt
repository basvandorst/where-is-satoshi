Got any evidence it's fake? Report for what, disagreeing with you? If Bitcoin itself can be forked and new rules proposed and addopted without any central authority, why does  owner has to do what this or that subreddit wants? They can start promoting Ethereum for all i care.

But Bitcoin is not a trademark, it's not owned by anyone afaik, what's onwned by someone are the domains and GitHub pages. If the twitter owner of Bitcoin supports a fork that's well within his rights. Bitcoin will always face this "problem".

Changing algorithms in centralised systems will be way easier and quicker than in Bitcoin

Visa/Master have chargeback, just so you know. Bitcoin is not a usable currency yet, I'd suggest not use large amounts of it yet unless you really trust the merchant.

Working as expected, now try to consolidate dust on BTC, can you?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:15:13
The minimum order is 1 share of whatever you want. Some exchanges charge little to nothing for orders under R$1000. You don't need to immediately diversity, take a year or so if you want.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:11:48
Lol most people have no idea how Bitcoin works, they're in for the gains, not the ancap ideals.

Downloading 50GB games was unthinkable up to a few years ago. Now it's common place. Tech evolves. Besides, if LN works as intended, the blocksize will have to increase anyway, so one way or another Bootstrapping will have to be improved.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:07:24
Nope. First big companies will have to create their hubs so people can open channel with them. Then we'll have to get out of this speculative bubble so people feel more likely to expend their coins.
Exchanges have no use for it as they already do their own off chain transactions.
So my prediction is that it's gonna take a while, and maybe it won't be mainstream at all.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:34:43
A god damn good coffee that is
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:34
but if the solution is to use an Altcoin, what is bitcoin good for?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:55:46
For me it's more like Paypal, and when we have one big hub that most merchants are connected to, they can start censoring participants, or the Government can demand them to do it.

@_date: 2017-12-31 12:37:07
Sure, 1GB blocks now would be crazy. 8MB wouldn't. Increase 2MB a year wouldn't. 
Crazy is telling your Boss that while buying a new machine for your Database would keep your $200+ billion project working for a few years, because it's not a solution for 30 years into the future, you should risk losing everything out of principle instead of spend a few thousand on it.

Wait, isn't hash rate measured in TH/s? What's the % you're talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:33:23
At a fraction of the cost is very debatable. Visa, or any other payment processor is very efficient in doing it, Bitcoin in other hand does waste a shit ton of electricity to process a single transaction. And its obvious that it can't process nearly enough Visa.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:52
That's a very very stupid comparison. It can't and won't replace fiat.

Will you be able to solve the puzzle when you're 60 and haven't touched your coins in years?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:40:53
i disagree. there's nothing wrong in scaling for 100' tx/s for now with big blocks, until 2nd layer or other solutions are developed. 32mb are totally feasible for miners (disk space is their least concern), and with pruning full nodes can easily store the block chain. hell, even without, 10TB disks are cheap.
and nobody knows if LN will take off, so if it doesn't, then what?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:31:59
Sure, but most home connections can handle that even today, a couple of years from now it'll be even cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:04:25
Do you really think those numbers will be a big deal in the future? 
But being realistic, using the calculator it says that 8MB blocks would require only 3.2mbps, and allow for 200+tps (Without segwit).
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:42:05
So just like a pre paid visa?
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:09:45
It ain't "lazy", it's realistic. Here's how it works in every business out there: if your system is not keeping up with demand, and there is a short term solution, you deploy it while your engineers develop a long term one. There's a word for developers who don't solve crisis and ask their customers to wait for a possible solution maybe in the far future: unemployed.
"But but this is not a product, not a private business and the devs work on it for fun". 
Sure, if you forget they're actually funded by one agent or another, it's a different paradigm. Of course "customers" aren't customers and can't "demand" anything, and of course btc still is an experimental produc. But the project still obbey the laws of the market, and users will get fed up and move, regardless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:11:02
r/btc hacked. lol people got really salty didn't they?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:33:52

So you don't know math?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:17:46
There are tons of alts out there with different approaches, some don't even have fees. Nothing is required in this new world, and the majority could just move to some alt and never look back. I wouldn't take anything for granted.
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:17:33
Lol, you say that like the government has been taking people's car and houses away everyday. Name one case in your country. I live in a 3rd wolrd country with rampant corruption and i never saw that happen. Nobody's taking your house or your stocks. What happens is government blocking and seizing your shit if you had illegally obtained them, and only after you've been convicted (that's a long process).
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:50:34
It's more like a pre-paid visa for the final user. Then is like if visa has to route your payment to mastercard, they to amex, they to BoA thar routes the payment to the merchant's account. Everybody in the middle have these channels with each other funded with a shit ton of coins. If one of them don't route your payment, the next one has the right to get the coins from the main chain, like a collateral of sorts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:13:14
Ok, thanks, where can i see these numbers? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:07:12
Compressing all your files is tiresome, and many files are compressed already. Disk space is cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:10:41
Per transaction base is much much less. There's hardly any cpu usage to process a Visa transaction, it's mostly routing between acquirers and banks, and validating password and balances. The typical response time is around 1 second, and most of that is network delay.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:43:40
If it's trivial to attack, why hasn't anyone done it?

If you used any exchange you could buy it with safety.
Or can't you?

I was there, i was satoshi's dog and watched these events unfold
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:24:38
Bitcoin is very, very dangerous to use as a asset preservation mechanism. A billionaire will not do his own opsec, so will have to trust someone else. The fact that you can transfer everything without your lawyer involved, and the other part is just a wallet, means that if you get stolen, that's it, you can't even identify the wallet owner. So no, i don't think anyone is rushing to put their wealth on the chain.
Plus, most of their wealth isn't money, it's in shares of income producing assets, like stocks or private companies.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:30:13
That's not how it works fam
At least try next time, geez
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:02:39
Right now, Bitcoin isn't used for anything other than speculation. Maybe it'll all work out at the end, maybe not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:28:05
I understand if you buy most alts out there, but why the fuck buy Ripple??
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:02:47
You mean using the exchange like a bank? Keeping my coins there and trade for usable altcoins?
Why bother with all that hassle if I'm not the owner of my coins? I'd rather keep using my credit card and bank account, at least that is secured and i can get my funds back if the bank goes under or if my cc is stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:21:59

Honestly folks around here, did you expect that Bitpay, who process payments in Bitcoin, to just sit and watch their business going to ground because no one can use bitcoin to pay for things? they NEED people actually using bitcoin to pay for stuff, that's their business, so they have all the right to adopt usable coins, regardless of what the community here thinks about them.

You do own the stocks. You're a shareholder.
The car and house will be yours once paid.
In fact, both the house and stocks can't be stolen from you. Your car, your cash and your coins are easy to steal tho. The famous guy with a whrenth can force you to transfer your bitcoin to him, but he can't transfer the stocks or the house for him.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:35:16
so central authorities censoring is ok?
@_date: 2018-09-08 03:31:24

How do you take any positive about this? That was a clusterfuck, basically you had to get very lucky to find a shady startup business to accept your bitcoins after two days of searching and seriously risking being robbed the entire time (you wanna meet strangers you contacted on the internet to sell non refundable tokens in foreign country, seriously?). Bitcoin is 10yo and it's still this shitshow lol
