I'm saying that with how the current global economy works it requires growth which in turn requires spending. A large downturn in spending causes a downturn in growth which causes economies to collapse because the pyramid scheme starts to show. So I was wondering how you could structure the economy to keep this from happening.


My argument would be greatly affected by the actual rate of deflation.
Also thanks for the links.

How would an economy based on a deflationary currency work though? With inflation it forces people to spend and invest otherwise the value rots away in the bank. If it was in everyone's best interest to just hold currency over spending/investing then the economy would grind to a halt no? Would you happen to have any good articles on the topic?

One of the most mind blowing things I ever ran across is that dollars are backed and created by debt, the whole thing is a pyramid scheme.

I think you are right on this, the market moves with the herd, how can it be a bubble when most of the herd doesn't even know what crypto currency is. When the herd takes notice you can be sure the top is coming. I'm sure there will be major adjustments but it can only go up in the aggregate as long as more people keep piling on the train.

Why would you risk a billion dollar business to do shady shit when the government knows who you are and would be very happy to shut you down and throw you in jail for breaking banking regulations?

Oh I know all about how dysfunctional corporations can be, but coinbase is still in the startup phase rather than the too big to manage itself evil corporation phase. It's way more likely that their infrastructure buckles under load than all the conspiracy theories going on in this thread. On the other hand I could be completely wrong.

You do realize that when the price is plummeting it causes a huge amount of volume with people panicking right? No one is panic buying as the price goes up. Just go look at the volume on a chart it was insane during the last selloff and it's even higher today.
