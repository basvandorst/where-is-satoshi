LMAO at even mentioning iota, good luck with that. Seriously going to trust in devs who straight out lied to their own community to pump their coin’s value to make bank off false news and rumors. 
 
You don’t feel bad, you’re just incompetent.

Yeah, that was the refill number, not sell

You can short any instrument that allows trading on an exchange based market.

Not defending either side, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with being in this market purely for profit. 
People need to understand that as well. 
So essentially, we should try and understand both sides.

Absolutely have to agree with you agreeing with him. Especially since btc has entered other financial markets and is being exposed to the real world/daily life more than ever across the world.
(This also applies to crypto overall ofc!)

Look at hourly+daily. Looks like btc will have an enormous breakout to the upside quite soon. If it fails, it should test 10k before another bull run.

Took 3 weeks for me and over a month for a family member
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:40:29
Need to see if we hold at 12k or break further down before a bounce.

@_date: 2017-12-23 19:06:33
This is stupid money. Shorted from 20k and then bought again with those gains at 13k.
Can’t even tell what is real life anymore
