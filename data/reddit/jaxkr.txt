Don't try to trade. You're not going to make anything.
Just buy Bitcoin and hold onto it, and spend it if there is something you want to buy! It's a magic Internet currency, use it as one!
Welcome to Bitcoin! Have $1.

You can fund an account with Bitcoin, and the subscription will draw from that. That's how I pay for Spotify premium with BTC!
Buying gifts and redeeming them. However, it would be much easier to find my subscription with BTC directly.

Hey, thanks man!
I'll check there. I just needed more than 1.0 coins and I wasn't able to get that from faucets.
For a worthless currency, the faucets are surprisingly stingy because people abuse them. :(
Why? Come on people.
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:49:49
Extra hash: extra security.
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:54:41
Nice idea! However, 1 upvote is already a denomination.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:44:05
I got them! Thanks. You deserve an internet.

Use a mining calculator. Assume that you WILL lose your initial investment due to GH/s getting less valuable.
And it turns out, you will make profit, it just takes time.
I have invested 3 BTC, I currently have 2.5 BTC and I still have all my GH/s that are worth another 1.7 BTC. It turned 3 BTC into 4.2 BTC.
Take my word with a grain of salt though. You might not have the same results.

Harder to 51% the network.

Why aren't you hosting this on GitHub pages?
Also, why would someone install RoR instead of "python -m SimpleHttpServer" which is built into most systems...
Nice job on the app modifications though.
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:37:01
BitWallet can actually sign and send tx. It's just a weird method.
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:28:39
Yes. This is excellent advice. And you get about the same returns on smaller pools.
Have 1 upvote. verify
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:35:59
I understand your post. I was just pointing out that upvotes had a value that should maybe be higher than in your proposal.
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:55:02
And what changed your mind, out of curiosity?
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:37:35


Transmitting 1MB of data is faster and cheaper now than it was at the inception of Bitcoin. Also, keeping the 1MB blocksize limit hard-caps the growth of Bitcoin in terms of the number of transactions it can perform per-second on chain. Off-chain TX compromise what Bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:32:26
Really? I'm sure you'd be pissed having to spend $5 in tolls to go to the grocery store, or over $200 on a road trip. Or that nice $30k+ a year for a private school.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:00:16
You like driving on roads and public schools?
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:04:06


How so? Increased block sizes reduce the need for off chain transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:52:30


ah. you're mad because you were ticketed for a rolling stop or something like that?
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:07:08
I thought it has been merged with the blockchain.

This article has a lot of slight factual errors.
Other than that, thanks for sharing OP!

I literally JUST purchased a domain from them using Bitcoin. Went very smoothly.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:29:59

Yeah. Inputs is crap.

Wait what?  
That's huge! Doesn't an increase of 1 mean the the difficulty doubled? 2 is twice as hard as 1, 3 is twice as hard as 2.  
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:57:32
Probably Microtronix. That's who I use, and they're decent.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:31:31

Thanks. Sent email. Everyone else do it too!
@_date: 2013-06-19 22:33:21
I agree. It's much cheaper to buy a Raspberry Pi and run an Armory offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:46:16
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:53:22
Are the hint numbers in relation to anything?
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:14:39
Thanks for the thought, but Fab1an says the hint has nothing to do with the solution.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:25:37
Split it into multiple ZipZap emails.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:52:24
Yeah. But does four go with 5?

Awesome! :)  
How'd you transfer it with SMS? Who provides this?
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:46:16
So, shitty usage of Twitter Bootstrap? :P
@_date: 2013-06-09 00:33:28
Or Bitmessage.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:32:30
I was playing around with it and I thought it was cool as well. However, it's centralized and closed source.
@_date: 2013-06-19 02:41:43
It's nothing like twitter.  
It's like encrypted email that's decentralized and more powerful.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:42:33
Already tried asking them a while back. They refused.
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:21:41
This is awesome! So much better.  
Do you have any plans to release this on iOS?
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:57:41
Yes. This is most certainly the solution to nothing.
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:00:41
Nah. I'm just joking.
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:27:21
Well, it's completely untrue. I just did a bitcoin transfer on my iPhone using the latest version of Blockchain, and everything worked great.
@_date: 2013-04-21 06:04:13
What? If someone has that much power over the browser, they can do much worse than change bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:29:56
Yeah. It's an ISO compliant code because BTC is taken and Bitcoin isn't bound to a country. But XBT is taken too.
Might as well use BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:23:10
This is true, with the exception of Google Fiber.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:01:23
Question about four: Is it solvable without the hint? Or is Six = 3 a big part of the solution?
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:31:44
Or Electrum.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:58:01
Awesome! Thanks OP for sharing. May choose them as a host in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:49:38
Or Bitcoin &gt; Gyft &gt; Amazon

He's currently doing a crowd funding campaign: 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:19:09
That's almost $800.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:50:03
Not illegal for you, but for apple to publish. It goes against USA crypto exports. Can't export strong crypto to countries we aren't friends with, and since apple exports all their apps, that's where the problem lies.
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:40:54
As in, it generates vanity addresses?
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:55:48
2 or 3 weeks ago. Right in the midst of the hype.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:17:58
You have a good point.  
I'm not that opposed, but I don't like that the entire service is essentially an attack on the network.
@_date: 2013-05-19 13:26:44
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:57:57
You're contributing nothing to the conversation.
@_date: 2013-07-03 04:05:45
This one...
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:43:21
Something I don't understand: where do the reward coins come from?
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:38:39
Also, no blockchain download with Electrum.
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:28:21
I am currently using it. Very good site.  
However, inputs.io is a piece of crap overall. You shouldn't use a web wallet for any decent sum of money, period.
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:37:39


@_date: 2013-05-16 23:46:47
(no it doesn't)
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:23:39
Also closed source.
@_date: 2013-07-27 17:38:41
Electrum works just great for real life tx using the QR codes.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:26:49
Probably that "Six".length is 3.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:21:02
It backs up your encrypted wallet to the servers, which you can retrieve using a memorizable seed if you lose it.  
The convenience of a web wallet, and the security of a desktop client.
EDIT: No it doesn't I'm stupid.
@_date: 2013-06-30 07:10:10
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:41:49
I can confirm 3 is correct.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:44:56
Nah. Sent TX e772f08675577617cd7c75e7d2f7fa6e5aff69593a085363da0e5e50933eb8c3 to 16g7GaRzhMYF7ASChyqs2hvs6bvusEd44p, but no dice.
Then my comp crashed and the address changed. So no hint for me.
@_date: 2013-07-06 07:41:58
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:16:14
Spread it out. Put half in Bitcoin-Qt, and half in another wallet. I recommend Electrum.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:34:08
Yes. And it acts as a JSON RPC server.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:06:47
Great. What's the phone number for said Internet?
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:35:03
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:47:00
Or stone tablet and chisel.
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:16:31
However, Gliph does allow for sending of BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-23 03:15:45
I can do that with regular email too. It doesn't make email like Twitter.
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:25:39
Someone explain all those arguments please.
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:05:26
You can use it for gaming.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:03:42
Can you make "REDDITBITCOIN" a 10% off promo code? It would be fitting.
@_date: 2013-07-20 16:16:34
Electrum is good.
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:31:45
Isn't namecoin part of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:48:20
Macs are less likely to get malware simply because they have a smaller market share, but you should run a scan.
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:49:19
Woah what.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:56:06
Don't ever leave your Bitcoins in a web wallet. It's like leaving money in a public locker, that you rented a lock for. People are constantly jiggling the handle, and trying to just the lock.
Transfer it to a real client, such as Electrum. Then, it's like having a safe in your own home.
@_date: 2013-06-09 05:50:34
With the ADDRESS. Just generate a new address.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:52:55
Escrow, motherfucker. That's the solution.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:56:36
Psst. Just use BitInstant. You can physically go somewhere and hand someone money.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:35:28
I've read the whole thing, and thoroughly understood everything but the probability equations: :P 
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:30:38
This being the solution would make the puzzle unsolvable without the hint. [Fab1an said]( that the hint isn't an integral part.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:39:11
You can see the moment Satoshi dissapeared, and the moment they changed to GitHub.

C'mon. Just use Electrum. Much more forgiving and easier.
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:26:06
Thanks. Can you please tell me how it actually works?
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:10:00
It's possible, but ridiculously unlikely if the addresses are generated randomly.
To give you an idea of how many possible Bitcoin addresses there are, imagine a particle of flour. This particle represents 1 Bitcoin address. If you were to turn every possible Bitcoin address into a particle of flour, the flour would completely fill 225 Milky Way Galaxies.
