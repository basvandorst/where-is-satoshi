I guess that's exactly what I'm not understanding. If the idea is that if your paper backups become public (or compromised) that you have an additional security feature. Doesn't that replicate exactly what a brainwallet is?
edit: And if that's the case, why not just use a brain wallet to begin with. Knowing that it needs to be a high entropy passphrase
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:32:03
When has anyone ever implied that? That's ridiculous. You're basically saying that you think Bitcoiners are willing to give up their bank account PIN, due to torture. But for whatever reason wouldn't also give up their private keys.

So the best thing I can find as to why BIP38 is beneficial to a brain wallet is that with BIP38, you can create a multitude of addresses using the same passphrase. Something, clearly, impossible with a brain wallet. This is due to the fact that BIP38 uses a salt in it's determination of the BIP38 key. 
I'm not 100% in understanding exactly how this works. My thought is that you determine an initial salt value, then iterate it to create the other addresses. If someone could confirm, or provide information, about that. I'd appreciate it, thank you.

I understand that. This leads me to believe that a more secure solution would to have a BIP38 key, encrypted by a BIP38 key encrypted by a passphrase. Which as I'm sure you can see leads to a debacle of how many encryptions you need. 
What I'm trying to figure out, is if you have enough entropy in a brain wallet, is there any benefit for BIP38?
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:26:41
Did you read my post? The fact that BIP38 uses Scrypt doesn't matter. All you're trying do is find the private key. You use SHA256 for that. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:10:31
So essentially the security comes from the hidden secret key (safe, bank vault what have you) and the hope that the passphrase is sufficient in case that becomes compromised?
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:09:47
My fault. I misread your post as referencing the BIP38 key as the "protect key". 
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:14:44
This is simply not true. BIP38 is essentially a method for determining your private key. If a server farm happens upon your private key, there's no difference in the encryption you are using to determine it.
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:48:39
Exactly. What I was trying to understand is if there's some kind of benefit to BIP38 encryption, as opposed to brain wallets, besides the minor two piece encryption.
So it's correct to state that if your BIP38 private key becomes public, it becomes exactly the same as a brain wallet? In practice?
And if that's the case, then why not even worry about your BIP38 key becoming public ever and just use a brain wallet?

160 bits of entropy is not, in my opinion, that hard to obtain. According to [this article]( it would only require 27 case-sensitive alphanumeric characters. Although memorizing a random string of 27 characters would be arduous, it would be easily obtainable by memorizing a certain phrase and applying some sort of algorithm to change it to case-sensitive alphanumeric. 
For instance, you could use a phrase like "my favorite color is blue and roads are gray" Then decide that odd numbered letters in the alphabet are capitalized and Ts are dollar signs. So you get "MY fAvOrI$E COlOr IS blUE And rOAdS ArE GrAY" which has, I think, around 180 bits of entropy.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:42:44
I understand that. What I was asking is if you know the brain wallet Protect Key, does that somehow increase the difficulty of finding the passphrase. 
My thought is no, as it's all hashed together, so you just add the protect key to whatever phrases you are testing against.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:13:11
Additionally, you refer to it having only 9 tokens. Which is incorrect. Spaces also act as tokens, so it has 17 tokens. 9 of which are multi-letter words which would require an insane amount of computation to figure out. For example there's 454,230 four letter words in the english language. 
The idea that a passphrase of multiple sentences, that is not a common phrase, is easily found. Is ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:17:01
But BIP38 is just a method for determining the private key. Right? You don't necessarily need the BIP38 key and the passphrase. You only need the private key.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:22:02
I can see where you got that, but that's not what I meant. What I meant was that it's quite possible to remember some long string of words, that to anyone else would appear random. Much easier than remembering a string of letters number and characters. Each of with have the same entropy.

I'm just not understanding how BIP38 makes determining the private key, fundamentally, more difficult than anything else. Every single address has a corresponding private key. BIP38 is just a method for the user to find their private key. 
So again, if you use a completely random long passphrase as a brainwallet, isn't that essentially the same thing as using BIP38?
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:50:59
Which brings me back to the miscommunication we had a few posts ago. If a person has your BIP38 private key, is it more difficult to mine your passphrase? As opposed to a brain wallet?
@_date: 2014-08-24 21:20:24
[Bip 38]( is an example of the n-of-m type wallet you're looking for. Almost all of your issues are solved using online wallets. What I'm not understanding about your questions is that you want a local wallet to complete all these tasks, but you also want it to be easy to send and receive Bitcoin. That implies that you would always be at your computer whenever you wanted to send Bitcoin. 
The whole "mixing for anonymity" is not a standard option also doesn't make sense to me. Mixing is a service, so of course you have to use some provider to accomplish it. 
Of course I can't read a QR code just by looking at it. But Bitcoin is a digital currency. You have to have some device in order to issue a transfer, and almost any device has the ability to read a QR code.

Derive means to obtain from. Not generate. 
And I'm not arguing that a BIP38 password is harder to crack than a brain wallet password. That is, due to the algorithm, very true.
What I'm trying to get it is that given a passphrase with enough entropy (160 bits of entropy according to a brain wallet is exactly as difficult to crack as a BIP38 wallet. 
Your explanation that someone would need to physically hold your BIP38 wallet in order to obtain the private key is patently false. To reiterate what I've previously said; BIP38 uses it's generated key and your pass phrase in order to decrypt the original private key, corresponding to the public key address. If someone obtains the private key by some other means, it is no longer protected by the BIP38 encryption. Meaning that if I happened to type in a string of 256 characters, and that string happened to match the pre-determined private key used for your BIP38 key. I could steal the coins without ever knowing or caring that it was used to create a BIP38 key.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:51:28
I have read up on it. Which is exactly why I'm asking these questions. 
BIP38 absolutely is a tool to derive private keys. I'm not understanding what you think it is if not that. All it does is use SCRYPT to determine the private key from the BIP38 key and the passphrase. 
So what I'm getting at, is that BIP38 requires 2 things in order to access a private key. If either of which are lost or forgotten, you have no ability to access your coins. Whereas a brainwallet only requires a passphrase. And yes, someone could use a stupid passphrase which would easily be found. But if you use some long personal phrase, and change letters using some algorithm you come up with (in case someone thinks of the same phrase) it has the exact same entropy as BIP38 without needing a physical copy of a key.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:23:58
I think you're on to something here in terms of my understanding. How come knowing the protect key makes it more difficult to mine the passphrase? Is this true? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:20:25


Nor does your bank account. Although you can run the address you're curious about through a block explorer if you wanted


It's extremely simple. You exchange the private key and then they both have access to it. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by n-of-m address.


You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what wallets are. A wallet is a collection of addresses as the general principal is to not use an address more than once. Which is why when you send Bitcoin, it wants to send the change to a new address. 
If you're trying to show that the Bitcoins are coming from a specific entity, you would either make a note in the blockchain, or use a vanity address


QR codes


This is exactly what private keys are. Not to mention your wallet.dat file. Use basic backup strategies for either, and you're fine. Encrypt them any way you see fit and use the 3 2 1 method of backup


Most online wallets offer a mixer as an option. If you don't like that, then it's quite easy to find one yourself

My understanding is that BIP 38 uses a randomly derived private key, then encrypts it with a passphrase. 
A brain wallet hashes a phrase you determine in order to create the private key. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:00:14
Randomness does not mean it has to look like "0JMrb51f8yInxq5HqNB667pcPoI. A phrase can be random. Altering a phrase with a mnemonic is even more random. 
My example was only to illustrate a point. Not that someone should actually use something like that. However, I still don't see any difference in having a multi-sentence phrase, adjusted with a determined algorithm, and a random string of letters.
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:13:13
So what I really meant to ask is if you know the BIP38 private key, does that increase the difficulty in finding the BIP38 passphrase?
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:23:46
The difference is solved. And I knew what it was from the beginning. My question still remains as to why anyone would use BIP38 as opposed to a brain wallet.

Yes, I'm aware of the term. I was just using one of the options. 
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin works, as well as what people like are talking about.
DPR giving up his private keys has zero affect on anyone but himself. This whole "nail himself to a cross" thing that you repeat often doesn't really make any sense. 
What "rabid Bitcoiners" are saying is that there's anonymity in bitcoin addresses, as opposed to bank accounts, in which you could own something without anyone else ever being able to tell that you possess it. So what they're saying is basically that he alone had to knowledge to reveal his assets, and chose to give them up fully. It can be argued that he could still have some cache that no one but he knows about.

Truecrypt is done. It's now only useful in encrypting files for minimal security. [Thread](
