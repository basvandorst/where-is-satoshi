Getting a strong enough computer still doesn’t guarantee you bitcoin. You and many others are racing to solve a math problem . A lot of the people out there combine their hash power(computer power) solve then split whatever bitcoin they mine. Unless you spend tens of thousands for a rig and join a mining group, you’re not going to solve anything. Just have a giant electric bill at the end of the month .

What a newb lol! If the hashrate drops, so does the difficulty to mine. Just gives us little guys a chance to mine. Bitcoin will be produced every ten minutes regardless of hashrate.

There was a binance hack not long ago, and they covered all people who lost funds. Look it up. They returned all the coins were replaced

It had like a 600% gain in 5 months. Sell the news. Coins always dump after the actual halving. Of course there are variables. Nobody can predict the future. During the xrp swell conference the prize of xrp went up by 100 to 200% then it dumped as soon as the actual conference took place. Conference is is a week. Price still about the same. So you never really know. Though the volume today was the highest accounting for 50% of volume. They’re a cooking a something up

He played Steve Jobs in a bad movie and got into tech back in the day. He wanted to become Steve Jobs. He was also an early investor of SoundCloud if I’m not mistaken.

You absolutely should because if you hold btc, you’re increasing your chances of it succeeding and increasing the value of your holdings

@_date: 2019-01-23 11:11:00
Then why comment? If you don’t know what this post is about.. just assuming it’s promoting him. It’s just a story dude. And it’s pretty dumb to comment on something you don’t know about. It would be like me calling you a mamas boy before I even know anything about you. It’s like saying you’re small in the pants without actually having a look down there. ��

That’s probably why he exposed himself for not paying taxes and ran. Because he knew we’d make him follow through. Force him even..

They did this type of experiment on Netflix. They had a couple of people auditioning for a part, but also a few people in on the test sat with them.(they all sat in folding chairs in a room waiting) Every time there was a beep the actors stood up, then sat with a second beep. The people auditioning started standing up with the beeps too. They kept sending auditioneers into the room and took out the actors. Everyone kept standing with the beeps, but nobody knew why.
Edit: before the neckbeards get me, I know auditioneers is not a word.
