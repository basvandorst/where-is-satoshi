I lost 3 bitcoin a 6 months ago... I was very depressed. And angry, very angry. I tore through the whole damn house looking for my.cpld storage wallet. The house was a wreck, I was a wreck. I thought about suicide. All because of money??? Yeah it would have been really nice but money isn't everything. It was hard to get over but you will eventually. It still kinda hurts. I believe in the potential of crypto. It will be part of our future forever. So why not use these beautiful times we live in and take advantage of this mass adoption of crypto. I recently started investing /trading. I made a little bit  I haven't found my moon yet but I will. Now's the time to invest and learn to trade. These markets are fucking beautiful

Oh noooooo.... im sorry man. If it helps any. I made a dumb mistake myself abd loet 2.8 bitcoin. As someone that comes from a poor family. i finally made it. I know its not much but 2.8 bitcoin was the world to me. And i lost it.... suicide crossed my mind so many times but money isnt worth it.

I never said it's going to replace all currencies. It's paving a path for a new financial system though.
