I'm sure you have recieved allot of links and such but to sum it up he has been the longest and  most consistent but not politicised advocate for Bitcoin for many years, he had made a career out of it but only through much perseverance, and ironically has sold much of his early coin to continue his mission and exist
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:49
Lol, irony

Thank you, that greatly clarifies it for me, I had only heard that osx was based on Linux and it's usually said in a derogatory fashion

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't litecoin btc 2.0.  Bitcoin was first and kitchen is an improvement,. Vertcoin is kind be of the ethical spin-off.  Bitcoin didn't necessarily deserve to be first

Maybe, this is just regular weekend fluctuation, but it could spooked the herd Monday and make The Dip.    But then the wiseguys will put REAL money in when it settles low btween 3-8k. Usd for a bit.    And the low buys will spike it back up for the next ride
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:03
Well your locked into the price when you bought it, so it's a forced hold and will probably be back up higher by the time it clears, just buy more low, or ignore the news for a bit!
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:40:36
If it's value is based on its growth and adoption then the ceiling would still be far away, if fiat currencies are backed by trust in a state entity then Bitcoin is backed purely by it's use.

Actually tbh, I think before Asian markets open tomorrow I'll buy some, but I think the weekday will bring it back up again.   Or Monday will be the real dip, once the herd gets spooked,.  And then I buy again !

I think tx for transactions/ tx for maintaining ledger

What bothers me the most is that the bcash guy owns bitcoin.com and uses it to confuse the issue further
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:27:24
So is the the big dip/ correction everyone was talking about?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:06:03
Imagine the religiousness that would follow if Satoshi bought a cup of coffee with one of his bitcoins, or bought a litecoin/eth whatever.

What I mean by internet and cellphones won, is that the pyramid scheme was selling these landline phones with screens on them that only worked it the other house had the landline phone with a screen.   The concept was ok but landline phones lost to smartphones and computers
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:42:13
This was my first thought, thank you
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:41:40
VOIP was the tech, the product was TV phone on your landline
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:34:13
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:06:04
Also the guy who is pushing "Bitcoin cash" wns Bitcoin.com, and actively uses it to confuse, this to me is the shadiest part

I remember my mom got me in a peanut scheme meeting about VOIP,. And I tried to get my cousins to buy a VOIP phone so we could do video calls cuz it was the future.  Probably 2003ish?  The internet and smartphones obviously won, the company wasn't wrong, but the were more concerned about getting rich will than introducing new tech for real
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:53:22
I thought they were selling when it comes dipped because that is when there is demand to take that many coin
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:29:20
It's also great for reinvesting your vices when the price tanks, while everyone else gets drink and smoke while updating process they are spending more free money at a discount
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:10:40
Yes my biggest takeaway from that was the markets of btc is down to 1/3
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:18:11
Truth, but I wish I understood pricewalls and whale wieght enough to say if they were able to push prices up and down during the 5-9k roller coaster before it recently stabilized.   I'm not wearing a tinfoil hat, I'm just putting tape over my webcam

I know what it is I just wish I understood it on a fundamental and mathematical level. If I was going to go back to school it would be for statistics
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:45:05
The reason this was done was that it was a proprietary device that goes on your landline, this was before cell phones were popular or smart
