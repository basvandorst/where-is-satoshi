How is it semantic? Just because B is more risky than A does not mean A is not very risky as well.
Options are highly leverage. Most people use it as insurance against or for their positions, not flat trading them.

Your slavery comparison is not valid, it has very little connections to the topics at all. 
It doesn't matter whether you give someone controls or not, someone will receive them either way. Human is a social animal, and as long as grouping up gives an organization greater power, it is just a matter of time before consolidations. This is why I believe any sort of anarchist society does not work in the long run, albeit possible for a short term. The line between private and public is very thin when it comes to controlling power
However, anarcho-capitalism itself is a contradictory, similar that to true communism; It is an ideal that can never pane out in reality. t

You're double counting. Why would you get penalized at the same time also getting penalized for receiving?
The burden should be shared by the payer and receiver, so 1.5% on each of those transactions for 3% total on spending and receiving (using your example).
The thing is though, everybody wins through credits. It's been shown that customers spending inceases with credit, enriching both the business and CC. The increased in economic activities also helped out consumers in the long run

Not even close, and how the hell does that prove your point? Just because they are more risky than bitcoin does not mean "bitcoin is not very risky". So everything less risky than "naked short options" is consider not risky for you? That is what you've implied in your posts.
Beside the point,
Forex are highly leveraged but movements are limited. A weekly or even monthly option of a second derivative is far more risky than Forex.


Buying options on a oil triple leveraged etf (or a derivative of one)

Actually the average balance (of all age groups) for 401k accounts is 100k; Most Americans do have saved up more than 100k into retirements.
Which is still pretty sad tbh, but even lower wage earners can achieve this goal by forfeiting some leisure. e.g delay marriages, take up extra hours, self-educate, professional schools etc.

It's still not semantic, because your comparison is retarded. That's not how risk analysis works.


Do you not realize how stupid this sounds? Bitcoin is very risky and is what a"real risk" looks like. It's akin to saying that Forex is not risky because oil triple leveraged etf/future or second derivatives.

So you only want to pay for things that you agree with?
Nothing will get done in a society with that mind set.
"I don't have children, so I don't want to pay taxes for schools". "I ride bikes, don't need a car so no roads for me" "Who needs firefighters? I got nothing of value, sucks to be my neighbors though"

Overstock will go bankrupt far before Amazon ever will if they initiate a price war, as Amazon have the pricing power and network that overstock cannot compete. I doubt Amazon would care given the scales, though.

Too much potential conflicts and risks associated with P2P loans. Normal people simply does not have the time, skill, or stomach to analyze the risk associated with loans.

It is quite the other way around. Stores pays their local gangs I mean law enforcement company for protections, or said stores ceases to function.
When you have sticks and manpower, people obey and funnel money to you. That's how countries are formed in the first place. They all are segregated into small factions that eventually falls to the guy with bigger stick. Whoever have the strongest power is the ruler, not the peasants that feeds the money to him.
Monopoly is a naturally occurring event. As long as people can organize into a bigger mesh, they will always have greater power than the sum of both once smaller mesh.

Well when you take average of all household, you're going to get a very low number as many people would be in debt or $0 acct.
Around 55% of Americans have 401k accounts, and the average account balance is 100k. Hence, majority of Americans will have 100k+ by retirements (avg is $150k for 65+).


Saving 10% a year is definitely not pushing it as single, and honestly if your career path is a flat $20k you need to consider changing your career and delay marriages/other obligations to find better opportunity.

I doubt you know what you're talking about either. Anything that can lose or gain 50% in a year is by the definition of very risky.
Just because some options plays are more risky doesn't change that fact. Options are quite great for offsetting risks, not for you to gamble with.

No it won't. Tax for countries comes mostly from top earners, and gov knows exactly how much individuals and companies need to pay each year earn based on their salary and assets.
Might be easier for low income class to dodge taxes, but they've never been much of a contribution either way.

There will always be rulers and those who are ruled. Anarchy always results in segregated society until one of the warlords get big enough to consume the rest.
And that's never a pretty process.

I don't see how private court could possibly work. Who decides which private court to go to? I'm sure the defendant and prosecutor would have different opinion.
