You are right to just wait, or find another investment if you can't be bothered with paper wallets.   The time will come when storing coins will be AOL easy, but if you can't/won't deal with paper wallets now, you might not have the skills to safely participate at this stage.

No Tor and my btc went straight into a paper wallet for hodling. ~15% success rate, only the first two transactions, after that, zero successful transactions.

1) you need an offline copy of bitaddress.org on a new sd/flash drive
2)You need a secure machine- Run a Linux live OS (TAILS is preferred OS) or fresh windows install
3)follow instructions of offline copy of bitaddress.org on secure machine,  never connecting to Internet
4)you need a "dumb" printer or to hand write the private and public keys generated by bitaddress.org
My advice if the above seems daunting and if you have ~$20USD, buy a Ledger hw.1 and ledger initialization device which will guide you into creating a paper wallet backup or ledger nano s which comes ready to go.  Good luck!

I appreciate your response, but remain unconvinced. 
In a macro sense, Snowden's leaks have done beautifully for the feds; the programs are still running and now they are publicly tolerated.  Outcry was anticipated, and metered.  Image can be repaired when spying is the norm.
 
Before the leaks,  the obvious (to my tinfoil hat mind) but secret spy programs were a dangerous powder keg. Now the spy programs are being debated and validated in mainstream politics.  This is how the programs become law. 
How would you introduce the subject of mass survelence programs to the public if not from a  "people's hero"?

As I understand this attack, OP used cell service text messages as his 2fa. OP's cell service was spoofed through social engineering. The attacker received 2fa sms code, then changed OPs Bitstamp account settings to turn off 2fa. If OP had used Google Authenticator or Authy, the attacker could not have executed this attack, so yes choosing 2fa other than sms matters here.

You can't.  Maybe miners can if the entire Internet infrastructure is not broken by alphabet agencies. This is my understanding after asking this question to r/bitcoin. If you have a specific level of anonymity you wish to obtain or attacker you wish to defeat,  you can accomplish modest goals with p2p exchanges.

Bitcoin halving mischaracterized into what seems like central bank inflation control:
 "Bitcoin miners are rewarded with a set of bitcoins for each block they successfully mine. Miners used to receive a bounty of 50 bitcoins, but this was halved in 2012 to prevent bitcoin inflation and it is expected to halve again in the coming months, potentially leading to supply-side currency constraints.
