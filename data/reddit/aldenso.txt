Says the guy posting a thread about his bitcoin price predictions in an attempt to hold the price up.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:15:37
Were you on my side? Now i'm lost and confused.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:58:02
You think this is a dip? Lol. See you at 8k.
Also, I've never been a proponent of holding.  So stupid. It's so obvious when big things are coming, why not sell at 17k and buy back in at sub 10?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:12:30
If you bought at such a great price then why are YOU so salty about people cashing in profits?
And when you can't be pro BTC on the BTC subreddit something is strange indeed, maybe a huge price correction at the cost of the mindless hodlers.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:56
How much have you donated to the lightning development?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:08:13
That's a fucking lie and you know it.
You are NOT in it for the principal, you're in it in hopes to be an easy millionaire, just like the rest of us, just like most people who have been in bitcoin, and just like everyone who bought it after 10k.
You're either lying to yourself/us or are a part of the minuscule  minority that actually give a fuck about what Satoshi was trying to create.
Fuck off with the bullshit.

I was actually asking about the one in Toronto, but thanks for your help!
I found the Toronto one and it was an overall great experience.  I got to chat with some awesome people including Anthony Di Iorio, and Vitalik Buterin.

We are a community surrounded by delusional people.
I think my last 4 posts in r/bitcoin have been talking about people's delusions.
Even if this was MK fatty, he's been doing/saying everything in an attempt to save his own ass, and repeatedly these people believe him.
Starting with blaming hackers, then making it appear they were going to be bought out, then that transactions were around the corner, then making it look like "hot wallets" were being tested, and now this.  GET A GRIP, YOU'RE LISTENING TO A CON ARTIST.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:14:04
I don't see how more people don't understand this! The last thing he did before he filed for bankruptcy was pretend that gox was being bought out...and somehow people STILL trust him after everything.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:00:59
Why do you only have one glove? Go buy some alpaca gloves at least!
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:44:05
This is good news, actually.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:59:27
He just posted 10 minutes ago a bit further down in here saying that "the site is probably just down."

@_date: 2014-01-28 15:14:18
Do you know where Toronto's is located?  Bitcoiniacs doesn't say any locations other than the BC ones.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:00:06
Thank you very much for the response!  I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:03:33
Ya, let's believe the business owner who tried to make it seem like MTGox was getting bailed out.  He's a truthful person.  /s
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:05:51
This represents half the community, the other half somehow still believe him and trust him to fix this.  Which is absolutely insane.
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:34:26
How much % are coins marked up from these ATMs? Can someone give me an answer? I've looked everywhere and ask in every ATM post and no one seems to know.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:20:55
You should really donate if you don't care about getting rich and you care more about the tech surviving and advancing.
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:32:13
Missed by 85. Dang. You're a saint and way to spread the wealth! Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:41:33
When people click these posts and see that most of the comments are FOR BTC-e they'll hopefully choose to trade there.
BTC-e is great.  The volume is spectacular, the anonymity is one of a kind, and the troll box is great fun.
Everyone: USE BTC-e!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:18:37
Do you know where it is? I can't find the info everywhere, google just leads me to news articles.
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:40:35
This is insane, I can't find an answer anywhere.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:25:00
You've got something here.  Don't wait for the feedback, because it will be too late.  Get on it now.
Plus, every comment here is extremely positive, (other than that one hater down low).
Make it happen!
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:21:39
Does anyone know the fees associated with these atms as someone buying BTC from them?
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:50:57
Wasn't being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:51:14
Just had to deal with customer service at coinbase.  What a nightmare!
First response I got took a few hours and I thought "great, this is way better than what people claim."
Then I had to send 4 more messages over 3 days and a new ticket to get a response back on the first ticket.
They answered, barely, and could have helped a lot more.  3 days later and I dealt with it myself.
An absolute joke, garbage customer service.  Took my Bitcoin out and will never be going back.
I didn't even go to them by choice, overstock sent my coins there because they didn't confirm fast enough (my fault, I know) but they could have at least asked where I want my refunded coin.
Anyway, never will I go back to coinbase.

Everyone seemed to care a whole fucking bunch before it got disapproved.
This sub is exactly like Trump supporters.  No matter what happens it's always the plan and always what's best.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:02:03
No, but when big shit happens it's pretty easy to see what's going on.  I have barely been paying attention to Bitcoin lately but I knew I needed to sell soon so I spent and sold.  If I buy back in right now I'll have made money.
I just saved a bunch of money on my new laptop!
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:54:24
I'm so stupid and know so little about Bitcoin that I'll make 20% if I buy back in right now. I'm dumb. Don't be like me.  Hodl!!!!!!!  
Edit: oops, I should pay more attention to Bitcoin.  25%.  Don't listen to me!  
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:12:17
I don't get any of these "hodl" posts.
Why the hell would you hold?  Sell and buy back lower.  Make money.
I'm happy I sold.  I'm going to come back in with more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:45:29
If you bought in low you can have more money selling highs and buying lows.
If you bought in high you can save some of your losses by selling at a small loss and buying back in lower.
I believe in the idea of Bitcoin and want it to succeed, but why the hell would you pass up on making more Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:15:19
Find someone who can fix it and let me know the cost. I'll pay for it for half the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:35:27
Bring it to a computer store and ask them if it's fixable.  You won't pay for it until after it's done, so if it doesn't work you probably wont have to pay.
Don't tell them there are BTC on it or they'll keep it and tell you it's un-fixable.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:58:23
But then sometimes it's not enough and your money is sitting there in limbo for three days. Really makes Bitcoin look bad when I tell my friends that I'm paying for something on overstock with Bitcoin and then it takes nearly a week to get my money back to my wallet due to all the complications.
And then next time I send the money I nervously sit in front of the computer waiting for it to get confirmed because I don't want to wait another 3 days to try again.
I've had great experiences with Bitcoin and I've had bad experiences.  It's just propaganda if we upvote this and say, "see, Bitcoin is awesome" and then ignore the issues.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:08:48
It's because 80% of people don't give a shit.
People need to stop denying the fact that most people are in Bitcoin because they think of it as a way to get rich quick.  They think it's going to blow up again like it did a few years ago.
Deep down most people don't give a shit if Bitcoin becomes adopted by the world.  Most people aren't in this as a way to make money exchange easier.  If people were told that Bitcoin was going to stay at $1200/per but adopted across the world no one would care. 
Most people are only in it because they see it as a lottery. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:48:01
Sorry to derail this topic, but wtf does this mean?
I support and own bitcoin, but I have no clue wtf is going on here. Should I know and understand?
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:20:30
Lol why would you tell everyone how much bitcoin you have?
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:07:11
It is, but I lost all my free-plays and regular plays...LAME
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:05:17
You clearly need an editor.
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:58:02
Secondy third place.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:07:47
This just goes to show how delusional some users are.
Banning posts isn't going to cause some voodoo magic spell to drive prices back up.
This just solidified what I believed; that most people in this subreddit thought they'd be driving a lambo to school this January.
Ps. The bubble popped! Sell sell sell!!!
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:48:04
So now that I have bitcoins on the site and it's 404'd what do we do?
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:07:59
Do you have enough to pay out the jackpot if someone wins it?
Edit: And is there anyway to either change tickets back to BTC? or change to different stakes?
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:08:01
Why don't you take out a gigantic loan and buy as many btc as you can, then claim bankruptcy?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:06:56
This isn't biased in the least!
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:38:43
How the hell are people supposed to believe bitcoins are safe and secure when you can trace them to who sent them?  Won't the governments be doing this?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:01:42
Because upvotes and downvotes don't already control what people like to see.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:47:35
I'm glad to see you aren't diversifying!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:24:29
I wish there was a way to know how many people are pump and dumpers and how many aren't.
I don't know one person who is in this to cause world change and not to get rich, I'm just not afraid to admit it.
I be willing to say 99% of all of you are pump and dumpers.
Upvote me if you are and pump and dumper and would like to be driving a Ferrari next spring, and down vote me if you want to change the world and make transactions safer, easier, and cheaper.
This just continues on my belief that people are just delusional about this whole cryptocurrency thing.
I, for one, fully admit I'm just here to get easy money.
