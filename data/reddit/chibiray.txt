If they really wanted a full collaboration, they should also invite founders of the top cryptocurrency coins in the market. Not just a closed off room with bankers and governments that only have their best interests in mind. This is why cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.

I'm not arguing whether or not you need to pay taxes because obviously you do. I'm talking about at what step are you obligated to. I would argue that it's when you decide to switch from btc to fiat currency. I would also go as far to say that if you convert btc to alt coins you're not on the hook for the taxes yet even if your position has increase because the investment is still ongoing.
Capital gains tax applies when you "sell a stock at a gain" in our case it's "sell cryptocurrency for a gain". The word sell implies from asset to fiat. This does not apply to asset to asset conversion (since IRS labels cryptocurrency as an asset) which is basically what happens when you are changing btc to alt coins. (Because there is no fiat middleman needed). Easier to think of cryptocurrency world as one big stock and the only real gain/losses is considered when you decide to switch back to fiat currency.
This is also why many people choose to never convert their coins back to fiat currency to avoid the taxes in the hopes that one day btc will be mass adopted, but I'm sure the government will eventually find a way to get their share of taxes even if you try to do that.

stocks are different since you can't do a straight up trade from one stock to another. You have to use fiat as a middleman. Cryptocurrency doesn't do this.

I'm assuming when he means taking out from exchange you are converting btc to fiat. Unless your government takes taxes in the form of bitcoin, I don't see how they can get taxes on gains until you make the exchange and send it to your bank.

It's a special pencil that emits orgone energy! Lol did you see that stuff they sell on Amazon. Literally resin with scrap metal.
Anyways, I'm just just yanking your chain. Haha. I'm sure if you get a good lawyer you can argue your way through loopholes.

What constitutes as a business vs personal investor? He doesn't own a shop, met with people like you would on Craigslist. Sounds pretty personal to me.

Interesting read. Thanks dude! So what we need to do is similar to what the Japanese does with pachinko. Trade bitcoin paper wallets for some items that are not worth anything and then sell said item for fiat currency.
You can also rip the paper wallet in half. Half of a paper wallet is worthless, but combine the two and.. You get the point.
So plan is simple, I have a paper wallet with btc inside. Rip paper wallet in two, each piece is useless and worthless on its own. Trade one piece for a pencil. Pencil gets bought for $3k. Do the same with the other piece. It's a roundabout way of doing things, but you can make it as simple or complex as you want. I don't think there is a law that says I can't sell items for whatever price people are willing to pay for it.

what if he said Bitcoin was a collectible? Wouldn't it just be the same at that point as selling stuff on craiglist?

I didn't know the US acknowledged that Bitcoin was a currency, I thought they categorized it as an asset. Isn't that the reason why they wanted capital gains tax?
What's stopping us from saying bitcoin is a collectible if we printed out a paper wallet. Wouldn't it just be another craiglist type of deal?
