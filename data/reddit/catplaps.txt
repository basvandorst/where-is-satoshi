speculator here. my strategy, approximately speaking, is to hold a constant percentage of my portfolio (denominated in USD) in BTC. in other words, i don't expect to ever withdraw the USD that i have paid into the system.
let's say that my total portfolio is $100k, and that i purchased 10 coins at $1000 each. tomorrow, BTC goes up to $2000, leaving me with $20k of BTC and $90k in other assets, for a total of $110k. to rebalance, i would sell off $9k, or 4.5 coins, and put the proceeds into my other assets. that leaves me with 5.5 coins, or $11k in BTC.
i get my profit, *and* my investment increases proportional to my net worth. don't see how this is anything but good for the system.

correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe that donating bitcoin falls under the IRS rules for [donation of appreciated property]( now. in other words, not only do you get to deduct the full value of the donation, but you don't have to pay any capital gains on the donated property.
(obviously this is US only, and IANAL, etc.)
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:24:03
you're probably just trolling, but i'll lay it out anyway in case it helps others.
donation of appreciated property (usually stocks) is an excellent tax "loophole" for people who are sitting on capital gains and who also like to give to charities (like the EFF). it stretches your donations a lot farther than they would go otherwise, dollar for dollar.
this sub is probably full of people who are sitting on bitcoin capital gains, and i'm guessing more than a few of them are new to the game of portfolio tax efficiency. if you're in the US, and you intend to follow the law, this stuff is a big deal. it should absolutely affect your investing and spending decisions.
also, i'm going out on a limb here and guessing that a lot of people in this sub support the EFF. they do a *lot* of good.

specifically, i'm talking about US-based exchanges and other investment products like the ETFs. right now, if i wanted to place a limit order to sell my coins at $x, i would have to entrust my money to some random company in a foreign country where i have basically zero legal or monetary recourse. i'd do that with a hundred bucks, but not with a million. the market becomes a little more attractive when the people who hold your money can actually be sued and sent to jail if they steal it.

with dell, newegg, overstock, expedia, cheapair... it's really getting to the point where you don't have to go out of your way to spend bitcoin. (in the US, anyway.) if someone got paid in bitcoin on a craigslist sale, odds are good that they could directly spend it on something they need without ever converting it to USD at all.
@_date: 2014-05-16 04:41:32
that... doesn't make sense. there's no such thing as magical bitcoin dollars. "bitcoin denominated in dollars" *is dollars*. that's what their answer says, too: if you hold an amount denominated in dollars, they hold dollars to back it up. it turns into bitcoin when you convert it or send it to a bitcoin address.
not saying there's no value to an easy to use storage/conversion system. if it's safe and simple and fast, awesome.

here's my advice: play with this changetip first and treat it like it's your actual savings. create whatever wallets you want to use and practice moving the funds between them. look at each device or piece of paper and ask, "what if it broke? what if i lost it? what if someone hacked it/photographed it/stole it?"
personally, i keep my hot wallet in mycelium (with paper and electronic backups), and my cold wallet is a BIP0038 encrypted paper wallet, with three physical copies stored in various safe places.

me too: i'm primarily in it as a speculator. i think it will become much more useful and much more valuable over the next few years, enough that i'm willing to put a substantial wager on it.
i have started suggesting it as a payment option for my craigslisty type transactions, because i would LOVE to drive a stake right through paypal's black, twisted heart, but so far, no one has taken me up on it.
i have purchased about $100 worth of miscellaneous crap from overstock, tigerdirect, etc., mostly for the fun of it. it was fun-- spend magic internet money, receive tangible object!-- but it doesn't directly improve any consumer experience for me yet. if the places i order from overseas start accepting it, that would be a genuine improvement.
EDIT: i also solo mine, partly out of a vague sense of public responsibility, partly due to being entertained by the technical details, and partly for the distant but thrilling chance of finding a block.

there are at least four questions here:
- how should i invest $x that my family depends on?
- when/how should i own up to having lost part of $x on bad trades?
- how big of a role should active trading play in my portfolio?
- what does the crystal ball say about future bitcoin prices?
let's handle  first. go read boglehead forums and learn how to "get rich slowly" with diversified investments before going any further. seriously, if this doesn't guide 90%+ of your strategy, you're fish food.
 part A: you will have to tell your family at some point that you have lost a lot of the money. it's inevitable, so don't sweat it, just start thinking about what it means to them, what they'll think, what they'll say, and be ready for it. part B: write up what you've learned, describe your future strategy, and apologize. write this all down. it'll help everyone.
 dude, you already know the answer. set your "play money" limits and stick to them. if you can't stick to them, quit this shit cold turkey and realize that if you ever go back, it will eat you.
 go read and realize that no one really has a clue unless they're actively manipulating the market, trading on insider information, or selling shovels.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:52:18
Yes. Your "gain" in this scenario is an increase in basis from 500 to 2900 on those 5 BTC, i.e. there are less latent taxes lurking in your bitcoins now because you already paid them.
This is a dumb strategy, FYI. :) Opposite of loss harvesting. If you did it the right way, to realize a loss and then repurchase, that's called a wash sale and the IRS is already wise to you. Ha ha.

with an attitude like that, you should count yourself lucky to be at break even. also, your meager 50 coins just went up $5000 in value in the past week. take a break, go outside, stop checking the price for a couple days or a couple weeks, and rethink this whole game, because you're playing to lose right now.
**EDIT:** 
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:44:26
Your math is wrong. If you buy BTC at 500 and sell it (or "sell" it) at 500, no gain/loss, no problem. No gain/loss for your friend, either, since he's buying at market price. Now, I'm assuming your example implies that the market value will go up, and that you'll buy (or "buy") the coins back at a higher price. If you do, then no gain/loss, no problem. Your friend will have a gain and must handle it appropriately. In this example, you're *actually* not making money, because you're paying out USD at the higher USD/BTC rate for the second transaction. The gainer is the hypothetical friend. So: if that's an actual human on a boat in international waters, good for them, they pocket a profit tax free. If your "friend" is some sort of proxy for an account you control i.e. your friend's gain is really your gain, then you're just playing the old hide-gains-in-offshore-accounts game, and good luck to you. If it's something in between, say an actual friend who agrees to kick back his profit to you in some other way, then you're just reinventing money laundering.
tl; dr: You owe taxes on the actual gains you make in USD and goods and services, period.

the "consumer protection" point has two solutions that i see: (1) sue the jerks. you can prove that you paid them. (obviously gets expensive and complicated when you go international.) (2) pressure sellers to use an intermediary BTC-&gt;BTC payment processor that adds its own layer of consumer protection, just like credit cards or paypal do. (obviously this comes with fees. consumer protection in general requires human intervention and thus requires fees.)

false. what it actually is:
* "an investment strategy for reducing the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets" ([wikipedia](
* a common practice for people who invest a little each month, e.g. from a paycheck
DCA isn't magic. it reduces both the potential downside and the potential upside. you can think of it as a mild form of [martingale betting](
for those who believe "you can't time the market" (myself included), then the optimum behavior is always to invest the entire amount you want to have in a particular asset as soon as you can, as long as you think that asset is worth owning. in other words, sitting on uninvested cash is always a losing play. (unless you're timing the market, in which case, have fun.)
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:47:31
i think the requirement of a license to "issue" a "virtual currency" is literally nonsense and cannot be interpreted as applying to anything. the satoshi paper describes a system that has no inherent monetary value. the way that it acquires monetary value is by individuals who decide that they are willing to exchange it for goods, services, and other valuable things. (and for the most part, these individuals are specifically excluded from the regulations.)
other examples that reduce to absurdity:
who "issues" gold? (note that miners are specifically excluded as well; they are not "issuers".)
since there are people who have decided to trade world of warcraft gold for real money, does this mean that blizzard will be required to apply for a license in NY to "issue" gold pieces?
if gift cards (unique IDs redeemable for a certain value) are traded between two people, are they suddenly a virtual currency? is olive garden or home depot now a virtual currency issuer?

it's an interesting thought: changing the donations playing field. i think there's a real disconnect between a "donate" button and making it personal. ads sort of make it personal without consent; a donate button has to work for it, or forever disappear into the background.
brainstorming strategies here. what if the donate button came with something targeted to whatever you know about the user, like ipgeo. say they're in romania, and you have 1000 unique views/mo from romania, which roughly equates to $x/mo in hosting costs for that region. you could keep track of donations for that region and show the disparity: "hello, romania! your donation/hosting cost ratio is 0.6. donate here to help cover our costs and remove ads for your whole region!" follow through, remove ads for any region that's above 1.0 for that period, and add a kudos message instead of a beg. play on local pride and also make it personal. adjust region sizes bigger and smaller based on unique views, e.g. if the bay area is 50% of views, split up their accounting by zip code, while all of indonesia might be one region.
