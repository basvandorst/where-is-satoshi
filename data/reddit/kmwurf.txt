Just make the material emmisive  and use cycles, so you can set the background to alpha but the emmision color is still rendered over it.

It is basically an progressively rendered "Buddhabrot Fractal" in HTML5/Javascript 
The Coloring of a point follows a simple mathematic formula. On  which one can decide whether a point is moving from an origin to inifinity or is staying in a certain area.
Benoit Mandelbrot (also wiki him)   described it once like this:
Imagine an plate with fleas in the center of the plate.
Now they start to jump for a givenn umber of times by a certain amount in a direction described by a formula .
So we see them jumping an jumpin all over  ... some start to fall of the plate after only 2 jumps. They create black spots.
Others tend to jump in infinetly small steps  creating a brighter color.
and after lets say 1000 jumps we look at a pretty nice fractal image.
Thats was just in a nutshell an description about fractals.
Have fun to proceed in a world of Math.

I think there is a major structural defect in you mind.

The question is why does bitcoinQT have to mangle around so much on the hard drive ?
What is the size of the current blockchain...wasnt it something around 5-6~Gb ?  
If so ...why not caching  it into mem ? 
Does anybody have a link to the algorithm that is running to proccess the blockchain ?
Im just smelling opimization here.

German here trading bitcoins my advice get a lawyer who knows financestuff especially on the case of not being able to pay the house,you could even get compensation when someone else would buy it and you were not able to since your account was frozen) and one laywer who knows the internet further than outlook and google  ;)
