Call their support it might be defective or Our phone bfc cheap 
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:18:54
Ask the guys at blockonomics (I think)  how they did it maybe... They have such a feature 
@_date: 2016-04-07 10:51:50
Using it as my main storage solution in combination with mycelium. I find it very practical once you understand that you should lay the phone flat on it over a table and not move them until your operation is finished, otherwise you get communication errors (especially if like me you have a thick cover on your phone)
@_date: 2016-04-27 18:15:06
Don't they support xpubkey scanning ?
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:37:29
Also it feels like they buy our coins at a very advantageous rate (for them), which brings us closer to 1.5 - 2 %.
Maybe they should use Kraken and not Spectrocoin as the underlying exchange.
@_date: 2016-04-28 06:03:38
Great service that should get you sorted quickly !
@_date: 2016-04-08 18:19:45
You're not really suppose to use it like your visa card... Get a daily use wallet with a little bit of btc in it and leave the rest protected by your ledger 
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:43:39
I could repurpose an old tablet with this same concept ...

Thanks that's very enlightning !
@_date: 2016-04-29 05:36:43
The way HD wallets are done,  you usually have only 20 non used addresses to monitor...  But then again it's quite possible to do anything with them.  Good luck finding the best way to do this 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:52:44
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:56:42
I guess it's a good thing that people try to understand how it works and compare it to what they know about the current financial system (what they now of it, at leat)

@_date: 2015-12-09 18:09:31
This is a really cool project !

Which feels to me that a stable price is actually a very good sign of constant adoption ... 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:11:07
Point which is not relevant if they used a payment processor as bitpay ... As you suggested first.

I kind of wonder how do you open a PayPal account without a bank account? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:45:20
No you just need a banking license if you hold fiat for your customer's...  Buying ans selling as a moral person is permitted if you register as a money transmitter

All security issue will soon be greatly reduced by the adoption of multisign services (wallet, apps, exchanges , etc ...)
Don't keep you coins on exchanges, solutions exists for easy and secure cold-storages.

If you're not US citizen, you can contact those guys: 
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:24:00
Yes but never store them there...  Is it that difficult to understand? 
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:27:54
You're welcome, any comments is welcome (typos, potential improvments, errors ...)
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:53:00

Maybe by not having to spend a lot of time cashing in every drink you serve as a bar tender, you would have more time to spend talking to customer / making mojitos with less stress and more love? Overall making it a cooler experience for both you and your customer...

I think I'll first make public the auto-deploy script I'm working on, with a donation button. Later on if there is demand, I will offer the possibility to deploy a few node as POC.
Btw, I registered bitcoin-nod.es , so in the future one can have a redirect like : mynode.bitcoin-nod.es 
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:24:42
Soon we gonna have to organize events in parks and square ! =)

Owning and having access to are different things... 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:14:04
Nop, those are not bitaccess, they would not release such an hideous product ... Not sure they are bitcoin teller machine at all actually ... This looks like a fake

Just be patient, they are working hard on it ... Also you should test, commit and participate if you are in a hurry !

Thank you for un TL;DR my thoughts. You should make a post out of it... 
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:48:47
Same for same reasons ...
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:25:30
And we avoided the demo effect ! It runs like a charm :-)
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:42:16
1. He could if the computer was online, but in this scenario I assumed only one computer is (the one where the transaction is created)
2. Not in this implementation. It is a cold storage scenario. Half signed transaction can not be broadcasted (afail), they will be rejected by the network, that's why they are transferred on another medium between the participants.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:04:22
Yes this is it.The document exists also in french and italian.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:26:48

Why would you even trade with those guys,  when there are already Swiss services that will respect your Privacy?

You should look into Olimex open source hardware: 
Very powerful and still cheap

Seems to me they are just adding new ways for people to get bitcoins.  The more the merrier! Plus they sell atms worldwide not only in Canada...  And rumors are rumors ��
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:40:38
We are too...

So only the registered and willing to participate users will practice fractionnal reserve all together, as a big familly ... :-) 
Coinbase is not really a transparent structure and not at all following Bitcoin philosophy (holding coins for you, threatening fungibility, no proof of reserve ...). 
People should stay away (But I guess they have a marketting budget big enough to convince the masses otherwise ...).

Something tells me that if todd went to see the CIA, maybe bitcoin would not even exist today :-) This guys is pragmatic, prone to discussion, a good engineer, calm ... In short, a very decent representation of Bitcoin (Not saying he is THE one, but certainly doing a good job at it)

Just check the board members of the biggest institutions and you'll notice that they are constituted of a small ring of the very same persons ... It's no secret to anyone. So yeah, you'll have a bit more root account to control but essentially nothing impossible for them :-)
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:55:39

@_date: 2016-06-13 06:14:48
If he had fun coding, that's very cool to share ... Maybe some people want to improve it. 
For example, I would totally see the server part as a 21 app. Just made one myself yesterday, to have fun and to LEARN.
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:32:27
Yep this feels funny ...
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:37:14
I don't think so it's just need to be improved... You have to put a lot of work to hit high goals. This was a one year + project,  very hyped for sure, but full of lessons! 
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:01:51
same, next pair of italian shoes bought with some btc ? :-)
@_date: 2016-06-09 21:07:42
Hum, could you elaborate ... I don't see much on their website, and as far as I know there is no hardfork ready to enable sidechain yet. Am I wrong ?
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:56:01
A good old rofl on this one... 
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:34:48
Come on! Not even Ethereum come close to the bitcoin ecosystem (wallet, payment provider etc ...). I'm sure all those companies would  love to redevelop all their services so people can do cheap tx ! This really sound like a waste of energy ...
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:14:52
It helps a lot solving equations, unlocking your creative side !
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:26:07
Nop, but you can use them in ways that provide a decent level of security (Trezor / Ledger / ...)
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:00:05
This August? Wow super! 
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:41:01
All those things turn out to be rather boring very quickly... Run a business, travel the world, sail the seas, fall in love : those are worth remembering lifetime adventures (and a better spending of you time and money). My 2 sats here.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:16:40
I'm sure it will come, patience :) Though the python lib is already really cool
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:08:15
I don't think that if the same problem was found in ethereum forking to solve it would be contentious... The Dao is not part of the basement of ethereum,  it's an app build on top!

Hi guys, I would like to have my next project supported as a module in the wallet. But I was wondering if you have a rough estimate of the time it would be available ?
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:53:04
ppl always do the opposite of what we advice them to do :-) You need to adapt !
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:38:26
It's my worry too... After all, it can't be an exchange crash that pop the  bubble this time. Once bitcoin blockchain will be frozen, suddenly a patch will be deployed as fast as Vitalik can code a bailout ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:20:15
Paid to "we the people" of course ;-)

WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS ? STOP TRADING !
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:58:07
I agree, the tx fees are non negligible at all at small amounts.

A rough estimate: what's your marging or error ? Where are you data coming from (I've seen vastly better social systems in Switzerland, for half the taxes than its french neighbor, and in an overall much more "liberal" mindset ...)
Your answer also assume current system is optimal, that money is correctly allocated, that there is no corruption, etc ... What if we could do better for less by being organised differently ?
On a more personnal note: maybe you should go medidate a bit on your notion of trust. I would highly recommend you to go do a Vipassana course for example, to extract all this latent anger from your soul.
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:32:32
He's making you go circles ...
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:34:43
You might be right, wondered if they ever bought something with it... 
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:19:30
Where does this 30 % number comes from? Thanks for your paternalistic answer by the way... 
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:32:03
You should visit France, we have managed to have toll and governement roads at once ! The Pinnacle !
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:39:29
So you don't trust your own ability to put your money where your mouth is and fund the charity of your choices ? Interesting ...
@_date: 2017-04-27 07:05:54
You know they still use bitcoin too, so potentially strong stuffs ...

Because we try to think a little bit "out of the box" here ... Damn isn't  it cats that are supposedly fascinated by boxes and not humans !??
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:19:20

This said, this citation is not from me, I've read it in French on an association website:
