Blah blah blah. Shut up you filthy push-over statist.

Absolutely. The federal government is a textbook example of sociopathy.

Ignore the government and they have no power. They only have power because we acknowledge that they have power. It's time to stop acknowledging those sociopathic idiots and move on with building our new society. We are the change that we have been waiting for and there's nothing stoping us but ourselves.

Reminds me of *[Confessions of an Economic Hitman](
I personally believe the way forward is neotribalism (a la Burning Man / "transformational gathering" / intentional community type culture) rather than large monolithic societies ("nations"). Just like bitcoin, the key to a successful life on this earth lies in distribution rather than centralization.

No, but crying for regulation and adherence to the status quo is.

It cannot be salvaged nor should it. Our current modalities are outdated and our technology has advanced far beyond them. It's time to build a new society right underneath this crumbling piece of crap. It's the circle of life. Anything less is just delaying the inevitable.
