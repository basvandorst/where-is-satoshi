We sell bullion in Illinois and there is no tax on any coin, bullion or paper money.  We charge spot plus our fee and thats it.  Maybe just find a local dealer in Illinois and you will never worry about tax plus your not paying shipping fees either.

I would like to point out that even though the timing of the outage was poor because of everything that has recently happened in the bitcoin world, these are the sort of things that can be expected going forward.  
Even my BMO Harris bank account has issues with their site from time to time and have outages or their system doesn't record a payment.  
The important thing here is that wallets are safe!  All the rest is all just fear based in my opinion.

We are working on an API through coinbase but it is not ready yet.  So for the moment we are having clients just use the wire choice or check choice and then after the order is received we send them an invoice through coinbase to settle out the funds.  It has worked fine so far.

I just spoke to my accountant who is also a house rep in Illinois.  She looked this money act up and it did not pass and actually yet and in fact died.  I am emailing my rep everything on bitcoins so she can let other reps know the truths when it comes up for vote.

Thanks!  Well if you ever make it to Chicago we have lots of pick bins of world coin and paper.  Just does not pay to list them on the web site.

Thanks guys on the love!  Yes I have had to slow my breathing several times before answering!  I think it is still important to post on places like FB because if bitcoins is going to grow we have to educate from the ground up.
I see things continue to change on some levels besides FB as just last week, I was teaching one of our big clients about bitcoins. I was showing him how to make a paper wallet and what cold storage meant.  When guys like this are asking how to get involved, I know bitcoins future is bright!
