With great power comes great responsibility. I like the person he is now better than the one he was but what happened to him was definitely over the top!

Women tend to be more conservative and take less risks (why we live longer). Throw a few more off bridges with a bungy on their legs and bitcoin will seem a walk in the park! No seriously it just needs to be easier to use and safer so it seems less of a risk! I am a food scientist so all I want from bitcoin is to have a wallet that is secure and yet easy to use anywhere in the world on my smart phone. Sounds so simple but I know it is not. So I am watching and cheering the innovators and risk takers who will make it happen! Good to see other women interested though!

I have seen first hand how he operates companies he does understand. 30% of my department fired 6 months after he bought the company. I don't trust his motives for talking down bitcoin.

Looks good. A good outlet for creative expression that is hard to get featured elsewhere.

Looks really good just might want to list "capitilize" as positive as one of the feeds highlighted as red was about Taiwan capitizing on chinese ban. (I am assuming green is good and red is bad". Great site though!

I really really wish my local farmers market could work out how to integrate it as I am sick of waiting 40mins in the ATM queue for normal cash then paying a $2 fee for the privilage! I wish I could go overseas and get local currency without the fees or hassle. I wish I could pay for deliveries when they are delivered on the spot instead of waiting for an invoice forgeting to pay it then getting a cross reminder notice from the poor electrician. The more you think the more uses you spot!

It needs to be seamless and easy to use. Huge opportunity with international travel.

Good idea keeps the control with me I can opt in or out.

Imoney sounds like something controlled by apple. As a women myself bitcoin works fine but what got me interested was learning there were only 21mil of them. They just need more marketing to women in how they csn benefit us and make life easier!

I found myself nodding with your final thoughts. I really really hope there are Robocoin ATMs rushing to airports before I travel later this year! I want this to work as well and I am waiting with excitement to see these issues iron out over time!
