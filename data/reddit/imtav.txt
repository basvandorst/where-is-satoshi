How much BTC do you presently have? That could just be the change left over from your transaction.

Are you in the business of calling tops and bottoms now? If selling at 11850 was a good idea, then how is buying at 11600 also a good idea? Pure gamble

It is pseudonymous because I, as an everyday user, cannot distinguish one wallet address from the next if I’m trying to track who you are. However, once a party gets one piece of the puzzle (an exchange like you mention), then it is possible for this party or someone working with that knowledge (FBI for example) to track down every last satoshi you’ve acquired or spent.
If you want anonymity from the every day user, BTC is fine. If you want anonymity from all parties, then you need to look at different cryptos altogether

With a deflationary asset, most people will find themselves with less as time passes and they cash in some of their coins.  It’s very difficult to not beat yourself up about it. I mean I only had 7.5 BTC and sold that last year, and I’m beating myself up over it. Unfortunately it seemed to have caused your brother too much grief to handle and I’m truly sorry for your loss.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Fiats are inflationary. By their very nature, inflationary currencies encourage spending, and deflationary currencies encourage holding. Bitcoin makes for a very poor choice for everyday purchases because of this.

Technically, I could heat my home slightly from the friction caused by masturbating profusely all winter.

Quadrigacx. That’s who I always use, never had an issue with deposits or withdrawals.

You store your private keys on a hard drive. Wallets exist in the blockchain and are accessed with these private keys.

I use a zero knowledge cloud server with 2FA using google Authenticator on my phone.

If you’re storing on a computer without encrypting then you’re better off using a piece of paper and hiding it. If you’re looking for cheap encryption options then check out some zero knowledge cloud servers like mega.nz and spideroak. Alternatively, you can store them in a cloud based password manager like dashlane or LastPass.
Lastly, if you don’t trust cloud computing then check out password safe on source forge. You can create an encrypted safe with all your keys and then store this on thumb drive or maybe as a draft in your email.
I wouldn’t trust myself to protect all my private keys. A fire or a computer problem could result in the loss of all my keys. That’s why I use cloud back-up for everything.

I use a password manager that allows emergency access. If one of my approved family members requests access to my vault and I don’t deny the request within 7 days, they get access to my vault which has all the private keys, including a tutorial on how to use the wallets. Why save for my son’s future if my unexpected death would freeze those savings?

Darn. I tried

I forget the exact analogy but it’s something like “it would take all the world’s computers a few hundred years working together to brute force your private keys”. The holes in security are due to human error. No-one can get your coins unless you make a mistake (and that mistake may be using the wrong exchange, or storing your coins on an exchange, etc). If you don’t own the private keys for your wallet, you don’t actually own your wallet, the exchange does. Think about that.

I like bitcoin because it’s free from politics. Code is law
