From what I heard you have to have a 5 to 1 position in order to short. 
If you want to short 1 Bitcoin at $15,000 you need to have $75,000 for liquidity reasons. I can only imagine what this would look like if Whales want to really move the market towards $25,000

@_date: 2016-03-09 22:39:10
I will agree that the direct depositing with bitcoin is a clever idea. That whole concept you have going is a great idea, but all I use my coinbase account for is my shift card. 
Whatever I'm not spending goes into the vault of theirs or sent over to Bitfinex to do some trading. 
I will take a look at BitWage and see what they have going on. I only read over the article and site. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:58:48
No idea why everyone hates on Coinbase. I have a Visa from them that I can use to spend my Bitcoin ANYWHERE that accepts Visa's. And their Coinbase Exchange is great too for trading the bitcoin I've bought from them. 
Sure they may seem like a bank, but I don't know of any other wallets that can produce a VISA card to spend my Bitcoin wherever.

That doesn't sound like a good idea at all. 
Let's say your paycheck is $820. And you want half to go to bitcoin. You now successfully have 1 Bitcoin valued at $410. Things seem all fine and dandy. Well what are you going to do when/if there is a dump. Bitcoin drops to $400 or below. Your bitcoin is now worth less of what it's original value was, you're now at a loss. Congrats, you've lost money. 
As an avid trader I'd strongly recommend putting that money into an exchange, like Bitfinex, and buying bitcoin at a set price instead of just direct depositing X amount of dollars into bitcoin when it chicks be at it's highest value.
Just my two cents
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:38:45
This isn't 2011 anymore. Mining isn't profitable. You're going to burn more money mining than you are making it back. Especially with the halving coming up it'll be pointless to mine unless you have dozens of S7 with free power. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:20:29
Nice meta source there. The only way you're going to get a reasonable ROI is when you have free electricity with a dozen S7's. With the halving coming up they'll be worthless unless you have free electricity. If I bought an S7 today and ran it, it would take me 5 months to ROI on it when electricity costs are included. 
Right now I'm running 6 S5's. I have been mining them for about a year now, so I've defiantly ROI'ed them, but with difficulty increases I got smaller and smaller rewards every two weeks. Thankfully these past few weeks the difficulty has lighten up. So, I might start seeing my old "high" reward days. 
Regardless, I'm selling half of them off and putting the other 3 to peercoin mining. Why? Because even right now I'm not making much profit at all. At this point in the game my mining is paying my electricity bills and then some. Whatever I have left over at the end of the month I put towards buying a tank or two of gas.
I wish I had sold my miners months ago and bought S7's, but with the halving just months away it will be pointless to have any miners still up and running unless I had a farm. Majority of miners are already mining at a loss, but once the halving hits everyone week just continue to dig that loss home even further than before. Therefore trading more miners offline and making it easier for farms to continue mining.
Which leads to companies like Spondoolies and Bitfury making commercial miners for hobbyists and potentially making the blockchain more decentralized.
So, no, mining is not profitable unless you have a farm.

I don't know what your background knowledge is on bitcoin trading, but it doesn't just fluctuate up and down on its own. The price of bitcoin drops in value when there is bad news over when there is good news. And most of the time the past few dumps were from bad news relating to how Core doesn't want to allow a 2MB hardfork, how they are going to deny certain access. The BIP's that they have revoked. etc, and with that being the case. Core cannot keep being supported if all it's going to do is make the value of bitcoin drop. 
Other times chinamen like to hold coins and try to dump their coin and force a drop in price too. A lot of people will liquidate their assets and if you watch certain markets you will see a dip in price because of how much coin is sold at a certain price. 
One day on the Coinbase Exchange the price was at around $400, and someone sold around 2000 bitcoins and the price dipped to a staggering $390 for about 3 minutes. hit up they will back that info up. 
Miners are really the only ones that can truly vote on who they want dev'ing the blockchain, and more often than not people are voting classic because of the 2MB block limit choice. These past few weeks there have been tons and tons of full blocks. Some that even become gridlocked in certain pools they are just over capacity. And then to add insult to injury core just came out and said that a 2MB HF will never be implemented into the Blockchain under their supervision. So much for freedom of choice. 
As of right now there is nobody to "choose" as the developer because core and Blockstream basically run everything, and every time that Classic releases a new HF idea, BIP, you name it. People shoot it down and this sub censors it into oblivion. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:00:35
Yes, and so is Blockstream
@_date: 2016-03-26 20:20:05
First off. Blockstream has 9 core devs. So there is the first problem with Blockstream. With that much influence on the company they will be pro-core to the bone. Core in general is going to drive Bitcoin into the ground and make the network more centralized. 
Decentralized development is, in a way, more important than trying to push for a 2MB block limit (which is really important to miners). Blockstream is only voting for Core related developed. Decentralization = choice. Blockstream are making it to be where you have fewer choices.

Coinbase did it first
@_date: 2016-03-10 02:56:01
The reason I say that is because you're better off setting a limit to buy X amount of bitcoin at a certain price. Than having an out deposit

I'm not worried about this dump. China is nefarious for these kinds of things. You don't lose your money until you sell and Bitcoin will always go back up

I have stocks in AMD, NVDA, and Duke Energy. Bought a few Nvidia stocks back when they were little $30 stocks. Shorted my shipping stocks right before trump was elected, threw it into Bitcoin and turned a nice profit. Bought a boatload of Silver when they dipped before the FED rate hike.

90% off my income and savings have been turned to Bitcoin. It seems like Bitcoin investors are more risk tolerant which is why I have seen a few people go full Bitcoin with their currency.

I set aside money each week for weekly purchases. I spent a lot of time on learned a few tricks on trading bitcoin. Tried trading with Bitcoin and got hooked on the premise of trading. An addicting way to make and lose money if you don't play your cards right. 
Every time there is a big dip or retrace in time. BUY. THE. FUCKING. DIP. You will not regret it. I spend large portions of my income mostly on dips. If the price was able to reach an X month ATH then it'll do it again. Buy the dip from the retrace and hodl. Usually I put 5%-10% of my income into weekly buys. I save most of my fiat for when the price goes down a bit. 
Basically, if you spend enough time reading Bitcoin related news, Studying the forex market, reading the charts, talking with like minded people, you could possibly walk away with more money than you began with if you know what you're doing. 
**tl;dr do you homework, study the markets, read the news, learn to hodl your Bitcoin, always Buy The Fucking Dip!**

Which is good for miners like myself. Once the Halving begins miners will require more profit per bitcoin in order to continue making a profit/supporting the network. Not going to be surprised if we hit $500 by July

If they are going to start optimizing themselves and want to expect people to buy them to support the network they really need to come down in price. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:35:35
There would be no reason for it to sore that high other than bullish reasons and people selling their coins, leaving traders to short their bitcoin and profit almost immediately. Or wait for a bearish pump from a controversy and long their investment from a low buy and selling high. 
Either way. Bitcoin will never surpass that value in the coming years. It would take lots of effort and buying to get the value that high

Been with Coinbase close a while now. Even have a shift card. This review hits all the right pros and cons. 
One thing I would add is that the debit card limit of $40 a day and high fee for instant bitcoin is a bit ridiculous. I feel like after buying so much Bitcoin at the $40 limit you should get some sort of limit raise. Just like buying with a credit card. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:28:38

@_date: 2016-07-17 16:22:28
I have an excellent credit rating, but I don't that's the case though. Now, is your instant but limit with a credit or debit card?
