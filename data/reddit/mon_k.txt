The coming decade is set to have much more upheaval than the past one. 
You could end up like the modern day Nostradamus and predict all the world catastrophies before they happen.

Depending on their level of wealth, they might actually be spending more on the time that they use to worry about coupons than they would save from the coupons. 
Time is the most valuable resource we have, and when you're trading that time to actively manage a coupon book, you're essentially giving yourself a micro-job. 
TINSTAAFL and all that...
The coupons savings become your salary for the time you take to manage the coupons, and I guarantee they're going to save less from those than they'd make if they spent that time otherwise worrying about investments/opportunities.

I'm honestly a newb when it comes to the mechanics, but isn't the real goal to get people to "adopt Bitcoin" instead of "buy Bitcoin"? 
I know that seems like semantics in this stage because the main way to get Bitcoin into your life at this stage is essentially trading for money that fluctuates daily with money that doesn't for the most part. And for most people that doesn't make any sense, unless they rationalize it as an investment- that it might go up in the future to cash out for more.
Bitcoin is perceived as a good because people are told to go out and buy it. Like a TV or a couch. 'Go out and own a Bitcoin today!' Because of that people ask themselves "what benefit do I get from **having** it". 
The message needs to be adopt Bitcoin as a way to go about how you already live your life, or "Use Bitcoin".
Like the transition from writing on paper to writing on a typewriter- you're still writing, the typewriter just provides you with benefits as you do it. In the future we'll still be buying and selling, Bitcoin will just provide benefits as we do it.
Unfortunately when Bitcoin hit the mainstream it showed everyone the benefits of owning it instead of using it. Now there needs to be a reeducation on the topic and it's harder to change first impressions.
My opinion is the only way to have Bitcoin adopted as a system mainstream is to get more and more people choosing to be paid in Bitcoin. Once you don't have to think about "buying" it then you can move on to thinking about how you can "use" it.
