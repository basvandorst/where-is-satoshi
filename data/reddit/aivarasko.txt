how you would start such agency? just interested in steps-process thinking
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:05:54
Any other Bitcoin travelers here? Would be cool to hear more stories of Bitcoin flights/ferries/trains/hitchhiking? Any personal experiences? :)
@_date: 2014-12-29 06:56:40
 - Flights for Bitcoin only. Best deals in Europe, great worldwide.
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:54:24
this is huge. 1 more big player and general public can f*off. yes/no?
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:48:53
some cool channels you've got!
idea: why not ask for your top users to make a short video or 10sec mention inside regular video about bitcoin in general and how everyone benefits from this
(advice: when asking, prepare text for them - make it easy for them to promote bitcoin)
too pushy. might be. but with good intentions, everything is possible:)

definetly. more:  they even have btc dedicated flight ticketing site: 
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:08:58
you can find contact form on their homepage:  . There might be problems with your order/payment/documents/etc, therefore you have not received your tickets yet.

what if...you give away NOT for Nothing, but for Something. and that Something being the increasing speed of bitcoin adoption?
More people value bitcoin, more value left for you of bitcoins you keep, no?
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:54:10
just trying out: upvote @_date: 2015-01-29 15:53:15
should be more... VCs are throwing millions just to believe that such number will 100x in near future? I must assume there is &gt;1 mill active users right now
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:49:06


does that make users feel "safer" to control more than one? to constantly change the address?
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:51:43
c'mon I can't believe that :))
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:17:45
flyhi operates in major European markets under different names. But since this year we have dedicated flight ticketing service for Bitcoins only - [abitsky.com]( try it out, tell us what you think
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:12:53
So how fast are we growing?
Guy [here]( calculated 1.2 million addresses that have "meaningful value of bitcoin" (back in February, 2014)
Any analytical guess for today?

Just don't forget to be persistent! It takes time to achieve the goal :)
Skipping banks alone ads lots of benefits: speed, no-fraud, no credit card data storage. Also its growth in mainstream - more and more people/business accept it. The association would be more tech-savvy and would provide better services for its members.
What I would add from my perspective, that its getting easier and easier to travel on btc, besides expedia/cheapair/btctrip operating in America's; Flysiesta.co.uk has dedicated site - abitsky.com for best flight deals in Europe for Bitcoins only.

you could also check  - same flyhi.fi, just dedicated to Bitcoins only.
