As somebody who transferred coins off GDAX into my Coinbase before transferring it in my offline wallet yesterday, I feel stupid. I paid like $4 in fees. At least now I know. Thanks!

I think you can afford lunch if you have 16 million dollars :o

Explain to me how this would work? Wouldn't everyone get the code, and whoever spent it first got the prize?

I just tried searching Coinbase on Yahoo, first result seems to be the real deal

He had an outgoing payment going to 16m8AsVRSUMNUeis96qqLjRrkB8JMHrPyQ, I'm just assuming it's his own account. Maybe not.

I gyfted myself a $1500 Amazon gift card at $577 last tuesday. Damnit. Should have waited 5 more days!

If it were guaranteed, why the hell would anyone be selling now? Because it's not guaranteed like you guys think

I always assumed this too, but isn't most bitcoin trading happening in China? Why would they care about the USD benchmarks?

Ok, can someone give me advice? 
I ordered a Trezor and it's arriving tomorrow, the day before the BGold split (I ordered it specifically with that in mind). I was planning to transfer all my virtual currency from Coinbase onto the device.
However, given that it seems like BGold isn't going to be worth anything, and I'll be able to get my S2X coins directly from CB after the split, is there any reason (besides security) why I should put my coins on my Trezor device now? 
My end goal is to sell the S2X coins for more BTC. It seems a lot easier for me to just leave all my coins in my CB account and sell my S2X when it is deposited into my account. Unless I'm missing something. 
Just seems pointless to be transferring my coins off Coinbase only to transfer them back to the exchange to sell the S2X coins

Why would you hope it went through if you purchased before the crash?

You should, like, cash out and retire
