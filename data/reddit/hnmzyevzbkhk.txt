So with this setup you may compromise any/all of (in order of severity):
1. Your privacy (your balance) if your TeamViewer is compromised.
2. Your offline stash if through TeamViewer, a hacker plants malware that will transfer itself on the USB you use to move signed transactions from the offline PC. or:
3. Plant a MITM type attack between bitcoind and your router.
At least shut the TeamViewer service as I described elsewhere on this thread so it's not running unless you open the interface, and I wouldn't use it for remote access to your Armory online PC ever.

It's in the works, and I agree that a light version would be great. However, what I really REALLY hate to read on r/bitcoin are sob stories about hacked online wallets, hacked exchanges, hacked phone wallets.
Armory goes a long way on that front, and I'm running the on-line computer with a measly 2GB windows box. The offline is ancient technology. 
Give it a spin - even if you won't use it, learning about operational security would benefit you directly.

Also check the latest LetsTalkBitcoin with Adam Back: bitcoins on a side chain don't exist simultanously on the block-chain. 
This is *somewhat* similar to an alt-coin that is merge-mined with bitcoin, like name-coin. So you would 'sell' your bitcoin for, say 100 'side-coins' that'll let you do innovations that bitcoin currently can't, like smart contracts etc. 
The important issue: if the side chain collapses - your bitcoins that were committed to it are also gone. 
The difference between a merged-mined alt-coin and a side-chain is that with a side-chain there's a *two-way peg* which means whereever the block-chain goes - so does the side-chain - it's strongly attached to it.

1. Create a blockchain.info wallet
2. Make a paper backup.
3. Laminate the paper backup.
4. Hide the laminated paper backup.
5. Pray that no one finds it.
Not as safe, but OK if your BTC worth is less than 1% of your net worth.

reposting reply:
It doesn't really compare. The whole concept is different.
Armory was built from the grounds up with operational security in mind.
Among other things, it's manifested in:
* torrent downloads of new version from secured seed boxes that the local copy can verify via signed packages.
    
* built-in fragmented backup feature.
* HD wallet (new address generated for every receiving transaction) - not sure, but I don't think electrum has that.
  
*  uses the full security of bitcoin-qt to connect to the blockchain, 
* Doesn't rely on 3rd party servers.
The cost is you need to run a full node and keep a local copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:08:58
Use itbit.
cost: ~25$ wire transfer+0.2% transaction fee = $45 to $125 compared to $100 to $500 at coinbase.

I bought a few usb miners last October, for about $15 each (block erupters - 130nm ASICs, obsolete now) from ebay. I learned a lot about mining at first, and then got into the overclocking scene and wrote above linked tutorial. 
Overall - best way to learn is have skin in the game, its a blast.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:48:12
Armory isn't competing with perfect. A lite version would be great and is in the plans. 
However, the top priority right now is getting Armory stability and speed up to snuff while adding more security features (the latest being fragmented backups, secured verified downloads and security announcements).
@_date: 2014-03-22 07:49:16
Armory cons:
* Requires ~38GB disk space to hold the blockchain.
* Optimal implementation requires a separate offline PC (any ancient PC/laptop will do) 
* Beta grade code - needs patience with initial setup and learning curve.
Armory pros:
* The security is on another level. Fragmented backups verified torrent based updates and real time alerts to scams are  just the latest features. It's really far far ahead of anything else.
* Very actively developed. latest version (0.9.99-4 beta) really put out so many new features and the level of support on bitcointalk.org is just phenomenal.
* The interface really is a hand-holding walkthrough in operational security - and if you just take the time to follow it, you'll end up with a setup that is the best mix today between ease of use and operational security of your BTC. Worth doing just for the learning experience.
tl;dr - For people with more than a few mBTC and some patience to work with Beta grade software - Armory is the clear choice.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:30:06
The small amount stolen indicates that your online computer is compromised either through the network connection or via a trojan or a keyboard logger. That means:
* Any password that's on the online computer may be compromised (may include passwords needed to boot, login and open the offline computer)
* There might be malware on the USB used for signing, because it has touched the online computer.
* The compromised computer might have revealed the balance (Armory online half reveals that).
Needless to say, at the very least that requires password changes, USB format, and virus/malware checks.
Look up canary wallet. It's an integral component of operational security.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:21:03
Not only good - great. Allow me to explain:
Had he used Armory, he would have been able to recreate his wallet from paper backup (or fragmented backup) no matter what happened to it. Furthermore, the chances of anything happening to his offline wallet would have been greatly reduced if he would have kept it on a PC that is dedicated to it.
As for stability, since 0.9.99x Armory is light years ahead from where it used to be. Maybe you should give it a spin too.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:10:54
There are parts of bitcoin-qt that you would not want to touch (bitcoind), and they are large and resource intensive. Besides a ~17GB disk space for the blockchain, the Wifi will be humming continously and syncing to the btc network - that's also resource intensive (about 600MB during sync, and about 100MB afterwards).
So at a minimum you're looking at netbook level hardware, with say 64GB HD/SSD and 1-2GB main memory and a continuously on network connectivity. Easy. Won't last long on battery though.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:06:23
I think you may have misunderstood me. By 'compromised' I meant stolen.
The offline computer cannot have any malware on it - the setup for the extra-paranoid is along these lines:
* pick a random 'best buy' and get a freshly minted new netbook and USB stick. Format both. USB needs to be as small as possible - 128MB is good. The smaller the USB the harder to place malware on it. Use that USB exclusively for transactions between online and offline
* Hardware disable all radios and transmitters: BT,Wifi, audio  and of course ethernet port.
 
* Freshly formatted HD and verified linux binaries freshly installed from a USB or external CD/DVD, not over network.
* install verified Armory via the fresh USB and nothing else.
* create wallet, fragmented paper backup on a USB non-networked printer. 
* Laminate the fragments and distribute across geographic locations.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:59:03
I see what you're saying, but I argue it's not the same, and not enough because if the computer you describe ever was on the internet, then even though you reboot in step 1 disconnected from the internet, some internet injected malware may already be there, across boots, across fresh OS installations.
Theoretically it can hide in the printer memory or BIOS (and live across boots). Where exactly and how is not really relevant, but every year defcon presenters show new and innovative vulnerabilities.
Point is, there is no such thing as a **totally** immune internet connected PC.
 With bitcoin, for the first time, **almost** doesn't cut it anymore. My prediction is that as bitcoin grows in value, so will the attacks on personal wallets stored on devices that at one point were exposed to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:25:52
With respect to the 'big boys' (whether WS whales or government regulators) - they can only manipulate by:
* stopping transactions at the fiat-btc interface, though this is limited to specific geographical sovereignty
* attempt at manipulating btc price via wag-the-dog futures, options, ETFs etc, similar to what Gox did in the days before its demise. That too is limited to an exchange.
Every sovereign nation/criminal organization/religion/feudal lord throughout history relies on one or more of four monopolies: over **knowledge**, over **violence**, over **land** and/or over **currency**. The bitcoin protocol, running on top of the internet protocol is an effective technological assault on some of these monopolies, bringing at least some of that power back to the people. That's a biggie that's almost unprecedented, rivaled perhaps only by the printed book.
As for alt-coin hedging - Last I checked they all rise and fall in step with BTC. The only alt-coin worth checking is gold/silver coins stored safely nearby, IMO.
  
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:53:29
A side-chain is a super-set of altcoin: anything an altcoin does a side-chain can potentially do. 
However, to create a side chain, the *bitcoin* miners need to be incentivized to mine it - a non-trivial task.
Also - there's no code for side-chain technology yet (not even a white paper) and surely it'll take some time to code and find out if it's a viable option, not to mention debugging and hardening it against attacks.

I took that advice from an opsec forum. That USB stick used for transaction signing is the weakest point in the OP setup, because it's the bridge across the airgap between the online and offline halves.
If said bridge is compromised, the entire setup's security  is gone. Here's a possible  scenario on a high value bitcoin user:
1. compromised online computer reveals Armory online, and balance of BTC.
2. Targeted malware (specifically designed for Armory USB) catches the ride on the USB to the offline. 
3. Once inserted on the offline, delivers the payload (worst case gets the wallet somehow)
4. back online transmit to command center.
There have been thoughts of other, more secure ways to sign transactions, an interesting one being using an audio cable - but nothing concrete AFAIK

@_date: 2014-04-21 04:21:12
No it's not. My experience shows that with OP setup it takes less than a minute to:
1. create an unsigned transaction on a USB.
2. wake the offline from hibernate, enter truecrypt password
3. sign transaction in offline Armory.
4. broadcast transaction in online Armory.
Seriously, Armory is the best combo of security and ease of use. Nothing else really compares. It's in a league of its own.

Unfortunately, there's no white paper yet and not even a web page, so this is mostly from mental notes I got from the Let's Talk Bitcoin show:
* The two-way peg system as I understand it links between the two chains similar to the way merge-mining works: pools will need an  incentive to mine the side-chain. It was suggested that if you trade say 1 BTC for 100 SDC you'll get say only 95 SDC and the remaining five will go to the side-chain miners and with the 95 you'll be able to, say, purchase smart contracts. You're 1 BTC is gone (off the block-chain) and reappears on the side-chain in the form of 100 SDC, and vice versa. Does that make more sense?
* The two-way peg also follows the block chain temporally, so for example if the block chain generates a block every 10 minutes, the side chain that, say, represents high frequency trading, will generate 10000 blocks in that same period=1000 blocks per minute, synced to the block chain in time. If hashing power goes up on the block-chain as it has been doing the past 2+ years, the side-chain needs to keep up.
* If the side-chain is under, say, a 51% attack, or turns out to be a ponzi or dies because of myriad of reasons alt-coins die - the side-chain is gone together with whatever BTC were invested in it. That won't affect the bitcoin block-chain though. It will continue to chug along.
All-in-all, it's an innovative way to latch onto the network effect of bitcoin, without being bogged down by the conservatism of the core-dev team implementations of protocol change (that conservatism is there for a very good reason, don't get me wrong here).
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:23:45

Markets, especially nascent ones such as bitcoin, have nothing, absolutely nothing to do with reason nor logic and everything to do with behavioral psychology, network effects and chaos theory. Thusly they are unpredictable and assuming a past short term trend will repeat itself is superficial analysis.
Bitcoin price has always been/is/will be derived from it's value, which in turn is derived from it's usefulness and resulting adoption rate. That's as far as you can go prediction-wise.

bitcoin-qt is needed and used for the entire interaction between Armory and the blockchain. This way Armory 'outsources' all the security of the reference client regarding interactions with the blockchain.
Bitcoin-qt doesn't make your computer a miner. It'll take a lot of resources initializing but after its up and synced, it reduces its memory footprint to about 100MB, and disk usage to about 17GB
If you don't need the wallet features of bitcoin-qt (Armory doesn't), you can disable that part of the wallet by adding the line:


to bitcoin.conf file.

Reason for this post, to quote:
"...Individuals wishing to propose existential changes to the network should have that discussion in the public sphere, where the users are, so that those users have the best information possible regarding which implementations they should trust.
Core developers are not philosopher-kings who rule the network by imposing their judgement on the hoi polli, and they shouldn't act like it. (Note that this is not the first time Mike Hearn has floated proposals he knew Bitcoin users wouldn't like as trial balloons in relative obscurity). Once there is consensus among the community, or at least after they are aware of the proposal, then the development mailing list is an appropriate place to discuss how to implement it..."

Not only bicoin *can* become a modern world currency - **it has**. Proof: I can and have used it to transfer funds around the world, so it obviously has.
1. As for scalability - I agree that right now the blockchain can't handle Visa/MC level of transactions per second (15000/sec during Christmas shopping) - BUT that's a purely technical issue that I can guarantee you will be solved. Follow the bitcoin-dev mailing list - the issue is discussed there by the core-dev people from time to time. Also see the new idea of side-chains, Peter Todd's tree of chains. The only reason this isn't implemented is that right now there's no need to, and if it ain't broken, don't fix it - is the mentality of the core-dev.
2. As for dynamic - if you mean inflationary/centrally manipulated money supply - I for one think it's not only a bad idea, it's the source of all fiat currency collapses since recorded history.

Well, how would you spend from that offline computer? How would you send BTC to the network if that offline computer doesn't have access to it. What Armory does is have the convenience of an online wallet (that generates addresses for receiving funds, track your balance, sends **signed by the offline computer** transactions) - all the while its other half is across an air gap - something no malware can jump across.


Not sure what MBA stands for, but anyway, here are a few suggestions:
* Take the version pointed by my original post - it's a testing version but in my opinion, the most stable so far, just shy of a wide release.
* Take the latest bitcoin-qt. It will take 6-8 hours to sync and the latest Armory will take another 2-3 hours. Just let it do it's thing overnight or when you don't need to use the PC. It's slow, I know, and it'll take about 40GB of disk space. However, once it's done - it won't take much memory, about the same that skype takes (+ same for bitcoin-qt).
* Take your time learning Armory. Create a wallet, make a paper back, then destroy the wallet and delete Armory and see that you can recreate your wallet from just the paper backup. 
* Go slow and be methodical. It's harder than online-wallets for sure, but you'll be rewarded with learning operational-security that will benefit you even if you don't end up using Armory.


It'll take time to get it up and synced initially. Just be patient with it and just let it do it's thing. Read up on the Armory site everything related to setting up and using it. Experiment a lot like I described earlier. Build trust through familiarity and testing. Rattle Armory until you feel comfortable with it.
Make sure you have the latest version I pointed to - if you do find a serious issue - post it to the bounty page I pointed to - the developers are actively seeking people with real issues and the level of support there is phenomenal.

?? No! The offline wallet NEVER touches the internet - EVER. 
The full node is the 'watching only' online part of the wallet that uses bitcoin reference client to interact with the blockchain.
The way this works is the 'online' wallet follows your balance, receives btc, but to release funds - it needs to have the 'offline' wallet sign it. Maintaining that air-gap between the offline and online halves of your wallet is the key to Armory's security.
Even if you never intend to try it - take the time to read about it [here]( - the lessons you'll learn about operational security will benefit you nonetheless.

This may be exasperated by hashing power growth significantly flattening past week. See (the green graph here)[ 
As a result, block generation is once per about 10 minutes, compared to about 8 minutes the past few months of accelerated hashing power.
Maybe the rising difficulty combined with fixed electricity costs and aging miners and BTC recent price flash crash courtesy of MTGox are finally creating a slowdown in mining power=longer intervals between blocks.

@_date: 2014-04-06 18:56:58
I'm not sure I understand your question, but here's what I think you might be missing:
bitcoin addresses are created in pairs: the **private** key(address) starts with '5' and from that private key, the **public** key is derived - and it starts with '1'. Armory isn't different from any other wallet in that respect
As long as you keep your private key private - no one can guess it from the public key, because the algorithm that generated it is one-way function: from private to public.
Every wallet generates these keys (private-&gt;public). So a wallet is more like a key-chain than a real wallet. It doesn't keep your money - it just keeps all the private keys. It's the block-chain that keeps a record of how many bitcoins are in each address (public key) and the entire transaction records.
What makes Armory different is that it keeps your private keys on an offline computer that never touches the internet and uses an 'online' or 'watching-only' half of the wallet that interacts with the block-chain, keep your balance, generates transactions etc. That way you have the convenience of receiving, checking balance with your online wallet, but to **spend** money, you sign that transaction with a computer that never touches the internet, so no malware can reach it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:45:35
I'd seriously recommend you check out [Armory wallet]( - and do all the steps outlined [here]( For extra security:
* The offline wallet HD should run truecrypt.
* Use fragmented backups (Armory generates them automatically). Laminate the paper or otherwise make sure it won't degrade. Give plenty of thought where to place the fragmented backups and who you can trust with a fragment.
* When downloading Armory, use the secure/verified download and go through the verification process.
* Use a simple, directly connected printer (not networked/Wifi).
* Use a newly bought USB stick from a random store, for carrying offline transactions, and get the smallest capacity. 128MB is great. Small==can't carry a heavy payload of malware.
@_date: 2014-04-21 09:00:04
1. It's not cold storage - it's lukewarm storage, mainly because you're not maintaining the air-gap throughout the use process: the connected PC/potentially infected, shares hardware/memory with the unencrypted truecrypt volume along the usage process.
It's reasonable for a setup that doesn't hold much - but would you risk, say, your life's saving on this because you can't get a cheap computer? Seriously?

Thanks for that feedback. Maybe I didn't make myself clear:
1. Although mining pools are made of thousands of miners, these miners don't control the pool, as long as they're in there. Thus Eligius pool participated in destroying an alt-coin that Luke-Jr, the pool operator at that time, decided was a scam coin. (Can't remember the details, but it did happen in 2012 I think). Another example was March 2013 when a hard fork had to be made due to a bug and all it took was a few phone calls to the pool operators and it was done (this was actually a good thing about the fact that there were few). Does that make more sense?
2. The implementation of core-dev decisions by miners is almost automatic, and constitutes of downloading the latest reference client - not doing so is a risk of being cut off from the block-chain in the future. Furthermore, if you read the core-dev mailing list o a regular basis (highly recommended) - there aren't any miners there.  Does that make more sense?
3. Network effect coercion is a very close relative to centralization because it does take away the freedom to innovate. See G. Maxwell's comments recently on the core-dev mailing list regarding side-chains. I fully agree with it. If you think about it some more, network effect looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck - might as well call it a duck. 
4. There are about 33000 acounts that have more than 50 bitcoins that haven't moved in 3+ years. Graphs are out there, but the point is the distribution of bitcoins among addresses is far from 'decentralized' - it has a very long tail. 
5. Not related to mining pools, there are only a few HW mining companies: definition: less than a dozen. Let's see: BFL, KNCMiner, ASICMiners, the couple of Chinese knockoffs. That about covers them all. You can't mine with CPUs and GPUs any longer, right? Does that make more sense?
6. Let's see: coinbase, Kraken, bitstamp, campbx, itbit, vault of satoshi, btc-e, houbi  - I'd say these few handle the vast majority of fiat &lt;--&gt; BTC.

Well put. Thanks.
So, in other words, what happened when you "don't officially own my savings account at my bank" is that you've swapped your money/btc etc for a **promise** (insured or otherwise is irrelevant, it's a promise) to have those funds given back to you when asked for. You now own a promise.
That promise can be kept or broken (see how the Fed is doing keeping its promise to return Germany's gold).
I think what is really different in that respect with Bitcoin is that the blockchain is a promise that is very, very likely to be kept. 
On the other hand, it requires a behavioral change from its owner and you are **absolutely right** that its a crash course through the last hundreds of years on how to handle money. The privileged banked simply forgot how to do operational safety.
 
The other advantage of bitcoin is that operational safety is a lot easier than with cash or gold.

Licking its wounds? This is **Bitcoin's Finest Hour**. Allow me a view from far above:
* Bitcoin's genesis block had a message in it by Satoshi: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” - which was written at the height of the 'Too Big To Fail' bank bailouts, at the expense of the entire global economic system.
* Fast forward five years: MTGox, Bitcoin's 'too big to fail' centralized institute **does fail** and stays failed (weed out the weak from the eco-system).
* In the process, hundreds of thousands of people learn the value of keeping their private keys *private* or affirm what they already knew (instill anti-fragile behavior). 
* Bitcoin's price rebounds (displays anti-fragile behavior).
* Bitcoin's eco-system becomes more robust as alternative exchanges, some decentralized are shaping up. (displaying true anti-fragility).
Compare and contrast with the centralized systems and you'll realize that this is **Bitcoin's finest hour**.

I'd like to urge you to **take the time and do it right**.
 You did right taking ownership of your BTC rather then trusting a company that was never fully audited and uses a vulnerable database. That behavioral change is probably the most important step in bitcoin ownership and I think you did yourself a huge favor if you have more than a few mBTC to your name.
There are a couple of serious shortcuts to get you synced fast:
1. bitcoin-qt has a torrent that downloads the majority of the blockchain a LOT faster than block-by-block. Details [here](
2. Once you got bitcoin-qt up and synced, let Armory do it's thing overnight or when you don't need the online computer. It's mostly a one-time effort. Get the latest testing version of Armory - it's just shy of a wide release and in my opinion very very stable. It's a lot faster than previous versions too. Details [here](
Latest version now is 0.90.99.7
 
3. Once you get Armory up and synced, import the address to the offline wallet (under wallet-properties) and/or send everything to an address generated by your online pc wallet.
Be patient and methodical. What you're doing is probably the most important thing you can do to keep your funds yours. Better do it slow and right and not get off track now that you're in the right direction. 
Fire back with any question.

Bruce, - it's harder than an online wallet, probably always will be. For a guy like you, I am **absolutely positive** that it's no farther than a couple of hours reading/watching youtube tutorial, and a day away from a fully secured setup.
* It starts with the realization that there is no risk-free way to manage your bitcoin on an internet connected computer. 
* Next, spend 30 minutes reading [this page](
* Next, do the step by step described there on your computer: create a wallet, print a paper backup (or even better fragmented backups), then **destroy** the wallet and delete your Armory installation and see that you can recreate your wallet from paper. 
* Send a millibitcoin to your new wallet and see what's involved in doing that.
* Send some back - see what's involved in getting a transaction signed by the offline computer.
* Destroy your wallet again and recreate it, and see that the balance is there.
* By now things should start to clear up and you'd start to appreciate the 'air-gap' that's the basis of the entire system. You'll also feel the 'burden' of running a full node and keeping the entire blockchain and Armory with their 40GB disk space and the time it takes for the system to sync up.
Most important, in my opinion, is the behavioral change you'll go through towards keeping your money safe. This change is so very much needed by 'average bitcoin people' after decades of sedation by the financial sector. You, as an economist probably appreciates this aspect more than most.

Not that simple. Mining hardware becomes obsolete (=unprofitable) by a combination of parameters:  BTC/USD, USD/kWh electricity, cost of new hardware (alternatives) and cost of setup/maintenance (fixed cost).
That aside, overclocking is a viable approach to increase hash efficiency under certain circumstances. For example, if someone already has a soldering station, replacing an oscillator can easily get a 30% increase in hashing power for less than 1$, and 2 minutes of work. It can make a lot of economic sense.

I'll describe the wallets from least secure (easiest to use) to most secure (tend to be harder to use)
1. Easiest, least secure: on-line wallets, can be divided to online wallets that keep your private keys (least secure) to those that have you keep your private keys:
  1.1 Exchange wallets/coinbase wallet etc. all keep your private keys. If they are down, you have no access to your BTC. If they are hacked - you can kiss you BTC goodbye.
  1.2 Online wallets that have you keep your private key: only one I'm aware off, is **blockchain.info** wallet. If it's site is down (happened a couple of weeks ago), you still owe your BTC, but need to find a solution to spend them by importing the private keys to another wallet. Ugly, inconvenient but at least your BTC are still yours.
2. Offline wallets can be subdivided to wallets that trust a third party and those that don't:
  2.1 Trust a third party: need an external server to maintain balance, transactions etc. If that server is down - you still have the private keys (still own your BTC) but need to go through the ugly solution described above. **electrum** and **multibit** and **phone wallets**  fall in this category. electrum is also able to do offline-online computer through some serious gymnastics. 
 2.2 Do not trust a third party -only **bitcoin-qt** maintains EVERYTHING you need locally to receive, create transactions from your local desktop. The price is the weight of the blockchain - 20GB disk space and keeping the wallet synced. 
A major disadvantage: if your PC is hacked and your wallet isn't encrypted or poorly encrypted - you can kiss your BTC goodbye.
**paper wallets** keep your BTC off the internet, though spending from that wallet is inconvenient (you'll need a digital wallet to import the key to, and create a new paper wallet to store the remaining change).
3. Armory -  based on an 'offline' wallet that **never** touches the internet (so avoiding all issues in 2.2) yet is really easy graphically with an online-computer keeping your balance, generating receiving addresses etc. The cost is another 20GB disk space and keeping the full blockchain locally and synced.
If you have more BTC than you mind losing, Armory is the best balance between ease of use and security, IMHO.

How is that different from cash being stolen? 


I'm not suggesting Bitcoin can underly *the entire planet's financial infrastructure* - it's still experimental. I am suggesting that the new data structure, called the block-chain and the underlying protocol are an invention that has disruptive potential to the financial system. In it's current form, bitcoin doesn't scale well, the transactions are too slow among other limitations. Similar limitations where cited for the internet wrt/ older communication protocols - fast forward a few decades and see what I mean?


Bitcoin is large enough for goverments to block it if they could. They did it for much smaller entities such as e-gold, liberty coin etc. Similar to bittorent, the only reason Bitcoin wasn't shut down yet is because it's impossible for any entity to do so at this point.


True - so what? no one can attack the invention of the block-chain or the public ledger or the public key cryptography. Sure, even is SHA-256 is broken, a fix can be applied, just like heartbleed - the internet still exists despite its flaws. Maybe I'm missing what your point is here.

I think that's how humans used to operate across time and geographies, until them there bankers and credit card companies sedated entire populations into trusting the banks/CC instead of themselves.

I truly, honestly believe the bitcoin protocol is anti-fragile and each and every such event makes the bitcoin eco-system more robust, just like the internet and your body when exercised. 
The last time the internet could have been taken away was maybe somewhere in the 70s when most thought it was a military and later an academic side project. 
Thing is, you cannot un-invent an idea. Once it's out, it takes hold.
MTGOX was a central point of failure, similar to Napster. Fast forward, Napster is gone and replaced by anti-fragile P2P bittorrent. 
I suspect EVERY other centralized points of failures will be stomped on as soon as they grow big enough (I'm looking at you, coinbase, Kraken Bitcoin Foundation).
The protocol, however, could never be uninvented.

* see that you can run the latest bitcoin-qt, standalone. Have it synced to the blockchain. That's probably where the issue is. 
* If above is not working, check bitcoin-qt .conf file. It's on your /user/username/appdata/roaming/bitcoin directory, and it should have the following lines in it:
* when you've got bitcoin-qt up and running and synced, run armory and see what happens. You can also switch the disablewallet line above to =1. Armory should now write it's internal database and update your wallet.
* If this doesn't solve the problem, open an issue on the [Armory thread on bitcointalk.org]( the devs and many expert users are there and will promptly address your issue. armory is very actively developed and you'll get your issues solved.

this is the first time in computing history where an average person can own a digital file with cash in it. Own the file==own the cash.
The reason for an offline computer is because keeping that file on an online computer (let alone trading it for a promise on an exchange) is the fastest way known to humans to lose said cash. 
So either learn from your experience or from that of others. That choice is up to you.

One of the nicest features in the latest release is that you **don't need to trust** reddit nor bitcointalk. Armory versions are wrapped in digitally signed packages, and Armory downloads them from secured seed boxes and **verifies** its updates locally.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:08:04
I think that's true.
What we're seeing now is that mining is relatively cheap with a) faster ASICS coming online due mainly to Moore's Law that the bitcoin network still hasn't caught up to and b) Miners dumping block rewards so as to at least pay off the hardware cost.
The result we're seeing is that difficulty is rising fast: 20% every two weeks for the past year, instead of every 10 minutes per block we're witnessing 'inflation' of every 7-8 minutes per block. Supply is high right now.
This will likely end early next year and for sure in 2016 when the network catches to Moore's Law at the 20nm node and later, in 2016, the reward is halved to 12.5BTC/block.
Then, it will most likely depend a lot on how well bitcoin is able to disrupt the financial sector.
tl;dr - we're seeing a local glut due to miners dumping block rewards.

The truth:
1. As new manufacturing nodes come out (130nm-&gt;80nm..20nm) all previous generation ASICS by definition suffer a 30% loss in terms of both performance and power consumption.
2. ASIC manufacturers are taking first silicon and hash with it, using it's most profitable period. Then, and only then, do they put it out that silicon to market. It's called burn-in, wink wink.
3. There's a VAST gullible market (centered around the 'to the moon' theme) that prepay for said silicon, and when it finally arrives, the network has already hardened several fold. The action verb for that is BFL'd.
4. Unless you can get free electricity, fast cheap network bandwidth and access to first silicon, your chances of breaking even are a lot less than 50%. Mining is getting to be highly centralized around pros.
TL;DR - if you think bitcoin will go up in the future, best action is to buy bitcoins, not hardware mining. 
If you're interested in the fun aspect of mining as a hobby - get a few miners, plug them in, when the network hardens find out about [overclocking them]( - it's tons of fun.

(repeating reply): It doesn't really compare. The whole concept is different.
Armory was built from the grounds up with operational security in mind.
Among other things, it's manifested in:
* torrent downloads of new version from secured seed boxes that the local copy can verify via signed packages.
* built-in fragmented backup feature.
* HD wallet (new address generated for every receiving transaction) - not sure, but I don't think electrum has that.
    
* Uses the full security of bitcoin-qt to connect to the blockchain
* Doesn't rely on 3rd party servers.

I see your point, it is valid - but I disagree with your conclusion. Perhaps we're simply striking a different balance. 
I've been following Armory for quite some time now on one hand - and in the other - I've been reading the sad sob stories of hacked wallets/exchanges/phone apps. It is my opinion that the balance between the two has now been struck. IMHO, Armory has arrived at a point that it can save many coins from being stolen. I couldn't recommend it before mainly because it was unstable, a resource hog and simply buggy.

For example: you could walk with 100 Million $ worth of BTC across any airport, totally secured. Case in point: there's a ~$6 billion honey pot in the form of bitcoin protocol security waiting to be cracked - the fact that it wasn't yet says a lot about it's level of security. The fact that no government has been able to shut the protocol down.
If you did pass the 'understood' phase, you'd know that the fact that the reference client is written in C++ has nothing to do with the idea behind the invention called 'the bitcoin protocol', written in English on 8 pages.
If you did pass the 'understood' phase, you'd know that that invention is a foundation layer for a lot more than simple currency.

The fact that the private keys are kept on an offline computer that never sees the internet. The only way to release funds from your stash is to get the transaction on a USB thumb-drive, walk it over to the offline computer. Have it signed by Armory offline and then have it broadcast to the network. This way, any malware/virus/hack that happens to make its way onto your online computer can do nothing because you maintain a **strict** air-gap between your online and offline computer. The offline computer is like a treasurer that signs company checks. Anyone can write them, but only he can sign them. Without that signature - the check is worthless. Take the time to read the presentation on [this page]( carefully.


Bitcoin-qt is the 'reference client' - it went through the most rigorous scrutiny regarding the security of interaction with the blockchain. Armory does all the interactions with the blockchain using bitcoin-qt, so it has all the security features of bitcoin-qt and adds all the benefits of cold storage, fragmented backups etc. Take the time to read [this page](

That's a great, valid question. Thanks for that.
The issue of trust is paramount here, I agree. The code is open source, for what it's worth. Alan Reiner has been running the project for a few years now. You can check up on him. Armory project has been funded by VCs ($600,000) and the software itself has been downloaded upwards of 100,000. 
Try this: create a wallet in Armory. Create a paper backup (or fragmented backup). Then, destroy your wallet, destroy your Armory installation and see if you can get your coin back just from the paper backup. It's after this test that I started developing trust in the software.  
Other than that - trust is just ether. How can you trust anything, including yourself? Where do you keep your BTC now? Can you *100%* trust it? Really?

They'll need to pay GST once, not twice, from what I understand. Full Singapore GST guidelines [here](
If they then keep the BTC and later sell it for fiat, that transaction is an income tax event.
If they buy in BTC and sell in BTC they are an intermediate entity and don't have to pay GST.
GST is a 'chained' tax that is levied **once**, on the end consumer of real world goods/services.
GST is exempt if the transaction is virtual (BTC for WoW gold etc).
tl;dr - Singapore is treating BTC like cash transaction for real world goods/services and exempt it for virtual transactions.

Your analysis is airtight EXCEPT for your assumption about how much impact this would have on the price. 
The amount of bitcoin auctioned is insignificant relative to the amount circulating, so the actual effect will depend on psychological-economical behavior which is much less predictable.
TLDR - coins will be sold at above market price and this can create a trip to the moon or a tiny blip or anything inbetween

I bought a 5 block erupters (333Mh/s each) and started mining end of October. At the time they cost $16 each. Here's what happened since:
1. I learned a WHOLE LOT about the bitcoin network - just figuring how to set up a full node, the differences between pools, and a whole set of mining terms and jargon.
2. The difficulty tripled since I started mining, so I got into the fascinating area of overclocking the miners. A whole set of new skills and knowhow.
3. Bitcoin price rose sharply, and the miners managed to mine 60mBTC so far, about 50+ USD so 3/5 are paid for.
5. I'll keep finding new ways to overclock them until they either die trying or difficulty will make it senseless. At that point I'll frame them and take a snapshot of my wallet with all the minted coins transactions as a nostalgic piece back when you could mine bitcoin at home. 2014-5 are probably the last years it'll makes ANY sense. 
6. The price of these miners doubled since so if I want to, I can sell them now and come ahead dollar wise, but it's too much fun.

OK - I see your point now - Thanks for that clarification. 
wrt/ openssl as an example- no one I talk to likes it. Discussions at the mailing list of bitcoin-dev show not much love there either - but it's the best we've got right now, and it is at least an open standard and it's been field tested long enough to be declared battle tested. 
That's the thing with crypto in general - it's such a tough math problem, that's all you can hope for: an open method, extensively reviewed and field tested by many for a long time. Bitcoin relies on SHA-256/ECDSA, and I fully agree that if **that's** broken - bitcoin is gone. But the invention of the protocol and block-chain isn't - a new, better coin will rise from Bitcoin's ashes - I'm sure. 
You seem to be positioning Bitcoin/openssl/crypto in general competing with perfect. EVERYTHING fails in that competition, but (Bitcoin/openssl) do well in the 'good-enough' arena. 
In the real world - usually 'good enough' get's deployed and sticks and get used and gets improved on a need-to basis. Perfect just gets written about and theorized in Academic circles.

BTC is not fully decentralized - some examples:
1. Mining pools (less than 10 significant pools) centralize most all of bitcoin mining.
2. The core-dev team (less than 10 active participants) makes a consensus based decision on the features of the bitcoin protocol.
3. The network effect of bitcoin coerces almost all development in crypto-currencies to be bitcoin like or bitcoin related.
4. Most of the bitcoins in existence are centralized with relatively few people, and most bitcoins are in dormant accounts (relatively few are actively traded).
5. Most of the hashing power is centralized around few participants (the hardware mining companies).
6. Most of the transactions between fiat currency and bitcoin occur through few gateways.
And to answer your question directly: because of bitcoin's central network effect, the only way to create innovation in the crypto-currency space is to somehow hook up to it - either via OP_RETURN or 2-way pegged sidechain.

Well - that's *exactly* the point - nothing. Nor did coinbase and bitstamp yet. However, so did MTGox up until February, and NeoBee up until March. 
So the point is that with Armory, you don't need to wait until something *does* happen - as Armory offers better security than any third party can afford **by definition**, - you remove most all attack vectors (there are no known malware/viruses that can jump across an air gap). Please, check it out, even if you don't end up using it, the lessons you'll learn in operational security will serve you well.

Overall good procedure: here are some extras:
* between step 4 and 5: install truecrypt and do entire disk encryption on the cold storage drive. It'll need it's own password to boot the drive or wake it from hibernation. 
* Create a wallet with a tiny amount on the online computer. It's called a **Canary Wallet** - if it get's stolen it's nothing significant financially but like a canary in a coal mine - alerts you to a probable breach of security.
* Laminate the paper backups so they'll last.
* The USB stick that's used for signing transaction should be formatted and used for that purpose only. Ideally it should be with as little space as possible so that it can't carry a significant malware payload. 128MB is good.

 I think online consumer transactions are needed to be broken down to the following cases:
* online with a large merchant (tigerdirect/overstock) - these btc transaction are reversible.
* online with a single person (ebay/craiglist style) - these btc transactions need escrow/multisig and I agree the infrastructure isn't there yet.
* online across national borders (trusted merchant) - that's where btc shines because however you cut it, it's way cheaper and faster than international wire transfer
The point is, merchants need to treat btc transactions as cash and as such give a cash discount equivalent to at least the percentage the CC companies charge them. That'll be a fair balance between price and risk.

* Distribute the fragments across geographies, with semi-trusted parties.

Fiat **may** be backed by gold, some **have been**, but currently no fiat fully is.
Ask yourself - what's backing gold? See what I mean?
Trust is the currency underlying any exchange - the trust by the one accepting the currency that it can serve as such at a later time. That's all there is to it, and is the reason that there is no such thing as 'inherent value' to any fiat currency (gold included):

The point is to use Armory to store that majority of bitcoin that you **don't** need to convert. The relevance here is that the GOX'ED and BEE'ED used the exchanges as cold wallets. 
I've used MTGOX and the only reason I wasn't GOX'ED is that the coins were out of there within a few minutes. I don't think I was just lucky - I also was very prudent about it.

Replace "coinbase" with "MTGOX" and roll back time 2-3 years.
Why are you assuming that past performance is any guarantee? Have they been **fully** audited? Are they **regulated?** Are you insured FDIC style against their failure? Haven't you learned anything from mtgox?

For high worth and advanced users - Armory beats EVERY wallet that's out there. The level of security it provides is unparalleled. 
Having said that - it does require effort and is not yet bug free (but it does work!). 
The current version, 0.90 beta has fragmented backups and is stable enough to run the online half on a 2GB ram win64 machine with mostly no issues. 
However, it does require patience -  running a full bitcoin node (helping the network infrastructure) + 20GB for Armory's blockchain + working with beta grade software. 
The level of support on the Armory forum thread on bitcointalk.org is great.
tldr: not for everyone, but for anyone with high worth and patience.

Let it sync overnight or when you don't need the PC for a while. 
The new torrent download really speeds things up. Yes, it does take time to build, sync and scan the blockchain initially. However, once it resides on you HD, it should take minutes to have it up and running.

If you can possibly get an old netbook/pc that can function as an offline - that'll be best. Seriously consider this if at all possible because ANY other scenario is inferior. Lacking that you would need to:
 * Run the laptop in online mode, have it synced, generate a transaction and copy it to USB stick.
* Reboot into the live CD/usb with the offline wallet.
* Insert the USB that has the unsigned, sign it with the offline wallet and have it saved on that same USB stick.
* Reboot into the online laptop, wait for the sync and broadcast the transaction.
The cons of this procedure compared with an offline netbook:
* You never really know what's in your online PC. A hardware keylogger would work across boots. 
* That USB that stores the offline armory could have malware.
* A used, beat offline netbook cost can be had for a lot less than $50. I know someone who uses a netbook with a broken screen and 512M of memory as an offline. He hooks it up to an external monitor for the 1 minute it takes to sign a transaction. Almost any old throwaway should be sufficient

Also, anything probably "could be done better...", and I don't think bitcoin is competing with perfect. Like the internet protocol, it is just good enough.

Here is a solution for you, given that you have :
* Get a cheapo netbook (can be had for &lt;$50). That will be your offline computer. Have truecrypt on it, and Armory with encrypted wallet. That'll be your cold storage.
* Hide it in your car. I'm talking **really** hiding it like behind a paneling, not in the glove compartment.
* Make fragmented paper backups and distribute them across geographies. This takes a lot of thought because they need to be accessible in case your car is stolen. Friends that can email you the fragments etc. 
You now have a secure setup that won't fail if the car is stolen. You'll just need to recreate the wallet from the fragmented backups - so put a lot of thought who you can trust to help you with that, but still not put all the trust into too few hands.
In addition, keep some on blockchain.info wallet. Between all bitcoin companies - their wallet is the best because they don't actually have the keys. Make sure you use 2FA and make a backup per their instructions.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:31:07
Not true. In fact, one of the first things you're encouraged to do after creating a wallet and making a paper backup is to **delete** your wallet, destroy your Armory installation and then recreate it from your paper backup. It was only after this step that I started trusting Armory.
Your paper backup is forever. 
The above was from day 1. The new version is just **so** much more stable, so much faster and feature loaded that I'd really like to see more people use it.
If there's something I hate to read on r/bitcoin - it's the sob stories of hacked wallets/exchanges/phone apps. Armory goes a long way on that front - you should really give it a spin now.

What it means to run Armory is (full hardware cost):
* Have a PC that runs bitcoin-qt. That takes 18.5GB of disk space and needs at least 2GB memory, and internet connection. It'll take about 6-8 hours to download and sync to the blockchain, but after that, the memory footprint is just 100MB and syncing takes minutes. 
* Have Armory run bitcoind and create its blockchain. It currently takes an additional 19.7GB, so total with above is about 40GB disk space.
* In terms of network bandwidth, the requirements are negligible.
* You'll also need a pc that will never touch the internet - EVER. It will only host the offline wallet - any junk netbook/laptop capable of running Windows XP or above will do.
* You'll need a formatted USB thumb-drive to move transactions across the air-gap between the online and offline wallets.
* Some patience going through the learning curve.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:19:28
It doesn't really compare. The whole concept is different.
Armory was built from the grounds up with operational security in mind.
Among other things, it's manifested in:
* torrent downloads of new version from secured seed boxes that the local copy can **verify** via signed packages.
* built-in fragmented backup feature.
* HD wallet (new address generated for every receiving transaction) - not sure, but I don't think electrum has that.
* uses the full security of bitcoin-qt to connect to the blockchain, doesn't rely on 3rd party servers.
The cost is you need to run a full node and keep a local copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:32:38
Yes, it is, IMO. ANY other configuration, including 2FA, 2 USB sticks, liveCD boots are all susceptible to hardware key loggers, man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of malware.

The block reward is not charity to subsidize miners for their effort - it is a mechanism to provide fresh liquidity to the bankchain ledger, the unspent transaction outputs - similar to Bitcoin. It is also needed as a way to prove their work and of course - to validate transactions. 
One interesting aspect I think is that miners of bankcoin will either need to mine using a unique algo, or secure themselves from the outside world somehow, or be very powerful. 
Otherwise the Bankchain is at risk of getting attacked by outside miners. I think that's an attack surface the Bankchain has (like any altcoin).
Tangentially, Bankcoin would probably change parameters like block size, average time between block discovery and maybe get rid of the block-reward halving every 420000 blocks.

I would imagine the 'public' to consist of participating entities: It could be 10 banks, it could be 10 branches of a single bank, it could be 10 directors of an operation within a bank - why does it matter? What matters, IMHO, is that the blockchain technology pioneered by bitcoin can be used as a trust-reduced, secured, authenticated ledger 
 in a multitude of scenarios that require these features. Bitcoin is to the blockchain what email is to TCP/IP. A killer-app, no doubt, but only one of many others to come.
I can think of at least two major shortcomings Bitcoin has when it comes to banking:
* No Turing-complete language for complex contracts (etherium style).
* No internal core-devs to tailor the protocol to its needs (e.g. how often blocks are discovered) 
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:31:18
No you don't - it's transparent. Any mining power change would be reflected on 'bankchain.info' .
The one whose trust you want to reduce are mainly the army of accountants and auditors that are needed today to verify transactions (e.g. Visa) or rogue sysadmins/hackers that can tamper with the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:25:04
The ones whose trust you no longer need are:
* Rogue sysadmins and hackers tampering with the ledger.
* Disgruntled employees stealing identity.
* Other external entities destroying a central database
* A legion of accountants and auditor verifying transactions
A blockchain is stronger than a legal obligation in that it is trust-reduced by design.

Assuming the bitcoin economy is a free-market economy then that economy has a daily demand of ~$800,000/day just to keep BTC/USD at it's current level:
24 hrs * 6 blocks/hr * 25 BTC/block * ~$230/BTC = ~$800,000/day.
Now assume the halving happens tomorrow, and daily supply drops to $400,000 worth in BTC. The demand for the remaining BTC will pressure prices higher until a new equilibrium is reached from supply in stock (hoarders sell to profit) and readjustment in the mining market.

There is no 'centralized authorization source' handling identity credentials. Read up on the Byzantine Generals problem. 
The identity is provided by the wallets and transaction signing.
Initially, some committee needs to lay the ground rules for the system - just like there was one guy Satoshi who laid out the ground rules for Bitcoin. Once its distributed, it is transparent and trust is lowered.

They wouldn't need to trust each other's legal obligation/rogue sysadmin nor maintain an army of transaction auditors.


I disagree. Any blockchain with equal mining power among participants decentralizes trust (you still need to trust 51% of the miners, if that what you mean, but that is the same with the Bitcoin blockchain).
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:11:54
Here is what I think banks have in mind that relates to the Byzentine General problem that bitcoin solves:
Suppose there are 10 different (non-trusting) banks that need to communicate with each other without a central SQL server or auditors.
* They agree to create a Bankcoin blockchain that's accessible only to the ring of 10 participating banks.
* Each bank has a Bankcoin miner and a Bankcoin wallet.
*  All miners have equal hashing power and everyone can see every other's miners and transactions a-la Bitcoin via some Bankchain.info site.
* So every bank mines one block in 10, on average, and can use the mined Bankcoin 'reward' or a fraction of it to transmit transactions to the public Bankcoin ledger representing whatever (bank assets, contracts etc).
And there you have it - a decentralized, low trust private transaction system.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:33:43
It's 'secure' as in that no one rogue bank/sysadmin/auditor can forge transactions , steal identity or tamper with the bankchain (credit card style).
It's 'decentralized' as in no one entity holds the ledger or has higher privilege than the others (federal reserve style).
As for cost relative to Bitcoin blockchain - it is not an issue of cost. It is an issue of control. With a private chain - the fate of Bitcoin is of no concern to the 10 banks ring (e.g. the civil war erupting due to BitcoinXT).

So here's the short version of the process:
* A miner finds a block, but that's not enough because...
* That block has to be validated by the majority of the full nodes and there are many of them (hopefully you'll join). So the miner transmits his new found block to the network, hoping it will get validated quickly by the network. But...
* UASF Segwit nodes won't validate blocks that didn't signal SegWit and won't retransmit them to their connected nodes. So...
* The effective result is that miners that signal SegWit will get their blocks broadcasted by ALL nodes but miners that don't will get rejected by some of the nodes. 
This is your power - you can make a difference simply by running a full node that is configured for UASF.

I'm assuming you have a Windows machine and know how to check disk space, download software and run it - it basically boils down to this:
* Check you have around 150GB spare disk space.
* google "bitcoin-0.14.1-bip148_segwit0.3-win64-setup-unsigned" 
* Download and install from the bitcoinreminder site.
*Here's a more elaborate [for dummies guide](
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:50:38
Here's a first-order economic model to consider:
Just to keep the BTC price stable around, say $250/BTC, the current daily demand needs to absorb the freshly mined daily supply:
~250$/BTC * 25BTC every ~10 minutes = ~$900,000/day that are produced by mines and are absorbed by demand each day.
So given that demand stays same through the halving event, and since miners supply will be halved, the remaining demand must come from somewhere else - and the only other source is current stock (holders). 
Thusly, if BTC price is assumed to stay the same, $450,000 worth of BTC must be sold daily by current holders just to keep the price at current levels.
There is  no incentive for holders to keep BTC prices down (on the contrary), so this first order model predicts that a new equilibrium will be reached at around twice the current price (not withstanding speculative activity before, during and somewhat after the event).
Second-order effects could change the short to medium term price, but given no spectacular black-swans (SHA-256 failure/catastrophic bug etc) - this approximation makes sense.
Second order effects:
* New utility/use for the blockchain - increase demand.
* Lost bitcoins - remaining bitcoins value increase all things being equal.
* Legal and issues can swing utility either side.
* Technical issues can swing utility either side

Jimmy Song analyzes many possible scenarios except the most probable one so far:
* August 1st sees UASF armed with &lt;&lt;0.5% of hashing power and is therefore a non-event.
Evidence (denominated in bitcoin economy assets):
1) [Full nodes count]( are at a dismal 795 (&lt;10%) out of which only 340 (&lt;4%) signal with code. Even worst - the trend has leveled off and even beginning to decrease. That has to increase five fold to even start making a difference.
2) [Hash rate signaling UASF]( is at a dismal 8PH/s out of 255PH/s at slush, and slush itself is 4.4% of total hash rate.
 **Even if this multiplies 100 fold, you can't in anyway meaningful split a chain disruptively with such low hash power.** If it was possible, it would have been done a long time ago.
3) Negligent developers support for UASF. In fact, apart from Luke-Jr signing BIP148 binaries, and Eric Lombrozo twitering - I can't see ANY of Jimmy Song development scenarios happening. gmaxwell, sipa, bluematt, and most others are vehemently opposing UASF for its disruption effect and lack of concensus. 
4) No evidence of support from major economic nodes such as exchanges.

Let's count how much of an underdog this effort is:
* There are about 800 [full nodes signaling UASF]( but only 40% of those do so through full nodes. The reset just added a comment to a conf file. However, lets suppose they ALL change their software and run economic nodes and by flag day we have 800 full nodes signaling BIP148.
* Let's also suppose EACH such node operator sets up and runs an S9 antminer or equivalent - putting their electricity where their heart is. That's 10PH/s =0.16% of total hash power.
* Let's also suppose that this isn't optimistic enough, and by flag day above numbers will double, along the lines they did the past two months (even though above link shows clear saturation), and all these new joiners run an S9 or equivalent.
Result - UASF camp reaches flag day with ~0.3% hash power and turns into a non-event. 
This is coming from a segwit supporter that runs an BIP148 signaling node **and** an S9 signaling so.
Something else needs to happen, and happen soon. Honey badger doesn't care how chatty we all are. UASF need to get hash power to take off.

If anything, it's skewed (arguably absurdly so) towards pro-UASF, of which I'm counting myself in.


No, there's hardly 7.5PH/s on slush, used to be 8PH/s, of which 13TH/s are my miner. That's not nearly enough to lift off UASF, and that's the point of my calcs.
Please enlighten me with yours.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:07:32
Bitfury never claimed to support UASF and are not signalling so (I'd love to be shown a link otherwise).
As for slush - they have less than 8PH/s on BIP148 (13TH/s from that are mine)  btw. We are ~3% of their hashing power, and they are ~4% of total hash power. 
So please.
How is your miner doing, by the way, or are you all talk?
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:42:24
As much as I hope I'm wrong, with 0.3% hash power (and I was **very** generous assuming that) the probability of reorg risk is negligible. 
If we reach mid July with these numbers (and that's saying a lot - chances are we arrive with a fraction of that), no exchange will offer an alternate 148coin or replay protection, nor a speculation war will start because UASF will be a DOA non-event.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:48:56
All assumptions are heavily skewed towards pro-UASF, arguably absurdly so.
You can run any software you like - that's very true, but if you don't have some hash power to back it up (some being &gt;&gt;0.3%), honey badger don't care.

Factually wrong. Signalling SW is not equal to signalling BIP148. 
The later rejects non-SW blocks starting flag day. The former does not. The latter splits the blockchain. The former does not.

I think the issue is a lot larger than that:
 The issue is *who holds the keys to the kingdom*. Is it 
1) consumers 
2) merchants
3) full nodes
4) financiers (hedge funds, corportates)
5) exchanges
6) developers
7) miners
Of the list above, miners became so concentrated that they impose a risk far far greater than a costly 51% attack: they hold the economic majority (1-6 above) hostage.
That, in and of itself, justifies BIP148.
