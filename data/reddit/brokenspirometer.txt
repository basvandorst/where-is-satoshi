It doesn't matter if the dollar has seen hyperinflation. If BTC is popular enough to be used on shopping channels, then 0.185 BTC will be a huge amount of money no matter what a dollar is worth.

MDMA is a dopamine agonist and an amphetamine. It is almost certainly addictive to some degree.
Of course it is not nearly as addictive as opiates or crack, but I would rank it with caffeine and weed.

They locked down BTC transfers too? That is a huge red flag. When they stopped doing USD transfers, at least they could pretend there were technical issues with bank stuff. But there is no excuse for preventing BTC transfers. The *only* reason they would do that is they just don't have the BTC to transfer.

If you have funds in MtGox, shouldn't you buy BTC at their bargain-basement price and then transfer your BTC elsewhere? Or have they locked that down somehow?

In the last year that has started to change. More than 25% of Comcast customers now have native IPv6 enabled by default (alongside IPv4 of course). I use it at home. Google and Facebook have offered native IPv6 service for years.

After what happened at MtGox I think a little fear and doubt is justified.

Never heard of Red Light Center before. From what I read on Wikipedia it sounds pretty fucked up.

Only until you're an adult. Then, stupid bosses rule the world.
