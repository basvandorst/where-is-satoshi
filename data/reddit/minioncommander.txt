My point was basically that I was questioning what you said because the way you said it made it sound like you weren't in the group of people you were claiming would be there.
But I guess you just said something weird trying to put it in non-technical vernacular, which makes just as much sense.

This comment sounds like someone who has never written code in their life, just FYI

Yea this person is right, people on the internet might get upset.
Now that I think about it, I think we have to shut the whole fucking planet down.
It’s been a blast folks.

It’s fine, all the problems will be resolved when we restart it.

I asked how much of their money are you entitled to?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:55:04
I hate reddit. Why do you assume that because he doesn’t think the rich are 100% evil that he thinks they are 100% good?
Because your ideas are so ridiculous that you need to straw man the opposition as even more ridiculous so you don’t succumb to the cognitive dissonance?
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:04:18
How much of their money are you entitled to, exactly?
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:16:40
Also a consistent level of inflation would mitigate the effect they are describing because it’s not like the people getting “the new money” last don’t know it’s not being printed. This whole post is so fucking stupid.

I’m not really sure who is in charge of math but surely they have to be more legislatively efficient than our government

It is arguably moral to let people with a massive positive impact on the world take the lives of others so that they may live longer.
In a dystopian sci fi sense of the word moral.

Yup; it’s similar to my easy trick for starting a billion dollar company in a week with only $1.
Found a company with 1 billion shares. Sell yourself a share for a dollar.
Billion dollar company.

Too late! You can still get $4,800 from me though if you act now!
Don’t panic - there is still time to sell!

The problem is that many of these couples have most of their value in assets so negotiations may occur as to who gets what and then by the end of it the bitcoin is suddenly worth have as much and the deal is bad.
Gold and silver don't do that.
Obviously the solution is to split the crypto in half. Don't know why people are bitching about it being unsolvable.

Well now the concept of the government seizing and pocketing illegal money makes more sense

It would be super cool if there was a readable main file that was less than several hundred lines long. Maybe there is I have just never looked.

Do you not see how a currency that has to be invested into value creation or lose value is a good thing?

As someone that programs in more than 15 languages, "stackoverflow [new languge] [common concept]" is by far my most typical google search.
EDIT: I see that your comment was based on your interpretation of "is how I get around" as "I am literally dependent on Stack Overflow even in my primary language" and likewise agree with your opinion.
