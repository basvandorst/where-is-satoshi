I've been using them since 2013 and started using GDAX when they launched it. For the last several months i've been moving small and mid-sized USD amounts through ACH onto GDAX to buy. I honestly have not had any issues. I don't always agree with the political decisions made by Brian and team, but they seem to be running a fine ship. 
I also got one of my friends into BTC recently - they bought with a card through coinbase and he did complain about a small ~30bps pricing gap between what he calculated he should have bought at (with fees) and what coinbase told him he bought at.
TLDR - I think most of the negative sentiment is exaggerated, but I would encourage just waiting for ACH funds to settle before buying. it's not the worst thing in the world to have to wait 3-5 days to buy btc. Because of that very reason, I just bought BTC at ~800 vs. 1100.

A future (likely long down in the future) could be to extend this to regular stocks and other behavior controls (don't check Facebook for 5 hours so you can focus on homework)

I stored coins on CB from 2013 through 2015 and used their "vault" service when they launched it. Around the time of the bitfinex event (can't remember if it was before or after), I moved my coins out of the vault and into a cold storage wallet. I came around to the view that sooner or later CB will get hacked (whether that's 10 days from now or 10 years, and whether the scale is 10 bitcoins or 10,000). 
Not sure I understand your question about GDAX. If you mean to ask whether it's better than the traditional coinbase, I would say yes. I have paid maybe $1 in fees through GDAX vs. the $25 I paid for one transaction through coinbase. 
Edit: I wanted to add: My friends have been reluctant to move their bitcoin out of coinbase (they use the "vault"). I don't worry about it so much because I think the community is figuring out way to make the exchanges safer. Coinbase, for example, apparently has insurance that will cover your USD value of bitcoin in the event of a hack. For my friends who view bitcoin as a commodity investment, that is sufficient. And to their credit, I think bitfinex handled their hack in a pretty good way.

That blows - reading the tea leaves around these kinds of things can be difficult. Maybe they have humans doing the verification and someone applied judgement that was later overturned. 
Hope everything works out. Hang in there
