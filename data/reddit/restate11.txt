Assuming you're trying to convert crypto to USD/fiat money? Not sure if you'll have an easy time of that on any of the exchanges, being a minor. Perhaps your best bet is to find a non-minor friend and send them the crypto to cash out, or find one of those localbitcoin organizations.

A paper wallet is simply a random key pair. That is, an algorithm take one string of random plaintext that meets the cryptocurrency’s format (different for each currency) and changes it in specific ways to another string of plaintext. In the case of bitcoin for example, the random key is converted to a wallet address via this algorithm (that algorithm is called SHA-256). This wallet address is not hanging out on the blockchain, already generated, waiting to be used. It becomes known to the blockchain when bitcoins are sent to it. I’ve wondered myself how this could possibly lead to duplicate wallets being created, however the chances of this are very small. And I’m guessing the network would reject a duplicate and refund a tx but don’t know that for sure. 
The “offline” nature of the paper wallet simply means that the key is not exposed in any way to the internet. That key is the only way to get at the crypto and be able to spend it. 
The security of bitcoin is inherent in that the wallet address cannot be converted back to the key. Currently, to be able to work backward and generate (solve) the key for a wallet address, would take a super computer billions of years. Add a password to that key to encrypt it further and you have even more protection from brute force computer decryption. 
Think I pretty much failed at the 5 year old approach but there you have it.

Haha it’s a bubble by every measure. Something will happen to cause a massive loss in investor faith and interest. Doesn’t mean we can’t milk it on the way up, while being careful to take profits such that no actual loss occurs when things do take a shit. Don’t hope- protect your self Steve! So many reasons.

If he didn't have 2FA enabled then the hacker deserved those coins more than he did (sorry)
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:04:12
Ah yes. Like LoafWallet is deterministic. I get that. Still deterministic wallets rely on software that must not fail. You must still rely on 3rd party software. Mnemonic seeds are not stored on the blockchain, although I do understand that the encryption of mnemonic seeds is standardized. 
Call me old fashioned or stupid, but I just prefer to interact with the blockchain algorithm directly. Long as I don’t fuck up and lose my keys and backups, I find this to be the most secure for me. 
So many software based wallet horror stories I’ve read on reddit, both mobile and desktop. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:00:19
This is why I don’t like relying on software wallets - they are prone to human error. Whereas, so far, the blockchain remains unhacked and trustless. While cold wallets come with their own risks, interacting with the blockchain directly (via simply generating a key pair) is the safest way to store coins. Pain in the ass to spend them but that’s kind of the point...
If you’re new to crypto and want to try your hand at paper wallets, research how to do this securely and do test wallets and get the process down before you send your funds to one. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:13:04
Best way to store is on multiple encrypted paper wallets, backed up to a regular old hard drive which you control and encrypt and never expose to the internet. Then back it up a few times over. Even if found- yours keys will be encrypted with a (hopefully) strong password. Walletgenerator.net
This way you are relying on nobody but bitcoins native cryptographic algorithm. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:25:26
Tell me more! I’m aware of that risk so always sweep entire balances because tbh I don’t understand how else to prevent it.

This guy still can't seem to answer questions about his account security measures. 
Here's the deal, OP: Assuming you were using an authenticator for your 2nd factor, then you've had TWO factors compromised (your auth app and your email/pw to login to binance). They would also have had to have access to your email account, as binance requires email approval for withdraw requests. So let's assume all three of those security measures have been compromised - your binance credentials, your email account, and your 2FA. 
Have any idea where you went wrong???
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:21:28
Hahah good point. Even Vegas reports winnings to the IRS. Real talk tho- cuz it sounds like you know what you’re talking about- can you imagine a 1099 from a crypto exchange? Considering all of the currency jumps one must make- but convert all to usd at every point along the way to come up with some sort of cost basis...what a nightmare.
Complicated by the innate anonymity of the blockchain, that I can xfer coins into Coinbase that I didn’t buy there so Coinbase and therefore the irs has no way of knowing my cost basis. In fact, I could have tumbled those hypothetical coins several times over resulting in no way to determine my actual cost basis. It’s truly an insurmountable problem for the irs and IMO the biggest risk to crypto trading remaining legal. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:55:20
Ah. Sounds like you were accidentally on a phishing site. When you're at work next, check your browser history if available and I'd be wiling to bet you accessed a fake binance (did you happen to google binance to access the site from work?)

Ducking total chaos. Not as bad as if Coinbase went down thought. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:32:24
“this bug only effects online systems and wallets that are not encrypted in any way.”
My other thought when reading OPs post- I have no idea why anybody who creates a wallet does not add this extra password to encrypt the key and/or json file. It makes the key useless if uncovered (assuming one’s pw is strong and not susceptible to BFA, because remember kids there is ‘no maximum pw attempts’ on the blockchain). 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:17:55
So many reasons Steve should not be investing in cryptocurrency...

This made me think of our dialogue: 
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:21:36
Wow the more I read the more I realize my method of security has vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to paper wallets. Per the “bad wallet ideas” article, I’m adding risk by trusting the java based crypto generators. Still not as bad as the author states when it comes to spending from the wallet. Sweeping into a mobile app via qr code is super easy, can be loaded offline and then processed into the mobile (likely deterministic) wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:07:56
Not that surprising since crypto has been their introduction to investing. They haven’t yet traded equities or other property. So many folks don’t know the diff between a market or limit order, maker vs taker, etc etc.

@_date: 2018-01-03 22:44:57
Similarly, downloading desktop wallets to get mnemonic seeds poses the risk of downloading malware. You gotta get really crazy with the validation of dev signatures etc

Wow!! Ouch dude. Really sorry you lost so much. We all have to be very careful obviously. Would you please write the entire story in one comment or as an edit on your OP? I think it would be immensely helpful to the community and all binance users. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:44:29
Yeah and come on...all the security warnings in the crypto space. People think they'll take care of beefing up security later. That they're not vulnerable. Expensive lesson, if his story is even true.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:52:34
I have way too much on binance but im trading it actively so its a necessary evil. I got my shit locked down with multiple layers of security. Trust - if mine ever gets hacked, I will be able to definitively say that it's an inside job within binance, or somebody physically got my phone and cut off my fingers and got me to tell them my long random password before doing any of that. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:26:03
Thanks for explaining this! I figured the chances of duplicate were small. What’s up with the broken wallet being duplicated? What do you mean by broken wallets?
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:31:26
You got it! Except I think it’s opposite- the key is what’s encrypted into the wallet address via the ultra convoluted method. It’s simply cryptography. You do need software to generate the keypair, but need not be online because it’s just math. 
You need software and internet to utilize the wallet. 
Edit: utilize meaning to spend from it. Anybody can send to that wallet address without the wallet (the key) ever seeing the light of day (or the light of the internet, as it were).

No no no- don’t attempt to get off the lift. Just lighten the load- if the remainder keeps skyrocketing you won’t really care and won’t have lost any money. If it crashes, you lost unrealized gains but hopefully will have your principle investment plus some out. Don’t attempt to time it because you’ll get it wrong most likely. My new personal rule is never to “sell all”. Keeps screwing me when I do that lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:05:06
Segwit is only active for like 10% of bitcoin wallets currently. It isn’t the same as the segwit2x fork supposedly happening today. As others have stated, this fork is a bit shady. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:50:33
I’d say set larger margins for the stop loss if you insist on trading with one. Like others have said, the market is too volatile, especially for a narrow stop loss. It’ll often trigger. Also, stop loss sucks because it becomes a market order and your losses may be much greater than they would be at your stop price.  I’d only use a stop loss at a price GREATER than my cost basis. Stop loss to preserve gains makes way more sense to me. 
Limit buys would be more effective no? Since you know it will always rebound (at least for the time being). Then limit sell while things are still in the green. I’ve done well day trading with that strategy. Forces me to buy in the red and sell in the green. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:48:49

What's your goal? if your intention is to sell high and buy low, it could work out well and also it may not. Timing markets is usually not successful.
If your goal was to exploit and gtfo of bitcoin with some profit, then sell.
If history is any indication, bitcoin will prob keep skyrocketing. Will also come crashing down hard at some point. I think if you've made over 100% profit, its not a bad idea to take your principle investment out. Also, you may see things more clearly if you add and average your purchases. More realistic way of looking at it and knowing your actual cost basis for the entire investment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:21:47
I'm thinking so. Wallet addresses are public, as is the ledger, so if that's indeed the wallet address you were using, and it's currently empty, you should see transactions for deposit and withdraw, at least.

Be smart and get rid of your debt. Being greedy could get you burned and you would indeed feel terrible. We are so spoiled in crypto vs equities markets, where 2x feels like a measly return. 8x is ok, but you know it could be better. Hold hodl etc. This thinking has been rewarded so far, and seems like it could always be, but realistically it can change very quickly and all those gains wiped out. 
I personally have been taking profits when I get over 100% gain, not selling all but sort of dollar cost averaging my sales on the way up. Did I miss out on gains because I sold “too soon”? Yup. Did I still 2x + my money and isn’t that awesome? Yup. 
Cryptocurrencies are a speculative asset prone to volatility. That’s no secret if you look at the history. Chances of a correction are high- even the developers of these cryptos are warning investors. 
You will always get another buying opp with crypto. 80% corrections are historically common. 
IMO taking profits is the smart thing to do, just don’t “sell all” and get rid of all of your exposure. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:02
I'd let it get back up to the all time high (around 20K) and then sell a good chunk...probably 5-6 of them. Invest a couple of them in alt coins and hold the remainder to see what happens.

100% agree. I keep some on GDAX for active trading. I know on kraken, you can select what info/ability the auth tokens have (eg. viewing balance only, or ability to trade/withdraw). I’m not sure what user data comes with the view key other than balance, in that example.

That’s the current paradigm that doesn’t really work when you think about it. Most folks need proper custodians. I don’t leave my stocks on Schwab with any fear that they can disappear due to a simple mistake. Nor do I want that responsibility. Securing crypto is fun for me but still a bit stressful, however most people want nothing to do with that responsibility. 
We don’t have the equivalent in crypto. We don’t have reliable custodians and most people cannot be their own bank. This is not something to rejoice if anybody hopes for the values to skyrocket from mass adoption.

You are technically correct, however...well, I just wanted to say that hah
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:11:08
Bitcoin risk is on a whole different level IMO. Apple is significantly less speculative, has a massive amount of people who rely on it daily, and has zero chance of going to zero. That said, it’s price is insanely inflated based on a historical PE ratio, like many stocks right now, but doesn’t much matter because it isn’t going anywhere and such inflation is negated by long term hold in the case of a correction. 
Bitcoin isn’t likely to go to zero either but shows significantly higher volatility and therefore risk. 
I’m saying invest in both and hold but if you already have Apple, hang on to it, because the more a novice investor flip flops between investments, the more they’ll lose generally. Just my experience. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:20:04

If you’re completely new to crypto and wallets and such, your coins are by far the safest staying right there in Coinbase. Throw them in the vault for max security and be sure to use best practices when it comes to account security:
Authy 2FA (never sms)
Strong random password 
Dedicated email addy that you don’t use for other things, which also has a strong random pw and 2FA
Never select to remember your login or keep you logged in without the need for authy code each time. 
Sure Coinbase has some major customer service issues but they eventually make any errors right. I’ve only once had an issue where they locked up some eth for a couple weeks and it was resolved.

They have the right to refuse service to enterprise customers that violate their terms of service.

Dude losing a few bucks is very different to losing tens of thousands or even millions due to a simple mistake. You seem to be missing the entire point here- being ones own bank is largely impractical for the vast majority of people.
