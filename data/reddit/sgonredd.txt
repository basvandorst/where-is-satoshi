When Crypto was on pick , many Gurus predicted good prices &amp; its Future.
Now when Crypto is in unstable state , new Gurus predicting bad things.
So its their part of the Job , that's how they want us to believe how smart they are.Or how much influence they could have 
But actually they are not. just FUDD!
And for your Information LBC transaction fee was always lower than other Exchanger.

But you are forgetting about the time period between 2013 to 2014, it took 4 years to get BTC 80x more
So wait for at least 4 years , if you want to see BTC reached 1,600,000
2022 is near

its  a decentralize coin, where GOD = DOG is not needed any more
For this kind of people gold stand for GOD right now, but we need changes , so society developed a new technology to make changes ,not to repeat same mistake again n again.

Who cares?
specifically who cares him?
BitCoin (BTC)  is decentralized , so no body own anything
,that's the advantage of BitCoin.
Why do you guys making him big? like a DOG! 
Stop on it, it is 2018 , bcash is past
And don't every time make a thread about him, 
those guys don't know , how search engine etc working , those who only believe site names means , it will end with a .com , they deserve to be cheated,either way , they would not able to handle a Crypto Currency. So no sympathy is there.
move on

I am not saying , there is an imaginary boundary there!
So everything is possible
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:45:52
BTC dominance hit 42% today
and good news is market was up in last 24 hours as BTC was up
So price up + dominance up =  another bull run upto 10K
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:52:40
That't mean, BTC price could drop up to 4k-5K level within next few months?
What do you think guys?
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:56:54
who knows!
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:59:25
29th june 2018 is another day , when BTC scroll around 5.8K!
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:58:19
BTC market dominance 42.7% right now
And good thing is BTC price is up 8%+ today
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:17:41
Up - down - infinity
Anything could be possible,you know that.
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:10:47
Last time BTC price around 5.8K was 8 months ago, that was : 29th October  2017
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:11:35
right now BTC market dominance : 42.4%
So next 45% or 40% ?
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:07:40
looks like some one been pissed :p
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:01:06
or Even Russia
So  that would cut the cooling power &amp; save tons of money
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:19:25
Even if BTC reached 1 USD someday.
It will take time to do so, not like it will drop to some random low value in a over night.
So nobody can complain , that their money goes in air within a day
or week.
And I believe that was a plenty of time to decide or re-decide.
And anyway BTC was not created for storing value(investment) . its created for daily transaction for your services.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:22:24

@_date: 2018-06-24 04:59:58
Excited to see it 45% or even 50% again :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:16:11
Soon BTC will reach 45% dominance Level :)
Keep it Up!
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:00:53
Ok ,will see
This market would be down till end of the March or 1st week of April.
Then there will be a rise , not like 11K USD,it would be upto 13K at least.
in August-September, there will be another dip, but at that time , price will be at higher stage of current situation.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:57:02
So as like I said, its expected.
Price could be down below to $7000.
So be prepared!
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:54:39
I am not a troller!
I knew this dip is coming ,every intermediate trader should know this.Its march ,end of the financial Year.
And I knew after April there is a regain again.
So I would advice you all , to re-invest again at the beginning of the April.
If you miss the 10-11k mark,you better HOLD,though there might be a chance of falling the price more , like 6K.
Just saying HOLD word inappropriately HODL ,does not make any one smart!
Smart business is sense the market &amp; anticipate it.
Sell at high price &amp; wait for lower buy order :D
Thank you
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:51:12
Thank you for all upvotes!
I thought this subredit had higher number anti BTC subscribers.
Looks like 79% are not anti ,at least from this sample
margin error 5% though [ignoring other lurking variables] :p
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:11:43
Of course!
though I am sure ,not highest % of BTC users using lighting network,because it is still in the early stage.
And most important thing is ,maximum users are doing transaction through exchanges. So to make a use of it, BTC exchanges should adopt this technology like they did for Segwit &amp; Batch transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:53:33
Why only $30,000?
why not $60,000+ ?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:12:06
I do agree with you.
If you are thinking BTC price would not lower than 7.5K for this month(March),you should hold your invest.
There is no point of sell at low &amp; buy at high.
But if someone suspect that BTC could reach 6K marks again , then my  suggestion is sell now , since you have missed 10-11K (1 week ago).Otherwise you should sell at 10-11K level , not at 7.5K!
Just holding a coin is not a smart move, a smart &amp; old trader should sense &amp; anticipate the market.(Specially if you are watching this market for very long)
That HOLD(HODL!) word was created for brainwashing.
So manipulators can manipulate, knowing there is a strong base, and taking new investor money on the sweep/swing.
So my suggestion we should not anticipate the market manipulator by saying HODL,we should anticipate the market for our own profit,and it will be good for BTC too.
Dip like this , like on December or January or March or August-September are common
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:05:44
not only fee matters , transaction speed also matters
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:16:16
I sold a portion of BTC at 10.5K on end of the February.
Now my buy order pending at 7.2K
I am just hoping it would not drop below 7K or at least 6K.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:05:48
Good then 
He might help BTC (not other cryptos) by place an ad of BTC on Twitter home page just below the tweeter logo!
What you say guys?
I hope this guy would do that in one day!
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:47:54
Just for your information
BTC transaction fee is .00001 for coin exchange like localbitcoins.
For other exchanges fee is lowered to $0.50
Its all happening after implementation of Segwit &amp; Batch transaction
And still now BTC is the No.1 coin,which is considered for paying service fees, where other coins are limited to only investment purpose,which would be a big foose in upcoming days.
Other than Top few coins &amp; mostly BTC ,no coin have the real infrastructure to pay the fee for service (like bitpay,etc did for BTC).If its even there, no service provider accepting it or using it.Because those coin holder considering the coin only for investment, that would not sustain the future of that coin for sure!
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:51:48
My Suggestion
when we can predict a dip like on December , January , March,August-September.
Then why just hold, just sell at the correct time &amp; re-buy at low , that's how we can make more coins for same invested money.
Just doing a HOLD=HODL ,one disagree to take advantage.
I know maximum people following same strategy , buy they never admit it, its another feature of almost all Human!
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:25:06
No its not
At least not for maximum  countries 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:06:24
Thanks for finding it useful :)
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:01:35
Yes, that's the exact point of this topic.
March is End of the financial year , so no matter what dip was necessary by the whales or market manipulator.
So instead of just holding, anticipate it.So not only market manipulator could gain , you could gain also.And if you are gaining, that means there is a competition,which will cause manipulators to make less profit than usual.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:06:14
Don't listen to anyone ,not me , not other so called gurus.
Just watch closely the market &amp; anticipate with it to make more coin with same amount of investment you did for Crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:58:34
Hats off Bernie Madoff

At 9K USD ,BTC dominance = 43.6%
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:22:21
I am saying all this, because ,all I see ,all kind of gurus(from Youtube to TV channel to Social Media) always suggested to just HODL=HOLD 
That HOLD(HODL!) word was created for brainwashing. So manipulators can manipulate, knowing there is a strong base, and taking new investor money on the sweep/swing.
So my suggestion we should not anticipate the market manipulator by saying/typing HODL,we should anticipate the market for our own profit,and it will be good for BTC too.And it would be a smarter move than a typing a dump HODL word!
Instead of just holding,you could make more coins by just selling at the right time &amp; buying back at lower price.
So not only market manipulator could gain , you could gain also.And if you are gaining, that means there is a competition,which will cause manipulators to make less profit than usual.
That does not mean , that I am suggesting Daily Trading.I am not suggesting Daily Trading.
But at least this kind of Dip is very much common &amp; predictable.Not fotr only this year , it would come back again on next year and so.
So why just Hold &amp; watch ,while you could increase your coin amount.
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:42:27
Yes that is good adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:56:45
to avoid 50% hashrate 
And to avoid double spending
And to prevent BTC doomsdays
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:14:34
Those who have bought the BTC at 4K level,I am sure most of them dont have a full BTC.
Yes those who had invested on BTC earlier,at 400 USD,I am sure they have at least 1 BTC.
I am not saying to double your BTC during last December to February , when price does down from 19K to 6K.
But you should at least some x.xx your coin
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:26:58
Its Putin effect , since yesterday ,after winning the election!
But within 1st week of April , it will fall once again &amp; after that it will be up upto 13K marks!
So be ready to sell first &amp; buy again at lower price :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:09:30
Lol , gathering survey is the stupid thing now?
Thanks for the stupidity then :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:25:06
ok lets skip jealous word!
But it is true , till now, those who have not managed to make more BTC with the help of altcoins , feeling unfortunate.
But I am so sure, for most of those altcoins.one day they would go in flick of eye, and all their coins would be worthless.
It would not be like BTC fall , where it took 1 month to decline from 19k to 6k mark. These altcoins would take 1 day like BCC.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:27:51
Good Decision
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:30:57
Would BTC retain 7K+ marks or fall down below that level?
Anything could be happen within 1st week of April 
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:20:14
Ok, so you are waiting for Zero
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:31:21

Till the end of the March , I can't say this is the best lower price of the Year :p
So wait n See

@_date: 2018-03-21 08:17:21
I want to see, what others do think
as like I said ,if same question arose 3 months ago, all most every one(at least those who have BTC) would say , Hell Yes!
they would be 25x+ richer in next 2 years , so hell True! others would have missed that buying opportunity &amp; scratching their head now!
But I don't think , today , people are thinking like that any more
 
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:20:37

Good step
They knew all,they are pro not ordinary
But taking step only after when lots of coins (like BCC) &amp; ICO took peoples money.
Other than BTC all other coins have serious usefulness.
People only investing money on those coins &amp; ICO to make money 2x or 10x or 100x within short period(1 month to 1 year).
They don't have the infrastructure.People not using them for service transactions,etc.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:53:13
That's your point , lets see it
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:01:00

choose your country or currency and buy BTC with your local fiat
Before buying check Seller reputation 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:47:15

Its needed for sake of investor &amp; long live crypto 
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:32:38
When I last transacted 11K was the price of 1 BTC
Now for 11K BTC , I could buy more than 1 BTC, you can do the math :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:14:03
Due to current value of BTC = $10,000+
LBC transaction fee is $1.15 only.
Is there any other exchange which can provide that much cheap transaction fee?
Let me know guys

As you can see , BitCoin(BTC) dominance backing up,while other Alt coins are suffering.
March is bad month for ETHEREUM(ETH) , its now lurking below 520 USD. More down is coming for ETH.
Next turn is waiting for Litecoin(LTC), soon its price will drop below $100,probably within April 1st week.

On 19th February 2018 BTC gained 4K+ within 15 days of interval (from 5-Feb-218 6.9K to 19-Feb-2018 11.2K)
On 6th April 2018 BTC gained approx 4K within 30 days of interval (from 6-April-218 6.5K to 6-May-2018 9.8K)
To check by yourself view here : 
** So million dollar question is **
# On time time ,how much time BTC would take to reach 9K or 10K level again from 5.8K ??
 _Options are_:
1) 15 days

3) 60 Dyas
4) Infinity

Its better to be sooner

9th April of 2018 was the last time when BTC reached 44.5% or more in the total Crypto-currency Marketplace.
After 100 days of period BTC now on the same stage again.
Hope a better future is waiting :)

 Latest Update : 19  July 2018
BTC Market dominance grown upto 43.8% after so many days
Today though other coins are suffering 5% to 10 % loss 
BTC get to manage the loss limited for 1% to 2%

Deposit fee issued extra while you are depositing fund to your LBC BitCoin Address.
It would be auto deducted , so you might include the deposit fee with 1 BTC transaction to get full 1 BTC in your LBC BTC Address.
Also you need to add Bitcoin transaction fee(which is mandatory in this days). The transaction fee would be paid to BTC miners not LBC.
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:01:42
yes anything is possible
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:03:19

And we are talking about only last 2 times

@_date: 2018-04-07 06:24:15
Soon(within next 2 months) BitCoin(BTC) dominance will cross 50%.
And BTC price would back in action in this month. And maximum of Top 10 Alt-coins would be suffered.
So just wait &amp; see.
No need to invest any new money on current market situation. 
Let others(those dont have BTC  or new in the market or have lots of other crypto currency otr have lots of money) do the work for you (:-D 
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:59:19

@_date: 2018-04-05 10:55:32

You should have BTC already! be patient till BTC reach 13K level again!
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:12:18
2K drop within 1 or 2 week may be 
or at least 30% drop of the current price within a month
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:08:44
Yes , That's why you just replied here!
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:29:52

@_date: 2018-04-05 10:21:46
So in this week end BTC price would drop to 6K?
I don't think so
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:18:12
Also he might saw the future 
And he saw at the end of the 21st century , BTC price would have reach 21 million :)  .Thats why he had chosen that odd number 
that's also be possible
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:56:32
Would not break 6K USD level at least!
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:18:27
What do you mean by another Internet thing?
is it about FIAT to Crypto? Because some people calling Crypto could be bring revolution as like Internet does
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:58:40

@_date: 2018-04-05 10:52:55
March month passed, its end of the 1st week in April
So I dont think , BTC would ever come to below 6K level!
6.5K? might be :|
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:46:12
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:54:42
Be patient! , unless you bought ATH or above 15K level
In next two month BTC would be upto 13K level at least
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:03:55
That does not meant , my post deserve 0 up votes or down votes, those haters are belongs to market manipulator bots.They are just spoiling the market &amp; still hurting it.
I meant to say, people had listen to gurus and lost 2k+ profit per BTC :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:37:42

@_date: 2018-04-26 14:50:26

@_date: 2018-04-17 17:45:43
BTC will reach at least $60,000 
I would not say ,BTC would achieve 60K by the end of the year, but 60K would be the ATH for Bitcoin in 2018.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:48:12
Done :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:29:03
Its P2P (Peer to Peer) , so from where server comes?
its decentralized
And to run a node , you need to have 150 GB Software(mostly filled with BlockChain Records)
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:20:53
Its April 1st week.
And BTC dominance is now on 45%+
