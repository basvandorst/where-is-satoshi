I'll again suggest  . It is a crowdfunding platform that will support exclisively projects that are free and open for the public domaine.

If you got your bitcoin after August 1 2017 then definetly no. If you held them before that date it depends on how you stored them.

It depends on the wallet. A super easy multi asset wallet for example is the Exodus wallet. 
But for large Amounts of Crypto I would suggest to use a more secure hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano, etc.) They also support multiple assets.

It would be awesome if you could support 
It is a new croudfunding platform that will exclusively support free and open projects for the public domaine.
A goto platform where people can make a difference with their money!
And they also accept bitcoin!

My E-Mail provider (protonmail) experienced a DDOS attack and the attacker wanted to have 20 bitcoin. I researched it an since then I am in! 
So thanks to Protonmail I now have great mail and great money :)

If bitcoin needs a leader (even if it is sathoshi) there is no reason why anyone should use or trust it anymore. We can all go back to fiat then.
So observe the situation and see if this decentralized system works or if we need an even better one.

In a pyramid scheme the last ones are typically exploited. They bought something no one wants anymore or everyone interested already has, so their stuff is worthless.
But whats with bitcoin?
The last ones that buy bitcoins are paying a high price, but with bitcoin they still have money they can use to buy stuff. 
When bitcoin succedes and the end of the "pyramid" is reached, it is THE MONEY and therefore completly different to common pyramid shemes.
If bitcoin fails tough, it was a bad investment like you could have done in any other technology.

The shape shift support answered and sent me my missing btc. So everything is fine now.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:23:02
I had exactly the same happening 3 days ago and also still no reply from the support. All my litecoins gone so far. Hope they will answer soon.

To understand the value of bitcoin, it is good to understand the current monetary system.
Ask them how much time of their live they spent to earn money.
Ask them where our money comes from. 
Who creates it?
On what basis? 
Can you influence the process through voting? 
Why are some people allowed to create money and others aren't?
After a little discussion the main reason for bitcoin to exist should be clear. You have their interest and can move on to details how bitoin works.

Well, it is just classical gambling on the lightning network. The Owner of the site makes at least 3% revenue. So if you want to loose some Bitcoin, go on ;)

I am concerned that this gets upvoted.
The author of that table has obviously no idea what he is talking about.
He states that the energy consumption of Bitcoin has nothing to do with its adoption.
He could't be more wrong.

Well, nobody knows.
If computers just get faster like they did in the last 20 years, there is nothing to fear.
If there are major technological breakthroughs (e.g. quantum computing) keys MIGHT get compromised.
But always keep in mind that bitcoin is not static. If a real risk arrises, there will most likely be consensus and bitcoins protocol will be updated with adapted security mechanisms. In this case it MIGHT be necessary to move your funds to new, more secure addresses, which on the other hand would mean that coins that are lost today could be recovered in the future by whoever has access to the new technology first.

If you trade don't trade according to charts and patterns.
Only invest in Coins that have a real difference and a usecase.
If you look at a coins website and you can't find out why that coin is really useful in less than 5 minutes, don't invest.
Most of the coins are just some slightly modified clones to make the creator some money but have no usecase.
I increased my BTC by 50% in the same time.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:48:28
Yes, you are correct. I give mixed advice as I have a mixed approach. I only buy the coins I would invest (see your definiton) in. I hold them unless all panicing traders go nuts with a 500 to 1000% rally. Then I sell half of it and buy later again when things have normalized. On a constant steady grow I don't sell.

If it is true, what you say, you are a lucky bastard! ;)
So why use always a new address? There are 2 reasons. 
1. Security
2. Privacy
But first, your example actually is wrong, B does not create a new address to send his coins to C.
Using each address only once means one time for receiving AND one time for sending.
All bitcoin that are contained on a single address can always only be sent as a whole.
So if A starts sending 2 Bitcoin to B from an address containing 10 BTC he can't just send 2 BTC to B, he also has to send the other 8 somewhere in the very same transaction. It is possible to send these back to the address they came from, but then you are reusing addresses. Thats why you send them to a new address you own.
So your example is just:
A sends to an address B never used before and B sends from that address to an address C never used before.
But  back to why use addresses only once.
An address is generated by deriving a public key from a private key through elliptic curve math and then hashing this result two times (sha256 and ripemd160).
So there is no way to get the public key from a known address and if you only tell others your addresses, no one knows your public keys.
As soon as you send BTC to another address though you make your public key from the originating address visible in the blockchain for every one.
If you didn't reuse addresses, the address with the now known public key is now empty.
If not it contains BTC that are now only protected by elliptic curve math (one algorithm) instead of elliptic curve math, sha256 and ripemd160 (3 algorithms).
Furthermore elliptic curve math is easier breakable by quantum computing than the hashing functions. So if you want to be quantum secure never reuse addresses.
In short, it is still tracable, but much harder.
For example if yoj send someone 0.5 btc from an address that contained 2, someone analysing the blockchain does not know if you sent 0.5 and received 1.5 as change, or if you sent 1.5 and received 0.5 as change. Big Data and data analysis is necessary to tell it for sure. There are other techniques available (or being developed) to prevent linking of transactions. But always using addresses ony once is easy and already helps a for privacy.

Yes, you definetely can. I used Android Studios Emulator to test my app (and also Samourai app) for development reasons.
It worked. But I don't see any reason why you would want to do this for a backup.
I also don't know if using an emulator is secure.
Just backup your seed and passphrase, that is enough.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:29:20
Well I don't think this is a problem.
We only eliminate forced trust with this development..
But we still can choose to trust people voluntarily.
I support free open-source software and share images for free on pixabay... why should I stop this when I'm not forced to trust a bank with my transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:45:45
I've audited some parts of the wallet. What I have seen was good code, but NO comments and confusing variable names... horrible to audit for non proffesionals.
I don't understand why they make it extra hard to do this. It's a pitty.
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:24:06
Well, if you already have some btc, you can use Bisq.

Ok, listen. You have a lot of money now, but you are not really happy. You just learned one of the most important lessons in life! 
Happiness​ is a decision! It has to come from inside.
If you learned to be happy, money is a wonderful thing and you won't have to ask others what to do with it. But if you didn't learn it, money won't help you to become happy.
So you are financially safe now. Just forget about your bitcoin for a few years, try to find out what you're passionate about, develop self esteem and enjoy your wonderful life.
And voila, the girls will love you, even if they don't know anything about your bitcoins! ;)
