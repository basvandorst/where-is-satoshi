That's amazing, hats off sir.

 multisig + tor

This is stupid, if it was where I actually keep my coins would be so much more useful.
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:34:34
Neat, will give it a go. I've been looking for a good way of getting push/live callbacks from blockchain events.
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:52:57
Was surprisingly positive, I wish they did it on their Russian version. Bitcoin is a great solution for the Rubble problem.

I can handle rest, and will use CCHMAC to do the authentication, similar to this answer:

When are you bringing the local trader functions to iOS?
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:48:50
Nice post, I'm using this API to develop an app. They have being offering great support.
@_date: 2014-12-10 04:48:24
I'm using Coinkite API to develop my App.
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:34:00
This seem like a very cool idea!
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:57:03
This is what intelligence means, be able to accept you are wrong after presented with enough evidence. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:27:11
coinkite.com because of funds forwarding feature, if you want open source go with Ellectrum.

Since v0.9.3 you can do more than 3 keys (up to 15) as long as the whole "scriptSig" is less than 500 bytes.

Please don't store your coins where you buy them!

**Coinkite Locations are also up to the operator**, here is their map

I really like Coinkite, a lot of multi-signature setup options and a great API.
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:37:07
It would likely be an in person exchange or someone would back a secondary token worth x amt of fiat. Much like Hawala system. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:23:32
You are a Coinbase shill, just checked your history. @_date: 2014-11-18 14:50:12
Well done, more decentralization.

It's a piece of crap because it uses Coinbase. I'm developing a similar app with better options with faster transaction broadcasting!
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:39:01
Love this project, good work!
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:01:55
This is a big deal, we need suppliers to start adopting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:39:00
How did I miss this yesterday, WU is toasted! Has mainstream media picked this up yet?
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:10:24
Coinkite changed, it has been free for a few weeks now. They also offer unmatched multi-signature options.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:32:44
Tell that to Coinbase and BitPay.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:37:39
What a shame, the biggest issue with this network is the complete lack f privacy, I really wish they changed what is required to open an account.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:49:24
I've been using Coinkite to build my App, very happy with it. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:37:03
If you are looking for privacy, look for NON-FIAT bitcoin companies. When companies deal with Dollars they must do KYC/AML, it't not up to them. 
A good alternative is Coinkite, I'm using it to build my app. They offer a wallet and [API]( including multisig and no real ID required. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:44:31
I'm building an iPhone app, do you have your API warper in Objective-C?
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:23:02
Meh, this is not a Bitcoin card, just a way of getting small amounts of fiat out of their account.
There is nothing different than having a USD account linked to coinbase and using my bank card.
@_date: 2013-10-10 12:43:29
So they can spam and up-vote with multiple accounts.
@_date: 2013-10-10 02:29:28
Can't see it.
@_date: 2013-09-26 12:38:03
Go with CampBX.
I can't trust Coinbase, they claim to have 90% of the funds in cold storage, but I really think they just play the market. I'm looking for a full-reserve HD web wallet like Coinkite claims to be, but they have not sent me an invite yet.
@_date: 2013-09-20 15:03:15
Any plans on adding NameCoin?
