What do you mean fundamentals haven’t change? We have bitcoin futures settled in bitcoin approved by sec for two companies. Bakkt is coming.  Halving coming. Spedn app that allows purchases in many major retailers with bitcoin. And I’m probably missing other things. Institutional investors fidelity.

This is the best one so far
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:07:42
If someone controls 51% of the worlds mining power which is highly unlikely due to the resources and money needed.  Or if a serious bug is found that was not seen in the past 10 years also unlikely due to the fact there’s already thousands of eyeballs looking at the code.
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:25:40
But that’s the dollar sign

Once that weird cap gains tax rule is not in the equation I think it will be easier. Why would I want to do  an excel entry for every purchase I make. Just more work.
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:56:07
I agree ever since we gone off being backed by gold and straight fiat with all of the QEs that’s been happening, inflation will definitely grow.  But highly doubt it can get that far out of hand. Needless to say it will be scary and I would not know what to do if a loaf of bread suddenly costs $100.

Are you trading or investing? If you’re investing you should hold for 5+ years. Else you’re trading and you’re not very good at it. So I would suggest you stop.
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:36:53
And waste their time and money? They’ll have to do this for the other coins as well like litecoin and then how about any new forks?
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:55:38

Each block is connected by a hash of the previous block with the previous block having a hash from the previous block and so on. If a block was change by even 1 character then the hash will not match which will invalidate the entire block chain.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:12:53
I’ve asked this question awhile back but everyone says if they tried that everyone will notice it immediately and can also sky rocket the inflation.  Plus a fork of bitcoin and the game starts again.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:32:44
To withdraw what? Withdrawing bitcoin should be pretty instant.  I never waited more than a few minutes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:58:32
Lol you guys are so weak hands
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:41:32
Since it’s centralized it will get hacked easily.no one will use their coin. I’m sure as hell won’t
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:47:29
Down to 11k and right to 15k you guys are so weak
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:06:09

Minimal 10k in summer
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:41:10
No we have $100 bill for the longest time.  I remember there might have been bigger ones but those are long gone.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:16:22
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:09:18
What app  did you downloaded?  You should try abra. Yes you can buy by percentage
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:32:15
Hodl to at least next halving may 2020 it’ll be 30k by then. Always hodl some for life

Good discussion but physical assets can be passed down generations and generations spanning well beyond 121 years. Although in this situation people should send their bitcoin to a new inheritance wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:01:47
Just remember it’s a long term hold like 5+ years, if you can do that then you’ll be good even if it’s a small amount,
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:12:33
Hodl at least 5 years and buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:09:29

@_date: 2019-06-23 20:10:20

@_date: 2019-06-21 21:20:58
You should hodl a small portion to at least 10 years later imho.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:56:16
Lol weak hands will miss out when halving comes 30k minimum
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:17:02
Always send a small amount to test and then repeat process. Also because this goes through exchange you have to rely on their schedule
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:52:32
LOL you guys are such weak hands

@_date: 2019-06-07 04:32:21

With more volume comes stability. We’re just in the early phase. One whale can’t affect 1000 whales.

Bitcoin belongs to no one. We’re all bitcoin people.  There’s no company or leader. It’s just code we all agree to use.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:02:04
Use abra from App Store or Coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:46:24
See if there’s an economy option or a way to specify a custom fee.  Most wallets should have that.  If not there  might be a way to convert your wallet to a segwit wallet which has much lower fees.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:20:50
Can you elaborate? What happens after expiration?
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:39:03

That sounds very risky because people will complain about not receiving them.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:47:00
Where mining reward will be 6 bitcoins instead of 12.  The price will be at least 30k per bitcoin

If it goes to 100k with no dips so never
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:17:51
Can this node mine?
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:18:55
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:09:05
Yes it will drop but then goes back up so hodl
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:06:56
Definitely bitcoin first
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:44:29
Jump in now but just be sure to hodl for at least 10 years and you should be good.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:33:58
BRD app
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:05:14
This is for bip39 12 word seed only with no passphrase?  It’s that many combinations?
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:18:05
Now before it’s too late
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:25:51
CMC still shows 8800 what are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-02 00:42:21
Any time anyone asks you to give money first just walk away.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:42:45

Ya have to pick the right wallet. I’ve been researching myself and checking mempool.space
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:57:04
lol no kidding
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:30:28
Wallet app that connects to block chain directly like BRD with phone turned off. When you want to use just turn it back on.
@_date: 2019-06-02 22:58:11
Buy now before it’s too late.  Any amount is worth fair monetary policy.
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:02:34

Always carry some bitcoin the goal is to own at least 1
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:53:57
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:31:42
Think of it like this it’s the best form of money.

It was a serious question
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:01:12
Unfortunately a lot of people don’t understand how money is created like us.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:24:25
Definitely litecoin
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:45:09
Congrats and always keep some for life.

Yes and hodl 5+ years

@_date: 2019-06-19 00:49:41
I’m not buying coins created out of thin air like Libra!!!Why don’t I create a coin and you guys can buy it off me and we’ll all just call it money.

@_date: 2019-06-29 21:51:19
That’s true hodler!
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:18:53
LOL this is not get rich scheme. If you don’t see the value in bitcoin you should not be investing.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:20:52
Ya that’s normal every exchange has their own policy on the amount of confirmations needed before they show you the balance.  6 is a minimum amount.  You’re good don’t sweat it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:47:44
LOL Hahaha should’ve bought when it was low

@_date: 2019-06-13 01:06:01
Super awesome are you making a profit?
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:41:32
What if there’s a disagreement between exchange and user on the address user specified they sent bitcoin to?
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:28:11
It will be a combination of small buyers that total what you’re selling
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:33:43
Yes if spedn app gets their stuff together so I can start
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:58:21

No longer back to to 4K ever sorry
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:33:44
I think that’s good insight but bitcoin has made it because it’s a global phenomenon and adoption will come soon enough
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:14:30
Bitcoin and litecoin ftw!!!
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:04:58
Bitcoin and litecoin ftw

@_date: 2019-06-03 04:43:15
Great point!
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:36:06
I highly stress to stay away from those and just stay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:08:35
I try to stay away from price but keep on running into these posts lol.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:14:16
But those hardware wallets connect to a third party server so I don’t trust it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:08:36
Lol good ole peter schiff

Wow cool!

Always hodl some for life
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:22:38
Yes except you’re using the wrong coin. Bitcoin is the one you want.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:16:59
They keep telling me it’s too expensive now since 3500
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:07:25
Pumped and dumped lol

Ok well we’ll see in a few days
@_date: 2019-12-06 04:18:05
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:56:35
Asking this question because in the past at one point there was one entity that had that amount of miners.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:35:52
On iPhone wallet and then turning off your phone. Safe and convenient.
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:02:41
What if I want to restore but the original company like BRD wallet no longer exist and the app no longer exists or is supported?
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:57:05
I thought 51% is next to impossible with the size of the network as it stands?
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:29:07
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:30:55
That’s just stating how it works. I mean how to verify the numbers for myself.
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:12:33
So how can we check that is the actual amount that has been created?
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:29:47
I’m not holding if I can sell 1 for a million dollars. And I don’t think anyone would either.
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:36:37
Ok thanks any tools for easy analysis?
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:54:11
Forking won’t work as addresses still hold the fork coins. It’ll have to be a new coin.
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:48:58
Good point 
@_date: 2019-01-03 02:44:03
The latest one I’ve used have yet to crash. Works pretty good so far for me.
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:47:51
They will if they can’t control money like they do fiat.  If everyone stop using dollars and just use bitcoin they will care.
@_date: 2019-01-31 06:00:58
Sorry I actually meant amount coins in existence.
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:38:30
No matter what the 3 things that has to stay in tact security scalability and decentralized for bitcoin to succeed and I sure hope it does.
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:52:28
Isn’t the 12 words that is automatically generated the standard hd seed?
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:05:56
So I can’t use these 12 words on another bip32 wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:00:52
After central bank buys they won’t sell so people can’t buy even if they bid $300k
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:13:57
Abra app
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:22:58
I do hope this community will point out a scam if they see one.
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:34:21
I guess we can at least use it to hedge against dollar inflation.
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:33:06
That’s just stating how it works how can I verify those numbers myself ?
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:03:15
Why would it settle in any currency if everyone used it straight up for goods and services? Ya good ole Uncle Sam will want their tax in dollars but one can dream at least.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:32:26
They can print $21 million now and buy all of it. I don’t think anyone would not sell.
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:08:58
But that can’t happen to all countries unless all governments agree to enforce it. China banning it doesn’t stop Canada from using. Etc.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:47:38
Yes. And why not? It’ll probably be lower since everyone would’ve sold well before then. $21 mil is a drop in the bucket for them.
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:17:17
I’m using BRD 
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:52:12
I do share the same sentiment which is why I hold bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:27:07
Not litecoin. It will be ln compatible as well.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:52:08
Thanks I’m going to switch to my celium do you have a link? Although I still don’t understand the seed numbers you’re talking about.
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:16:11
True but once miners get those they’ll probably sell and central bank would be the buyer once again because they can create fiat at will.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:58:53
Sorry my calculations are off. it would be 21,000,000 x $1,000,000 which would be a shit ton of money. But still it’s not impossible. 17 million in circulation times $100,000 per coin most people would sell already. That would be $1,700,000,000,000 which will make inflation go through the roof!
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:21:31
So you’ll hold a fraction even if it went up to $10 million per bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:00:20
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:35:07
Also you’re not going to know who the purchaser is either if they decide to do this.  You’ll just think the market is mooning.
@_date: 2019-01-28 01:38:56
I’m game. Hey lime boy put your address I’ll send you a little bitcoin. Won’t be much but it’s something.
@_date: 2019-09-11 05:26:52
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:44:33
Download abra app on iPhone
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:24:15
Wuz me
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:45:44
Download BRD wallet and tell someone to send you some.  Good luck with that though.
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:11:54
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:02:51
Ok that makes sense my celium is probably a newer segwit wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:20:35
Same picture 9months ago when it was 6k?
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:10:19
Right made up random words even harder than known random words.  The possible combinations are limitless.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:06:28
Yes I say we’re the first 1%
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:42:49
Just use made up words
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:35:40
It takes time to setup accounts and buy
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:27:05
Good luck with using whatever fiat of your choice when a loaf of bread costs $500.
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:03:57
I’m looking for iOS mobile wallet that has 12 words and pass phrase
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:46:43
Is this a scam?
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:49:27
Just use a phone app for your wallet and turn it off. That’s as safe as it gets.
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:54:06
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:03:53
I think if you put a little and it’s taking forever you can up the network fee and it will go through.  I never tried it but that’s what I heard
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:49:31
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:47:38
How do we know what a wallet is a segwit wallet? Is BRD segwit? Also how do we know if Coinbase use segwit wallets to store our coins or not?
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:37:41
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:08:34
What is derivation path for BRD?
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:10:27
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:06:36
I’m in the middle of deciding using another wallet but don’t know which.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:45:15
I’ll probably sell some to buy back but there will always be some that will be left as bitcoin forever.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:32:00
Is there another wallet that implements similar way as BRD where I can restore?  Else I’m in a risky situation
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:18:35
iPhone with a wallet app and turned off
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:36:07
Don’t sell and lose your position too risky just buy more when you can
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:04:24
Bitcoin and fiat can co exists but bitcoin won’t be subject to inflation
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:13:53
9k in June so you decide
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:27:56
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:28:51
I don’t understand the point of a stable coin.  Why not just keep your money in fiat? Isn’t it the same thing?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:25:34
Why do some wallets have 12 words and some 24?
@_date: 2019-05-24 03:41:38
I hope bitcoin ends pay pal!
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:17:21
I have that but no pass phrase option
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:22:47
Interesting. So are my assumptions correct for sending bitcoin ?
Doesn’t Work;
Legacy to segwit
Segwit to legacy
Legacy to wrapped 
Wrapped to legacy 
Segwit to wrapped
Wrapped to segwit
If someone sends from legacy to segwit or vice versa by mistake are those coins lost? I assume wallets already have built in features to prevent sending to incompatible addresses?
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:09:24
Have a wallet in mind that does this?
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:47:19
It’s the second longest coin ever that was fairly mined and have stood the test of time
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:01:38
Better hedge against the US dollar now.  Just saying.
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:02:59
Is it open source?
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:11:00
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:23:35
The question is whether we can withdraw the crypto we put in the SPEDN app back to our personal wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:12:41
Crypto trading will be dependent on when ErisX completes its product development and obtains regulatory approval.  So still not 100% but futures trading is for special clients.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:01:17
I love the spedn app for this.  Too bad it’s still invite code only.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:24:14
Just pick bitcoin and you’ll be safe
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:29:25
No passphrase just 12 words.  I can restore on BRD on another phone using same 12 words so I know the words are good
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:46:56
Did you choose economy speed? It shows 44 cents for me to send $200.  But I think that’s still a little expensive
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:47:48
10k tomorrow and you will fomo
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:44:12
No but I’m leaning towards blue wallet because of high reviews
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:02:13
Got it.  Should just be 1 input and 1 output as I only transfer one amount from a previous address into this wallet and now transferring out an amount that is less than the amount that came in.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:08:00
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:57:53
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:37:21
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:11:46
It has value because others want it and are willing to give you money goods or services.  As long as that exists people will spend.
@_date: 2019-05-30 05:38:31
The example I have above is harder than bip39 words harder to crack
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:12:01
That makes sense but how can we trust the stable coin is really backed by anything?
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:40:32
I don’t understand I never got option to password protect. Only 12 words and set pin to lock my wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:59:39
But I’ll be in the same situation if the other wallet goes out of business and no longer exists
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:19:01
What is date and time of show for pacific standard time?
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:18:15
BRD wallet
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:06:19
Great news let’s hope it stays
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:50:18
You say that but as soon as it hits 20k you’re going to sell.
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:48:32
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:47:27
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:21:31
Is green wallet open source?  There’s only a few ratings for iOS.  Anyone even using it?
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:43:37
Loaf wallet for litecoin does and it’s not slow 
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:34:52
Don’t trade just buy bitcoin and litecoin and hold.  This will be mass adopted in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:22:38
I’ll believe him if he moves those 1 million bitcoin out of Satoshis wallet
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:14:17
Ok I think I got it thanks
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:30:32
Try a different wallet it’s not that expensive and putting lower fees won’t take forever or get stuck someone said he waited 2 days when he used 5 cents network fee
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:12:40
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:01:24
Is this the reason the price pumped?
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:17:13
Ya compatibility is important.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:47:02
Ya me neither. It does take some time to load the whole block chain initially but it only does it one time.
