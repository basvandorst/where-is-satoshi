why why why why why why why on earth are you storing 50 BTC (roughly $29,000 USD) ON AN EXCHANGE?
this has to be a troll, or the dumbest thing I have read on this board....

Gotta eat somehow, and no one takes BTC... :/

A Croatian sun glasses stall is now using Bitcoin! Mainstream!! Mainstream!!!!!!
I think that's it great that more people are using Bitcoin, but I'd hardly call that mainstream. Something like if Netflix (random example) starting letting you pay your subscription with BTC would be very relevant and mainstream.

Making people accountable for their own money, worth and property? What kind of crazy concept is this? You want to put your faith in someone else to hold onto your money? Go deposit your fiat into a bank, they will keep your monei *very* safe, as their records have always shown over human history.

Breadwallet, in my opinion, is by far the best 3rd party wallet that I have ever used. Simple, straight to the point, and very secure.
One of the biggest pros is the fact that the wallet is **my** wallet, not a wallet that is saved onto someone's server, like coinbase or blockchain.

Lending BTC is **not safe**. There is no surefire way that the debt will be paid back, due to the anonymity.

That assumption could cost you 100BTC

Coinbase and if that is an issue try localbitcoins. Do a quick search for local BTC ATMs in your area, they might cost a few, but worth it depending on how fast you need your USD.
Worst comes to worst try asking around on your local subreddit or this subreddit for people local to you that buy/sell Bitcoin. Or craigslist. But be careful when meeting in person. Always public, safe spaces!!! Good luck.
