They took the coins still on the silkroad site. Not his personal coins which they would need his private keys for.

There are so many other coins now that can take bitcoins place. Gone are the days where btc can easily bounce back because it is no longer the only major contender.

I was one of those page views. Where can I collect my Bitcoin?

Like a PayPal for Bitcoin?

It's for both. If you hold your money and don't lend it out you are losing money to inflation. If you lend your money and don't get paid back you also lose money. Lenders take into account both these concerns.

Nobody is saying to live solely on crypto. If they take their Fiat out of the bank, it kills the banks ability to lend out money. It's devastating for the economy if enough people do it. 
They can use crypto for online purchases and fiat for other necessities.

Along with the uncertainly in regulation it is a risky bet. The only thing that assures is me is that a lot of billionaires are getting in on it.
