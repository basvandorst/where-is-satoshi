Actually if there is a law, it does mean that it isn't stealing. Property is itself a legal concept. If the legitimate government passes a law that says that it owns some percentage of your income, then that income is actually their legal property and not yours. You seem to think there is some 'opt in' system for the laws of nations.
In any case, there isn't a single country that doesn't have a tax of some kind, so the argument is moot. Some may not have income tax, but they are just replaced by some other kind of tax. Unless you were to volunteer for Mars One...

This might be true if you live in some tribe in 4000 BC, but you have to be pretty naive to believe this is still how the world defines property.

The notion that taxes are theft is nonsense. We receive myriad services in exchange for them that, for most of us, would cost far more than the tax we pay if we paid for them directly. Go live in Rapture if you don't like the real world.

You are a citizen of the government, which means you accept the legitimacy of the laws of the land. If you don't, denounce your citizenship and go live in the trees.

Would you be able to labour productively in the anarchy of a failed state where you receive almost no services at all? If taxes are theft, then the extra income you are able to make as a result of living in a stable society  must be you stealing from those who came before you and built such a society.

This is because you are still a citizen of the country and live on the wilderness claimed by the state.

"Theft" - The action or crime of stealing
"Stealing" - to take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.
By definition, taxes are legal, and so they are not theft. To argue otherwise is absurd. If the government taxed you without a law stating that they could tax you, it would be theft. Of course, there is a law stating that they can tax you, so this does not constitute theft. Certainly a citizen can vote to try and reduce taxes, but to not pay legally owed taxes is far worse than the government's act of taxing.

Just curious, not criticizing the idea.

What would be an example of a decentralized exchange? How would these work?
