To use a dollar, do you need a brokerage account?  No, so we dont need everybody to have a Binance or Coinbase account to use crypto? That's just a popular method to get in.

Because you think the value of BTC will increase as time goes on.  People said that to me about AMZN, GE, MSFT when each supposedly "peaked" but look at me now! I have at least $20, muahahahaaaa

Upvoted, not just because Im a crypto enthusiast.  Can you really say its "like bitcoin but controlled...same principles...with unlimited supply?" That seems like the exact opposite of Bitcoin's principles(decentralized, finite supply). But yes, a politician promoting this USDC would say that. "Its like Bitcoin only the opposite of BTC!"

They can control them as well, but i am the "admin" on the app. I can control some of my appliances from afar. If say they push my heating bill over $1000/month, I will turn the heat down to 70F. If they opt to leave windows open in the winter, i can close the heating vent to that room. It was all disclosed plainly in the lease, and I took these measures due to previous tenants habitually running up a $2000/month heating bill a few winters ago. When i lived there it rarely cost me more than $800 to heat the house.

Not to detract from the enthusiasm and message, but during a recession credit dries up. After the housing bubble collapsed, lots of people with good credit couldnt get loans. People with homes couldnt use their Home Equity Line of Credit either. Credit is good, but cash is king.  I had a big down payment ready, bought a short sale for wayyyyyyy below its value.

The 3 people I knew that paid into that werent crypto savy. They are habitual pyramid scheme suckers and were "making so much money that it'd be dumb not to invest more money!"

Have faith! Im a millenial who also rents my other house to an older generation. Muahahahahaaaaaa.   I also installed smart appliances before they moved in. I could turn the heat way down.... if i wanted to!
Edit: Bunch of babies in this Sub. Im joking about exacting revenge on the older generation and am cheering encouragement towards my fellow millenials.

I might try to ride the hype and time a short term strategy. I hate FB, but im a share holder thats well into the black!

Wellllllll..... I have some very old bitcoins that I will never sell because I like seeing the green +XXXXXXX% part on my charts. Still, I play around with shortlived holdings that I always hope to make a profit on, mainly to buy more crypto... and lotto tickets.

Its not the video, its the shitcoin itself. I personally know people who lost significant amounts of money in that scam. They invited me and I said "That's not bitcoin, and the website feels like a scam"   When the friend's wife mentioned they had profited so they doubled their investment I looked closer. Soon i was urging her whole circle of friends to cash out before it was too late. To this day they still say that Bitcoin lost them money and that I shouldnt still be involved.

Try explaining that to all of the sheeple I know. Seriously, they wont believe anything I say about Bitcoin after they heard about Bitconneeeeeeeeeeeect!

Not only barrel shrouds, but muzzle breaks, flash hiders, and recoil directors. And having a broomstick, black paint, plus a pistol grip makes it 43.6% more lethal. Definitely a bannable offense.

I usually hear it as "90% of Americans agree on common sense gun reform"    That is, until the candidate spells put their proposed reforms and I laughingly withdraw any support I expressed.

More secure in that 1. As far as I know, nobody has been able to counterfeit Bitcoin, and it's been open source for a looooong time.   2. You control your own money. No bank or government agency can simply decide to seize your assets or prevent you from using your money as you see fit.   There is still the human element. If you write your online wallet ID and password on a Post It note, then somebody can walk away with your coins in no time.

HODL for now, commence using once you can use it to buy a lambo...on the moon.

Some people get paid more than once in their life. I myself get paid every other week. So I went all in years ago, then I got paid another bonus and went all in again! This year's bonus.... you guessed it, I'm going all in!  My disposable income is almost 100% in crypto!
