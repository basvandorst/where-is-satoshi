Semi rigid. Its terrible to have to work with cause it bends and crinkles, accumulates more dust and lint due to ridges.  Rusts..

Yea I'm not to beat up but it was fun riding thr horse from teetering 6k. I've only got small chump involved. Had I took it more serious a year ago when it was at 1k when I got involved it would of paid greatly. It's fun to watch.

I do it off a tablet through a faucet but its taken a month for 0.0001000  bth which is like $0.3 at 6-9h/s so in all reality what I'm doing isnt worth it.  But it's fun to get a hold of your piece of the pie. So I say good luck! Its the electricity that you burn that kills $$.

@_date: 2018-06-11 23:37:15
From my in-person experience I could only purchase with paper money, neither machine or human would take CC. 
When I did teller he had btc on Coinbase and transferred it, it still cost $13.90 in taxes.

I haven't used that brand but have purchased through atm, teller at a coin store, and the easiest coinbase. The atm and teller was cool to buy crypto in person but theres $10-20 charge,tax.. to where coinbase is $1.99. So say I bought $100 in bitcoin I only recieved $86.90.

I see what your saying but I dont think you can because its crypto and not stable. Idk the terminology I'm looking for lol
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:38:25
Its uses probably.  Because its tied in with the dark net

I've only been in the game for a year so I'm still wet behind the ears on a lot but I have the general purchasing down. 
@_date: 2019-10-21 12:59:29
The only problem I have had recently is that trying to purchase with VPN, coinmama "3d verified security" window would not pop up or redirect. I called CC numerous times to find out it was fine on their end. Coinmama wouldn't process claim with VPN. anyone else have issues with that?
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:24:19
Back when I started you could purchase crypto with almost any CC, now the CC companies don't allow it or charge a cash advance fee. I just use account and transfer but take 8 days till coinbase release it.

You scan your code and it deposit to wallet

Cause it says "regular cash, regular credit." An attempt to make joke against crypto. (Shrugs shoulders) 
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:24:33
I bought 100. It costed 105 and after transfer to wallet i had 94ish. So I guess its not different then a atm that charges 10-12%
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:26:45
And technically i answered your question. 1 way or another you'll have to wait till CB clears you or pay what i call a "convenience fee."

Thumbs up, more opportunities for bitcoins use to grow. Now legally able to buy med/rec marijuana vs its known use for purchasing DNM illegal narcotics.  Now used on both fronts. Genius. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:28:10
Your local coin shop if they sell. I used a coon shop at local mall that does and i gave him cash, he sent btc to wallet via coinbase app. Done

I don't care if people like it. It was more or less for the experience of buying crypto with straight cash vs online. How does this post bring down bitcoins value? It's not a post of bitcoin being used for darknet usage. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:43:17
I did it for the thrill really. I was stoked but I think it gave me the btc st almost 2k higher exchange rate.

Coinpot, but you need like .0001000 min with drawl on btc. I have like .000000013. 
I use bitcoin and ethereum spinner. The payout is higher

You can check with the prepaid cards T.O.S. to see if they allow crypto purchases. 10 to 1 since most CC jumped off the crypto ship in the past 2 years.  Or they allow it but charge a $20-40 "cash advance fees."
