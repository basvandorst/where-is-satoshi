It's obvious he is treating himself on a special occasion, it just so happens that occasion occurs every few hours, and he has a lot of treats.

How long would it take if I did it 3 months ago?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:31:21
Oh you would like to think this subreddit is that important to affect the price wouldn't you? What a smug cunt you are.

Hey chicken little, get that apple dick out of ya mouth when you're talking to us ok? And get back to or wherever you came from.

Of course he hasn't been sentenced yet. But we all know how it's gonna go down in this stupid cuntry.

No, you didn't read what I said. The stupid people are the ones BUYING these worthless coins. Not the people selling them.

BREAKING NEWS: Bitcoin now supports flight
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:39:51
My only issue is that I can't actually get BTC with it using USD, pretty big issue actually. It's a really nice site, real quick and everything. Hopefully they get verification soon.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:18:48
As if the constitution is some kind of end all be all of justice and goodness and liberty. It fucking isn't, it really really isn't. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:28:07
Will you say the same if the BTC price rises back to $1000? No you wouldn't. I know you wouldn't. You know you wouldn't. Jesus christmas all righty knows you wouldn't.
Oh, you're a jealous troll who didn't get into Buttpaper when it was $.00000001 for 50,000 of them.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:26:21
Oh that's alright then, I could have never have found that kind of time 3 months ago.

You mean like Europeans and dyslexia... look at the paint on your own hands before you yell at the one whom your paint bucket landed on. Ol Grampa Bit taught me that 'un.

Prove they were stolen though.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:16:54
Though it does feel good to know other people missed out on a lot of money like I did. Could have had easily $30000 if I saved all my BTC when it was at it's peak in November.
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:19:40
I'll help your poor brain out, it must be so tired from looking at graphs all day like a wall street scrublord. $21M USD is not better than 30,000 BTC if those BTC were worth $1000 not $600.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:32:13
omg but he a crimainiallal who waz all bad and stuff

Thanks a lot for your wonderful hindsight. You're a really awful historian.
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:40:37
That depends, did you make 200000% gains?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:39:17
I'm never buying
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:55:52
Older than that probably.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:31:29
Then you wouldn't be on the Bitcoin subreddit... I don't go to the dogecoin subreddit because it's a stupid distraction.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:35:30
Are you implying we should never say anything bad about anyone ever because they will die or otherwise not be apart of our lives ever again? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:57:12
Is weed a halogen? Hey man I was there ya know. I had $20,000, but it was only really like $300-400 at the time. You lose some you lose some. I'm sure you had many occasions where you sold or bought at the wrong moment. Unfortunately for me not having any insurance and many mental disturbances I didn't just buy a bunch of (worthless, at the time) Bitcoin to sit on like an idiot.
The Bitcoin were used like Bitcoin is supposed to be used: as money. People like yourself are only interested in hoarding all you can to make big bucks doing jack shit. Good job furthering Bitcoin, really helpful. 
And I made a really good point. $21M USD is not greater than 30000 BTC if those BTC went back up to $1000 a piece. Which was the entirety of my comment. You just looked at the christmas stuff and decided to throw it all away, like $20,000 on weed.
Lol looking at your profile you must think you're some huge Bitcoin hotshot. For every idiot like you there's 10 more I bet. Wow my hashes are so fast today wow the coin is pouring in.
If it weren't for thousands of people using the darknet and Bitcoin when it was just $50 a piece I hardly doubt it would have continued growing and thriving. Once the whole SR1/BMR thing became widespread on the news Bitcoin really blew up. You have those people to thank for ur coinz.
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:56:36
Did you know Visa can process with only 0 confirmations? Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:37:25


Damn bro let me borrow that crystal ball you got.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:13:27


So they can make SR3.0 or just keep doing SR2 and just scam again later.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:16:15
Which in the past month, has been pretty much every day apparently. Fucking gox.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:50:33
That's like the "there are no snuff tapes" myth. Of course they exist. You just need enough money to find or have one made.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:21:52
So basically it just works off of stupid people actually wanting to buy Coxcoinz? Wow.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:26:18
I predict the price of Bitcoin will rise and will fall. I can't prove that though.

So what's the next best, if Kraken doesn't accept USD right now, Gox and Bitstamp are in some perpetual hell. Where does the small guy go right now? I have no idea.

Hey maybe stop cutting babies dick skin ya pedo and we'll stop talking about it. Wanna know how I know the Jews control this shit? I just need to look at my dick. I'm not Jewish, my parents aren't Jewish, I wasn't born in a Jewish hospital, I wasn't born in the holy land stolen from Palestinians yet my dick was mutilated as if I was born with a yamaka on my head and those stupid mutton chop sideburns.
We should cut the clits of baby girls! Let's normalize this genital mutilation 100% instead of 50%.     
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:08:19
just a casual $130 million~
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:35:48
The same idiots who had a kid without educating themselves on circumcision are the same idiots who'd pierce their babies ear.
What do genital mutilation and ear mutilation have in common? Neither should be done without consent. Now I don't know what you think but as far as I know children can't consent. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:57:25
Buy low sell high is the biggest misdirection in the modern world.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:33:06
That's good for people trying to use Bitcoin as currency, bad for people using Bitcoin like any run of the mill stock.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:24:03
Cars are only worth how much people value them. I value BTC over ferrari so now that means BTC should be at 1,000,000.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:47:16
Look at the dates on the address. Look up how much BTC was worth then. Now you know why.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:47:18


Hehe, yea, me either. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IT JUST DROPPED $10 NOOOOOO, hehe, yea, screw those price guys, YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES just went up $20!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:26:05
And when Bitcoin first came out I'm sure you were there saying "omg delusion, past figures dont indicate future performance blah blah blah".
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:08:02


How do you decide when it "succeeds"? Why wasn't breaking $1000 "succeeded"? Can Bitcoin "succeed" and then fail after?
What in the hell do you mean by succeed?

I can email my friend 100 bucks **for gas 100 miles from an atm** on a Sunday

Bitinstant is the percentage (like 1-2% or something).
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:50:52


Then maybe they should have had a backup. ;)
Those forensic-level services or any at all wouldn't exist if everyone backed up.

I've had a hiccup on an order and Charlie got it fixed for me. It's the only way I buy BTC.

How exactly does him killing himself equal less coins? His coins are still there you idiot. Do you even understand how Bitcoin works in the slightest.

This sounds like what a gambler would say. "Just gotta keep riding this machine, it'll pay out eventually. It just has to." It's the same thing as the first quote. It just isn't exaggerated to "tomorrow."

So youve barely known btc exist for a month yet you know it all.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:09:20
To answer that last question, to BTC farm (correctly) the price of BTC must rise. Or else you're BTC... corralling. To the moon or to the sun?
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:14:45
the first step is agreeing upon a price based on the current going rate of BTC, then doing the transaction like you said
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:43:26
Y u buy @ 900 on the 12th. Did you learn nothing from Dec 7th?
