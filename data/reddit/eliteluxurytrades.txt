Monetary supply inflation (as opposed to price level inflation) is always reflected in prices, but there are so many other variables that it might be hard to correlate the effect.

Not that it matters, but Roger never said this. He said he didn't sell all his BTC.

Even though it is possible, these daily interest schemes tend to involve counterparty risk which is part of what Bitcoin is trying to avoid, but why can't you lend your cash (physical or otherwise) for daily interest? I don't see any reason why that isn't possible.

I'm not sure.  To my knowledge that's the most popular tool.  Many coins do have block explorers of their own though.

If no one knows you hold Bitcoin cold storage done correctly is extremely safe.
Bitcoin transactions can't be censored and it is far harder for anyone to seize it in most cases.

This is correct.  It only shows the original balances.

It's probably one of the best counterparties crypto has to offer but nothing beats holding your own keys!

To be fair, a nano/trezor is also trusted hardware.  Downloading Bitcoin Core on a clean airgapped PC and creating addresses is probably safer.

I feel like you don't understand what a $5 wrench attack is. He's not actually going to hit you. He'll just make a threat to hit you and then you will tell him your password, he will unlock your flashdrive and steal your money.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:48:26
lol...that's not a high standard.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:49:49
No.  I'd reccomend using Coinbase and getting your LTC/ETH/BCH/BTC off as fast as possible and onto something that gives you more control.
We have no reason to think that other exchanges would be safer.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:21:03
True trade volume is underestimated due to OTC trading and overestimated due to wash trading so...it's complicated.

Do you think he lost his BTC in a boating accident?
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:49:28
 "self proclaimed CEO of binance" yeah what a joker :)

In other words, I'm not promising that we are going to be the new wealthy elite, gentlemen, but I am pretty confident.

Leverage and counterparties are both risky. If you want to make a conservative gamble, buy bitcoin on an exchange and then store it in a paper wallet with a backup. If you want to take on an aggressive gamble leverage with a trusted counterparty might be for you. 
I'm assuming that you're trading with a significant portion of your account. If we are talking about 10x leverage but you're only trading .0001% of your account. Then, no, that doesn't sound that risky.

You wont find any source. Adam Back wasn't involved with BTG. Luke also wasn't involved with bcash, he's been very loyal to Bitcoin.
I'm also not sure why he's referring to these forks as coin stealing scams, Garzik was the only prominent Bitcoiner that started a fork (UBTC) which stole a bunch of peoples coins.
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:18:18
The official wallet was stealing keys. True story.

0.012 isn't $20. That's the lesson.
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:16:30
It purposely comes without wrapping to prove that it is tamperproof, which has recently been debunked.  I would buy a trazor directly off trezor.io and then only use it for a hot wallet.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:33:26
Yes. This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:19:22
Haha did you just downvote me?
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:46:54
assuming you had some, sure.

Hey...stop privacy shaming!
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:43:58
We just needed a little break. 6 figure prices will come soon.  This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:59:48
Couldn't have said it any bolder than that.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:01:22
Wow. We're really growing fast :P
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:10:43
I think you nailed it. The value in ICOs may be that you can speculate on the quantity and quality of greater fools that will come in after you. 
Ethereum and other ICO "platforms" seem to have a real world value in creating arenas for these games.

Isn't that unredeemable by itself.  The cost to settle on the main net would be at least ~200 satoshis.

LN has grown from 12 BTC to 15 BTC...

There should be no such thing as criminal money. Money should be fungible.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:55:01
Yeah that's true, isn't it haha. It's 2 am where I live :) Please ignore my previous comments.

Bitcoin can replace currency conversion through atomic swaps. I suspect many types of investments can be handled by bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:43:33


This is not a great way to think about the boom/bust cycles, if this is your investment thesis I doubt you'll beat the market.
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:08:51
Margin trading is when you think you know the future. So, you leverage an already risky bet so that you'll get richer. You end up broke.
