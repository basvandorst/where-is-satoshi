Nope. Just this one. Same with my Blockchain. Adress is 100% correct, should be linked to me but apparently it "disconnected" somehow. Money is on it (transaction was confirmed) but it's not linked to me; I'm not even able to see that money in my wallet - and have no idea how to fix it up.

Updated the screenshot in thread, sorry.

No. Thats the weird thing, cause I received money through that adress to my Electrum. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:52:16
Yes, cause last time I had bought BTC I used this adress and it was delivered with no problem.

It is my adress - I mean it surely was. I used it to buy Bitcoin just last month, Dec 2 and haven't changed anything since then. As I mentioned, I didn't even have to type it at the market I get Bitcoin from 'cause it just remembered it. Blockchain proof is the photo that I put up, it's in my transaction history.

I purchased to 1L37m5WZbaKiTSWHNuE9Bi9TNaMWenxkDf ; I got it on Dec 2 clicking on "Receive" funds in my wallet - and it simply worked back then. I bought some Bitcoin off the market, put that adress &amp; received the funds with no problem. Now I logged into the same market, the adress was remembered by default so I didn't even bother changing it - and that was my mistake, cause my money is missing somehow, even though I didn't touch anything since the last purchase.
