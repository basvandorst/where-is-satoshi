Technically no, but since these connections are usually made on LBTC, it's incredibly misleading to say LBTC doesn't do many face to face trades.

Face-to-face transactions are a significantly bigger part of LBTC than "just 1.5% of total volume". A vast majority of these kind of transactions are never concluded on-website, which is why LBTC only has them recorded as "just 1.5% of total volume" - actually this is a surprisingly high percentage, all things considered. 
It would be much less misleading to say "Local, in-person (face-to-face) trading just 1.5% of total volume going through LocalBitcoins' escrow service".
As a former pro LBTC trader, I would say that face-to-face "LocalBitcoins trades" would probably account for a huge proportion of all bitcoin exchanges globally if you were to label all the activity from private trading relationships that were formed within or thanks to their website as such, although this is possibly unbeknownst to LBTC admins themselves.  
From my experience, making a serious name for yourself as a local LBTC trader will get a lot of high value individuals approaching you from seemingly nowhere, looking to make multi-million dollar trades. 
There really is a huge, crazy underground bitcoin movement out there, and it all goes through reputable LBTC traders. Make a big enough trust network for yourself as a discreet trader, and miners will want to sell to you on a regular basis; hackers will want to unload their bounties through you (both well under spot price); shady people involved in stuff you don't even want to imagine (literally, since if you do this well you will leave the trade knowing nothing at all about your customers - not even their first name) will summon you to fancy hotel rooms all around the country, pay for you to travel to Monaco to meet them in the back of a casino, and if you're clever enough, you will live to hear your hired security tell you to run the f away from a few potential kidnappings. Heck, you haven't lived until some random diplomat from a third world country invites you to their apartment above the embassy, buys $70k worth of bitcoin from you and invites you to have a go at one of their beautiful "assistants". 
If anything, that 1.5% must mostly be a front for traders that are even deeper down the rabbithole than I ever was to keep accounts with good standing and recent "verified" feedback.

What if I declare that I'm a government? Nobody else might recognise me as such but does that mean that I'm not one? The Montevideo convention seems to indicate that you don't need anyone's recognition in order to be a legitimate government. Just because nobody uses my currency and it has no value doesn't mean it's not a currency, just like that cryptocurrency that I've just forked off ethereum in my basement and that nobody has ever heard of is, technically, actually a cryptocurrency.

I don't know if I'm explaining this right but as I understand it, whenever they want or potentially never, it ultimately makes no difference for the average user whether they have "true" (on chain) ownership of their btc, and most likely future wallet UIs won't show a difference unless you enter some advanced user mode. Most people will have their coins on a LN node all the way from buying them on an exchange to fully spending them without having any knowledge that they are interacting with the LN or understanding that they can "settle" or what the implications of that are. All the necessary interactions can be most efficiently automated. 
Ofc we're a long way from that now, everything I've just said is assuming widespread adoption of LN.

This video was just attempting to explain the core mechanics of the concept by creating microscopic use case scenarios, what it failed to underline was that once LN is widely adopted, none of this will matter, the average Joe will be making lots of LN transactions everywhere without ever having to understand what is going on except that his transactions are fast and inexpensive. It will take a while for this level of integration to happen, but once it does, few will be the people who have any need to know that they even are using LN, much less how it actually works.

That or just sending it with a low fee and forgetting about it. It may take a stupid long time but it is going to move eventually, and when it does, you no longer will have a wallet with tons of small inputs. I'd say in all likelihood this will take less time than tx fees being fixed. If not, and for some reason you urgently need those coins at some point, you just pay the retardedly high tx fee with a cpfp tx or pay a miner to pass it through, whichever is cheaper. 
[This is less than ideal, but so was sending an email in 1984.]( Other cryptocurrencies or bitcoin forks may have found solutions that make them better than BTC, and if that is the case, we may eventually inspire ourselves on them to fix BTC. 
The development of BTC is slow and conservative compared to the overall blockchain space, but I'd say this is by design. It's no coincidence that investing in altcoins can be so much more profitable than just hodling BTC: They're also much riskier. The DAO and other security flaws are what happens with rapid innovation. 
It's not just about testing the technical aspects of new concepts and ideas for blockchain technology, it's also about testing the economic side of things. Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin and it will never be Bitcoin, but what it is, is a good way to measure market demand for bigger blocks. The price of BCH is a good indicator of this demand, and it will be extremely interesting to compare it pre and post LN. If the community really does want bigger blocks, there will eventually be a consensus within BTC to change the blocksize due to the threat of a growing BCH - we'd have the Bitcoin Cash community to thank for this, and assuming they exit quickly enough, those who bet on bigger blocks by buying BCH will make good money through this. But BCH will still not be Bitcoin, and there will be no reason for it to exist if BTC also adopts bigger blocks.
Altcoins may be the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is the real deal, and it will ultimately be the only truly relevant cryptocurrency as far as the world is concerned.

Bitcoin is not valuable because it is secure, that's the one flaw in this argument.
Bitcoin is secure. But that's not the reason it's valuable. 
Bitcoin is valuable because a lot of people think that it is valuable. That is the same reason why anything valuable has value. (subjective theory of value) 
It being secure might be one reason why people think its valuable, but it is definitely not the only reason.
A bubble occurs when the driving reason why a significant amount of people think something is valuable is because they can observe that other people think it is valuable. Now there's an actual example of circular logic. A correction is when people start to doubt the main reason why they think it is valuable, and an outright crash occurs when you were in a bubble and therefore the correction triggers a domino effect.
That's why it's so important to teach people about the things that we enthusiasts think make bitcoin valuable. The more information we put out there, the less likely we are to have bubbles.

First of all, why not? You mention "Destroy your own life?" as it were such a far-fetched, alien thing that no human being had ever done, or as if you know Craig Wright well enough to ascertain he wouldn't do such thing. Fact is, people do destroy their own lives all the time, for myriads of different reasons. People with personality disorders such as the ones Craig Wright appears to display are particularly at risk of doing this.
Not to mention that he might not even think of it as destroying his own life at all, either because he's delusional or because there is something else going on here (and lets face it, the potential possibilities and conspiracy theories are simply countless).

Are they a monopoly because they can intimidate effectively, or can they intimidate effectively because they are a monopoly? Chicken and egg question is really important to answer here because otherwise we're bound to miss the root of the problem. 
Doing whatever they want with their network isn't what's propping up their monopoly status. Stopping them from doing whatever they want with their network won't hurt their monopoly status. They have a monopoly status because of preferential treatment from the state, and their subsequent ability to manipulate legislation. You can't fix the problems caused by government intervention with more government intervention, no matter how good your intentions are. Only way to beat these telecom monopolies is deregulation and liberty.

Raised by a narcissist here, can confirm. Through all of his self-aggrandising, I can picture quite clearly what kind of mental spiral he went through, adding more and more "achievements" to his name over the years, each one slightly more unlikely than the last, until he had to go ahead and become Satoshi. 
The thing is, each of these achievements probably has a little bit of warped truth at its core. If my experience with my mother is any use though, he's a liar, but he's going to be a skilled one at that. They wouldn't lie about something extremely far-fetched or foreign to them. The lie doesn't only go outward, it also goes inward - if he can't believe it himself, he won't expect others to believe it either. 
My bet is he knows who Satoshi is. He's worked with him and now seeks to appropriate every single part of his work. It could very well be Kleiman, but even if it isn't, the real Satoshi is likely dead or at the very least unable/unwilling to communicate (even through his previous, anonymous means),  and Wright has knowledge of this. 
My worst fear about this story is that whatever has happened to Satoshi, or whatever he might be doing right now, might be a result of Wright's manipulation, blackmail, or other duress. If Wright thinks it's okay to become Satoshi, it's because he thinks he can now prove to the world that he's equal or superior to Satoshi - perhaps because he has "vanquished" him, literally or figuratively. 
That's all wild speculation, but as the poster above suggested, Craig Wright screams NPD and a lot of NPD behaviour is easily predictable to those who have lived around it.

If these kinds and levels of prepayment and/or delegation are such significantly more effective means of structuring a 'government agency', then private (voluntary) 'government agencies' that require customers to sign a contract (basically a voluntary constitution) allowing the agency to do these things will be that much more effective (and consequentially successful) than those that don't, meaning that this could become an industry standard.
I personally don't think this would be the case, actually, but if it was, I would be perfectly happy with that. One likely outcome of applying pure libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) principles is something that is sometimes referred to as '[Panarchy]( in essence, everyone would be free to choose whichever government agency they want, anyone would be free to start new competing government agencies but not many people would do so (most people don't start their own bakery or supermarket because they don't like their local ones), and choosing a government agency would be an objectively preferable option to not choosing one. 
Government agencies would thus service non-contiguous areas and would probably need to associate with each other in order to effectively defend themselves from outside threats (such as still existing monopoly States) - they would agree on a code of conduct for resolving conflicts and generally cooperate with each other on fairly large scales.
This is by definition a Libertarian society, and it's actually a fairly easily imaginable system we could transition to from the current one. Government excesses or ineffectiveness would be solved by simply changing 'providers', instead of moving to another country or voting. It's a known fact that competitive systems react, innovate and prosper a lot faster than monopoly systems, and there's a myriad of economic laws that explain this.

A restaurant that I set up to use bitpay 3 years ago just recently uninstalled it and deleted their account. Why? Because they decided they wanted to just take straight bitcoin. They regretted not having kept all the bitcoin they've accepted these past few years.
Just because bitcoin is not currently *money* doesn't mean it's not a *currency* (not the same thing) and it doesn't mean that it'll never be money. In a free market, money doesn't just spontaneously emerge overnight, it's a process. A process that you can clearly see bitcoin is currently on. Or did you assume that all forms of money throughout history have always been the result of State fiat?

I believe BTC will ultimately triumph over all other altcoins, including bitcoin cash. Principally because of the antifragile property of distributed, peer to peer, open source technology combined with having the largest network effect, along with the natural trends of free market money (See Hayek; The Denationalization of Money). There are and possibly always will be better cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin, but bitcoin will eventually absorb the best elements of all of them. That's my theory. 
Now that's out of the way, I can say that I'm glad the bitcoin cash hardfork happened and that they're using the branding that they are. Simply because it's not illegal: **nobody** owns or can ever own the "bitcoin" brand and therefore it ultimately had to happen that someone or a group of people would, intentionally or not, use the branding in a way that others, rightly or not, construe as deceptive, and it is better that it happen now, while we're still in the early days of Bitcoin (because bitcoin will last centuries, so these really are the early days). It will inevitably happen again, so we need to figure out how we deal with this non-violent "transgression" (if you view it as one) in  an equally non-violent (free market) way. This is our learning experience.
It's up to you to decide if vídeos like that in the OP are a step in the right direction.

The problem about taxes isn't what they're used for, per se. 
You see, even the most radical libertarian position isn't opposed to the existence of "governments" virtually identical to any of those that exist today, so long as hiring their services isn't an obligation enforced by the threat of force, just as with any other service organisation out there.
I think you might have been given a wrong impression about libertarianism based on the responses you've had so far here. In reality, the libertarian argument isn't "Should I be paying X in order for the government to do Y?" - libertarian economic and political theory isn't really concerned with what X and Y even are; the question that libertarians (or at least, anarcho-capitalists, a specific radical subset of libertarianism that takes libertarian philosophy to its logical conclusions) are really asking is "Should I be **forced** to pay X in order for the government to do Y?". 
No other organisation would be tolerated this behaviour. Can you imagine if the milkman came to your home every morning, delivered milk to you and demanded payment, although you never asked for this milk and do not want it? At this point, it doesn't matter what the price of the milk is, or the quality of it (X and Y respectively), the problem is that this madman is not giving you a choice to begin with! 
The mainstream response to this argument is that some industries are different. Governance, security/defence, justice and education are the industries that are always cited in even the most conservative, "free-market" countries, but depending on how widespread left-wing views are in any given country, there are usually going to be a great deal many more industries added to the list, where pure communism would actually include virtually each one. 
There are several justifications for why they are different, and I'm not going to elaborate on any of them or the libertarian counterarguments, because otherwise this post is going to be way too long and this isn't what I'm trying to get at here. 
What I would like to say, however, in response to your statements about the syrian refugees, is that although not every libertarian would agree with you (because a lot of libertarians have conservative  or right-wing influences), your position isn't strictly un(or anti)libertarian. In fact, I am certain that had they elected a truly libertarian government, the people of The Netherlands would still have reacted compassionately to the horrible situation in Syria and welcomed many refugees (perhaps more, perhaps less, there's no way to make predictions either way). These operations would have been privately funded, though, which only means that everyone that contributed to it would have done so out of choice.
Furthermore, precisely because these kind of endeavours would be privately funded, and since they would presumably compete against other charitable endeavours for their funding, There's actually a quite good chance that they would be carried out much more effectively. If a church, for instance, brought over and housed violent criminals or dangerous extremists, you can pretty much guarantee that the church's benefactors would be quite unhappy and threaten to stop funding it.
