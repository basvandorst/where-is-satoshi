How much did coinbase make in transfer fees?

Nah, I'm just asking for some speculative opinions about the near future for the price of bitcoin. I'm not asking for anyone to hold my hand in making this decision, I'm merely asking for some opinions on the matter of selling now or waiting for a possible price increase instead.

I think people who were previously not involved noticed that it had breached the 10k psychological barrier and decided to buy some, driving demand up. Once it surpassed 10k, perhaps there was no longer a "ceiling" for the price of a bitcoin. 
I also think bitcoin is becoming more recognized in the mainstream instead of being a sort of underground project. To some of us, bitcoin might be in our daily reading and news, but you'd be surprised how many folks still wouldn't know what bitcoin is if you asked them.
The price of BTC is always due for a pullback or correction when it rises so quickly as it recently did, although I think it will continue to rise in the long run. After bitcoin becomes widely used for transactions is when I expect the volatility to fizzle out.
Even though bitcoin is almost 10 years old, I would still argue it's in the pioneer/infancy phase and has a lot of growing to do until it reaches its' full potential. With a finite limit of 21 million bitcoin, I think having a full bitcoin could mean you're a very wealthy individual in 10 years, given the population is in the billions and a very small percentage of that can have a whole bitcoin.

I believe that would be a Stop order, not a Limit order.

So crypto currency removes the central power that is the bank, but it doesn't do away with transaction fees?

Thought about this too. This problem would also scale with time - what if in 70 years when millennials start dying, we forget to put our private keys in our will and the bitcoin we had is lost forever?

yeah, a hot dog was ~5 cents then and is nearly 5 dollars now.
