I can't imagine someone valuing a chain that was impossible to upgrade.  It's just going to lag behind in features/improvements that way.

How can that lead to problems?
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:56:21
That's only one small example -- others have hard forked explicitly to upgrade the network, and it's better than letting nodes stagnate with old code.

Haven't hard forks worked perfectly fine in other chains for years now?

Ethereum has more running nodes than bitcoin, and it still has hard forked several times.  Just not sure why you're saying a hard fork can't work.

There are plans to automatically scale blocksize in proportion to a simple moving average, similar to the DAA that already exists.  But that's only intermediate scaling plans.

I'm not sure anymore, 
This paints a slightly different picture.

Yeah but there are now dozens of others that have the same concept while functioning better.  So for anybody who's entering the space now, what value would they get in adopting the old permanently-hindered chain?

You must not have been around long, but many of us were transacting with bitcoin for the last 8 years because it was better than using banks or cash.  Unfortunately that utility is long gone.

Doesn't that only apply temporarily?  Mining difficulty adjusts over time to match the network hashrate, at which point it'll cross profitability again.  I guess the question is how badly does it damage block production in between those adjustment windows.

Some guy on reddit telling me it's a novelty after I've used it near weekly for many years... sure thing buddy.  You do you.

The source is literally his tweet that he wrote himself.

Some people (even Charlie Lee himself) believe a long bear market is coming... so there's speculation of prices around that level as a possibility.
