of course an evangelical christian or JW would  be enthusiastic about sharing what they think is truth... the big difference is that their delusional and people who are excited about science and tech aren't. and that's why the jebus crap should be left out of science and tech talk.

oh no how dare someone be enthusiastic about something they see that actually has potential in society. comparing jw's with bitcoin advocates is a truly hilarious to me... lol you never go full retard man. if you can't see the potential in bitcoin and crypto currencies your not looking hard enough or in the wrong places.

lol OK there... none will succeed eh?  I bet you said that about email/the internet or when plastic cards replaced paper checks, or electricity replacing candles in every home...  etc. 
yes many will fail... but some will become staples in the future of global economy. let the coin wars begin :)

people use words like "could potentially be worth... by such and such date" and it's like all people hear is WILL BE WORTH.
so it's having a little dip... not a big deal unless you were stupid enough to put everything you have in to it expecting to jump over night. if anything it's a great time to buy some.
