Just pm your email address to me ;-)

It would be nice if they considered Google Authenticator too, that way you wouldn't need to buy a physical device.

If you can still get to your email, there is an option to disable the yubikey. Otherwise I imagine you would have to prove your identity to lastpass in some other way.

There's an android application that will display your card given the seed

The yubikey can store two identities, so a single key could only be used for two systems. I intend to only use it for my lastpass login. Lastpass supports a challenge-respons authentication against the yubikey. You could also use it for sites that doesn't support it directly by configuring it to store a static password. The key appears to the computer as a normal usb keyboard, and when you press the button it enters the password as if you had typed it.

If you're in Europe, the Euro transfer option on mtgox is a lot easier than trying to get dollars on there.

One sent, still got more.

Don't know how long it's gonna last, but I've still got invites ;-)

Used DareC's, mine is:

Went down to 14.35, now at 14.37. Another Mt. Gox bug? 
@_date: 2011-06-25 08:28:10
Works for me. Remember to use the new password. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 17:20:21
sent, enjoy :-)

The drop was from 15.50 to 14.35 
@_date: 2011-06-27 08:15:01
yeah, good point. My thinking was that 16 should be more than enough to
be uncrackable, and it's manageable for the rare occasion where i need to type it in manually 
@_date: 2011-06-23 15:29:13
Well yes, that is a worry. But with lastpass your passwords are always encrypted locally before they are sent to the server, so even with a break in you should be reasonably safe given a strong enough master password.

If you pm me your email, I'll send you one

Me too, I have a transaction (from blockchain.info to satoshidice), with 0 confirmations after 3.5 hours...

Well, knowing that there are wallets with coins to be robbed, doesn't actually make it any easier. All brain wallets that exists can be robbed if the seed can be guessed, but the guessing isn't targeted to particular brain wallets. Any guess targets all brain wallets in existence! Which is why you brain wallet seed has to be a lot more secure than any normal password or passphrase.
