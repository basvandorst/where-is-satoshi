Just glad he finally has a hobby taking up his time tbh.  He never was a bright boy.

So you're saying all gold is worth more than 1 bitcoin.  Thanks for the analysis.

Like others here are stating, use GDAX.  You were advised on this 17 days ago from the top reply:

Musk married and divorced the SAME woman twice.  I am choosing to believe Satoshi had a little better foresight.

I believe you meant to say "tractorable".  And I agree.

Interesting to note the delta between BTC &amp; ETH "market cap" is currently wider (~ $9B ) than in this screenshot.

Good on BashCo for taking the high road here.  Very clear winner.  SoCo_cpp comes in a VERY distant second place.  Better luck next time SoCo.

Completely agree.  The onus is on the individual to reach out to the company first.  If u/chillip135 has exhausted all efforts to reach Coinbase and feels the need to reach out to the community afterward then at least provide documentation to support the claim.  Without proof it smells of a smear campaign against Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:35:50
I believe in innocence until proven guilty (I do not mean Coinbase is 100% innocent of everything for all time - just maybe in this situation).  I realize Coinbase has made mistakes in the past (and probably will again in the future).  Coinbase may very well be at fault in this matter for all I know.  I just believe the individual should prove the issue instead of making claims that may be true but also could be completely fabricated.  
Someone could make a claim that you stole $10M from the US Govt yesterday.  Wouldn't you prefer that proof was required prior to action by the US Govt against you?
