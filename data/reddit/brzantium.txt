"long time sick-leave"
In the US, we'd call it long term disability or even just disability.  Glad to hear things managed to work out for you this month.

You want mining co-ops.

This.  Right now there's still a good chunk of complexity on the front end that confuses and/or discourages the average Joe.  My wife is someone who's very intrigued by new technologies, but never wants to take more than ten seconds figuring it out, and I feel that's a widely shared sentiment that needs to be served before mass adoption.

Back in college, I had a roommate that just bought and sold 4 and 5 character domains.  He had a few other things going on, but that's how he paid the rent...on time.

Same here.  I always buy on pay day which seems to always happen right before a weekend dip.  Not this time, I thought - I'm gonna get that weekend dip.  Check price bright and early Saturday morning...$8600...balls.

Ugh, I remember 4 years ago thinking, "huh, maybe I should really look into this whole Bitcoin thing...".  Five minutes later my wife quit her job to go back to school.  Investing $2k then would've paid off the debt she's accumulated since.  Hindsight's a motherfucker.

This.  I recently got in after sitting on the sideline for years, too.  I was originally buying a little bit of BTC, ETH, and LTC every couple weeks.  I got tired of being able to buy less and less everytime, so I just threw it all in.  And then two days later was all the China FUD, and the dip I was tired of missing.  But I had exhausted all my fun money, and won't have more until November.  ETH seemed to be declining the fastest so I exchanged all of it for some promising altcoins, didn't pay attention to fees.  Now, even though my altcoins are ok, and BTC is at a new ATH, I'm still at a loss.  I've been kicking myself for weeks because I chose FOMO over hodl.
