What makes you say that

So-called “technical analysis” is pseudoscience. This goes for stocks as well. You cannot time markets and you cannot predict future performance based on magic shapes on a chart. 
It doesn’t work, period.

If enough people think the past accurately predicts the future, it will. The only way to make a market predictable is to convince everyone who has an opinion/stake in it of the same opinion, whatever that may be. The very fact that you are arguing this point with someone with a different opinion than you is in a sense contributing to unpredictability.

Not a good one? It's a melodramatic, loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet with lots of eye candy. The plot gets stupid and it is often over the top, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. I was entertained though

I didn't like the second half, but the first half is great.
