Oh yes, ValueShuffle is the third solution. A bit unfortunate, that it's interactive and opt-in, but I guess it can probably be solved by widespread wallet support.

Bitcoin with CT is still traceable. You will need to add either ring signatures, zero knowledge protocols or some yet-to-be-discovered technology to make bitcoin private again.

While I tend to believe that there is a "rational" explanation of Jihan's behavior, which doesn't invoke any "conspiracy" argument, him being based in overtly authoritarian China is troubling. I'm not sure that one can safely exclude the possibility of Chinese government covertly influencing Jihan now or/and in the future, especially taking into account highly diruptive nature of bitcoin and the threat it creates for fiat currencies of central banks.

Stayed relatively "secret" for more than 40 years. Not all "conspiracy theories" are lame, unfortunately.
Also, huge amount of activity done by CIA and other special services can be pretty much described as... conspiracy, which tends to stay "secret" for a rather long time.
See  for example.
You can also try researching the origin of "conspiracy theory" meme yourself, here's a good starting point: 
P.S. I don't believe in Core conspiring to DoS BU nodes :)

ZCash, another privacy-oriented crypto, is a company's product, dude. Monero is a community driven coin, just like BTC.
