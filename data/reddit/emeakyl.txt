it was a really great day, and I also want to say that the volunteer staff is awesome! Thanks for the expo!
at the beginning of the day it was said that there were around 1000 registered visitors to the expo.
I was a bit surprised that vault of satoshi doesn t have a booth or even sponsorize the event... there is surely a reason for this but I was busy when I saw them in the hall. In comparison cavirtex looked damn efficient and professionnal.
I found the panels I attended (law &amp; regulation, the future of bitcoin and Entrepreurship) very interesting and I also share the view ThePiachu exposed. "What does bitcoin offer to women?" remembered us that bitcoin can have a direct and positive impact on the life of people in very difficult situations.
The booths looked pretty busy in the afternoon (I was among them shortly, I was in the conferences). Each kind of bitcoiners (miners, traders, ...) has several booths where they can find relevant stuff for them.
I took ~90 pics with my camera today; I will try to upload some of them tomorrow morning (but that s a bit difficult with my smartphone...).
can't wait for tomorrow!

I second this one... it's difficult to guess first that the "sentences" are words extracted from a larger sentence. And I got one dealing with latin names of some moth species... A bit harsh :)
A small explanation about how to play would be great also (without coins, I thought first that I have to write a formated answer in the shout box on the right).
Except that, it seems to work well here (Firefox 27.0.1 windows 7 64 bits).
Just to be sure: I used all my coins (-0.003) in order to guess a sentence, that in the end I guessed (+0.005). 
A the current time, nothing has happened - my satoshicode.com account is empty, and it doesn't seem to have a transfer to my bitcoin wallet. I assumed that it is part of the test, but just in case I report this.

So it means that if I wanted to play again, I have to send my coins again? It's a bit time consuming and counter-intuitive...
I would have assumed that my gains are added to my account, and that the account amount can be sent back to me on demand...
This way I can play more often and streamingly.
At least there should be a message somewhere saying that my gains are sent to my address. (maybe there is? I haven't spot it)

The same happened to me with la caisse d épargne and kraken...

I am using it, yes. what do you want to know?
the order book is nice and clear, I like it... and is very addictive.


I also registered to canadianbitcoins.com and this is the same. As I understand, it is mandatory by law... so I don't find that especially suspect. Maybe I am wrong?

it's very tedious to buy from them. 
You validate your order, then you make a bank transfert to them and thus they are waiting for your money to arrive and _then_ they give you your bitcoins at the current rate... 
Because bank transferts take a few days to arrive, you can imagine how frustrating it is...
Since a few days, you can make an order, they keep your money and you decide when you want to buy with the amount you specified.. However, as far as I know, I can't change the amount of the order.
However, as I said, it uses bank transfert in CAD.. so at least you don't have to give money to the bank system for the currency change. and that's true that their price is lower than the ones on VoS.
