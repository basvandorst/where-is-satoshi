823 bits for a buffet plate? What do you mean? People say 823 dollars, 823 pounds, 823 yen. Does it matter?
[There was a discussion about this]( 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:35:47
I would think they have their own units. Litecoin = lites, Ethereum = ether. Not sure the exact unit terms but that’s the idea. Bits will always relate to Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:58:02
Preach it bruh!!

Same as yours 3k limit haha! Not sure if there’s a way to increase further. But I started 2 years ago and did dollar cost averaging. I think that’s the best way to ride the volatility bro. Just buy like $100 / $1000 per week/month or buy each time there’s a dip. Hold them long term.
Find out the max amount you can buy to make full use of coinbase’s fee per transaction so it’s worth it. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:23
How is it overloaded? British “Pound” for currency and Imperial system “pound” for weight. It’s not a big issue. Just adapt.

You can buy even a $1 from someone if you want. Most exchanges will have a minimum purchase. Take note of the fees to make the transfer worthwhile.
Remember, you can buy a fraction of any cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:08:52
Ok probably 10 minutes is too fast. How about every 24hrs? The price per coin changes daily from what I see, some days by a few hundreds.
I think it all boils down to how fast you want your money to work for you. DCA works best if there are constant ups and downs. And there are ups and downs daily! Same if you buy weekly, only that it is slower putting your money in the market.
I’ve been buying daily, and I see no difference in buying weekly imho �� I do see gains than buying with a lump sum.

If the app itself crashes or you can’t do a specific task within the app or the UI/UX sucks, then by all means leave a review relating to the app. If it’s because API/database crash give feedback at the appropriate channels (like email or Reddit).
Leaving bad  or 1 star reviews (for a company that made crypto adoption easier) ain’t going to make things better. Be thankful that they’re around in the first place. Every company has its growing pains, just be patient.

Pound = weight, currency, an action
There are English words that are used repeatedly for different context. So I don’t get your point?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:08:37
You’re overthinking bluethunder... There are a lot of words out there with multiple meanings. Just think of “bits” as a word and not binary. “Bit” deriving from the word “Bitcoin”.

Anything digital, it can be programmed (easily) to favour the house. I don’t understand why ppl are playing such games?
If it’s something analog (and secure from tampering) like lotto number balls sucked up by a vacuum or dropped from a spinning wheel I’ll be more inclined to play cos it’s purely based on luck.

I’ve got the feeling that what they’re doing is just a honey-glazed ponzi scheme.. but the later you get in the riskier it is. There’s Bitpetite and they’re new so it’s less riskier?

Oh in that case, (if you’re still young) go ahead ;) Make sure to do your research. Dollar Cost Average if you’re not confident. Buy every few days or weekly.

I would love to not pay taxes but we all have to contribute to nation-building somehow (better infrastructure etc). Some form of tax is good but sadly we have no idea where our money goes or spent at.
What I would like to see for the future is that we pay taxes in crypto. With everything on the blockchain, government spending is more transparent.
