Well, the way I see it, as long as I'm not trading more than I'm willing to lose that's a bit of a nonissue. I haven't invested any fiat money yet - all of it has been dogecoin traded to other currencies so far. I only plan to trade a third of my overall balance at any given time, so even if I lose *everything* it won't be a big deal. I'd just like to learn, and see if maybe I can't make my money make money at the same time! I appreciate the cautionary advice, however! :)
EDIT: *mined dogecoin traded to other currencies. Not just magical dogecoin that appeared in my wallet from out of nowhere.

Will do, thanks!

Cryptsy and btc-e seem to be the winners so far! I'll definitely be setting up a couple accounts when I get home. Thanks!
Also, I have my wallets stored on a desktop that is unplugged from the internet 99% of the time (I plug it back in to sync it up once a week), with the encrypted .dat files backed up in encrypted zip files to an encrypted usb thumb drive (I can be a little paranoid). I'm not sure if that's what you meant by cold storage, but that's what I have going for me so far. :)

That said, I appreciate your concern and words of warning. :)

From what I've seen (just signed up for Cryptsy and BTCe), exchanges don't ask for that much personal information unless you're planning on exchanging crypto for fiat currency. That really doesn't interest me right now. I'd be more interested in making a little extra money on an exchange and funneling the bitcoin/dogecoin back into the community (via Etsy to get cool art, for example). I also enjoy accepting crypto through my own Etsy shop. :)

Any extra secure distros you'd recommend? My experience with Linux is about as limited as my experience with crypto-currency, lol.

Thanks for the advice! Any suggestions on reading material to make it a little less like slot machines? I assume I'll eventually have to start reading books on forex trading strategies, trend analysis, Bellman-Ford graph searches, etc., but I really have no idea where to start.
I'm not concerned with losing the money, as it's all mined with only a couple of hours of set-up time on my part. :)

An etrade account is more than I'm willing to invest right now (at least of the money I'm funneling into paying off my student loans). That will probably change once I'm debt free, but not before.
I'm a firm believer in learning by doing, so it's really just the process I'm interested in at the moment. Once I get comfortable with the process of trading cryptocurrency I'll probably get more serious with it. I have a fairly significant amount of experience in Python scripting, so scripted algorithmic investing is not out of the realm of possibility (...eventually).

Thanks! It looks like they both have pretty well-documented APIs as well, so I'd eventually be able to try my hand at some python-scripted algorithmic trading.
