How long does a crash normally take to bottom out and be called a crash? I'm new to this whole thing, and debating waiting for the crash to buy

Ah. Just a catchy typo then?

I think I might just set up a second bank account to throw in a set amount per week as well as a small initial investment while I watch and see where this goes. More reading to do

Every time I see something from this sub lately I hate myself for not investing the last time I saw it. Tonight's the night I learn about bitcoin

Don't think I'm going to buy in after some research. With the small amount I was thinking of starting with, any profit would be eaten by fees, which are horrid for Canadians from anywhere I've found to buy. Also, the market trend looks good for now, but far too volatile for me

Thanks, I'll check it out

Unfortunately I'm in Canada, which seems to make the whole thing a giant pain in the ass. I was looking into Eth as well, looks promising. But I'll have to research more when I have more time. All the Canada specific exchanges look sketch as fuck

Which doc is that?

In the early days, a guy paid 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza. Can't remember what they were worth then, but 100 million now 
 
Edit: ok, I get it, it was the first Bitcoin to product transaction, 10000 BTC was worth two pizzas, yadda yadda. Shut up already

Oh, shit. I thought it had an established price then. Thanks, that makes it even cooler
