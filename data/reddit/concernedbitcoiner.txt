Stay away from bitstamp. Run by 2 scumbags from a shithole in europe who hold your money hostage until you answer extremely intrusive questions.
An Mt.Gox in the making.

Why don't these people just do something productive. We've fed them, clothed them, given them shelter. Now they get flooded from building a cesspool in a flood zone, and the cycle repeats itself.
Andreas is pathetic.

Robocoin is the biggest joke in the bitcoin space.

At least I don't result to personal insults. Bitcoin economics have already failed numerous times in the past, ie Gold. Bitcoin is a brilliant technical achievement but on an economic level it is nothing more then the rehash of old errors. Similar to the internet, which promised a utopia but delivered a cesspool instead. You can't solve moral, philosophical, theological problems with python code.

My source is the reality of the last 5 years. The only concern has been how to get more fiat to flow into bitcoin and at faster rates.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:48:53
100% BTC based economy would completely strangle the system. You would have massive poverty amongst the vast majority of participants, while wealthy holders engage in usury and live like gods.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:47:59
So you are perfectly happy with an economic system where 0.001% engage in usury and hoarding, while the rest work for them in misery? Yep, sounds like progress to me.

Where am I advocating persistent inflation? I said I do not want this to turn into a fiat vs BTC argument. I am NOT supporting state sponsored debt instruments as money. A bitcoin system does not reward those who create surplus value, it transfers surplus value to bitcoin hoarders and lenders. It is a zero sum game, the wealth producer gets short changed.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:39:15
The current system is just as bad I agree, but bitcoin is just a rehash of the 19th century, which gave birth to the disastrous 20th century.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:36:51
Rothbard wanted his gold shekels to swell in value. Capitalism as it is practiced is state sponsored usury.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:44:03
Large holders do not have to do anything. They just watch as everyone else labors away producing goods and services, they then are able to capture this new wealth via declining prices against their bitcoin hoards. Do you understand this concept? Those with BTC sit idling around getting rich, while those without it are forced to labor for persistently declining pay. "deflation" is a wealth transfer mechanism to those with large bitcoin stash's. The wealth being transferred comes from those producing it. They will also need to "borrow" BTC's further impoverishing themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:55:46
Where would those bitcoins come from exactly? They would be difficult to get, and you would be getting paid perpetually less. The surplus value your labor creates would be transferred to LARGE hoarders, who would be happy to relend it back to you at interest. You would see your debts rise while your wages fell.
Im sure Roger Ver would be happy to hire you to wash his cars and sweep the floors of his house as repayment.
Bitcoin is no different then gold. The vast majority under the gold standard were impoverished, while gold lenders reaped vast riches.
Look at the bitcoin "ecosystem" now, what are early adopters doing besides providing gambling sites, lending services and "exchanges". That's right nothing. Oh yea, besides the clever speeches.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:37:45
I never said BTC is a scam, its simply a rehash of failed monetary systems. The 100% gold standard. It impoverishes the vast majority while enriching those with gold to lend.

Bullshit. Every anti virtex post is followed by comments pumping vault of satoshi. Cavirtex has the fastest no bs payouts out of any exchange, they are also the oldest btc exchange still in operation. Your post is fud. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:41:20
Do you understand with perpetual deflation those who have to sell their labor ie 99% of the people see their wages head downwards. They then are forced to borrow from those who have gold/btc. This leads to further impoverishment. A 100% bitcoin standard would see the VAST majority who are forced to work for a living see their living standards collapse, as bitcoin hoarders enjoy the wealth they create. The purchasing power created via labor is transferred to those who hold sterile computer digits. This was the same case under gold.

Investing in bitcoin = handing over money to miners who conjure BTC out of air.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:03:24
Fiat money encourages hoarding. People will spend fiat before they spend btc or gold.
Quantity theory of money is completely wrong. Money behaves in a fractal fashion not in linear. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:19:34
Why does every discussion have to retort to fiat vs BTC comparisons. Do you have an inferiority complex? I am NOT arguing the merits of state fiat. Both systems are rooted in usury and theft. One of the consequences of 19th century capitalism which bitcoin is rooted in, has been the nation state.
Bitcoiners advocate theories that have created the very monster they now oppose. Circular reasoning.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:38:15
Yes well duh. Of course they have an incentive to see through that their personal holdings continue to swell in value.
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:57:40
This is the biggest development in bitcoin since the original implementation.

Bitcoin is counter revolution. It restores money back into the hands of individuals.
The nation state's control of money was revolutionary. Revolutions seldom bring about a better state of affairs then they replace.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:45:22
Money can be anything that extinguishes debt. Who can extinguish debt? Only PRODUCERS. Bitcoin based monetary system would see producers of wealth impoverished as bitcoin holders gain the purchasing power the producers create. Do you not understand this simple concept? Wealth producers would be forced to "borrow" from bitcoin lenders, at interest rates that would rise in real terms since the price of their goods/services would fall. This would continue to enrich about 0.001% of the participants.
Persistent deflation is a byproduct of capital destruction, not an artificially induced state ie fake scarcity. Capital is scarce only to the extent it is not being prudently utilized to create more capital, not by what a bitcoin miner can "mine" or how much gold is in the ground.

P2P is not a revolution, its how people always interacted. The 19th century brought about the nation state via revolution.
