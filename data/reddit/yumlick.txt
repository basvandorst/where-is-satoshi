Back when I started years ago people would troll the community here and bitcointalk and we literally had nothing but faith to defend our position.  Now you’ve got endless commits, years of price history, millions being poured into development and derivatives and so much more to point to and back up your decision.  Bitcoin has been tested many times over the years and it just keeps getting stronger.  It’s this knowledge and having lived through it that makes this a walk in the park.

The exploit was fixed by the devs and found to not have been used.  If it had been used the dev team could have forked.  One of the things about the project is how good/responsive the dev team is.

.6 after 2022 is basically a hard cap and incentivizes miners without having to restrict the block size.  2nd layer solutions like LN can be built on monero too and there won’t be drama about accommodating them on the block chain.  Monero is more future proof in that respect.
@_date: 2018-09-01 07:34:11
Why would financial institutions operate in the clear like that?  They don’t do that now and gain nothing from it.  The last thing they want is competition seeing their books or regulators watching them in real time.  It makes more sense that they would use a blockchain that is private that allows them to be as transparent as they want to be and no more.
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:12:27
You should really look into the emission curve.  Saying it doesn’t have a hard cap while technically true doesn’t tell the whole story.

You said the currency inflated for other reasons. But money printing definitely contributed to it.  That’s all I’m saying.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:42:45
But they worked for the money they used to buy bitcoin.  And they assumed risk by buying bitcoin.  So they worked for the potential and if it works out in the future, they earned it.  
Your logic sucks.
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:08:14
Because nobody uses it.  The whole reason they are stress testing is because they don’t have people using it and stressing it through adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:28:58
Monero fiat price has declined less than bitcoins in terms of percentage.  I do not measure moneros value in bitcoins.  I measure it in dollars because all of my bills are paid using dollars.  So your argument that it is a worse store of value than BTC is bunk.

@_date: 2018-05-22 04:32:40
An increase wasn’t needed.  Increasing the block size wouldn’t encourage better utilization of the current space and segwit itself allowed more transactions in the same space so it effectively was an increase without impacting decentralization.

@_date: 2018-10-08 18:28:04
We can only assume his motivations but the most logical assumption is that he had a number of nodes/miners in mind that he felt was enough to ensure the survival of the network without his participation and he mined until that number was met.
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:13:18
That’s not really true.  People discuss their position in a particular stock or investment all the time as a way to validate their opinion.  People new to crypto don’t realize that it’s actually spendable like money and are treating it solely like an investment where it’s typical to ask those sort of questions.

“Well known” common dude, siding with the evidence instead of conspiracy is the rational approach.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:49:44
Some of the hits were in response to one of his admins being set up for theft by the feds.  Ross was convinced they tried to steal from him and he wanted to make an example.  In the end he didn’t succeed in killing anyone and he’s had plenty of time to reflect.  I feel he’s a good candidate for rehabilitation.  But at the same time he could fall in with bad people that idolize what he did and this could make it very difficult for him to rehabilitate.  I hope we get to find out.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:37:16
That is not true, there was evidence presented at his trial.  There was his diary, his chat logs where he discussed it with VJ and the bitcoin and wire transactions he used to pay for the hits which corroborated the conversations.  Your reply is 100% a lie.

Given everything we know now the sentence does appear unjust.  But he wasn’t sentenced based on the murder for hire charges.  According to the prosecution, the murder for hire evidence was introduced to show how far he was willing to go to protect his empire, it wasn’t a charge considered during sentencing.  I recall there were several laws he wasn’t charged with when I was reviewing it.  Let’s hope he gets a second chance, I really doubt he would make the same decisions after everything he’s been through.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:06:23
The corrupt agents worked on a different team than the ones who found and arrested him.  I’ve known several FBI agents through family and I believe most are good and not corrupt.  There are often multiple offices working the same case independent of one another.  The evidence of his laptop was handled correctly by that team and it was discussed at length in the trial.  In fact the defense tried very hard to drag the corrupt agents into the case to help create doubt but the judge didn’t allow it.  There’s a legal term for that I am forgetting.
The BTC was proven to come from Ulbricht’s wallet and the wallet was corroborated several ways from what I remember.  They also linked a wire transfer payment for the hits to him.
There’s several plausible reasons for not pursuing the case including that they don’t have a good case.  
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:30:37
The government doesn’t allege that Ross was The one and only DPR.  They proved it in a court of law.  Ross took a cut of each sale and built the platform so he was trafficking.  He could have been altruistic and done it differently but he didn’t.

There were two corrupt agents working independently.  One FBI and one SS.  They were not a part of the office/team that found and arrested Ross.  I’m starting to think people are purposely omitting this info in order to make Ross look better but it isn’t serving his best interests.  It just causes division.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:07:10
I wrote a paper on this case so I am familiar with it.  The corrupt agents were not on the team or even working in the same office as the team that found and arrested him.  The judge made the right call in not allowing it because there was no evidence they coordinated in any way.
I started writing that paper with the intent to show it as a miscarriage of justice and ended up humbled by my own ignorance.  I learned a lot about how I consumed information and formed beliefs and am now a better person because of it.
