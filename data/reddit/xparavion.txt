I don’t believe a lack of foresight on the governments end should make the public suffer. 
I’m very libertarian in many ways, but I don’t think Uncle Sam should be making decisions to harm the public to continue the globalist control nonsense that exists today, and trying to increase with each passing minute. 
Crypto represents a real possible re distribution of wealth and that TERRIFIES the status quo.

Real traders don't use gdax. 
Gemini is a legitimate alternative onramp/offramp competitor to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:52
Binance fee structure is about the lowest imaginable. What are you smoking?

Suggestion for better subs? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:50:07
Get your money out of coinbase as soon as possible. Move it on to Gdax (aka coinbase's exchange) and then anywhere else. Hard ware wallet preferably. That will allow you to avoid coinbase's heavy fees. 
If you're looking for a cb alternative? Head over to  and start up an account with them. It will take a few days so the sooner the better. I recently made the choice to leave cb as well.

Buy and hold something like btc for a little bit. You’re gonna get eaten alive trading that low. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:53:37
This is precisely why the us senate is pursuing moves to criminalize non disclosure of bitcoin holding under aml laws. 
Complete bullshit to try to hold onto their power. At the end of the day it won’t stop btc.

In a fear years time, there will be entire careers dedicated to assisting you in this. 
If you’re in this for the long haul, don’t worry about taxation just yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:43:11
Indeed. But that’s total volume, not a targeted segment. 12 million direct viewers is much greater than 32 of npr spread out among all shows of theirs

Resistance now is just north of ~7100. Be patient and wait for the drop. 
I would probably recc getting in soon. I think we'll be shooting up the ladder rungs very soon.

@_date: 2017-11-19 03:59:09
The most real advice is, if you have to ask an online anonymous source about financial advice that is so specific that your livelihood could be decimated, you shouldn't be in this game just yet. 
Now starting small? Say a hundred bucks isn't the worst idea. It'll get you into the game, and paying attention more since you're invested in it. You'll learn the ins and outs much faster. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:18:19
I’m fairly bullish that we see an ATH today, with roughly 10 by year end. 
In other words, I agree. 
Gosh I feel bad for the bcash bag holders. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:17:36
It’s all just noise from bag holders from the pump n dump. They really want to believe they weren’t used and abused. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:12:37
What is a Canadian dollar?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:52:34
I’d consider my advice to have been pretty solid at this point. 
Shortly after I said that, there were two entry points around 7100. 
Hitting 8k today was a 12.7% jump. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:27:36
Absolutely pathetic. So many appear super mad and sad about getting totally screwed on the pump scheme. Whether they bought too high or held too long, these guys are furious.
Misdirected anger doesn’t help though. 
Don’t get caught in an obvious pump scheme, especially one that attacks internally; as it weakens all of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:14:37
No worries mate. The bch bag boys are angry doen voters lately! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:30:11
Part two of advice: stop shady attacks on BTC bc you invested in bch when it was 2400. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:12:01

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:00:10
Oi mate have ya checked the markets today? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:40:37
I started with and still suggest newcomers to use them to buy in. 
I like the simplicity and have yet to hear anything bad from my friends. In other words, I consider them very reliable.
Good luck and welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:48:46
Who got burned? Here’s who: How many of them got in below ~1200? How many got in at the top? How many “saw the light” as they like to say before ~Thursday? 
Nearly no one. They fomoed in and got left high and dry by Ver and co. 
No one in their right mind would back something riddled with such malicious tendencies towards its own base user. THEY PROFITED OFF OF YOU. It sucks, it really sucks because it weakened a lot. Hopefully those that got smacked can recover soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:52:46
Don’t get caught up in nonsense. Most of the BCH fans here are wanting to believe that Ver didn’t straight up rob them. (He did)
Also do not listen to your friend anymore on anything related to investing or crypto. 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:34:57

Remind yourself of this when it’s 10, 100 or beyond. 
You either buy into the idea or you don’t. 
If you have any source of a higher return investment I’d love to hear. Good luck.

“While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale."

As opposed to the venerable Roger Ver?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:18:26
Its more than similar enough to a few dozen other apps that it will at best struggle to differentiate itself. This is the hard fork of a fork that no one paid any attention to to begin with.

I offer a real advice and you come back with some troll bullshit? Fuck off mate 
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:09:26
Don’t. It’s a brutal world. 
Much more to it than plug in a couple computers and make free money. 
Buy and hodl, with prices the way they are for both btc and for mining(including diff and many horrible future diff adjustments for miners) it’s hard to encourage anyone to leap into mining right now. 
If you feel super compelled to not listen to my advice, read bitcointalk mining, learn about what pools to use, what makes a good miner and the rest of the variables. Invest in btc or save up for new tech which will very very likely make an appearance but July or so.
