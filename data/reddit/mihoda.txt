I'm going to let you think about this a minute. Bitcoin/Litecoin/whatever all started in the same place. Yet they all trade for non-zero amounts today. Why? 
Why should I put money in bitcoin when some other coin is even more deflationary? Why should I care about acceptance when all I care about is increased valuation that occurs in the adoption process?

Oh yes. It's all about *my needs.* Which is of course why pretty much *no one* wants to make cash purchases to small, unfamiliar, (and possibly fly-by-night) vendors on the internet. You know, we had a major national conversation about this in the mid 90s. People were terrified about purchasing from vendors they had no experience with. And chargebacks were the solution. So much so, that paypal arose from nothing to become the way that creditless people could use cash, and still issue chargebacks.

The key here is that a handful of trusted node servers could comprise the entire world payments system whereas based on the proof-of-work concept in a distributed trust system like bitcoin, the number of machines would be in proportion to the amount of fees people are willing to pay (presuming we are after the last coin is generated). 
This could potentially be as much in fees as people are willing to pay for Visa. Whereas the entire cost of running the trusted node system would be a few thousand dollars (at the level of sophistication provided for in the example).

I agree. But it does beg the question about how many private rights the individual cedes in having the government as an enforcer. With the government being the implicit third party to every contract, suppose you have a contract term or private property right that the government finds too odious to enforce?
A prime example of this would be 1950s and 1960s backlash against segregated businesses. The government found it too divisive to enforce private business segregation and so outlawed it.

The price at time of sale is **accounted for in dollars**. The sale in Bitcoins is for the dollar price * exchange rate.
The price at time of refund is the same dollar amount as that at time of sale. A BTC refund would be the sale dollar amount * the current exchange rate.
Time has elapsed between the purchase and refund. And the volatility of BTC is *exactly* why the unit of account is the dollar.
If you make a purchase from a foreign country that uses a different currency and then get a refund months later, *surprise*, you are not getting the same number of dollars back. Happened to me to the tune of $500 when I made a deposit at a foreign University.

This argument is agnostic with respect to time. It may be true, but it doesn't explain why the price is dropping NOW.


In net, this argument only applies if two conditions hold 1) Overstock and Tiger customers don't buy additional bitcoin 2) There are sales large enough to move the needle. Superficially there have only been a few million dollars in sales, less than a day's BTC volume over months. Hardly market moving.

While true it is possible that banks may collapse, you should keep in mind that banks are not just arbiters of cash, but also of investment accounts (as brokerages). And investment assets are (1) not subject to bank runs and (2) protected in the event of institutional insolvency.  Strictly speaking brokerages are not banks (though many banks are also brokerages), but they do function as accounting institutions (like the blockchain) for our nation's retirement assets.

Risk aversion suggests your framing is a little harsh. Human beings are risk averse (concave utility curves), and it has been demonstrated time and time again that people are willing to pay to lower the variance on outcomes (hence the insurance industry exists).
To frame FDIC fees and higher banking prices as a result of FDIC fees, as "being robbed fractions at a time," is hyperbole.


Arguing "zero sum" assumes that the merchant going out of business isn't an option. There's usually a reason chargebacks are issued, and for merchants that are forced to raise prices, that's a signal of incompetency being given to consumers. One which the merchants will be "punished' for as fewer purchases are made.  That is NOT a zero sum situation, since fewer overall sales occur.


Again, this is a gross misunderstanding of why people pay for insurance. People pay for insurance because they are risk averse. It provides more utility for participants to pay higher prices to avoid the risk of significant loss than it is to get 0-2% more goods with the savings.

You've perfectly illustrated the point that I've been trying to get across to my friends. BTC is may have a fixed rate of growth, but the very fact that anyone can come along and make a new one makes the concept of "zero growth" in BTC*like* coins impossible.

I'm not referring to the imaginary low and hi information voters you have in your head. I'm referring to the aggregate of participants.

Yes. I would be retarded to keep the amount of money we have in cash at home. I deal with federally insured banks.
My experience with bitcoin has been that 3rd party wallet apps are not ready for primetime since I've lost small, experimental amounts of BTC (~0.01 BTC) by doing something as simple as trusting that the wallet app actually meant that a backup to the external SD card, was actually a back up to the external sd card. Needless to say, the backup was to the internal SD card and when I reset my phone, the encrypted wallet backup was lost.  Silly me for trusting a message that literally read, "backing up to external SD card."
None of this shit is ready for prime time.

No, I'm arguing that inflation is so small as to be irrelevant.
Inflation has been between -1 and 3% (annualized rate) the last 10 quarters. And has averaged 2-3% the last 30 years. 


That is called cherry picking. If I used your methodology I could "prove" deflation by appealing to the price of food, clothing, vehicles, nearly every single item found within the home, etc.
Inflation is a weighted average of the price of a broad range of goods.


Nope. I'm an economist by training. There are plenty of third parties with their own price indices. These indices largely agree with the CPI series.


What I was getting at, is that you made an argument about future inflation. One which is instantly invalidated by appealing to current inflation, since current inflation is affected by expectations of future inflation.

CCs add about 2% in transaction costs to the price of goods. I get 1% cash back at the end of the year and have never paid a finance charge or interest in 15 years of having a credit card. Compare that 1% net cost to the cost of using exchanges/wire transfers to get bitcoin and pay for goods (~0.5% for the exchanges + wire transfer fees + exchange risk from hell).
On top of that I've charged back thousands of dollars in goods from merchants who have screwed me over and recouped the cost of lost air travel after one member of my party was diagnosed with severe illness.

This argument is agnostic with respect to time. It may be true, but it doesn't explain why the price is dropping NOW.


In net, this argument only applies if two conditions hold 1) Overstock and Tiger customers don't buy additional bitcoin 2) There are sales large enough to move the needle. Superficially there have only been a few million dollars in sales, less than a day's BTC volume over months. Hardly market moving.

Paradigm shifts occur where the benefits are overwhelming compared to the costs.
Bitcoin cost improvements are extremely marginal for use as a currency; maybe 0.5%-1%  over CCs when factoring in rewards programs and transfer fee. To replace CCs on a cost basis alone you have to figure the average person wants to bear 100% of the risk and responsibility for securing their keys for a tiny percentage, and even in that event there is no guarantee that BTC cost savings will be passed on as payment processors and exchanges will easily eat the savings during the USD to BTC transition period, [and the legal environment for charging different prices for different payment methods is hostile](
Person-to-person transactions within nations and supranational organizations will continue to be conducted in ACH, SEPA, or similar. SEPA is already costless and very fast, and ACH is under review by the nacha group(for speed imorovement). Cost and security beat speed for the majority of transfers, and BTC does not offer zero fee transfers between interest bearing, federally insured accounts with the capability of reversing errant transactions. In the banking and credit systems, I have never once in my life made an irreversible mistake that resulted in so much as a single dollar of liability, to the contrary I have saved thousands of dollars in dealing with fraudulent merchants. Meanwhile, in my short 3 year experience with BTC I have already managed to irretrievably lose a key in a hot wallet to a cell phone drive crash. It was only 0.04 BTC but should illustrate my point. The average person is not capable of securing their devices against adware, malware, and hardware failure, why would they bother to risk losing all but a pittance by handling BTC on their devices? If you want to learn more about this topic I suggest you look up "loss aversion." In behavioral econ it has been found that people are willing to pay quite a bit for security and in that regard BTC falls down on it's face.
To clarify, I believe BTC will be used where the benefits overwhelm the costs when compared to current systems. So remittances (fixed fee international wire structure results in high % costs compared to BTC) and black markets (pseudonymity very valuable). 
I am interested in BTC for use in micro transactions on the web but until there is a killer application for that (hint: it is not tipping) broad interest will be and has been pretty muted.

The important difference being that **the bank doesn't charge me for the privilege of transferring money to another customer at the bank.** In fact, the bank has *never* charged me a fee for any reason in the 20 years I've been with my bank. Not one finance charge, not one ATM charge, not one overdraft charge, not one international wire fee. They've even been kind enough to reverse *all of the fees* that I was damn well responsible for (day or two late on a CC payment). Bitcoin solves problems that largely don't exist, and of course for a fee.

Eh... It seems a bit optimistic to believe that the price of BTC would be close to parity with the dollar if the BTC economy were even a thousandth the size of the USD economy.
I believe tens of billions in cash/credit transactions occur daily within the United States. I can't find the figure, but this should be in the ballpark.
There are trillions of dollars of M2 and hundreds of billions of dollars of M1 in the US.
There will never be billions of bitcoins. There will never be hundreds of millions of bitcoins (these are just 3 orders of magnitude less than those in the last paragraph), therefore, a BTC economy three orders of magnitude smaller than the USD economy would necessarily have a more choked out supply of BTC than in the comparable USD economy.  A much more choked supply would result in a higher than parity exchange price. How much higher? Roughly 2-4 orders of magnitude.

The details here are missing some binding constraints (such as ASIC production rate) and a few other points are more precise than they should, but the general equilibrium reasoning is correct: at the margin processing power will be added until the return requirements of the very last miner in are just barely satisfied.
1) Rank order all miners with their required ROI.
2) Add them to the market one at a time.
3) The difficulty will increase until at some point, the ROI of adding a device falls below the ROI of the next miner in line.
4) That miner does not enter the market. Congratulations. You have an equilibrium.

While the block reward is relatively large compared to transaction fees, current bitcoin price is the sole determinant of network power consumption in the long-run. It is technology invariant *in the long-run equilibrium*. In the short-run there are shortages of latest gen technology (currently ASICs) that should keep power costs lower.
If you want to see the most conservative possible estimate of current power costs, here it is:
network hash / hash effeciency of the most efficient ASIC on the market
140,000 Ghops  / (0.107 Ghash/joule) ~ 1.4 MW
Obviously this is a lower bound since not every machine on the network is an ASIC. Using [Organofcorti's binned hashrates]( it's possible to make some basic assumptions about the broader distribution of miners in the market (eg: smaller miners must be using GPUs, since they don't make ASICs or FPGAs that slow) and then obtain a more accurate lower bound.

That's not my read. If $/BTC increases, then the network is sharing a growing pie. At the margin, investment still makes sense until the network hashrate is high enough that your share (expected price increase included) isn't over current electricity prices.
For current generation machines, ASICs, there is an additional buffer in that network hashrate cannot rise to the point where the cutting edge (being measured in mhash/joule) technology is in the red unless aggregate price assumptions are irrational (which they may be).

I beg to differ.
Network power usage is directly proportional (and very nearly equal to, when measured in MW) the exchange price in $/btc.

How long ahead of time did people order ASICs: A year.
Was it at all possible to calculate exactly when someone would receive their machine relative to the difficulty? No
Is it possible to get a refund on units not yet delivered?  No.
Will they shut off machines if they make a marginal amount of operating revenue? No.
Point stands.
@_date: 2013-09-16 13:54:21


This is a good argument. But it does fail to take in to account the endogeneity of the exchange price. Network hashrate depends on exchange price (though not at the moment since we are production limited by the number of ASICs companies can get out the door). 
So in calculating the lifetime output of the device, you are incorporating your exchange expectations via the backdoor.
Which I suppose means one could do the same thing you're talking about, decide between playing the exchange or buying the device, but by different reasoning.

The practical upper limit on cost is the block reward + transfer fees
Miners will not stay on if electricity costs are greater than the block reward + transfer fees.
Making the temporary assumption that hardware is free, then the upper limit on difficulty is the (block reward + transfer fees * exchange price) * (the price of electricity) * (hash efficiency of the best available technology in hash/s/joule)
At current (last 24 hrs)
230 blocks * 25 btc/block +31 (btc in fees) = 5781 BTC/24h
5781 BTC *  140 $/BTC * 0.010 MWh /$ = 8093 MWh in the last 24h
Power average at economic equilibrium would be: 8093/24 = 337 MW
Best available hash efficiency is unpublished. I'll ballpark this at 1000 Mhash/s/watt (aka Mhash/joule).
337 MW * 1000 Mhash/s / W = 337,000 * 10 ^12 hash/s = 337 *10^15 hash/s,
337 petahash/s

That, is a non-sequitur. But given the number I see in r/bitcoin and r/libertarian with regards to economics, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
There were regular, huge recessions (periods of zero or negative economic growth) prior to counter cyclical  monetary policy. Since then, with the exception of the great depression (during which the fed dropped the damn ball with countercyclical policy) and the great recession, every recession in the last 100 years has been under 1 year.
Previously, in the 1800s, recessions typically lasted 2-5 years with 2 recessions over a decade.

I intentionally selected CPI excluding food and energy because food and energy are short-run volatile and don't show long-term price movements.. Another possibility is to show 2 or 3 year smoothed CPI, but then, you basically get the same graph.
The point I'm making here, is that the Fed can stop QE at any time, AND reverse the effects of it. The cost is, as you've hinted, slower growth in the future, but the main idea is that QE avoids economic damage in the short-run (loss of capital, loss of skills etc) that may become permanent.

Well, it's not exactly an upperbound for the hashrate. If the "P" you put in is the better of the 1) current price or 2) market expectations for future price, then it is an upperbound. Even then, it's not JUST an upperbound. It's also the expected long-run equilibrium hashrate (limited only by ASIC delivery atm).
Reasoning: People will add processing units until adding units no longer generates net revenue. Of course that upperbound is wedged by things like uncertainty on the price, expectations of participants having a spread, and the capital costs of the hardware.
FYI, the formula for that is:
H = 150,000 * efficiency in mhash/j * price / (electricity price in $/kWh)
Units in mhash/s
The 150k is a conversion and time factor. Multiply by 1/2 to get the equilibrium hash for the 12.5 btc/block rewards. Also, doesn't include transactions as of yet.

Suppose you believed that the future exchange rate will rise. Do you A) Buy $250 worth of bitcoins or B) Buy a $250 minining device?
In the event that the price of bitcoins goes up, option (A) will net you a profit, option (B) will net you LESS of a loss until some exchange price where you break even.
In the event that the price of bitcoins goes down, option (A) will net you a loss, but are backstopped at $250 (B) you are out $250.
A rational actor will never purchase a mining device if they are operating under the expectation of an exchange rate increase.

Just parameterize the price and make all the columns a function of that parameter. Then people can choose whatever they want for that.
FYI, the general equilibrium market solution for the hashrate is that the hashrate rises until profit disappears ($/day = electricity cost). Of course this is under a uniform assumption of price by market participants, a mining hardware supply that can actually keep up, and ignores the effect of people with short horizons trying to recoup their initial investment.

Transaction fees.  Hear me out.
Absent a block reward for mining, transaction fees must cover network power costs. I estimate power use at 15-30 MW currently or, being generous and taking the lower bound: 15 MW * 10 /60 = 2.5 MWh/block. And at 15 c/kWh for electricity that comes to $375/block. It costs about $375 per 10 minute block to run the network.
There were [~58k transactions today]( or about 400 tx per 10 minute block.
$375/block and 400 tx/block comes to ~$1/tx.
**If the block reward didn't exist, transaction fees would conservatively need to be $1/tx to power today's network.**

So 1% from bitpay. Then add the btc transaction fee.

I was already factoring in discounts.
Today, the retail average price of power where I live in the United States is $150/MWh. The cheapest retail rates in the US are around $70/MWh (North Dakota). The rate negotiated by a large consumer of power, provided every bitcoin miner operated in one place in North Dakota and could exert their bargaining power, might be as low as $50-60/MWh.

You are fundamentally correct. My paper solves for the long-run equilibrium (machine supply unlimited). In the short-run, yes, there should be a shortage of ASICs.
It comes down to the fact that in equilibrium (again, going there, not there yet), expected network profits approach zero.  That should scare the hell out of anyone looking to buy a miner. So essentially:
25 bitcoins * price = cost of electricity  (both sides on a per block basis)
So just multiple both sides by oneover the price of electricity (a high one, to get a lower bound) and the hashrate/joule (of the best commonly available tech) and an appropriate time conversion factor, and presto, the network hashrate.
Want to account for capital? Then make an assumption about average miner expected time horizon (I would go with 1-2 months based on what is happening in current auction threads), then subtract, on a per block basis,  the left hand side.

localbitcoins.com is about buying and selling bitcoins, **not things.** This is definitely not helping your argument that bitcoin is somehow a currency entering the sphere of the broader public. When I can buy something other than LSD and overpriced pizzas, then maybe we can talk about bitcoin becoming a currency.  Which is why right now is the most interesting phase in Bitcoin, since there are some major merchants starting to experiment. Let's see what happens in six months, no sarcasm intended.
Personally, I do think Bitcoin fills a nice little niche. I haven't decided on where it will end up, but I can say that I don't see 100% adoption. But I don't care about that, I'm a speculator. Even 1-10% adoption will net a nice return.

p is $/btc. As p goes up, prices in BTC go down.
**Edit**: As the currency is adopted, p goes up. The reasoning here is simple: Currency supply is a fixed Q(t) and demand entirely sets exchange price.
In other words, the mere adoption of bitcoin is strongly deflationary. I'll come up with an exact estimate later, but the ballpark is about 50,000-500,000 $/btc in equilibrium (making the assumption that btc is adopted).

Formally, that is called the, "wealth effect." It is usually associated with assets, but I guess the glove fits for Bitcoin.


It is true that Bitcoin is pretty easy to make payments with, but I really don't see it as something I will switch to on a day-to-day basis. I have a credit card with a high limit (half a year's income), a good credit history, and a good relationship with my bank. I honestly prefer putting every single purchase on a credit card for two reasons: fraud protection (vendor fraud, obviously) and easy categorization/tracking of all my purchases (to track changes in spending habits).  Sure the 1% back rewards program is nice, but not the big seller.
I understand that people without easy access to credit will have a great time with Bitcoin, but I can't see many people with good credit leaving their credit cards. That's just absurd.

Yes. It's the prediction of any functioning market that revenues = costs.

In reality there are concessions for capital return and risk (eg: there is a chance that before your capital pays itself off that conditions change). The question is, how risk tolerant is the last person in the market. That is, if you lined up all the miner's by their risk tolerance, and found the last guy in line, what's his risk tolerance?

It's worth pointing out that they're only sticky down so long as we're nowhere near equilibrium in the mining market (eg: production limits the number of ASICs to the point we can't hit the expected hashrate for a  given market price).
When we are closer to that point, miners will shut off when exchange drops because they will be revenue negative regardless of sunk capital costs. Though given historic volatility and strategy/planning costs, people will likely keep machines on for 20-30% swings.
Of course when we are closer to that point, the expected profit IS the risk in the system.

Austrian econ is fundamentally out of step with observation. Its conclusions for the last century have been derived, for the most part, a priori, and lack evidence demonstrating even a basic consistency with reality.
Example: Inflation. Austrian economists talk about how price levels are directly related to increases in the monetary base. Then when the monetary base actually changes and price levels don't experience proportional swings, [an excuse or conspiracy is concocted]( to hide the lack of evidence.

The fed is on record with both its goals and methods. If you actually read the quarterly press release, the goal is to unwind its balance sheet over the 2015+ timeframe after deflation fears mitigate.
That was my whole point emphasizing repo: temporary purchase =&gt; unwinding.
Whether you trust the fed is another issue. Me, I have seen 33 years of the fed sticking to their promise to control inflation, good enough for me. And obviously bond markets and currency markets agree with. You could be right, but I wouldn't bet on it.

I am currently preparing an estimate for the BTC end.  The preview is that my preliminary results are 15-30 MW, with the actual value much more likely at the lower end of the range.

The FED actively manages the money supply specifically to manage inflation and price levels.
There is no one doing this for bitcoin. A pure bitcoin economy would be strongly deflationary during downturns and given 150 years of pre-Fed economic data, we know how that shit worked out (recessions lasting 5-10 years were pretty common).

I don't see how this is inconsistent with my claim: Miners pass on all costs.
Miners pass on, to annualize: 48,000*365/11,000,000/100 ~ 1.6% of the outstanding market value of bitcoins is paid in electricity prices to maintain the network every year.
Provided market price is stable at today's price, the average holder of bitcoins will lose 1.6% of the value of their btc holdings to these costs per year.

I don't think it's particularly hard for me to conduct day-to-day business in fiat. Personally I think it would be easier in bitcoin, but also riskier. Chargebacks and reversals are important to me.
And I have the same problems acquiring bitcoin: high transfer fees, shady off-shore exchanges potentially getting their accounts frozen, high trading costs (~1% + week delay when dealing in bulk).  And if one more person tells me to buy bitcoins locally, they can shove it up their ass. I'm not meeting a person with at a cafe and spending time waiting for confirmations with a ton of cash on me. Nor am I using localbitcoins (~1% + whatever the seller spread is).
Contrast this to fiat. Now the following is mildly ridiculous but it is lower cost:
1. I write a check, my friend scans it with his phone (2-3 minutes), boom the money is available.
2. I make an ACH transfer bank-to-bank with preauthorized accounts (2-3 days setup time first time). Free. Transfer time, instant at my bank, usually less than an hour during business hours.
3. I hand someone cash.
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:01:38


That is the part I'm interested in as an economist: how much are they willing to pay. Because with back of the envelope estimates, I come up with ~20 MW * 100 $/MWh = $48000/day in electricity costs spread over 54,000 transactions is roughly 90 cents/transaction.
Pretty darn steep.
I will cite the 20 MW figure in a paper. I've been somewhat sidetracked getting that one out.
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:18:55

Likewise, deflation refered to a contraction of the monetary base.

Suppose Bitcoin is volatile. And history has shown us that it tends to be volatile, regardless of your exchange.
Suppose a price difference emerged between CampBX and MtGOX.
Now you might expect that someone would take advantage of that by say, buying at one and selling at the other. Repeatedly. But there's a problem here. You'd have to move the fiat between the two. And we all know that the process there takes days unless you're willing to pay higher fees.
Another problem is that while you're waiting for the fiat to clear, the price of Bitcoin on the target exchange (the one with the lower $/BTC price) could move.
What you end up with, is that even without any sort of transaction delays, the price of BTC **can** differ by at least as much as the cost of moving BTC + fiat between the exchanges.
Toss in transaction delays and that volatility in price can wedge the difference between exchanges even larger.
@_date: 2013-06-03 13:46:40
I mean there is some non-zero equilibrium and a zero equilibrium.
Example: I believe that bitcoin will either go to zero, or go to X market share of store of value markets. I believe this with 80%/20% probabilities.
I don't just use the price of bitcoin as per the X market share of the store of value markets, I weight it by my expectation of that outcome.
Your expectations might not be binomial, you might consider an array of possible outcomes, in which case you could integrate over your probability density function (in my case discrete: 80% for 0, 20% for x).

Not. At. All.
The world has been moving away from money with intrinsic value and physical extent towards money with no intrinsic value and limited physical extent. And this demonstrates a much better understanding of currency as time and technology go by.
Gold is not even a half-decent store of value. The volatility of gold over the last 40 years has been much greater than the volatility of housing or the stock market.

It's pretty useful to be able to send money internationally on a short basis, but I can count the number of times I've needed to send money internationally (quickly) as exactly once.
Here's how sending money would work if I, personally, had to use bitcoin:
From the US I have these options with GOX:
1) CASH deposit at 10,000 locations in the USA (WITHIN 1 hour - at 3.75% fee!)
2) International Wire Transfer in USD (WITHIN 1 to 2 business days - NO FEE) (my bank fee on that is $20)
3) Deposit with Dwolla, wait at least a week.
Pay a fee to get USD to Mt.GOX --&gt; 0.6% trading fee to BTC (wait 6 confirmations)--&gt; Send BTC  (1-2 confirmations) --&gt; Friend recieves BTC ---&gt; Friend must convert BTC to AUD
Feel the convenience! Also, I could just use Dwolla to directly transfer money to you in Australia without all that other bullshit!
Alternatively, I could waste an hour of my time and go to a cafe and meet a stranger with cash to buy BTC.
