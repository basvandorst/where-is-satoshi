That was by design.  Read first sentence.
Not to say its good or bad either way, but its not a coincidence.
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:42:38
As does most of everything

Ya man you're spot on, the above guy is off the deep end of the libertarian pool.  
Private regulation doesn't work.  Bleeding heart libertarians giving me, (I'd say a practical libertarian) a bad name
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:09:08
No one has mentioned it because that't not what happened here.  Parallel construction is a massive problem, its just not quite this.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:17:19
What an awesome idea
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:41:43
You must be joking. Comeon the idealistic libertarian is too much for me
Banks were **soooo good at self regulation**


is an independent, not-for-profit organization that establishes safety criteria for a wide
variety of manufactured products, systems and components, 
 One example.  Cherry picking one tiny business is a pretty piss poor method of presenting anything
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:28:32
Totally agree on that.  The acceptance of extra legal methods scares the shit out of me.  esp after poor ross, that was a fucking joke.

You don't find it, even a little, unsettling that banks technically own the fed?
As the reddit quib goes, technically correct, the best kind of correct.

The line of thought I once heard that always stuck is:
"Local taxes, state and town are typically the things that are used for what people argue taxes are for: road schools police fire etc.  Federal money is used for kleptocracy and killing brown people"

Or, the more cyptocurrencies there are: they more legit they will be perceived.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:27:05
Its not a typo.  The 1,200 Trillion number is notional, most of it would (by definition) cancel it self out.  BakGikHung is correct, mostly meaningless number, but not a typo.

Multiple stage rockets doesn't really defend against the rocket equation.  The energy required is exponential with distance either way.  The stages are more like a "rocket transmission" allowing different types of rockets at different stages : take off, transit, land etc
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:20:29
[Roughly speaking, it is.](  


Linking to escape velocity does really apply.  Escape velocity is for objects which have already been imparted with kinetic energy, the rocket equations says "We have an object to which we must add kinetic energy, this is done with fuel, so we add the fuel.  The new fuel is now part of the system, which inturn requires its own fuel to bring it energy, etc....
You have ignored the main insight of the rocket equation, fuel needs to be brought along, which requires its own fuel which requires its own fuel... etc recursively exponentially.

You're fucked either way
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:53:40
Wait, what? Very confused
[My point is this](
Thats why the rocket equation eats your lunch, has nothing to do with stages.

You're fucked either way

@_date: 2012-09-24 13:07:03
Don't people have fun ways of doing probability?
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:46:46
ya, that's my point.
One of their recurring themes is that of a "conspirifacts" things that were cast as conspiracy until proven to be facts.
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:06:40
conspirifacts al la zerohedge

[Its also a great book about why debt will kill us all](
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:53:31
Don't do that, could make it completely clear you are the person doing this.  It is illegal after all.  Just spend it normally
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:18:47
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:55:58
If someone could explain these for the stupids in the thread... I would love you!
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:36:06
Sooooo update?
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:02:34
Great book by Graham.

interesting, I had always thought it was counted as defacing.

[Yes but keep in mind](
