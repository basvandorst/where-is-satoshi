Because it's very hard to keep a currency at 0% inflation and you definitely don't want it to be deflationary, so you stimulate it to be slightly inflationary.
At 0% inflation, there's no incentive to hoard your money, but there's also no incentive to spend it either. It's a lot better for the economy if people spend their money and there is money circulating, so if you make the money worth slightly less over time, then you encourage people to spend, and thus encourage the circulation of money.

You can still have a gold backed currency, without having to carry physical gold with you everywhere, right?

Did you know that 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE?
Clearly the best coin

A hard fork might invariably effect the price if it divides the community (and thereby potentially affecting what people think the actual value of that particular currency is).
But yeah, I wasn't sure why brought up forks when I was discussing inflation/deflation, because I don't think they have much bearing on that particular property.

Deflationary currencies are an awful idea. It encourages people to hold on to money instead of spend it on assets, which causes markets (which we need) to collapse. A small amount of inflation is the best way to maintain our current way of life.

A fork shouldn't directly impact the inflation or deflation of the currency? Unless I'm missing something here?
