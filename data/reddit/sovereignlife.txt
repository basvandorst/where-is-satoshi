I'm a keen MaidSafe supporter and bought my first MaidSafeCoins just after the original crowd sale. Personally I see this as a game changer for the internet, just as Bitcoin is for the money/financial system. And now it's in Alpha release I am following very closely - and buying more coins :)

Merchants don't accept Bitcoin directly, but via a merchant payment processor. This means the customer is not paying any transaction fee to buy something with Bitcoin, as the transaction is off-chain. 
The merchant is not actually accepting Bitcoin, rather they are enabling customers to spend it, while their merchant account processor deposits Yen to their business bank account.

If we're going to display bits, which is good in many ways, we should always quote the full Bitcoin price as well, which confirms its value. Don't want people to think Bitcoin "dropped" to cents.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:16:51
Most retailers accepting Bitcoin do so using a payment processor who converts to their local currency, so the customer pays no fee for making a payment in Bitcoin.
Accepting Bitcoin directly, with no conversion, is a long way off - due to Bitcoin's volatility. But even then, unless individual fiat currencies collapse there will always be a barrier to accepting Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:28:52
Excellent overview and explanation - thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:11:29
If the payment is made via a Bitcoin payment processor (Japanese equivalent of BitPay), then you wouldn't be paying a fee, just the Bitcoin equivalent of the taxi fare. And I would suggest that's what's happening here - it's too early days for taxi drivers to be accepting Bitcoin direct, and accepting the exchange risk.

There seems to be a lot of confusion in all the comments here. First of all a "debit" card is not a credit card, it only draws down on the balance you actually have.
Second, using a debit card to access funds converted from Bitcoin is just another way of converting Bitcoin to fiat. If you're happy to sell Bitcoin on an exchange and have the funds wired to your bank account, then having a debit card is a much easier way to achieve the same thing.
This is good news for Bitcoin. It means those holding Bitcoin (an appreciating asset) can easily spend it when required. It offers more choice and more reasons for people to adopt.
Think of it this way. Instead of having most your savings in a depreciating fiat currency, you have the option of holding it in an appreciating crypto-currency, while suffering no disadvantages as a consumer.
This type of thing will increase the number of people who buy into Bitcoin, which in turn will increase the incentive for merchants to accept it directly.
It's a win-win.
@_date: 2014-12-14 03:34:39
The truth is, many people stumbled upon Bitcoin back then, including me - but didn't act on it, as it seemed to0 difficult to get ahold of - and clearly speculative and experimental. It wasn't until Mt Gox was functioning that I managed to get my hands on Bitcoin when it was $6.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:15:51
I don't get the negative comments on Bitcoin debit cards. In principle it's no different that selling Bitcoin on an exchange and withdrawing the proceeds to your bank account - except easier, which is why many people (including me) use one.

There is no doubt Bitcoin was built on a philosophical premise. But it's also true that mass adoption will not require people to either agree or understand that premise. Bitcoin will succeed because it works. When the infrastructure becomes more user-friendly and the benefits of Bitcoin are obvious to anyone who looks, then adoption is only a matter of ..." it works brilliantly, does what I want, and I'm going to use it". Nothing more, nothing less.

In my view Satoshi Nakamoto knew what he was doing, by making Bitcoin attractive as an asset class. You see, its rising value is what attracts people and drives accumulation. At some point, the prices rises sufficiently to cause holders to want to spend some of their bitcoins, and so the process goes. The speculative nature of Bitcoin can thus be seen as a driver of adoption, by appealing to people's self interest. Don't worry, there will be plenty of people spending their bitcoins as the price rises - simply because they will want to cash out on some of their profits and buy stuff. Just wait and see.

Interesting article and raises the obvious point that we will need to start dealing in micro-bitcoins before too long.

You need to download Electrum to a different device, open it and choose restore, enter seed - create new password.
The reason you cannot do this on your current system is because Electrum is already on there and you cannot have two wallets on the same system.

This looks very interesting. The ability to use debits cards funded by Bitcoin has significant appeal and demand. I realise some people think this is simply missing the point of Bitcoin, but it's not. It's just another way of "selling" your Bitcoin by spending it. No different from sending your bitcoins to an exchange to sell. But with a debit card you avoid the exchange and the hassle of an additional step.

Gold is not intrinsically valuable. Value is subjective, it's how humans think about something that makes it valuable. If people think gold is a good hedge against inflation, then people will buy gold. But its value is entirely a matter of supply and demand, and whether anyone actually wants it. Gold may have other uses, but that does not account for its value, which is tied to the perception it is an asset-protection vehicle.
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:32:26
I have to agree with you. Like it or not, the masses will never take up the level of security self-responsibility required. They will look for services offering secure storage for them - that is when mass adoption will occur. Of course, everyone else is free to manage security for themselves.

@_date: 2014-07-24 10:30:16
The writer has things the wrong way around. If you look at Bitcoin's history so far, adoption has been driven by the rising price. What makes Bitcoin attractive right now is the possibility of its price rising considerably over time.
In my opinion, the spending side of the Bitcoin economy will come later, when more people have climbed on board because of perceived future gains.

You can escape taxes, you just have to be willing to be a non-resident for tax purposes... which in practice meaning living in different countries (or at least three countries) each year. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for US citizens (who are taxed whether they are in the US or not).

I've just registered an account because I like to check out all things "new" in Bitcoin. My initial feedback is that at first the interface was a little confusing once logged in.
I can see a function for connecting to friends, but no function for sending anything to anyone. 
Under the "Select Friends" menu it shows all my contacts, although the button only appears to be an invite button - presumably inviting them to register with bit connect.
Another strange thing is, at the top of that connect window it says I have "193 or 512 invitations used" - but I haven't used or initiated any invitations. 
I find it confusing, so am concerned that others (if I recommend it) will also find confusing.

I think Bitcoin will succeed regardless of political subtext - because it offers benefits to everyone.
Just one benefit, which is huge, is the fact the Bitcoin represents a monetary system that is NOT based on debt. This alone has the potential to benefit so many people on this planet, that it overrides all political considerations. 
Andrew Galambos (Sic Itur Ad Astra) predicted that freedom would arrive - not via the ballot box, revolution or protests, but via products and services in the free market that increase practical freedom, while appealing to a person's natural self interest.
Bitcoin fits that freedom definition perfectly!

A second passport is like insurance. It gives you the option to live somewhere else when the going gets tough. 
Think of it this way. A passport is actually an "ownership" document, saying which country "owns" you. So if you want to increase your freedom it pays to belong to more than one owner, in case you're being abused by such. And it gives you the option of disowning your previous owner, if you're being abused too much!

With a deflationary currency your spending power goes up over time. It encourages saving, which is a good thing because saving leads to capital formation. Inflationary currency encourages people to spend now because tomorrow their money will buy less, thus it discourages saving and capital formation. 
Does that mean deflationary currency stops people spending? Of course not. We all need things and we all buy things. What it does do is provide incentives to save and the realisation that when we spend we are getting more for our money. And that is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:31:21
No, hoarding/saving is not an issue. In fact, I believe it's part of the genius of Satoshi Nakamoto's design - mass adoption will arrive because holding Bitcoin is profitable. And once millions of people have Bitcoin that's rising in value, they will start to spend it as a way to realise their profit. Self interest/human nature.

There is a difference in perception. A gift card is an accepted payment device, a substitute for something else. You don't need to provide ID, palm scans or any verification to buy gift cards. 
On the other hand, if you make a "coin" which works like a gift card, then it is perceived as a coin by the government.
I think they are a great idea and perhaps the easiest way for beginners to get their hands on some bitcoins.

Well, with such a clear statement, we can all sit back and wait and see if such is actually the case. It's not often someone puts their reputation on the line in such an obvious way.
However, it would not surprise me if we are indeed heading to a new bull market, because we've been in a bear market all year - and moving into the new year could indeed change sentiment.

I'm a long time apple user and I'm not about to ditch my MacBook Air or iPhone over this. However I have signed the petition quoted on Blockchain's letter to Apple, as I certainly would like to see Apple change its stance. Personally, I do not think it's about Bitcoin "hate", rather it's a conservative corporate stance based on the wrong assumption that Bitcoin is not "legal" - i.e. not legally defined in most countries. And as such, I believe Apple will change its policy when Bitcoin achieves such global legal definition, which I'm sure will be before the end of this year. Meanwhile, I'm perfectly happy with my Electrum wallet and Blockchain on the web.

Leaving aside the question as to whether taxation is even moral, a tax based on sales rather than income is certainly an improvement. Why? Because at the root of the state's need to know about our finances is the fact they tax us on such information.

The article made me laugh at it's plainly not going to happen. 
I have a keen interest in Scotland's independence referendum, my father having been born there. And I'm heading to Edinburgh on the 18th of this month for the annual Jazz &amp; Blues festival. I'm also keen to get a sense of what locals think about independence.
As to arguments about the pound and the UK government saying they can't have it. Bollocks of course, because even as a last resort there is nothing to stop Scotland from simply using the pound. Sure it would have no control over monetary policy, but it would be able to use it, just like some countries in the world use USD.
The idea of a country using Bitcoin as its currency is far-off if ever. The essence of government is to be able to exploit voters (buying votes) by manipulating the currency and having access to debt - all impossible with Bitcoin. So don't expect governments anywhere to willingly give up on their fiat currencies.
That's not to say that people won't abandon them though, especially in countries where the local currency goes down the toilet.

I think that at this stage of its development Bitcoin is indeed a speculative investment vehicle, and I think Satoshi planned it that way.
Why? Because the most effective way to get adoption is to appeal to human nature. When more and more people realise Bitcoin is an appreciating asset (compared with money in the bank and elsewhere), then those people will move into Bitcoin precisely to invest.
This will continue until some sort of equilibrium is reached and the rate of increase slows down considerably. 
It is then, when you have mass holding of Bitcoin that you will see the spending that results. No one simply wants to hold money forever, and the need for stuff will cause people to start spending their investment gains - and this will in turn generate the mass adoption of Bitcoin as a currency.
It's all a matter of timing.
@_date: 2014-06-11 00:21:22
The comment regarding the price coming down as a result of mass acceptance is certainly not true. Bitcoin must have a price that can accommodate a massive volume and transactions going forward, so a higher price in the future is baked in.

What was interesting about that discussion was the fact that Ebay was instrumental in getting PayPal off the ground. In other words, a killer auction/sales medium that only allowed one payment method - PayPal - drove adoption.
I think something similar would be great for Bitcoin - a killer consumer service of some sort that pulled in users, who once there were 'forced' to use Bitcoin as the default payment method.
Clearly, such an service couldn't be just a copy of Ebay, but would need to be something quite different, and yet with the same global reach and potential.

There's no getting away from the fact that Bitcoin will enable more people to "under-report" income for tax purposes. This already happens on a mammoth scale with regards to cash transactions - and so it will be with Bitcoin. The end result will be that governments will be forced to find new ways to tax, other than income - like VAT etc. In the great scheme of things, moving tax away from income would be a revolution of its own, and a major step forward for financial privacy.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:20:32
I would remind people that a "loss" when it comes to the IRS would be a loss of original capital. So if you originally purchased $1,000 worth of BTC when it was $30 per Bitcoin, and it rose to $1,000 per BTC a year later, only to drop to $500 thereafter - you would not have a loss at all, but still a taxable profit - based on what you originally paid.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:02:08
Yes, simple enough if you're holding Bitcoin for the long term and sell some once in a while. But to treat daily expenditure using Bitcoin as a taxable event is seriously misguided. But hey, government is a seriously misguided enterprise. Hopefully, this ruling will change in time, as the true nature of Bitcoin - which is not just property - becomes clearer.

I believe Bitcoin itself is the killer app, because it represents a market-driven, peer-to-peer, debt-free currency. Being issued debt-free is huge. All fiat money is issued as debt. If every entity on earth repaid all loans and didn't borrow any more, then all fiat money would disappear. The advantages of a debt-free currency are huge, but added to a peer-to-peer payment network, without any state of company involvement is history-changing. 
So the killer app will be what makes it incredibly easy to use Bitcoin - in purchasing, saving and spending. 
Once a critical mass of adoption is reached, the clear advantages of Bitcoin over government-issued money will be so obvious that people will flock to it.

With the usual "tax evasion is illegal" disclaimer... blah blah, let's admit the obvious. Governments are in the business of forcing "services" on us at gunpoint. I have always held to the philosophy that if you can intelligently and effectively reduce tax, then do it. For always keep in mind the "legal" is not the same as the "moral". 
In my case I refuse to pay taxes, because if I did, then my money would be funding immoral acts - such as war and other nefarious anti-freedom things. I cannot morally sanction paying tax to fund such things "in my name". So over the last 14 years I have been living tax-free (and legally) as a "PT" - permanent tourist - which means not living on a country long enough to become a resident for tax purposes.
Bitcoin offers those who desire to shift themselves out of the "slave status" of taxpayers into the freedom realm, the perfect opportunity to do so, by moving their life 100% into Bitcoin.
This may be a little difficult to do right now, but I'm confident that by the end of 2014 there will be so many options for buying/paying/living using Bitcoin that this option to "opt-out" will be even more attractive.
Andrew J Galambos - a genius in my opinion - said that freedom will never arrive via the ballot box by voting, nor by protesting or rioting - but via the market place. Freedom will arrive as products and services that offer real freedom to those who use them. Bitcoin fits the description perfectly :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:25:40

The currency issue, regarding independence for Scotland, is indeed interesting. The SNP is all for the euro, as it sees Scotland joining the EU as part of its plan.
However, for a country such as Scotland which historically has had a lot of experience in banking, and still actually prints its own banknotes (issued by at least two private banks to my knowledge) it would seem that even starting with their own currency would not be a stupid idea.
Joining the EU appears to be counter-intuitive thing to do for a nation that wants true independence, as EU membership increasingly involves overriding national sovereignty.
Simply using the pound creates issues with monetary policy, as the pound is created by the Bank of England. Independence from the UK politically is one thing, but remaining joined at the hip by using the pound would ensure that the Bank of England still retains control over such issues as money supply, quantitative easing etc.
Of course, the idea of a nation adopting Bitcoin is premature right now, although totally feasible down the track I believe.

A quick bug report. I sent QuickCoin 0.05 BTC from my Electrum wallet. That part went fine. However, the balance on QuickCoin was quoted as 9948538.58 - which was over $5,000!!!
I realised this was an obvious error and logged out, then logged back in. This time the correct balance was showing.
Everything else when fine when I sent some BTC to family members :)

Adoption of Bitcoin is driven by its price. This was part of the Satoshi plan. Create a currency that grows in value as a way of attracting people to the platform. Massive adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method will actually come later. 
Think about it. People are not drawn into Bitcoin just to spend it. There's no incentive. Why go to all the bother and expense of buying bitcoins just to spend them the next day?
No, ordinary people will only adopt Bitcoin en masse when it fulfils two things - rising value (store of value) and easy to use.
We are in the early phase, where it's the attraction of capital gains (selfishness) that is bringing people in.

There's not really much else to add. I simply sent some Bitcoin to QuickCoin and the balance showing as received was as quoted. At first, I went back to my Electrum wallet to ensure the right amount - 0.05 BTC - was actually sent, and it was.

Peter Schiff would like to see a digital gold currency - like the defunct e-gold - rise again. However, his argument against Bitcoin works against gold also. 
If merchants were to accept Schiff's digital gold, they would also convert it instantly to local currency, and for the same reasons, because gold is volatile and merchants would not want to hold it. 
But it doesn't matter one whit!
Bitcoin is more than just a currency. The fact it doesn't conform to what currency has always been is besides the point. Bitcoin is a transferrable asset - as transferrable as any currency, anywhere in the world. 
So while all other currencies continue to lose value, Bitcoin (due to its deflationary nature) rises. Having bitcoin in your wallet is much smarter than holding dollars - and yet, with increasing adoption it will function as a currency as well. 
Bitcoin is many things: a crypocurrency, a digital asset, a distributed payment network, the block chain ... etc. etc. 
Trying to pidgeon-hole it into one definition doesn't work, which is why so many mainstream financial and economics commentators are so wrong on so many counts.
But it doesn't matter if they say "it's NOT currency", because people can and do use it as currency, and increasingly so. And they also use it to store value.

I have an account with this bank so know exactly how it works. It's simple really. As a customer of the bank you can purchase gold, which in is stored with the Perth Mint in Western Australia. This gold (and its current value) is listed in your account along with your currencies. 
The "gold" card functions like any debit card and when you want to fund it, you sell some of your gold for dollars and those dollars are credited to your card so you can spend.
In this sense it works like the new Cryptex card. You load bitcoins to a Cryptex wallet, convert some bitcoins to dollars, which are then loaded on to the card.

In my opinion, it is the potential for Bitcoin to rise in price which holds the key to its wide adoption. Yes, for all of 2014 we have been in a bear market, with more recent periods best described as a "lull". But once the market decides the "bottom" is truly in, then a return to a bull market is very likely. 
Once this happens, people will pour into Bitcoin again - precisely because the price is rising. It is a rising-value Bitcoin that will drive adoption - because everything else out there is falling in value.

Thank you. I really enjoyed your personal story - and even though I assume you're young and idealistic, at 65 years old I share your views. 
I purchased my first bitcoins when they were just $6. I believe this is the future. I also know this is the greatest freedom technology developed in my lifetime, and I'm thrilled to see the progress and development in this space.
All this reinforces the ideas in a book I read in 2000 - Sic Itur Ad Astra (This is the way to the stars), by astrophysicist Andrew Galambos.
He asserted that freedom would never arrive via the ballot box, through revolution, protesting or violence - but via technology and the free market.
He predicted that freedom would be a product that people would want, and that freedom would be delivered - not by politicians and other sociopathic fraudsters, but by talented people producing products and services that enhance such freedom.
Now, just 14 years later, I see the truth of Galambos's words, that technology and the free market are delivering what was hitherto impossible - freedom for mankind.
I am thrilled to live in such a time in history, to witness the transformation in how young people think - and hopefully to see a great deal of freedom in what remains of my own life.

The psychology of a turning point from bear market to bull market is interesting for sure. But basically it's all about the "moment" when people believe Bitcoin is rising again, not falling anymore. At that point, selling sentiment turns into buying sentiment, setting off a self-reinforcing momentum for rising prices. 
The trick is to know when this moment is upon us.

I totally agree. Without "hoarding" or saving as it should be called, there is no price increase. It is because I believe Bitcoin to be superior to fiat currencies that I choose to save them, not spend them.

That was a very clear exposition of what Bitreserve is all about - which as an account holder myself, is much appreciated. :)
I do, however, have a quibble about what you said here:
"Holding bitcoin because you think it's value will go up can only hurt the aforementioned goal, because it leads to hoarding, or to the destructive feedback loop of speculation."
I don't think anything can be "done" regarding Bitcoin's volatility, as it is a function of this emerging market. And so is "hoarding" as you put it. But I find the word "hoarding" to be a loaded word, implying something bad. Fact is "hoarding" used to be called saving - a worthy endeavour.
It's the potential for a significant price rise (hence volatility) that is the main attractor for Bitcoin at this present stage. And I see it as a stroke of genius that this is so. 
In other words, with a rising price and decreasing volatility, people will take notice of Bitcoin and want it - hence wider adoption. And while saving may appear to be a brake on such adoption, I don't believe it is. It's just a matter of timing. No one will "save" Bitcoin forever, and at some point will start spending it. And that's when Bitcoin will move into its full potential as a currency.
Meanwhile, I can see value in what Bitreserve offers.

This article makes a fundamental error is naming 'interest' as the bogeyman. Yes, the three Abrahamic religions have generally been against interest in the past, but this misses the real point, which is...
The real bogeyman is money created as debt. When you have a money system where all money is debt, it is clearly impossible to solve the debt problem with more debt.
However, a debt-based money system is great for the bankers, because in reality they can create money out of thin air and charge interest on it. 
With Bitcoin there is nothing wrong with the concept of lending it at interest, and the reason is that Bitcoin is debt-free money. It comes into existence, not as someone's debt, but as a real asset. And if someone has a surplus of Bitcoin and is prepared to lend some at interest, this is a perfectly legitimate economic transaction.
Interest is not the enemy, debt-based money is.
Bitcoin is the means of escaping perpetual debt-enslavement.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the regulation being spoken of can only impact on those organisations at the fringe of Bitcoin - businesses that offer services where Bitcoin "meets" fiat currency, like exchanges.
If such regulation helps Bitcoin get accepted, which I think it will, then that is a good thing. Why? Because by enabling wider usage of Bitcoin in a "regulated" environment, everyone's Bitcoin holding becomes more valuable and more useful. 
But more importantly, for those who want to move economic activity into Bitcoin, and stay in Bitcoin, then the core protocol enables anyone, anywhere, to deal 'off-fiat' and not have to come in contact with the regulated businesses.
Once the Bitcoin economy grows sufficiently so that an individual can freely spend bitcoins to meet his or her common economic needs, then the requirement for exchanging out becomes mute, as does the exchange service that enables it. 
So a thriving and growing Bitcoin economy can only become a global behemoth with the "nod" of approval from the regulators. But once Bitcoin hits critical mass adoption, people can choose to live 'off the grid" and not deal with the regulated entities, or fiat, to whatever degree makes them happy.

As someone who has traveled to China more than 15 times and has a Chinese partner, I have been fascinated by the Chinese response to Bitcoin. 
There are a number of cultural reasons for this. 
First, Chinese are mega-savers. They put us Westerners to shame. Even lowly paid labourers save - no matter how small their income. Chinese savers have trillions in the bank.
Second, Chinese love to gamble and speculate.
Third, Chinese do not trust their government, nor the yuan. They constantly seek a safe-haven for their savings.
Fourth, Chinese are uncanny networkers, passing on information via their favourite app - WeChat - in ways us Westerners find hard to fathom.
So when Chinese start to go for something like Bitcoin, the network effect is much stronger and more powerful than in Western societies.
And just to conclude, even my partner's mother (a grandmother) is an avid holder of Bitcoin.

The idea that Bitcoin adoption will come by merchant's accepting it is all wrong. Right now Bitcoin is not a good currency... too volatile. 
Merchants who "accept" Bitcoin, actually don't. They can't risk holding it, so it's converted immediately to fiat. 
How does this help Bitcoin adoption? It doesn't.
The only way to adoption is through the incentive of "gain" - i.e. as in Bitcoin's increasing value. The total value of Bitcoin needs to grow significantly in order to reduce volatility.
So, merchant acceptance will come when future millions of holders decide it's time to spend some. And by then, hopefully Bitcoin will be widely considered as "better money" where merchants are eager to accept it and hold it - even offering discounts to get their hands on it.
Meanwhile, the thing that will drive adoption is self interest - the hope that one's Bitcoin stash is going up in value. As more people see the proof of this, they will want Bitcoin too.
The simple economic desire to protect one's money using Bitcoin will bring people in... leading to mass adoption in the future.
Bitcoin as "currency" will naturally evolve after this stage.

I think "bit" is a perfectly good way to describe the unit, in the same way people say "buck" for dollar. It's not necessary to call it by some mathematically precise name, rather what's easily adopted - which some wallets already have.
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:11:39
The thing is, it's the fact Bitcoin is seen as an investment (albeit risky) that is pulling people in. Nothing will grow the Bitcoin ecosystem more than prices rises. This is the way to more adoption. And when there are enough people who are convinced Bitcoin is better money, you will then see the development of Bitcoin as better "currency" - as in payments network.

I understand the sentiment, but the fact is people will spend what they value least - in this case fiat. 
Now, for someone to go to the trouble of spending Bitcoin and replenishing it by buying more after, is simply not going to work. Ordinary folk will never do it, and it's not the way things will work.
At this stage of Bitcoin's development holding is the best strategy, as it triggers the desire to gain - which is the real motive as to why people buy Bitcoin in the first place. 
This desire to gain/profit is what is creating the network effect, not the fact you can spend Bitcoin. Sure, everyone will spend Bitcoin at some time, but right now, with the rapid gains in value of Bitcoin, it's entirely rational to hold it.
However, in the future, more and more people will start spending Bitcoin, simply because they have gained so much from it. 
In this way it will transition from simply a "savings" vehicle to a monetary use vehicle and Bitcoin will slowly morph into both savings and spending.

I always find discussions of "censorship" miss the point. 
If I invite 20 people into my home for a discussion, I have the right to eject anyone who causes trouble or for any reason I like. This is not censorship, it's me enforcing my property rights.
On the other hand, if a government agency forces me to eject someone from my home, because of his viewpoint or opinions, then he is definitely being censored - by the state.
A forum or discussion board is "owned" by someone - the person doing the moderating perhaps - and as owners they can make whatever rules they like, including being able to ban people they consider undesirable.
That banned person, of course, is entirely free to either create his or her own discussion forum and say whatever they wish - or find a more "friendly" forum that's happy to have them.

I've been with e-coin/wirex for over two years and have never had problems. In fact I believe they offer an excellent and innovative service - where one can fund their card with fiat, buy Bitcoin instantly - and just as easily fund with Bitcoin and load to the card, again instantly. 
Calling this service a "scam" is a great disservice to the word "scam" - making it meaningless.

The whole idea of a government/fed managed interest rate goes against everything the free market stands for, and is in fact the socialisation of monetary policy.

Has anyone considered that what goes on over on r/btc may be a "black opp" - something engineered by a government entity of some sort, with the purpose of causing discord and using the age-old trick of "divide and rule" to undermine Bitcoin?
A few months back I was reasonably open minded on this issue and subscribed to r/btc to get a feel for that position and try to evaluate both in my own mind. I continued to read both forums daily, until yesterday when I unsubscribed from r/btc.
Why? Well, I'm not a technical person, but I do grasp the essential importance of Bitcoin, as someone who's been involved since 2011. And what convinced me of the wrongness of the 'other side' was simply the tone of the discussion over there - which in turn revealed the nature and minds of the contributors.
I simply felt deeply uncomfortable reading the ongoing posts about core conspiracies, segwit deficiencies and the blockstream "borg" stuff. Or to put it another way, I started intensely disliking what I saw as the inner driving "spirit" of the main protagonists.
In the end, I simply couldn't read any more and tuned out.

You should receive notification of the transfer virtually immediately. Confirmation will take longer. And just to be clear, you don't actually receive or store Bitcoin in your wallet, rather your wallet (and its private key) shows you the amount of Bitcoin you own on the blockchain.

While some commentators here think we are in some sort of bubble already, I certainly don't think so. 
Having been watching and owning Bitcoin since mid-2011, this current rise is part of a genuine bull market. 
We spent all of 2014 in price decline correcting the mania of late 2013. We spent all of 2015 in a virtual sideways boring price range. And we have spent all of 2016 rising (on trend).
The difference between this past year and 2013 is the fact the rise is constantly being corrected. So instead of a near-vertical rise from $100 to over $1,100, we are seeing a much more moderated rise, with regular profit taking.
I expect this trend to continue, and not to see such near vertical rises and catastrophic crashes in the future.
As for those hoping for a price drop to $500, so they can buy in, I would say we have seen a whole year of measured price rises, struggling through the $700s and finally breaching $800. I don't think we'll be seeing $500 again.
For those who intend to hold Bitcoin longer term, the best time to buy is "now". Hoping for an unrealistic major price drop will likely only end in disappointment.

No Bitcoin whale holds forever. As the price moves up, substantial holders find a reason to take profits - those coins are sold to others. So as price rises wider distribution occurs.

This is a common error in thinking. 
Merchants will not adopt Bitcoin as it's too volatile. But it's not just that. If you live in the UK and go for a holiday in the USA, US merchants certainly won't accept your GBP. Instead a Visa/MC card converts your purchase into dollars in order to credit the merchant in his local currency.
If you want to spend your Bitcoin you have to sell it first. Selling it via a card that converts Bitcoin to fiat is a smart way to achieve this. Otherwise you have to sell it via an exchange.
The tangible benefit is that you can keep your funds in Bitcoin until you choose to spend it, meanwhile you get to gain from a likely rise in the Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:08:08

Just sent you a tip from my Bluewallet :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:15:02
Right now transaction fees are high for sure. However, if you play around with wallets you will notice quite a difference often. 
For example, this morning I needed to send around $50 worth of Bitcoin to a colleague, to pay back something. At first I tried Jaxx (as I use it as a quick wallet) and noticed the fee was a staggering $26! 
I then tried the latest version of Exodus and it displayed a pending fee of $7.60 - somewhat better.
Finally I got out my trusty Trezor and set the fee to "low" (without even bothering to set a custom fee), I got it down to $2.60 - so I sent it. 
So even in this high fee environment, I was able to send funds for $2.50 and have 3 confirmations within 30 minutes. I have no doubt I could have got it lower by setting a custom fee.

Interesting article. I certainly believe that any misdirection away from the money purpose of Bitcoin is a mistake. What makes Bitcoin so revolutionary is the fact it is a "new" money - money created not by banks and governments, but by a computational process that cuts out all these power mongers. Bitcoin's future value is entirely dependent on adoption as money and currency. All ideas about using the blockchain to move contracts and fiat currencies around will do nothing for Bitcoin's value as money, because technologies such as Coloured Coins, MasterCoin and others can do all that using micro-fractions of Bitcoin - so any volume of business on such networks will have no upward impact on Bitcoin's price. Only adoption and treating Bitcoin as much better form money - and a store of value - will drive Bitcoin forward.

What's exciting about Bitcoin is it's unpredictable, so one person's speculation is as useful or not, as anyone else's. However, there are definitely the emotions of fear and greed in any market - and if Bitcoin's price shows a substantial trend upwards, sufficient enough to trounce the bearish sentiment that has existed for the past 18 months, then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy as more people jump on for the ride - pushing the price higher.

Bitcoin can't be used directly at point of sale because it takes time to confirm a transaction. So whatever happens in Japan it is likely to be managed via an off-chain merchant solution like BitPay - or a Japanese equivalent. 
Bitcoin being "accepted" is a bit misleading as it's too volatile for businesses to accept and hold, so a third party off-chain service seems inevitable, which credits the merchant with Yen, not Bitcoin.

With Blue Wallet you do not have to open a channel at all. 
The process is like this. Fund your wallet with some Bitcoin (this is on chain). When cleared use all or some of this Bitcoin balance and send it to the address provided automatically within your Lightning wallet section of the app. 
When that clears you will have a balance in  your Lightning wallet, which you can spend anywhere Lightning is accepted. You can also receive Bitcoin via Lightning by generating an invoice within the app.
Hope that's clear :)

Not entirely sure what you mean. When you generate a Lightning invoice it's because you are wanting to receive payment. This is not on chain. If you are paying out via Lightning invoice those funds are also not on chain. You can, however, remove funds from Lightning section of your Blue Wallet, back to the Bitcoin section - and that is on chain.

Over the last couple of days I've been playing around with the latest version of Blue Wallet, which I have to admit is the first wallet I have had success in making both payments and receiving funds via invoices using Lightning. 
I like what they're doing because I know that for ordinary folk, having your own node will not be an option. So we're going to see custodial solutions in the channel side of things - which is what Blue Wallet does.
It's really simple. First you create two wallets within the app - one for Bitcoin and one for Lightning. You fund Blue Wallet with some Bitcoin. Once confirmed you "refill" your Lightning wallet from within Blue Wallet. Once that refill is confirmed your Lightning balance is showing and you can spend it. 
I tested this using [ which I found from a list of Lightning accepting stores here: [
I purchased 50 spins and paid using the pop-up payment window, which I proceeded to scan from within Blue Wallet. The payment and credit of slot machine spins was instant. 
I then tested the withdraw winnings function on the slot machine site, and created a payment invoice within Blue Wallet. Once again everything went smoothly and I received the claimed winnings.
If you're looking to experience Lightning then Blue Wallet will give you that experience, as well as a taste for how easy it is - not to mention being fast and cheap.

Never forget that Satoshi was also smart enough to harness human greed in order to incentivise Bitcoin's adoption. To put it another way, it's not the fact you can spend it that's giving Bitcoin adoptive traction, but that people see its rising value.

For a fork to have any chance of success it must offer something that is different and a considered (by some) improvement on Bitcoin. 
Any fork that was a direct copy would clearly fail. So the question is, how many distinct improvements/features (currently missing from Bitcoin) could be incorporated into a future fork, sufficient for it to have some level of market acceptance?
My view is that if B2X fails, it will be harder for future forks to gain any level of success - particularly as Bitcoin moves into second layer scaling solutions, smart contracts etc. As a result I don't see forks increasing, but decreasing.

It's certainly legit. I have one of their USD cards and it's brilliant. You simply send some bitcoin to the wallet, once funds are confirmed you can load the card - and here's the neat part, it's loaded instantly and you get a text message to confirm. You also get a text message whenever you use the card to confirm the transaction. 
As someone who recently had their Bitstamp account closed (or whatever reason, I don't know), having a service like this is of enormous value. Instead of selling bitcoin on an exchange and sending funds to a bank account via wire transfer, the whole process is now easier, quicker and no wire transfer fees. 
If you verify your identity the loading and spending limits are sufficient for anyone's purposes.
Highly recommended.

Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia are all similar with regards taxation. One being the fact you don't pay any income tax on overseas income, and the other being you don't pay capital gains tax. 
Keep in mind that most these tax rules apply to existing capital assets like shares and sometime property. So Bitcoin is a new asset class which in many cases hasn't been tested regards tax laws.

Some great stories here. 
I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010, but didn't purchase any until mid 2011 and some more at the beginning of 2013. 
I was completely sold on the monetary philosophy behind it because I had studied money for years and knew all about "money created out of nothing" and the "prison" that debt generated money creates for people.
All my life I had never been a saver - perhaps as a rejection of my Dad's Scottish upbringing and his tight (saving) money policy. He never spent a penny on himself and when he died has savings were enough to buy three houses for cash.
Bitcoin has completely sold me on the benefit of saving. A deflationary currency does this. The world is awash with debt and most people are buried in it.
We are told to spend our money to keep the economy going, but no one talks about how saving builds capital - a necessary investment for the future.
Bitcoin makes "saving great again", by its deflationary nature. This removes the need for interest on deposit (in the debt-money system) and provides a massive incentive for people to save - thereby building wealth.
I see Bitcoin as the means of emancipating the masses from debt slavery - a way forward to a much better world.

I don't believe it's "crazy hard" to get NZ citizenship. They use an evaluation system which credits you with points for various attributes - like your education, your age, your work experience, your industry classification/type etc. If you get the required minimum points you're on a home run. It's a reasonably fair system which creates a fairly equal playing field. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:41:07
My only question is, if you believe (as you state) that it "will succeed in the end", then why sell? I can only conclude that you have no such belief, or you wouldn't be selling at just the moment when the market it turning.

Got it, and it's now working for me :) 
Another question, does this update mean that someone paying for a product/service at the Payza checkout can now pay directly using Bitcoin, or must they first fund their Payza account with BTC? I ask because I receive payments via Payza.
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:46:18
It's not...
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:34:56
It's not about "selling", rather it's about when will one exchange Bitcoin for other assets. 
An example could be "I will exchange my Bitcoin for a new car".
The method of such an exchange depends on the state of the Bitcoin market at the time. 
Say in 5 year's time, it could be entirely possible to buy a car directly with Bitcoin, because the seller wants it. 
Alternatively, you may find you have to exchange some Bitcoin for fiat first, in order to buy that car.
I don't think anyone intends to hold on to Bitcoin forever, and everyone has a personal price point when they will consider exchanging Bitcoin for other tangible assets.

I also see Abra as a sort of "Trojan Horse" - in the sense that it has the potential to be huge, while running Bitcoin in the background. 
In other words, by offering a real-world solution to international remittances and transactions person-to-person, it will also expose more people to Bitcoin via the "back door". And when people see it's an appreciating currency, rather than a depreciating one, then it will compound the acceptance rate. Very exciting I think.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:56:15
Given this statement - "Cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes. There are no special tax rules for cryptocurrencies – ordinary tax rules apply" - it simply confirms that Bitcoin gains are capital gains, which are not taxed in New Zealand currently.

The big glaring error in this proposal is contained in the following quoted sentence...
"Whats the solution you ask? Simple! You let the government (thus the citizens of the country) control the money creation."
What makes anyone think government would be any more capable of controlling money creation than banks? 
The old myth that "people" somehow control government is behind this silly idea. The revolution has to be much bigger than this - money supply controlled by maths. 
There is another word for this proposal - "Social Credit" a discredited monetary theory first proposed by Major CH Douglas during the Great Depression in the UK.

To me, this illustrates the dangers of "over-security" consciousness. The passphrase on the seed recovery is not necessary in my opinion. I use Trezor and wouldn't think of enabling it. The whole point of a seed is that it can recover your balance all by itself, so adding another layer of "security" is a double-edged sword.

This is an interesting read for a couple of reasons. 
It appears that Finance Minister Varoufakis outlined such a scheme in a blog 12 months ago.
Of course a state-issued crypto-currency would have all sorts of problems long term, but may save Greece from collapse in the short term.
But in the larger scheme of things, such an "experiment" in Greece may be good for Bitcoin, raising people's awareness of this type of currency and causing people to start thinking about the idea of state-issued currencies vs the Bitcoin model.

What many people forget in this 'naming' debate is that Bitcoin is worth a lot, as evidenced by its price quoted in Bitcoin. 
If you start redefining the "price" of Bitcoin by using a smaller unit, then Bitcoin will look cheaper - which is good in some ways, but perhaps not so good in other ways. It could even be seen as a "devaluation" of Bitcoin - and be perceived as worth less.

It's not priced in because it's not a "one time" event. The date of the halving is only the start of it. What follows is approximately 4 years of 50% reduced new Bitcoin issuance. To believe one can "price in" price rises during that four years seems unrealistic to me. I'm betting on the fact that Bitcoin's price will rise beyond expectations due to this event.

I'm a long time holder since 2011 and read both bitcoin and BTC subreddits every day.
When the scaling debate first got off the ground I must admit I wasn't clear as to my own thinking or position. But over time I have firmly come down on the side that sees second layer solutions as necessary for Bitcoin's future growth and success.
As a result, I see fixing malleability as the number one priority, so as to clear the way for second layer solutions like the Lightning Network.
Segwit provides this necessary change, among other things, and I feel very strongly that Segwit needs to be deployed.
As the scaling debate has progressed I have witnessed the degeneration of rational argument into name-calling, demonising and "religious' fundamentalism - all things I hate with a passion. 
People are shouting slogans at each other, like some nasty political rally between the Republicans and Democrats (USA) or the Tories and Labour (UK). And none of this noise does anything to further Bitcoin's progress.
Clearly a path forward needs to be found and I believe the Segwit2X proposal to be the most sane and doable. More importantly, it has the majority of big players behind it.
While I can understand the frustration that has led many to push for the UASF option, personally I see this as too dangerous. Anything that risks a chain-split is potentially very damaging for Bitcoin. And the last thing we need is two versions coexisting.
As a result I see Segwit2X as the most likely and rational way forward. Yes, it may be a compromise but unless something gives, the shouting matches will continue and the science of coding will give way to religious fanaticism. 
There is also another way to look at it. If I were to imagine any scheme to undermine Bitcoin (from the powers that be), then I would employ the most effective strategy in their arsenal - "divide and rule".
What we have witnessed over these past two years in an intensification of the divide between two camps - in classic divide and rule fashion.
What's needed is not more of this, but its elimination. Moving ahead with Segwit2X will calm the waters, give everyone most of what they want, and put Bitcoin back on track again.
At the end of the day I believe Bitcoin is too significant, too revolutionary to be defeated by irrationality, and see the triumph of reason over mysticism as the final outcome.

I have thought about this myself, wondering how such a "cash-out" would work, and if banks would look aghast. Then I realised that if Bitcoin rises to its potential and we see the sort of values that some have predicted, then it's clear there will be plenty of places to spend one's bitcoins. In other words, it may not be necessary to cash-out at all, when you can buy a house, a car and literally anything you may want to purchase.

The point here, I think, is that with a distributed exchange there is no exchange company in a relationship with a bank - an account that can be closed down. If a distributed exchange builds on the peer-to-peer concept, then it will individual accounts that are involved, belonging to individual people. That is something much harder to ban.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:35:24
I think that adoption of Bitcoin will be like the adoption of cars. Once it becomes super-easy to use, it won't matter that most people don't understand it. Fact is, most people don't have a clue about current banking. If it works, and works well, people will adopt...
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:23:11
I wouldn't worry about it. Bitcoin's rising price is a very effective way for it to get attention and gain traction. It could even be said that this was part of the design - to drive adoption by appealing to people's self interest. At the end of the day, people will use Bitcoin because it works, not because they understand or believe in it. For myself, Bitcoin represents a revolution in money and I got involved early in 2012 because I saw what it represented.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:05:33
If you look at the historical charts you notice how at periods of extreme volatility and trading volume, Bitcoin climbs to new heights, then corrects. But the interesting thing is that the trend is constantly upwards. So it would appear that a period of relative calm alway precedes the next volatile movement upwards. I expect the same again in the near future.

The safest way, in my opinion, is to use the Electrum wallet. It's light and secure and has a unique feature. If you lose your computer or it crashes with your wallet, no problem. You just download Electrum again, hit "restore", enter your secret "seed" code and voila! Your bitcoins all appear in your wallet again.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:09:48
In my opinion this is the wrong question. The current monetary system is based on debt. All fiat currency is issued as debt. If every entity paid off all debts, all money would disappear. This money is created out of nothing at interest - so the bankers are clearly the ones with all the money, and continuously so.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is created without debt - no one's liability. So on this basis alone it is more egalitarian.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:03:58
