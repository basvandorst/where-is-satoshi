That would make sense as he keeps insisting I give contribute 1$ to the account.

Of course, but like the CRA and IRS scams I'm always curious how deep this rabbit hole can go.

I assumed it was something like that... this guy has a huge social media presence so I don't know why he'd bother with petty scams like this, but he's been accused of scamming before so who knows. I should block him from my Twitter account.

Not sure, I sent him an address, and he started getting antsy and asked if it was a coinbase address (I use another brokerage that's based out of Canada, and I'm not super interested in getting another brokerage account) and now he's just trying to get me to create a coinbase account and put 1$ in it.
It smells fishy... and I'm not sure I want to go through a whole bogus registration just to lead this guy on.

What's the endgame here?
Is he trying to take over the coinbase account I would create, and is it more like affiliate spam?

Someone named Trevon James he's got a youtube channel and a lot of followers, looks pretty active on Twitter.

I'll second that this is a problem, there needs to be a little more dialog accross the spectrum of Bitcoin afficionados, even with respect to the OPs post. I like Bitcoin, I buy them, mine for them (poorly but whatever) and I've been following them since I learned about them last year.
OTOH there seems to be some kind of implication that because I like this, I should also suport Austrian Economics, Ron Paul and Libertarianism, which is probably why non-Bitcoiners are looking at Bitcoin as a quasi-religious affair. So my response to this, is that yes we probably need better moderation, but we probably need to widen the scope of discussion in order to include people who are curious about it, but don't fall under traditional Libertarian definitions

You can invest any amout of money you want, you don't have buy an entire coin, so if you have $100 you want to toss in, do it.
The fact that you're aking *if* you should buy is probably an indicator that you're unsure and should do some more reading to determine your comfort levels with your potential investment.
