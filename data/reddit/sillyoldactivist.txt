I wonder if you can set a bot to sell based on a benchmark you set and buy when price goes down. Is there anything around without writing the code yourself? At the end of the day you might gain fractions of a BTC. But all together.

The way I see it: i sell one portion of my portfolio and when BTC and ETH are around 6/7 k I buy again.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:06:02
Yes. That makes sense. Thanks a lot.

That's funny. Without knowing much about investing I am doing exactly the same thing 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:08:55
Any sense

What I can't really understand is how come that both Litecoin and Heter go up and down at the same time BTC does. It looks like they don't have an autonomous life. So, I sold most of them, waited for BTC price to go under 10k and bought a bunch of bitcoin.

That's what I am doing.  But my question is whether difersyfing on crypto make any and since all crypto seem to act in unison. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:01:23
Yes he is. But I have a question. Since BTC seems to behave in unison with ETH, LTC and pretty much all other currencies, does  it make any sense to diversify your portfolio? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:16:39
agreed. in fact i am waiting BTC to go down to, say, 6000 to buy more
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:47:45
How about LTC?

I have a 100K limit too. Not a lot of money but a lot of movements. I have to say that I never had a single problem with Coinbase. So far everything went smooth and easy. But I am hearing few people describing a very different experience.

I didn't know I was a cool cat :-)

It looks like lighting network will change everything. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:50:20
100K limit! That doesn't mean you must have 100K! :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:20:24
right. but you sell to buy more at a lower level it's not a bad deal
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:39:38
So how far do yoh think it can go? I am pretty sure it will hit the 19.0000 in a couple of months. But how much more?I've seen crypto "expert" talking about 200.000 by 2021, realistic?

Libra is just a way to increase facebook power and  to address the millions who don't have a bank account. In many countries in Africa everybody own a mobile phone and Kenya, China etc. have already created virtual currencies allowing people to buy stuff pay their bills give money to another person. Facebook says Libra is or will be linked to "real assets" and thag they want Libra to be stable. I just think Libra is not a bitcoin alternative or competitor. I am not even sure it will took off. I am certainly not going to let Facebook put their nose on my spending behavior.
