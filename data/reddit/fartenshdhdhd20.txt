Actually from what i see paxful doesn't need KYC if you only trade 1500 per month, 
if you go over that then you have to sumbit docs

no they only ask for KYC if you go over 1500 USD in a month, 
for all intents and purposes you can open a new account and buy without KYC up to 1500 so what you say isnt strictly true,

except you should use paxful instead of localbitcoins as paxful lets you buy up to 1500 usd without KYC

yea its a mixed bag at times, find a good trader and stick with them/
its like having a reliable weed dealer, gold when you find them and never let them go.  lol

Pax is the best option IMO.
most liquidity and you dont need to KYC until you reach high volumes

become a trader yourself then.
surely if there is demand (you) and no supply (as you say= you can fill the market in that case

Cool story bro, I'd love to hear how you uploaded thousands of bitcoin to their site while simultaneously being blocked from the site as you live in a blocked region.
do you even see how ridiculous your complaint sounds?
what was the transaction, post the wallet address.
Oh yea you wont as you are talking out of your ass
