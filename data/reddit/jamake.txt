You should not cross cables between two PSU's. It will fry your psu or your boards because of different ground levels (black wire).

Cool. But why would you (Bob) take the long route to transact with an exchange or payment processor (Alice)? If your counterparty has no liquidity, there won't be any more liquidity by using some middleman node(s).

Isn't it a huge inconvenience that both parties need to actively participate in order to open LN channel? How do you suppose an exchange will be able to create channels with millions of addresses, spend a ton on tx fees and on top lock some btc to enable transfers towards you? Do exchanges even have enough liquidity for this?
An interactive on-demand process seems to be easy to abuse and it would not actually reduce number of transactions on blockchain if you need in total four items on the blockchain to initiate single transfer and then settle the channel.
As I have understood, LN channels are strictly between two parties and it is not possible to commit to single public channel that anyone can use it to transact with you?
However this is just an early version of LN without routing functionality. Later there could be hubs that would handle interlinking and topping up channels at their own expense (subsidized by tx fees). You would only ever need  to open a single channel to join a hub that would reach everyone with few degrees of separation.
Exchanges would have a few channels for redundancy but certainly much fewer than one per user.
However what role do private non-hub nodes fulfill in this picture? I would create my own LN node and open channel with it, then I am free to transact within LN with no further tx on blockchain. But why would there be middleman nodes when you can reach anyone directly with one hop? In TCP/IP you have devices passing your packets in physical form. LN is all software. Why can I not transact directly with Coinbase node, without Alice and Bob nodes skimming off the top?
Why would there be more than three degrees of separation? You -&gt; your node -&gt; counterparty node -&gt; counterparty.

My question was, why would my node not route directly to my final destination node? It is different from opening a channel without setting up secure node first. Does LN have routing tables and nodes do not have full knowledge of the network?

Single PSU is fine but don't overload the cables esp. with y-splitters. Each 6-pin is rated 75 watts and 8-pin 150 watts.

Thank you Bitcoin devs for taking it real slow and thinking everything through. It is not easy to build trust and legitimacy of equal caliber. The decentralized nature means they have to get it right to gain consensus in implementing features. Centralized devteam could get away with being fast and half-assed.

Well Nicehash was technically legal botnet for rent so it is not so different from his previous occupation.

This is obvious networking basics 101. Devs should pick up a book on network routing protocols and mirror the implementation for LN transactions instead of TCP packets.

You can withdraw to fiat anonymously at bitcoin atm. Keeping your funds away from banks has its benefits...

I agree 100% with this article. Most of the tokens are shitcoins that serve no reasonable purpose other than to drive up the hype and line the owners' pockets. 
Coins that focus on being currency first and foremost will be  first ones to see real adoption.

Do they deliver outside of Czech Republic?

Yeah how about some European sites? No?
