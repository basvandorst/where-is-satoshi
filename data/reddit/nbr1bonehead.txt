This. It's an important question for those new to crypto, but a large number of
BTC holders have a one coin to rule them all mentality, hence the potential ban. The down side of the more general subreddits is that you get hit by shills for favorite coins. Too bad there isn't an unbiased website that provides a breakdown of each of say the top 10 coins.

Most altcoins are scams, but to say "if it's a good enough advancement, it will make its way to bitcoin" is clearly not true. Bitcoin cannot even come to consensus with respect to block size, larger changes will be one hell of a chore. Also, Bitcoin just doesn't need huge changes to be extremely powerful. Even securing the a small portion of the bond market would increase its market cap to the moon, that that doesn't require any of the fancy add-ons/functions we're seeing in some altcoins. It just needs to be perceived as less risky and do what's it's already doing. No big changes are needed. The "one-coin is all crypto needs" mentality I think is destructive for bitcoin. It's bloating, it adds risks, as the bigger the algorithm, the more paths to security flaws. That said, and as you said, most of the altcoins are B.S. non-sense. Still, some could have useful functions that we don't need to, nor should, add to bitcoin.

For this subreddit, Ethereum fits in an odd place. Arguably it could be viewed as a competitor blockchain and thus deserves no serious attention here. But it seems the Ethereum Devs are evolving it as more of a service to any crypto holder. For example, through relays using Bitcoin to fuel Ethereum Dapps. In that respect, Ethereum is just another thing you can do now with bitcoins, which is good since evolving Bitcoin toward running Dapps independently is a much harder sell (since even block sizes get debated for months). Rootstock is hoping to Bitcoin-sidechain Ethereum-tech,  but that such an uphill battle as it will likely require a hardfork, increasing risks, and why bother if Bitcoin can be used to fuel Ethereum Dapps already without mucking up its code.

But that's not exactly my primary point because I'm not really saying he IS autistic. Rather, if Satoshi is a person, there's a reasonable chance he/she is gifted, and if he/she is not an average Joe, then we shouldn't really expect him/her to behave like one. If this guy on Newsweek is Satoshi, he didn't read like an average Joe to me.

Very good point. Here was my original thinking, and I'm curious of your take on it. For transparency I do have a modest number of shares in the company (100) so I am biased a little. But my motivation to buy those shares were based on logic. I'm curious what you think of my logic. Bitcoin is already a "high risk" investment, although that's improving daily it seems. So people invested in Bitcoin have accepted the risks because they see a high potential of reward (not just financially rewarding, but also philosophically rewarding). Neo-Bee is also high risk as it's dependent on Bitcoin and it's a start-up. However, at the same time, more than any other company I've seen, Neo-Bee is seriously trying to impact mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, which is a risks reducing mechanism. Of the companies you can currently invest in, there's simply nothing better I've seen for moving Bitcoin into the mainstream. Mining companies generate coins, but don't get new people to adopt them. Gambling companies can't be underestimated, but they don't help draw in the more conservative people in the mainstream. All these things considered, Neo-Bee is quite a gem for Bitcoin community. We're already use to risks, but this company is the best investment I see in helping reduce those risks. I wish there were more options, but at the moment, I simply see no better investment in Bitcoin than Neo-Bee.

People see different assets to cryptocurrencies. The "lack of a central entity" is less of issue for me. In fact, clearly given the current wealth distribution, bitcoin is non-government centralized. The asset for me is that it's a "lingua frana" of currency. I could technically use it anywhere, in any country, without drama. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:54:45
Agreed, but we did have a small bump, given it was modest, it seems sustained so far. Also, this is quite a bit different, in my very biased opinion. For one, Microsoft's market cap is 500x larger. Not the perfect metric, certainly, but still, this is one of the biggest players in history. Two, I really think Microsoft's news overshadowed the incredible news with Reddit. Officially hiring a "Cryptocurrency Engineer" who explicitly stated he plans to focus on Bitcoin, is quite huge. Reddit has 174 million members. If even 1% of these members starting using Bitcoin for day to day stuff on Reddit, that's pretty big!

[Here]( is a wonderful post related to your question.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:49:43
I'm just a small time investor, but if a company secures technologies and experience that are very promising and able to give someone that's start-up minded a distinct advantage over people doing it alone, they could franchise. You see this with bitcoin ATMs. People with capital, but not know all the know how, using a promising franchise-contract to move a business forward.

That auction is going to be interesting. I believe in the promise of crypto, but I'm not a person of faith. Crypto just makes sense in the long run. But will it be any of the current cryptos, no idea. My question, how much power does Moby Dick have to destroy a current currency? +42 doge

True, but I doubt they'd buy just 1. They could by 100 m฿ (d฿). It's more about getting the culture to see they don't need to buy a "full coin".
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:51:21
So let's take credit card points for example, I can cash those in, or I could use those to buy items, they are essentially a currency that I can exchange for other currencies or use for purchases, but it's a currency issued by a company, rather than by mining. It seems like regulations on handling a cryptocurrency would apply equally well to these other forms of currency.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:12:35
This is really great advice! I'm not very interested in day trading because studies have shown quite well that it just gambling, and successes are more attributed to luck than skill (for example, there's always more than one experienced whale watching and manipulating the prices). At the same time, it's like going to the casino, so the gambling aspect can be fun. I'm invested for the long haul, treating my account as both saving and checking (checking, to help make crypto an actual currency), at the same time, but I screw around with a trivial amount daily just for amusement.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:19:58
I have, but many of these are not helping Bitcoin go mainstream. Many involve mining, which is great but not what I'm looking for. I'm less concerned with getting more Bitcoin mined. I'm more concerned about getting more Bitcoin used.

Look, the coin was a either an intentional scam, or extremely poorly thought out. You give people "special money" before they have the education to understand it, and the infrastructure to spend it. That's pretty stupid, unless, unless, your intention was not to get it adopted in the first place.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:20:03
I would like them to be more transparent about who they are, but they've built a decent reputation regardless, and it's the easiest way to support Neo-Bee, so they roped my in. Also, at least from my experience, they addressed a customer service concern I had within 24 hours, which is pretty decent.

I get that, but as a modest investor, I just got very good news that improves the chance of the company's success. Even though I expect it to be slow and steady growth, I have learned that a potential source of resistance is now gone. I thought that would lead to more investing, as the future looks brighter now. But I think I see what you mean. Investors want to first hear good news from Neo-Bee directly, before they assume expansion is even possible for this company. I guess investors on average are more conservative then I realized, which is healthy.

I'm looking for businesses that more conservative people would think of as reputable and promoting Bitcoin.

It both good and bad that Bitcoin value is not blowing through the fucking roof right now. It's bad, because I want to see the value go up, and news like this is nothing short amazing with respect the future value of Bitcoin. It certain gives good reason to buy, buy, buy. But its good that we don't see that fast upswing because it means that unlike other coins, Bitcoin investors are truly becoming less reactionary with respect to good and bad news. It's like they are almost numb to it now. Which hopefully translates into slow, but consistent, growth over the year, giving me more time to put a little away each month a nice modest prices.

I asked something similar in an earlier post, but got very little feedback. Here's what I asked:
I'm very new to cryptocurrencies, but I'm amazed at what I'm learning about economics through this experiment. Even if I lost it all (which wouldn't be much), I've gain so much more. And the tipping culture I'm seeing with Doge and Bitcoin, awesome, I can't wait for that to spread far beyond Reddit's borders.
That said, I've learned about the whales of crypto and I'm curious about how much impact they can have on this economy. To learn from you, I ask, what would happen if the biggest Whales decided to cash out fully. For example, what would happen if the top two Bitcoin addresses [here]( cashed completely out? How would that compare to distribution of other popular coins, like the top 5 address of Doge noted [here]( I imagine in the very long term, the currency would withstand the storm, but not before a great deal of damage. For example, I imagine [Neo Bee]( which is gaining popularity as I write this, would be aborted right at birth. But this is just my guess, and I seriously have a lot to learn.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:44:02
That makes sense to me, but I'm curious about exactly how it would play out after such a huge cash out. For example, the Doge whales seem to be true titans compared the Bitcoin whales if I'm understanding these charts correctly (which I truly am not sure if I am as I still feel very ignorant here). But from my take on it, Bitcoin would by hurt badly, for a long time, but likely to recover, but Doge, I don't know. It could be a death sentence as the incentive to trade it or mine it will be near zero. It would be death. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:08:34
Sorry to reply again, but related to this, if NeoBee does blow up in the year ahead, which is looking pretty damn likely, will Havelock be able to handle this? No disrespect to Havelock Investments, but they appear to be a more modest operation. Could they really handle a company that has more serious global expansion? If so, would they be forced to be less anonymous, providing the transparency that NeoBee is pushing for? I've been trying to get my Havelock-based shares transferred to LMB as I'm interested in the long term and feel some concerns about the long term stability of Havelock. At the moment, I only see the LMB to Havelock option, not the reverse.

I bought when they opened because it was finally a company doing what I hope to be seeing in other countries. I posted my logic elsewhere in the thread. I'm not a day trader, but I want to support companies that can help make bitcoin mainstream, at the moment, Neo-Bee seems the best option. EDIT: I noticed I didn't answer your question.

Lets say it really is untraceable after you send it to mixer. Is it untraceable before? Also, see the linked post from the lawyer, which was an extraordinary contribution to this discussion on how it's all more complicated than it seems. From a mainstream perspective, people don't care if their money is traceable in the U.S. In fact, again from the mainstream, they want it to be traceable for accounting purposes, to make their life a little easier when it comes to balancing the books and dealing with bills and taxes. If bitcoin does not have these properties, it will make it harder, not easier, to be adopted by the mainstream. For non-mainstream purposes, this anonymity, if it exists, has advantages, I agree.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:26:17
Wow, great response. You actually touched on some of things I was trying to say, but said it better, like the FDIC insurance. These things can happen for bitcoin, they're just not there yet. I don't agree that MtGox event won't happen again, I think it will very soon because there are several other exchanges that lack serious transparencies, and now we care about that very much, so they will get called out in the months ahead. That said, it won't happen forever, after all the primary exchanges have these audits in place, MtGox events will be history, IMO. +42 doge

If you are a typical US business, why bother dealing with that process. 99.99% of US businesses only deal with US dollars. They might consider bitcoin to avoid credit card fee, but now that they also need to juggle taxes recording, they'll likely say screw that. It's not worth the time.

One way to look at it is that even if you love the technology, from an investment standpoint, there's often better options (no pun intended). For example, there are awesome tech ETFs that may include Bitcoin tech in the future, but simply not quite where it need to be to be added. Bitcoin volatility resembles a pennystock, and while some pennystocks are equally awesome if you believe in them (as Bitcoin is awesome)  they are a very risky investment. Now I'm not saying Bitcoin is a pennystock, only that it's behaved a bit like one over the last year.

I honestly doubt they're shitting themselves. Most respected investors still have little respect for bitcoin. Bitcoin is transformational, but so was Betamax. Tech comes and goes, but leaves a legacy. They don't see Bitcoin as worthy of much attention anymore, but the general technology behind it (distributed ledgers) is worthy. If it can help their bottom line, they'll considering it. Hearn mentioned they are more interested in Ethereum, maybe a fork rather than THE blockchain, in part because Bitcoin's current reputation is mud to them.

I'm interested In seeing what Rootstock looks like in the end. The Ethereum path through relays has been argued to be more empowering to Bitcoin. It's a [bonded side chain]( Both could be beneficial to Bitcoin. ETH is not being developed to replace Bitcoin.

I think Microsoft and R3 would disagree :) but who knows! Long live many chains. One chain to rule them all makes absolutely no sense to me at all. Different chains will be optimized for different functions, clearly.

Probably too late but...
I very much look forward to testing out SynapsePay. Will you have some of the cool options we can currently have with Coinbase, such as "instant purchase"? At Coinbase, that's set to $1000 per week, and I'd love to have something similar with Kraken.
Here's the deal. Coinbase is more fiat deposit friendly (currently), but only exchanges Bitcoin. Kraken is less fiat deposit friendly (currently), but has an improved range of exchanges.
If you can match Coinbase in their deposit options (such as instant purchase), then bye bye Coinbase. Similarly, if Coinbase would open their exchange to say the top 5 currencies, then bye bye Kraken. Who will move first?

No doubt

Because Bitcoin can actually use Ethereum fully (can't do that this Litecoin). A bitcoiner uses their coin bonded on Ethereum to use smart contracts then they get their coin back when done. No need to bloat Bitcoin's blockchain by adding more code. Bitcoin can stay streamlined as gold and secure, but use Ethereum for smart contract services fully empowered. Win win for both blockchains.

So from that argument, when two people get raises, neither benefit? Makes no sense.
If you're paying attention, it's clear there will be multiple blockchains, including private blockchains. Bitcoin is perfect as a gold chain. Streamline, no bloated code, no BS, exchange of value for the global public. Ethereum is designed for smart contracts, including blockchain interoperability, but larger code, less streamline, but nevertheless, a much needed resource for the future. Together, Bitcoin and Ethereum public chains cover all public use cases. There will still be other, less popular, public chains as people experiment with new ideas, or try to swindle the dumb. We're pretty much there already.
(FYI, litecoin is dying, there's maybe two dev versus ethereum's 100s, even Kraken's CEO said that lite will likely be less than a dollar at the end of the year).

They won't be able to use some features available from Ethereum's already available capacity as a [bonded sidechain](

But Ethereum actually empowers Bitcoin more than rootstock [if the current model for rootstock still holds]( I'm super excited to see what rootstock looks like in the end, but at the moment, Ethereum seems to be the stronger complement to Bitcoin. Yes, Ethereum uses a separate blockchain, but it also allows for more use cases, and still fully interoperates with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:14:24
The security flaws are one of the primary reasons Ethereum Devs opted for a separate blockchain. From what we know so far, rootstock is less secure as a sidechain.

[yup scam for sure](
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:33:01
Very relevant discussion of this [here]( Ethereum might actually benefit Bitcoin even more than Rootstock! Also, they are both functioning as sidechains,but Rootstock will have stifled interoperability among different chains, which for future scaling, will be absolutely essential.

I interested in seeing what they come up with, but from what we know right now, it has some pretty strong [weaknesses](
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:08:20
Thanks! Happy people find it useful
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:11:50
That pretty big denial there. Look, rootstock work toward a 2 way leg matters, and could work well as a pay to play service in the private sector. But for public uses, Ethereum is simply superior given all the info we have so far.
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:16:00
It's actually done from the Ethereum side. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:31:06
I look forward to seeing what they come up with but I still have not seen anyone well address the issue that there are some serious weaknesses compared to a [bonded sidechain](
