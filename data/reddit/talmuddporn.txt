This is UNACCEPTABLE! We should boy cot Antpool from now on and leave bad reviews on the appstore. Do these evil people have no conscience? What gives them the right to decidede for us not to mine our transactions? I am going to get a lawyer and sue these people. They do this on purpose to promote bcash and kill bitcoin. It's evil!

Because Satoshi loves zeros and makes everybody look for zeros all the time.

I agree, we should boycot them. How do I make sure my transactions never get mined by Antpool?

Hey your seed is talking about my life! 
Cause I **received** a message about becoming a bitcoin **pioneer**. So I decided not to **stay** on my **island** as was my **original** plan. I **enjoy**ed my last days and took a **picture** of my family. After going to the main land I was **still** **seek**ing love until I found a personal hint in the blockchain (put there by Satoshi) and started **cry**ing. while **cradle** of filth was playing on the radio.

The User Activated Fork showed us that we, the users are the ones in control of Bitcoin. Not the devs, not the miners, not the traders or the investors. The users. You and me and everybody else that draws penises on

So you are saying that ... 
Bitcoin is just a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude?
