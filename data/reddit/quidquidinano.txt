How can it be only $5 mill? BTC @ $543 x 119,000 = $64 mil?

TBH, Mr. IRS, I lost money on bitcoin this year. So may please take a tax credit?

Too many...

I believe it is instantly credited to your account and you get market rate

You should add a mining script to it to make more coins before the fork lol

My mom literally cried when she found out I traded "magic internet money".

**To clarify:**
This is a three-year snapshot of the whole crypto market cap.  Not just BTC, however, BTC is most of it. 
The point of me posting it was to show that back in 2013/2014, that first big rise in market cap value seemed to be huge. Many people believed they missed out on crypto. 
Today, the market cap looks huge as well. Many people also believe it is too late to take the dive. 
The image is representative of it is never to late because someday the first *blip* will look like today's *blip*.

TLDR: Guy buys and sells BTC as a business. Registers with FinCEN, government says he didn't. Accuses him of running an unlicensed money servicing business. Lawyer talks him into pleaing guilty, gets 4 years in prison.

This screenshot was like 3 days ago.  Only on the website though. Not on the system

I'm not referring to the ups and downs.  I am referring to the market cap as a whole and how it changed so drastically in a short time. 
But who knows? Maybe we are in for a dry spell and a flat lining around $3K. 
No one knows. 
*Except maybe Craig Wright*

Epic. Does he not believe in the internet as well?

That's a good question. If they don't disclose it beforehand, the could potentially give you below market value and call it "convenience pricing". And make a killing in markup.
