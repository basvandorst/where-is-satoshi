That's a fairly idiotic statement. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:50:05
Haha. That sucks. But moving money between two accounts in the same bank online shouldn't be an issue.

Just fill the market-sell tab with you BTC balance (and don't hit sell). It will show you're USD result.

Bad idea
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:21:22
Yeah. It is what it is. Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:58:50
NO. Only put in what you can afford to lose. Also never play with money you don't have!
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:43:55
Damn. Lol

Coinbase is having issues at the moment. Definitely called their support. I haven't had to. But good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:11:23
All words are made up. What makes them special?

I don't think they can put money on your credit card. It's not like buying merchandise or something and having a refund. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:45:09
Who knows. Definitely going to watch what happens tonight.

Owner/CEO of Berkshire Hathaway....
BRK.A (NYSE) $295,490.00
Almost 300k per share... remember that when they say BTC is a lot per coin.

That sucks. From what I hear from people in your situation I've determined that I'll just take the hit and use the card instead. I can confirm that Coinbase is fast to put money into your bank account at least. I withdrew USD and it landing I'm my bank account the same day. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:48:07
Coinbase alerts are worthless it's your expectation is real-time notification. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:11:56
Basically don't fuck yourself over. Everyone has a different income. What's better advice? Haha 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:19:20
You won't be able to get them on the exchange fast enough. The transfers to Coinbase/gdax are and will be slow. So if your concerned about loosing value you might have to keep the BTC on the exchange and be read to sell (or have stop loss order set). Also hope that there is liquidity when you try to sell.... If it's all going down there has to be someone willing to buy to get your sell order filled. No buyers mean no selling.

I'm guessing it will dip a thousand or so. Look at all the sell orders at 10k. I'll sell and buy in again at the perceived low. Then it'll jump back up. 10&gt;10.5&gt;9k&gt;11?

Buy an old 911. 1980s or 1990s turbo if you can afford it. They won't depreciate. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:51:10
I should have got in way earlier! Haha
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:45:54
Hilarious. That made my day.
