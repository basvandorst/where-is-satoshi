Segwit segregates signatures, they are still on the blockchain, outdated nodes just don't see them.
They are realtime on the chain, this is not a sidechain.

Count me in!
Here is my review:
First of all I searched "hive" and the bitcoin wallet was not the first nor the second app appearing in the search, you guys need to do more "SEO" to get a higher rank.
I love the fact that the app is only 2MB
The appeareance is a lot like the old Bitcoin Wallet for android, the one that works in SPV mode,  it definetly needs some more colour.
Also, the app is in English, I would like a Spanish translation.
There is no Pin code to lock the app, it should be implemented and forced to set up.
And there it is, the app works great.
Also, I am saying my reasons for staying clear of this app:
I love having a cross-platform wallet, it would be cool a Windows version or something via web.
Also I would like to have all the features requested above. (Lack of pin code = no security).
I feel more secure using blockchain wallet because it requieres two passwords and a pin code, maybe in Hive the password should encrypt the private keys.
Finally it should have a better design.

Ah, I dont read you correctly, the 0.01mBTC / kb fee you are talking about is the minimum **relay** fee, I mean, if you dont pay that fee the tx is not even relayed.
The fee required to be included in a block is a different one. (Believed to be 0.1mBTC by default).

It seems that you are paying a very high fee, (0.0005 btc) = 32 cents
You can change it to the "recomended one" that is 0.0001 btc = 6 cents

I am not from Barcelona but I am Spanish so I have some idea:
In barcelona you will probably find a couple of Bitcoin ATMs, a few shops/coffes accepting BTC via BitPay (maybe 20 or 30 in the city) and it might be a small local Bitcoin Community there.
TL;DR: No much bitcoin here but if you search for it you will probably find some.
This is also valid for Madrid.

1. ITS CALLED Bitcoin NOT BitCoin
2. There are not "Bitcoin accounts", just Bitcoin addresses that you can generate the ones that you want
3. All the transactions are stored in the Blockchain, if you want privacy you can create two addresses, one for public things and the other for other stuff
You can easily use "coin scramblers" to hide the origin and destination of some coins paying some fees (0.5% maybe)

The rules
To be the next owner of the Diamond, the current price is 0.01 bitcoins. After your purchase, the Diamonds worth will increase by 50% (0.005 bitcoins).
You will stay the owner until the next Diamond buyer purchases it for 0.015 bitcoins. We then will send 0.0125 bitcoins back to you. That means a 25% (0.0025 btc) profit for you.
However, the Diamond resets randomly. The odds of it reseting are 0%, so your winning odds are 100%. Should your purchase trigger a reset, you'll lose your stake and the Diamonds price goes back to 0.01 bitcoins. Please read FAQ for specific details.
What is this?
The bitcoin Diamond is an entertaining game, advertising opportunity, and a psychological experiment. You can think of it as a self-sustaining speculative bubble.
Why should I buy the Diamond?
Who wouldn't want the Diamond? Not only do you get free advertising and profit when the next buyer comes in, but you'll look cool doin it too.
How/when does the price increase?
Each time the Diamond changes owners its worth increases by 50%, rounded to 6 decimal places.
Why does the Diamond reset at all?
If it never reset, the price would go up forever. While this can be awesome to see, it would leave one gigantic loser at the end of the chain. Like any other speculative bubble, the Diamond has to collapse at some point.

Generating tons of addresses
Generating an address doesn't touch the network at all. You'd only be wasting your CPU resources and disk space.
Also, a collision is highly unlikely.
Keys are 256 bit in length and are hashed in a 160 bit address.(2^160th power) Divide it by the world population and you have about 215,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses per capita.(2.15 x 10^38)[1]
