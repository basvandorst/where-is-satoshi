"We need something independent, a store of value that is not controlled by one of those big companies. A decentralized one."
....ummm...you mean Gold?

How is Bitcoin a "good store of value" if it's price is fluctuating so violently? Wouldn't a good store of value also have a stable price to give it confidence?

Golds value isn't based on others beliefs. Its value derives from its uniqueness. It has qualities that makes it perfect for storing long term wealth safely, in a tangible, tradable, divisible form. Nothing does that better than gold. That's why it is valuable. 
Bitcoins are an attempt to solve a bunch of problems that are already in the process of being solved. People don't like that currency is inflated at will but the monetary system is changing to solve this.  Currently there is no place to store wealth long term (gold does this but it is not functioning in that role).

Wow. Im surprised you haven't been down voted for this comment. Because you are totally correct about why a currency functions well. It needs a stable value and needs to be circulating (network effect, its valued because it is used). Bitcoin currently doesn't allow for that. For bitcoin to be a good currency its value needs to be stable as well but if that was the case people wouldn't be piling their cash into it driving up its price past its inherent value (bubble territory).
Another side to this is people keep calling it a "store of value". Well its not functioning in that capacity very well either. A good store of value doesn't fluctuate rapidly either. 
As far as I can tell the only true value that cryptos offer is being able to trade online anonymously. Nothing else currently fills this role as far as I can tell. Just not sure how valuable that is.

This would actually happen if everyone bought gold.
