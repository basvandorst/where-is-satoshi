Buying shares in a bitcoin mining company is nit the same as investing directly in bitcoins. 
I have done research since i originally posted this thread and can confirm that currently there are no funds in australia that are able to buy and hold bitcoins on behalf of an investor nor can self managed super be done this way. 
Hopefully this changes soon.

Crypto to crypto is also taxed. Unfair blanket rule meant to cover all assets , since real estate n shares both are converted to fiat before being traded for other assets but crypto is a new kind of instrument a virtual one that shouldnt be taxed if not converted into fiat or goods but it unfortunately is coz they said so govt strong arming. Hopefully this is taken up by some good legal experts who could help change laws around this.

Cost of double spend is 60k so wait for confirmation in cases of purchases above 60k otherwise 0 conf is ok n financially viable for amounts under that. Look it up
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:35:01
Its not .... you cant exchange stocks for stocks they need to be converted to fiat first ...  crypto has ability to be swapped directly for other crypto without converting to fiat so its unfair them using the same blanket tax rule

Electricity for mining n coffee making tasks would be consumed separately unless the byproduct heat (which is none to minimal) from the coffee maker can be converted into mining power or from the miner into powering the coffee machine you are just inventing a case to house the two separate units is all. But all the best anyways i hope you prove this theory wrong and come up with something as i enjoy both coffee n crypto.

the 12 word phrase does not restore into any other wallets besides copay/bitpay ? try it yourself and see if your balances come across.
also their other wallet backup format the json with {stuff inside curly brackets} also does not import into any other wallet besides copay either . even if you decrypt the wallet backup and try using the xprivkey or WIF to restore.
try it first yourself and then tell me
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:25:08

What version of Electrum are you using ? I just used the latest version 2.8.3 and selected the option File - &gt; New/Restore - &gt; Standard Wallet -&gt; I already have the seed - &gt;   and selected the BIP39 seed option (as there is no Restore from TREZOR phrase option ) and without selecting the BIP39 seed option cant click next , so did select that , then pasted the seed and still it just generates a completely different addresses and shows 0 balance. 
So no it doesnt work , if you could share with me your version i could try but really there really seems to be an issue with the copay private key / seeds.

answer is mycelium wallet

answer is mycelium wallet , it is the only one that i found to accept the 12 word copay seed. electrum , jaxx , blockchain , none of these did.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:06:47
Yes if you have the 12 word seed you can restore in mycelium atleast 
Btw some copay wallet backups i just had the backup in the json format and that im yet to find another wallet that imports even after decrypting it and specifying the xprvkey or WIF keys so dont count on that {backup} yey
I love copay i just hope bitpay support and clear stance on big matters improves
