This is half of the equation. The US dollar is also literally destroyed in the hundreds of millions daily as well. All of what the Fed prints isn't new money, though they are obviously ending up net positive.
Bitcoin is currently inflating faster than the USD is (for now). Bitcoin is pegged to inflate at 3.75%. The USD has not inflated at over 3% in the last 5 years.

Government bad, free market always works.
Climate change. If the free market were left to work right now, when all science points out that we’re woefully behind on saving the planet, do you think regulation or incentives to be green as a company are bad IF they do what they’re supposed to do and quite literally keep the world (somewhat) habitable for hundreds more years?
It could literally save billions of lives, and not just those of humans.
What market incentive is there for a business to invest in green energy? And if there is, is it good enough that it happens in a timely manner?

If it's a currency, we should stop talking about it like it's a commodity, and cheering when the Fed says it's a commodity.

Sure, but businesses still lack the incentive to do anything even in the short term. I’ve barely seen businesses decide to “go green” at their own competitive cost without the government stepping in to give them any reason to. 
The free market has almost no incentive whatsoever to give a shit about the environment it’s in if it means more profit. The only reason we have clean air, unpolluted rivers and lakes, and large forests, is because the government stepped in to stop the businesses that would have taken those things for profit.
Maybe the market would have eventually figured it out, but would it be fast enough?

While governments may have an inflating currency, implying they have infinite money is entirely disingenuous and adds nothing to your argument for their pollution.


Who enforces these liabilities?


With regards to climate change? Their citizens die. Their grasslands turn to deserts. Their GDP lowers. Their economic instability gives way to revolution or to occupation. That is, the government's existence is at stake. Sure, a business' existence is at stake at some point down the road when their consumers eventually die, but it's too far down the road to be an issue.

Because ‘taxation being theft’ is the root of anarchy hypotheses, and anarchy is not what lifts everyone. It’s interesting you say legal extortion. Some people I’ve spoken with say that the “theft” is the crime and this taxes are illegal and thus the entire government is deserving of being dismantled.
Taken to its extreme, denying the government its right to have you pay for services it provides and ones that you knowingly or not utilize, the government ceases to exist in any real manner.
Humans naturally form groups and those groups require some sort of order, which comes in the form of rules. Humans naturally form governments. Even if you don’t wish to in the post-federal-govt-age, the people around you will, and you would need to be able to stop them if they threatened some aspect of your life.

This source refutes that assertion. Like I said, just admit you were wrong about that. You can still advocate for the dollar going *back* on the gold standard but you **cannot** truthfully claim that we are currently supposed to be on it and are not.

The Euro is actually a fairly terrible store of value compared to many other currencies. It has the benefit AND detriment of being backed by the Eurozone. So long as the Eurozone looks like it won't fall apart, it keeps its value, but as soon as that perception changes, its value tanks. Compare this to a single country's currency. So long as China looks strong, the Yuan is strong.

The bitcoin using electricity?
What does that have to do with the fallacious claim you made that the federal government believes the dollar is in any way related to gold.
I’m not here to debate that. That’s not what this comment chain is. This comment chain is specifically about your claim. The claim you have presented no proof for.
Whether or not I agree with the OP about bitcoin’s energy use has no bearing on the US dollar being off the gold standard because they are mutually exclusive. I also will not pull this comment chain off the rails any further than it already has.
The fact remains, your claim is incorrect on its face and has been for decades. You will win people over with bitcoin by using facts, not by making baseless claims. Bitcoin, or at least blockchain, has real value. By making ridiculous claims about fiat or governments, you push logical people away.

You're right but you're still missing the point. Without a large interconnected communications network with at least tens of thousands of users, bitcoin as a unified ledger ceases to function.

I don't think you really deserve the reply, but I've got some spare time and arguing on the internet is fun for me, so here we go.
Tesla Model S: 18,395 sold this year
Tesla Model X: 17,575 sold this year
Chevrolet Volt: 13,243 sold this year
Chevrolet Bolt: 11,807 sold this year
Let's also not consider price points. They're barely competing cars.
Model S (base trim): $65.2k
Model X (base trim): $71.3k
Volt (base trim, 2019): $34.4k
Bolt (base trim, 2019): $37.5k
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:38:48
Moving goalposts a bit early here. Do you still think the Chevy Volt and Bolt sell more than the Tesla Model S? If you do not defend that line, the rest of your argument falls beside a blatant lie.
Of course, if you were smarter, you would have pointed out that Chevrolet Volts have historically outsold the Model S itself, netting (by that same source) **139.0k** total car sales to Tesla's own **136.5k** total car sales. This doesn't hold true with your original assertion that **both** the Volt and Bolt outsell the Model S. The Bolt has a historical sales total of **35.6k**, but that's to be expected because it's new. 
Further, that's all without considering the Model X that Tesla also produces, and tends to sell quite similarly to the Model S.

Obama didn't do much for civil forfeiture, you're right. However, Holder under his administration took a first step in that direction in Jan 2015. The DOJ later continued in further restrictions to civil forfeiture, but was somewhat stymied by an executive order that allowed it against hackers, and via some bad wording, others as well.
So you're both right and wrong. His administration was beginning to work on the problem in some ways, and then also didn't. This is what is called government.

I’m not really going to answer this post point-by-point because this really would encapsulate INFLATION = BAD if it were shorter. That said, this post is basically saying GOVERNMENT = EVIL and government manages inflation so INFLATION = BAD.


Some economists literally say you should have a set inflation rate. If it was mathematically set by the government would you suddenly trust it? Don’t think so.


Money made by inflation makes its way to the economy and thus the people eventually.
The US Dollar is doing fine. It soon might not be the strongest currency in the world because the government is mismanaging it and trade wars are not easy to win.

Thanks for being a voice of reason here. The amount of times I see "INFLATION = BAD therefore DOLLAR = DEAD" is frightening and enraging. The only time inflation is bad is when it's hyper-inflation.

I agree with what you said about Spectrum, and am not arguing that point.
I don’t see much why Starlink would be *obligated* to do anything about its satellites with regards to China. There may very well be incentive to do things like censor or block its usage within China (if technically feasible), but the obligation would be an odd legal case specifically because it’s a satellite. For example, does a Starlink satellite passing over the border of China and another country have to disable its connections entirely or can it only refuse connections in China? I.e., the problem about spectrum gets used against China. If placating China harms the nearby countries’ access to Starlink, then why does China get a pass on another country’s use of its spectrum?
The receivers can also be banned within China and they continue to fight the problem with uncensored internet they’ve been fighting for years. (Though I’m sure they’ll use any and all tools at their disposal)
Shooting down the satellite though is still an act of war. Interestingly, because these satellites orbit so low, it’s not only an easier target but a less risky one for Kessler Syndrome. That is, there’s less concern from other countries for shooting it down than besides the act itself of course.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:50:27
Well.... probably not? The Outer Space Treaty, which the United States, and more importantly China, are signatories to, states that a satellite launched is bound to the country of its registry regardless of its location in space or even later when it falls back to Earth. Thus, those satellites are technically part of the United States (or other country), and shooting it down would be akin to shooting at a commercial or military target in international waters or even within a country’s borders. That is, an act of war.
Right now is there is no treaty or law restricting any sort of broadcast within another country.
Of course, China can freely decide to shoot down satellites if that’s their wish. They just have to deal with at the very best case a MASSIVE amount of scrutiny at the UN and a war at the very worst case.

I mean, the main problem is that your entirely decentralized currency is being transacted within a majority-centralized network. As the network becomes more centralized (as it inevitably will, humans suck), then the effects of a node becoming unresponsive for a certain amount of time, or being taken offline entirely (possibly via government intervention), has increasingly large effects on the network's ability to transact.
Let's say rompert.com goes offline for some reason. How many transactions have to be refunded due to inactivity? How many more hops (and fees in the future) would be added (as the network grows more centralized, this number lowers and lowers, but in a true meshnet, would almost always be &gt; 0)? How many nodes would become inaccessible to you outright?

Sorry, I got to doing some stuff around the house and wrapped back around to this discussion, and might I say what a damned good comment this is! I thank and applaud you for your work on this argument.
I agree wholeheartedly with your decentralization points with regards to bitcoin itself.
Since I’m going to be going to sleep here in a few, I’ll respond to some questions you raised below:
Re: cost of routing around (the unlikely event of) censorship: Anywhere from none (connect to some other node) to a little (raspberry pi), which is great.
Re: cost of routing around fees: slight annoyance. No big concern.
Re: collecting fees. The network would be ‘competitive’ if fees were ever of any concern. Perhaps at worst it could be annoying since you want to minimize hops to your destination, but if the fees grow large enough to matter, people will naturally set up nodes to collect them and help themselves as well.
If this was I’d award you a delta here.

I'm not arguing that centralization is necessarily "evil" or even "bad" as a general rule. It's fairly obvious centralized payment processors can process at least one order of magnitude more payments per second as compared to bitcoin right now. I'm only presenting the argument that centralization is "bad" because it goes somewhat strictly against the concept of bitcoin being *entirely trustless and decentralized*. Centralization concerns (due to large block size) are what specifically caused the bitcoin vs bitcoin cash fork, and thus I would say that centralization is an issue bitcoin people care about.


Emphasis on *valid* path. Specifically when it comes to the amount of bitcoin in your channel. Again, not a huge concern here.
Also that "refunded" bit was when a node shuts down, the channels settle, and if you can't route a payment, it's "refunded" or, better put, "never goes through."
My main thrust is that I *believe*, and I'd love to be proven wrong, that human nature, and the nature of the system will lead to widespread centralization of the network. Note: this doesn't mean every transaction will go through ONE node, just that &gt;70% of transactions will go through &lt;1% of the nodes. (the pdf on the lightning network site even refers to the network as a hub-and-spoke system). Perhaps I should revise what I said. Perhaps bitcoin **can** scale on the lightning network, but I have one primary question for that.
Should we allow the lightning network to be our main method of scaling? IF bitcoin via LN is going to be used to allow shops to sell products in a timely fashion, and IF these transactions are going to be the bulk of transactions happening for bitcoin (even if off-chain), and IF the network centralizes further, then we have effectively discarded decentralization from the vast majority of bitcoin transfers.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:55:25
Just because it’s expensive does not make it not a free market. Government regulation and licensure is definitely a damper but having a free market does not mean having a 100% unregulated free market.
For example, it is possible for a company that wants to compete in this market to simply launch somewhere that government regulation doesn’t or barely exists.
And even then, if I’m wrong and it’s too expensive right now, as a lot of things were in the past, then in the future the barrier to entry may well be lower and a free market can exist then.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:03:18
Sure, but if we're talking the collapse of the US government, then of course its own currency would become useless. That is one advantage of bitcoin.
Of course, that advantage is when (not if) the US government (or any government) collapses.
And even then, a government collapsing would have ripple effects on bitcoin if bitcoin were the only thing humans ever transacted in.
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:25:37
This looks centralized to me as well, and was one of the main reasons lightning is not the technology to make bitcoin scale in my opinion.
Just because something has the capability of being decentralized does not mean that it will be decentralized. For example, given time and resources and LOTS of consumers setting up connections to their neighbors, our internet could be a meshnet (or close anyway). Unfortunately, not everyone wants to do that, nor do they have the know-how or care, so people did that for them (ISPs).
Lightning will centralize over time to nodes that have big enough channel sizes over the least amount of hops.
Sure, you can set up a channel on your own and even make it private, but the vast majority of throughput on the network will be effectively centralized to some subset of nodes.
**EDIT**: For anyone about to instant-downvote this post, please look at my discussion below with u/myquidproquo. They're awesome and having a great discussion here. tl;dr of that is **Perhaps bitcoin will scale on LN just fine, but I think there's a serious cost that goes at the heart of bitcoin to pay for it**

@_date: 2013-04-21 15:42:14
I had a lengthy discussion about this with someone else because it's interesting.
We settled on defining that a person's capacity to "win" while speculating is directly correlated to every other person's win or loss states, whereas when gambling, your capacity to win or lose is either predetermined (a shuffle of a deck) or random (roulette).
To say speculating is gambling may be correct because the verb "to gamble" has also come to mean "risk wealth for gain" in general, though I'd argue if there were another term to mean that, both speculating and gambling would fall under that term.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:18:28
This is true of nearly all terms and words.
For instance, the term "decimated" was created and used due to its roots, "to reduce by one tenth." However, within 30 years of its creation (In the 17th century), its use turned to mean the same as "devastate" or "obliterate."
The vast majority of people use many (more complicated) words and terms with a "It means something like X" mentality.
