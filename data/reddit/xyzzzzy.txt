I'm not sure if I'm a noob but I definitely consider myself a casual participant. This is the first time I'm actually considering buying a hardware wallet. As long as Coinbase was acting in good faith, I was willing to accept the risk of using an exchange for the convenience. It's clear now that Coinbase has not been acting in good faith. And yes, trust is a big concern for me, and I no longer trust Coinbase.

So how many Bs would a week at a nice hotel and three nice restaurant meals a day cost me?

Thanks. So for USD about $18/night for the fancy hotel and $3.50 for the steak dinner with wine. I'll pack my bags.

You're right, I missed the decimal. But really, 10000% or 100000%, same point, which you're missing. I'm not arguing whether bitcoin will hit $500k. What I'm saying is that if it *does*, your scenario is you take those earnings and put them into *another* investment that has a similar ROI. A 10000% ROI is a once in a lifetime thing, doing that *twice* is just not going to happen.


Again you missed the point. 20% is a ridiculously good ROI and you can't expect that for one year, let alone fifteen. People seem to lose sight of that in the bitcoin bubble. A more realistic ROI is 7% real or 10% nominal. See -

I usually just let these pass but come on, man. So we're starting from the premise of $500000 coin, which means a 100000% return on investment. I'll suspend that disbelief, but




You mean *another* 100000% return on investment??


*This. Is. Not. How. Traditional. Investing. Works.* Just because we're in magical bitcoin land doesn't mean 20% is a normal ROI for "traditional" investments.
