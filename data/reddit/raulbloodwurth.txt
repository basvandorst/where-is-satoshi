Um yeah but Woz is not that kind of celebrity. He earned his reputation.

There is consensus that Trump called them either “shithole countries” or “shithouse countries.” Both are equally offensive.

Obama left the economy in a good place. Then the stock market (not the same thing as the economy) has been reacting to this + the promise of tax cuts. I honestly don’t see how Trump can be given credit here. If anything good happened, it was in spite of his bumbling stupidity.

After being evasive for a couple days both Perdue and Cotton were said to hear “shithouse” according to “White House officials.”
Regarding the cabinet members I don’t think trump continues employing people who contradict him.
Edit: Cotton and Purdue were not on record.

So if I ever get a video recording of Trump saying “shithole” or “shithouse” you owe me 0.05BTC. 
The guy cannot shut his pie hole so there is a chance.

Trump’s impeachment in 2019 is going to be a ratings bonanza.

In 2013 the shutdown sunk the value of the dollar. Hence the BTC/USD ratio increased and affected all the other trading pairs. Although the market now is a lot bigger and more liquid than 2013, any huge change in a primary reserve currency like USD will affect BTC. 
I am puzzled why people here are so adamant that the shutdown would have no effect.

Whatever man….Japan and US both consider crypto profits as earned income that is taxable. South Korea is likely to follow suit, then the world…except those who ban it.
I feel like the people for mass adoption are like the dog that finally catches the car. Except once the dog achieves his goal, the owner of the car (i.e. governments) steps out and blows the dog’s brains out with a shotgun.
Mass adoption is not something that can be achieved with a technical fix like big blocks. There are multiple layers of wet code that need to be fixed. Some people in BTC seem to realize that and are doing the work (Andreas for example), while BCH is still just the dog trying to catch the car.

From my understanding BTC devs put higher priority on censorship resistance and decentralization at the short-term expense of payment throughput. As the premiere cryptocurrency they are fighting much larger battles against governments and banks (and miners sponsored by governments) that want to see the whole space fail or be co-opted. So if BTC devs need to make it a safe store of value while the second layer is built out then so be it. Other cryptos like BCH, LTC and many others will gain marketshare in the payment space and that is totally fine by me. And if they surpass BTC I think they will quickly realize how uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. I just hate the animosity because it divides the cryptocommunity at a time when external powers are going to do their best to sink the entire space.

That’s a good idea, except that crypto is presently regulated as a commodity in most countries. So if my understanding is correct (I am not an accountant) a person will have to pay capital gains on these transactions.

Low tx fees are nice, but most people came to crypto via speculation. Until BCH price stabilizes I don’t see regular people using it as cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:41:39
Not a fan of BCH, but this animosity is no good. Live and let live. Make BTC better.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:56:27
I thought we banned all the BCH heathens from this sub? j/k :-)
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:17:15
Most people don’t have the youth and/or earning potential to be fomo-resistant. So speculation is a huge barrier for broad use of internet cash.

The scariest thing is that Turkish businesses have borrowed a lot of dollars. The more the lira craters makes it harder for them to pay off their loans. I was thinking that this might mirror the financial crisis that started in Thailand in ‘97. Except in this case there was never a dollar peg.

This is the ultimate test of fungibility.

Land is abundant in Australia. But zoning laws in general are designed to make land seem less abundant and inflate its price.

Snowden’s anonymous posts on Ars Technica were linked to him. If there is incentive to uncover identities, I don’t think we can trust Condé Nast to protect them.

They stopped because they didn’t want to upend the soup bowl. It suggests there is a tinge of good governance somewhere in this melee.

Both can be true. But this is one of the early battles, and the losers are going to regroup Iike OPEC in the early days.

The authority, in a selfless act of benevolence, consolidates power for the sake of efficiency for us peasants.
I don’t understand the purpose of making BCH mineable if the goal is to replicate XRP. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:31:59
I worry that BCH is too centralized. Just a few people  can issue a fork that turns off your money. At least with fiat we have a (often meaningless) vote.

Considering the existence of negative interest rates and the fact that US companies alone offshore &gt;$70 billion per year, it doesn’t seem too unbelievable that the people running Tether can find ~1 $Billion to shovel into cryptos. 
I mean, someone just paid $500 million for a cartoon funhouse Da Vinci!

Not sure why he thinks folding the DOE into the DOD makes any logical sense. Unless he is just trolling and/or doesn’t understand you need a research organization to maintain nuclear weapons...otherwise get rid of them.

Unsurprising considering that many banks in Japan are only open from 9am to 3pm (Monday-Friday).

I often wonder what Satoshi thinks about BTC and if we have become a bunch of dirty Ferengis(a la Star Trek).

It has been reported earlier that Soros and Quantum Fund invested in Overstock, and that the De Soto subsidiary specifically was mentioned. Reading the book “The Mystery of Capital” by Hernando De Soto it sounds like they are trying to use blockchain to register land in the non-Western world so people there can own their property officially. We take these systems for granted in the West (and Japan). Blockchain may be a way to codify these rules of ownership and transfer of property when governments fail.

It’s more than just electricity. Don’t forget to add the cost of all the government workers in Treasury, the office buildings, government pensions, etc.
