Do you want a repeat of the last bull run where the market sits in the shitter for a year or do you want healthy growth? Pick one.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:42:12
So any physical asset is centralized then? That isn't what centralized means. Can my gold be stolen by a 51% attack?
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:58:00
You should sell.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:03:34
What world are you living in? The people directing the price just want to make money.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:17:53
The point is that gold isn't centralized in vaults. You can put it wherever the fuck you want.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:25:17
People like you just don't get it.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:26:45
You sound like a child. You don't seem to understand how markets work. You just want a 1000X button you can press to buy a Lambo with.
If the markets rise too fast they crash hard. It's not healthy. Bitcoin is up 120% in 3 months after the most recent correction. That's great.
If that doesn't impress you... well, nobody gives a shit.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:26:06
I wouldn't mind seeing 9650 again.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:58:36
You sound dumber with every post.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:14:23
You think people are gonna give a shit about bitcoin in a hundred years?
Gold has has a track record of many millennia.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:15:46
This pretty much confirms that bitcoin will eventually fail.
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:13:01
I don’t believe that’s true.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:34:52
Further correction to $9k and then resume the uptrend. ATH by October.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:17:13
Save for a 51% attack right?
And how much of the bitcoin hashrate does China control?
The Earth is pretty fucking big by the way.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:19:06


No it couldn't.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:43:37
You’re whining like a child about the market not doing what you want. You have incredible opportunities ahead, especially considering your age, and you’re too impatient to see that. All you can do is be ahead of the game. Bitching does nothing but lead you down a path where you end up losing money because you’re impatient.
Overall there’s nothing of substance in your post. Bitcoin has been on a tear this year. It’s taking a breather. You’re acting like a spoiled brat. You don’t deserve to win quite frankly.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:08:19
You're living in a dream world. All money is fake. It either buys shit it or it doesn't.
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:42:22
I’ve never been charged that much.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:05:08
It's virtual gold. Gold's market cap is about $8 trillion. If it reaches that level it will still be under a million per bitcoin. The difference is that gold is elemental and technology becomes obsolete.
Bitcoin doesn't need childish cheerleading like yours.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:04:12
You don’t give a shit about bitcoin. You just want money NOW.
There’s nothing in your post that indicates an interest in bitcoin or in markets. You’re literally just here to whine.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:26:15


HORSE SHIT
Read this fucking thread.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:12:42
You can’t steal my gold if you can’t find it. There’s really no comparison. Gold has held value since we have record of it existing. Bitcoin is dated technology that may or may not be relevant in 50 years.
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:38:14
"Unregulated" cryptocurrencies he said. XRP will be fine.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:23:23
So Bitcoin would effectively die. You have no idea what its users would do next. 51% attacks result in stolen assets. That’s the bottom line.
You’re essentially a fanatic. It’s not healthy.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:13:20
I should know better. There are posters in that are almost identical to his. Might even be the same dude.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:32:33
But bitcoin broke out of its downtrend. The trend is currently up. There's no rational justification for your prediction.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:16:32
TFW there are copycats that are far superior at everything
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:26:09
hmm, I like it more before you said that.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:33:56
Isn't 61.8% pretty commonly recognized?
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:00:23
I moved everything off binance and wasn’t charged that much. I feel like you’re reaching for FUD.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:30:03
Maybe. Maybe not.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:07:15


That idiot just took his yacht out to do rails off stripper tits. Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:51:59
100 mil BTC is more than all the money in the world.
Stay in school kid.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:45:02
What do bankers have to do with this story besides giving you an opportunity to grandstand?
Did a banker touch your pee pee when you were a kid?
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:21:32
In what sense can’t you use XRP? Coinbase certainly allows trading it in NY.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:30:21
What about the second one about store of value?
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:05:47
I'm surprised this shite was upvoted.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:36:01
Gold is a hedge against fiat, which can be printed out of thin air. It's hard to say how gold and bitcoin will coexist. Obviously the younger generation will favor bitcoin, but bitcoin has not stood the test of time like gold, and that needs to be pointed out.
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:14:54
You think the IRS can't track your bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:07:59
$5500 won't look cheap when it hits $1200.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:38:14
I'm just a guy who realized the hodl mentality is idiotic. If there's overwhelming evidence that crypto is going down, why hold on?
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:07:15
You're just jealous of the fact that there are countless traders out there banking lately. It's so obvious.
@_date: 2019-12-21 23:18:03
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:05:58
No I didn't. This was a typical stop hunt. If you know these are coming you don't let them touch you.
You hodlers need to stop thinking everyone is losing money just because you're not trading. No need to hate just because you're missing out on profits.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:18:20
I'm not the same poster. I don't recall making that prediction 3 months ago. It's going to bounce around a lot, but we're headed to full capitulation. If you have money I would keep it handy when we hit 1k.
@_date: 2019-12-21 23:15:41
Good luck turning it into fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:41:49


This sort of rhetoric isn't productive man. 99.9999% of French people have nothing to do with unfairly extracting wealth from Africa. Something tells me you're sitting in a country whose elite and government exploit other nations.
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:56:13


Who is this XRP you speak of? Is he the masked man?
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:25:53
You said "soon" it won't be a viable investment. Now you're saying "eventually". The latter is always true.
If bitcoin goes to, let's say, 100k, it is a solid investment for everyone and will be for a while.
