A noble, libertarian, goal.  
But I think you're putting the cart before the horse.  True, if the government couldn't hand out special favors, there would be less demand to influence the system.  
Right now, the government *is* in a position to hand out special favors, and there are entrenched interests using the power of big money to keep it that way.  The Cato institute estimates about $100B a year is wasted to crony capitalism.  That's *nuts*.  
The problem is that I think you confuse the cause with the effect.  It is not big government that causes the dependence upon the funders, but the dependence upon the funders that causes the policies which lead to big government. 
So I think if you want to reduce the size of government, you need to attack this systemic corruption first, by providing an alternative to it.

No, it wouldn't, but most charities do not try to influence elections. 


The Government By the People Act is [only one of five acts]( what we endorse. Two are Republican plans, two Democratic plans, and one an independently proposed plan.  And while the Government By The People Act has the most chance of passing, Prof. Lessig is on record saying that he thinks the best method would be vouchers - though he's not picky and neither am I.

That's the cool part - we can fix this problems *without* placing additional curbs on campaign spending.  The problem isn't the money - but the things that Congresspeople must do to raise that money.  Providing an *optional, alternative* source of funds for campaigns would result in a Congress which is *free to lead*.  Or at least, get things working again.  
There are five plans on [reform.to]( you should check out (and read the full text of, if you want.)  Not *one* of them in any way shape or form limits what anyone can spend on political speech.

We'll keep working on the problem in the best way we think possible. :D

There are two assumptions you're making.  First, that citizen-funded elections can be voted out easily.  Sure, it's hard to get citizen-funded elections, but it would be politically risky - or downright stupid - to try to get rid of them once they're in place.  
With more candidates able to vote their conscience instead of "leaning towards the green," I think that citizen-funded elections will turn out to be a godsend for the very elected officials which are keeping us from passing citizen-funded elections.  
Because this is the second assumption - a reasonable one, but one which I think is wrong: that candidates WANT to participate in this corruption, that they WANT to be bastards and screw people over to get what they want. 
Maybe that's true for some, but not for all.  The problem right now is that candidates spend 30-70% of time on the phone, *telemarketing.* Being a Congressman sucks right now, and they're dialing for dollars instead of trying to actually do stuff.  So even evil sociopaths will want reform for the mere reason that it'll improve job satisfaction. 
The problem is that if they try to fix the system themselves, they end up being primary targets, (This is especially true in the Republican party) and big-money interests will attempt to replace them with someone more pliable. They are stuck in a game-theory prisoner's dilemma right now, and they need, at the very least, the political cover that the Mayday PAC can provide in order to take action.

The problem wasn't the regulations. 
The problem was that while Bitcoin is great for donating anonymously to a cause, we can't accept anonymous contributions, and with all other forms of payment (Credit Card, Paypal) online, they all have various ways to make gathering and reporting that information easier. 
The problem was that Bitcoin (unlike credit card payments) doesn't ask for your identity to make a payment.  Indeed, that's kind of the whole point of Bitcoin - that it's like cash.  
Honestly, we would have had the same trouble if we were able to somehow accept physical dollar bills online.
So credit card infrastructure was easier because we could re-use a lot of open-source code and services in order to get the site up and running, while collecting the information we needed for FEC reporting for just this purpose. We had to build the infrastructure that recorded the FEC required information, and put it in a temp database, along with a temporary amount (in USD) that was pledged. and tie it to an individual wallet, which could be tied to the pledger, wait for the pledger to actually make the payment that was in the wallet, confirm the payment was paid and that we had it in our wallet, and then send that all to our permanent database which stores information for FEC reporting.  
I didn't do any of the coding for it myself, but Aaron, who did, said it "was basically getting 8 different variables in 4 different databases and 3 different programming languages to all work together." 
Anyway, as the technology matures this will become less of an issue - this is cutting edge. 
Don't get me wrong - bitcoin is great, I love it, and it makes a hell of a lot more sense than credit card transactions.  But it's simply a matter of the technology that is a problem. 
But to get back to your sentence: 


1. McCain-Feingold has absolutely nothing to do with *reporting* requirements for PACs; only contribution limits for candidates' campaigns.  
2. I've never heard of McCain-Feingold making it difficult for smaller groups to get their voices heard. 
3. The legislation we're pushing for has no relation to contribution limits, which was the crux of McCain-Feingold.  
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:29:30
To be honest, it would have been easier for us to ignore those who wanted to contribute by bitcoin, but there were enough people asking us if they could contribute by bitcoin that we felt it was worth it to make sure that we put the infrastructure in place to make that possible.  
I actually thought (agree with us or not) that you'd like to know that one of the largest superpacs now accepts bitcoin.  And depending on how you measure "large" - we're somewhere between the AFL-CIO SuperPAC and Hillary Clinton's 2016 Leadership PAC, so yeah. 
Now, we weren't the first.  That would be Make Your Laws PAC.  But still... just putting it out there.

Citizen Funded Elections have nothing to do with the FECA either, and would work even if the FECA was repealed entirely.  Maybe you think that's a good idea - I don't - but the point is that this has nothing to do with what you're talking about. 
Libertarians have been blocked because you don't realize that the reason we have a two-party system is because we elect people under Single Member District/(either FPTP or some form of Runoff voting.)  Libertarians will always be blocked until there is electoral reform in the form of either proportional or transferable vote.  
In New Zealand, the libertarians (the ACT party) got no seats until they moved to proportional representation in 1996; they are currently part of a coalition government there.  
But in order to pass the electoral reform, they had to have good campaign finance reform laws first.  In fact, I wrote a book on this transition, and started working with the Rootstrikers because I realized that no minor party (Libertarians, Greens, whatever) will ever get any representation without electoral reform, and no electoral reform is possible until we reform the system of corruption in elections.  


In a citizen-funded election, **your** tax dollars will be going to wherever you want them.  Including to libertarian candidates.  Or you can just not participate at all.  That's fine.  Nobody can take money from you to support speech you don't support.  
Again: to reiterate - YOUR tax dollars go towards the speech you support and nobody else.  MY tax dollars go towards the speech I support and nobody else.  And if you don't want to participate, you do not have to.  
And as for the cost - the cost would be $7B to $15B a year at the high end, and the CATO institute says that we waste $100B/yr to kickbacks and crony capitalism.  It'd pay for itself and *lower* your tax burden. 
I welcome criticism.  I really do. 
But you're attacking me for supporting things I don't support, for doing things I'm not doing, for promoting ideas I'm not promoting, and for wanting things that I don't want.  I have trouble with taking you seriously.

The work I had to go through mostly dealt with figuring out a way to combine four different databases.  If we didn't have to comply with regulations, we'd had to have combined three databases.  Honestly, it wasn't the regulations that were the burden, it's the new technology. 


You are reading me incorrectly.  Candidates receive freely **given** funds only out of **willing** taxpayers' pockets.  Non-participation is an option, if you don't like it, and are not willing, you don't have to participate and no taxpayer funds will be taken from you.

Right now, the *only* way to influence policy is to spend money. 
So if we want to make *any* change to this system, we need to spend money.  
Including the change to make it so you don't need to spend gobs of money to influence policy.

Why do people think that Mayday PAC and Wolf PAC are competing against each other? 
We're not.  We're trying to achieve a short-term statutory goal while they're fighting for permanent constitutional change.  Every dollar that goes to Wolf PAC also helps the same causes as Mayday.

We can't just "copy-paste a 32bit address" because we are required by the FEC to collect information as to where the money is coming from, get the person to affirm that they're a U.S. citizen, that they own the bitcoin, etc.  *Taking the money* is easy, and if we were an outright scam, all we'd need to do is paste that 32bit address.  
*Complying with the FEC* so that we don't go to FPMITA Prison is the hard part.

Here's a two minute video. Oversimplified but the basics are there: 
None of the reforms we support would limit anyone's ability to spend money on political speech, nor would any candidate or citizen be required to participate. 
See the problem isn't that politicians are getting money from people who have political agendas; but that they're *only* getting money from people with those agendas.  Check out the Lesterland Ted Talk (although that's 20 minutes).  Even well-meaning conservatives, libertarians, liberals, and independents cannot help but to participate in this system of corruption.  
And while the people do have the ability to vote for any *viable* candidate, it is the relevant funders - the 0.05% of the population who contribute to federal campaigns - who have control over which candidates are *viable.*
All we want to do is provide an alternative to participating in this system of having to spend endless amounts of time spent raising money from a tiny number of elites.  And it's worked on the state level, in Connecticut, so we know it'll work on the federal level as well.  
Of course, just like in Connecticut, the program's opt-in only, so candidates who don't want to participate don't have to.  But merely by providing an alternative to this system of corruption, we can free up Congress to start working again. 


We raised our first $1M in the first 13 days, from 12,800+ contributors, with an average donation of &lt;$90, and a median of $50.  (The mode was $100).  We've already gotten a combined $4.5M in donations and pledges and we've only been at this two months; by comparison, "Ready for Hillary," Hillary Clinton's leadership PAC for her 2016 run - has been at this for 18 months and only raised $6M.  
It *will* take a lot of money, which is why we started this thing.  But the thing is - it's gonna cost less for us to win, because the people are with us - and we just have to keep getting the word out any way we can.

You rang? 
Yes,  and  on freenode.  
Mainly our problem is figuring out how to integrate it with our existing infrastructure for collecting the reporting information required by the FEC.

I cannot speak - nor would it be appropriate to speak - on how much the other 3 (or is it 4 now?) staffers make, but I make $4000 a month before taxes on a month-to-month contract basis, for which I work 40hrs/wk but am on-call 24/7. 
That $4000 does not include workspace (I pay $200/mo out of pocket for coworking), or health insurance (I'm on Obamacare's silver plan).  
I'm only getting paid because I have to eat and pay the mortgage - and that $4000 is about 80% of what my old salary at my last job was.  I've also had to turn down about $5000 worth of client work last month because I'm too busy with Mayday PAC stuff. 
Anyway, a full list of expenditures will come out in our FEC filing. 
You should be aware, however, that NONE of our overhead - including my paycheck - is coming out of the money donated by small dollar contributors (and all bitcoin contributors are small-dollar contributors.)  That money is coming from our matching funds from Peter Thiel (of PayPal and Facebook fame), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), the venture capitalists Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Joanne Wilson (Women Entrepreneurs Festival), Chris Anderson (TED), Vin Ryan (Iron Mountain), and David Milner. 
Prof. Lessig and the rest of the board do not get payment or compensation.

I'm sure Aaron (CTO) will have a writeup when he's not so busy, but basically, because our architecture was designed by volunteers, basically, we have to keep passing variables back and forth between different databases (one for storing the bitcoin data, one for confirming we recieved the bitcoin, one for storing the FEC data, etc) and they all seem to have been written in different languages. 
This is something we could rewrite from the ground up if we had more time, but we just didn't.
