Thank you for being a wonderful person. Please consider donating to Khan Academy: 
They accept bitcoin donations too. Check the FAQ.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:50:57
Note that Khan Academy accepts donations via Bitcoin right on their donate page (check the other ways to donate section of the FAQ)

See [this thread]( for possible risks associated with having an API key enabled.

On behalf of Khan Academy, many thanks for that! :)

As a developer at Khan Academy, I just want to say that we absolutely are a [charity]( We're also a 501c3 nonprofit.
We're lucky to have some very [generous supporters]( but we also appreciate every [bitcoin donation]( that we receive.

I'd use this if rather than an API key (which has full access to my Coinbase account), mint instead only needed an [oauth token with *balance* permissions]( It's not that I don't trust mint - I have to trust mint if I want to use it with the rest of my (stone age) banks.
But there have been [threads on reddit like this one]( that demonstrate that having an api key enabled on Coinbase is not without risk. I don't understand where the vulnerability occurred in that thread, but since there is really no reason for mint to need anything beyond balance permissions, it's a pity the current implementation requires full access.
(and yeah, I know implementing oauth can suck...)

Is this 25% discount on reddit gold permanent? If so, reddit will be one of the few "merchants" (snicker) to not only accept bitcoin, but actually encourage it by offering a discount. In theory this should happen more often if bitcoin really does turn out to reduce transaction costs for merchants, but we haven't seen much evidence of that yet.
If 25% is too much to make permanent, please consider 5% or 10% instead?

Of course the value of Coinbase will be correlated with that of bitcoin, but nonetheless I found this to be interesting info.
@_date: 2013-08-05 00:09:16
Done! Thanks for your patience.

I don't see any Khan Academy user with that email. Can you log in, then click your name at the top right of the screen, then click on the popup that comes up? That will take you to your profile. It should be a url that looks something like this: 
Yours might be much longer if you don't have a username. When you get that URL, can you send it to me?

Something weird is going on with Coinbase on this transaction. It doesn't appear to be linked to an order (which is what triggers the badge award mechanism). You did send this with the Coinbase widget, right?
I'm going to ask them to investigate, but in the meantime let me send you the badge! Send me the email address for the account you used to donate and I'll hook you up.

I made a [pull request]( for replacing the video discussed here.
@_date: 2013-08-15 09:05:56
[Try again]( this was a coinbase bug but it's now fixed!
@_date: 2013-08-02 07:31:30
Do you get any kind of error message? Or can you describe what happened in more detail?
Also, send me the email address you use on Khan Academy and I can hook you up with the badge.
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:50:12
This was a bug on Coinbase's side. They've now fixed it, so you should be able to modify the amount now. Sorry for the trouble!
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:40:46
They're now up on Khan Academy itself: 
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:08:01
I sent Mozilla an email asking them about this two weeks ago, and to offer my help (I'm the dev at Khan Academy that set up bitcoin donations).
They said they were working on it and to expect an announcement within the next few days. But that was weeks ago now. They must have ran into some kind of problem - maybe someone internal is refusing to sign off on it, etc. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-05-09 07:31:49
KA dev here. I expect the people reading to know much more about bitcoin than a lot of the people watching these videos, so I encourage you to help out answering the questions being asked below the videos!
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:03:14
There seems to be a mistake on the [plot for downloads per capita vs internet penetration]( They say the correlation is 0.7, but the graph seems to indicate there is a negative correlation!
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:23:39
Unfortunately not enough other people were interested... maybe I needed a better title.
@_date: 2013-08-03 03:32:41
Wow, thanks! This is the biggest (bitcoin) donation we've received.
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:58:16
I can also confirm - just booked 2 tickets from SF to Seattle.
It didn't make a lot of sense for me to do that however. It costs a 1% fee to fill my Coinbase wallet. But if I used my credit card, I'd get at least 1% cashback. So I just paid 2% extra to use bitcoin.
I suppose once my salary is paid in bitcoin I can avoid the 1% fee. But bitcoin can't compete with the 1% cashback unless the merchant gives a discount for bitcoin payments. I wonder if that will ever happen.

The most obvious one that springs to my mind is [Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson](
I read a over ten years ago, so I'd probably enjoy a re-read under the context of bitcoin. But the purpose of this post is to see if people have suggestions for other books I should prioritise first!
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:14:30
Hmm, it looks like BitPay is free for 501(c)(3) organisations... I'll see what I can do about this. It might take some time though. I'll be sure to post a new thread here if I get it set up.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:11:13
It sure did! But right now there's no selfish reason for me to actually pay with bitcoin, only to hold it.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:11:13
Of course not. But I wanted to know if there was any evidence supporting your statement.
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:15:26
Yeah, after I posted this I realised it could be seen as exploitative. Still, for products/services that have value based pricing (e.g. things with low marginal cost, like software), maybe there could be some good deals to be had.
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:49:30
This was indeed a coinbase issue that they've now fixed. Sorry for the trouble.
@_date: 2013-08-02 07:32:54
[We heard you]( sorry it took so long!

Why do you say they'll take a profit soon? Do you think Cameron's changed his mind since [last week's AMA](
