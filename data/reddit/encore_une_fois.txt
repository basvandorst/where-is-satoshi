No, you're confusing yourself. There is no difference between FIAT to BTC and BTC to FIAT. What you're thinking of is volume of market transactions, which doesn't have a simple, direct relationship with the rate of new BTC creation.
Creating new BTC just means new BTC are created. Exchanging fiat is separate. $400k in theoretical value may be created, as if new shares were being printed for a company every day, but that doesn't tell you that they were purchased or traded, given how bitcoins work (a miner could just as well hold them).
But yes, it does give some crude estimate of market strength because it shows that this supply hasn't overwhelmed the demand. If you want to know how much fiat is being traded, you have to sum all the markets.

How much do you know about economics? The term "disrupt" basically means "change" by my understanding in that context.

"I don't...blub...negotiate...blub...with terrists! [sic]" Yeah, I can see where that'd be harder. ;-p

Agreed. As someone who knew of it long before then, it was just fascinating to see what spikes it hit. In generic market terms, it shows the ceiling value for bitcoins is a lot higher than there was any solid evidence for prior. Which is very interesting. Doens't prove long-term viability, but it does lend some weight to the logic of what's been argued for bitcoins having a long-term deflationary trend.

Like a lot of payment services, there are many ways it can go wrong for a merchant (charge-back types of things). And a general feeling of getting bigger and decreasing customer service, etc.
Most of the people complaining about it aren't from the perspective of someone buying with it, but someone selling with it. And previously, most of the counter-arguments to things like paypal being able to freeze accounts relatively at-will and such was "well what else are you going to use instead?"

...well, you know, it doesn't have crappy visualizations for your music, or try to search your entire file system for content and those are killer features for some lusers I guess...

Is there not a circlejerk subreddit specifically for bitcoin? (inb4 ...)

I forget exactly the phrase that was used for this but I think it's "rubber hose cryptanalysis" or something. Essentially: any security system can be beaten by beating someone who can circumvent it...

I'm really not as concerned about the printing the Federal Government does for its own budget as I am about all the printing, explicit and implicit, that the Federal Reserve allow the banks to do whenever they feel like it...

He didn't make that claim. You're misinterpreting.
@_date: 2013-05-31 05:24:22
That is one possible, not entirely unreasonable inference. But it can also be interpreted as the uncontested fact that New Zealand sent police forces at  the request of the US government to arrest ...funny name.

I would gladly bet you a bitcoin against that, but I don't currently have any, nor is it practicable. Buuut, I'll bet no. This is just the opening salvo indicating the Fed is moving against bc. In my never humble opinion from the peanut gallery.

Could you expand on this for me briefly? I find it hard to imagine why bitcoin wouldn't be able to count as money? That's the route they're claiming to try regulating it, right? I mean, money laundering and such, which is essentially just to note it's within the larger basket the money is in of precious commodities.

Of course. That would be how any btc operation would be spun, regardless of whether it's directed against the currency or those operations. Not that one can so easily separate them even if one wanted to: if you buy and sell on the exchange, they could be 'dirty' bitcoins before or after you touch them, and if someone wants to, they can try to guilt-by-association the entire currency.

Here's wishing you well with all your business endeavors. ;-p
