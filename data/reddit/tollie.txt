I'll offer a 10% discount on home/office air filters. Use coupon code **r/bitcoin** at 
Disclosure: I work for an industrial filtration company that is expanding its market to consumers. We buy or build filters in the millions and I've figured out how to make it work (for us AND the consumer, hopefully) to pass along those savings and sell 1-12 at a time.
Because reddit is an informed audience, I'll add these full disclosure caveats: The discount is really for anyone who uses the code, not just those paying in btc; and the shipping price isn't shown until step two, but it's a good price -- those are limitations of Shopify, which I've settled on as my platform for various reasons.
If anyone thinks of this as spam, feel free to down-vote, but I'm legitimately a believer in ending central banking; and I believe that our filters are better quality than the ones you get at the store, for the same price or lower. Also, after a 10% discount, my margins barely account for overhead, so there's that.
I welcome all constructive feedback.

This particular aspect (consumer focused side) of our business doesn't have a physical location. The industrial side, where our filters are stored in three warehouses, has zero demand for btc, unfortunately.

It's a new site (new market for my company, as I explained above and [here]( but from the beginning I planned on accepting btc as well as USD. It's just too easy not to.

This is actually the worst "news" possible. Forbes is saying that people don't think of it as money (which is essential to meeting the definition of money), *but* the Federal Government is going to legislate it as such under the "legal tender" (AKA, central bank monopoly) laws.
It's bad news both ways.
