No, it wasn't, it is really improbable. Being really improbable that BitGo and Bitfinex were both hacked, it is obvios that just Bitfinex was hacked and that was sufficient to move the funds.
That takes us to a simple conclusion: there was no BitGo control over the number of released signatures in time. Therefore, they built a system in which it was sufficient to hack just Bitfinex to take the money. Therefore, BitGo was totally unuseful. It was just assumed to give you a false sense of security that was inconsistent.
Let me tell you something: the network does not forget. We will take actions as a consequence of such thing, e.g., by not using such services anymore at all. I personally think that the mayor responsibilities are of Bitfinex. BitGo was just asked for a signature service from Bitfinex, and they gave it to them.

I am sorry, I am new in the decentralized exchange concept. Is anyone able to explain me (or send a link that explains) how fiat transactions between users are managed? Where I put my fiat to be exchanged with BTC? How is it sent to another user?
Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:26:41
I'm really happy to see such a clear explanation, but as a bitcoin user I'm quite concerned about the way you present just positive features ignoring actual technical drawbacks. It seems that BTC is the heaven, but it's not, at least not right now.
For example, you can just lose your password to lose all your money, your wallet can be hacked and your money stolen. You have not the happy face of the guys on the website when something like that happens.
As another example, a deflationary monetary system has drawbaks that are not presented, as it can't be used alone for managing an economy. When inflation is necessary in a monetary system, it must be generated in some way, and BTC alone doesn't allow that.

The from-scratch premium for generating a new block will be 0, but the miners will continue to obtain transaction fees... so, the incentive for generating new blocks will be the transaction fees only. Total hashing power will be decreasing for sure, but the process can continue thanks to transaction fees.

Well, in fact, it is. Bandwidth must stay low for ensuring that every common person can run a full node if they want, to encouraging dencentralization.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:30:48
This is more or less equal to increasing the block size, it means more bandwidth requested for full nodes, more memory and so on...
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:44:10


Well, it depends on your bandwidth. By now, you can implement a full node with a pretty low bandwidth.
Thanks to the fact that a block is released every 10 minutes, you have just to be able to download such block in 10 minutes (plus other infos, of course). If you release blocks every 5 minutes, the *minimum requested* bandwidth, of course, more or less, doubles.

If the app company closes you can use your passphrase to recover your private keys, and private keys can be used as input of a new app to recover your BTC. IF the app is hacked your coins are stolen, so you have to use only known and open source apps as Electrum or Mycelium, or hardware wallets whose software is more unlikely to be hacked.

Have you considered the idea of contacting a lawyer?

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:58:17
You have to download an app to manage BTC on your Android phone as Mycelium, or install an app on your PC as Electrum, or buy an hardware wallet (see instructions elsewhere for them).
When you open the app, you will be given a set of words that is a passphrase. You have to be really cautious in writing in a safe place the passphrase, you will need it if you lose your phone, or your PC crashes.
Then, you have to move the money from where you have them to the app you have installed. That's it.
The passphrase you write down somewhere is a readable equivalent of your private keys. Don't show it to anyone. It is the only thing you need to spend your money.

He demonstrated that he can use his own privileges to access to personal infos as passwords and secret keys on blockchain.info, while it is the basis of every single website to not storing such information in plain text, but to save them in a cryptographic way allowing no one ever to read such information. It means that the level of security at blockchain.info is zero. No one should open up an account in a business like that.
He also lost time and reputation for just $50 (at the time), meaning that it's more important for him to childishly demonstrate that he's right (of course he was) than to run his own business for the best of it and his customers.
This is also what destroyed MtGox in the same years exactly: for two years, it was more important for the ceo to hide his responsibilities than dealing with what was inevitable and act in the best interest of his customers.
Never do business with people like that, every futile event in their life can be the cause of the ruin of a lot of people.

If the piece of news is true, it is very likely that MtGox will not allow full withdrawals of the funds immediatly, but it is probable that they will impose restrictive limits to both BTC and fiat withdrawals. That should be enough to ensure that the market will not go crazy in the short term
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:23:38


The only explanation that I can give, given the facts, is that the exchange WAS ALREADY IN BANKRUPCY. My thesis is that, for unknown reasons, MtGox lost a huge amount of bitcoins at some moment in the time before Markus activity.
Then, in order to survive and sustain BTC withdrawals, they used some of the exchange money to buy BTC in order to compensate the shortage.
If you think carefully, that's the only reasonable explanation. The only thing that does not match with that is that FIAT debts should also be very huge. I can't explain that.
But, anyway, that's a fact that collides with the bot buying bitcoins in every explanation: a huge purchase of BTC leads to high FIAT debts in any case. One of those two facts must necessarily be false.

I want, in any case, say thank you for making us notice such addresses. MtGox or not, it is impressive to notice such an amount of 1,200,000 BTC that are obviously controlled by the same entity.

@_date: 2014-02-26 14:18:11
Listen to my reasoning: Bitcoin transaction are public, and MtGox team has access to its entire transaction history.
Said so, they do know exactly who is/are the user/users who stole the money, but, also: being transactions public, they already know where the money is!
It is not a fantasy scenario to imagine that those 740.000 BTC are placed in just a few number of wallets, maybe less than 10. They exactly know where they are and they can see them! That explains what Karpeles says:
“well, technically speaking it's not 'lost' just yet, just temporarily unavailable.”
They do exactly know where they are, but they cannot take them back!
I wonder whether MtGox is planning some technical action with the collaboration of the other Bitcoin authorities in order to take the money back, is it technically possible some sort of massive attack in order to force the wallets, in your opinion? Or some different coordinated action?
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:00:59
The fact that everyone seems to ignore is that labels cannot be put by anyone, but they must be signed by the owner of the address.
What is very strange, and makes Blockchain detectives worthy of attenction, is that WHOEVER WROTE "stolen coins from mtgox" LABEL IS ALSO THE OWNER OF THE ADDRESS, the entity who can move all those bitcoins.
The address belongs to Bitstamp? If that's true, then necessarily Bitstamp is the author of the label "stolen coins from mtgox". Why to do such thing? Just an employee trolling people? I can't find an answer.

Bitcoin has value because mining bitcoin consumes energy, and energy has a value.
If I buy a mining hardware for 2000$ and consume 500$ of energy to produce 25 BTC, for example, I do not know how much is their value in the market, but surely a bitcoin has a value for me of 100$ and that value is real. That is in the sense that a single bitcoin is a number that is a sign, it stands for a real work and consumption of energy that happened somewhere in the history of the real world.

A note: if you say that "mining costs money" you do not move forward: you are saing that "bitcoin costs money", so "money costs money", that's nothing interesting.
The central fact is that mining costs energy, resources and work. Those energy, resources and work are real facts in the world, and here is the connection between astract bitcoins (that are just numbers) and real world.
When I'm giving you a bitcoin I'm giving you the consumption of effort, work and resources that once somebody did in order to create that Bitcoin. That is the only way we can confer real value to a Bitcoin. The rest are speculations, bubbles, market movements, that are abstract and not "real value".
The cost of mining does not follow the market, market and mining cost regulate each other in an adaptive manner, and this equilibrium is what in the end gives a real value to a Bitcoin. Nothing less, nothing more.

This is really a dobtful assertion. If people buy BTC, it doesn't mean that they use it. In order to measure how much it is adopted, a good measure is to count how many online shops accept BTC in terms of market volume.

No, what happened to MtGox was disclosed: a guy copied the wallet.dat file containing the private keys used by the MtGox system to save money. MtGox later started to generate new addresses, but they also  thoughtlessly continued to use the old ones. So, every time some BTC appeared in a legacy address the thief stole them.

Obtaining virtual money by mining is at the basis of the concept called Proof of Work. Solving a mining algorithm requires computational power, that implies that you use some energy (let's measure it in Joule) for generating a single coin. So, having a virtual coin means that you have the eternal and unquestionable proof that a work of X Joules has been made, and that is the real value of the coin: the unquestionable work that was done for generating it.
In such sense, virtual money is more a real money than fiat, because dollars and euros are generated from thin air nowadays (not in the past) by central banks, they have no work, nor material values behind them. On the contrary, a virtual coin generated by a system based on PoW algorithms, is a permanent store of proofs of energy spent in the past.

This is the first time we have an evident proof of the presence of a Bot controlled by the MtGox owner himself, even if it was obvious that was so, even before this article.
We are now even more sure that Willy the Bot bought BTC for money in order to re-balance losses as suggested, with Karpeles that was aware of the loss.


That don't make no sense to me. A cold storage with a minimal hot wallet was the perfect choice, why changing? 
However, a former report said that BTC were stolen from hot wallets during 2012-2013. So, in some manner, BTC were in hot wallets in such period. Is such cold wallet story wrong? Were BTC moved again to hot wallets after 2011?

I just did the same taking out BTC from Kraken today. 0.0005 ($1.30) of Kraken fee, 0.0015 ($3.8) of transaction fees.
The transaction has 2 inputs and 2 outputs, 405.728 sat/B.
