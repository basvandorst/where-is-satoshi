I think he didn't had a dick to begin with... And in 2020 he will reveal it by saying "haha jokes on u guys"... and we will be like... "no, actually not really bro. "

The problem with ppl who talk in this manner isnt the arguments... It's more the reasoning and ur agenda... U don't want to better the life of someone else u just want them to buy so the price goes up and it benefits ur assets... U can just say "buy bitcoins u fuckers I need my lambo."

I almost went all in at a price arround 5300euro last October what was thought to be the bottom, at that time the fear greed index was at 13 and there was a great sentiment and alot of news about major breakthroughs concerning adaption... Looking back this was pretty exhausting. I still choose I heart attack over supporting the current banking system.

That's why I said I am confident not I am accurate... U could simply voice ur opinion instead of saying nothing really.

If u not really need to or wasnt planing on doing so then just wait... If we really fall below 3000 u made the investment of ur life time... If we go up from here u can still get a decent amount or don't rejoin bitcoin at all if u have other business ventures in mind.

I don't think they r really aiming at bitcoin... I think Xrp is even to shady for there behalf and they want to start they own banking payment network, that would make sense... Even there tone concerning Xrp changed to the worse, I guess brad garlinghouse "r3" mess was one to many.

Im a bitcoin maximalist but still I don't want fiat to collapse... I really hope It stays stable for decades, because ppl like my parents and alot of friends of mine who r older and not wiling or able to adopte to something like cryptocurrencys in a short time frame... They would suffer under drastically changes. Coexistence for ten more years with a slowly introduction would be perfect. elderly ppl would join on there own terms just like they did with mobile phones and whatsapp... some grannys r even posting insta stories and sending snapchats arround... that's what I would call adoption.

I never said proof. I was voicing my opinion in hope of confirmation or another perspective. But nevermind my friend.

But they still don't care about an audit and possible money laundry, customer fraud, tax fraud and etc...

 it's not possible that they will approve it. this is price manipulation covered by a false narrative... Ur all getting hustled... They will pull out right before they get rejected and price will fall around 2-1,5k.
