Perhaps not the greatest way to phrase it, but the value of bitcoin is based solely on the amount of new money put into it. How much people are willing to offer for it.
Perhaps you don't need to bring in new people etc., but you're still getting rich off the backs of the hopeful dolts thinking it's going to make them rich.
And it might, as long as more and more hopeful people invest and think bitcoin has value.

They did in the Netherlands. And I think a bunch of other places as well, everywhere where banks were upheld by the government.
For example, all the people that had their savings in IceSave (Iceland based bank) got all their savings under 200.000 recuperated from the government in most of western europe. 
Privatized profits. Shared losses. It's immoral.

It's relatively simple. Since there is no inherent value to it, and as a currency it's.. unreliable at best, Bitcoin is a giant stock pyramid scheme. All the people that invest now and earn big bucks are doing so over the life savings of the people that lose it all when it eventually crashes.
Something to keep in mind as well. Unlike the other 2008 crash or the 2000 .com crash, if you lose all your savings when bitcoin crashes, you get no recuperation, a.f.a.i.k.

True, but with a company you're investing in something that can make a profit. Provide dividents. 
Bitcoin is only valuable because people see it as an investment opportunity. Very few people would see it as a great alternative for their normal daily transactions.
I liked the idea in the beginning. Applauded it. Now it seems like an investment craze which will end badly, meanwhile destroying the environment through ridiculous power usage.

True, but mass adoption by who? I've not seen anyone talk about using it in their daily life. Depositing their paycheck in bitcoin. All they do is see it as an investment, like a stock. 
I like the idea of a deregulated currency. I don't like the investment hype going on here, or the insane level of power usage that the world has to deliver to fuel it.

If people lose sight of this basic fact of currency, then we should stop pretending and treat it like a pyramid scheme. One where any increase in value has to come from suckers paying to get in, and a few lucky folks who got in early cashing out.
