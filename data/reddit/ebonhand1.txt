In a sense, there is always going to be a transitional period. We are currently in negotiations with a few different sources to secure our initial investment and we're ready to go and expect to be on property within 1 month from the date that we sign the contracts for our kick-start funding.

The notion is perfectly sane. We, as a species, have to get past our own insanity to see it. Time to put away obsolete toys and start working together towards building our future.

That, of course, is one possibility. Of course, it won't really matter because there won't be an artificial need to be super productive. Things will get done as they happen and people will generally be much happier to not be under deadlines anymore.

They do seem to be in bed together on so many levels. Its time to end the charade.

And if that works for you, then set your own schedule and hold yourself accountable to it. As for me, I don't need authority figures to watch over my shoulder to motivate me to get things done. If it is important to me then I make it happen, but if I don't get it done then I guess it really didn't matter to me in the scheme of things and I let it go. Humanity has done a good job of brainwashing itself into believing that we need overlords to babysit us, but we really don't.

Perhaps not right this moment, but if you show them what is possible...

Money is an obsolete notion. It got us this far and it did well enough for its purposes, but we've all realized now that it is a tool of artificial scarcity and enslavement to control the population.

I propose the entire charade is obsolete and there are much more efficient ways of doing things that do not enforce artificial scarcity, waste of natural resources, unnecessary starvation and death. The monetary and market system has left our planet clinging to shreds of its natural resources, covered in toxic waste, poverty, starvation, war, mass extinctions of indigenous species, genetically modified foods and genocide. Is that what you are referring to by market efficiency?

  Perhaps the problem is the notion of money in the first place. At what point was it decided that people must use money to mediate their interactions with each other? 
  At what point do you stop and look at the big picture and realize that we have sufficiently advanced technology to create abundance for all if we can all just agree to stop focusing on personal gain at the expense of others. 
Money = Debt
  That is the foundation that our entire monetary system works under. It is an empty promise used by those in control to be able to skim off the top of every transaction so they can live in opulence while the rest of us must bear the burden of keeping the whole charade afloat.

is losing money the new term for giving themselves bonuses? I bet they could save a whole ton of money if they didn't bonus themselves for failure.

the flaw in your logic is assuming that nothing can be accomplished unless there is a personal financial motive. If people grew up and realized that we can collectively accomplish so much more if we all quit worrying about what we personally are going to get out of something vs what we can accomplish as a whole. By instituting a resource based economy we can divert resources evenly to projects that are needed. I suggest checking out the principals of a resource based economy from the Venus Project:
