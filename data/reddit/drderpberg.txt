My dad knows I own a tiny bit of Bitcoin. He's actually intrigued, but encouraged me to sell at pretty close to the all-time high. I introduced him to the logic that "you can either look at it 2 ways... It's lost 25% of its value in the past weeks, or it's still up like 500% since the last time you told me it was collapsing."
Funny enough I think he got it. I put in like $60, if I can get a new car out if it I'm selling. Until then HODL.

Not to sound paranoid, but if they care it would be pretty simple to also flag cash withdrawals from nearby ATM's by people who don't live near them. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:12:50
How does the transaction work? I mean in what form does it send/give you the bitcoins, how do you pay for them, etc.?

We only need 99 more redditors to validate that it's really him and then maybe his flair can be added to the blockchain.

Admitting we have no idea doesn't make every prediction credible. It does the opposite - anyone who claims anything close to certainty is fooling themselves. Every claim one way or the other is based on speculation and not fact.

Needing patience is, in and of itself, a flaw. The flaw might or might not be a dealbreaker based on how you project its value, but if you weren't confident bitcoin would go up, saying "you can own $1000 now or buy 1 BTC worth $1000 now but which you can spend for $1000 in a few years" would be a terrible idea. The cost here is your money being locked up for a while, the benefit is expected future value. Otherwise you might as well not own any and buy it in a few years when/if it's more useful.

If you lost bitcoin to a thief, does that mean you wouldn't want the government to go after him?
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:25:26
My point is that if they care they could do it, not that they care. I don't know what they care about. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:32:50
Are you excluding things like duty/customs fees as taxes? I'm not sure I follow otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:48:53
Who would take over if they were going to start in a million-dollar hole? Wouldn't anybody looking to start an exchange want a fresh start?

If and when people use the bitcoins or turn them into cash, they would have to declare it. The government might never find out about it depending how they do it, but it would be no different than if you bought some trinket today that turned out to be worth millions through sheer dumb luck and then sold it.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:08:45
I don't know where you in particular stand, but IMO the extreme libertarians who use bitcoin because they want to hide their money and not pay tax shouldn't expect the government to save their ass. They're the ones who didn't want to give the government the resources to do anything in the first place. 
If you're a normal person who uses bitcoin but still pays their taxes, then yeah I agree with you. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:33:26
In theory there's some equilibrium. A billion-to-one bet becomes mathematically worthwhile if I'm asking you for one dollar but I'd pay out $2B. In reality nobody has any damn clue what the odds are and nobody actually knows what a fair bet would be, but if you *did* know what the chances are that Gox ever pays anything out you could establish a fair payout. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:18:42
It legitimizes it. You shouldn't have to be anti-government or need anonymity to use bitcoin if it's ever to be taken seriously. You don't hide your face when you spend cash, do you?
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:31:52
I'm not here to argue about libertarianism, but if you want recognition, it has to be useful for stuff. Whether you pay your tax bill or live in a cabin in the woods off the grid is your call.
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:26:36
In that case I'll go out on a limb and assume people who avoid paying taxes for libertarian reasons don't cut checks to the departments they do believe in.

Cool, thanks. Do you type in the address or can it scan QR codes?

Excuse me while I keel over laughing. 
Seriously though our Senate is majorly fucked. A bunch of old people given jobs for life as thank yous for favors throughout the party in power's rise. They rubber stamp everything without giving a fuck (often without reading most of the bills they're approving) and half of them are corrupt and/or don't show up.
In the US the Senate actually has some power. In Canada it's a retirement home that's supposed to offer sober second thought but is sort of a long-term game of bullshit somewhat similar to the US Supreme Court justice roulette wheel. Whichever party stays in power long enough to name the most senators ends up with (theoretically) power which never actually gets used because they do sweet fuck all. I cannot name a single time the Canadian Senate actually *did* something. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:59:20
People have trouble understanding that I dabble in it and can explain the various arguments for and against it without fully believing every single one of them. 
"One interesting use of it is that it can help transfer money without paying bank fees through the nose. Some people are using it to get their money out of countries where the economy is collapsing and there's a freeze on taking money out of the country."
"Yeah but since when do you transfer huge amounts of money from oppressed countries"
The other one that frustrates me is when I say some people think it'll replace gold but I don't, and then they lose their shit entirely explaining to me that gold is real and BTC isn't.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:55:53
[I have no idea what "type" of libertarian, but I've seen it argued a lot.]( When people refer to taxation as theft backed up by a gun, this is what they're talking about. 
I'm not saying all or even most libertarians think that way, but there are certainly a lot. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:12:22
Not every single one, but a lot do.
I'd avoid Samsung if you don't like bloat. LG's G2 has an ugly interface but is a great phone. The Nexus 5 or Moto X are the way to go, IMO. Or the Moto G if you're on a strict budget.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:46:00
Honestly it's not that simple. I'm a smart guy on the tech-savvy side (but not enough to with in the tech industry, i.e.: I've taken one programming class in my life and understand most things conceptually, but not at a nuts and bolts level) and I still struggle with finding a way to store my Bitcoin in a way that it will be retrievable and accessible but not vulnerable to a third party. 
If you know exactly what you're doing, I have no doubt Bitcoin is secure. My point though is that most people are not at the level where they could consistently act in a way that protects them to the same degree as the current banking system. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:33:18
Can't it be somewhere in between?
Everyone who thinks it will replace cash entirely is dreaming. Nobody will ever trust something so deregulated and so complicated that with one easy fuckup they can lose their life savings and have no recourse. But everyone who thinks it'll drop to zero and has no use is also wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:51:00
Thanks to you too, you've pushed me to formalize a lot of the things I kind of knew I dont understand well and I have plenty to look into now. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:24:06
Sorry for the noobish question, but what can you do with that information? All it tells you is where to find it in the blockchain, right?
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:40:47
But who will be providing the software? Not everyone has the technical skill to vet an open-source app that lets you manage your money. So if Bitcoin catches on this way there will definitely be scammers offering apps to manage your wallets that will rob you blind.
The advantage of a "bank" (as we know it now, or the same concept applied to Bitcoin) is you can trust them up to a certain amount, and know for a fact that if anything happens to your money they are the ones liable for it. No matter how good an app is or whatever, if the safety of my money depends on never getting a computer virus or maintaining perfect lab-like security (i.e.: creating paper wallets on devices that have never seen the internet) there is going to be a relatively low ceiling on the amount of money I'm wiling to put into it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:00:08
I don't think it can be fixed without essentially recreating a banking system. Most people will need a third party that they trust to hold the actual private keys to all their possessions, whether that be exchanges or banks themselves or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:46:19
True... I got in in 2013, was tipped about 0.12BTC thanks to reddit and bought an extra 0.6 to play around with. Kicking myself for not having bought more, but then again right now I could buy more and I'm thinking "well what if 2800 really is the peak?". Exact same dilemma I was in 4 years ago, only now I'm tempted to cash out and buy half a laptop instead of cashing out to buy maybe a set of nice earbuds like I was when my 0.18btc hit like $160.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:26:20
Honestly I'm not an expert so maybe these aren't all bulletproof arguments, but at the very least it shows how complicated it is for an average person to have significant amounts of Bitcoin:
* You don't need to back up a bank account. Most people don't even back up their computer, is it really fair to expect them to back up their secret words and so on? All most people need to do is buy a $200 external hard drive and copy paste their entire hard drive every month or so. Almost nobody does it.
* If someone dies or can no longer handle their accounts themselves, you can simply go to the bank and show the death certificate along with a copy of the will (confirming you're the executor) and the bank will give you access to all their accounts. There is no equivalent with Bitcoin - you either have to essentially equip anybody who has your will to rob you. Might as well leave all your money in cash in a box somewhere and the will could just say where the box is. 
* You still need to trust the hardware wallet itself. How's an average person supposed to vet a company producing a product they're going to put their life's savings in? How do you know it doesn't have any backdoors or security flaws?

Quick, somebody tell the trans people they don't get rights until they stop grossing out this guy on the internet. 
Protip: feel however you want, but don't think that has any more bearing on what rights they should have than if somebody was grossed out about you.  That's the basis of a free society.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:29:31
If you download the wrong thing on Bit Torrent you lose whatever you've done since you last backed up your computer. If you fuck up with Bitcoin that wallet is gone. 
So if you're saving for retirement are you going to keep track of 100 wallets with a few grand each, or risk massive amounts of money on your printer never having been connected to the Internet?
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:41:26
That's not really any different than a decision to not buy that much Bitcoin with money at any point. 
"Haha that guy traded 1000 Bitcoin for a pizza" ... Yeah but I could've eaten one less pizza and bought 1000 Bitcoin, but didn't. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:23:44
Why do they care? You give them money, they give it back to you when you want it. Shouldn't be that complicated. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:41:10
I was wondering the same thing, I'm a Bitcoin noob but I thought transaction delays were becoming a huge issue. 
How long does it take to process something like this? And what kind of fees are associated to it?
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:22:33
I don't think you've really taken into account scale. If there's a "bail-in" your fiat doesn't become worthless. Bitcoin may never hit 0 but hitting 0 is a poor measurement of real safety. 
There's also the risk that a better cryptocurrency could replace it. Seems unlikely but there's no reason why the cryptocurrency that catches on has to be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:58:43
Neat, thanks. I thought some transactions had started taking days, but was that just when Bitcoin was crashing/spiking like crazy?
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:56:10
Do you actually think bitcoin is safer than, say, the US dollar?
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:57:58
The point is that there are huge drops hidden by the arbitrary timelines. Over 2 years the data looks pretty good. Over a year and a half it looks pretty terrible. 
Either way there's no perfect "up X% over Y time period," but IMO the issue is whether the $1200 BTC was a blip that never should have happened or a significant high water mark followed by a decline. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:31:45
Screw mining, if I'd known in March that the price of bitcoin was going to hit $1200 US I would've invested my life savings and retired 10 years earlier.

The Moto G is the best value on the market. The Nexus 5 is the 2nd best value but a much better phone overall. Either one is awesome.

How much was gold worth before people realized it was rust-proof, beautiful, nearly infinitely malleable, and could be stretched into sheets a few molecules thick for various purposes?
I won't claim to know the future of bitcoin, but if something is a resource of unknown utility it makes sense that the first people to speculate on it would be very tentative. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:42:16
I can only speak for myself, but I'm somewhat scared off by the volatility. For the same rate of growth I'd prefer a straighter line than wild days of +/-50% swings. Less volatility gives less impression that it could suddenly become worthless. 
With the current volatility, I'm encouraged to own only the amount I think I'll spend soon or what I can lose. I wouldn't put significant savings into bitcoin.
