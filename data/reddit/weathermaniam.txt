It’s about half a billion $ to buy a Etherium if you want the same % of the supply as buying one bitcoin.

I would like it to be implemented in bitcoin core.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:42:03
Ok, well I guess I just have to start from scratch anyway.
@_date: 2019-10-16 14:04:57
Good points, but what is it worth to an attacker. Causing you 200k in damage by leaking your contacts to a competitor isn't as attractive as walking away with 20k in cash without the risk and hassles of extorting you or making a deal with a competitor. Also 20k might not feel like much, but if bitcoin does what many of us expect you will need to secure 2M soon and its better to do that before the attackers value it as highly.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:33:42
Excellent. Maybe that means it is a bad idea and I should drop it. Do you have a link to the previous discussion or know what it was called so I can search for it?
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:31:30
This is for writing down and importing your private keys (secret stuff) not you address (public place to send bitcoin). But I wouldn't recommend trusting google with 20k in bitcoin - it will likely be stolen.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:14:44
That's not how open source usually works. Good ideas are implemented and bad ones rejected no matter the source. And good grief - seniority as a criteria is for trade unions not for security software.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:16:36
That said, at this stage, I'm really just looking for people to help me identify ways to improve it or reasons it isn't needed and should be killed. I know its a long process to add a feature to bitcoin core with many more important features on the horizon.

It’s a summary of the doc. Did you open it? Have questions or concerns?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:40:27
For a more wholistic list of bitcoin threats and solutions check out btcThreats.com. And if you find anything missing let us know and it will be updated.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:11:30
Totally agree. But the purpose of this doc is to help everyone understand that it's an expected part of Bitcoin. It's possible to do, but the attackers get poor at a pretty good clip and lightning, etc will make it even more unimportant.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:37:10
Love any feedback or insights on this. I think it is a significant improvement over the idea of assassination politics. Any suggested reading will be followed up on!
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:53:40
Competition always follows profits. Be patient. Also, consider the possibility that it hasn’t been a profitable enough business to bring in competition (yet).
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:28
Remember not to share you're private keys with anyone. If you keep your Bitcoin on an exchange you are likely to get Goxed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:19:49
Ok, the memes are gone. Thanks for the feedback (even if it was harsh yo!)
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:54
Ya, I was very conflicted about the memes. We are brainstorming how to better present it now, but the content is very good, no?

If you are wondering why you sometimes have to pay high fees for a bitcoin transaction - this is the reason.
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:32:17
One reason to write down the private keys or xpriv (or in the case of bip39 seed words) is that electronic storage isnt as trustworthy as paper yet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:46:17
There is a long standing affinity between Austrian economists and Calvinist. Calvinist, like myself, are the only freaks that don’t believe in free will (the idea that you can choose to do something you don’t want to do is nonsense to us). Austrian economics is based on the idea that humans always act to improve their position (they never act against their own will). This was the core fight of the reformation (Luther’s major fight with the apologist for the establishment is titled “the bondage of the will”).
Or it could be just a reference to fighting corruption against overwhelming odds.

One name we kicked around was OhFork.it, but cooler heads prevailed :]
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:13:14
Yes, but if we help people understand it we will make it a less effective attack. It wont generate as much FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:01:21
Don’t you think they will want to spend it right away? If so, save on fees and hassle and give paper cash.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:20:31
Like I said 2 possible reasons. 1. They are on the way because his profits make them want to get involved, but it takes time to get in the game. 2. His profits are not good and they don't want in the game.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:37:35
That’s by design. In fact you can’t make a “profit” in any endeavor without inside knowledge. Miners have two roles:
1. As miners they run equipment that serves the network. And they will get paid market rate for their labor.
2. As speculators they will be rewarded in profit if they know more than the market. If everyone thinks bitcoin is going to $7000 in a year they will invest in mining equipment accordingly. If a particular miner has some special insight that it will go to $9000 in a year he will invest more aggressively in mining hardware.
In the second case he could also profit by letting someone else do the labor of mining and speculate by purchasing bitcoin. If he knows more than the market he is rewarded. If not he wrong he is punished.
So it is an economic truth that “mining” can’t be profitable. But maybe it’s high paying labor.

I think Craig and Co intentionally make claims that can be disproved to distract talented Bitcoin devs and to scare away any thinking people so he can feast on the hapless that remain in his circle. I’m certain he’s not doing it just for fame. Im certain there is a dirty business model in play.

Socialism is when the state "owns" everything. In other words they decide how things are used. The fact, that in many cases, the original owners were left in place to manage the resources on behalf of the government did mean that the system collapsed more slowly (because the previous owners kept things maintained a little better because they expected they might get it back if Hitler failed), but it doesn't change who had the power to allocate resources. Not individuals - the government.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:53:27
Yes, ignore the drama and work. And if you are in an environment that is more a result of government favors (big companies get a lot of hand-outs) than providing for consumers ESCAPE. You've been tricked into working for the DMV.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:58:24
Investors set value. Miners can’t afford not to mine the most profitable coin.So Holders matter. Miners will obey or go broke and sell their gear to someone that will.
The market always wins.

Getting Hitler to throw the game
To illustrate this let’s imagine that we live in Germany in 1932. Hitler is about to rise to power and it is clear to many that he intends to establish socialist slavery. But unlike the real 1932, let’s assume Bitcoin is available and commonly used for anonymous gambling. Wealthy factory owners can be sure that Hitler will steal their stuff as soon as he can. In repsonse they buy an insurance policy. Many of them place a bet that Hitler will become Chancellor before the end of the year.
At first this would seem like a foolish bet. Everyone can tell that he will become Chancellor. But this bet creates an unexpected incentive...
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:26:03
The correct answer requires that you know the value of the asset. Without that you don’t know if you are getting a deal or overpaying....
and that’s when everyone wakes up from their dose and asks “so does that mean sell?”
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:34:44
Another great example of how the market takes from the foolish and gives to the wise.
If you are not a tech expert you better be good at finding out who is. Fortunately it’s pretty obvious so far.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:44:32
This is a perfect analogy. Except Farrari wouldn’t be dumb enough to lose sleep over this “competition.” They might ask the state to change the manufacture with fraud and then move on. We should expect no such support and just move on.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:40:10
The name isn’t defendable. The sooner investors that are so stupid they rely on the branding become poor the better. I’m not convinced there are that many of them, but we should abandon this front and focus on building a better asset.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:54:29
One way to attack a community is through exhaustion. Constantly hit it with attacks (the stupider the better) to keep it from being effective.
 The trick is to keep people in conflict (monkey brain) mode so they can’t work on hard problems.

Maybe a good way for Amazon to renegotiate their visa fees? That’s what I’d do.
Agreed that the network isn’t ready for amazon. Good point.

This is part 1 in my series, Bitcoin, the real Great Emancipator.
The series is a survey of the major types of human slavery, and how Bitcoin disrupts these repulsive institutions.
In Part 1 we will establish a solid definition for slavery and an approach for dissecting and evaluating each type.

Not really. It will become a common store of value as more people learn about it, but markets are great at communicating value.
Once everyone owns it, and only then, will it need to work as an easy medium of exchange. And the long pole isn’t the technology.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:36:41
Technical progress always serves the masses. And always disproportionately more than the elites (they’ve always had nice clothes and full bellies).
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:41:36
The state creates more inequality and bitcoin fights that. For example the Trust busting was done on behalf of companies that wanted less competition. It was done because prices were dropping too fast for elites to retain power.
And they still continue that tired narrative that’s been long debunked that it was done “for the people.”
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:51:21
The price increases pound the reality into their brain. Eventually it’s obvious that if you have savings bitcoin is where you store it.
