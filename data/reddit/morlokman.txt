Thank you, Franko-san.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:07:45
I totally agree with you! As a two-person company we have to choose carefully where we spend our time. We'll get there as soon as we can!
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:43:03
Thanks for the good words, totally appreciate it!

Nick, thanks for the fantastic feedback—and I'm so glad to hear that you're enjoying your Confidant. It means a lot to us. (My co-founder Adam is posting as zuji1022.) 
Thanks for also throwing in some life advice. You're absolutely right, there's nothing like setting time aside to manually put thoughts to paper. Like you, I have a stack of notebooks that has been growing since I was younger, and they're a joy to go through. It's a personal experience, like a kind of gift you give your future self. 
Hope you continue to enjoy the books!

Baron Fig launched in March using the Squarespace platform. We immediately inquired about Bitcoin integration, after several months it became clear that it wasn't happening any time soon. So we redid the site from the ground up using Shopify, who has BitPay integration.
Now it's just a matter of hoping BitPay improves their checkout process. Ideally the user experience is ultra simple, so that non-BTC users will still be able to understand what's going on. Here are my thoughts on BitPay's experience from elsewhere in this thread:




Hope that helps!

Well said. For future reference: our dot grid is 5mm spacing, and the ruled is 7mm spacing. 
Great suggestion re. the perforated signature. Placing it in the center will likely lead to a more structurally sound binding, but as you said, it can be awkward. So far we haven't had any complaints, which is fantastic—we'll keep this in mind! 
PS. Awesome that you grew up working in a bindery. I wish I'd experienced that. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:20:58
Agreed. Apple's greatest asset isn't their technology or products, it's their dedicated audience. We can call them "fanboys" or "loyalists", depending on perspective, but in the end they take the company to the next level.
In the same way that developer-created apps fuel the breadth of capabilities for iPad, iPhone, etc., the dedicated followers will fuel the growth of NFC as a standard form of payment. 
Only time will tell, but I wouldn't dismiss NFC just because Google couldn't pull it off in the past.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:16:41
Thanks for the good words!
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:33:56
Awesome, thanks!

We have to go through 2 to get to 3. ;)

Fantastic question. At first it may seem easy—just print a stamp and throw it in the mail! But there's a lot that goes into launching in countries that aren't primarily English speaking. 
For starters, we have to translate the whole site into Japanese. Then we have to figure out the best way to ship there—this not only means the type of mail (priority, UPS, FedEx, etc.), but also the location of our warehouse that serves the country. After that, we have to hire customer service people who can speak the language (right now Adam and I do it) in case there are any problems. Once all that's done, *then* we can launch in Japan!
I hope that explanation helps. It may seem easy, but there's a lot of background things going on that aren't apparent. If you have more Q's feel free to ask away!

From the beginning we've been committed to offering a high quality notebook at a more affordable price than comparable notebooks currently available. After talking with manufacturers all over the world, we've partnered with an amazing team in China that helps us meet this goal. 
Our top priority is that the people we partner with 1) extend our ethical values to their own workplace, 2) believe in the mission of Baron Fig, and 3) are as passionate about quality as we are. We regularly visit our current and potential partners in-person to make sure the above tenets are adhered to.
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:02:17
With you 100% on this. Not sure why it hasn't happened, hopefully their other customers are also asking for it on their sites. Little by little. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:54:21
Nick, thanks for the props! Glad to see your classmates are also digging the books. As far as colors, your feedback is definitely being heard. ;)
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:08:07
Other founder, Joey, here. On top of what Adam (zuji1022) mentioned, another unexpected benefit of incorporating Bitcoin into our business is that it acts as a filter.
It's not 100%, but taking note of whether or not a potential partner has BTC integration is a good gauge of how forward-thinking they are. As a young business, we have a lot of road ahead of us (hopefully), so it's great when we can partner with guys who are thinking ahead.
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:40:04
Hey, ultimatepoker, thanks for the Q. Here's my response to a similar comment:






Hope that sheds some light on the subject.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:48:45
It really was. It wasn't just people buying and selling, but walking around and talking about everything bitcoin. The conversations were great. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:14:40
Good Q! We just launched in March, and we're working slowly on expanding our shipping capabilities. Back on day one we were only shipping to 1 country. Since then we've expanded to 17, and we're going to slowly keep expanding. Hope that helps! 
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:36:50
Sure thing! (Answer taken from elsewhere in the thread.)

Thanks! Hope you get a chance to give one a go.

Glad you like the books! We'll get there eventually. :)

Awesome! Glad to be present. :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:01:46
Good Q! Coinbase (what we're using for the workaround pages) doesn't give us the ability to customize the shipping cost based on location. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:26:55
Thanks! ;)
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:39:12
Thanks for the Q! I might as well mention all the countries that we ship to in case anyone else is looking for the info.
We currently ship to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, Israel, Belgium, New Zealand, Finland, and Portugal. It's $6.95 to ship a 1lb Confidant notebook, thanks to a little perseverance (and a road trip) to find partners that would ship a heavy book for a fair price. 
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:59:35
Thanks! We're working on making this more dynamic in the future. Hope you enjoy the books!
@_date: 2014-09-17 10:51:31
In my extremely biased opinion (co-founder), that's a great idea! ;) But really—thanks for the support. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:02:54
Glad to help—good luck!
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:27:06
Joey here. I remember your call! Thanks again for the props—hope you enjoy using the notebook. :)
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:55:26
Thanks for the support, hope you enjoy using them! I love the sound of bitcoin warriors—sounds like I need to go out and get a suit of armor with a QR code on my shield. ;)
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:41:52
Nice! We deal with the ancient technologies of paper and pencil. :)
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:57:04
Wow, thanks a ton for the love! I hope you already have a Confidant notebook, if not we can't accept accept BTC for nothing!
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:02:24
Awesome, thanks for the encouraging words! Hope you enjoy using it. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:46:53
Right now the majority of our income is through fiat, so we spend that first when we have to pay suppliers, contractors, services, etc. We always check to see if partners accept BTC first, and we usually talk to someone to double check. If they accept it, we use it.
Long story short: We use fiat to pay those who accept fiat, and use BTC to pay those who accept BTC.
Hope that makes sense—thanks for the purchase!
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:19:10
Co-founder Joey here. We do indeed HODL our coins. Hope you guys like the books, we're here if you have questions or suggestions on how we can make things even better.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:39:46
Thanks for the feedback, hope you enjoy the books! Glad checkout was a breeze. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:48:31
Thanks for the kind words! As far as the Poster Project goes, it was a fantastic journey through and through—stay on the lookout for interesting things next year. ;)

Good Q! Our dot grid spacing is 0.5cm. Hope that helps. :)

As a 2-man startup, Adam and I wear a lot of hats. My specialty is design, his is finance—but we have a lot of crossover in terms of making sure we're both thinking about things right. And we do everything else!
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:58:05
Thanks for the comment! Our point is not that we hold it as a speculative investment, but that we don't immediately convert it to fiat. We hold BTC—and use it. Here's my comment from elsewhere in the thread:




Hope that makes sense!
@_date: 2014-12-02 13:51:44
Joey here, Adam's co-founder. Thanks again for the bitcoin support and advice over the past few months. It's definitely helped us reorient our efforts and get on the right platform. 
edit: Feel free to ask us any questions you may have. There might be a few things we've learned on the way that can be helpful to others.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:34:09
PS. Adam edited the OP to include our wallet address.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:35:37
Thanks for the good wishes. ;)
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:02:11
Right on. We always mention Bitcoin to our suppliers and collaborators. Even if they don't accept it, we're raising awareness. And if they do accept—awesome. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:11:24
Nice! Hope you enjoy using them. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:41:11
1 book to Germany is $6.95! ;)
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:57:17
That's great, thank you for letting us know. It should be painless!
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:41:06
Thanks! I can't wait to compile these and send them over to the Squarespace team. Hopefully they can show it to the higher ups and get the go ahead to integrate. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:45:42
Adam (u/zuji1022) can answer this question on a more technical level. For me, I support the idea of a decentralized open source currency that isn't under the thumbs of the ruling class. It's an exciting fundamental shift in how currency can move forward. I love it. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:34:13
Should be less than a month! They moved like hotcakes—we didn't expect the ruled ones to be so popular. Thanks for holding in there, totally appreciate the patience.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:03:40
We're a 5 minute walk from any of the first stops in Queens. Come by if you're in the area!
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:40:35
Thanks for the Q! When we first started Baron Fig we didn't design the Confidant with fountain pens in mind. Our main goal was to make a book that facilitated ideation. 
Turns out, however, that the paper we decided to go with is fp friendly. A happy accident. :) 
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:09:21
Sounds good, looking forward to it. :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:00:31
Thanks for the support! We appreciate it. Can't wait to actually start accepting bitcoin as part of the current system.
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:28:49
Awesome, glad to help.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:32:54
You're absolutely right! We hold our coins—until we can spend them as BTC. :) Here's my comment from elsewhere in the thread:




Hope that makes sense!
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:43:58
We launched just over 3 months ago. We'll get there!
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:23:04
Yes! You can [pre order a ruled notebook right here &gt;](

@_date: 2014-09-16 14:22:11
Wow, 6–7 minutes? That's not good. We'll take a look at this.
Does anyone have experience with this issue? We checked BitPay, it looks like we're setting things correctly. I'd expect it to literally take 6–7 *seconds*, not minutes. 
Glad you like the notebooks!
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:38:12
Double win!
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:18:53
Thanks! If Squarespace had the option we would've launched it on day 1. I understand that they have a limited amount of resources and people, hopefully more tangible proof will help them prioritize allowing BTC transactions.
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:04:23
Glad you like the videos! What particular part of the process would you like to see? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:28:31
Great question. I had to really sit back and mull this one over. I'll give it a shot. Keep in mind I'm the design half of Baron Fig; Adam (zuji1022) is the finance half. 
From the perspective of user experience, I think Bitcoin still has a ways to go. The BitPay checkout isn't instantly understandable for those that aren't familiar with BTC. Our biggest obstacle will be integrating a Bitcoin checkout process that is not only quick and seamless, but also braindead simple. I don't want the user to have to think. (Bitcoin as a whole needs a UX improvement.)
The difficulty in that, then, is we don't actually have any control over BitPay's checkout screen. We can email them, send requests and suggestions—but ultimately we have to cross our fingers that someone gets it *right*.
Little by little, we'll get there.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:42:53
Same here. Before using Squarespace I didn't know how to code at all. Little by little I learned as I needed to make tweaks. Now I feel like I'm ready to move on to the next, more customizable step.  
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:34:30
Excellent, thanks for the love—hope she enjoys using it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:00:48
Your story sounds like the plot to a movie that I'd love to watch. Thanks again for sharing. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:39:30
We're with you on that. We'll see how things play out, but so far they're not really saying anything. Shopify introduced bitcoin transactions last November—it's getting harder to keep telling myself they'll do it any day now!
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:19:42
In the meantime, [this will have to do.](
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:33:59
Another Fig-ite appears! Thanks for the love. :)
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:42:18
Awesome, thanks! How was the checkout experience? A redditor above mentioned that it took 6–7 minutes to process—did you have the same issue? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:12:48
Awesome. Thanks for the feedback! Duly noted. ;)

Co-founder Joey here, thanks again for the support over the last year. Adam's background is in finance, and he's been heavily into bitcoin since the beginning. Hearing him talk about it so passionately has converted me into a believer as well. Hope you guys like the books, and I hope his efforts in making the integration work properly benefit the community as a whole.
