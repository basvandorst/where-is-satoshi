A new coin from the up coming fork in Nov.
The ratio is 1:1 just like the bitcoin cash hard fork, for every bitcoin you get 1 bitcoin from te segwit2x fork
So if you have 0.1 bitcoin you get 0. 1 bitcoin segwit2x (I thought the name is going to be bitcoin core)

You can use Bread for iPhone it protects you from forks, couple day/weeks after the fork you can claim your new coins!

Everything is going via there app, you can open up till 24 bank accounts in 5 minutes. They see themself as an IT company or the new style bank. Nothing fysic just support via app in seconds. 
Everyone that uses the app can come up with new ideas, the community can vote for it then.
Maybe you can find an e-mail to make contact with them without downloading the app!

After a couple days or weeks there Will be an update of the app, After that you can go to settings and Send your bitcoin core to an exchange or bitcoin core wallet.
But After the fork the amount would not show up in the wallet, but you can spend youre bitcoin that would not effect youre bitcoin core.
