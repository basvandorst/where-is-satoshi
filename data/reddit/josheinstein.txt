Which is exactly what this post is warning about.

Doesn’t prevent a spoofed site. I could make a site that looks just like your exchange, proxies the requests back to your exchange, prompts you for password or 2FA, etc, proxies it into the exchange, then tells the exchange to transfer all your money somewhere. It would be a very elaborate attack, but nothing that 2FA would protect against. Gotta pay attention to the URL. 
It’s a no-brainer to turn it on, but it’s not meant to solve every problem.

I am always astounded by how many people use Google as an address bar.

That’s a lot of money to trust with some unregulated dot com.

I’ve seen conflicting info on that, and the language on the web site leads me to believe that it’s probably similar to the way PayPal used to imply they were a FDIC-insured bank, when in fact they just meant that your funds were stored in their bank account which was FDIC insured. 
PayPal later had to clarify: 
I suspect Coinbase is using the same language, and it should not be used to imply they are a regulated bank.

Your point being?

Ah here you go. It’s exactly like the PayPal situation I described. You’re only protected against their bank failing. Not Coinbase failing, or mishandling your money. They are definitely not claiming to be a bank.

Wouldn’t an investment genius have sold in early January then bought back in now? These posts from people “hodling”, acting like they have any idea where the market is going are really obnoxious. Comparing past crashes to today is irrelevant. Any one of them could be the last.

If you’re ever stuck without a plunger, fill the trashcan with hot soapy water and dump it in. Works like a charm.

By that logic, you lost it the minute you bought it.
