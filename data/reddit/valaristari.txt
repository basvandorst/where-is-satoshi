This is great news. Anything that broadens the ecosystem and makes cryptocurrency more accessible and easier to use can be nothing but good for bringing more people into the cryptoworld. We WANT people to feel comfortable buying and using crypto. This is a great step in the right direction.

Didn't The King's College in New York City begin accepting Bitcoin for its tuition fees last year? I thought remember reading that in the Summer.

HA! The hemlines comment really made me laugh! But your point is well taken, and in humor we see truth. Those who did exactly this are wealthy people now.

I believe DEX's are ABSOLUTELY the future. I love me a good DEX. The problem has always been volume and speed, which is mentioned in this video. Interesting to see a DEX addressing these two issues head on. 
It sounds interesting, the team behind it seems strong, and I am a fan of NEO.
