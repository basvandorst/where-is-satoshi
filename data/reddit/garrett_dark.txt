This may lessening the anger, but something a lot of people don't learn until they're much older is people in authority positions are just people. Government, Police, Teachers....they're just people doing a job. This means the person doing their job could really care about it and do it properly, or completely do it like crap due to their own personal reasons....it all depends on the person. I have friends that became high school teachers, sometimes they're dicks to some of their students just because they feel like it. Sometimes they teach things that are factually wrong because of their own personal beliefs (I find that appalling).
In your case it sounds like your teacher doesn't like the content of your report. Since this is for an English class, I assume it's for proper writing, essay structure, ease of relating content to the reader, and such. Your teacher should only mark this report on those criteria and not it's content (as long as such content isn't racist, offensive, or something like that). I don't see anything wrong with Bitcoin, it might be a controversial topic, but nothing as bad as "abortion, drugs, sexuality". If you're able to write about mature/technical topics at an age level higher than yourself, this should be encouraged not discouraged by telling you to write about 'cleaning your room or washing the car'. Frankly it's belittling to you and your capabilities, it is insulting. You should get your parents involved to have a talk with the teacher and/or whoever her supervisor is.
tl;dr: Your teacher is doing a crappy job, she's supposed to mark your report on essay writing and such, not on content. She's probably some idiot who doesn't understand technology, and should be encouraging you instead of discouraging you. Get your parents to talk to her boss because she's not doing her job properly.
