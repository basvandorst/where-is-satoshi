But oh god as a Gator I am so scared to see how bad next season will be.

Thank you I knew I couldn't be the only one that got that stuck in my head.

I just got an invoice from them after paying with bitcoin. Crap that means I got to call customer support.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:39:58
Done.

See on my website, I have never ran ads and always focused on interacting with my audience and offering ways to donate. It has worked out better for me than ads ever could have.
edit a word

Honestly I would go broke if I could get bandcamp to take them.

Any chance of getting him running on zeronode?
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:23:34
That would still be an improvement over last year.

Hopefully someone from newegg reads this because they just lost out on supplying the parts for my new PC. Instead I went through gyft to get an amazon gift card. 
I guess they just didn't want to take my money.

Big question as someone with 225 paid albums in my bandcamp collection do they have an option for artists to release under a creative commons license?
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:26:45
Sad thing is I was half joking, but your details make it seem a little more plausible.

Which was all part of the FBI's Honeydicking. We know they had a site admin involved, they could of been helping them build features so they could catch more people.

And just think every politician that just got this rang up their lobbyists and asked for money to help protect them against this Bitcoin scourge that threatens their industry.

So I am a different situation I run a podcast and a 24/7 internet radio stream. One of my listeners has been gracious enough to donate me bitcoins throughout the year. (Greetings Captain I know you read this sub) I have used several throughout the year and plan on using some to upgrade my setup. What kind of tax liability am I likely to see?  All transactions have been for goods and services, with no btc being exchanged for cash.  
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:53:38
I will have to message them to to. I think that would be a cool feature for them to implement.

Currently,   and  if you know how to find them. Their search does not allow to do by license. Jamendo is probably the best source to get started with since everything they have is cc and they have over 400,000 tracks. 
On reddit I am a mod over at which is nothing but cc then finally a little shameless self promotion I do a cc music podcast and run a 24/7 internet stream of nothing but cc music. Check it out  
That should be enough to get you started.

You know I was just thinking I had a project in mind that I would pay btc for. But it has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin.

I need a chat bot, that pulls id3 tags from an internet stream, announces them to a chat room, then allows people to rate the track as it plays. Keeping track of votes in a database so it can either be announced in the room by the bot or pulled and put onto a web page.
I do not think it would be to hard for a competent programmer which I am not.

It does thank you. I was actually  looking forward to hearing back from you. 
So what if I cannot show that they have been in existence for over a year? or that I have had them over a year?
The other thought is most of what I have spent not all has been used to go back into production and computer set up. 
And yes I accept the terms and conditions that these responses are for purely informational use only. I should consult an accounting professional before making any financial decisions or transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:10:15
I look forward to it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:40:07
At what time frames does the tax rate change? I guess I can look on the bright side the ones spent was when the value was lower. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:45:45
I would be happy to spend but I have one hard and fast musical hipsterism which is creative commons music. 
With that being said I am surprised bandcamp has yet to offer a bitcoin purchasing option.
I think digital download download items are a perfect match for bitcoin.
