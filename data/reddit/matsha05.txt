A low-level customer service rep won't know this. Wouldn't put any merit into this conversation at all.

Childish taking out loans to invest? You don't understand finance and debt leverage. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:59:17
In a way, I guess they would know. Only problem is they're 100% corrupt. Total manipulation on their part.

What is your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:58:05
I understand that and agree 100%. I'm just saying, usually when you antagonize a person or group, the response isn't what you are hoping for. It's just negative attention.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:09:54
Definitely wouldn't poke the bear. Strong folks they is.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:00:46

Looking at your post history, you're the biggest douche in this entire community. What is your goal? To talk shit on everything?
