That might be an option if I owned a desktop.  Why should I have to though?
Until I see a major security hole in my normal usage pattern it isn't going to become worthwhile to maintain a full node for a few BTC here and there.
Feel free to point out the security implications I may be missing.

Thanks for the comment, but that doesn't solve the problem.  It's just an obvious workaround.  Telling everyone to get an external drive or run on it an old computer isn't optimal or scalable for more broad adoption.  
Why is everyone so hell-bent on maintaining status quo instead of improving and growing?  If Satoshi had seen things that way, we wouldn't even be here.
I already run full nodes for e-commerce applications.  I just don't choose to for my personal daily use.
I'd be much more interested in real reasons to run a full node as opposed to lightweight client... like security implications of the normal usage patterns stated above.

It's not impossible, but I choose not to waste half my SSD on dead data that will be used very little (if at all) after initial load.  I bet most general users are in the same boat.
If I were doing transactions with tons of BTC (ie. $10k+) it would be more important.  But for a couple of BTC here and there it doesn't seem to be worth the wasted space.
Am I missing something?
Why is there no option to prune data from years back?

So then losing money to exchange hacks and insolvency has to be a cost of doing business.

Everyone even remotely invested in bitcoin is a speculator hoping for an increase in the value in this very volatile market.
Anyone putting money in to Mt Gox was gambling with those funds when the odds were getting stacked worse and worse against seeing a return.  
These 'victims' weren't planning on sharing the proceeds of the long shot investment.  They were gambling foolishly to put money in their own pockets. How does that deserve sympathy?
If they gambled too much so that it's affecting their lives, then they have bigger problems.
Cheat me once, blame on you.  Cheat me twice, blame on me.

If I were the IRS I would give my first born for a public ledger of all financial transactions.

You assume and infer things I didn't imply.  


Yes.  To be clear... my point was the early adopters would not even think of trying out such a thing from the government.  There would be a group of early adopters, but probably few of us, skeptic of government.


Nope.  We know the code is open source.  That is fact.  I said nothing about the stupidity of people in general.  Plenty of people do actually trust their governments, right or wrong.  Are _you_ calling them stupid?


This is only your opinion, but I'm not sure what your point is.  I'm sure there are plenty of stupid people using bitcoin though.  Just take a look at all of the posts of thefts that have happened because someone got off into a technology they didn't fully understand with their hard earned dollar.


Poor circular logic pulled out of thin air to prove your weak point.
The code is just code, it can be proven safe up to a point.  The reasoning and ultimate purpose behind the code shouldn't blindly be trusted.
It's stupid people that blindly follow things without questioning.  
I'm done buddy.  Good luck with your head in the sand and tail in the air.

When you pay your taxes, do you email them and hope they get there or do you send them certified USPS with delivery confirmation?  
E-file?  Then you get a confirmation it was accepted. The point is email doesn't have have this feedback when something absolutely has to get there so we still have both and choose to use the right tool for the job. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:02:02


You make my point.  This happens realtime.  You either get a confirmation and go on your way or you don't and fix the problem immediately and try again.
You don't toss an email out there and HOPE it gets received and WAIT (hours/days?) for one of your confirmation emails when it absolutely has to be there.
You use the right tool for the job.  Email is not in this case. Point has been made over and over.  Different levels of similar technology will co-exist for quite some time, always have and always will... whether its postal mail and email, banks and bitcoin or DVDs and internet movies.
Why does my dad still watch DVDs?  Because he doesn't want to buy a new TV.  Simple as that.

Proper systems architecture doesn't add security and privacy as an afterthought.... it's ingrained in the design from the ground up.  
Yes, with hacked on features the blockchain will eventually become more private but never to the point of USD/EUR/??? cash.  Not to mention all of the transactions before such will be glaringly non private.
Satoshi envisioned (and coded) sending coins to an BTC address or **IP address**.  I still can't wrap my head around that given his own adherence to strict privacy protocols.

No, but if I wanted one world currency without a fight, open sourcing Bitcoin into the wild would be a pretty good way to start.

It won't be without violence when they come with guns to collect their taxes after we've left a breadcrumb trail of transactions. 
The only point I'm trying to make is it's ridiculous to hang our hats on "Nothing bad can happen... It's open source."  Thats a very shortsighted opinion. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 09:51:56
Just because it's own source doesn't mean there isn't a much larger scale angle that keeps us sheep and someone else not. If we knew the government created it from the get go, it would have never gotten off the ground.

Perhaps you don't understand SMTP protocol.


Nobody is arguing it isn't slower, just more dependable than your return receipts.  It's not just a function of getting a receipt confirmation from a postal mail.  It's about having a proper paper trail to show the IRS.  You don't get that with email in its current state.  You can't even prove who actually sent an email.  Headers are easily spoofed all the time.
Why would anyone buy an adapter to work with an old TV when they still have DVDs and a TV that plays them?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  To each his own.  


True statement, but it also makes my point.  It will be less used in a few years, but still used.
Old technology is here to stay for some time, just like postal mail and email, banking and bitcoin.

I don't Believe anyone limited this conversation to the safety and trustworthiness of the code.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:39:16
Hmmm.. I had to Google it.

They can be as vague and anonymous as they want to be as long as people leave their money there.
If you want transparency from them the only thing you can do is remove your funds and stop doing business with them until they lose enough business to make it important for them.

You can't hack security onto a protocol that was designed to be public and expect secure solution. 
Bitcoin has fatal security and privacy flaws at the protocol level. It is revolutionary in the concept of public ledger, but that is also its downfall on the privacy front. 
Fixing that will take more than bandaids.

Has 70% of USD moved in the last 6 months?  
How about Black Friday.. the biggest USD shopping day of the year?  Will anywhere close to a large percent of USD move this weekend?
I don't think so.  
A nice sound bite for you but little application to the real world and little to do with the insinuation that few people are transacting bitcoin.
Try to use a real statistic, like Bitcoin Transaction Volume:

You misquote my words.  I said "proper system architecture."  The correct way to build a system.. in this case securely.  
I further acknowledged that security would be hacked on just as it has been on the internet leading to a more secure system, albeit not as secure a system were it built that way from the ground up.
If you think the internet itself is secure, you are ignoring the large part of the infrastructure that is in the hands of governments.  
Not to mention the fact that all of these "add-ons" to attain security are easily foiled by human error.  One foul up and you are exposed.  A better solution would not require such a high level of technical knowledge and competence for such basic secure usage. 
Had either of these systems been designed with security and privacy being primary requirements, they would have been built differently from the beginning.  Security/privacy vs ease of use and widespread adoption; I hope you can see which way we went with both.
We're on the same side here.  I just choose to see things as they are in reality in hopes of finding a real solution.  Instead of attacking me we could have actual dialog.
