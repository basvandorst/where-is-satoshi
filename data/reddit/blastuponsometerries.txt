I believe the Vanguard 500 (S&amp;P 500) is the oldest index fund in existence.
I personally prefer [VTSMX](  As it includes small and medium caps as well.  9.7% yearly returns since inception.  However it was created in 1992, so not nearly as old as the Vanguard 500.
But if that is not enough for you, looking at all the returns since [1928]( it appears the *average* is 11.41% per year (over the decades).
So the VFINX is basically exactly on the nose for average index funds returns.

The economy has been climbing since 2011.  But more importantly, wages are still generally stagnant.  That is a much more relevant fact for most people than what the SNP500 is doing.

Stock index fund are generally expected to do about 6-8% averaged over the course of decades.
Here is one from that is 42 years old: [VFINX](
Returned an average of 11.11% per year (after fees) over 4 decades.  Pretty amazing.  Beats out long term performance of basically every hedge fund in the world.

...yeah, sorry about that...

You want an actual answer?
Understanding how large scale changes happen is different from positioning yourself to extract value from it.
To be a billionaire generally requires positioning yourself in an influential position in a company or investment fund.  Then keeping yourself there, marketing yourself properly, and being rather fortunate.
That is a very different skill set from understanding economics which is really just a combination of math and social science.

Even if everyone holding it gets a much higher net worth out of it, how does that drive adoption?
I was under the impression adoption was contingent on ease of use, safety, reputation, level of gov intervention, and merchant uptake. 
How does BTC market cap matter for any of that?

You pay in inflation.
Inflation has hovered for years around 2%.  So you arn't actually paying that much

This might be the wrong place to ask this (or a dumb question), but what to stop the gov from running a large tumbler and tracking all its users?

Even if you physically used CAD or BTC, the house would be valued in USD.
~~(appraisal is generally required in the house buying process)~~
That is what the tax would be calculated from.

Between 1980 and 1985, gold lost a staggering ***65%*** of its value.
Can you please look at this chart:
[  You can see its volatility.
You are correct, in that the supply of gold is quite stable. But unfortunately forgot the demand side of the equation.  The price of gold is set by both, demand is where its volatility comes from.
edit: [TIPS have historically fluctuated]( within the 2% margin ou are talking about including inflation protection

Bitcoin value fluctuations *each day* dramatically outweigh *yearly* dollar fluctuations. So it is absolutely not a sound medium of exchange minute-by-minute.
You could win or lose based on time of day. No business wants such a volatile feature in their cash flow.
Long term reserve of value is a very different issue. But lets just say, the investor thesis is not quite to the level of proven, yet
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:23:33
I haven't heard that, can you show me a chart? Also, if that's true, then it doesn't seem like a bonus to own gold
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:53:17
Well you should not "invest" your money in cash. Its a medium of exchange, not a generational investment vehicle.
On the order of decades, you should be invested in the market/property/ect
If you do keep it in cash, it should at least be in a CD ladder or something that will track interest rates and inflation over time

How long we talking about here?

You can't really compaire the returns like that across asset classes.
You compare return for the risk taken.
CDs are low return but very very low risk.
Bitcoin is extremely high return but also extremely high risk.
Speculation on Bitcoin might make you rich, but still keep next months rent in something a bit more stable
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:41:44
Yes, that is why you should only keep your money in cash that you will need in the next 6 months or so.
If you accumulate more then than, you start moving the excess into investments.

TIPS would be far more responsible, gold can be rather volatile and has lost some value recently

Where did I say this is the end!? This is just another test. It will likely survive this one and there will be more tests.  Such is life.
However if Bitcoin cannot manage petty attacks by a few millionaires, it is not ready for broader adoption.
That is not a prediction.  Its a simple fact.
Personally, I think it will make it through this.  The world is watching.

If BTC cannot survive greedy bastards, it might not be suited for an economy run on self interest.
One of the reasons to move off the gold standard was that the gov didn't want speculators attacking USD.
Hopefully BTC can survive. But if it cannot manage this simple test, it's sadly not ready to support a larger slice of the economy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:15:15
Of course!
Got me to do some research to remember the mechanics of it all

All fixed-rate exchange rate systems invite speculation.  Doesn't matter if a currency is pegged to a commodity (like gold) or another currency (like the UK was pegged to the German mark up to 1992).
All things fluctuate in value over time.  If a fixed currency and the underlying peg fluctuate in different directions, speculators will short the currency.  Then the government will then be required to spend their peg reserves to maintain the peg.  This can become extremely expensive for the government.  Drives up the value of the peg (as they buy more) and down the value of their currency (if they buy in their own currency) further.
In the case of the UK peg to German Marks, George Soros became famous and made ~$1 billion off the British government before the peg was abandoned.
A very similar situation was happening in the US during the great depression.  It was becoming very expensive to maintain the dollar peg to gold.  The gold supply became tight as the depression hit.
There was fear that the US gov would decrease the peg to gold.  So there was a run on the gov with people exchanging for gold before the devaluation happened.  It was bad enough, that the gov was forced to devalue anyway to prevent a serious loss of gold reserves.
But even that was not sustainable.  So the gov changed then to fiat.
Hope that helps!

That's why you use online banks.  Still FDIC insured but higher rates. Traditional banks suck
Ally bank has a 1.25% rate. Higher for CDs
At least it nullifies inflation, so pretty stable value
