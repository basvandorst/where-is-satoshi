Insults are intended to offend no?
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:15:31
Ok, so a made up insult for an entire generation of people

Do they background check your dependants too?

Are you for real? There's no evidence of that. I think you have been misled by alt right news media.

The majority did not vote for Trump so your analogy makes no sense.

I agree with you about Bitcoin.

I'm not sure how you can justify this statement. Don't you feel bad for insulting like a billion people without even a passing attempt at backing up your argument with citation?
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:50:27
That is made up
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:49:06
You literally just guessed?
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:59:24
You realize you are talking about a person who can't form complete sentences.

Did the judge mention his gender or race or was 'privilege' the only thing mentioned?
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:01:08
You even admit he insults people
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:25:31
Not sure why you are laughing. He lied about releasing his tax returns, so we cannot assess his finances. He could easily have more debt than assets.
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:12:04
We don't know that until he releases his tax returns. I'm expecting his net worth is negative.

Insults makes politicians look weak
