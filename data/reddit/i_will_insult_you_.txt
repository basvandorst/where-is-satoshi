On a free market, monopolies cannot exist. No matter how successful a company is, it is never immune from competition. It always faces at least potential competition, as well as actual competition from companies that offer substitutes.
Alcoa, for instance, dominated the market for aluminum for a time, yet this did not result in higher prices for customers, but lower prices. Why? Because, even in the absence of strong competitors, raising prices would have attracted such competitors, while Alcoa’s customers—say, Coca-Cola—could have applied further pressure by switching back to glass bottles instead of the more expensive aluminum cans.
The free market protects freedom of competition—any company can use its property to offer products and services to consumers on any voluntarily agreed upon terms. The result is not destructive monopolies, but an explosion of productivity, creativity, and innovation.

my responses
1. you should visit  if you honestly think we NEED the state to keep us safe. Fuck your statist Infrastructure, and I'm going to pay for my education, as well as my children's considering private education is much better than anything the state can muster up. 
2. You doubt North Korea is minting us currency. [A quick google search brings up a few stories BTW you should really try using google, it's a lot faster then having people answer you on reddit](
3. So you talk about how north korea can't feed it's own citizens, and then you ask why the free market is a good thing?? Do you even understand that the entire reason korea can't do the simple task of feeding it's citizens is because it doesn't have a free market. The government has the monopoly on many services that could be made infinitely better through the free market IE Waste Management, Education, and the infamous Court System. Super Companies will no longer be bailed out when they fail, and they will no longer have the strength of the US army to go to war for them. 
4. We have never seen a true free market, because we have always had a State in some form. 
5. We have never had a global market, because of countries not able to use Visa, Paypal, or even have a government strong enough to build a currency to back it up.

Somalia has seen more progress as a country since the government failed, than it ever had with a state. 
You are anti progress sir. 
[here is some stuff on the progress in Somalia](

If its because of tax, then it's not free. 
In a free market, the business only survives if it serves the consumer, the same rules apply to private schooling. If the government didn't provide schooling, you would end up with a huge new Education market, resulting in very inexpensive, and effective education. 
The idea that you somehow wouldn't go to school, just because the state didn't steel the money from your parents pay check and pay for it for you is what is fucked.

1. Anonymous possession and transactions. you no longer have to give your personal information to buy things online. This also means that countries who didn't have an established currency can now have btc, and buy things online. 
2. True value- the dollar is only as good as the government backing it, and clearly btc will allow us all to evade tax effectively making the government completely broke. 
3. infinitely higher number of anonymous transaction verifications because of it's open source nature. The US dollar is faked and minted by other countries like North Korea. I actually doubt we know how many dollars are in existence. 
4. A true free market, something the world had never seen before
5.  Btc connects a global market

A company only survives if it serves the consumer
Who is going to pay for cops? The same people that pay for them now, except they will be able to voluntarily pay, instead of being forced to pay.

I'm sorry if this is too hard for your brain to take in. You've been raised in a society that depends on the government, and now you fear a world without it. 
I'm just gonna say this. It doesn't matter if your afraid of a world without the state, the state WILL collapse under bitcoin weather you understand it or not.

Why in the world is everyone all of the sudden robbing? And who is robbing the poor? 
Monopolies are created by government intervention. 
No Monopoly exists in a free market, because you can't stop the competition.
