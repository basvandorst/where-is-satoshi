Yes, this is very important. Noone who owns bitcoin.com invented bitcoin. Similarly, bitcoin core did not invent bitcoin. They just gained control of development a few years ago.
Bitcoin has no owner, and its founder (Satoshi) is either dead or wisely hiding their identity (identities). They're definitely not CSW, who is a complete fraud.

I've asked core supporters (I'm a BCH heathen), and never found a convincing answer.
They believe the nodes protect decentralization, "full node" meaning "non-mining". In my view, miners hold all the power, since they put transactions into blocks. Nodes just exist to relay transactions and remember the mempool.
Plus, if nodes really were a centralization target, it would be trivial for a nation-state attacker to gain a majority of the nodes. After all, there's no profit motive, so we don't see the massive steady rise in "node power" like we do with hashpower. This is why the original bitcoin whitepaper doesn't even make the distinction - what Satoshi calls a node is a miner.
[As an aside, BCH and BTC are so similar in block size right now that nodes can be ran on both networks for a very reasonable amount of money]
So, it's really a difference in the view of the roles of different entities within the bitcoin ecosystem. I think with a deep understanding of how Bitcoin works, it is inarguable that mining is where the centralization risk exists. But of course, not everyone agrees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:52:44
Depends on the current subreddit. Since we're on the dark side would be BCH, also known as bcash, btrash, bcrash, VerCoin, etc. I view the name-calling as an indication of insecurity.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:24:11
Serious question, do *you* understand and believe in the technology? Do you use bitcoin to transact frequently?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:07:15
That's the argument from core. If you do some math yourself, perhaps you'll reach the same conclusion I did - that the argument does not make sense.
Also note that in the original bitcoin whitepaper, "full nodes" and miners were functionally the same thing. This is because the miners have 100% of the say on which transactions get included into blocks.
In other words, if you want to guarantee transactions will be uptaken, you need to mine a block yourself and put your transaction in it. Otherwise you have to pay a miner to do so.
The block size increase allows more transactions per block, so fees go down. It doesn't change the decentralization properties of the network. The biggest threat to BTC (and BCH by extension) is the mining power being centralized.
People should still run full nodes, and they absolutely can. BCH is only at 8MB blocks, so both BTC and BCH can have full nodes.
By the time we reach 100 MB blocks (after tx capacity increases by a factor of ~12.5x), storage costs will have hopefully continued going down exponentially as well. So for the next few years Bitcoin will be fine, giving some needed development breathing room.

Yes, paying for child with parent works great (minus the high fee, of course). I assume miners simply calculate the net satoshi/byte of all the transactions in the child-parent chain (basically lumping everything together into one big transaction), but I have no idea how they actually do it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:44:42
What do you mean "silent for four years"?
Your assertion is false. I'm not a sock puppet and it wouldn't take much digging for you to establish that conclusively.
You seem to hold a view of consensus that is very odd.


lol, what?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:46:13
What power can non-mining nodes exert over miners, besides refusing to relay tx/blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:18:02


Verifying transactions scales linearly with tx size, no? 
I don't view crippling a network as an acceptable tradeoff for making nodes cheaper to run. This is because, again, miners hold the ultimate authority on what transactions get put into blocks. There's no way for nodes to counteract that.


This is how p2p networks work. It will always take more bandwidth over time, but as long as bandwidth scales linearly with transactions (and it does) then it shouldn't be an issue.


Of course not. I just have a different opinion regarding the role of nodes. I would like it if nodes had the power, but the way BTC is designed, they don't and can't [in my opinion].
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:39

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:21:36


[citation needed]
Every time I've run the numbers, increasing the block limit doesn't seem to lead to increased centralization. This makes sense since the largest centralization risks are in the miners and the dev team in charge

nice casual racism. really a great contribution to the discussion. 10/10, would watch BTC die from within again
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:55:41
Other factors: electricity costs, your own technical ability in running a mining facility.


Probably investing it, but hard to say. The issue is BTC difficulty keeps going up by ~20% each difficulty adjustment. This will slow down, but the core problem is that mining difficulty will keep going up, meaning if you don't have a ton of capital the big miners with the real advantages will eat your lunch
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:36:21
No. Only mining nodes do.
Non-mining nodes are "helpers" that relay transactions and hold unconfirmed tx in their mempool. With 100% non-mining node control, you could prevent certain TXs from being broadcast, but you couldn't double spend or any of the other attacks that you can do with majority hashpower

The best support for a price is actual usage. But we have a subreddit of people who think it's perfectly okay that BTC remains unusable for small transactions, so long as they can still buy $10,000 of BTC at once to hodl with.
When BTC was $.01, attitudes were so different. It's stunning how much things have changed. When did people stop believing in BTC's ability to scale without conducting actual tests?
Satoshi was confident it would scale, because he knew that even though tx's scale linearly with blocksize, memory storage grows exponentially, which mirrors the growth of BTC's usage, meaning scaling will proceed smoothly in the near-medium term, and is probably fine in the long-term but can be supplemented with features like LN, etc
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:50:40
Because the reason most people are buying BTC is because of exactly what you said...they think the price will go up. They don't give a fuck about the technology, they don't understand private/public keys, they don't understand the blockchain (+ merkle trees, etc), they don't understand what bitcoin mining is even doing.
When I got into bitcoin there was a very different vision. It was about flipping the system on its head, allowing you to send money wherever you wanted for (basically) free. This was supposed to allow hundreds of millions of unbanked individuals to benefit from an open financial system. It was supposed to allow people in countries with rampant hyperinflation like Venezuela (I used to have a venezuelan friend who I lost contact with during the waves of violence under maduro) to get their money out of a centralist / fascist shithole (while avoiding inflation so that they could feed their families).
None of that is part of the vision anymore. The vision is to make BTC yet another asset for rich people to jerk off to and trade while those will small amounts of BTC get fucked. Who else is supposed to use BTC besides the ultra rich if the network can only process 6 transactions per second? That's ultimately the source of it costing $30 to send your BTC from one address to another, which is the most direct reason that I sold my BTC (while losing my shirt to transaction fees to do so)
As a lower-level aside, the problem of small blocks =&gt; high transaction fees, combined with rising btc price =&gt; more hashpower =&gt; mining becomes more difficult over time is looming. Those two factors together will mean that if the BTC price crashes (which it has in the past and will in the future, of course), moving BTC from one address to another will be impossible without paying a ludicrous fee (imagine $100, $300 etc). This means the rich will be able to liquidate while the poor hold the bag (until exchanges like coinbase go down, at which time shit will really hit the fan).
None of the above is guaranteed to happen, but it's a very real threat and part of what's motivating me away from BTC
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:12:37
Is it cheaper to tx in litecoin? Litecoin is a fine recommendation as a replacement for BTC, but I have doubts that it has significant cost advantages over BTC.
Faster blocks are great. I'd like to see that in BCH down the road, although it'll get a little weird when BCH can no longer claim to be "closer to the whitepaper".

This subreddit is pro-Bitcoin Core, and tends to ****** dissenting comments. They also view discussion of BCH as "against consensus" since they define the idea of consensus in a way that excludes anyone else. In short they like to talk about decentralization and freedom but they can't walk the walk.
Here's a comment of mine that was ******** earlier today:




It was silently removed so I didn't get a justification, but presumably they consider it altcoin discussion or some other bullshit.
If you thought it was weird that is basically the BCH subreddit, that's because was created in response to ********** before the great forkening ever happened. Now we're happily enmeshed in a destructive civil war that will probably lead to massive loss of value on both sides as smart money flees into alternatives that aren't embroiled in kindergarten conflicts.
(As an aside, I was called a foreign shill by a user here because one of my past submissions on an unrelated subreddit was written in spanish...)
A full coverage of the history of all the drama would take forever, and I'm not even fully up to date on it myself. I try to stick to technological discussion, which gets hard on this subreddit when noone has even read Satoshi's whitepaper (it's like 4 pages and super understandable, take a look if you haven't). Here's one example of the lead *** here discussing their ********** policy: 
^ actually pretty crazy to read cause they*** correctly forecasted what his actions would end up causing
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:00:05
The value comes from a transaction network that actually works. Try to send some BTC from one address to another. It'll likely cost you $20-50. Now try sending some BCH - it'll be well over 300x cheaper (actual number is far higher).
It has the same bitcoin blockchain because it's a fork of bitcoin. It's not an altcoin or an ICO. By the way, you realize Bitcoin Core didn't create bitcoin or write the initial code right?


Please show your math. I've done the math, and big blocks seem viable. Exponential increase in tx throughput requires exponential increase in blocksize. This is countered by exponential improvement in computing power and storage space. The end result is some constant multiple, which is quite acceptable (we can always handle a constant, we can't handle unbounded exponential growth without an exponential offset).


Sorry, can you explain what you mean here? I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:39:33
Hard forks don't have to be "contentious". I'd bet money that if BCH forks as planned at 6 month intervals, at least the very first fork will go smoothly (I'm not gonna make predictions further than that) 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:45:12
Neither is more legitimate than the other. It just so happens that BCH is designed to be more directly usable.
If you yourself understand how forks work, then you should feel a little silly trying to trash one fork just because you prefer the other fork.
Both can coexist, until they can't.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:07


It was an old limit that was never supposed to stay there.
Then Core took over the codebase and suppressed blocksize increases.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:19:12


It's precisely bigger blocks...Notice how segwit "splits" the block and gives extra room for witness data
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:29:59
Core views nodes as protecting against attacks; ie they enforce the reference rules.
However, this makes no sense to me. Miners have all the power. Nodes exist to relay transactions and hold the unconfirmed tx in their mempools, whereas miners have the ultimate say of which transactions get included in blocks. There’s no way as a node to force a miner to include a given tx in the block.
Thus the ultimate centralization risk for bitcoin is miner centralization, not ‘big blocks’ (note that big is relative).

The voting system isn't a bad idea, but vulnerable to attacks. How do you verify the identities of owners? Some sort of proof of stake system?
The current way is best. Forks occur, and the market decides. For example, I sided with BCH in the recent fork because I don't buy the arguments against blocksize increases

I'm guessing the fee was too low? Might have better results with a fee closer to 1cent (I calculated your fee as being ~.3 cents)
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:20:59
10 minutes is the expected value. It's not always ten minutes. When difficulty and hashpower become misaligned, you can mine more than 10 blocks per minute expected value or mine less than 10 blocks per minute expected value.
The problem is throwing more hashpower at the problem only works for a matter of days. Once the next DA hits, the problem begins again.
BTC will never have low fees again, ever, until blocksize increases. LN won't fix it, despite everyone's blind faith. LN is fine, but we need slow exponential blocksize growth
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:01:13
Miners choose which transactions get put in blocks, no?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:31:53
Why do you think that is?
Usually that would imply they paid off-chain for a transaction accelerator, or it's a tx that belongs to the miner (unlikely in this case), OR it was the highest sat/byte tx that still fit in the block. However these are all rare, niche scenarios. It seems unlikely to me that a miner would have an algorithm that *doesn't* greedily select by sat/b
edit: the last option I forgot to discuss is CPFP (child pays for parent). However in that case at least one of the tx's does have to have a high fee, so it would just look like a "low fee" even though it's not
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:46:38
Your fee numbers are a stunning misrepresentation. $0.30 isn't even close, try 1-3 cents.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:51:44
When will people here accept that TX fees aren't due to a malicious attack, but instead a natural economic result of 1-1.7MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:23:27
That may be how *you* use it, but I got into BTC years ago, and I certainly used it as a currency. The whole use case was built around that.
You can retroactively change the vision, sure, but that's what led to the great forkening in the first place


I want to let the old banking system die, not keep it alive.


What about dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:29:03
Hard forking doesn't really mean a "new chain". Look at Monero (XMR), for example.
However when a fork is contentious, then you have two chains (technically you always have two chains, but if the old chain dies off right away you can pretend it doesn't exist)
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:14:29
Monero is great, but transactions are very large due to the ring signatures. This will go down over time, and really the difference is only an order of magnitude so it doesn't matter, but it's not really a BCH/BTC replacement (public vs private blockchains, etc).
Litecoin fulfills the role fine. Technically doesn't have more hashpower, but what coin does?
Zcash I haven't done my own research. Doesn't seem as usable as, say, XMR.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:03:47
Community fragmentation has already occurred. That's why there's different subreddits and different forks of bitcoin. Unfortunately, the core devs themselves were (in my eyes) what led to the fragmentation.


Perhaps, but it hasn't stopped yet. Let's address that when it comes to it.


To me, this is completely antithetical to the idea of decentralization. It's one thing to have leaders (after all, Satoshi was a leader), but it's another to have a group of self-appointed 'leaders' who suppress discussion at every turn, and seem to have changed the meaning of the word "consensus" to mean "the consensus of bitcoin core".
It seems to me that actual users of the BTC network are migrating to BCH if they have any significant transaction volume. Whereas the ones left holding BTC are largely the hodlers, who have no intention of actually transacting with BTC and don't believe in the vision of a p2p electronic cash system
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:15:32
How so?
To me, BTC is a crappy version of BCH. Why? Because the block size is arbitrary neutered, leading to $5-20 transaction fees. Do you actually use BTC to transact, or do you just hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:03:53
The original intention was to only have a real fee market after coins dried up.
However Bitcoin Core decided that we could have a fee market a century before Satoshi intended. Now we all get to experience the joy of $40 tx fees (yes, I really paid that fee)
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:17:54


It doesn't hurt censorship resistance at all. The arguments against increasing block size all seem asinine to me. I've truly never heard of a real justification, and that's because one probably doesn't exist. What use is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system (oh right, that's not even the vision for BTC anymore) with $5-20 transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:22:07
Why *do* people value Bitcoin? I know why I value(d) it, and what got me into BTC in the first place. You can no longer send a small amount of money to a friend across the world without worrying about $30 fees. We used to talk about hyperinflationary countries like Venezuela being helped out by being able to store value in BTC. Now how is someone supposed to do that when fees are practically a month's salary or more?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:05:05
I know it wasn't, it was for malleability. And yet, a block size increase was snuck in all the same, and Segwit was advertised as helping congestion. So I'm not sure what I got downvoted for, considering I understand the underlying concepts quite well

Props for runnig an actual mining node. You’re actually helping secure the network (slightly) as opposed to running a non-mining node
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:03:21
More importantly, full-blockchain non-mining nodes exist to relay transactions and hold unconfirmed tx in the mempool. They are helpers, they have no relation to network security.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:29


Was it? I've heard ~1.7x as the most common number. Are you sure you're talking about blocksize and not block *weight*?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:48:26


Can you clarify a bit how this is done? You can refuse to relay blocks, but if the blocks are valid, then presumably there will be some % of non-mining nodes that WILL relay the blocks.
Moreover, attacks on non-mining nodes are attacks on transaction broadcast / blockchain distribution. However it's not an attack on the blockchain itself, which requires hashpower.


So, using your definition, BTC is centralized, is it not? (I actually agree with your definition)
Let's say you're right that non-mining nodes are critical to network integrity. I'm an attacker, let's say I'm China to make it easy. What stops me from running a million nodes? Very little.
On the other hand, while a nation-state getting majority hashpower is feasible, it's not nearly as easy because of the profit incentive of mining. Non-miners have no profit incentive and thus are vulnerable to attack from a well-capitalized enemy.


I agree. However BCH isn't just running because of Jihan or whoever the designated scapegoat is. It's certainly vulnerable to attack, primarily because BTC still has more hashrate. Still, give it a week - the more prices equalize, the more hashpower should equalize too (although it's a little tricky to forecast since BCH has different difficulty adjustment)
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:40:27


Why is that in scare quotes? Are you saying that fees aren't low in BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:02:06
SR used BTC as its currency, so it was certainly on-chain...
Yes, once coins enter SR then they're not really moved around, they're just moved via accounting. But the coins are shown in the chain flowing into SR, and they can also be followed coming out of SR
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:39:45


But...it already did. That's what bitcoin cash *is* (ignoring all the other forks like bitcoin gold, etc which I'm not remotely interested in because they don't add anything).
Personally, I think it is the "core stance", given that core has heavily influenced the opinions of this subreddit, via ******ship, etc. But regardless, for me it's a simple technological issue. I believe in Satoshi's vision for scaling, which involves increasing the block size in proportion to the number of transactions over a certain minimum fee level. The best way to do this is continuously - currently BCH hard forks every 6 months, but I believe there's talk of implementing auto adjustment, much like how difficulty adjustment works.


That's fine, we just have different definitions of bitcoin. My definition of bitcoin is similar to how it was before ~2012 - a p2p electronic cash system.


Where I disagree full-stop with Core (or "bitcoin users" if you prefer that characterization) is that increasing the block size in proportion to TX volume is not a risk to the centralization. This is because the centralization risk is and has always been in the mining.
As much as people love to talk about "full nodes" here, the nodes really just exist to help people's transactions get in the mempool. The miners decide which transactions leave the mempool and enter the blockchain. They do this by greedily selecting by fee, but there's no guarantee of that. So for example, if I owned 100% of BTC hashpower, I could choose to mine blocks with only one transaction inside the entire block. It would be very silly, since I would be throwing away plenty of fees, but it helps illustrate why miners hold so much power in the bitcoin ecosystem.
Full nodes make sense to validate the blockchain to make sure you aren't getting fucked over. But there's no reason for someone who owns $20 of BTC to run a full node. If you own $10,000 in BTC, then it makes sense. Fortunately, *both BCH and BTC* are small enough that full nodes are trivial to run (from a hardware perspective). You really don't need that much storage, RAM, or CPU time for it to be cost prohibitive. As long as the block size increases of BCH scale intelligently, IE we go up a % at a time instead of jumping from 8MB to 1GB, then it's my believe that there will not be centralization pressure.
Bitcoin's on this weird trajectory, where it started by being about decentralization, taking power away from big banks, preventing your cash from getting seized by the government, helping citizens in countries like venezuela escape hyperinflation and capital controls, etc.
Now, BTC isn't for poor people, it's not for everyday transactions, it's perplexingly a "store of value" that is becoming more and more difficult to use. Lightning, etc are great, but we shouldn't hold block size back while waiting for the development to finish. Nor should we assume that once LN is usable, that it will outright fix the fee issue. It will help, but without cheap on-chain transactions, BTC will continue to have limited usefulness (in my eyes, obviously).
Thanks for participating in this discussion.

What's really fun is to do a little mental model of what happens when the price crashes.
Here's what mine looks like:
price goes down =&gt; hashpower goes down =&gt; blocks mined rarely, mempool explodes =&gt; general panic as users who still hold their private keys can't move BTC without paying a 1000 satoshi/byte fee =&gt; exchanges like gdax go down briefly due to insane volume =&gt; negative feedback cycle has begun
This is why I'm exiting BTC, even though there could still be plenty of wind in its sails price-wise. I'm not comfortable praying for a greater fool to give me money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:13:38

You don't have a problem with $40 fees? That's fine, but I definitely do.
And please stop pretending that fees protect decentralization. BTC would be just as decentralized with 8MB blocks instead of 1.1-1.7MB we have currently. Satoshi intended for fees to become dominant *after* the mining supply of BTC became exhausted

Do I really need to explain why that scenario is impossible?
a) We don't know who satoshi is/are (could be multiple individuals)
b) There's no patents/IP owned by any individual
c) Bitcoin is an open-source protocol with open-source software
d) If it were possible to sue, which it's not, BTC would be sueable as well considering it has made changes that weren't outlined in the whitepaper

the problem is that we know how market dynamics work when you have to compete to get transactions into small blocks. they're not pretty, as current fees demonstrate
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:53:02
1) Not really. You can buy ASIC miners or GPU clusters, but good luck competing with the big guys
2) You need ASICS or GPUs, and an absolute massive amount of hashpower. It goes ASIC &gt; GPU &gt; CPU.
3) In your own wallet (memorizing or storing your own private keys). However right now, with BTC specifically, fees are so high that ironically the smart people are storing their coins in exchanges like GDAX. It's a sad situation.
4) When you convert BTC to cash, you must pay capital gains in the US. I have no idea about the UK, but assume it's similar.
5) Fairly easy to buy/cash out, exchanges can go down during high volume however. You have to pay a fee whenever you move bitcoins (transact). Right now the fees are insanely high ($30 on average).


The best way would be to own a smaller coin lacking in software, then write software to improve it. You could try arbitrage but with the sketchiness of exchanges you'll likely get slaughtered.


Ha. That question will be controversial. This subreddit's opinion tends to be that bitcoin will keep growing exponentially in price. I used to believe that, but with the current state of the network, my money is on BTC losing to its rival fork BCH. However I own some of both.


Bitcoin will be useless in this scenario. So will USD. Think about it: would you trade someone food during an apocalypse for a number that, if you take the sha256 hash of the number, has a certain number of leading zeroes (that's what bitcoin is)? The only useful thing will be expertise, medicine, guns, ammo, food, water, etc. EMP-wise it depends. If you do the smart thing and **memorize** your private keys (memorize your seed), you will be safe against an EMP.


Bitcoin futures and bitcoin cash are two totally different topics.
I'll discuss Bitcoin Cash.
The fork arose because of two competing visions for Bitcoin - one where Bitcoin is a settlement layer for (largely first-world) individuals, but almost all transactions are handled on another layer (lightning network), etc. This first vision, vision A, involves keeping the block size fixed, which keeps the # of transactions per second around 6-7. Proponents of vision A feel that increasing block size has the risk of leading to centralization of the bitcoin network.
Vision B involves making on-chain transactions affordable and fast by increasing the block size limit. Layer 2 solutions are still possible but are to be developed after blocksize increase, rather than forcing the second-layer solutions to be complete before letting blocksize grow. Vision B claims to be more aligned with the original vision of Bitcoin as described by Satoshi. That's my belief as well, but most here would either disagree with that assertion, or would maintain that Satoshi's thoughts are outdated.
I would explain the whole big blocks =&gt; centralization argument, but I've never heard a convincing one. Suffice to say that Vision A proponents view non-mining nodes as key to the decentralization of the network. Non-mining nodes exist to relay transactions and to hold unconfirmed transactions in memory (the mempool). Vision B proponents view the miners as key to the decentralization. Miners are the sole deciders of which transactions get taken into blocks (which transactions get confirmed), so miners wield the vast majority of the power. This is why the bitcoin principle is "one hash one vote". If you have the majority hashpower, you can compromise the network in certain ways (double-spending, etc).
There's so much more to go into, but there's a start for you. By the way, Vision A is Bitcoin Core (Vision B is Bitcoin Cash (Also there's a chance my comment will get ******** by the **** so I'll PM this comment to you if that ends up happening.

What, do you think 1MB is a magic number? That if BTC had 2MB block sizes, decentralization would collapse and transactions wouldn't go through?
Regardless of block size, a fee market always arises when demand outstrips capacity. The issue is that when you set the capacity arbitrarily low from the get-go, fees get far higher than they need to be. Miners would be just as happy to mine with $.5 fees per transaction if there's, say, 10x as many transactions as there currently are with BTC.
I've thought very much about the "decentralization risk", and my conclusion is that there is no risk whatsoever with modest block size increases, and still virtually no risk with larger increases. If you're worried about decentralization, look at mining itself - whoever controls the hashpower controls the network, as intended. Or look at the flow of information - if one BTC dev team [core] suppresses the others [classic, XT, BU or what have you], then decentralization suffers. And that's what's been happening for years with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:24
Oh man. Why'd you sell your BCH if you think fees are ridiculous? That was kinda the central reason BCH even exists!

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:16
You misunderstand. 8MB is the current cap. It will be scaled more when the transaction throughput gets high enough. Right now BCH blocks aren't even 2MB so no reason to go higher.
Verification will never be the limiting factor
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:09


Yes. 0conf for small transactions, normal confirmation times for large transactions.
BCH may eventually move to a faster block production rate (say, every minute) as well which will help further
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:32:48
Yes...it's called Bitcoin.
Look at the history of BTC itself and the answer is pretty clear. For most of BTC's history tx fees were a rounding error at best.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:32:42
It's absolutely *stunning* watching the change in BTC rhetoric over time. It used to be about restoring power to individual actors, at a time where [warning: US perspective incoming] civil asset forfeiture was a thing, the financial crisis led to massive bailouts, physical cash continued trending towards being made illegal, and generally you were fucked without the banking system.
Now we have all the same problems, but nobody's interested in all that. They're interested in the money they make (or lose) through speculation, they're interested in to the moon hodl memes, etc. I'd wager the majority (or at the very least a large minority) of BTC users don't even own their own private keys.
I mean fuck, we've reached a point where "hard fork" is considered a dirty word in the BTC community, when anyone experienced with open-source, decentralized software development knows that hard forks are a healthy and essential process of growth.
[As an aside, the distinction between a soft fork and a hard fork is silly. Yes, soft fork if you can, but being afraid of hard forks just holds everybody back]
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:56:59
Why don't you address my other claim? That LN is not more decentralized than on-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:11:41
I have no idea. Hashpower will keep marching up until the price declines. While technically as I said before the profitability of mining should stay the same, in reality it doesn't since miners don't start up / stop at perfect times, and they have differences in cost basis (some pay pennies on the dollar for their electricity bills).
It's a brutal game, so mining should either be considered a fun hobby (which will make some money back, but is not a business), or a full-on, heavily capitalized business. There's really no room in the middle there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:46:26
Sorry bud. You misunderstand the situation. The fees you got taxed are the BTC network fees.
You’re having trouble sending because you’re sending with too low of a fee.
Unfortunately if you’re only gonna buy $40 of BTC you should never take it off an exchange. I just paid a $40 *transaction fee* yesterday...

No, mining nodes are how you measure decentralization. What core supporters call ‘full nodes’ (a bizarre name) do not secure the network. Miners do. Want to attack BCH? Do a 51% attack.

@_date: 2017-12-19 07:47:53
That's correct. I tend to overstate BCH fees since I'm pro-BCH so I'd rather not have a rabid core supporter splitting hairs over me lowballing it.
BCH fees are how BTC used to be...you don't have to think about them at all, besides making sure your client isn't recommending ludicrously high fees. And that's exactly how I prefer it
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:10:16
That's exactly the point - the current BTC community is afraid of hard forks outright. So it will take quite some time for BTC core to catch up to speed with the developments in other coins, considering they can't even keep vanilla BTC usable.
Naturally, hard forks are the only way to change things, and are not to be feared. But convincing this subreddit of that will be incredibly difficult.


Of course not. Anybody who actually uses BTC can see that quite clearly.

Insecurity. BTC holders feel threatened by BCH - correctly in my eyes. If they sold their BCH weeks ago, then they are all-in on BTC and BTC failing would erase their wealth.
If you haven't sold your fork coins, any transfer of wealth between BTC and BCH (both ways) will cause no impact to you. However any capital leaving the Bitcoin system (heading towards, litecoin, XMR, zcash or whatever) will of course be gone.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:32:31
Segwit2x is dead. It already got killed off weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:24:53
Because BTC only supports 6-7 tx/sec with max segwit adoption.
More hashpower temporarily lowers the mempool, until difficulty adjusts and the problem comes back even worse. That's what's been happening for weeks now.
This is a very scary time to be all in BTC. If you don't have forked coins, it may be wise to diversify. The liquidity risk is very real.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:35:25
This is not true. Have you read the original whitepaper?
That's what SPV clients are based on. You only have to verify a tiny % of transactions, which does not require the full blockchain.
Do you use electrum, or do you run your own non-mining node?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:49:43
Without some more numbers behind your assertions, I don't find them convincing. I don't think it's at all bandwidth-prohibitive or cost-prohitive to run a full node. Also the distinction between nodes and miners is a little arbitrary.
Storing 8MB every 10 minutes is no big deal. In fact, if LN never came into existence, storing 1GB every ten minutes would be fine. Why? Your average user does not run a full node, nor do they have the resources to, even right now in BTC. Light clients are the de-facto standard.
We can still achieve decentralization without every user running a node. We just need enough of the mining power, etc to be distributed so that it does not become overly centralized. This risk is equally present in BTC and BCH.


It was set to 1MB years ago, for exactly that reason "why not"? We were far away from full blocks.
Well, now blocks are full, the mempool has grown, tx fees have grown, and there's no change in sight. That's why 1MB is no longer the correct magic number.
One solution would be an exponential increase, say, max block size increases 10% every year. Or, it increases in proportion to the # of average transactions / sec, but only counting transactions above a minimum fee level (say .00001 BTC or something) to prevent spam
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:12
16000 tx/~~sec~~BLOCK is BCH's current limit, not the max limit. (Edit: Technically right now it can scale up to 32MB without a soft fork though so call it 64000 tx/block) I'm a proponent of scaling blocksize in proportion to the # of transactions above a certain fee level.
In ten years' time we could easily have 1GB blocks, or sooner if BCH adoption grows.
BTC is stuck at around 4000 tx/~~sec~~block, with no plans to scale further on-chain
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:07:35
Bitcoin could cannabilize, but it won't. People will want the BTC protocol to stay the same. If we can't even change block size, how would we change proof of work, block emission, implement ring signatures etc?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:16
Indeed. Just like in Star Wars, the dark side is *way* more fun!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:10:27
Hmm, if you wouldn't mind linking the transaction, that could shed some light.
What kind of fee did you set? That's a little surprising because even really low fee transactions are being uptaken within 1 block. For example my BTC transactions have been around $7 in fees +- $3, whereas my BCH transactions are on the order of cents or less.
Edit: Maybe you did that transaction at the very beginning of the BCH fork, when there was very little hashpower (thus blocks were mined really slowly)?
Anyway, if you want to discuss the technological underpinnings of BTC vs BCH, etc, let me know. I would just start talking, but I've written long comments in the past only to find that the person I was talking to didn't actually care about the discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:08:13
How many bytes is your transaction? You’ll need to pay at least 300 satoshis per byte with the current mempool. Most likely your tx size is huge cause of lots of UTXOs
Unfortubately BTC is nearly unusable on chain for small fish now. Sadly you’ll have to either stay on an exchange like coinbase or transfer to an alternate option like bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:43:21
Larger blocks don't necessarily favor miners. It's probably better for them long run, but in the short term they won't earn those delicious transaction fees.
Their reasoning is very dubious. They believe increasing block size leads to centralization risk, but the entire argument hinges on the false idea that non-mining nodes play a role in securing the network. I've never found an argument that actually makes sense to me. I would recommend asking some Core supporters for their reasoning.

What? What relation does RAM have to do with blocksize? Isn’t the centralization argument based on storage limits, ie with either HDs or SSDs? Fizzling out of ram makes no sense.


Show me your math. This claim is absurd.
(Anti-core viewpoint disclosure: I strongly feel that bigger blocks do not lead to centralization when scaled properly, so maybe I’m biased)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:18:51


It's not malicious. My point is that there was no technical reason for them to increase block weight. They did it to alleviate fees slightly, but are refusing to increase the blocksize further. It wasn't the *solution to the vulnerability* as you said, unless I misunderstand how segwit works


Really depends on your perspective. To me, Core is the one strongarming.

Why a couple? Even if blocks were 100MB right now, that would be doable with a reasonable computing machine (if you're talking about running a "full node").
Miners already have an insane amount of power. They are the sole decider of which transactions get taken up into which blocks. I don't see how arbitrarily neutering block size solves that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:05:42


Heh. Try doing it. Yes, moving a million is easy because who cares if you pay $40 to make it into the next block? For the average person, however, BTC fees are untenable. Just transferring my BTC to alternate cryptocurrencies has murdered me in fees
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:54:04
Interesting. I guess I shouldn't have bothered replying at all. I thought you were interested in actual discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:39:57


Yes. Everyone has to make their own judgement. Personally I can't handle the fees associated with the 1-1.7MB blocks of BTC. This is because I actually used BTC as a currency (at times) in the past, which means that I have a lot of unspent transaction outputs which inflates transaction size. Someone who only HODLs and only has 1 output will have a better time with fees (but will still take a small haircut).
From a code beauty standpoint, I don't like segwit. Transaction malleability is something to be addressed, sure, but the roundabout block size increase is really ugly. It's a block size increase disguised as a block weight decrease (a segwit byte weighs less than a nonsegwit byte). I also don't like that the BTC core team is not focused at all on making on-chain transactions affordable (yes, they're developing LN steadily, but it's not the solution I want. I want blockchain transactions for all the benefits of decentralization, censorship resistance etc that I got into BTC for)
So my BTC became 50% BCH 50% XMR. We'll see how it pans out. If I lose money, whatever, at least I'm insulated from the liquidity risk inherent in BTC's sluggish transaction confirmations (I refuse to let coinbase, etc have my private keys so off-chain transactions aren't an option when liquidating).
It just depends which vision of Bitcoin you agree with. A road forks, do you go left or right? A good strategy is to look ahead, which is why I recommend that everybody make their own judgements. If you're happy with where BTC is going then there's nothing wrong with holding it.
[A quick digression regarding BCH - ignore all the bullshit about Roger Ver, etc. He's inconsequential in the scheme of things and is really just a distraction measure used by BTC supporters to prevent people from looking at the differences between two 99.9% similar Bitcoin chains. The BCH/BTC debate is fundamentally about different development visions. One wants to be a p2p currency, the other wants to be a settlement layer for various 'faster' layers built on top. That vision itself isn't flawed, but I don't believe you can build a sleek payment layer (LN) on top of a sluggish, horribly expensive base layer (the blockchain with its neutered block-size)]
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:02:11
No, not all alts. All coins will have fees rise with higher tx thruput, but the ones that scale blocksize will be fine.
Other coins like XMR, which uses ring signatures, have much larger transactions. This also leads to higher fees, but XMR is planning an adaptive blocksize + some transaction size improvements which will help considerably.
There's probably coins that are better than BCH from a technological perspective. For example, faster block mining is pretty cool (although BCH may lower the block time to 1-2.5 minutes, which would achieve that). The main advantage of BCH is it's the exact same infrastructure as BTC, so a switch can occur relatively painlessly. (emphasis on "relatively", because if BCH does win the tug-of-war then some people are going to lose their shirts. However after that painful period everything could get back on track. The most important thing is adoption, which is where BTC is negative currently.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:21:12

Moore's law is always at play. Even if the constant changes, we shouldn't expect the pattern of exponential computing power growth to change. If it ever does stop growing exponentially, then it will be time to go all-in on layer two.
Until then, the intelligent approach is an expanded blocksize to allow on-chain transactions to actually work, and *then* you build further layers on top of a stable base layer. What BTC is trying to do is build a sexy second layer on top of a shitty, aids-ridden blockchain. That approach is doomed to fail, even ignoring that LN will never be as decentralized as the Bitcoin network itself is
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:20:29


Could you explain your reasoning? To me, fees that prohibit using BTC for small transactions means that those that hold the BTC *are* the speculators
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:58:54
The “full node” (more accurately called non-mining node) argument is FUD. It’s **miners** who are vulnerable to centralixation, because miners control the bitcoin network.
If compromising “non-mining nodes” (also called full nodes) hurts the network, then Bitcoin is easy to attack because it’s easier to get 51% of ‘“full-blockchain non-mining nodes” than it is to get 51% hashpower.
tl;dr BTC and BCH are both vulnerable to hashpower centralization. Non-mining nodes are irrelevant, they don’t process transactions nor secure the network.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:48:14
They will, but block size matters. BTC can only fit ~1.7MB in a block (+- a few tenths of a MB)
Which scales better - a network that can handle 6 tx/sec, or one that can handle 24 tx/sec, and potentially higher? I chose the latter, personally, but it's up to you depending on your vision for BTC (is it a settlement layer or an actual p2p cash replacement?)
Different strokes for different folks. I want people in Venezuela to be able to actually use Bitcoin to evade oppression. Other people want Bitcoin to be primarily an investment asset for the rich.

It's realistic at current levels, but the assumption is that mining profitability won't change. I'd recommend looking at mining profitability charts - looking at the past doesn't always help, but it will give you a rough idea of what to expect. (My internet connection isn't great right now otherwise I'd look it up myself, assuming the charts actually exist).


I mean, having previously paid for the electricity doesn't effect your profit calculation, since otherwise you just wouldn't be paying for the extra electricity. However, as a learning exercise, it could be a great lesson. Most people don't understand how mining works, so it'd be a good motivator to dig deep into it (in a nutshell, a miner randomly guesses values, then runs the value through a sha256 hash function until the output begins with the correct amount of leading zeroes. why they do this is the real important part).
So my advice is, if you're itching to try it out, go for it, but treat it as paying money to learn about mining, and if it does end up generating profit (after expenses) then buy yourself a nice bitcoin beer

if you want BTC but with better transaction fees/times...then you want BCH. Otherwise, my advice is to look at altcoins. There's other bitcoin forks, but I haven't heard of one besides BCH that brings anything real to the table

So, support BCH devs? ;)
Seriously though. What is BTC core doing to improve network throughput, besides segwit/LN? Segwit is fine but only gives a &lt;100% increase. Increasing block size up to a max of 1 gigabyte would allow what, 3000 transactions per second?
Perhaps you think LN is the answer, but I'd rather scale on-chain. LN has a number of issues. For example, even opening a small LN will be prohibitively expensive if TX fees don't get addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:26:54
It's a colloquial phrase meaning losing money. In this case you wouldn't literally lose money, but your mining reward will go down exponentially over time. However if the BTC price matches the hashpower increases, which it generally would, then you will still be making the same amount of profit.

Satoshi's own words disprove that assertion, considering he believed the average user would use SPV clients or something similar.
The issue is that "full nodes" don't have any say in which transactions get included. And it doesn't really help that they "verify" transactions when every client needs to verify the transaction history themselves (not the whole tx history in the case of SPV but they still need to verify the relevant transactions). Hashpower rules in the bitcoin ecosystem.

So much FUD around full-blockchain non-mining nodes (full nodes). They don’t secure the network, only minimg nodes do.

Uh, aren't you misrepresenting how markets work?
If I want to buy BCH, I need a seller. So the price skyrocketing implies that there were not enough limit sell orders, not that there were too few buy orders.
Come on, this is basic markets. There's no way for the price to rise if the sell walls are large enough.
Anyway, the current GDAX price is meaningless since trading is offline. Wait till tomorrow to get a clearer view.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:55:32
How are you so sure? We haven't hit that scale yet. As of right now, we just need to track the average TX growth (counting TXs with fees above some value epsilon) and have blocksize mirror that growth. Even with 100% growth y/y we would be fine for quite some time, certainly long enough to develop off chain solutions if necessary
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:21:32
It wasn't about implementation difficulty. Bitcoin Core just does not want bigger blocks, period. The 70% boost of segwit is probably the largest we'll see for quite some time.
And now if BTC does adapt its blocksize, then it's really weird, because it implies BCH wasn't wrong after all...
Truly a scary situation for BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:29:11


A fork is a fork. If we have one blockchain, with a given history up to block N, and then we fork at N, now we have one blockchain (let's call it BTC) and another blockchain (let's call it BCH). BTC and BCH share the same blockchain up to N. All blocks after N will be different. This is exactly what a fork is, so if it makes you feel more secure to call it an altcoin, go ahead, but it's a very different matter. We're talking about protocols that are nearly identical, the obvious exceptions being blocksize, segwit, difficulty adjustments.


Come on, this is just pedantry. I know what electronic cash means. An asymmetric key system with $10000 transaction fees is technically electronic cash, what I'm referring to is digital money that is *the digital equivalent of physical cash*. In other words, the USD doesn't have transaction fees (in cash) [ignoring implicitly subsidizing credit card users for stores that don't offer cash discounts]. Thus a blockchain with $7 transction fees is a lot less usable as cash than one with $.07 tx fees.


This is false, unless your definition of trust is very limited. 


What? You're a decentralized systems engineer and you don't see that as scary? I just gave you an example where 100% of the blockchain allows me to censor any other transactions I want. With proper decentralization, it doesn't matter because the nonmalicious miners will eventually take in my transaction if the fees aren't way too low. With centralization, you can be censored.


Let's keep the discussion concrete. I don't belong to any side, I just hold the cryptos where I believe in the technology and dev teams. What specific parts of the protocol do you think I don't understand?
You claimed that a simple blocksize increase is some sort of massive change. It's not. 8MB blocks are running fine on the BCH mainnet. Yes, it's still early, etc etc.
I don't have a perfect understanding of BTC, but to give one example, I don't think your understanding of it massively surpasses mine, if it does so at all. Regardless, you seem to be spending less and less time talking technology and more and more time questioning your 'opponent'. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:07:35
lmfao. That's what I'm currently paying with BTC as well.
You clearly haven't sent a BCH transaction, otherwise you wouldn't claim you paid the same fees, considering BCH is like $.01 compared to $30. I'm not great at math, but I don't think those are the same number

The Core devs are a small subset of BTC devs. They didn't build bitcoin (they contributed plenty, but Satoshi gets the lion share of the credit, as well as others like hal finney assuming they're different entities), and have used very dubious methods to suppress hard forks. Consensus is about consensus of the bitcoin community as a whole, not just the opinions of Core (and by extension, and bitcoin.org)
Increasing block-size increases transaction throughput linearly. This is an issue, because bitcoin grows exponentially. However, there's some other things you probably haven't considered:
1) Due to moore's law, we can expect data storage to grow exponentially as well. So they should already be able to somewhat equalize, although the constants may be different (btc may be growing % wise far faster than storage capacity is).
2) If Bitcoin value goes up exponentially, then the amount of funding available for nodes should go up at the same rate.
3) Solutions like LN require more time. They're not ready to deploy yet. The BCH approach allows the network to be useable in the mean time, giving some breathing room for developers to be able to add other capacity increases in a more careful manner.
I think it's pretty clear that BCH can at least scale up to 1 GB/block in the next decade. And when LN is ready to deploy, it can be extended to BCH, making transaction fees still far lower than BTC.
You conceded that the BTC block size must increase, but then why has it taken so long? The only capacity increase has been segwit, which is nice but has not solved the issue.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:28
They probably chose a high fee to make sure it got in the next block. I've paid $30 transaction fees.

Oh, really? What about the mempool (for the naive, the mempool is the unconfirmed transactions that are held in the memory of non-mining nodes, etc).
The average satoshi/byte fee now is massive. Even 100 satoshi/byte is way too low these days without using a tx accelerator

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:19:19
Actually, they're not entirely wrong. At a given difficulty level, more hashpower = more blocks mined = more transactions go through the network.
The problem is that difficulty adjustments seek to maintain 1 block every 10 minutes. Thus increasing hashpower only works for a short time, and then the problem comes back even worse. This is happening to BTC right now.
There's no way to scale on-chain transactions without a blocksize increase. Unfortunately, propaganda has made the average user here view "big blocks" as a bad word
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:31
Can we discuss specifics?
Nobody wanted civil war. It increases the risk to all of our holdings. Unfortunately it became inevitable when the visions for Bitcoin diverged. The software repos diverging was bound to happen after the real fork - the fork in visions - happened.
I didn't convert to BCH with glee, I converted because I was beyond frustrated that my BTC had become untransactable, and furthermore that this was viewed as a *feature* of BTC. It was about risk reduction. So if I end up with some profit (assuming BCH adoption keeps surging), then I'll be happy, but profit was never the motive.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:00:05
My point is that quicker blocks have the same effect as larger blocks if blocksize doesn't change. Thus if you believe blocksize must remain static, then clearly litecoin is a foolish choice.


This is just a lie. I can use BCH more than I can use, say, BTG (is that the ticker?)

My guess is BCH will emerge the victor in this very unfortunate civil war. That's why a good chunk of my BTC became BCH. But obviously, I am biased.
Momentum is favoring BCH in terms of adoption. To me, that is the most important metric.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:04:51
slight correction: depends on the transaction size, which mainly depends on the number of inputs/outputs.

@_date: 2017-12-05 05:43:23
for your tx to get approved, it needs to be at least the Nth highest bid, where N is the # of transactions that can fit into a block.
When you expand the block size, you expand the transaction capacity and thereby increase the value of N.
Here's where I'll diverge from the bitcoin core (the dev team) consensus. What segwit does is increase block size in a roundabout way. They define a new term called weight that allows them to consider witness data to be 25% of the weight, even if it occupies 100% of the same memory. So functionally some different accounting expands the block size to functionally somewhere around ~1.7 MB or so, maybe higher with full adoption.
The other approach is to say fuck the weird accounting and just increase the maximum allowable blocksize. This also increases the value of N (which determines transaction capacity), but has the advantage that you can go *way* past the modest increase of segwit. Right now that means ~8MB, but up to 1GB and higher is plausible. The important part is that you don't need to scale the block size from 1MB to 1GB, you can just match the rate of growth of transactions above a certain minimum fee level. This would undoubtedly allow transactions to proceed smoothly for a few years until other solutions (LN or some newer system) are put in place.
The common "core" argument is that this hurts decentralization, because it makes it more cost-prohibitive to run full nodes, etc. Personally I think if you look at the rate of storage growth, it's also exponential, so we'd be unlikely to run into issues, but if they did arise they could be addressed via future forks. [As an aside, the hysteria over hard forks really needs to end. They are a healthy part of the ecosystem]
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:49:03
I see those numbers as very feasible 5-10 years down the line. You’re also assuming no LN, etc, not to mention that 24000tx/sec is massive. That’s visa peak capacity, not average.

To me, that shouldn't destroy the network *until* the price implodes, whereas right now we're watching it degrade slowly before the bubble has even popped (if it will).
I first saw bitcoin when it was &lt;$1. I didn't have any money though, so I didn't acquire most btc till &gt;$1000. I do remember I had ~.46 BTC that I acquired mining, which I sent to a friend because it wasn't worth anything at the time, which obv would now be worth like 4-5k (so still not very much all things considered). 
I'm not worried about the network dying to transaction capacity - or at least I'm not worried about BCH. I'm not a fan of where BTC is going but who knows if they'll end up caving and increasing block size directly. What I am worried about is the same thing you are:

What you're imagining is really the idea of forks in general. You "vote" by siding with a given fork. When a certain faction gains too much control, like Bitcoin Core as a timely example, then forks arise to remedy this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:04
If you mean send actual bitcoin, and not start with USD and get bitcoin with the GDAX route...then you're kinda shit out of luck. .005 BTC will barely cover the fee to move the money around at all quickly.
You can try setting a low fee (like 100 satoshis/byte), and wait for the mempool to clear enough for your transaction to go through. If it doens't go through, you either wait for it to drop out of the mempool or pay for child with parent (note that paying child w/ parent is prob impossible with only .005 BTC anyway)

At best, full control of all non-mining nodes lets you censor transaction broadcast. However you cannot arbitrarily modify the blockchain, or double spend, or anything else.

Not sure if you're downvoting me or if it's somebody else but I'm a little confused why.
Anyway, can you clarify why it was part of the solution? The concept of making the transaction ID not dependent on the signature is fine. Why does it require the new "block weight" which considers segwit data to weigh less than the rest of the block by kb? It seems to me like a roundabout block size increase, unless there's something I'm missing that you'd care to explain
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:51:30
Yes, but they do so of their own free will. In other words, a miner could choose to put no transactions in a block, just for shits and giggles. Thus nodes have no power
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:33:00
How? Genuinely want to know how you're doing it. And if you don't mind, links to some tx's would be great.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:37
Please do the math. Fees are determined by the top 2000-6000 bidders(based on tx size / segwit adoption).
Dust transactions, ie transactions that do not get included in the blockchain, do not raise fees. How could they? They never got in the blockchain.
Fees are a bidding war. All that matters is what the top transactions are paying.  In other words, you’re looking bottom up instead of top down.
Thus if these BTC fees are an attack from an external enemy (they’re not), that attacker must pay considerable amounts of btc continuously to inflate prices.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:34:44
Nobody, but that is very difficult, because you only need a few nodes to keep the network running. Critically, taking down all non-mining nodes would prevent tx from being broadcast, but it would have no effect on the underlying blockchain. For example, controlling all the non-mining nodes would not allow you to double spend.
Remember, there is no profit incentive for running a non-mining node. Therefore there is not much investment, and a nation-state could easily achieve 95% non-mining node control. However 100% would be very difficult although I suppose you could just DDOS the remaining nodes.
On the other hand, achieving 95% hashpower is infeasible. 51% is still quite doable for a nation-state however (I would assume)
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:27:28
You're getting close here.
The blockchain itself grows exponentially - that's a fact. However, storage, processing power etc also grow exponentially - that's the whole point of Moore's Law. Moore's law may come to an end, but it hasn't yet. Even if the rate of growth slows down, as long as it's exponential that's a very good sign that we can scale onchain.


Eventually, no. At 8MB, however, sure it can. As block-size increases, the computing power and storage space available for a given amount of money will increase as well.


We have more than two miners, and mining is way more centralize able than nodes. It really doesn't matter all that much if a company has a large portion of BTC nodes, since they don't decide the transactions (only miners do). Now with, say, 99% of nodes, then you could perhaps censor transactions, but not as effectively as directly censoring at the mining level.
I forgot to mention, LN etc can be brought on as well to help the tx pressure. However, LN is not workable unless blocksize is already increased so that you don't get murdered by fees when establishing and closing the LN

If you're against forks in general, you're against decentralized, open software development, which is the very thing that gave birth to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-05 05:45:11
But, unfortunately, they will be much less than can be achieved by outright block size improvements. It is doubtful that segwit will allow more than a 100% boost in tx throughput (that's me being generous), whereas using an 8mb bitcoin fork allows 8x more transactions.

The bitcoin network forked into BTC and BCH (there's dozens of other forks but BCH is the important one).
Which one you should buy depends on your vision for Bitcoin. Personally, I value on-chain transactions, and don't want to be forced thru middlemen (lightning hubs). So for me choosing BCH was natural.
The difference is that BTC has segwit and RBF and 1.7MB max blocks w/ full segwit adoption, BCH has I believe 8MB blocks now with scalability up to 32MB without another fork. There will be more forks down the road to increase that cap as needed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:56:11
Hmm, there are a few things here that don't sound quite right.


Mempool transactions do actually get dropped out of the mempool if fees are too low and the mempool is too clogged. But in general it's just a delay, yes.


So, the miners produce the blocks, and the non-mining nodes exist to relay them. Thus with 100% control, you can prevent the network from relaying newly found blocks, but you're not actually modifying the blockchain. You're just preventing people from finding out about the blockchain's most recent state. Note that I'm not even convinced you can censor block distribution in this way because you only need a fraction of "honest" non-mining nodes to distribute. Plus miners can propagate blocks/transactions themselves, unless my understanding is way off.


That is exactly the crux of the issue. What power do non-mining nodes really have? My position is very little, as was intended by Satoshi. If non-miners did have enormous power, it would be far cheaper for a nation-state to take control of 99.9% of non-mining nodes than it would be to take control of 99% of hashpower.


They can't produce blocks, because they don't mine, and mining is directly the activity that produces blocks and therefore processes transactions.
What non-mining nodes do is relay transactions to other nodes, and hold unconfirmed tx in their mempool, so that mining nodes can worry about mining and then rely on the non-miners to figure out what transactions are available to be put into blocks (and then greedily sort by highest sat/byte fee to maximize profit).
Bitcoin has a simple principle: where there is profit incentive, there is power, and vice versa. This makes it so that free-market dynamics lead to the network being strengthened against attack. These dynamics do not exist with non-mining nodes, which is why Satoshi didn't even have the concept in his whitepaper ( what he called nodes are miners, which makes for confusion when Core supporters quote parts of the whitepaper and pretend he's talking about full-blockchain non-mining nodes [full nodes] )

I agree most leave it in exchanges. However even if only .01% are storing their own BTC, the relative increase as net users grow *will* lead to higher fees. It's inevitable.
It's certainly not being used for drugs anymore (fees prohibitive), so there's that.

As far as the last time, I have no idea, but you can look at the mempool to get an idea of how many blocks it'd take at the current level.
Since there's over 100,000 tx in the mempool, we won't see 1 sat/byte for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:08:04
Are those with 100% segwit transactions? I'm curious what the max block size is (as are you obviously). I know it's hard to pin a precise # because it depends on how much space the transaction data vs witness data takes up.
I don't understand why segwit relies on block weight instead of blocksize. I understand how weight allows a block size increase without calling it a blocksize increase, but to me it seems weird to me the way it's allocated. My understanding is that we have 1MB for transaction data, and then up to 3MB of witness data? Or something similar? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:18:07
Classic. Refusing to discuss the actual technology of Bitcoin.
What tx fees have you been sending? For me they’re $4-30 based on mempool, currently $30 for fast confirmation
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:14:31


a $30 fee, for example, is really not much better than a wire transfer until you get to large amounts. I doubt $200 would be cheaper to send on BTC than with the bank
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:56:16
Your logic doesn't make sense, really. The only way to spam the network with fees without losing money is to own 100% hashpower, in which case Bitcoin is already dead.
To increase transaction fees maliciously, you must submit your own high fee transactions that get taken into blocks. Transactions with fees too low to make it in the block don't affect fee price.
So no, bigger blocks aren't any more vulnerable to spam. I'm a believer in not confirming 0-fee transactions, but otherwise filling up blocks with transactions above a minimum fee level. This basically already happens since miners greedily select by fee.
There's also some ambiguity in what people mean by spam attacks. You can spam a lot of bullshit transactions to try to clog the mempool of nodes, but you can't "spam" fees up without paying dearly for doing so, as I explained above
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:25
There's a broader issue of deflation vs inflation, it may be that a deflationary currency is not viable long-term. This makes sense but it's hard to know since so much of our current system is based on inflation and debt (both of which are healthy in the right amounts in my opinion).
anyway, to me the crux of the issue is you can't build better layers on top of shitty layers. you need an effective blockchain to be able to do stuff like LN without paying an arm and a leg

Forks aren't scary. They're fun! We can fork whenever a real upgrade is needed. If there's not consensus, the fork dies.
As one example, BTC/BCH split. BCH has enough support to remain alive in the shadow of its slightly uglier but nearly identical big brother. (Technically, BTC isn't BCH's big brother, they're more like identically aged clones with small DNA mutations, but the analogy works)

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:43


Many of us supported Segwit2x. And we all know what happened there. That whole situation was basically proof a hard fork is necessary (in the eyes of the BCH fork side of course).






Unless I misunderstand it, this is a stunning mischaracterization on your part. Quadratic hashing refers to the time required to validate a *given transaction*, of which the hard limit is 1MB (from what I've read, I haven't doublechecked the codebase). The actual attack would still only require a matter of seconds to process a 1MB transaction. It's difficult to see how the attack would matter in that scenario, especially given how massive the fees would be on the BTC blockchain. Obviously, all that being said O(n) is better than O(n^2) so a fix like that is always good. But it's not nearly as pressing as the broader issue of tx fees / the growing mempool.

It's not intellectually asinine at all. It used to be everyone understood that 1MB was a temporary cap, and blocksize would have to increase.

That's a matter of opinion.
What is inarguable is that if non-mining nodes are critical to network security, then Bitcoin has a big problem, because it's quite trivial to create a bunch of nodes, whereas it is quite difficult to gain majority hashpower
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:46:24
So to beat out your transaction, if our tx’s are equal size in bytes, I just need to pay eleven cents, or maybe fifteen.
Whereas to use BTC now, I pay no less than $10 per tx.
Transactions cost money, for you to ‘ddos’ the network with spam transactions, you must pay high enough fees to out compete legitimate users. That isn’t sustainable when blocksize is healthy because you’d have to pay too much to run the attack
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:04:28
tx fees: currently around $7 per tx for pretty average transactions, they might spike in the next days/weeks given the frenzy of trading but I'm not sure
exchange fees: depends on the exchange. I'd expect at least .25-1%.
I guess those numbers aren't terrible if you have a few hundred to throw. Just be aware this is a somewhat dangerous (or perhaps volatile would be a better word) time to get into it. As long as you're willing to lose a very significant percentage of your money, it's a very good learning experience.
My advice would be to spend the time you're waiting to receive your BTC on reading up on the fundamental technology, and not just refreshing the bitcoin price page constantly. And when I say fundamentals, I mean the whitepaper and associated encryption theory behind it (concepts you need to understand in loose order: hashing -&gt; proof of work/mining (why it's necessary / sha256 as the specific PoW algo) -&gt; blockchain / merkle trees -&gt; block size)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:28
Both. Exact same PoW as BTC, just different difficulty.

So what if one fork has better features than another fork? For example, let's say fork A can process 6tx/sec and fork B can process, I don't know, 24tx/sec?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:33:26
The whitepaper is a great place to start. The most important is strong crypto fundamentals, so asymmetric key crytography (public/private key cryptography), hashing, proof of work, etc. For bitcoin specific stuff you should learn about sha256 (the pow algo), merkle trees (what we call the blockchain), etc. For deeper stuff, Monero uses ring signatures which I'm still learning about - those seem quite interesting
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:35:09




Only makes sense with majority hashpower, in which case you already have ridiculous influence over BTC


Yes, this is analogous to a whale price pumping, as I said. (edit: oops, the whale-price-pumping thing was from a different comment. In short, it takes capital to artificially raise either network fees or the BTC price. So fee pumping is analogous to a whale pumping the price of BTC, in terms of how it works) Also as I said, to perform the attack you have to pay the fees. It only becomes "profitable" with huge hashpower


Yes, you can certainly make the mempool look bigger. That's definitely true.
It makes sense as an attack on BTC (not trying to profit), but it doesn't seem better than other attack vectors (say, trying to compromise Bitcoin Core developer credentials, or trying to accumulate a majority of hashpower, or infiltrating a wallet client to subtly set higher fees. These are all stretches, of course, and particularly trying to accumulate hashpower is unrealistic unless you're a nation-state).
In short, attacking fees is theoretically possible, but IMO is not what's causing high tx fees. What's causing high tx fees is the fact that 1.1-1.7MB is not a lot of space
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:24:11
Bullshit. It was never instant, but it was basically free for 99% of its existence, until BTC got taken over by 'leaders' who don't believe in the blockchain for transactions.
When did you get into BTC? When I got in, tx fees were cents. Now they're $3-30 per tx
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:28:03
Yes, I agree with all that (not sure if Bitcoin being deflationary will be a problem, but it's a minor point). The main issue is that we have a fork of BTC, known as BCH, which has all of those but also has far lower transaction fees due to a higher transaction capacity as a result of a higher block size limit.
Personally, I've found the $3-10 transaction fees to be untenable, and have switched over to BCH. I recognize that's not a popular opinion here. I believe LN to be a useful idea, but one that doesn't work without low transaction fees, otherwise the cost to establish the LN network is still too high to compete.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:19:12
That's just dogma. How can LN scale to the whole world \* off of a 6-7 tx/sec cap on the actual blockchain?
\* and also ideally maintain BTC's decentralized properties, such as not being able to get transactions censored

Bitcoin won't die. It just might have a new flashy green logo instead.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:14:52
Bitcoin is almost a decade old. It should not be unusable for transactions.
We've seen with Bitcoin Cash that increasing the block-size works, with (in my opinion) no weakness in the underlying decentralization of the network (in fact, I view BTC as becoming frighteningly centralized). BTC could implement this change *today* if there were consensus.
I reject all analogies to companies and brands. These are different situations. Yes, BTC people are mad because they are worried about people confusing BTC. However, I don't view it as a problem because the reason BTC vs BCH is potentially "confusable" is that they are nearly identical. The only functional differences are block size and segwit, right (ignoring market cap, trade volume etc)? [If worried about capital outflows from BTC due to confusion, I find this unlikely. A handful of users accidentally buying 1 BCH instead of BTC has no impact on the overall market cap. BTC price action is determined by the whales and by the hordes of smaller buyers, and those trends won't change]
If BTC can't even fork to 8 MB blocks (or implement a solution that gives a similar capacity increase without compromising security/decentralization), it will remain only useable for speculation.
In terms of userbase, 99.9% of bitcoin users just want to make some USD. They are familiar with terms like 'blockchain' but have no idea what it actually means. They've never heard of sha256, they don't understand the relation between confirmations and block mining nor the relation between block size and transaction capacity, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:35
Weird. Try a diff client like electrum, or build the transaction manually.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:26
In transaction fees and confirmation times, BTC is losing very, very badly. I say this as someone who still owns BTC (but has transferred a bunch into BCH and XMR)
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:02:21


Good luck with that :P Lightning is great, but it should not be the only way to send money. Also for it to work you need cheap on-chain transactions to establish and close lightning accounts.
Thus I view LN as a distraction until block size increases for real. Plus, I don't buy that it will be decentralized. I think we'll see a small amount of centralized hubs, which is right back to the banking system that I've been trying to avoid.
In short, I'm a proponent of slow exponential block size increase with features like LN, etc getting developed at the same time. This gives the best of both worlds (BCH and BTC's strategies respectively)

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:09:38


Close. I like that we're talking time complexity. However your model isn't complete.
Bitcoin usage grows exponentially (under ideal circumstances). This requires an exponential increase in blocksize, since as you said the relation is linear between blocksize and tx throughput.
So, why is this not a problem? In short, because computing power, storage costs etc also improve exponentially. They might have different "constants", but since they're both exponential, they will cancel out.
There's also a related issue which is that Bitcoin Core proponents, in my opinion, completely misunderstand what makes Bitcoin decentralized. Decentralization is about hashpower distribution, not about "full nodes" (which is an oxymoron because in the BTC whitepaper, a node is a *miner*, not a non-mining node. Non-miners have *no* say in which transactions get into blocks, and thus have *no effect* on the security of the network. They're just there to hold unconfirmed tx in memory and help relay them to the miners, who do the actual transaction processing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:18:14
70%, roughly. Max segwit adoption should be around 1.7MB blocks.

What transactions have you sent recently? What fees did you pay, and how many UTXOs were you spending (what was the tx size in bytes)?
I ask because I am/was an actual BTC user. Since I've **actually used the currency** that everyone on this subreddit incessantly defends, my BTC is locked up in different outputs, rather than one single output like if I'd bought into BTC once on coinbase and never used it.
The fees I've paid in the last month range from $3 to $40 (the $40 when I was forced to pay for child w/ parent). I have a consolidation transaction (intended to consolidate my BTC to a single address when the mempool clears, if it ever does) with a $9 fee that won't confirm whatsoever because it's only 50 satoshis per byte.
So, tell me again that no real users find the fees untenable. It just shows how disconnected you are from what BTC was actually used for years ago, and what the vision was.
Everyone here cares more about their YTD return than they do the plight of, say, those in Venezuela (hyperinflation, capital controls, rampant violence in the form of kidnappings, robberies, and government killings), or people in Africa who have no access to the international banking system
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:42
Are BTC's tires being slashed? Driving up transaction fees artificially means paying those same fees yourself.
What's more likely, a massive and expensive attack by increasing fee prices (perhaps Roger Ver is spamming the BTC network with 200 satoshi/byte transactions), or that bitcoin's increased usage led to the "temporary" 1MB block size limit not allowing enough transactions to go through?
inb4 "shill". I've held BTC longer than 98% of this sub but I can't even discuss the technology - you know, merkle trees, public/private keys, the linear relation between block size and tx throughput, the fact that miners are the ones securing the network and thus miners are the source of centralization risk - without having the discussion get totally destroyed by accusatory shill comments (I've lost count of how many times I've been called a foreign shill), random BS about Roger Ver (who I don't give a fuck about), or unsupported claims (big blocks = centralization, non-mining nodes are what secure the network, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:06:15
The Core approach is fine if you like it, but I prefer the BCH approach of steady block size increases and not shying away from hard forks. To me it's more faithful to how decentralized software development is supposed to work. When you have one faction telling everybody that hard forks are to be avoided at all costs, to me that's a big warning flag. But I know many people on this subreddit agree with the Core stance.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:35:18
The simple answer is nowhere. You will never find an unbiased forum to discuss cryptocurrencies, so you need to get used to finding things out for yourself and making your own judgements. Most cryptocurrencies have a whitepaper which is a good starting point, but sometimes the white paper is either too dense, or it's just nonsensical (I read the first like 20% of iota's whitepaper and it was a complete clusterfuck).
Start with the technology, if there's no technological or network advancements then the cryptocurrency is largely useless. So as one example, Monero has some really interesting features with ring signatures that offer benefits for certain use cases. Also think about usability - as one example, I no longer hold BTC due to transaction fees (an unpopular opinion around these parts).
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:53:30
The majority is a tenuous concept. Clearly if there's a fork, there is dissension in the community. That's okay, forks aren't bad - they're a healthy part of open, decentralized software development. Note that BTC as it is now is mainly under the control of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core did not invent bitcoin, nor did they write the initial code. They just happened to take the project over after Satoshi left the scene.
So, on this subreddit, the "consensus" is known to be segwit+LN+rbf, etc. But consensus inside an echo chamber is not real consensus.


Pretty much. Different blockchain, different coin. With BCH/BTC, they share the same blockchain up until the day of the split. Thus they are competing versions of Bitcoin, and are more accurately considered bitcoin forks (as opposed to, say, BCH being an "altcoin").


That's the principle of decentralization - you must verify everything for yourself, or you are not secure. So, can the human users of Bitcoin really do that? Probably not, which is why we have our current herd mentality.

It's theoretically cheaper fees, but it sacrifices the decentralization aspect.

Yes, he did. Would you like me to dig up the quote? He was quite confident that BTC could scale to Visa levels solely through blocksize increases. The 1MB limit was a temporary spam/DDOS protection measure.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:44:15


Standard users use electrum, or some equivalent light wallet. These are not perfect but they're good enough for 99% of users. Most people don't even understand BTC proof of work or asymmetric key cryptography, I guarantee you that *today* most BTC users are not running "full nodes".


Of course it's a large attack vector, my point is that the risks are inherent to both BTC and BCH, and indeed any network that uses a similar proof-of-work system. It's part of the design; we'll probably discover a better protocol in the medium-long term but it takes time.
We already see the massive mining power in China, right? That's an issue that exists right now. 


Segwit kicks the can a tiny bit down the road. A &lt;=80% transaction capacity boost is nice, but not nearly as much as an 800% or 8000% increase (associated with 8MB or 80MB blocks respectively).
I put 1GB out there because we wouldn't reach 1GB for 5 years+. I think that's a conservative guess, because if transaction capacity doubles every year then we only need an increase on the order of 2^5 = 32x, which would only be 32 MB if we're starting from 1MB or 256 MB if we're starting from 8MB. That's a lot of breathing room. And remember the block size limit should be increased gradually, not all at once.
And if as you say, we're nowhere near critical adoption, which I also believe is true, then you should be quite frightened at BTC's capacity considering *right now* tx fees are $4-10.


Individuals can still run full nodes right now with BCH. It's absolutely doable with a normal computer. Most people just don't want to. It's a simple rule, though: do you have a lot of BTC, BCH, etc? Then run your own node and keep yourself safe. Otherwise, run a light client.


What did he suggest specifically? The only proposal I remember was to go down to a smaller blocksize, like .3 MB and then scale back up to a MB (I may be remembering wrong)

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:49:42
None. The accusation makes no sense. Spam transactions (low fee transactions) drop out of the mempool naturally. Only the highest fee transactions impact the fee rate. So if you bid the 15000th highest fee, you won't make it in within one block because you can't fit 15000 tx in a block.
Any attack to increase the network fees necessarily involves paying the fees yourself. It's like running up the Bitcoin price as a whale - you have to smash through the resistance with capital
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:19:53

BTC can only process a max of around 7 tx/sec. There are many more transactions than that, so fees are high (you have to pay more than the other guy to get your transaction in). The only way to improve this is to handle transactions off-chain (lightning network) or expand the throughput (block size increase, like segwit but bigger)
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:40:56


BTC was built by people trying to get away from fiat. We have low enough TX fees to use cryptocurrencies to transact (as long as you use BCH or litecoin, etc instead of BTC), it's all about adoption at this point.
Unfortunately core seems convinced that they *are* BTC, apparently having forgotten that they *inherited the codebase* as an indirect result of satoshi going dark.

No. The Japanese name was not to take credit. It was to mask the identity further / just a cool name.
Satoshi understood anonymity. They wouldn't give away such a big clue as to their country of origin. Also Satoshi wrote in English, never Japanese. Japanese BTC support was added way later

This isn't really true; you can send your bitcoin to an address that nobody controls, it's basically gone.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:04:51
I’d suggest rereading Satoshi’s words. He’s directly talking about on-chain scaling.
You seem to be confused about the term “node”. Satoshi calls miners nodes, because what btc core calls “full nodes” don’t secure the network whatsoever. Only *mining nodes* (miners) do.
As should be obvious, we *do* have large datacenters for miners. This is an inevitable result of the profit incentive for mining.
LN is a fine idea, but not workable with tiny (full) blocks.
edit: you said he never said btc could scale to visa levels? Here’s the quote again:


@_date: 2017-12-05 21:34:43
If BCH had the same number of TX/s flowing through the network, fees would still be lower. This is an indisputable fact, so go ahead and argue against it if you wish, but the math disagrees.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:41:13


You can prefer bitcoin all you want, I get it, but I don't think it's reasonable to consider something like the US dollar a "bad investment". And you won't be able to buy stocks without fiat anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:02:41


Don't feel overwhelmed, nobody does. If your mind is open to learning about the raw structure of Bitcoin (/ decentralized systems in general), you will be far ahead of the curve. My understanding is well above average and I still would never have been brilliant enough to give birth to BTC.
If we're just talking about the BCH/BTC debate, then look into transaction throughput of the bitcoin network. You'll find it's a linear function of blocksize * blocks per unit time. Thus, to increase tx capacity, there's only two things that can be done - increase the blocksize, or decrease block time. (or option 3, optimize transaction size, but that approach only works for so long).
Most people don't understand what BTC mining is doing, or how it strengthens the network. That's a great place to start if you're looking to learn.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:37:48


Simple. LN doesn't "do it cheaper" because it's not in use yet. I also do not believe that LN represents more decentralization. It's exactly the opposite, really.


Because verification is cheap.

Centralist thinking...your comments are dripping with it
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:06:04
Not that it matters, but how long have you been involved with Bitcoin? Have you read the original whitepaper?
Maybe I'm a bitcoin purist, but I believe cryptocurrencies should be transactable. In other words, I should be able to send transactions without large delays or massive fees. $3-7 fees are massive, they make it only viable to use btc for large transactions.
BTC has such tiny blocks that it's making it increasingly unusable for what the original vision was. Instead it's becoming a "digital store of value". That's great, but a store of value isn't very useful to a lot of the world if its only purpose is price speculation.
Bitcoin is not owned by anyone on this subreddit, nor by the core developers. It's not even owned by Satoshi. Right now we have two forks of bitcoin with very similar market cap, very similar underlying structure except bch has far lower fees due to larger blocks. So why are you so quick to label everything else an altcoin? To me it seems like insecurity.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:35:03
Does it mean the TX fee is $5? That seems likely, given how high BTC tx fees are right now. If so, then the total fee is coinbase fees + TX fees
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:48:13
I have a feeling most of the people who so vehemently talk down "bcash" (since when do the opponents of a movement decide a movement's name?) don't actually use Bitcoin at all. They just hold it forever because their end game is to turn their bitcoin into more USD than they bought it for.
Those who actually use bitcoin for **actual transactions** will quickly find that fees are exorbitantly high, prohibiting small transactions. I remember when Bitcoin was $1 and the vision was that it was going to dissolve power structures and allow your everyday person, even someone in a shitty 3rd world country, to engage in transactions without needing government approval. &lt;EDIT&gt; As one example, look at Venezuela. Rampant hyperinflation, capital controls, a government completely high on power...the ideal case for cryptocurrencies. Too bad buying BTC in small transactions will lead to getting murdered by fees. Oh well, at least us first-world bitcoin hodlers can fondle our magic numbers whose sha256 hashes have just the right amount of leading zeroes. &lt;/EDIT&gt;
Now it's a bunch of speculators speculating about what other speculators will do. Do the people on this subreddit (not to single anyone out, just using this one as an example) actually understand the technology beyond bitcoin? Because it seems to be that all anyone cares about is it being a store of value and not it being an actual useable technology to conduct transactions with.
Bitcoin wasn't created by core. Nor was it created by solely satoshi, even though they're undoubtedly the larger influence. What right do people have to claim that their particular bitcoin fork is the "true bitcoin" and everything else is an altcoin? Why is everybody so afraid to accept that there are multiple forks of bitcoin? The answer to me is really obvious - they don't actually believe in BTC / cryptocurrencies because of their understanding of the potential of the technology. Instead they are clutching their BTC, desperately afraid that their chosen coin will lose legitimacy if they accept that there exist other forks of a protocol that's supposed to be decentralized
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:09
Legacy code, except block size is increased. Having transaction fees be negligible is such a nice feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:02:24
That's my opinion as well. Of course debating the merits of btc vs bitcoin cash (bitcoin cash is far more usable due to the tx fees) has made me start to realize that Monero might be a better alternative. Smooth block emission, built-in privacy, etc are all very appealing
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:59:57
Companies are centralized. They rely on intellectual property, which only exists (currently) with a centralized government.
BTC is a decentralized movement, but you wouldn't know that browsing this subreddit, given that the decisions of what gets implemented in BTC are controlled by a handful of core devs. Thus your analogy doesn't make any sense to me.
Segwit as described was not in the original BTC whitepaper. I don't really care about segwit, I just want a malleable block size, so I don't care whether it's in there or not, but what right is there to claim that BTC is the "true bitcoin"? If Bitcoin cash ('bcash' if you really want to use this subreddit's made up name which just adds to the confusion) more closely resembles Satoshi's whitepaper, then how are you determining which one is real? By marketcap?
This silly bickering is exhausting. What happened to people understanding and caring about the technology behind decentralized systems? When did bitcoin become a bunch of rampant speculation and "to the moon" memery while transaction fees have skyrocketed? The whole situation (and the ***sorship, etc) have left a bad taste in my mouth.
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:33:30
Exactly. It's hilarious that people stock up on gold for a potential apocalypse because in that case, no one would want gold. Food, guns, ammo, etc are what would actually be valuable, so if you're preparing for the apocalypse you should invest in the supplies that you actually need.

@_date: 2016-05-24 20:29:58
Segwit aside, anyone who claims bitcoin is "supposed to be a cash system" isn't seeing the bigger picture. Personally, I think people are going to look back at statements like yours and laugh at how naive they were. (And by the way, transaction malleability is still a nifty feature to have.)
We act as if bitcoin invented the blockchain, and it sort of did, but the real truth of the matter is that bitcoin is a *specific use case* of the blockchain, which was the real innovation. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that the blockchain invented bitcoin (or rather, allowed its existence).
The power of the blockchain will extend far beyond merely allowing people to send payments. Even only allowing 40 arbitrary bytes to be embedded (via op_return) is a huge deal, because it allows proof of existence by storing hashes in the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:52:05
Yes, bitcoin was designed as an electronic cryptographic currency. But Bitcoin has no leader, not even Satoshi were he to actually sign a new message with his key. It's entirely built on consensus. The consensus on what it's best to use the bitcoin blockchain for will always be changing
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:49:45
I don't know how BTC can ever be used as a currency when the coin supply dries up. Deflationary currencies don't work as currencies because they discourage spending the money.

That literally makes no sense, which is why I'm baffled whenever I see "bitcoin purists" holding their currency through ups and downs (hint: most people just say that so they can make a profit when gullible people are still holding rapidly depreciating bitcoins).
Even if you believe in the future of bitcoin, if you think the price is going to go down (which is obvious with the current bubble), you should sell now and buy back in when the price drops. You'll end up with more bitcoins to make sweet, sweet love to.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:47:04
I'm not a bitcoin defender, but it's silly to use one week of a giant bubble as your example.
