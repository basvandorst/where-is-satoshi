Commit only as much as you're willing to lose, consider it as a ten year investment - and you won't need to care anymore.

It's not a CPU.

Not sure I agree with you there.
I got hacked off with Windows the other week and installed Ubuntu. Everything worked straight away. Spotify, Steam (despite running a 7850 rather than an nvidia card), Silverlight in Firefox, the free office seems to have leapt forward.. I found open source versions of all the server/storage/disk utilities I need for work. The only reason I've switched back to Windows (I have two SSDs, one Ubuntu one W8.1 and an early UEFI BIOS that allows this) is because the framerate in CS:GO is marginally better.. But frankly I can't see a non-gamer having a problem.

The way I look at it: I'm 6 months into a 10 year investment.

It's probably just dipping now because of financial world fuckery and it being Christmas - a bunch of people will have cashed in to pay for presents. I'm content to hodl. Seen bigger dips than this and, crucially, I can afford to lose the money I put in.

You'd think they'd at least get it proof-read before sending out such a potentially incendiary communication.

Either way we lose, but with Trump at least we don't have to hear her voice anymore. 1AFy6UUdpfsuZaUDLfEP478eH6rLBV5v2N

US: [Kraken]( [GDAX]( or ~~[Bitfinex](
UK: I use [bitbargain]( 
Intl: [Local bitcoins]( 
Its acceptable to use coinbase or indeed bitbargain to *buy* coins but then you must remove them to a wallet. Its best practice to do the same even with exchanges, unless you're planning to trade regularly on one of the three listed under US. [Electrum]( is the preferred choice on I personally use [Coinomi]( (but with the latter make sure you retain your key and put a strong password on your phone).
Edit: missed a parenthesis   
Edit 2: didn't realise bitfinex no longer served US, thanks @_date: 2017-11-29 21:22:49
ITT: A dozen people who ignored all the other posts ever about avoiding coinbase like the plague.

What's your point? Acura is Honda's American brand - they're built to the same standards as Civics and CRVs.

So, assuming this isn't complete tosh - does this mean enemies of Russia will try to devalue Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:41:12
I'm new to bitcoin but it seems weird to me. Like propaganda. I'm not freaking out (I've bought recently), i'm gonna hold on and see what happens since I've only invested what I can afford to lose, but I always get sketched out when too many people say the same thing.

YES. I'd given up my usual daily check of Preev last week due to all the short-termer negativity on here and just now checked my balance as Phil Collins blared from my speakers.. Hodlin FTW, here.

The 'Stock World' seems to make noob mistakes every 8 to 10 years, usually blaming it on poor people and immigrants.

Well if you will buy at the top.
The advice on this subreddit (from the non shills) has always been:
* Don't invest money you can't afford to lose
* Buy the dip
* Hodl (which beyond the memes means its an investment. Stick it in a paper wallet and leave it there for years.)

Bought last week at £3649. An hour ago it was selling at £3k. Now it's £2850. That's another 4% drop in an hour. I'll hold what I have but I'll be buying more if it drops to -25% (presently - 21%).
Edit: down to £2735 in 15 mins (25% down since last week)

Six months later PBoC releases something strikingly similar to Quorum and Jamie Dimon hails it as a masterstroke.

UK specific: Bitbargain is good
Everywhere: Localbitcoins

Just buy in smaller chunks and when you can afford to chuck some money at a potential loss. I bought 0.03 last week when it dipped and another 0.07 today. Since I bought the last chunk it's gone down another 3% - but I've only 'lost' £7 in the process. I doubt it'll fall more than 20% more but on my way there I'm set to buy another 0.2 in increments.

Six months later.. PBOC does something to benefit the dollar and JP Morgan gets a favour from the US Treasury.

In order to short anything you first need a market (people to bet against) for that short. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:28:21
Sure, but it has to happen first. You can't short against that which doesn't exist and you'd be unwise to set up a short without first understanding that market.

You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, blockchain-kabobs, blockchain creole, blockchain gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple blockchain, lemon blockchain, coconut blockchain, pepper blockchain, blockchain soup, blockchain stew, blockchain salad, blockchain and potatoes, blockchain burger, blockchain sandwich.
