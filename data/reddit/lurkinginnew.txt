Got in for the first time in Late-October 2013. All in. Was hurting extremely hard after Mt Gox, to the point where yes, I did need therapy, and yes, I had suicidal ideation.
I believed in the technology, and that every cent I put in, whether it made money or not, was charity to future generations if we are successful in bringing down the legacy banking system. This is what drove me crazy. We had a chance to beat the banks, and nobody was willing to chip in to support the price / reputation of Bitcoin.
From there I just did my weekly charity. I treated Bitcoin like a religion whose church you tithe every week. 5% of my disposable income every week, not caring if it was going to become $0.
Went all in again after Trump won, because I knew for a fact that a Hillary loss meant that Bitcoin had an infinitely higher chance of succeeding, due to her ties to bankers, and the history of the political establishment's over-reach and self-defense of The Swamp. Most vindicating move I've ever made in my life.

You are a moron. Obama's successors and their deep state associates would have killed Bitcoin in its crib. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. The fact that ANY crypto investor could have anything but hate and disdain for the administration that brought the most vengeance towards whistleblowers and journalists in history amazes me. People can be so visionary to see the future of tech like Bitcoin, but absolutely moronic in thinking that Killary and her cabal would do anything to allow us to disrupt their money-printing machines and snouts in the trough.

If there is $120,000,000 of fiat money flowing into BTC daily, then that means there are almost 14,000* held bitcoins being sold to new buyers.
*1800BTC mined per day = $14m per day. $120m - $14m = $106m. $106m / $7600/BTC = ~14,000BTC
So basically, the "smart money selling" is quite furious right now...
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:48:55
Valid - but I don't see a 30% candle (in the upwards direction) coming any time soon. Could happen to the downward side as we've seen a few times this year already.
The bear is here, and will be here until the halving at the earliest (May 2020), as it looks like we're repeating the 2014 bubble-pop pattern. If 2014 pattern holds, we will descend slowly down to somewhere between $3000 and $4000.
From there, McAfee will need to pray it jumps from $4,000 to $1,000,000 in a 6 month period, or he's eating his dick.
Happy to be wrong, but until it stops taking a PhD in Comp Sci to learn how to run a node (regular or lightning), there is no new money coming into this industry (except for the idiots like me who DCA weekly. Regardless, there are barely any of us who do it, so our effect on price is non-existent)

Overly simplified answer is "its value evaporated with market sentiment"
At $1000, a bitcoin represented $1000 of value to the market. At $700, a bitcoin represented $700. However, at ALL times, 1BTC = 1BTC
No winning or losing in BTC terms, only value created / destroyed by the whims of the market.

Any examples of development other than Lightning? Not being a dick, I'm just not very knowledgeable about stuff coming thru the features pipeline.
These are the things that have been floating around since I joined the ecosystem in the great Bubble of 2013:
- Lightning (and side-chains in general)
- Schnorr Signatures
- Smart Contracts (RSK or equivalent)
I have a bit of faith that lightning will be reasonably well stress tested by the end of the year, but unless the node count goes up by a factor of 10 i.e. around 20,000 nodes (and channel count by a factor of 100 i.e. around 650k channels), it won't be much of a network to write home about.
From how the network has been growing however, such node counts aren't THAT fanciful. I would run a node myself if I wasn't so technically incompetent / ignorant.
I have money though, and am desperate to throw it at someone who can build me a node that "just works" out of the box so that I can plug it in and contribute. Absolute madness that no-one has brought such a product to market. Just a simple little box that you plug into power &amp; LAN, and everything happens by itself.
To that end, all I can do to contribute to the ecosystem is buy weekly.

Words of advice young padawan:
1- i'd put aside a small weekly budget for continuous investment
2- i'd go to 
3- Have a look at the 1 day &amp; 3 day time formats
4- Put your orders in somewhere between the blue &amp; yellow lines
This isn't a shoot to the moon, but a good steady growth. You'll find the best value for your weekly savings here.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:08:54
Basically, the chart shows the movement in the price of Bitcoin over time in the form of time interval-based "Candles".
At the "1wk" view, one candle represents price movement over one week, whereas at the "1m" view, one candle represents a minute of price movement.
Bitcoin is a very long game, so you shouldn't really look at any patterns are 100% indicators of success, but based on how far away the price has gotten away from the blue and yellow lines should be when you think about putting your weekly BTC budget savings as orders at a price somewhere between the blue and yellow lines for a good value-for-money purchase. 
From my experience over the past 3 and a half years is that it always always always comes back to somewhere between the blue and yellow bands!

Not hyperbole at all. If you want hyperbole, hang out with me one day!
This is what I say to people when they ask me about Bitcoin: "Our survival as a species depends on reverting to a "finite" economy. Our planet and resources are finite - an infinite economy is a complete disconnect. Unless we can expand out to space, our economy, and hence, our species is doomed. The only currently available way to realistically achieve this is with Bitcoin."
A lot of people laugh, but the ones with IQ over 120 tend to go out and buy BTC the next day after reading the whitepaper. I tell people to not bother even making an account on an exchange until they've read, understood, and satisfied themselves with everything in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:14:46
Bitcoin simply isn't a good idea for 99% of the population.
Price dropped over $200 in the span of 5 minutes on BFX today. If some poor bastard went margin long at $1100+, they would have been destroyed and liquidated.
I don't recommend Bitcoin to anyone but millionaires, and even then, I recommend that they only buy 1 or 2.
EDIT: When I recommend BTC to non-millionaires, I tell them that they should have a maximum holding of 1% of their networth in BTC if they're happy to hold for 5-10 years, or, 0.1% of their networth if they just want to experiment.

I don't recommend it because it's a "get broke quick" scheme.
Money is lost 99% of the time, unless you're happy to hold for AAAAAGES.
Money is only ever made during these bursts, which only happen every 12-18 months.
Put it this way, we are STILL yet to hit the ATH set in November 2013.
That's 38 months between drinks and counting.
If it wasn't for me doubling, tripling, quadrupling, quintupling..................."infinity"upling down on Bitcoin since I went broke from it in November 2013, I wouldn't have made any profit AT ALL.
But because I'm a believer, you must do penance first (i.e. buy, lose 90%, attempt suicide, recover, buy weekly) before you can get to the promised land.

There are 1800 BTC mined per day.
All things equal, if no coins are bought and sold, and the market need only absorb newly mined coins, then $7,000 x 1800 = $12.6m of fiat needs to be injected daily to just maintain the price.
This equates to $88m new fiat every week, and $4.6bn/yr.
To extend this logic to a $20k bitcoin, you're looking at $36m/day, $252m/wk, or $13.1b/year
Let's be conservative and say that there are 100,000 people who religiously save in BTC by buying a little bit every week. For you to have your sustainable $20k/btc, you will need each of these 100,000 people to invest an average of $2,520 per week.
Again, the point of BTC is to destroy government and banking hegemony. People need to be buying weekly and holding, otherwise, the price has nowhere to go but down.
(EDIT: Despite there being 750k+ users on this subreddit, I'd say 740k of them have a net worth lower than the required weekly maintenance investment)

Dictionary definition:  
"an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."  
The monetary system is administered and controlled by the state. People like us who have jobs or employ others are forced, literally by gunpoint, to participate's in the state's money-printing racket  
I agree with you though, the state's money printers go into overdrive to bail out their cronies at our extent, hence the term "crony capitalism". But don't ever ever get it twisted that capitalism isn't and hasn't been, the best ever way forward.  
Shut the money printers off, and watch the world flourish.

Problem is, it works like start-up equity. If you have very little equity in BTC, there's no point working for free to try and increase your equity through making the platform better. You end up going on to make a shitcoin and try to get rich off that. It's all about getting rich - very few people in the ecosystem actually here to destroy the banking cartel and restore individual financial sovereignty to the human race. Simply about money - that's it.
Unless people shelve their greed and shitcoin delusions, and start developing for Bitcoin, things are going to move very, very slowly.

As a developer, this would be a potential multi-billion dollar startup if I just made an altcoin, and made sure to own a good chunk of the pre-mine.
That said, if the LN devs are holding 1000s of BTC, then their efforts within LN will reward them handsomely anyway.

There are 790k subs to this reddit. Going by the above numbers, every single one of us would need to chip in about $100/wk to keep the price where it is. At $20k/BTC, you're looking at $300/wk.

@_date: 2018-04-07 04:59:37
"All things equal" = static. It's basically just an assumption for illustrative purposes to show what the NET daily inflow of money is required to keep price constant.
Using the above example of a $7000 Bitcoin, if a billion dollars worth of BTC is sold on any given day, then one billion PLUS $12.6m of bitcoin needs to be bought on that day to maintain the price.
If NET money in is greater than $12.6m, then price goes up. If NET money is lower than $12.6m, then price goes down.

I can say I agree with you almost completely (except for the Keynesian thing :p)
Point is, "banking for the unbanked" is anathema to the modern political establishment. For better or worse, we need someone to come in and at least sweep at the legs of the establishment to buy us some more development time.
Fine, there may be taxes on Bitcoin now, but I'd rather be taxed than banned/jailed for using Bitcoin.
Even if Trump loses in 2020 (which, I don't think he will. Fake polls show him at over 50% approval now (i.e. the same gas-lit polls who had Hillary winning in the biggest landslide in history), so who knows how high his approval rating truly is) - lighting should be ready by 2020.
With lightning a huge possibility ahead of the election, and a halving guaranteed before it, Bitcoin will be all the much harder to kill (in the USA at least) should the establishment regain power.
As a non-US Citizen, I can happily say that, if the US falls, everyone else falls with it.
EDIT: "Throne sniffing" is the act of sniffing a warm throne that royalty has just sat on, basking in the sweet smell of royal ass. As urban dictionary eloquently puts it: "one who is excessively servile in a self-degrading way to anyone perceived to have power"

This is exactly what I mean.  
Are you going to help me get my 14BTC back? Or are you just going to talk down to me like everyone else a few months back?  
Seriously, I worship the mantra of Bitcoin, but fuck me if I've ever hung out with a worse group of people than bitcoiners.
