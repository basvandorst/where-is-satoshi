My order was cancelled as well, no response from support after numerous e-mails.

Same. Bought at 300$ like an idiot but it is what it is.

It's working again!

Man I know that feeling. Luckily I managed to get verified level 2 for isnta buys. Don't worry I'm sure there's gonna be more dips coming up.

Yep just figured it out! Thank you very much though.

I for one am actually glad people are panicking. Gives us long-termers more chances to buy

Personally I use Coinbase. You just have to link it up with your bank account and you're good to go. Only problem is that you have to wait a week for your coins at first, but after a month from your first purchase you can become a Verified Level 2 user and buy instantly. I'd buy a small amount on Coinbase to get the process rolling now and if you want to buy without waiting I'd use localbitcoins. Steps should be pretty simple to follow.

I don't have much to dump to begin with so I'm not too worried about that.

Very true I'm just happy to get any BTC's at all at this point.
