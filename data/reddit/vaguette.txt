sorry but I didnt whine, I just insulted a bunch of kids upvoting a stupid post, you are the one whining here over my comment. Of course I will call them stupid, kids and idiots, did you even read the OP? This is what makes this sub a fucking joke, no one takes bitcoin seriously because of kids like OP and the fact that a post like this is on top of the sub. You are mad because I pointed out the truth? Go ahead and cry me a river kid.

It works, you just have to adjust your system. We are changing things that we usually do in Forex to the Bitcoin market needs in order to trade succesfully. Technical analysis can be done for BTC just adjust the time frame enough , code a bot to test the system , etc.

I am a student i made the graph with the information my dean sent me. He told me the price would crash to $200 and gave me some hints (it was an excercise) , I failed wth this graphic and i know but that was the idea(the dean gave me now some better tools to make grapahics and corrected my lines and tunnels, i am 16 1st semester economy , we using btc as  an excercise to see how market and people behave during a fraud crisis like mtgox. He (my dean was right) and it is one of the top universities in this country in economy, so you are wrong again.  Dont hate, learn. cya buddy
PS: I also have a forex account we use in class($10.000 demo and $200-1000 real each student) and we do a contest the whole semester. whoever gets the most money(best performance %) at the end takes their profit and also gets a 5 (best score) in the class. you dont fail if you lose money if you pass the final exam. I am currently  profitable trades and nearly doubled my account´s balance. That puts me in 2nd place in my class rght now , 2 months untill semester ends, I would score 4.5 right now being 5 the best).  Isnt it cool? If you want the learning material i can summarize it for you to also learn friend!

He was right , you were wrong, check the price of BTC.
