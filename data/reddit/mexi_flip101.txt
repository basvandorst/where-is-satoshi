Aww...late to thread, but wanted to add my two cents. 
Sorry your son had to go through that. There is no constructive criticism on this essay.  Was there a rubric? Something along the lines of "purpose/ideas, structure/organization, and conventions"?
It is an informational/opinion expository writing assignment, so as long as he a) defines bitcoin, b) describes with evidence how bitcoin is a technological advancement, and c) explains how bitcoin impacts his future, and presents it all in a clear order without confusing grammar, spelling, or punctuation then he would get a pass in my book. He writes better than some of my high school students. 
Yes, I am a teacher, (forgive my internet sloppiness) and I don't always agree with my students on topics (oh God, the horribly researched anti-GMO argument essays) but there is always a rubric and if I don't know about the topic a student writes about I will research it myself so I can check their information and offer other resources/supports. However, I also have students submit a proposed topic first--which must be approved--to avoid stuff like this, so kids don't waste time writing about random junk (young earthers and conspiracy theorists, I'm looking at you) and can draft and rewrite before an actual weighted grade is assigned.
That said... pretty please don't go to your meeting and launch into the teacher like they are an enemy. Think potential ally and not adversary. Educate them about bitcoin, ask to keep communication lines open to clarify assignments when necessary. Your kid has to work with this teacher the rest of the year. I want my students to do well and be excited about what they learn. Hopefully this was just a bump in the road for your child and this teacher.
