First of all, I don't use either service personally, so there is no competition here. I am just trying to explain to you how downloading the source tree yourself (NOT a .zip file) is more than enough to verify you have a safe and checksum provable representation of the source code.
There are plenty of tutorials of how to do this online, but for the lazy:
# sudo apt-get install git (or yum install git, or install msysgit on windows)
# git clone 
# git clone 
Now you have access to literally every single commit change in the entire source tree for whatever tool you prefer to use.
This is the procedure I use when compiling my own bitcoin-qt as well. No one as paranoid as you seem to be should ever be running a client they didn't compile themselves.
~~Edit: Even more concerning, that PGP signed message you are talking about seems to be only their TEXT FILE version history. Not their HTML. Not their javascript code. Essentially nothing. It doesn't make their service ANY MORE SECURE because they pgp signed a random text file somewhere.~~
Edit: Found the bitaddress file name including the sha hash. As explained above, this whole step is unnecessary since the git history already includes hashes for every single source change.

There is no incentive to group together. As difficulty/hash rates drop, the hobbyist miners will have an easier time finding blocks. Being on a pool with more miners does not increase your total income.

If you download their git repository, every single commit hash can be verified by you in a number of different ways. The whole point of marking each commit with its own hash is that you can be sure the content you have is exactly what it was intended to be.

This is one of the major problems with cryptocurrency in general right now. Everyone keeps giving a shit what they are worth in USD.
The only way for bitcoin to REALLY work is to stop pegging its value against a fiat currency and to use it for as much day to day buying/selling as possible.
Businesses that complain about having their bank accounts shut down because they were selling bitcoins they received for USD are going about the whole idea incorrectly. If you want to run a bitcoin business, pay your employees in bitcoin, buy your raw materials in bitcoin, etc. No one MADE them cash out their bitcoins into USD, they just decided to keep their USD profits by selling the coins (helping to drive BTC/USD down as they did so.)
It really is more of chicken and egg type of problem. Not enough raw suppliers or other businesses take bitcoins yet for new businesses to operate in only bitcoin, but the new businesses need to exist before other new ones can use them as suppliers.

That is my whole point, it is EXACTLY like what they already do today. It is no different than the existing "security" that banks already say they provide.
The whole question was how remote accessed bitcoin accounts are more vulnerable than what is already happening today with fiat accounts:

Banks in the U.S. and elsewhere have a very similar fee structure. I agree that is it silly to charge people money when they don't have money, especially if the fee is more than their balance, but it really isn't that uncommon.
Unrelated: For some reason I only see things about how amazing Sweden is on reddit.

Most exchange addresses are well known. Also pool addresses can easily be identified on the blockchain from the scheduled payouts they do to thousands of users.
Coinbase holds much of their coin in cold storage and only pulls it out when purchase demand requires it. Many of the addresses like this have been identified and are even tagged on blockchain.info for easy tracking:

I think by in the know he means people who watch bitcoin news closely and have some good knowledge of how markets work. If a large enough number of investors decide to move on this news and sell large amounts of coin to try and bring the price down and re-buy lower, then the price WILL go down.
All of those investors together will cause the move they want even though none of them ever talked to each other about it.

They aren't changing the details of a transaction and leaving it valid, they are making a very similar transaction where for example the message that you can add changes by one character. If they get lucky and the wallet of the exchange grabs their fake one first (with the same outputs as the real one), the coins get transferred, but the tx the exchange created looks like it didn't occur (the exchanges in these cases are only looking for their own generated tx id, not the actual outputs being spent).

I would never, ever, go in person to transfer money from a savings to a checking account. I'm sure others would disagree, but I would much rather use bank level or better authentication completely online for the convenience. I haven't physically been to a bank in 3 years.

I doubt Newegg is misinformed. It would seem more likely that marketing people know that most searches and eye catching things related to mining are going to say bitcoin right now (on average now that the public at large is starting to hear about bitcoin a lot.)
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:30:29
How is it any more vulnerable than transferring my savings to my checking today? Given that the bank is "insuring" my accounts from theft.


How can they guarantee this any more than they guarantee my funds are safe from hackers today?


Then why is that not the only way to allow secure remote access with my fiat accounts today?

This is one of the major issues keeping bitcoin from really becoming a currency, things are always still priced in fiat.

There is no pgp signed document because that isn't how git commit hashes work. You can calculate the hashes entirely yourself if you are really that paranoid about it:
If you don't trust that a git commit hash is correct for the content contained in it, then you should throw away your android phones and all of your linux computers as the entire source tree for both technologies is stored, compiled from, and distributed through git.

2FA does not require a third party to manage, the number are an open standard, which is why you can use google authenticator for coinbase, btc-e, mt gox, etc.
They don't need a private key to verify the numbers either, they just need the public key that matches the private key you use to generate the number. Just because CURRENT implementations of it have the third party create the private key (which they shouldn't be storing anyway) doesn't mean that is the way is HAS to be done.
An offline wallet that generates the key pair for an OTP system could be scanned into your authenticator application and then the public key stored for verification on the wallet's side of things. All of this doesn't require any change to the bitcoin protocol, just to the wallet program being used.

The problem with your question is that Safest and Easiest don't go hand in hand when it comes to wallets.
The safest wallet is a paper wallet generated on a computer that is not connected to a network in any way running a clean bootable linux usb stick followed by literally melting the usb stick and the computer used to create the wallet.
This is obviously not the easiest wallet to create or use though...

You can always buy during the crash a few times to lower your break even point. Depends on your long term outlook. I plan on just holding the pile I already have, but given more expendable (ok to be lost) cash, I would probably buy more as it crashes just to get my final break even a few hundred lower.

Except that every single password generated there could be stored in a database and used later in a dictionary attack with ease. Not saying that it is, just that they could be. The whole point of this system is not to need trust though, and that sure as hell seems like you are trusting some website not to store what it gives you.

This is true in the US as well. Taxes are out of the gross amount your paycheck is worth. Once they are taken out you can do whatever you want with the money, it was already taxed.

Lucky, my 3.5 coin order was already down 30% before the coins I purchased on the 10th even hit my account on Monday. I was buying them specifically to pay for something immediately when the coins hit the account. By the time they got there, I could no longer buy the item in question... No refunds or cancellations for me, just a $1,500 hit.

Not necessarily. I can mail you cash. The third party can be contacted in whatever manner you choose, phone call, email, in person, whatever.

I'm assuming you put your private key down in the cave? Careful with this though. Even seeing a partial private in a QR code corner is enough to make cracking the address thousands of times easier. Granted thousands of times easier than a trillion trillion trillion trillion is still pretty hard...

Insider trading cannot exist in bitcoin. At least not the way it works today. If there are ever so many regulations on bitcoin as to make prosecuting insider trading with it a possibility, I will stop caring about bitcoin.

I got this on blockchain.info, coinbase.com, and bitcoin.it all at the same time. I am guessing they just all use the same host who just misconfigured something.

Even if all but a few miners pulled out of the system, there would still be a block found every 10 minutes. The "network" would run at basically the same speed because the difficulty would drop. The only way for the difficulty NOT to drop and for the system to break down is if everyone pulled out so fast that 2016 blocks were NEVER found EVER.

The bitcoin protocol actually supports this natively without a central third party. It can be any trusted third party (even an individual) and just a personal check from a buyer to a seller. Using Contracts in the transactions, a buyer could create a transaction that needs two signatures (the buyer and a third party OR the seller and the third party). Essentially the third party can be the trusted person to say "yes the money was paid these coins can move now". There are TONS of possibilities using the script protocol in transactions. Here's a probably better explanation with the technical aspects:

Virtual currency with the ability to be completely anonymous about? Tough to tax someone when you can't find out who has the coins or who they got them from. Granted that much anonymity takes a lot of effort, but people avoiding taxes seem to not mind the amount of effort involved.

From what I can tell the bank accounts and addresses are one and the same. Each bitcoin address in the bank would have a fiat amount and a bitcoin amount that could be exchanged for each other at will (using the bitcoin address associated with that account.) This way, the single account number (the bitcoin address) could be posted (as a hash) with the total in USD (or whatever) and BTC for all to see, while still remaining completely anonymous.
You may be right though, I may have just read something wrong in op's other comments.
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:01:08
It is easy enough to hash the bitcoin address and pull off the first 8 characters or so to create this anonymity. Many of the pools do this already.
