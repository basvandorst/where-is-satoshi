Has anyone established that they updated OpenSSL? It sounds a lot like it's just heart bleed being used to steal session keys
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:31:05
Apparently people with 2fa have had their coins stolen.
I think this problem has heart bleed all over it - possibly people stealing session keys since it seems related to people logging on

you can shoot your foot off in any language.  It's just very hard not to in PHP.  
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:25:15
.. Even were that true (it sounds like it's not) - that is still harder than necessary.  
Stealing a session key gives you a full, authenticated, session; 2fa or not.  Email complications are quite aside the point - an attacker just doesn't need any of that.

... I  read it a few times and I don't see why that required someone to get defensive at all
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:18:04
You're still missing the point entirely.  2fA is irrelevant if you can steal sessions, and individual transactions don't require 2fa verification (it seems they don't). 
2FA in this scenario ads **no** additional protection from a heartbeat style attack stealing session keys.
Do you understand yet?

Depends on the purpose.  In most cases it means you're trusting electrum an awful lot...

You're wrong about China.. That was why it dropped from $1000 - they got out of it after the law change

... I... I'm getting a little frustrated that people may not understand the hearbleed threat - people can steal session keys.  This is a trivial attack which is very powerful; when that kind of thing works why would people go after multi-step attacks involving email...
Stealing a session key allows an attacker to takeover your session, and do everything that permits.
This is very straightforward, and far easier than them trying to compromise your logon credentials **and** your gmail.... people are going off on this big 2fa / gmail bunch of tangents when that's not the lowest hanging fruit if this was a heartbleed issue.

Yeah.. I wouldn't use the same wording as you but that fact that people are strongly emotional about it like its a faith/religion only gives me *less* faith in the whole thing.  
Sound points like more activity etc I like, but posts verging on religious... urgh

There are two things going on here:
A: their procedures are glaringly broken &amp; need to be fixed - this deserves to be flagged
B: you *were* kinda being a dick; getting frustrated is fair, failing to see you were being a dick is not
Part B was not necessary

... I don't agree. In both our cases PayPal has just chosen the wrong judgement given the information available.  They need to consistently escrow correctly.  They don't.

Even as a buyer I got ripped off like this; bought a $200 item which just plain never showed up - filed complaint, seller posted 'tracking number' which only showed that 'something' not even the right weight went to my country... Could've been for any item that went anywhere in my country... It sure as hell didn't make it to me.  I had a background of stellar history.  Fuck you PayPal.

for you: 
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:22:46
It would seem you don't even have two reasons.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:26:53
this is called speculation.  You can do it in shares / currencies etc too.  It all works the same.  
Have a go at 'paper trading' - go to marketwatch.com and set yourself up a game (or any similar site that offers a paper-trading setup).  Make a second 'fake' player who just buys a shit-tonne of some kind of index shares, like say VTI - the VTI account shares you don't touch.  With your normal account - you try and beat that - VTI is your measure of what money would do if you didn't touch it &amp; bought a spread of shares., by buying shares on the lows and selling on the highs.  
Try and do it for six months as the others mentioned.  If you can do it successfully enough to think you should gamble your money, good luck.

Except that it might lead to prople getting the fake av malware, when they want to do a full scan and search for products.  
Its entirely common to get compromised without installing or running anything; a browser exploit only takes a visit to give rull control to an attacker.  Heck even the sites that jailbreak phones just require a visit (and often use drive-by appropriate exploits).  Ive seen a windows one before where the preview functionality explorer does on thumbnails in windows was used so u were infected as soon as you viewed a folder with the magic picture.

Silly legal person, 3 and 4 were both false dichotomies - you could have even pointed out that one part of the question being true doesn't mean the implied conclusion was.  
Your answers were good but didn't point out the questions were flawed; I would've liked to rub it in his face.

came here to make this comment, but upvoting his is the correct response.
I think C is actually the most important point; bitcoin enthusiasts are a long way from being apple's target market.. which is people that want devices that simply 'work' for fairly simple use-cases like facebooks, twits, sms's and the occasional candy crush.

Please dont give them ideas; the nigerians will use it for fraud and bitcoin exchanges will get blocked by the banks once they see it as something mostly used by the nigerians, similar to the popularity of western union with them.

Buying or not buying is not a very effective way to tell apple *why* you're not buying it.  For their part I'm sure apple would try to explain a dip in sales too, but would it get attributed to the right reason?  Who knows.
Him being an apple fanboy doesn't really change anything in a way I can see?  IPhones are in a lot of pockets - they're not insignificant.
