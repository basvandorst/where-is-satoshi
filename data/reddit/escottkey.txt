Correct. Further, bitcoin.com is a bitcoin cash website, and bitcoin.org is the real one.

Ok yeah sure, but that's kind of a different thing. 
The point is you're saying "well what's a beta", and diving off into unproductive semantics.
 The fact is all the devs regard it as a beta, that's how they describe it, that's how it functions, that's what it is. 
When will it be out of beta is a legit question and if you can't address it then you're not adding much to the conversation.

Who is the author of that book?

Then say goodbye to mass retail adoption.

How about when the main wallet devs stop warning you not to send more than you're willing to lose?

Not a good analogy I'm afraid. 
You're familiar with "tapping" debit cards?
How do you think it would have affected adoption if every time you did  that a message came up "this may permanently lose your funds, do you want to continue?"

It's difficult for an organisation without a central authority to give accurate predictions, but that is a disadvantage whether we like it or not.
 
People who have been in crypto for a long time really underestimate how alien and untrustworthy the sector still seems.
I guarantee you that the average person trusts coinbase or binance as much as they trust any random internet vendor ie. very very little. 
For true street level adoption you need people and institutions with public profile saying "yes, you can use this, this is legit." BTW I feel Elizabeth Stark is doing a good job in this area.

Oh my god what an idiot. Imagine losing a slam dunk case because you were too proud to accept pro bono representation.
