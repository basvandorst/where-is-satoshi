Read more into Mt Gox.  I'm saying one person single handedly inflated the price from a few dollars to over 100.  He did this BECAUSE he was hacked, but he basically was easily able to manipulate the market with a bot that continued to buy creating a sort of mania and run up.  Also it's really easy to manipulate one market, you don't need to manipulate CB, Binance, Kucoin, everything.  If you cause a mass hysteria on say CB from a fiat to BC perspective, everything else will drop with it.  You need to do research on market manipulation and read up how easy it is.
I  used to think all this "whale suppression sell wall" shit we see was all bull shit until I read up on it, see how easy it was and how feasible it is.  Rarely do people who want to cash out do so by sell walls, they just market sell as sells walls are very risky.

There are about 2000 wallets with over 1,000 BTC.  There are also multiple people with multiple wallets that have 100s of BTC.  Also I was being generous with my numbers.  Realistically you could sell 100 million worth of bitcoin and it could cause the crash it is now.  You have to remember probably at least 75% of BTC is frozen.  What I mean by that is it's being held off exchanges.  So it's not available for trading making the price irrelevant of it.  All you need to do is cause a 5% dip, followed by another few % dip, people get scared and start selling.  Or just throw up a huge sell wall, people look at the charts and get scared and boom the price starts tanking.  It's super easy to manipulate markets when you have a lot of money.
That's why it's frigin illegal usually.  If you don't believe it's possible for one dude to manipulate the whole market, just go look at Mt. Gox.  That was literally one kid who started with 50 grand back in the day.

This is a pretty common misconception.  Just because it's 200B, there's only probably 500 million worth circulating on some major exchanges.  In total I'd be surprised if there was even a billion worth of buy orders on all exchanges combined.  All that requires is a sell of a few hundred million to COMPLETELY tank the market.  You could sell 100 million total across a few exchanges and it would cause what's happening now.

I got a fucking push notification on my phone from CNN about this and the FUD is fucking REAL.  It made it sound like the SEC blocked trading of bitcoin in the US.  This is some bitcoin company that is a frigin penny stock.

If they were previously on the device and now they aren't showing anymore there should be no way they were hacked unless you transferred them.  Just follow the recovery guide

Question, can I move to a wallet even if I only own a portion of a bitcoin?  Do I need to own a whole bitcoin to move to a wallet and get the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:45
Your ledger wallet should have come with a recovery guide.  It's pretty easy to follow, typically I tell people when getting a nano s to put a tiny bit on it, erase everything and follow the guide to feel more comfortable.  It did come with a recovery sheet correct?

The idea is OP could have just used the 1000 in USD on the PC and he's even more ahead.
There are some real hurdles for BTC to be adopted.  I'm a big believer in a digital currency, but BTC has a long way to go and it needs to catch up fast because this next year I really believe will be the mass adoption curve or it'll be forgotten.  I think the concepts will stay but I think this is gonna sky rocket to 40-50k and if it's not ready it's going to crap out.  If it craps out, I think it'll give another currency with no transaction fees, faster transactions, etc a chance.

Always diversify, and I mean this in all investments.  There's multiple points to make though.
Diversify in bitcoin, it's always possible bitcoin ends up being blockbuster and some other alt-coin ends up as netflix.  It's also possible Bitcoin ends up being the primary currency in 20 years.
The idea of BTC though isn't to invest in bitcoin.  It's that Bitcoin is going to be the currency of the future and to turn your FIAT into another means of currency.
If you are just investing in Bitcoin my advice would be to diversify and consider your money gone if you don't believe in it as a future currency.  Then you're just betting and buying into some hype.  Which is fine but only invest as much as youre willing to lose.

It can take up to like 2 hours chill.  Lots and LOTS of transactions right now so it could take even longer.

If it ever reaches a million it would require world wide adoption and you really wouldn't be measuring the cost to USD.  This would basically require there for USD to barely be used anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:47:46
I'm confused, did you have money on your wallet before or did you just recently transfer money and it's not showing yet?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:14
I mean the idea is that you never cash out.  The idea is that you are just buying things with it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:05:07
Well ya, the idea is that this becomes a means of currency.  For that to happen it NEEDS to be less volatile.  I get paid in bi-weekly installments of USD because I don't worry I'll wake up tomorrow and it'll be worth 30% less than it is today.  It takes years for my salary to need to be adjusted due to COL adjustments.  The idea is that if Bitcoin is going to be used as a REAL currency then it needs to level out to a point where you aren't day trading BTC just like you aren't day trading USD (I know some do).  But then yes the real investments will be in start up coins that want to mark out a niche or compete against bitcoin.

How are you not getting this, his cost basis would be the same if he purchases 1000 of LTC in USD now and 200 of usd that he used on the machine.  OR he purchases 200 and has 1000 usd of LTC  and spends 1000 USD on the machine effectively 1200 either way.  The issue is he either spends another 20 dollars in fees, slower transacations, also no %rewards bonus from a CC or something or he just does it the way we are saying.

Ya use the recovery guide that should work.  It's always possible you were hacked but

The market cap at 1 million per coin is a little overzealous.  Unless that's also with the assumption that FIAT's value takes a nose dive and bitcoin is literally used as a global currency.
But your point still stands, if you believe in bitcoin, and that this is still in start up stages, it's not too late.  If it actually becomes a currency, then it's not really "investing" you're just choosing to use BTC over a euro or USD

Someone with more knowledge could do a better job at explaining this than I.  But a hard fork is basically a new technology or currency that wants to become a thing.  Basically one day you wake up and someone said hey everyone who has bitcoin, you all get examplecoin!  For every bitcoin you have, you get an examplecoin.  These usually start off being valued pretty low but they can either grow or some of them start off valued relatively high.
If you are on say coinbase, you have the right to your bitcoin but you do not own it.  You can claim it at any time, but if you do not claim it during a hardfork most likely you have no claim to the new currency since at the time you only have the right to the trading value of bitcoin you don't actually own the coin itself.

Question, I do not have a lot of money in BTC and would like to add more.  And I would like to make purchases through an exchange then hold the actual bitcoin.  What I don't understand is can I hold part of a bitcoin?  I have about 0.1 of a bitcoin right now and I want to hold it in a wallet or whatever so if a fork happens I get the equal amount in another currency.  How do I do this?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:44:35
I'm really new, but to my understanding there are different technologies that basically "copy" the transaction history of bitcoin, give all bitcoin owners an exact copy of bitcoin in a new currency and spin off from there.  So the exchanges basically are making millions of dollars holding these bitcoin, selling you the rights to ownership of bitcoin but when a hard fork happens they don't necessarily give you the equivalent in the new forked cash.  Some of these hard forks (say you have a full bitcoin) have been valued pretty high.
