Your trust in your owners is the only brazen thing. You need evidence that giving up fundamental freedoms is bad.

There are downsides to not looking both ways before you cross the street. Sometimes you get run over.

Just gave you a clear cut example of a manipulated statistic and disinfo.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:12:58
the downside of the aussie nanny state is the disinfo. 
Its as if they tell you cars never hit people because it's illegal. 
Then they censor or use disinformation to reduce stats or instances that go against their narrative. 
This is done for guns and crime stats there.
The problem is absolutely the nanny state, which makes people vulnerable so they can be more easily managed. It's not just for when the state fails, but everyday.

Big steaming pile of java...

Looks like I violated your safe space. 
You can report me to nanny if it makes you feel better.

Have a look at aussie crime stats vs "gun crime"crime or "gun deaths" you can easily see how the narrative of the greens is deliberately misleading. You can see many such examples if you try. 
If you want me to yield you can offer proof that your lack of human rights is superior to having them.

It's a currency, and you can move more of it for less cost than any other. Currencies settle debts. Your word game attacks are lame.

Your examples are precisely fractional reserve, which yes has a failure case with deflation. I was asking you to imagine the effects of deflation without fraction reserve, something not possible since the Era of coin and hacksilver.

It's easy enough to set already. But setting to anything else would be phenomenally dumb. What a pointless request.

What exactly do you think the difference is between a paper wallet and a seed phrase ? Generally speaking, the seed words are strictly superior in every way. 
That said, it really depends what you are doing.

Qubes is not suitable for running services, it's only barely stable enough to be a desktop.
@_date: 2016-03-16 10:40:50
Half the firewall scripts don't work. Qubes manager locks up randomly. Recovery from network outage requires manual intervention. 
In the end a dedicated machine for routing separate from app server was needed. Qubes is not ready

Outside of Keynesian fractional reserve, inflation and deflation are both natural and serve o stabilize the market. Deflation works in your favor when you are not in debt, and it is more natural to have nearly all of society taking on massive debts via their government.

Those who use it have an advantage over those who dont, so the spread of it is self motivated.

So if you are mass producing bip38 paper wallets are you giving them each a unique password ? 
If not its no better than not having a password at all. If yes, then bip39 is simpler, because the password is everything.

You dollar is worth X Satoshi at 9:00, then at 9:01 it's worth x + +/-1 . I mean how do you deal with that? The Satoshi in your trezor, your electrum, it's all stable and secure.

Trust the experts or use your brain to figure out why they are right on your own. If we increase the limit before the prerequisite changes then it becomes radically easier to dos and spam the blockchain. This was all spelled out so clearly, I don't understand how there are people who do don't get it but still have a strong stance on the wrong option.

More to do with the increasing cost to run one imo

Yes, guns would have saved so many lives in France . Automatic weapons are only superpowerfull in the movies. It seems like gun concentrators like you are largely ignorant about them

In this case the sender set a low free, plain and simple.

Would you also face 5 at once with no gun ? How about one mental person with a gun, would you still not want one ?

Noone chooses the number and timing of criminals to assail them. But you can choose to give yourself an option of not being a victim.

Users of a decentralized market really ought to block Javascript in their browsers. That makes react a bad choice. Why not go with server rendered pages.

Vote with your wallet, but don't tread on my rights.

Patently untrue, if you read history. The pregun eras were more brutal

Once you correct for the fact that the UK counts only conviction, it's obvious you are living in a false bubble of security. I've lived in the UK for a awhile, and nearly everyone is affected by crime, burglary, daylight theft, assault. Brits don't leave valuables visible in their cars because their windows will be smashed. 
You live in Satan's arsehole and are convinced it smells of roses. The us is safer, because that random old lady on the street may have 2 pounds of stainless steel justice on her hip.

Ammo is legal in switzerland. Parts of the US are as bad as Australia as far as gun rights go. Those are the parts with high murder rates.

I'm thinking more like per peer up/down caps, max in coming separate from outgoing, real bps rate control, etc. 
It's becoming quite expensive to keep my node going, especially cpu and memory are getting heavier.

Not if you are in the UK or straya, you are less safe than most of the us. Also, if you are in japan, you are perilously less safe, albeit from yourself.
