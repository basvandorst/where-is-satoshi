I see no reason to be partly decentralized, far more effecient to be fully centralized. Key reason for decentralization is immutability, eth dont want that so why pretend cause it is very costly. Something something Evil Corp. Blerk no limit on number of coins, blerk, premine. Oh yea smart contracts, thats what is missing from my life, lols
@_date: 2016-10-13 10:38:38
Can you define the "mining centralisation problem" ? 
The only crypto competition I see is for trading volume on exchanges.  I recently purchased clothes from Monero Apparel dot com and the only option for payment is bitcoin. No matter what I think about capacity the only option is bitcoin. I bet that is also true for most gambling and darknet sites.

Where is the value, how is nothing worth 95m
@_date: 2016-10-13 07:10:19
10x capacity perhaps, would that then increase required storage also x 10? Would that affect centralisation?
If more value per block is the goal then surely a 60min blocktime would be better cause people who really want a transaction to go thru will pay big fees?  or just reduce block size for same effect. 
Good thing is, it does work, as it is. Praise blockchain jesus!

So you mean 4 mining pools have 50%? Which is not really a problem is it ? They all are comprised of heaps of individual miners that can leave or swap pools at will. 
As for the 70% in China I understand they have access to cheap power so it makes sense. The chances of the gov actually attacking the chain seems very remote. To be successful they would have to take over all the miners at same time just to censor some transactions?

@_date: 2016-10-14 06:38:27
You may very well be right I don't claim to know the answer. 
I am yet to see one successfull use case outside of bitcoin. None of this blockchain shit does anything outside of pump n dump. Bitcoin is a 1 in 100 year super invention. Bitcoin is the big invention and every man and dog wants to cash in. Blockchains are generally speaking dumb cause they are so inefficient. Proof of work is wasteful and a terrible idea unless it is needed. To use it for things that can be done without it is just plain stupid. The one use case is e money outside of gov control. It needs to be stored forever on an increasingly large number of computers, theres not to many companys that need that so much that they will pay the costs. The cost to store something forever on a massive number of computers - why would you do that. The more that try dump shit on the blockchain the more it will cost for us to use it. 
4txs seems to have worked pretty well for 7 years, so not sure why you say that would be death of btc. I can see it may slow the growth if it doesnt change but I am not sure that is bad. As for network advantage, it is only relevant where there is a competitor offering similar. There is none. Btc was created for free by donated time, it was created fair for everyone and open so anyone can inspect it. Where is the competitor? What even comes close to this? 
Almost got emotional there!  But truely what is even close to btc. If btc dies why would you trust any other crypto. The world is struggling to understand and accept btc. If it fails the world will take 20 years before they trust anything like it again. 
Happy to be convinced otherwise, I have an open mind. Can you give me any use cases that NEED a blockchain? Anything
@_date: 2016-10-04 02:02:28
Blockchains are war. This is enemy propaganda. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 02:51:47
If any pool or miner gets and sustains 50% bitcoin is dead. So any logical actor has the economic incentive to not let this happen. It makes no sense to remain in a pool that gets too close to 50% cause you might get heaps of blocks but the coin will be worth 0 so there is no value there. 
I do not see that bitcoin competes with other blockchains. Do you mean eth? Cause that is just not even in the ball park, they already destroyed censorship resistance not to mention the economics of unlimited supply and massive premine. Where can u buy anything of value with an alt coin?
Smaller than reasonable?? What does that mean? Smaller seems to be more secure. 
I dont mind if it does 4 tx second or 400000. I dont need the whole world to use it to make me happy or rich. Be nice, Id love to see a $5000 coin but thats just cause I want free money. 
Why do you want to double block size?? For more tx so more people use it so price goes up so Free money?
@_date: 2016-10-12 02:58:50
Thanks I had not watched that part. The slide at 2:34:45 from that youtube clip posted seems to make clear that 
faster blocks = less security
larger blocks = less security
My conclusion... less security = less security
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:16:10
I did see that. Seems to be a judgment on there behalf, as in it will have an effect but they judge that effect not to be a threat. I certainly dont have the answer but seems that less work would go into each block and therefore it is less secure. Which is true also for size I think, the larger the block the less work per transaction and so again less secure?

I agree the internet is certainly useful even though it is very centralized, I am not sure it is a worthy comparison. I disagree where you say "other people do" I assume you are refering to the usefulness of smart contracts. Please can you give an example of any smart contract that anybody has used or finds useful? I see no point in every ethereum node running the same computation to ensure immutability when a) this is trivually overturned at will of community b) there is only reason for smart contracts if there is a base layer of value. Given the unlimited supply and premine how can anyone take that base layer seriously
@_date: 2016-10-09 13:53:26
The DAO - people thought it "may" be useful, turns out it was for hacker and etc, as for augur, I understand that it can be done on bitcoin. That said I dont think augur is useable now other than for token pumping so still no smart contracts to be seen. 
Yes one company doing it, why not? Because they may censor stuff right? So the point of all this blockchaining is to not be censored. Only really worth the effort if you are at risk of being censored in the first place ie gambling inside the USA. or some such activity that is illegal or needing to be outside goverment control. 
I am fine with it regarding bitcoin because limited supply and it was fair. Everybody had a chance to be there, there was no real discrimination.  I am not so sure enough people even think about ethereums premine or unlimited supply. I suspect people are into ethereum for the chance to make money, i am not judging that, but it doesnt in anyway give me confidence in the tech. I hope I am wrong cause how the f can there be 1 billion invested in a pump and dump? I just cant see it, where is the use case, the actual real life use case. I can send you bitcoin, that has meaning and real value. The only thing I can do with ether is exactly the same thing (but far worse cause unlimited, premined bla bla bla)
