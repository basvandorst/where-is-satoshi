ETC is eating ETH-F's lunch. It is not a competitor to Bitcoin in any way, just like Ethereum itself was never a competitor to Bitcoin, even though dumb and gullible suckers treated it as such.
Longing ETC is probably a good idea right now, **for the short term**. In no way is it a realistic long-term platform. Vitalik himself has said that PoS (Casper) is doomed if The Attacker is allowed to keep his funds (as he is on ETC), and ETC has no development team other than the Ethereum Foundation who are moving forward with PoS and Casper.
It is abundantly clear that Ethereum is fucked. In the meantime, money can be made by shorting ETH-F and later on the same will be true for ETC.

Very true. Mid-2013, most of us were warning newcomers away from Gox already. 
I remember people constantly showing up and asking about how the Gox price was higher than other exchanges and how they could arbitrage, though most of them didn't know the term for it. Many of us consistently and repeatedly explained that the problem was getting fiat out of Gox and warned them not to risk sending any funds there.

You don't seem to understand scale. That's ok, I can help.
I can create a coin right now, and sell one for $1. Ok, now that's how much thieflarcoin is worth.
Then I convince a friend of mine to buy another for $10. It takes some convincing, but I manage. Ooh, awesome, my coin just grew 900% in value! It jumped up a whole order of magnitude (as did its "market cap")! Wowee! To the moon!
But convincing another friend to buy a coin from me for $100 is a *lot* harder. Actually, almost impossible, unless I'm a really, really good salesman. Especially if that friend of mine who bought for $1 is able to trade *his* coin. As soon as he hears that I'm trying to sell my coins for $100 each, he's going to be like "Yo man, I'll sell mine for $20! It only cost me a buck!" I'm going to have a real hard time getting that $100 per coin when I have to fight against his sell orders, not to mention that *other* friend who got his for $10.
...and trying to convince someone to buy my coins for $1000 each? Yeah, right. 
The same principle can make it look like a shitcoin has "better momentum" than the real deal, but be careful not to fall for it! That would be very naive. It's much easier to pump tiny, illiquid markets than it is to pump large ones with more liquidity. In the end, though, if those little illiquid markets are focused around commodities that don't have any real value or utility (see: every single altcoin) then in the long term (years or decades) they are going to trend towards a value of 0. That's because no one is going to want to keep holding them and hoping for the moon as it becomes clear that the coin doesn't have any realistic purpose or economic utility, and everything that it can do can be better done on the real Blockchain.
In the meantime, though, you can definitely get lucky and catch a few nice waves as the pumps and dumps cycle through. 
If you have any questions left over, let me know! I'm happy to help. :)

That's for the market to decide, obviously.


It's not, and I've never once seen someone claim that it is. Many think that ideally the blocksize would be *lower* than 1MB. What we have as the status quo is a de facto compromise, and SegWit is (relatively safely) increasing this to an effective 3.6MB cap. 
Why is *this* going to be the new "magic cutoff point"? Well, the engineers who understand the system have pretty much unanimously agreed that it is a safe change to make. In other words, consensus has been reached among the developers. 
Of course, Hearn and Ver and co. have done their best to stir up drama and make it seem like progress *isn't* being made. But drama is always being stirred up, and the riffraff are always being loud idiots; part of life is learning how to tune out the noise so you can make out the signal.

Both money and internet protocols are extremely sensitive to the Network Effect. In a nutshell, the Network Effect is basically "networks are more valuable and attractive when more people use them". It's why the Internet is more interesting than a LAN inside a private company, and why it's very hard to dethrone big sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit, even though it's easy to clone the code and run it somewhere else. 
Now, Bitcoin is obviously, by far, the biggest network in the cryptocurrency space. The vast majority of capital and talent is working on improving Bitcoin. So the Network Effect will make Bitcoin very, very hard to dethrone in this space. 
The final key piece is **sidechains**. With sidechains, Bitcoin will be able to do **everything** that any altcoin can do. That means that there can (and will) be a Turing-complete sidechain that can do everything Ethereum can do, and there will be a privacy-focused sidechain that can do everything Monero can do (even better than Monero can!). If you can do everything with Bitcoin that you could do with an altcoin, and more people use Bitcoin than the altcoins, there is zero reason for anyone to want to use altcoins versus Bitcoin sidechains.
To date, no one has been able to come up with an argument why using an altcoin would be preferable to using a sidechain that does what the altcoin does, but we have come up with *plenty* of arguments for why using a sidechain would be preferable to using an altcoin. If you think critically about this, then, it should be obvious that over the long term, as the market comes to terms with these facts and the technology is perfected, altcoins will die out and sidechains will flourish.
This perspective is known as "Bitcoin maximalism". No one has been able to offer a real refutation against it, so some people like to pretend that it is a ridiculous concept so that they can justify their altcoin investment(s) (you can see a lot of that in this thread, in fact).
TL;DR: Bitcoin has a network effect, which means that sidechains will be superior to altcoins, so in the long-term altcoins will die out as sidechains replace them, leaving one universal (yet flexible) money protocol.

Gregory Maxwell has been alarmingly consistent for over a decade now. He continually champions freedom, from what I can see, and is absolutely jaw-droppingly intelligent. This is just one of many example quotes from him that showcases his perspective and, at least in my book, grants him great esteem.
I am extremely grateful to have him fighting for the furtherance of Bitcoin, as he seems to do every day. 
I sincerely thank you for everything that you do and contribute, not just to Bitcoin, but to the world. I realize this sounds over-the-top, but you are one of the very few people who I feel deserves the praise.

The point is that the theft can't be covered up, because we can see that it occurred by reviewing the Blockchain. That point was just proven, making you look very stupid in this comment chain. 
Now you're trying to change the subject: "Oh well *obviously* we can see that the coins were stolen by looking at the Blockchain, but what good does that do when we can't retrieve those coins from the thief?" The point was not about retrievability, the point was about detectability of the hack itself, which the transparent Blockchain enables.
So, in closing, you just made a fool of yourself and now you're squirming.

Yes, you should absolutely reduce your exposure. I'm surprised Mt. Gox wasn't enough to get the message across, but this Bitfinex episode did it. In any case, good job, you have now seen firsthand what the risks of having money on an exchange are.

Not at all. The rate of inflation was about **double** most first-world national fiats' inflation rates 2 months ago. Now it is **lower** than those alternative monies' rates. Not *much* lower, but marginally so.
After one more halving, it will be significantly lower (less than half the rate of inflation of most national currencies).

This is untrue. There have been dozens of red flags with Bitfinex over the past few years. It is well known how terrible their security and codebase is, and they have a history of technical issues that are inexcusable. Their order-matching engine was executing trades in the $170s and $180s with thousands and thousands of buy orders in the $200s sitting there, in late 2015. I logged in to my account one day (which should have had 0 coins in it) and found 2 coins sitting there. *Someone else's* 2 coins. I didn't withdraw them because I am not interested in stealing coins that don't belong to me, but I sure logged on Reddit to see if I was the only one who this had happened to. Dozens of others were reporting similar things.
That was the day it became obvious to me to never send them any crypto, but it wasn't the first warning sign, not by a long shot.
I'm sorry for your loss, but don't try to pretend Bitfinex didn't have a long history of fuckups. They did.
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:15:05
Yes, they can. You're parroting a common misconception which proves you do not understand sidechains, which is why I recommended reading the whitepaper. 
Right now, you are uninformed. I recommend informing yourself. Firsthand research is the best way to do this.
In short, though, sidechains can do *anything* any altcoin can, *including* an entirely separate security model from Bitcoin's proof of work. In no way is a sidechain dependent on Bitcoin's main-chain or the security assumptions thereof. The only difference between a sidechain and an independent altcoin is the friction of conversion to and from Bitcoin.
In every single respect, a Bitcoin sidechain is equal or superior to an otherwise-equivalent altcoin, assuming that Bitcoin is the coin with the largest network. 
Seriously. Read the paper. Don't cut corners or you'll end up sounding silly by trying to talk about stuff you don't quite really understand.

I'm very much looking forward to efficient prediction markets, but in this case, sidechains are the future. Any innovation that can be implemented as an alt or a fork could be done as a sidechain, which is an objectively superior mechanism for these sorts of things.

The comment.
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:56:40


What an ironic way to start one of the most idiotic comments I've had the misfortune of reading.


*Should* be, sure, but that's a fantasy. The reality is that exchanges represent counterparty risk. With a digital bearer asset *that was designed specifically to eliminate counterparty risk*, when you give up sole control of the asset, *you have accepted counterparty risk*. Mt. Gox taught this lesson to the market in an unforgettable way. Either you don't know of Mt. Gox, in which case you haven't done your research and your opinion is moot, or you *do* know what happened, and you don't understand how this works, so your opinion is moot. Either way, you're a dumbass.


Oh, you mean to say that there are differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional, insured fiat? *You don't say!* 
That's kind of the idea here: Bitcoin typically isn't insured like dollars are. That's the "risk" part of the "risk/reward" equation. If you don't know what I'm talking about, which is looking rather likely, that's yet another reason to discard your opinion on these matters.


Sounds like you don't understand much of the real world. It does not matter what your liabilities are denominated in; creditors are creditors and none are allowed (much less *deserve*) preferential treatment.
This paragraph makes it abundantly clear that you are as ignorant of the law as you are of crypto. 


Yes, obviously. Creditors are creditors. The law is unambiguous on this matter.


Yes; if liabilities exceed assets, the company is insolvent, and all assets are liquidated in the process of paying back creditors as much as possible. Clearly you thought the answer to this question would be "No" which is pretty amusing. 


There's not much value to the perspective of the clueless.

I'm *really* tired of the Monero shills harping about that stupid rich-list page as if it's a good argument. This is coming from someone who just profited off the rally in Monero over the past 48 hours, too. 
Unlike the shitcoiners who are parading around this thread, though, I realize that over the long term, XMR will trend towards a value of 0 BTC per token. Especially because **objectively superior** technology is already in the works. One single person in was able to fathom the implications of tech like Mimblewimble and sidechains, while the rest of the community flailed around and made utter fools of themselves trying to scramble together an argument for how Monero could possibly be construed as superior (in *any* regard) to a Mimblewimble-esque sidechain. Even the core developers couldn't think of anything. All in all, the single best argument the community was able to eke out was: "Bitcoin is cancer." Not even joking.

You don't appear to understand what shorting is. To short, you have to borrow bitcoins and sell them. Later, you buy them back (hopefully at a lower price). 
So if you're holding 10000BTC, and you want to do the strategy you just described, you borrow 10000 BTC and sell them immediately (short). The price, of course, drops significantly from this large sell order. Now you sell your original 10000 BTC, at a much lower price than you would have originally been able to, and make much less money. Now you have to buy back that 10000 BTC you borrowed (cover your short), and fortunately the price is much lower so you have profited off your short. However, notice that you sold all your original 10000 coins for much less than you could otherwise have done. Beyond the slippage costs, you also had to pay lending fees for the short, and fees on every trade in this process.
In practice, you're going to lose money trying to short while you're also in a long position. It doesn't make sense, unless you are confident that you can recoup the slippage and fee costs by triggering a cascade through your actions, thereby allowing a profitable-enough short to compensate for the losses you suffered on your long.
Typically it's smarter to just sell your coins first and then enter a short if you think the price will continue downwards.

Fortunately nobody is saying Lightning is a panacae for Bitcoin scaling either.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:37:19
You can go look at Bitcoin Classic's Github, which tried exactly that. You'll notice that the changes made are actually *much, much,* **much** larger than a single line of code being changed, because there are other aspects of the code that will break if you don't make changes to accommodate for the new limit.
Basically, it's not as simple as it sounds. If you go change one line of code (MAX_BLOCKSIZE = 4000000), and do nothing else, a lot of things will go wrong, and I will be able to very easily "break" your chain. It would collapse.
So, basically, to really understand what the risks and issues are, you need to be able to understand the code itself. In other words, a software engineer will be able to "see" the problem pretty easily, but someone who doesn't write code or understand it would have a much harder time figuring out all the implications.
It turns out that pretty much **everyone** who understands code or Bitcoin in a technical sense **agrees** that the "simple up the blocksize" solution is a terrible idea, and all the other changes that are needed to keep everything from breaking if you do that are too ugly and brutish and ultimately pointless because it's not actually a real solution. Seriously, all the developers who know what they're talking about are in agreement. Consensus was reached a while ago. But some users who don't really understand the code are still upset (*because* they don't understand the code) so they keep demanding the "simple" fix (which actually turns out to be not-simple-at-all when you actually implement it) which the developers aren't going to waste their time coding because they understand that it's a bad idea.
That's why attempted forks like Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic don't end up winning: all the smart people and engineers can see what a bad idea it is and how poorly it is executed, so they reject the fork and continue on with Bitcoin as-is, which is being improved in *actual* ways for long-term scaling.
TL;DR: while it might *sound* simpler to a non-engineer, the "dumb blocksize increase" solution is actually just as complicated of an implementation as other proposed solutions which *actually* help long-term. Everyone who understands Bitcoin on a low level agrees that the real solutions are better, so we haven't forked.

No, that is not the definition of "two way pegged sidechain", that is more restrictive. It is, in fact, what I'm generally referring to when I speak of the Altcoin Apocalypse, though. It doesn't exist yet. But a two-way pegged sidechain does; it is indeed federated. That doesn't make it not two-way, nor unpegged, nor does it make it "not a sidechain". Just trying to be precise here, and when americanpegasus says "sidechains don't exist" it is demonstrably false.

@_date: 2016-08-14 16:09:42
Are you serious?
If Bitcoin were free forever, it would die when the block reward dropped to 0, because there would be no incentive to mine it anymore.
Speculators realizing this unsustainability would cash out ahead of time, well before the block reward diminished to 0. In fact, it would be in everyone's best interest to exit ahead of the others, so (depending on how efficient the market is) we would expect to see the price go to $0 in the near future, rather than in a century.
Bitcoin does not work if it is free. If you don't understand that, you need to do some research and put some thought into the matter.

This is grossly, grossly disingenuous. I can provide you with a dozen quotes of your long-standing community members (americanpegasus and crazyflashpie are two that leap to mind, but plenty others are out there perpetrating the same shit) out there shilling this shitcoin. Your silly little "don't buy Monero *wink-wink-nudge-nudge*" link is a joke, and I think you know it. Saying "the vast majority of our community actively discourages people from buying Monero" is such a flat-out falsehood that I am embarrassed for you, for thinking it would fly. Quit pretending your shitcoin is special and that the community isn't greedy. That wasn't true of the Dogecoin community, it wasn't true of the Litecoin community, it wasn't true of the Ethereum community, it isn't true of the Bitcoin community, it isn't true of the Monero community, it isn't true of any communities anywhere. Everyone is greedy, and **it is a fact that Monero is constantly shilled, especially in and Maybe you silently disapprove of the shilling, but it is ubiquitous and undeniable. These days, it is second only to Ethereum in terms of sad shilling.
So, no. Cut that bullshit out. Don't pretend away reality because you can't address my arguments head on and you're mad about that.
**You** haven't actively pumped Monero like a sad little shill, as far as I've seen. But you are not "the vast majority of the Monero community".


I have had probably 5 or 6 conversations with him in which I conclusively demonstrated the **lack** of such long-term viability to him. In every case, without fail, he has responded with something like "Oh I didn't know that, I'll read up more about that, I always like to learn something new" or simply stopped responding. This didn't happen once and then we went on our merry ways, this is a recurring thing. He shows up in tries to shill Monero, I break down his fallacious arguments, he either admits defeat or punts for another day, and then a day later he makes another shill post *including the same fallacies* as if we had never conversed in the first place. He is, at this point, remaining wilfully and deliberately ignorant.


Perhaps you didn't notice, but in this thread, I've pretty clearly explained why Monero stands no chance of long-term survival. So far, none of my points have been addressed. **None.** The best arguments I've been met with are "I don't understand sidechains" and "Bitcoin is literally cancer". 
*That* is what this community boils down to. "Bitcoin is cancer." Tell me again how you guys are going to succeed in the long term.


Oh no, did me pointing out that Monero is a shitcoin insult someone who was working on that shitcoin? Great argument there! I guess I was wrong all along, if I insulted any idiots along the way! /s


You can't be serious. "Bitcoin is literally cancer, and Monero is literally the Messiah!" 
I'm not here to hear ridiculous hyperbole and silly pie-in-the-sky rhetoric about how "Monero is *more* than a shitcoin!" Frankly, the Ethereum shills are better at that game than you are, anyway. I am here to raise *specific* questions about the long-term viability of Monero in the face of superior innovations like Mimblewimble, and to see if the community is capable of fathoming and/or addressing my arguments in that regard. So far, the answer has been a resounding **no**.
So, that brings us to the point: **I am here to discuss Mimblewimble and its implications for Monero and other shitcoins**. You are trying to change the subject by appealing to emotion ("you're being mean!") rather than discussing the subject at hand, likely because you realize that you are outmatched here and that I am right. If you could address my points directly, you would. The fact that you're instead desperately trying to change the subject speaks **volumes**.
I was waiting for your reply, because I figured you were the only one here who stood a chance of understanding the tech and implications on the same level that I do. Finally I got your reply, and it is conspicuously devoid of any substance. Your comment wasn't a rebuttal, it was an attempt at a distraction.

...and not a single one of those is both realistic and fatal. 
For example, if quantum computing is able to break SHA-256, the proof of work function can be modified. It will not be trivial and it will be a heated debate, but this would not kill Bitcoin. If ECDSA is compromised, there are other signature schemes that can fill its role.
If an altcoin someday hits upon a superior approach, we can sidechain it and migrate over to the sidechain, preserving ledger balances and thus the core of Bitcoin.
If a malicious state actor decides to 51% attack, we can blacklist them (or change our PoW).
Likewise, pretty much any doomsday scenario has a fallout bunker from which we can resume our global takeover.
Betting against Bitcoin is basically betting against humanity's ingenuity or self-interest. Mock that statement all you want, but it's the reality.
Bitcoin maximalism is the logical conclusion of well-informed critical thought on the subject.

You should read the sidechains whitepaper. It will likely be eye-opening for you.
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:19:40
Sidechain. It seems to have been designed, from conception, for that role. 
Highly recommend reading the paper. It's fascinating stuff. Literally superior to Monero in every way, most notably scalability and in the respect that no tail emission is needed. All this, with no privacy tradeoffs whatsoever.
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:20:36
Yes, indeed. It is probably the best whitepaper since Satoshi's, at least in my opinion. Very readable, very cogent, very prescient.

Ohhh this is delightful, I love it when shitcoiners get all stirred up.
Hey, you either understand sidechains, and what they represent over the long term, or you don't. You fall in the latter category.
Money can, of course, be made in penny stocks. You can get on the right side of pump and dumps if you're paying attention and get a bit lucky. I myself have profited considerably off of altcoin trading (does it magnify your rage to hear that and realize that your assumptions were wrong?). I'm just not stupid enough to think that shitcoins stand any long term chance of survival. This is because I understand the tech and economics here, darling.
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:32:47
A new type of OP code would need to be enabled in Bitcoin before a purely-cryptographic (trustless) sidechain can work. There's no hard deadline on that OP code set yet, but if I'm not mistaken, having SegWit enabled is basically a prerequisite for it, so we've essentially been waiting on SegWit. Since that's finally being enabled now, it shouldn't take *too* much longer for sidechain-enabling OP codes to materialize, but no firm dates exist yet. I would personally expect it to roll out sometime in 2017, but that's mostly a guess.
Before that happens, sidechains are still possible, but you have to rely on a "federated" peg, which means that certain people or organizations are in charge of it, facilitating the transfers between normal bitcoins and sidechain coins. It's not as good of a solution, but it's useful in some cases and good for experimentation.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:07:05
Strange that they didn't apply that standard to ether, then.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:59:28
Yes, in a transaction, the public key is exposed on expenditure. That's how the signature is able to be checked so the transaction can be verified.

SegWit increases the maximum blocksize from 1MB to 4MB. That is why there are many 3.6MB blocks mined on the testnet and segnet. You can also verify the size of the blocks on your local disk, if you're running a Segwit-enabled node, and you'll see many which are larger than 2MB.
If you're still confused, let me know.

Factom is a federated satellite blockchain, considering that it is anchored into (and thus relies on) Bitcoin. It is one of the few out there that actually makes economical sense, and helps Bitcoin in turn, because it allows non-transactional data to be Merklized off the main-chain and embedded via tiny anchors, which helps Bitcoin scale over the long-term. 
So, in short, Factom *is* rather unique, as far as altcoins go. But even Factom makes sense as a sidechain, once that tech is perfected, so while speculating on factoids in the short term can be a good way to net some profit, you should always be cognizant of the long-term trajectory of these things and be careful not to "hodl" *any* altcoin (including factoids) over too long of a time horizon.

Perhaps you should try to figure out *why* Core has, almost unanimously, rejected a hard fork to raise max blocksize.
Of course a hard fork wouldn't be contentious if everyone agreed that it was a good idea. But pretty much everyone who has a clue agrees that it is a bad idea right now.

Yes, for remote value transmission, Bitcoin is demonstrably cheaper than alternatives like credit cards.
Yes, for asset delivery and final settlement, Bitcoin is many orders of magnitude faster than alternatives, which take many months for settlement to occur. Bitcoin takes minutes to hours (days in extreme situations when a disproportionately low relative fee is paid).


You're correct on this count. Bitcoin is not yet more convenient than alternative value transmission or storage mechanisms. Not even close. Of course, this is the low hanging fruit that is being developed right now, so this will likely be changing dramatically in the near-to-mid-term future.
Other criteria include **portability**, in which Bitcoin is far superior to alternatives (memorize a mnemonic and waltz merrily across any border in the world), **security**, in which Bitcoin very different from traditional forms of money (and fundamentally superior, although with major undeniable caveats), **infrastructurally developed**, in which Bitcoin is without a doubt far inferior to most alternatives (which is one of the biggest caveats when discussing security, considering the "practical security" afforded by a robust industry designed to accommodate payment reversals by socializing thefts among the wide customer base in the form of fees), **resistance to seizure and censorship**, in which Bitcoin is undeniably superior without debate, and **inflation-resistant / rational to possess over long time horizons**, in which Bitcoin is only paralleled by gold and similar commodities.
So, yeah, your list is not only quite mistaken on the criteria that you *did* list, but woefully incomprehensive, too.

Oh man, this is sad. I just called you out for not focusing on the issues I've raised, and you decide to type up a long comment not focusing on the issues I've raised. Are you seriously doubling down on the "desperately change the subject" strategy? Bold move, Cotton.


I'll give you a hint: they're littered everywhere in this thread. It's almost like I've made expository comments in this thread, and they're easily identifiable because reddit highlights comments from the OP. So you can pretend that you don't see them, but you're not going to fool anyone.
Here's another hint: if you're not talking about sidechains and Mimblewimble, you are off-topic. Notice how those two things haven't even been mentioned in both of your comments? I certainly do.


Read my previous comment. I didn't disregard them, I flat-out destroyed you for bringing them up because they are irrelevant, disingenuous, and not indicative of the community sentiment. One more hint: every single shitcoin tries to take the tack "Don't buy our shitcoin (lol)", including BitShares, Dogecoin, and Ethereum. It is a very transparent tactic (an attempt at reverse psychology) and no one falls for it except toddlers. 
Again, you're doubling down on the "desperately change the subject" strategy. Every word you type that doesn't have to do with sidechains or Mimblewimble is a word used to try to distract from the argument. It's pathetic.


I have. Read my prior comment. 


What I'm doing is disparaging the community because **not one of you, yourself included, has been able to address my arguments** and this entire thread is littered with hilariously-failed attempts. This was your chance to show off that you guys had put some thought into this. Evidently no one has.


You're right, you didn't make any arguments except for "You're being mean and Monero is *so much more* than a shitcoin!" Which I then tore apart.
See, the thing is, I'm not only addressing your weak little appeal-to-emotion, I'm addressing **everything** that your best and brightest (lolol) have managed to throw at me, which boils down to "Bitcoin is le cancer". This is actually impressive, because I haven't just embarrassed you in particular, I've embarrassed **all of you at once**. 
You and your community have an opportunity to make a logical argument in favor of Monero over a sidechain like Mimblewimble. You don't seem capable of doing so, so instead you try misdirection and ad hominems. By giving you guys a chance and watching you squander it this badly, I'm learning more about the quality of thought that this community is capable of than I could with months of passive observation. This is your moment to prove your worth, and none of you can rise to the challenge. This individual thread has told me all I need to know about Monero's future. 


Hahahahahhaha, yes, I read your comment, and then I told you that it was ridiculous that you were changing the subject to something that has *nothing* to do with cryptocurrency. You just rekt yourself.


Yes, you changed the subject... That's my point.


At this point I had to take a step back and question whether you were making an extremely-long-winded attempt at satire. After careful consideration, I realized that no, you're being serious. Imagine what that must be like: your attempted rebuttal is so hilariously bad that it *actually* gave me Poe's Law-esque doubts. 


What I wrote was basically "Let's talk about the implications of sidechains and Mimblewimble on the long-term-viability (or lack thereof) for Monero". Notice how you never even came close to mentioning sidechains or Mimblewimble? That means you didn't respond to what I wrote, at all. You tried to change the subject, failed, and you're still trying to do so.


You want me to tag your username on each of my comments in this thread? Why would I do that? I didn't realize you would deliberately pretend like you couldn't see them so that you don't have to address them. I thought you would be able to respond intelligently and defend the Monero model on its merits, and show me something I hadn't seen before. I had no idea you were this cowardly and had absolutely no *actual substance* to bring up. I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
Rather than asking me to tag your username in each of my comments in this thread, how about you read the thread first, and *then* try to compose a substantive reply? 
Of course, we both know you already read the thread and that you know my argument(s), or at least the gist of them. You're pretending like you don't because you naively think that this will absolve you from having to worry about them, and instead you can focus all your energy into ad hominems and subject changes.

You asked for an ELI5, actually, so what you were looking for was a not-too-technical breakdown, which is what I provided.
Here is an easy-to-understand (hopefully even for a layman like you) example: because Bitcoin transaction-validation spends time hashing dependent on the square of the transaction size, if you just increase the limit and nothing else, I could trivially craft transactions that take multiple hours to verify. The 2MB implementation offered by Classic adds a new limit to sighash-heavy transactions, opening up a whole new can of worms.
A naive 2MB fork (as in the Classic implementation) would also result in accelerated UTXO growth, which is yet another can of worms.
Since you asked for an ELI5 originally, I'll try to honor that once more: **a 2MB hardfork would basically be like trying to convert a canoe into a submarine with a bunch of band-aids**.
Now, if you want to review the code changes firsthand, so you can see what these band-aids look like in practice, I'll help you get started:

It's so strange that so many people like to do what you're doing here. Normally it happens a lot in and other similarly-idiotic subreddits where they aren't able to actually have thorough or logical discussions.
I say something, and immediately someone fires back by crying "So you're saying this completely different thing, huh?" Um, no. I said what I said, not that weird series of words that you're trying to force into my mouth.
In any case, the tactic doesn't work that well in text-based communications, because I can continually remind the person of my actual quotes and prove that their butchered and bastardized versions don't match what I actually said. It would be a lot harder to handle in verbal debates, maybe that's why your type is so desperate to use it.

The token would represent (or be redeemable for) equity in Bitfinex.
Depending on the specifics of the token/agreement, it could potentially represent a profitable investment *if* you believe they will weather this storm and survive meaningfully as an exchange.
I have seen absolutely **zero** indication that they intend to use a blockchain for this token. As far as I can tell, it would be an internal token without any public blockchain attached.
You seem severely confused. Perhaps you should do some further reading before spouting off any more.

For Monero's ring signatures to work (which allow it to be private) it needs to inflate indefinitely. In other words, there is not a hard cap on the number of XMR coins that will exist, like there is with Bitcoin (21 million). The rate of inflation in Monero will drop to a low rate, but there will always be coins being produced.
For investment purposes, this is not ideal. It can be argued whether it is a good or a bad thing in other contexts, but if you're solely looking at the coin as an investment, the infinitely-inflationary supply is less attractive than a finite-supply alternative like Bitcoin.

Poloniex has been relatively good so far, but not perfect. I recall they suffered from a pretty sizable hack a little while back, something like 9000 BTC lost, but they were able to make everyone whole and continue operations.
I have a couple of coins on there, for what it's worth. I wouldn't be incredibly surprised if they fell prey to a huge catastrophe (a couple of friends of mine are on record saying "Poloniex is next, mark my words") but no huge red flags yet that I've seen.

Donning a not-*too*-far-fetched tinfoil hat for a moment, it's somewhat believable that this is the endgame of the "let's wrest governance from the Bitcoin Core devs at all costs" movement that embodies. Get the community riled up for hard forks and ridicule the "loss of decentralization" tradeoffs enough, throw enough sockpuppets into the mix, and stretching the 21M limit doesn't seem too hard.

Everything you just wrote indicates that you don't even have a cursory understanding of what sidechains are, much less what they are capable of.
The 21 million coin limit is unthreatenable with sufficient sidechain deployment. Everything else is effectively infinitely versatile, including but by no means limited to fungibility and mechanisms to affect it, scalability of the base layer and mechanisms to affect it, and the geographic distribution of mining (and the hash functions that define it). 
Since you clearly haven't read the sidechains whitepaper, you should probably set aside some time to do so. Shit will blow your mind.

Anyone seriously interested in the future of crypto absolutely **must** understand what sidechains are and what they are capable of.

Everything else is effectively infinitely versatile, including but by no means limited to fungibility and mechanisms to affect it, scalability of the base layer and mechanisms to affect it, and the geographic distribution of mining (and the hash functions that define it).

You had no such thing; you were owed ETH by Bitfinex in the form of a liability on their books. In other words, you were a creditor from Bitfinex's perspective. Unless you have an explicit, nonstandard arrangement with them, you enjoy no special privileges relative to other Bitfinex creditors. This is entirely irrespective of what specific asset your liabilities are denominated in.


They *have taken* 36% of it, because again, you are not special. You are just another creditor to them, and right now, they have announced that they intend to compensate you (and other creditors) with BFX tokens. Maybe this will work out, maybe it won't, but it's silly to think that you should receive preferential treatment as a creditor when there is no legal precedent of that ever happening anywhere under any circumstances.

Monero will trend to a value of 0 BTC, just like every other shitcoin. Glad that people are experimenting, and I'm sure they always will, but sidechains are objectively a superior testing and sequestering platform (or mechanism, if you will) to distinct chains.
I appreciate that you like Monero and might even have somewhat noble (if misguided) reasons for doing so. Beyond that, playing around with different tech is fun, and we all like to fantasize about being an earlier adopter than we were.

Any cryptocurrency that will rationally trend to a value of 0 BTC per token in the long term qualifies as a "shitcoin" to me. Others may use the term more selectively, e.g. to refer to coins that provide no innovative or interesting new features relative to the codebase they were based upon, but I don't find that definition or criteria particularly relevant.
As of right now, I'm unaware of any altcoins that are **not** shitcoins, because to date, no crypto has been envisioned (much less built) that isn't better suited as a Bitcoin sidechain.

The math doesn't check out on that. If the price keeps doubling, the block reward (in real value terms) is remaining constant despite the halvings. *Assuming* that for each reward halving there is also a price doubling, the network would be no more dependent on transaction fees in 2035 (or 2050, or 2080, or 2100) than it is right now.
Basic stuff.

You can charge fees to route payments, so yes. Interestingly, through this, Lightning might actually provide a meaningful incentive to run a full *Bitcoin* node, too (as running one alongside/behind your LN node is really the best and safest [and arguable only] way to operate). Incredibly exciting.


The opposite, actually. It would allow Bitcoin to have as low of a [CONOP]( as possible, at scale. Also, compared to the *trusty* centralized payment hubs (e.g. Coinbase) that we have today, Lightning Network represents a strict improvement. It would inarguably be better than the status quo for Lightning Network to start replacing the payment hubs that exist and operate today.
One thing not many people acknowledge is that *we already have* a layer-two; that's what Coinbase and BitPay et al represent. Unfortunately they require custody of your funds, which Lightning Network obviates.

Well, Bitcoin **did** increase the blocksize limit (that's what SegWit did). The old 1MB limit was removed and replaced with a new *weight* limit that works out to a little less than 4MB. Just the other day a few 2.2-2.3 MB blocks were mined on Bitcoin.
The cool part is that SegWit *also* did a lot more than just raise the size limit: it paved the way for many other improvements (both on-chain and off-chain), and did it all in a cleverly backwards-compatible way.
The people who say Bitcoin still has a 1MB limit are either confused or lying.

Read the rest of my comment, and Peter Todd's post on soft forks. I explained exactly what I mean, and even gave you supplemental reading material to learn more.
TL;DR: if you get clever enough, you can change pretty much anything with a soft fork.


It is true. Read Peter Todd's post. Vitalik has a couple other posts on the subject, too. So does Paul Sztorc. There are a few threads on BitcoinTalk about it, too (one by jl2012 if I recall correctly).


The "new rules" can be a subset of the old rules. In other words, the miners can remove rules with this mechanism.
Think through it.


The bytes of witness data are in the exact same data structure they always were (the block itself). 
[See this excellent visualization of how SegWit works.](
You *severely* misunderstand SegWit. Stop trying to argue and start trying to learn.


How ridiculously ironic!


Yes, it is. Do a byte-wise analysis of a block (or see Yoghio's visualization above, where he saves you the trouble). Talk to Wuille (or any developer who knows how SegWit works). **You're wrong**, I'm sorry. Now go fix that.


No, it's a soft fork because the new serialization technique allows the witness bytes to be selectively stripped or pruned before relaying the block data to an older node. This doesn't mean those bytes are "outside of the block" (you fell victim to a myth on that one), it means *they can be thrown away* without garbling the rest of the transaction in the process, *if needed*.


What? No. The witness data has always been serialized along with the rest of the transaction data (and has always been "interspersed" if that's how you want to awkwardly phrase it). The new serialization technique simply moves the witness bytes to the *end* of each transaction (and clearly marks them) so that selective witness pruning is possible on the fly.
**Educate yourself already. You sound ridiculous.**


You sound ridiculous. You need to learn how SegWit works, my friend.


In the case of SegWit, the 1MB rule *was* removed. It was replaced by a 4M WU rule. That's why there are so many [blocks bigger than 1MB]( these days. That 1MB rule was [completely removed]( from Bitcoin's code, months ago. It doesn't exist any more. It is no longer part of the consensus ruleset. 


Plenty of knowledge and insight, but I can only lead the horse to water.
@_date: 2016-04-20 15:45:18

It sounds like you don't understand a few things:
1) The punchline of the joke that was making above.
2) What I was referring to above, and why a backlog of waiting transactions is a good thing for the health of the Bitcoin network (especially over the long terrm).
3) Bitcoin's value proposition in general.
4) What "high fees" indicates about "demand for Bitcoin's value proposition".
5) The length of time it takes for traditional/legacy remote payments to finalize (i.e. reach a point of irreversibility analogous to a Bitcoin confirmation). It is typically *months*.
6) The fact that "slow" and "expensive" are actually countervalent descriptors with regards to a Bitcoin transaction and its confirmation expectations.
7) The technical community's general response and approach to Bitcoin scaling (and transaction speeds) while retaining (or improving) its decentralization and fundamental value.
Frankly, judging from your first comment above, your response here, and the accompanying downvote, the level of insight or quality discourse that can be expected out of you seems rather dismal. I feel regret already for spending as much time as I have in interacting with you.

There is no "signature extension block", so you just did an excellent job of demonstrating just how little you understand about SegWit.
SegWit works via a new *transaction serialization* technique, which allows the witness bytes of SegWit transactions to be selectively pruned before relaying the block data to a pre-SegWit node. The bytes of every transaction, whether SegWit or legacy, **including the witness bytes**, are included in the normal block like always, they are not actually segregated into any "extension block" like you seem to believe.
How hilarious that you've demonstrated your incompetence *yet again* with this comment. 
Go ahead, blame it on SEO, you astoundingly incompetent fellow!
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:07:55


Absolutely false. The vast majority of upgrades to Bitcoin aren't even forks, much less hard forks.
You may be referring to *consensus changes* specifically, but even with those, as pretty much any conceivable upgrade can be implemented via a soft fork (yes, even blocksize increases), and since the landscape has become so politically charged by now, there's actually a distinct possibility that Bitcoin **never** hard forks as it continues its global takeover.
It's neat stuff!


Not even **close** to half. Not a single metric indicates that even *20%* of the community tried to follow *any* of the various airdropped altcoins (BTG, BCH, BTF, BTW, UB, etc).


Nope, again, see above.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:39:37




Not necessarily.




Through the clever addition of new rules, you can remove old rules. It's actually a scary facet to soft forks; they can effectively do anything. 
[Peter Todd wrote a great explanation here]( if you're interested in some reading on the subject.


Oh boy, I *really* expected more out of you. There isn't a "separate structure" for the witness data or anything like that; this is a common misconception regarding SegWit.
SegWit enables a new transaction *serialization* technique, whereby the witness data (**which is still in the same old block, the bytes mixed in with all other transactions' bytes**) is easily separable from the rest of the transaction, such that it can be selectively stripped/pruned when the block is relayed to nodes running a version prior to 0.13.1.
I am honestly very disappointed that you, of all people, don't seem to understand this yet. For shame.

To be clear, I did not bring up the Lightning Network, so this is a change of subject. However, you've asked a valid question.
The answer is **no**; you can only receive bitcoin on the Lightning Network if you have a channel open already.
There are other (significant) limitations to the Lightning Network, too, beyond just that one. It is not a scaling panacea  by any means, nor is anyone trying to market it as such. However, a crucial point that many people seem to miss is that the Lightning Network represents an opt-in layer which enables instant, trust-free transactions without any negative full-node externalities or consensus-centric costs of its own. What this means is that once it is mature, *even with its limitations*, it will represent a way *around* on-chain costs.
We have seen mountains of evidence of contrived transaction activity, almost always accompanied by social campaigns by certain parties to spread a narrative that "Bitcoin has high fees and this means it is doomed"; when anyone is free to amortize those fees over arbitrary-length transaction chains (effectively meaning they can be reduced to negligible levels by anyone interested in cost-reduction, at any time), this narrative becomes utterly untenable. Suddenly, any benefits that "spamming" the blockchain might otherwise have yielded are out the window. Low-value, established-relationship, and/or frequent-payment use-cases can (and almost certainly will) be conducted on the new layer, freeing up capacity on the blockchain itself, compounding the futility of continued (deliberate) transaction/chain bloat.
I've seen estimates that legitimate economic activity on Bitcoin is on the order of 200-500kB per block. Perhaps that's higher by now; in any case, it seems more than likely that the competition over quick block-inclusion or confirmation will be significantly less *impressive* in contexts where a fully-functioning Lightning Network exists atop the bottom layer.
In other words, if things go reasonably well, new users will be able to get bitcoins on-chain without massive fees.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:30:42
A persistent pool of fee-paying transactions pending confirmation is **a good thing**.

The miners take a bunch of Bitcoin transactions, bundle them up into a list, attach one to the front of the list that says "pay 12.5 BTC to my mining address, which didn't exist before this block", and then toss in a random number (the "nonce") and hash the entire thing with the SHA-256 algorithm, twice. If the end result starts with enough 0s (which you can't tell whether it will or it won't without actually trying it) then the block is "valid" and they show it to all other miners, who accept it and start trying to build on top of it. If it doesn't start with enough 0s, they add one to the nonce value, and try again. They do this trillions of times per second, basically just guess-and-checking over and over and over. If they get lucky, they get to keep that 12.5 BTC from that one transaction that pays themselves (out of thin air), which is called "the coinbase transaction" and it's the only type of transaction that allows bitcoins to be created from nothing. If they tried to make more than 12.5 BTC (or whatever the current "coinbase" value happens to be, since it divides in half every four years) then the whole block is invalid and the rest of the network ignores it completely.


No, not really. A bitcoin is an abstract concept. There's no "file" that gets sent like what you're imagining. Instead, every single bitcoin comes from a coinbase transaction (meaning that at some point, a miner created it out of thin air via the process described above), and whoever has control of the *private key* which can issue a valid *signature* for the *address* that the coinbase transaction went to, is allowed to "send" those coins to any other address with such a signature. There is no "file" that moves, but the *available balance* from the first (sending) address gets subtracted from, while the balance of the second (receiving) address gets added to. From then on, the receiver can "send" the coins using the same technique (authorizing the send to a new address with a valid signature from their own).
It's a big ledger (database) of balances, which everyone running a "Bitcoin node" is keeping track of. Whenever a new block is added to the chain (by a lucky miner producing it), every node updates its ledger/database to make sure the balances are changed accordingly.
So the "coins" don't actually get "sent" like files do when you attach them to an email. Instead, addresses have their balances subtracted from or added to, and we conceptualize or visualize it as "coins being sent" because that is easier to understand and imagine.

It's not so much a function of "less transactions"; though we're not seeing all-time-highs on this figure at the moment, it's still [up significantly from the figures seen mid-2017]( when the mempool was growing and growing (rather than being eaten through like it is now).
A much bigger causative factor is the recent hashrate spike since the last difficulty adjustment, which is resulting in significantly more blocks being produced than normal (in the last 24 hours, [185 blocks have been mined, which works out to an average of 7.23 minutes per block]( over 25% more than the normal rate and a rate that we haven't seen in over 3 years). When the difficulty next adjusts upward in another week, this effect will be curtailed.
The transaction rates being lower than the all-time-highs seen in the last month or two has helped, too, but it most certainly isn't the primary factor here, and if the hashrate weren't up so much, the backlog would almost certainly still be *growing*, not falling.
The hashrate being up makes economic sense, too; hashrate booms in general should follow/lag price booms, as the cost to produce is temporarily lower than the coin price, which leaves a market inefficiency ripe for exploitation, and there's no way to instantaneously produce more mining ASICs to take advantage of this opportunity. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:45:12
Evidently you do not do much research; a 19MB blocksize limit would not be realistically supportable right now, and numerous independent research papers and professional analyses have indicated that 8MB in the adversarial case would probably be the maximum tolerable limit these days.
Even the big mining pools themselves (or most of them, anyway) have explicitly reaffirmed these conclusions in public statements.
It's such a pity that so many people are willing to chime in about technical parameters without ever having spent a few days reading over the information and analysis that is out there. The Dunning-Kruger effect is such a lamentable phenomenon.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:55:18
The blocksize limit was 1MB. It is now much higher than that (4M WU, which is a hypothetical maximum of 4MB, a practical maximum of 3.7MB, and a realistic maximum of about 2.7MB).
There was consensus for increasing the blocksize limit (that's what SegWit does), just not via a hard-fork that offers no benefits beyond a limit bump.

For the same reason that high-quality food costs more than crap food. Demand for the good stuff is higher, so the price follows suit.
The bottom layer of a blockchain stack is not the optimal layer for maximizing speed or minimizing fees when operating at any significant level of scale. You can improve speed or reduce fees with trade-offs (usually at the expense of decentralization and by incurring deadweight loss), but as this fundamentally contradicts the entire value proposition of a blockchain architecture in the first place, it's an irrational trade-off to make in the long term (especially so when the benefits can be realized *without* making such sacrifices on higher layers of the stack).

I have expressed no misunderstanding here. You seem to misunderstand the situation, but I am happy to help you learn more.
[Over the past 24 hours, the average Time Between Blocks has been 7.65 minutes]( while the figure that difficulty adjusts to target is 10 minutes. The difficulty will not adjust for another 11-12 days, though (currently this is estimated to be around [February 02, 2018 17:08]( The difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is not instantaneous, nor even performed on a per-block basis; instead, it happens [once every 2016 blocks]( As such, there are periods (in particular when a significant amount of hashrate has fired up since the last difficulty adjustment occurred) where the average time between blocks drops significantly, and in fact, [we are currently at the lowest "average time to mine a block in minutes" figure seen in over two years]( (actually, over 3).
The [hashrate has increased almost 20% since the last difficult adjustment, in fact]( corroborating what I have said above.

For a great number of reasons. To list a few... It means that as the inflation subsidy dwindles over the next decade, Bitcoin isn't at risk of a systemic collapse; as it stands, without a pool of pending (fee-paying) transactions, there is a risk vector wherein it becomes more profitable and rational for miners to *re*-mine fee-heavy blocks rather than build on top of them, extending the chain. This would become a serious threat after one or two more reward halvenings, assuming there wasn't a substantial and persistent quantity of transactions in the mempool. Fortunately, it looks like we will be fine on this front, since we have a backlog that doesn't seem to be getting eaten through every few days or weeks.
It also indicates that Bitcoin's value-proposition (a decentralized network offering set-in-stone fundamental properties [e.g. the inflation rate and total supply] and immutable, push-based pseudonymous payments that are extremely resistant to selective censorship) genuinely *does* represent a sustainable model over the long-term, and has been empirically validated as more than just an interesting speculative vehicle. In the presence of a transaction backlog and rising fee-rates, the demand for Bitcoin confirmation is currently having its inelasticity being demonstrated in a remarkably heartening way. With Bitcoin, we are beginning to see (arguably for the first time) that the network may actually survive the decades to come, because it is apparently worth what people are paying to use it (and until very recently this was hotly contested by very smart people, on the basis of no meaningful evidence existing to support the hope).
Furthermore, the persistent presence of a backlog of fee-paying transactions serves as a very helpful and meaningful incentive for network participants to optimize processes and use-cases (and stop abusing those that externalize costs onto other actors in the space). A well-known example is that of SatoshiDice, which used to notify losing bettors by sending them 1-satoshi payments on-chain. This was not only incredibly wasteful, but it reprehensibly bloated the UTXO set in ways that *every* fully-validating node has to deal with; it costs real resources to validate, transmit, and store this data, meaning that *even today* people are having to pay for SatoshiDice's negligence. Similarly, Coinbase has apparently been demonstrating remarkable incompetence by way of UTXO management and transactional behavior, in ways that cost *others* far more than it cost *them*. Some services offer "crypto graffiti" whereby (in some cases illogically un-prunable) data is embedded into the blockchain, which has similar negative effects on the network at large. Without a compelling reason to stop doing so, users, companies, and services will continue to abuse the network; we used to rely on "begging them to stop" for the most part, which isn't very effective in practice, and to date, the only fair and reasonable solution that I am aware of to the problem is the presence of a *real* fee-market, forcing the costs of such activities to more closely reflect the costs they externalize to the rest of the network.
There are more reasons, but this comment is already getting a little long. As can be seen by my downvotes above, most users simply haven't reached the level of understanding necessary to appreciate these things; people think "cheap good, expensive bad" because, frankly, most of them are ignorant. Bitcoin will (apparently) continue to grow and prosper despite these widespread misunderstandings, though!

There are more than 3 and no one is "elected", nor does that word even make sense in context. The people with direct commit access are not making political decisions or anything like that; they are granted commit access if they are frequently making code updates that are constantly being merged in (because they are uncontroversial improvements), as a means of speeding up the process. Commit access is revoked (most of the time willingly) when they stop contributing so frequently, because it's **not** a position of political power, it's just a means of streamlining updates.
Basically, if a change or update is considered controversial by any of the open source contributors to Core (most of whom do not have commit access and who likely wouldn't even want it were it offered), assuming even somewhat reasonable arguments are put forth against the update, it doesn't get merged.
The whole "politicization of development" phenomenon has fortunately been adamantly resisted by Bitcoin Core as a project, and found its footing only in knockoff repositories (so far).

Please quantify that. What is "surprisingly cheap", specifically, according to your calculations?


The opposite, actually. We've just seen it demonstrated beyond argument that even if competitive confirmation fee-rates rise considerably, the network remains completely *sustainable*.
Bitcoin hasn't broken whatsoever; it has demonstrated beautiful and encouraging resilience.


That sounds great. We have seen what the biggest players *in Bitcoin* are able to do with their forces, and the only way for "bigger players" to "take a swing" is to *get involved with Bitcoin*. The beauty of that is, getting involved with Bitcoin strengthens it, whether you want (or intend) it to, or not. If "bigger players" than Ver, Wu, and Armstrong want to start "taking swings", that's great news, and yes, it's *good for Bitcoin*. ;)


An opt-in second-layer allowing near-total circumvention of on-chain confirmation costs (or at least the radical amortization thereof) would represent, effectively, as perfect of a "fix" as has yet been conceived. Fortunately, exactly that is now gradually firing up.

The data field is where arbitrary bytes go (it can be used like OP_RETURN is, or to trigger something in a contract being sent to).
Anyway, you're right, ETH doesn't expire transactions. However, an important note is that (because of their per-transaction nonce usage), the address spending that transaction is completely unusable until either that transaction confirms, or is manually replaced by another using the same nonce.

He's not trolling, nor stupid. There is a possibility that solutions are discovered which render a backlog unnecessary for Bitcoin to remain sustainable in the mid/long-term, but as it stands right now, multiple different research teams have independently discovered that yes, a persistent backlog of fee-paying transactions *are* necessary for Bitcoin to survive the next decade or two if the halvening schedule remains as it is and the subsidy continues to dwindle as planned.
So far, the peer-review that these reports have received have corroborated the conclusions therein.

I haven't "missed" anything of the sort, though it sounds like you might have missed quite a bit.
Five years ago, one of the biggest concerns for Bitcoin's longevity was "will it be able to survive a transition to a primarily fee-based incentive structure?" and many developers, engineers, and enthusiasts were *more* than skeptical that this would be possible. Many people argued that this just wasn't realistic. Mike Hearn (an ex-Google-employee who built the Java library BitcoinJ) infamously rage-quit from contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem entirely because he argued, and firmly believed, that the demand elasticity for block confirmation was effectively zero. Gavin Andresen (an early contributor to Bitcoin development who started the GitHub repository that now houses Bitcoin Core) considered exploring and facilitating a working fee-market to be one of his top priorities (prior to 2013), because even though we *know* that Bitcoin needs a fee-market to develop in order to be able to sustainable in its current form over long-term time horizons (and we *know* that this was Satoshi's vision all along, as it was explicitly described as such), until recently, we were mostly just crossing our fingers and hoping that this strategy might actually work. 
In 2014, Bitcoin started to gradually approach the point where non-zero fees might be occasionally necessary to ensure quick confirmation, and a very interesting campaign to prolong the development of a fee-market began. Andresen flip-flopped on his original priorities, apparently at Hearn's insistent prodding, and the duo pushed for (untenably) massive block-space limitation increases (despite the absence of practical fraud-proofs that would allow for proper SPV security, despite the near-unanimous blowback from the engineering and development community to this approach, and despite the fact that this is precisely tantamount to admitting that Bitcoin is doomed in the mid- to long-term, i.e. the next two to three decades).
One of the objections to the approach is that without meaningful incentives to behave efficiently or responsibly with the (necessarily costly by design, and redundantly so, at that) data inclusion into Bitcoin blocks, multiple tragedies-of-the-commons would manifest; costs would be externalized to the network in worse and worse ways (a la SatoshiDice's losing-bettor single-satoshi notifications, blockchain-graffiti services, and Coinbase's horrendous UTXO and transaction mismanagement), the development of *actual* long-term-sustainable solutions would be regrettably prolonged, and useful data regarding the actual elasticity of blockspace demand would be prevented from ever materializing in the first place, preventing (or at least impeding) scientific evaluation of the subject in future discussions and analyses. Beyond that, along the same lines as your argument above (except running directly contrary to it), it would embed dangerous and unrealistic expectations in an ever-growing market, exacerbating the above issues even worse for "later on down the road" when the chickens inevitably come home to roost.
Fortunately, Bitcoin persevered admirably against the social/technical attacks, and we got useful empirical data regarding the fee market (it turns out that Hearn was dead wrong, and blockspace demand is surprisingly *in*elastic), responsible practices in the industry were encouraged and incentivized in profound ways while irresponsible ones were killed off (hopefully permanently, in most cases), expectations in the community have been rendered more appropriate to reality while Bitcoin's long-term sustainability is now much less in doubt among the knowledgeable observers in the space, and *true* scalability solutions (e.g. second-layers) have been spurred along in their development profoundly by the circumstances of the market. Necessity is the mother of invention, after all.
You don't seem to appreciate any of this, which is sad, because it's beautiful when you can see it.


Not at all. We need Bitcoin to retain its value proposition, and keep doing its thing, as the rest of the stack and infrastructure around it gets built properly.

Electronic cash is a [term of art]( in cryptography, which can be traced back to [Chaum](
Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer** implementation of e-cash. Its distinguishing property being that it is fundamentally decentralized, and that anyone is free to run a node themselves in order to participate in the network without going through trusted third parties or intermediaries. In other words, **the fact that *you* can afford to run a fully-validating Bitcoin node is what makes Bitcoin special compared to all the other forms of digital cash that came before it**. The proper emphasis should therefore be: "Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:47:20
Technically, you don't *need* to know about *every* other peer/channel available. That would definitely represent maximum levels of connectivity, of course, but it's absolutely possible to have a partitioned Lightning Network (i.e. Lightning Network**s**, plural) existing alongside each other. Similarly, it's totally possible to maintain a less-than-comprehensive local view of the network, despite the limitations in routing to certain destinations that this could result in.
But yes, the issue you're mentioning is real. A universal Lightning Network could theoretically result in a pretty unwieldy graph as it grows. Fortunately, it doesn't require global consensus to morph or update in the same way that Bitcoin does; it's inherently much more flexible by virtue of its location in the stack. Also, as anyone who has played Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon knows, it can be surprisingly easy in practice to establish routes between seemingly-very-separated end-points without necessarily having comprehensive knowledge of the domain in question.

Incorrect on all counts. Like I said, you should work to inform yourself.
SegWit works via a new *transaction serialization* technique, which allows the witness bytes of SegWit transactions to be selectively pruned before relaying the block data to a pre-SegWit node. The bytes of every transaction, whether SegWit or legacy, **including the witness bytes**, are included in the normal block like always, they are not actually "segregated outside of the block" like you seem to believe.
You can see how this works with [this excellent visualization]( if you would like to actually learn more.

Roger Ver pretty much controls the social campaign behind BCH these days. He owns Bitcoin(dot)com, the "btc" subreddit, and a few other high-profile namespaces in the Bitcoin sphere, and pays people to promote his ideals and platforms. (Warning: the following sentence is speculation, and though it is likely true, it has not been proven outright.) He probably entered into a deal with Bitmain a couple of years ago to preserve their covert ASICBOOST exploit at all costs (which he, too, benefits from as the operator of pool(dot)Bitcoin(dot)com) and that is basically the origin story of BCH.

Basically: every byte of witness data is "1 weight unit", every byte of non-witness-data is "3 weight units".
If you were able to make transactions out of witness data only, you could fit 4MB of data in a block. But this isn't really possible in practice. The closest approximation to it was someone crafting pathologically "witness-intensive" transactions (which were a bit silly in their construction), which resulted in 3.7MB blocks being mined on the Testnet.

Gladly, but let's be honest: you're not actually seeking help, you're trying to spread a narrative.


This is a lie, betrayed directly by the rest of your comment. You apparently believe in (and see merit in) **BCH**, which is *not* Bitcoin and is a textbook example of "another crypto". So, off to a rough start here, directly lying right out the gate.


Your argument is literally "it's fine if we sacrifice the peer-to-peer aspect of Bitcoin, I don't understand why anyone thinks that should be a priority in the first place"...
There is a reason why your "argument" isn't finding as much traction as you would like.


The chain is *not* "divided" whatsoever. That doesn't even make sense. The whole point of Bitcoin is that chain divisions are unsustainable; the consensus construct essentially economically forces rapid convergence onto a single chain.
There is only one chain abiding by Bitcoin consensus rules which has the most cumulative proof-of-work. That chain is Bitcoin, period.
The fact that altcoins these days are airdropping their initial supply to Bitcoin holders (and accepting lower difficulty requirements or different proof-of-work functions to facilitate their continued existence) **in no way** indicates that Bitcoin has suffered a chain split. This is another lie.
You seem awfully comfortable lying, it seems.


It would not. Supporting anti-Bitcoin movements and actively fighting against Bitcoin's growth and progress (especially through deliberate deceit and the spread of misinformation) would deprive you of being a Bitcoiner, though.


It's "suitable" in a certain sense, but what is far less suitable is the misinformation campaigns to pretend like BCH *is* Bitcoin, which it is not. In light of this, insisting on the inclusion of "Bitcoin" in the name (especially when a perfectly suitable --  and much shorter and easier to say -- alternative exists) while certain well-funded Bitcoin antagonists try to smear *actual* Bitcoin and use their control of Bitcoin-related channels and namespaces to try to spread false narratives regarding the identities of the respective networks in question, is **absolutely** reprehensible, as you certainly know.
Of course, like I said above, you're not here to *actually* have a sincere dialogue, and you'll almost certainly deliberately refuse to acknowledge most of the points I've just made, because you have a clear agenda here, and no particular affinity for honesty.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:58:57
For one, to participate in the Lightning Network you'll have to set your channel up from a SegWit address.
Fees for transaction confirmation are low right now (2 satoshis/byte will still be confirmed relatively quickly). It is possible that this state persists. It is also possible that it does not, and that a backlog builds back up in the future.
It is up to you whether you want to move your coins to a SegWit address. If they're already coolly secured and it would be a great hassle to do so, you should not worry overly much about it, and you're right, leaving them where they are is perfectly fine. If you'd like to position yourself such that you can reap the benefits of SegWit later on down the line while there is a very affordable opportunity to do so, that is also perfectly fine.
What you probably *should* do at some point is set up a SegWit address, so that whenever you *do* next move your coins (or a portion thereof), you can collect the change with it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:47:03


That is indeed possible, but note that the blocksize limit is larger than that already. We use a block*weight* limit now, which maps to a 2-4MB size limit.
The 1MB limit was removed last year when SegWit activated.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:16:38


No, not at all. Read my comment above; you'll note that I never once said that high fees *cause* bitcoins to be valuable. That would be absurd. This is also a strawman argument that came out of nowhere.


Correct. Good thing I never argued otherwise.


True, in a sense.


Absolutely false, with no basis in reality whatsoever.


It is not unusable for these purposes, and as I explained above, the utility for such transaction types is oriented to increase massively as the full Bitcoin stack is developed, deployed, and refined.


Perhaps. If so, this effect is almost certainly minuscule and negligible.


It seems like you didn't even read my comment above. Now might be a good time to go and do that!
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:15:23
The blocksize limit is now much closer to 4MB than it is to 1MB. The fact that much of the block capacity remains unused actually demonstrates how low of a priority "cheap transaction fees" currently is to the average on-chain Bitcoin transactor.

Honestly, in my humble opinion, this is the single best article ever written on the Lightning Network.
You have managed to distill down the arguments from both sides, stripping away politics as much as possible and giving an absolutely fair treatment to each viewpoint in every case. You have presented the rationale behind the solution, the mechanics of its operation, and a level-headed conclusion on what this might mean for its development and growth.
Furthermore, you have done all of the above without compromising technical accuracy *at all* (that I can see), *and* you have managed to keep things straightforward, understandable, and concise.
None of this is easy to achieve. In fact, it is *incredibly* difficult to achieve even *one or two* of these goals. This piece was incredible, elegant, and worthy of both applause and continual reference as we move forward.

I'm honestly surprised that this was not already the case. Payments from SegWit addresses still send the same old bitcoins to the destination; it's 100% trivial to *receive* them.

It did raise the blocksize limit. That's why (and how) blocks are all bigger than 1MB these days.
Inform yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:10:15


You're proposing *lowering* the blocksize limit? The current weight limit allows for blocks **larger** than 2MB.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:09:40


By using the [anyone-can-spend]( trick. From an old node's perspective, a SegWit transaction is ["non-standard" but valid]( meaning that it won't relay the transaction but it will accept a block including it, and it will treat it as "spendable" even without the full witness information.
This means that older nodes do not fully validate SegWit transactions, in the same way that P2SH transactions (including all multisig transactions) are/were not validated by nodes running pre-BIP13 code.


The TXIDs (which make up the leaves of the Merkle tree which has its root included in the standard block header) of SegWit transactions depend solely on the "base data" (everything except the witness data), which is also how [SegWit solves nonintentional transaction malleability]( Meanwhile, the witness data has a new, distinct Merkle tree, which has its root embedded in the coinbase transaction of the block. So the old node will see the traditional Merkle root in the block header and be able to validate it, and will see the new Merkle root in the scriptPubKey of the coinbase transaction, but will not be able to validate that one. Since it is not enforcing any sort of consensus rules regarding the witness Merkle root, though, this doesn't bother it.
The block hash is a hash of the [header content]( so it is still calculable from an old node's perspective.

Some of us were not so much "proud of big blocks" as we were "happy to have definitive proof against the misinformation campaign and troll talking point that 'SegWit isn't a blocksize increase'"...
I saw plenty of people surprised that the larger blocks were possible at all, and others who had been misled into thinking "1.7MB is the absolute limit SegWit allows" that finally got to see that this isn't true. I was personally very happy to see the blocks larger than 2MB, not because I want bigger blocks (much less bigger blocks processing fewer transactions), but because this really helped put the nail in the coffin of a false narrative that has survived *way* past its expiration date already.
SegWit is a blocksize increase, but that's the least cool thing about it.

If every single action you performed in a game had to be validated by *every* other fully-connected peer on the Internet for the rest of time, it would be analogous to Bitcoin in this respect.

Yes, it does. Thankfully, we have transaction fees as an integral part of that protocol, and they currently represent the only known way of "dealing with it" anyone has ever been able to come up with.
Good thing we have those transaction fees, huh? Satoshi was brilliant.

[As he once explained](




No, actually. Satoshi didn't use Git or GitHub at all, actually. He used Sourceforge/SVN for version control.
What actually happened is that Gavin decided to start the GitHub "bitcoin" project, and made a post on BitcoinTalk saying "I'm doing this, and Satoshi hasn't objected to me doing it!" Satoshi didn't chime in to say "no, don't" or anything like that.
Over time, GitHub became more and more popular, and that's where most devs started contributing to, so it became the de facto "official" Bitcoin repo.
Satoshi didn't hand Gavin the repo, because Gavin started it in the first place. Satoshi never once contributed directly to the GitHub repo, in fact.
What he *did* hand over to Gavin is one of the network alert keys. But he also gave one to Theymos. These were phased out a year or two ago, anyway, so it doesn't make much difference now.
The real issue here is that Gavin felt like it was acceptable to go around championing himself as "Satoshi's successor" and as the "Chief Scientist of Bitcoin", which is something that more principled and scrupulous project contributors did not do. Unfortunately, this meme stuck.

What are you smoking? It **was** raised, months ago. The 1MB limit *is not in the code any more*, which is why pretty much every single Bitcoin block is *larger* than that these days.
*Why* is the Dunning-Kruger effect so prominent around here? How are there so many people like you running around the place chiming in with this noise? It is truly baffling.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:51:51




True, in a sense.


True, in a sense.




True, to a degree. Every transaction published to the blockchain has a cost of processing associated with it, which is externalized to *every* full-node *in perpetuity*. This cost being reflected in the fee necessary to post the transaction in the first place is the only way for meaningful decentralization to be sustainable over the long-term. This is an important insight that relatively few people seem to grasp.


Not everyone does, but **if** Bitcoin fees continue to climb, that *necessarily* means that Bitcoin's demand is likewise climbing, which means that the value of each Bitcoin is correspondingly skyrocketing. So, in a sense, for those who hold BTC, fees growing would be a good thing; it means that we are getting much, much richer. However, there is definitely value in being able to transact in Bitcoin without always incurring massive costs by doing so, so many Bitcoin users/holders might also want fees to stabilize or decrease. Fortunately, there are solutions being explored which give the promise of being able to *amortize* these fees over arbitrary-length transaction-chains, meaning that users of Bitcoin stand to realize *the best of both worlds* as long as the work continues to get done to achieve these goals intelligently.


Perhaps. Of course, through the amortization mentioned above, this could translate to sub-cent fees per actual economic transaction, which (again) gets the best of both worlds.


Such a scenario would probably imply that each individual bitcoin is worth millions of dollars. While this is not entirely inconceivable, it's absolutely not a certainty or anything resembling one.

No, not at all. The vast majority of upgrades to Bitcoin, like the libsecp256k1 optimizations, don't require any fork whatsoever! This is an indisputable **upgrade**, something that is an uncontroversial improvement over what came before it. Trying to use the word "upgrade" to refer to "consensus-breaking changes" in general is a misuse of terminology.

Fortunately this can be done with soft limits, and doesn't need a fork of any kind. I doubt you would get very far in advocating this policy, but it's actually not absurd at all.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:50:51
Doing so *still* initiates a transaction with the qualities described in this post, though. Which means that they're needlessly overpaying, being massively inefficient, and in the process tricking automatic fee-estimators (on wallets, websites, and services) into overestimating the necessary fees for fast confirmation.
What they're doing is dumb, wasteful, and actually somewhat harmful to other users of the network, *even* if you withdraw through GDAX and don't pay that confirmation fee yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:01:28
I think that if you're interested in making base-level protocol changes to increase transaction throughput, a soft-fork blocksize limit increase is probably the most viable option at this point.
Many of the developers/stewards have expressed (well-supported) beliefs that hard-forks represent an unconscionable moral sleight, by virtue of representing an imposition on other stakeholders in contexts where obvious widespread consensus does not exist. Soft-forks sidestep this aspect of things (and though there can be "evil" soft forks, it's certainly possible to err on the side of "good"ness).
But beyond just choosing the soft-fork approach, there's another problem left to tackle for anyone interested in a proposal of this nature, which not many take the time to consider: *should* we want fees to be lower? I personally would answer in the affirmative, but I certainly don't have end-all-be-all ultra-persuasive arguments to support my belief on the matter. "High" fees are good in many ways (as are low validation costs), and many don't bother acknowledging this side of things, which is a shame and tends to render their suggestions much more ignorable than they might otherwise be.

You might want to look a little bit more closely at that chart... it's showing the average blocksize having passed 1MB back in October...
Or heck, [look at the individual blocks themselves]( There's literally been **one** block *smaller* than 1MB in the past 100 blocks mined.
[Sort the blocks by descending size]( to see the biggest first. Or, best of all, check the actual [source code itself]( to see what the limit truly is.

Yeah, just like those using the Internet in 1993 weren't early participants in the network. Right.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:24:12


Close, but not quite. The signature data (witness data) is still in the same location of the block, it's not actually moved anywhere new. But the new SegWit-format transactions are serialized in a new way, so that the witness bytes are "tagged" and moved to the end of the transaction that they are a part of, which makes them identifiable (and strippable) on-the-fly.
This way, when an older node (running a version prior to 0.13.1) requests the block data, the newer node providing it can selectively prune the witness data (i.e. chop it out entirely) before relaying the block over.
Other than that point, well explained!

Um, the 1MB limit was removed many months ago. Pretty much *every single Bitcoin block* these days is larger than 1MB, in fact.
Why are you talking about a limit that doesn't even exist any more? Are you *that* uninformed?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:35:06


It *more than doubles* the blocksize limit, quite literally.
The 1MB limit was removed, it doesn't exist in Bitcoin's codebase any more (and hasn't for a few months now). The blocksize was changed into a block*weight* limit, which correlates to a 4MB size limit. Consensus *was* reached on the blocksize increase that is SegWit, but primarily because it boasts many benefits beyond just a simple limit increase.

Oh goodness, there are so many things obviously wrong with this paper that the most challenging part is just knowing where to begin. It's like "Gish Gallop: The Whitepaper".
Sirer's work in general is pretty laughable 90% of the time, he's pretty firmly established himself in the "academic troll" category, alongside Stolfi.
"Oh well surely if there are issues with the paper then you can enlighten us?" the chorus sneers, taking full advantage of Brandolini's differential. I'll probably get around to a full break-down one of these days when I have some time to kill, but as for now...
* "Bitcoin underutilizes its network" is a gross misrepresentation of what the paper actually argues (a better heading might be "if you were content with the trends towards centralization in 2016, you shouldn't be much more worried today (and let us conveniently fail to mention the *cause* of this relief: tireless optimizations from the engineers involved) and also we demand numerical proof for *a priori* truths that we feel safe calling 'unjustified' because the only people who know enough to realize how silly this claim is already don't take us seriously enough to bother wasting time to once again dig up or spell out the veritable *troves* of arguments and analysis that refutes it"... but I guess that *is* a mouthful)
* Bitcoin has probably ten times (or more) the quantity of full nodes running that the paper claims it does, while the Ethereum figures are overrepresentative, to say the least (really stretching the "full" qualifier to its utmost limits and beyond)
* Nakamoto Consensus is *not* "miners set the rules", as has been proven over and over again in recent Bitcoin history (thereby completely refuting the "Neither Are All That Decentralized" heading, which essentially summarizes a blatant mischaracterization of the consensus model)
* A significant chunk of the paper is dedicated towards trying to subtly shill the Falcon relay network (which is pretty much objectively worse than FIBRE in every sense you'd ever care about, and furthermore a lot of the conclusions drawn are basically based on the assumption that Falcon is so awesome that "why *wouldn't* you want to use it?" while the paper simultaneously admits that it is only connected to roughly *one third* of the total hashrate...) and Sirer's ByzCoin proposal (which deserves its own dedicated essay to fully convey how unimaginably bad it is)
* The paper makes ridiculously overaggressive claims like "we present a **comprehensive** measurement study on decentralization metrics in these operational systems" which is in all honesty just a flat-out lie
* Despite having been published about a week ago, "at the time of writing/observation" seems to be referring to last spring or so (and it is riddled with inaccuracies and chronological incongruities as a result)
* Some of the boldest claims in the paper are supported by hilariously thin logic (know how they concluded that the majority of Bitcoin nodes are hosted in datacenters? Lower peer latencies and average bandwidth provisions! Seriously, that's it! A less biased report would just say "Bitcoin nodes seemed slightly better provisioned in terms of bandwidth, and exhibited lower latencies" but they took the leap to say "so therefore datacenters!" in what appears to be a pseudo-academic rendition of Yellow Journalism)
* They make absolutely *ridiculous* choices such as this one: "In this study, BMS includes nodes that do not supportthe DAO fork [10] in its measurements for Ethereum." ... i.e. *they bundled in Ethereum Classic node measurements*, apparently figuring "heck, why not? Most people don't actually read the paper anyway, and we won't mention this in our summaries or anything"
* They build castles of quicksand on top of castles of quicksand ("While we incentivize miners to relay blocks through Falcon, there is no guarantee that they necessarily will do so [*oh you mean that suboptimal relay network that you previously admitted only about a third of miners even use?*]. We suspect that explicitstorage of uncles in Ethereum captures a larger proportion of pruned blocks [*nah, you think? Shouldn't this be a disclaimer written in all-caps, red font?*].")
* Their whole "fairness" metric is an embarrassingly bad misnomer anyway (a more accurate name for the metric might be "deadweight work loss", and they claim that the ideal ratio value would be 1 when it arguably should be *infinity* instead), not to mention their own admission that *even if you agreed with their posited target value, the metric (or measurement thereof) is broken*: "this
fairness metric is much noisier in Bitcoin compared to Ethereum", after all...
Ugh, I could keep going, but there's really not much point to it. The people who are intelligent enough to recognize this drivel for what it actually is generally already do, and the others won't even understand or internalize what I'm saying anyway.

You seem to misunderstand a few things about SegWit. The transactions are not any smaller than standard P2PKH transactions, generally. However, they have lower *weight*, and because the most rational and profitable mining strategy is to include the transactions with the most *satoshis per weight unit*, SegWit transactions are 20-40% cheaper, on average, than other Bitcoin transactions.
Fees thus drop immediately for SegWit users (when spending from the address) an appreciable amount. Of course, the more SegWit transactions performed, the more network throughput is realized, which you correctly observe would have an even larger impact on the competitive network fee-rates.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:45:17


Did you read the explanations accompanying the images? I have provided that link to about a dozen different people (who each initially misunderstood SegWit like you currently do) and every one of them *except* for you has come away with an understanding of how it works. The only reason I say that the visualization is excellent is because I have seen it impart insight *on multiple separate occasions*. 
For your own sake, please try revisiting it and see if you can "get" it on a closer inspection.


This is factually false. Again, see the visualization to understand how the witness data (and other data) is handled, both with and without SegWit. **It is in the block just like always.** The bytes aren't moved to any separate data structures (this is a myth repeated by people who don't actually look at the code or the block data).


The blocks on Bitcoin no longer have a 1MB limit, so that has changed.


No, SegWit is a soft fork. You can change pretty much anything with a soft fork, actually... especially if you want to get really clever (and don't care about the negative consequences of the fork). You could even theoretically increase the total supply of coins with one.
There's plenty of resources out there if you're interested in learning more about these possibilities. It's one reason why the whole "we must hard fork!" faction is considered such a joke in the technical community.


False. Again, you don't seem to appreciate just how powerful soft forks can be. They can change anything, even fundamental properties, surprisingly enough. You would just have to code them carefully and cleverly.
Of course, just because you *can*, doesn't mean you *should*... but the fact remains that soft forks are incredibly powerful.

There is really not much need to fear hub-and-spoke topology of upper layers, anyway. I expect some hubs to naturally develop, when particular service providers offer consistently spectacular service to end-users and attract widespread demand as a result. And this is not a bad thing.
One of the reasons why Lightning Network is such an attractive solution is because it allows **Bitcoin**, the layer *beneath* it, to remain maximally decentralized. It itself can centralize somewhat without having much of a negative impact on the protocol; the plan has *always* been to build the quick, easy, user-friendly, flexible stuff *on top* of the rock-solid base layer beneath. We can admit centralization (or other stuff like fraud-protection through payment reversibility, or Turing complete expressivity) into the second (or third, or fourth) layers, experimenting with the various models, until we have a fully fleshed out infrastructure supporting all manner of use cases while keeping our foundations as secure and sound as possible.
Anyone who tries to whine about Lightning Network being "too centralized" is inadvertently admitting that they haven't *gotten it* yet. Bitcoin is the foundation, it's the layer we want to be simple, pure, efficient, decentralized, and *minimal*, while the fancy or "trade-offy" stuff is hosted on top of it.
Any engineer worth their salt will tell you the same, assuming they have a halfway-decent understanding of the network and its purpose.
...but I suppose it will take some time for the world to realize these things. For those of us to whom they are obvious already, it vascillates between amusing and frustrating how long it is taking everyone else to see it.

That's not accurate, that's more than double what it would take to get into the next block for any reasonably-sized payment.

You must be joking. Everyone who knows what they're talking about disputes that obvious falsehood.
BCH doesn't maintain consensus with the chain (Satoshi talked at length about how his original vision for upgrade paths was via soft forks whenever possible). It does not have more cumulative proof of work associated with it than real Bitcoin (not even close). It does not have Satoshi's original difficulty adjustment algorithm, nor does it strive preserve the "peer-to-peer" component that Bitcoin is about.
BCH does not even *resemble* Satoshi's vision; the hashrate alone disqualifies it in this regard. The only people who think that are those who don't understand Bitcoin on a technical level.

I considered mentioning that the Merkle witness commitment was separated, in a sense, from the traditional one. Putting things in terms of an "abstract block" is an interesting way to look at it. But I decided that this would further confuse an already lamentably confusing point, and opted for understandability in the end.
The bytes of witness data are still included in the block itself (what you've termed here as "the wire format"), and even the witness commitment is included in that same block, from the perspectives of *both* old and new nodes (via the coinbase transaction). The main distinction I was trying to highlight here is that SegWit doesn't really add an extra "compartment" to each block, as something like an extension block proposal might. It uses the same old preexisting compartments, a new weighting scheme, a witness-specific Merkle root in the coinbase, and selective data prunability to achieve a soft-forked block limit increase.

Bandwidth is a much worse bottleneck and much bigger concern than disk space is. I don't know of any experts arguing otherwise.
With that said, there is still work to do (for fraud proofs) to achieve Satoshi's envisioned security for SPV clients. We're getting there steadily.


Could you please tell me how I specifically "misrepresent" HFTs? Please provide an exact quote (don't sloppily paraphrase me). Thanks in advance.


None of Bitcoin's developers are in favor of "intentionally crippling the network" in any way, either. Why are you so quick to build a strawman like that?

I didn't even say the word "lightning" anywhere in my comment. It sounds like **you're** the one doing the misrepresenting here. An honorable person might consider apologizing to me at this point.


Agreed. That's why SegWit **increased the blocksize from 1MB to 4M WU**. A significant increase.

If you were waiting to buy the dip to $150 when we first broke through $300 (in late 2013) you'd still be waiting to this day.
People *were* waiting to do so. I remember arguing that this was a bad idea at the time.
However, if you were waiting for a dip to *$230*, you actually would have gotten your opportunity to buy at that point, many many months later (after Bitcoin had touched $1100 prices for a little while).
So how do you know whether the $5-6k figure you're hoping for is the equivalent of $150 or $230? Honestly, you can't. The *only* reliable thing established, so far, is that "long term, the price rises" and the rational strategic response to that (and your best bet as a heuristic) is "the sooner you start buying, the better"... trying to time the dips is basically blind gambling.
With that said, we're in the middle of a bubble (like it or not), and I don't particularly advocate buying a big stake at these prices (though of course it might end up being the right call anyway). Dollar cost averaging is a smarter (and much lower-stress) way to start building your stash, if you are interested in doing so.

The 1MB limit was removed months ago. It doesn't exist in the code any more. The blocksize limit is significantly higher than that now.
Most Bitcoin blocks these days are larger than 1MB. It is BCH which has the tiny blocks.

When was the last time you tried to fully validate the blockchain (run a full node), though? I don't mean with "trust the miners, skip validation and rely on a recent checkpoint state snapshot", I mean an actual synchronization and self-validation.
I tried to do so a week ago. It didn't go so well. I have a very nice machine and a good connection, and I *still* had to give up.
The developers of Ethereum *know* that this is an issue, they are fully aware that their network relies on trust at this point, and they don't even try to deny it. I've spoken with a few of them to confirm this, and the ones I haven't spoken with directly also seem to agree. By and large, their "rebuttal" is along the lines of: "Well in the end you're basically trusting someone when it comes to Bitcoin, anyway, because you have to trust that the code you're running and the binary you downloaded are secure, so that's trusty in a way. Also even if our network doesn't quite have deterministic (i.e. mathematically objective) consensus, networks are social anyway, so don't worry about that and trust the social network that you consider relevant."
These are certainly interesting arguments, I'll give them that. But ultimately Ethereum is a network built around "accepting a lot more trust into the fundamental architecture" as a trade-off, whereas Bitcoin is maximally trustless. Make no mistake, though: they are making a *big* trade-off, whether you're knowledgeable enough to recognize it or not.

False. Try last month.

Also false. There were 11.5k of cumulative market sell orders placed that would have driven price down to &lt;$100 (perhaps even to $1 or less) and *that* was when trading was halted (and these trades cancelled).

The interesting thing is that *even* if Ripple succeeds in the financial sector, the users (banks) don't actually have to store or hold XRP (the Ripple token) to use the network.
There's no real reason to expect the token to appreciate significantly in value *even* if you assume the network is adopted or successful in achieving its goals.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:58:41


That's a myth, actually. Satoshi even said that the minrelayfee (a node policy setting introduced a couple months after the blocksize limit was added) was the "first attempt" at addressing transactional spam.
He didn't explicitly say why the blocksize limit was added, but we've since realized that it is a critical component of Bitcoin.

Yes, there was. This is a non sequitur.

Yes. It is supposed to be, and is.


It *is* a choice. Currently, the majority of network transactions have chosen not to use it, in fact.

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:00
It's not a "Core stance", though. Trying to paint it as such shows a pretty sad misunderstanding, in my opinion.
"Core" doesn't control Bitcoin like you seem to think they do. **Bitcoin users** control Bitcoin, and we've chosen to go with a soft-forked transaction upgrade (bundled with a blocksize increase) that paves the way for a multi-layered Bitcoin network that minimizes centralizing strain on the bottom layer.
A *very* vocal, *very* antagonistic minority of users has decided that they don't like this approach; by all objective metrics, they represent *less than 10% of the Bitcoin userbase*. They decided they don't like Bitcoin and the path it is taking, and they decided that they would rather withdraw from the network and try to build their own than to try and cooperate and find some sort of common ground. They launched an altcoin, and they desperately want this altcoin to be seen *as* Bitcoin, when objectively speaking **it is not**. It is truly pitiable; their coin doesn't really offer any features that don't exist in a thousand other coins (many of which have much bigger teams of more experienced developers working on them). Their coin doesn't even boast *ten percent* of the network transaction volume of Bitcoin. It doesn't even have *ten percent* of the value of Bitcoin. It doesn't have even *five percent* of the number of developers working on it as Bitcoin does, and the qualifications and track records of the devs that it *does* have are... unimpressive, to put it lightly.
The nature of Bitcoin is that it is **very, very hard to change** in the face of resistance to that change. In fact, that's where its value stems from; if Bitcoin were *easy* to change by influential people or forces, the critical defining aspects of it (like the 21M coin limit) would not be "set in stone" and it wouldn't really have any strong guarantees when it comes to specific network properties. When you say things like "When you have one faction telling everybody that hard forks are to be avoided at all costs, to me that's a big warning flag", it sounds like you don't like Bitcoin's value proposition (or actually, more likely, that you haven't really spent enough time reading and learning and thinking about it to understand it properly). Bitcoin is valuable *because it naturally resists such coercion*, and yes, that means it can be a bit unruly from the perspective of someone who wants to guide or control it.
Bitcoin will hard fork when we agree that it needs to. Until then, it won't, and **absolutely shouldn't**. I know you don't want to hear any of this, and more likely than not, you'll dismiss me as a "Core fanboy" or some other (perhaps nastier) phrase. But it's not Core that I support (though I *do* respect many of the contributors to Core), it is **Bitcoin**.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:00:26


The opposite, actually.
As the paper explains, without a block subsidy or a transaction backlog, the rational and most profitable mining strategy is to re-mine relatively fee-heavy blocks (rather than building on top of them and extending the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:24:29
I don't think you're understanding anything that I'm saying, unfortunately. Bitcoin supports smart contracts, and as I said at the very beginning, at-the-edge computation is **fundamentally** more economic and efficient than mandatorily redundant computation.
If you don't understand what I mean by this, it's very strange that you're trying to argue against it. You seem to be (rather massively) overestimating your own level of understanding.
Oh well. Best of luck to you in your journey of knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:17:19


No, I just explained what is fallacious about this. BCH is an **airdropped altcoin**, just like CLAMS was a year and a half ago. It is not Bitcoin, it isn't compatible with Bitcoin, it is an altcoin, plain and simple. The fact that it credited Bitcoin holders with a balance (just like CLAMS did, and just like Gold did, and just like Diamond did...) doesn't make it any more Bitcoin than any of these other coins are. It is an altcoin, period.


I don't believe that any of the moderators of this subreddit are Bitcoin Core contributors. I am one such moderator, and though I stay up to date with Bitcoin Core development, I am not "a Core developer" and to the best of my knowledge, neither are any of my fellow moderators.
You're lumping in many disparate subsets of the Bitcoin community as "Core" because you don't seem able or willing to acknowledge the fact that **the Bitcoin community rejected the hard forks proposed so far**, not just Core. It doesn't seem like you're even able to comprehend what "Core" actually *is*, likely because you've fallen victim to a false narrative spread by a malicious minority.


As do I. I have spent *hundreds* of hours reading everything Satoshi ever wrote; I can *guarantee* you that I've spent far more time than you have trying to understand how and what he thought. I'm not bragging here, in a way it is kind of pathetic how obsessive I have gotten in my research. But I can tell you for a fact: frankly, you don't know what you think you know, and for those of us who have spent a lot of time and effort trying to understand the issues, you pretending like you do is comically transparent.


Let me ask you: how many massive-scale distributed networks have you personally overseen the development of? What is your engineering background? Do you have a doctorate in computer science? How many years have you spent wrestling with the problems of distributed consensus, in a professional capacity?
I am willing to bet that if you answer the above questions honestly, it would be embarrassing how underqualified you are to be telling me (and the others here) what "the best way" to do *anything* regarding upgrading Bitcoin is.
I am an engineer who *has* worked on distributed consensus algorithms in a professional capacity. I have literally earned my living by doing so, for years. I can tell you from firsthand experience that this stuff is *nightmarish* when you actually work directly on it; so many "obvious" answers and solutions turn out to be broken and unworkable in ways that you would never have expected until you spent a few days trying desperately to get them to work.
Seriously, the complexity of problems in this space is almost unfathomable. That's one reason why Satoshi's breakthrough is so damn amazing; he brought forth a *practical* solution to a decades-old problem that is actually *rigorously proven to be unsolvable*; he found a way to sidestep the impossibility result by allowing a degree of probabilistic uncertainty that is elegantly reined in by economic rationality (or to phrase it another way, he used *human greed* to achieve a "good-enough to work with" solution). It's absolutely incredible that he managed to make Bitcoin work, but this doesn't mean that we can just "bang on it and hope for the best". There's a lot more to it than you will likely ever realize.


Mine, too. But "electronic cash" is actually a [term of art]( in applied cryptography, and it has *nothing* to do with fees.
Someone who spends large portions of time on cryptographic mailing lists uses the phrase "electronic cash" or "digital cash" in a specific way, and if you're not such a person, you wind up sounding silly if you try to pretend that this phrase carries connotations that it traditionally does not (to cryptographers). Look into Chaum's work if you're interested in learning more.


Nope, that's only a part of it. Miners select and order transactions. Not so scary when you put it that way.


Nope. Nodes serve to allow Bitcoin to be used *trustlessly*, and they are the backbone of the network.
Your last few paragraphs are just parroting more nonsense and misinformational propaganda. If you don't want to spend the time necessary to understand the system, I won't try to convince you to do so. You picked your allegiance, facts be damned, and that's fine. Just try not to get too upset when things unfold in ways that you didn't expect (and if you lose money by being on the wrong side of history); you have no one to blame but yourself. You have the opportunity to learn and grow, but you have chosen to shirk it rather than take it. So be it.

You're talking about the portion of the comment that I had already debunked (multiple times over)? The whole "people aren't using Bitcoin" part? The part that I keep trying to remind you is completely and totally false?


Currency, as in money, can be saved. That's a valid use case of money (a *particularly* valid one in the case of **sound money**). So yes, I do get to say "people are using it, they're saving it" and if you respond by trying to argue that I'm wrong, and that people are *not* using it, then what you are arguing is that no one is saving bitcoins.
Sorry that you chose to argue a false point. That's not my fault, though, so don't blame me.


See above. 
Also, I have not said that you're a liar. I *have* said that by arguing that "no one is using bitcoins" when I have explained that saving bitcoins *is* using them, you are either lying or you don't understand the point I'm making, as there doesn't appear to be any third option or possibility that I can see, and you certainly don't seem to be furnishing one.

Well here's the thing: if no one is waiting in line, you're going to move straight through without issue. But then you owe yourself the question: *why is no one waiting in line here?*
If you think about it rationally, eventually you'll realize an important, valuable insight: "No one is waiting in line because there's no reason to wait in line here."
If you're just trying to buy something from a merchant and they accept any crypto without discretion, sure, pay with whatever you have a balance in that demands the lowest fee when you are issuing payment. If you're trying to make an *investment*, you should spend some time thinking about the value proposition of the coin in question, and compare it against the alternatives. BCH effectively has no value proposition; it is an altcoin trying to distinguish itself via "low fees" while 99% of altcoins offer *lower fees* than it even offers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (actual, real Bitcoin, the coin with the "BTC" ticker) offers an *actually decentralized, immutable, sound money with a finite supply cap and an inviolable ledger, nothing less than Gold 2.0 and the cryptocurrency brand name and standard above all else*. Perhaps you judge this to be worthless, in which case, alright, fine, look elsewhere. On the other hand, perhaps you recognize the value of an immutable, inviolate, apolitical public ledger, which cannot be tampered with no matter how powerful you happen to be, and which will eventually (despite and because of its massive levels of demand) offer *truly* economical (i.e. as-low-as-possible) average fee rates... in which case, welcome aboard Satoshi's wild ride, and glad to have you, bud.

I am not sure what "promised" means in this context (most developers don't make "promises" because of the nature of software development), but the initial estimates were "6-18 months from now we can expect working software" and these were first made in late 2015, as I recall.
It is already available (as of earlier this month), and you can test it out yourself; there are multiple working (and intercompatible) implementations developed by different teams, from eclair to lnd.
Almost all Lightning payments so far are on the testnet, because the software is still alpha quality and because things going wrong could hypothetically result in financial loss, though if you want, you could certainly make a superficial and quick tweak to the code and run a LN node on mainnet. Yalls.org has a mainnet node running already, for instance.
We'll almost certainly see real usage start to occur over the next 2-6 months, but again, the stage that things are at means that you should be careful and expect issues during the early days.

I second what said, that a Core wallet built from source sounds like what you probably want to go with. Rock solid security, and the port not being open shouldn't really matter if you're primarily concerned with your own coins/funds.

False. This is a complete myth and is refuted by Satoshi's own words. When the minrelayfee setting was [first introduced]( (months after the blocksize limit was put in place), Satoshi described it as "a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments".

If zero transactions contained within a block take advantage of the SegWit transaction serialization, the blockweight limit of 4M WU maps to an effective size limit of 1MB.

Yeah, the data and actual facts just don't support the conspiracy theory that "Blockstream control Core/Bitcoin", and in fact, thanks mostly to John Newberry, ChainCode Labs have actually been "controlling" a lot more recent Core development than Blockstream have.
It seems like the anti-Bitcoin crowd (i.e. the rbtc community) primarily rely on emotional arguments (pathos) rather than facts or logic, and having a "boogeyman" plays well into such narratives. They picked out Blockstream as their "source of all evil" a while back, and are now committed to this conspiracy theory, no matter how ridiculous and unrealistic it is and no matter how many hoops they have to jump through to preserve the fantasy. It's a really interesting phenomenon to observe, honestly. The mental gymnastics get (literally) insane at some points.

I read it, and it's fantastic. I did an excellent job of identifying the misinformation, and ousting the misinformant concisely.
The underlying topic is *not* emotive; it is dry, technical, and objective. The only emotive aspect is the **deliberate proliferation of misinformation**, in this case performed by the kittenrevenge user (who exposed themselves as a troll in the rbtc subreddit post that I linked to above).
But hey, a 5-week-old sockpuppet account showing up to accuse a longstanding community member of "cranking up tensions" when they simply correct falsehoods with facts and accompanying citations? Unsurprising, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:09:12
It doesn't seem natural that people in a **Bitcoin** forum aren't receptive to a coin specifically trying to scam and confuse Bitcoin users and a community that has done nothing but try to attack Bitcoin over the past two years?
Roger Ver is a proven liar who seems to be paying lots of money to astroturf this subreddit on a regular basis, and is intent on pushing BCH as "the real Bitcoin" when it is obviously anything but. You seem relatively new (and uninformed), especially if you think rbtc has anything even *resembling* honest debate, so perhaps you just honestly don't know enough of what's going on to be able to understand why we aren't big fans of the effort in these parts.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:36:01
You get the forked coins, yes. As long as there is adequate replay protection (in the case of BCH and BTG and most other airdrops these days, there is) then you can spend coins on one chain but not the other. You are perfectly able to spend (and cash out) your BCH without spending your BTC in the process. I personally have done so with the majority of my own.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:30:24
Yeah, that matches my experience/percentage pretty well, too. To be fair, it has always sounded "too good to be true" and still does. Someone once said: "Bitcoin is the only thing that sounds too good to be true, and when you research it further, you realize it's *even better*." 
Well, they phrased it better than I did, but that was the gist of it, at least. That quote always stuck with me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:48:10


Nope, I already furnished the exact quotes. The words "exhibited the exact behavior" were not present in any of the quotes.
Please stop lying.


Note what I did and did not respond to. I quoted the specific phrase "No other network technology saw this kind of adoption behavior" and responded directly to that. The behavior of Bitcoin adoption is playing out very similarly to how the Internet was adopted.


It would work better if you would take a moment to acknowledge the argument that I've been repeating (four or five times at this point). The fact that you're **still** refusing to acknowledge the point shows that you are *either* a pathetic idiot *or* that you are purposefully trying to avoid it, in an attempt at misrepresentation and strawman-construction. Are you an idiot, or deliberately trying to be deceptive? There isn't a third possibility that I can see.
So, once again, and this time in bold so that it stands out: **saving in Bitcoin is using Bitcoin**. That's the argument. That's the entire point I've been making, since the very first comment. You keep trying to pretend like "no one is using Bitcoin" which shows that you haven't understood this simple point, and represents the fundamental reason why everything you have tried to argue is pathetic and idiotic. You say "People didn't start buying up fax machines and waited until everyone had a fax machine before they started using them" and I say "People didn't start buying up bitcoins and waited until everyone had a bitcoin balance before they started using them", because *buying bitcoins is using bitcoins*. Your argument is bunk, and even though I keep patiently explaining *exactly* why it is bunk, you just keep trying to avoid the explanation, thus digging yourself into a deeper and deeper pool of idiocy.
**Saving and investing in Bitcoin is using Bitcoin.**
Go ahead, ignore the point again. Dig yourself deeper into that hole.

Well of course the developers are capable of coding hard-forking changes (SegWit was originally coded as a hard fork, in fact, and it took some serious effort to make it backwards-compatible and soft-forkable instead).
Just for a moment you may want to try thinking about the "fee problem", as you call it, from another perspective. I know that this is a big challenge (and that's not meant to be a sleight or an insult, it's hard for *anyone* to adopt different perspectives from the ones they already have), but it can be a very valuable exercise if you're able to pull it off.
Eventually Bitcoin's security will be pretty much *totally* reliant on fees (and I don't mean in a hundred years, I mean in roughly a decade). Until this past year, there was significant doubt over whether this sort of economic model was actually sustainable, and whether Bitcoin could survive a transition from a subsidy/inflation-based paradigm to a fee-based one. Many prominent folks (Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jeff Garzik among them) argued that *no one would be willing to pay enough fees to sustain mining incentives*, and that Satoshi's original vision was broken and **would not work**. Hearn argued that we should use [assurance contracts]( to make sure Bitcoin survived in the long term (a *massive* deviation from Satoshi's plan), and strongly believed that if blocks ever became full (even temporarily), that Bitcoin would totally collapse, very quickly, and never recover.
This is **not** a strawman argument; this was what Hearn truly believed would happen (and both Andresen and Garzik echoed his beliefs on numerous occasions). Most of the developers in the space (and arguably most of the users, too) disagreed with this ultra-pessimistic perspective, and argued that we couldn't rush to such conclusions without more *actual* data about how well Bitcoin works in the presence of meaningful fee-pressure. In other words, the counterargument was "We need more data on the elasticity of blockspace demand before we can form strong opinions or conclusions on the subject." SegWit provided a best-of-both-worlds option, opening up transactional capacity and an "emergency relief valve" for the crowd that has been demanding these things, while also allowing us to gather *real empirical data* on how much of a priority the extra capacity is for the average transactor(s) and how an actual, free fee market affects the Bitcoin network and its operation.
What we seem to be seeing is that *the fee market does work!* Beyond that, we're seeing that the elasticity of blockspace demand is **nowhere near as high as Hearn, Andresen, and Garzik feared**... in fact, it seems exceptionally *in*elastic! Bitcoin has been chugging along just fine, prospering even, in a full-blocks context even as competitive fee-rates reach *unprecedented* levels. Rather than taking steps to reduce their fee-rates, most users and services are opting to just take the "lazy" route of "pay what it takes, don't bother with anything fancy"... this, too, comes as a surprise, and if nothing else it gives us valuable data to work with and inform our next steps.
This comment is getting a little long, but there is one more note worth mentioning: if fee pressure exists, it serves as an incentive to transact *responsibly* and *sustainably*, rather than wastefully. Businesses like Coinbase have been making *ridiculous* mistakes in terms of UTXO mismanagement, almost as bad as SatoshiDice's policy of spamming single-satoshi payments to notify bettors of their losses, and until recently there has been no real pressure to refrain from doing so. This has been increasing the burden on everyone else (i.e. it's a negative externality) in ways that could very well threaten Bitcoin's underlying value proposition in the long term. With an actual competitive free-market compelling users and services to behave more responsibly, it's possible that Bitcoin is being *saved*, in ways that most of us probably haven't even begun to consider. To sum this up, the long-term perspective looks *very* different from the short-term one, once you've thought it through.
To summarize, you argue that there's a "fee problem" and that it is worryingly "bad", but from another perspective (one which is not discussed by the masses so often, but is equally valid), this "fee problem" is anything *but* a problem. It's helping Bitcoin in a number of ways, it's providing us real and valuable hard data to consider, and it's indicating that Satoshi's vision might *actually* work in the long-term, contrary to the expectations of certain naysayers (who have been busy being proven exceptionally wrong for the past year and a half).
Again, I understand that it is hard to empathize with a perspective other than the one you've already adopted, but if you *do* take the time to earnestly reflect on these issues, you might find that your "fee problem" is more than it might seem at first glance.

Where did you get that idea? It's completely untrue...


Why would Blockstream stand to make any more money off of such networks than anyone else in the ecosystem?


This is also completely untrue... the blocksize was just increased a few months ago. That's why almost every single Bitcoin block these days is *larger* than 1MB.


Goodness, it sounds like you didn't get *anything* right. No offense, but you seem to be ridiculously misinformed... perhaps you're reading too much noise from conspiracy subreddits?

Maximum block *size* is 3.7MBish, though realistically we will rarely see blocks much larger than 2.2MB or so, even with SegWit being used by almost every Bitcoin user and transaction. 
But you're right that block size isn't really how Bitcoin's throughput is measured any more, block weight is. I was just responding to someone saying we needed to increase the "size" to point out that we just did so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:14:34
In other words, you are trying to argue that preserving or holding value is not a use-case of sound money.
Enough said.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:44
We haven't even come close to hitting our new limit, so obviously we do not "need it NOW".
Also, the end goal is *not* "bigger blocks" and never was. The end goal is "higher throughput without sacrificing or overly threatening the distinguishing value-add that Bitcoin offers to the world". And we are working on achieving exactly this.
How many lines of code have you contributed to Bitcoin (either the core protocol, or auxiliary codebases)? Have you helped in terms of peer review? Have you fleshed out the unit tests anywhere? Have you done anything other than try to stir up drama on Reddit (which, if it has any effect on development at all, *slows things down*)?
Seriously, I'm not trying to troll here. These are honest questions.


I remember not being that enthusiastic back in 2014 as so many merchants started "accepting BTC" (usually through Coinbase or BitPay, and usually configured to immediately cash out BTC payments into fiat as they came). It always seemed a little premature to be celebrating such illusory "victories"; sure, it got a headline or two (which helps "the Bitcoin narrative" marginally), but beyond that, it essentially ignores what Bitcoin is most suited for (even when fee-free transactions were being included all the time in the very next block). Everyone always seemed to expect this so-called "merchant adoption" to somehow help the price rise, but that would only hold true if they were *actually accepting Bitcoin*, not letting payment processors accept Bitcoin on their behalf and forward them dollars (or whatever other currency they *actually* accept).
Overstock stood out, because they actually legitimately accept Bitcoin (and have profited immensely by doing so). Byrne seems to genuinely "get it" in a way that most still don't.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy (or maybe more accurately nowadays, its childhood). There are big technological improvements and complements that are still in the very earliest stages of development. The price is *still* too low for it to function as a reasonably-stable currency yet (the volatility will remain too high until liquidity improves significantly), and that's coming from someone who believes we're due for a correction on the price front soon. It is the best monetary technology ever built (don't let the snake-oil salesmen convince you otherwise), but it has a ways to go before the end-user experience is smooth as butter.
That's all to say, don't sweat the news that "Steam stopped letting BitPay cash out bitcoins on their behalf" too much. It's honestly not even a bump in the road, in the grand scheme of things. In contrast, Lightning Network reaching release-candidate status... that *is* big news, and something to celebrate.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:26:02
The blocksize limit in Bitcoin was literally *just* increased significantly. Almost no blocks these days are *smaller* than 1MB any more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:08:55
It is 223 bytes, but since mid-August, blocksize limits (and transaction fee calculations) are not based on bytes, they are based on **weight units**. With SegWit, each byte of witness data is counted 1/4 as much as a byte of non-witness data.
The transaction will still be roughly the same size, but its *weight* will be lower if it is a proper SegWit transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:11


Bitcoin is still inflationary, if we're talking about the monetary supply. The price deflation it naturally exhibits is a result of the technology being adopted (i.e. demand exceeding available supply). Just like Apple's stock went up in value (enriching early holders of it) as the company achieved successes in the marketplace, so too do the value of bitcoins as the network achieves successes in the marketplace.


False. I don't dismiss "any criticism of Bitcoin" whatsoever, and this is a ridiculous strawman. I dismiss naive criticisms borne of ignorance, and explain precisely why they deserve to be dismissed as I do so.


Only when the criticism is from a person who doesn't understand Bitcoin, and I explain precisely what it is that they don't understand in the process.
In late 2013, one of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin was "There are only ever going to be 21 million coins, but there are 7 billion people! That's not enough coins to go around! Bitcoin is doomed!" I am not making this up; this was perhaps *the* most common criticism I encountered in the mainstream media's coverage of the subject.
I dismissed this criticism and explained that *Bitcoins are divisible* as I did so. In one swift comment, this demonstrated that the author(s) trying to criticize Bitcoin didn't understand what they were attempting to criticize, and explained what it was that they were missing. I am doing the same thing here, today, and you (like the authors of those articles) are digging your heels in and refusing to acknowledge the points that I'm making. 
It's fine, but don't pretend like you're making well-informed criticisms when you're not, and don't pretend like I'm dismissing things without explaining exactly why they deserve to be dismissed.


...except for the fact that I'm seriously responding to all these (naive) criticisms *in this very thread*, you mean?


Nope. See above.


Because I can explain, patiently, exactly why it is so. I have done so in this very thread, in fact, numerous times over.


That's why these newbies are making the criticisms in the first place, but not the reasoning used to debunk the criticisms.


True. You got this part right.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:12:39


Go for it.


...except for the facts.


There is not a disagreement of opinions here. There are facts and falsehoods.


I did.


A 5-week-old sockpuppet account? Yeah, not that big of a deal what it "looks like" to you.




It's the objective source of the Bitcoin consensus rules, and definitively shows that blocksizes can (and obviously in practice *do*) exceed 1MB in size without violating the consensus ruleset in place. I linked directly to the file, and **I even admitted that this was probably too intense of a source for the misinformant in question**.


What? No, I'm linking to the consensus.h file which shows how block**weight** limits work (and how the block*size* limit no longer exists). If you want to ask me further questions about how SegWit works, feel free.




Yes, that is quite obvious.


You'd be wrong in that expectation. The witness data [is very much still in the block]( it's simply serialized such that it can be stripped out selectively if the block is requested by a node identifying itself with a version number lower than 0.13.1. 
Your understanding is flawed. Review the link I just provided for a quick explanation on exactly how. It will take less than ten minutes to understand, if you really try.


Just did.


I do know how it works. I have just explained how it works. You are free to ask more questions if you still do not.

Presumably you made the story up to help perpetuate the narrative that "is censored and against free speech"... why you would want to do *that* is another question. One potential motive is profit, and considering the numerous cases where employees of Roger Ver were caught piloting sockpuppet accounts, politically censoring the discussion platforms he controls, spreading malicious and false propaganda, and most of all accusing others of doing that which they are guilty of... well, let's just say we can't exactly rule out some sort of direct compensation scheme here.
In other cases, misinformation might be spread as a result of (otherwise innocent) people being honestly fooled by *others* who have more sinister motivations, such that the bamboozled party winds up contributing to the falsehoods because they want to feel included in an "in-group" and they never took the time to step back and reflect on what they are doing and why.
Only you can definitively answer the question of why you would make up such accusations; I can guess, but that's about it.

Obviously these "problems" you speak of aren't that big of a priority to most users, if they aren't bothering to take advantage of the available solutions on the network!
That's one of the great things about SegWit: it really proved how much noise and fuss was being made about something that clearly isn't actually that big of a pain point!
The "hard fork at all costs" trolls hate this, of course, and do everything they can to avoid acknowledging it.

If you specifically go out of your way to craft "pathologically witness-intensive transactions" then you can get blocks up to 3.7MB in size. In actual, real-life usage, these will probably never occur; the type of transactions that achieve this are not reasonable to make with real money involved, they are the type of transactions that a computer programmer might make to "stress test" how big you can get a SegWit block to be if you're willing to throw bitcoins away during your stress testing. Someone broadcast a bunch of these transactions on Testnet a few months back, to do exactly this, and we saw a few 3.7MB blocks on there as a result. It's interesting from a theoretical perspective, but doesn't actually tell you much about how big blocks will ultimately be on mainnet when they're full of real SegWit transactions being made by real Bitcoin users.


It's because it allows the blocksize to be increased via a soft fork (as you correctly note), and because it slightly corrects an "incentive imbalance" concerning the UTXO set and the bloating thereof. To simplify somewhat: before the weight factor was introduced, it cost the same amount to make a transaction that creates a ton of little UTXOs (which have to be tracked and maintained -- ideally in memory, which is relatively expensive -- by all full nodes on the network) as it would cost to make a transaction that has less of an impact on the UTXO set. This meant that there was no real incentive to worry about the UTXOs you create (beyond the number of bytes that your transaction consists of). With the witness weighting, there's a subtle incentive to make transactions that are more "network friendly" and don't negatively impact the UTXO set in a way that burdens full nodes out there.


That's pretty much right, if by "transaction data" you mean "*base* transaction data" (i.e. the input address(es), destination address(es), and amount(s) transferred). This is the "who sent who how much" data; the witness data is the "proof that they are allowed to send that" part. 
An important note is that the witness data is *still serialized with the base data in the block*: see [this album]( for a good visualization laying it out. For all nodes running SegWit-aware code, the blocks contain this data just like always. It's just serialized in a way such that it *can* be stripped out selectively (see the diagrams linked above) in case an older node asks for the block, which means that the older node gets the base transaction data but not the "witness proofs" therein (which are pruned before the block is provided to them).
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:05
Way sooner than that (the release candidate is already out). The "18 months" meme is just something a bunch of trolls repeat to try to discredit the progress that's been made, because they're bitter that their coin is losing them massive amounts of money relative to just holding Bitcoin.
They have made a series of very poor judgments, and they try to distract themselves from this by parroting weird negative memes back and forth at each other. It's rather sad, actually.

It will probably be back up soon, unfortunately.
It's a bummer that Roger is squatting on such high-profile Bitcoin namespaces (e.g. the bitcoin dot com website), but fortunately he doesn't seem competent enough to leverage them in a strategically successful manner; his "we're the real Bitcoin" altcoin has been bleeding out for months now, dropping consistently in value relative to Bitcoin, and the decline has started to accelerate recently after Bitmain ran out of capital to prop it up.

Uh, your analysis was regarding **full blocks**, so I focused on them. It's not my fault that the only full blocks on BCH contain pathetic transaction counts...


Do you not understand what these laws represent? The entire point is to model and quantify the yield such protocol improvements can be expected to produce.
It seems like you might need to do quite a bit of reading before trying to do any calculations at all.


Understatement of the year, right here!


Don't cherrypick data, and you won't be accused of any such thing.


Again, I just went with *your* calculations (where *you* chose to focus on "completely full BCH blocks" and see where those calculations led). All I did was include the *other* full BCH blocks (rather than fixating exclusively on a single awkwardly-cherrypicked one). If you had gone with the ten or twenty biggest BCH blocks instead, the average would be **less than 1000 transactions per block**, so I was inadvertently doing you a *favor* by focusing only on the "full to the brim" blocks.
Finally, your original linked comment even seemed to conclude (even with your awkward cherrypicking *and* using Moore's Law rather than Nielsen's) that you probably would *not* be able to afford a node as things ramp up, but that it wasn't *inconceivable* that you might be able to. Now that someone has come along and pointed out the numerous flaws in your analysis, rather than taking these into consideration, you bristle with defensiveness and try to say "Well maybe we'll magically start outpacing Nielsen's Law, and what if we cherrypicked *even harder*, maybe that would help..."
Let's quit with the disingenuous and silly arguments. BCH can't reasonably remain decentralized, even with overoptimistic assumptions, much less with realistic ones. Of course, it's not decentralized *now*, so "remain decentralized" might even be a bit misleading when it comes to phrasing... but you get what I mean.
Regardless, Merry Christmas!

It sounds like you've still got a ways to go, my friend. Keep reading, keep learning, and most of all, keep *thinking*.
"A token for every use-case!" is basically the same as saying "Infinite networks, all without any network effect to speak of!"
The Internet is priceless, beyond price tags. And while int*ra*nets are valuable, too, they're not exactly something that gets your blood pumping. Imagine someone saying to you, "Okay, so the Internet is great and all, but imagine a miniature network that connects you with *your neighbors*, and no one else! Wouldn't that be awesome?"
You can use the Internet to connect with your neighbors pretty much just as well as you could use a local network to do so, via a forum or website dedicated to you and your neighborhood.

There has been some [interesting spam-like activity]( recently, seemingly as one component in a larger attack/campaign against Bitcoin.
These "spam" transactions (perhaps a better term would be "contrived transactions") basically massively inflate the competitive fee rates for next-block inclusion. The median rates that Bitcoin was *already* seeing, before this began, were quite high, and it's possible that this served as the metaphorical "straw breaking the camel's back" which made it generally unattractive to try to transfer coins at the (more common) lower-fee rates.
In other words, this contrived transaction traffic has managed to basically render the transfer of coins into a binary proposition: either spend **a lot** on fees, or don't bother trying to compete for fast confirmation at all. The chart/image here seems to depict this phenomenon pretty well.
Keep in mind, this is all my own interpretation of the subject. I could be wrong. We *are* seeing contrived traffic, but there might be another explanation I am not seeing or considering, and if anyone has a better idea of what this is showing, I'm interested to hear it.
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:42:14


Yes, I know, because otherwise you'd be able to respond to it. No one ever *does* bother to read the arguments and acknowledge the facts that they'd rather hide from. That's one of the reasons that BCH (and rbtc) are the laughing stock of the cryptoverse these days.


This is a lie. If you find any uncorroborated claims in my linked commentary, go ahead and highlight them directly. My claims are verifiable and sourced well.


No, I don't. In fact, that wouldn't make any sense, because *plenty of the comments I linked to were my own, made in rbtc, and I'm not a BCH shill*. This is another lie/misrepresentation.


No, and that's *another* strawman argument and misrepresentation. 
The price is *one* important metric that indicates adoption (or lack thereof, in the case of BCH), but far from the *only* one. Would you rather we focus on relative hashrate? What about code contributions (and number of contributors)? What about exponential scaling technology? Would you rather we talk about organic on-chain transaction volume?
Or are you just going to keep making strawman arguments so that you can ignore what I am *actually* saying?


Once again, you're just embarrassing yourself here. What I said was that *it sounds like* you don't have a coherent investment thesis (or any substantive reasoning at all, for that matter), and that was based upon the fact that the entirety of your "reasoning" (which is a generous phrasing to begin with) that you've exposed is the following: "I started reading in 2015 and started divesting from Bitcoin early 2016 because of the scaling debate." That indicates that you haven't done your research, and that you didn't have a reasonable understanding of Bitcoin's fundamentals to begin with. If you're changing your investment allocations based on trolls arguing on reddit, you didn't have a coherent investment thesis. I'm sorry if this hurts to hear, but it's the reality.
I knew more than enough to say what things seemed like, and in pointing out the vapidity of your perspective, I presented you with an easy opportunity to elaborate and explain that you *did* actually have a coherent investment thesis (if you actually did). Predictably, you didn't take the opportunity, and instead your response amounts to a couple of flimsy strawman arguments and a sad little "B-b-but... you... you don't know me!"
If you had solid reasoning, you could present it here. But I think we're both well aware that you won't (or can't) rise to such a challenge.


You're not really having a discussion, though, you see. You're desperately avoiding acknowledging every point I'm making, and then trying to rationalize your actions with lies. You admit that "I didn't read all your stuff" in your very first sentence.
You're not alone; pretty much the entire BCH community resorts to the same cowardice any time I point out the uncomfortable truths that you guys don't want to hear. This is an unmistakable (and very sad) pattern that your community exhibits.
What makes it particularly pathetic is that the pattern often goes like so:
1) Random BCH-supporter lies.
2) I civilly point out the lie.
3) Random BCH-supporter demands proof of my claim (and downvotes me).
4) I provide proof of my claim.
5) Random BCH-supporter tries to change the subject and/or refuses to look at the proof and/or lies some more and/or makes ad hominem attacks.
6) (optional): Random BCH-supporter calls in a brigade from the other BCH-supporters in order to get me even more downvoted; invariably none of them will address or acknowledge my proof or arguments, either.
This has happened over and over and over again. [Here's a perfect example of what I mean.]( It's like clockwork.


Right, you only come here when you're part of a brigade. That's a *huge* part of the problem, and demonstrates my primary point rather well, in fact. You're basically admitting here that you're not actually a member of the community, and instead just come here to pick fights (and apparently you, like your compatriots, don't have any particular affinity for honesty or critical thought).
It's not my fault that the facts paint an ugly portrait of you and your altcoin's community, and it's not my fault that you're too scared to look these facts head-on. 


I certainly will. If you ever change your mind and want to have a serious discussion (you know, where you actually read what I write instead of skipping it and deliberately trying to misrepresent me), you know where to find me.

Notice how the line crossed the 1MB a few months ago? You just proved my point. Heck, just load up [Blockchain.info's front page]( (or any other updated explorer) and look at the recent block sizes. As I said, pretty much every single one is bigger than 1MB.
Beyond that, the actual *limit* is **much** larger than the average block sizes we've been seeing. We have a bunch of excess capacity that's not being used; apparently most Bitcoin transactors (85-90%) are perfectly happy with the fee-rates seen recently, and are not in any rush to use the extra available capacity (and pay significantly lower fees by doing so).

It has almost nothing to do with the technology, and Bitcoin had zero-fees for the first 4-5 years of its existence, too.
Instead, the "cheap transactions" of most altcoins is mostly a function of their lack of demand (or in some cases lack of decentralization); think about it as if there were two restaurants, one of which served delicious and healthy food while the other served nasty food that not many people want to eat. Of course, the line of people waiting to get into the good restaurant is going to be long (and if it's a "pay to enter" policy, the fees people are paying to get in will be relatively high), whereas the line to get into the bad restaurant would be nonexistent and you could get in for free, at any time. That's basically what is happening here. And no matter how big the bad restaurant makes its building, it won't mean the food is any better (even if it hypothetically *could* fit more customers if any ever chose to go there).
Centralized systems can have cheap fees forever. Decentralized networks without significant levels of demand or usage can have cheap fees forever. Insecure decentralized networks can have cheap fees forever. Secure and decentralized networks with significant levels of demand or usage can have cheap fees forever if they also subsidize security through inflation perpetually.
Decentralized networks *with* significant levels of demand and usage which also have a finite supply cap *can* (in theory) have cheap fees without breaking their value proposition *if and only if* there are intelligently-engineered solutions augmenting their functionality to this end. Such solutions are being developed (and just now beginning to be used, in some cases), but this is not an overnight revolution, and it's important to remember how young the space still is. We're basically where the Internet was in 1996-1997, and while great things are being built, the Bitcoin equivalent to Google Maps and Netflix and Spotify aren't quite here yet.

Apparently it has been sufficient in achieving the largest (in absolute value) and longest price appreciation ever seen in Bitcoin, crypto, and arguably history.
What is "painfully obvious" to you might just be a personal opinion, and what's more, it might be a *minority* opinion.


Therein *does* lie the scaling bottleneck, at this point. Good observation. The finger of blame (when it comes to transaction backlogs and high fee rates) should be pointed at the major players who have been stonewalling progress, like Coinbase and Blockchain.info/com. These companies have hypocritically proclaimed network "congestion" (that is to say, blockspace demand continually in excess of supply) as a problem, and then gone on to *deliberately exacerbate* the issue in a number of ways; they backed a contentious fork which required considerable developer attention (over the course of multiple months of what otherwise might have been productive development) in order to protect against, only to back out shortly prior to the fork block height (which it turned out had been hilariously poorly programmed in the first place); they have been failing (refusing) to optimize in terms of transaction batching, sane fee-estimations and algorithms, and other efficient transactor behavior; they have (after pretending readiness and having years of lead time to render these pretenses realities) awkwardly refrained from taking advantage of the recent capacity increase, and they have utterly failed to dedicate any significant resources of any kind towards furthering or bettering the network which is their lifeblood.
It is shameful, and there's no way to pretend otherwise.


I could have *sworn* a capacity increase was lauded as "desirable" all this time. But hey, you are free to disagree.


You misunderstand. Plenty of non-engineers have relevant things to say, but *pretending that certain trade-offs don't exist is a waste of time*, and *failing to actually work on the problems and take responsibility where appropriate* is pretty much the only issue that seems to really be occurring on this front, and as far as I can see, the engineers are the one group of stakeholders who *are* consistently helping, contributing, and taking responsibility on this stuff. 
First the miners delayed a blocksize increase for *a year*, before finally caving to the pressure of a UASF threat. Now middlemen like Coinbase are delaying that same blocksize increase from achieving its potential.


When redditors make up fantasies like this, it makes them sound silly.


More fantasies...


A lot of people (*not* just developers) argued that a blocksize/capacity increase wasn't really a priority. One of the advantages to performing an *opt-in* capacity increase (like SegWit) is that it allows us to actually see how much of a priority it is considered to be. Judging from Coinbase's foot-dragging, those people are having their arguments vindicated right now. And here you are, trying to have your cake and eat it, too, without a hint of self-awareness to go down with it.

It's not "late", but yes, it's in alpha right now. Complex technologies that manage capital (in a "no take backs" context like Bitcoin) should be tested extensively before having money funneled into or through them.
Running on mainnet means that you can use it. Like SegWit, the Lightning Network is opt-in, meaning that it is not forced on anyone, and people can decide to use (or not use) it for themselves. This is a good thing.

Lightning Network is a layer *on top* of Bitcoin, using multisignature Bitcoin transactions itself. It doesn't require any new miners in any way, because underneath it all, it's using Bitcoin transactions.
Think of it like how an HTML page is delivered over the TCP/IP protocol. The HTML content delivery doesn't require a new protocol alongside TCP/IP, it sits *on top* of TCP/IP. In this analogy, Bitcoin is TCP/IP and the World Wide Web (consisting of HTML pages) is the Lightning Network.

There was, until a blocksize increase proposal was made that boasted a number of advantages over all the others, including backwards-compatibility, an opt-in malleability fix, smart contract and script versioning improvements, a gradual and free-market-based uptake path (allowing elasticity metrics to be gathered), incentive-based UTXO bloat mitigation, and linear sigop scaling.
For obvious reasons, this got community support (even consensus) fairly quickly. No one in Core "vetoed" it, even though it *does* represent a significant blocksize limit increase.
After some kerfluffle with a certain mining empire trying desperately to preserve their covert ASICBOOST advantage, the proposal was activated on mainnet, lifting the limit well past the old 1MB figure. Nowadays, almost *no* blocks are smaller than 1MB any more (excepting the empty/empty-ish ones).
Like I said, interesting fantasy you have there. Might want to look into how reality is going every now and then, though.

If we're talking about the "average expected blocksize with full SegWit usage" then 1.8MB is a reasonable estimate. If we're talking about the "consensus limit" then it's around 3.7MB (to be precise, it is 4M weight units).

This is false. By your definition of "works better as a coin", a VISA credit card works better as a coin than *any* cryptocurrency. Can't beat those cash back reward points et al.
Bitcoin is currently the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency that exists. Is it Turing expressive? No, and for good reason; that would expand the attack surface immeasurably, and at-the-edge computation is fundamentally more efficient and economically sound than mandatory-and-redundant computation. Does it have a dynamic or memory-hard hashing algorithm? No, and for good reason; this doesn't actually prevent mining specialization, it just complicates it and delevels the playing field even worse, long-term. Does it have the lowest fees on-chain? No, because there is actual demand for the necessarily-scarce resource of blockspace (i.e. transaction inclusion or confirmation). Is it easy to rewrite or replace the consensus rules? No, and *that is why it is so valuable*.
You're very new here, so you haven't had time to learn about the fundamentals, and meanwhile, since we're in the peak of a hype cycle, every altcoin has a fancy sales brochure that their marketing department has been polishing for the past year or two, and you're unfortunately not knowledgeable enough (yet) to tell the "shit from shinola", as Terence McKenna would say.
You seem to be worrying about transaction fees, as if high fees are a *bad* thing for the prospects of Bitcoin's long-term growth, but that's a backwards perspective if you're evaluating it as an investment opportunity. Ask yourself: *why are people still paying those Bitcoin fees, even when they get so high?* Then ask yourself: *what does that imply about Bitcoin's underlying value?*
Decentralized paradigms are messy and confusing, because most of the things you're used to are very centralized (and thus more understandable). You might think that "oh look, altcoin XYZ has hard forked successfully a dozen times this year, and Bitcoin hasn't even managed to hard fork *once*, so that must mean it's better and more upgraded!" but this actually indicates that altcoin XYZ is *not actually decentralized, and not actually immutable*, which means that fundamentally, it's *not actually valuable in any long-term sense* (at least not yet).
Counterintuitive? Absolutely! But counterintuitive (yet valid) conclusions are the norm around these parts. They are Bitcoin's bread and butter.


Forks of Bitcoin are *not* Bitcoin, so they don't "make more Bitcoin", they just copy it (and generally "airdrop" their coins to Bitcoin holders, like a stock dividend). Bitcoin will still only ever have 21M real coins (at most), no matter how many forks spin off from it. And in fact, each fork makes us holders (who are holding the *real* Bitcoin) a little bit richer, because we get the forkcoins for free. This (again counterintuitively) reinforces the real Bitcoin's network effect.

The BCH authorities have specifically stated that their explicit goal is to **never** have full blocks, and to ensure the blocksize is **always** increased to ensure this happens. This *is* their roadmap.
It's better to actually try and *learn* rather than *assume*, and it is shameful to go around spreading misinformation when you don't actually know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:03
They don't have to own a big portion of the mining resources *or* come to an agreement, actually.
They just have to make and prioritize their own high-fee transactions. Since they're the ones collecting the fees, it doesn't cost them anything to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:25:42
The blocksize limit in the real Bitcoin was increased just a few months ago (that's why almost every block these days is larger than 1MB). So yes, it is possible.
What these other coins (like Cash, Diamond, Gold, and B2X) are doing is launching "airdrop altcoins" (there's an entire subreddit dedicated to these things: because it is a very low-effort way of gaming the "market cap" metric and making an altcoin seem much bigger and more important than it really is.
In order to upgrade the consensus rules of the *real* Bitcoin (in a backwards-incompatible way), you have to convince all the other Bitcoin users to adopt your change, which means your change will have to be an *obvious* improvement to the existing rules. So far, no one has come up with such a change or upgrade, so instead, they are launching altcoins and trying to market them rather than technically improving on the codebase.
Incidentally, increasing the blocksize does the *opposite* of "easing the workload"; it actually would *increase* the workload of each node on the network (inevitably forcing some to shut down because things get too expensive). That is a big reason why so many of us Bitcoiners don't want to do it. It is a "dumb" way to try to scale, and we have *actual* (smart) solutions being developed that keep things lightweight and efficient while *also* providing the possibility of instant and extremely-cheap transactions to those who want these things.
Finally, the "cheap transactions" of most altcoins (like those airdrop coins) is mostly a function of their lack of demand (or in some cases lack of decentralization); think about it as if there were two restaurants, one of which served delicious and healthy food while the other served nasty food that not many people want to eat. Of course, the line of people waiting to get into the good restaurant is going to be long (and if it's a "pay to enter" policy, the fees people are paying to get in will be relatively high), whereas the line to get into the bad restaurant would be nonexistent and you could get in for free, at any time. That's basically what is happening here. And no matter how big the bad restaurant makes its building, it won't mean the food is any better (even if it hypothetically *could* fit more customers if any ever chose to go there).

I'd advise putting a *tiny* bit in whenever you next have the opportunity (like $10). You don't want to get in the habit of "waiting for the drop" (even if you're sure it's coming) because the next thing you know, Bitcoin could double in price a few more times and you're sitting there mad at it.
I'm an advocate for "trickling in and out", or to use a more professional phrase, *dollar cost averaging* and taking your profits gradually when your price targets start to get hit. The biggest and most difficult thing about holding or investing in Bitcoin is the emotional factor... it's much harder to be logical and unemotional about it than it seems, and no matter how confidently you have it figured out, it has a way of making you doubt yourself when things get rough (or weird). So if you're just putting in tiny chunks of change every now and then, and maybe amping up your buy amount a little bit when the price falls noticeably, it helps to keep yourself in psychological check.
But it's completely up to you. Maybe waiting for The Big Drop is a better or more profitable strategy. I couldn't tell you for sure.

Not if you prune them off before sending to any client identifying with a version older than 0.13.1... which is exactly what you do.
Because of the way that [SegWit transactions are serialized]( this is possible. Note, however, that the witness bytes are still very much in the block (and in the transactions). They are simply serialized such that they can be selectively pruned if desired (e.g. if relaying a block to an older node).


False. It seems like you didn't understand what you just quoted. The blocksize limit was removed, and replaced with a (less restrictive) *weight* limit. That is how there are so many [blocks bigger than 1MB these days](

That's like saying "99% of people are only driving automobiles and only a very small amount are using them at all."
Investing in Bitcoin **is** using it. In fact, it's one of its primary use cases at this stage (the only significant other one that springs to mind being transacting remotely in situations that would otherwise be censored by traditional remote payment networks or platforms).
Anyone who says "You aren't *using* Bitcoin if you're holding it" doesn't know what they're talking about. Saving in Bitcoin (i.e. "speculating" or "investing" in it) is the most rational use-case that currently exists. It *is* modern sound money, after all.

If I flood your network connection with too many packets for you to successfully establish connections to other sites and services, that's an example of a *denial of service attack*. It is annoying and troublesome (just like spam is), but it prevents you from doing other things, too.
Furthermore, the blocksize does *more* than just prevent DoS attacks. It also makes Bitcoin economically viable over the long term (by helping to ensure that a transaction backlog can occur, which is necessary for Bitcoin to survive a transition from a block-subsidy paradigm to a transaction-fee one).

It does not appear that you have understood the paragraph, in that case.
You assume that the introduction of complexity is an advancement, and this is the assumption that you should be questioning. It is not (solely) a matter of marginal risk, it is a matter of trade-offs and deoptimization.
Think of it this way: you can model simple arithmetical operations as incredibly-complex mathematical expressions, but that doesn't make the complex versions any *better* (or "more advanced") from a functional standpoint.
If I asked you for "ζ(3)^(e^iπ + 1) apples"  would you consider my request "more technologically advanced" than me simply saying "Can I have an apple?" Of course not.
"Complexity" is *not* synonymous with "superiority" and this is one of those lessons that will take a lot of people a *long* time to learn (assuming they ever do). And if you make the trade-off to sacrifice decentralizability and/or economic viability in favor of complexity (as many coins most certainly do), you cannot reasonably claim that the coin has tech which is "more advanced" than Bitcoin's own.
Consider the possibility that you may be unwittingly parroting sales brochures on this point. Bitcoin's architecture is how it is for *very* good reason.

They're so careful not to say "Bitcoin" in their recent statements. It's downright embarrassing at this point, especially because in certain contexts (like this one) it results in subtly misleading statements. We've recently seen unprecedented rises in *Bitcoin's* price, but not in *digital currencies' prices in general*. It's silly to try to lump things together in cases where this results in awkward and slightly-misleading messages, and yet that's exactly what was done here.

Actually, it sounds like you're not terribly familiar with how the Internet's infrastructure grew and unfolded. That did happen, a number of times.


No. Metcalfe's Law concerns networks' utility/value as a function of the number of connections that network has. Bitcoin is a network. Metcalfe's Law seems appropriate and relevant, at least until you offer an actual argument for why it should not be.

Interestingly, the two questions you have asked (and their underlying assumptions) directly contradict one another. The former question implies that rational users would very rarely close lightning channels, meaning that "on-chain settlement transactions" would be relatively rare, which would theoretically result in sufficient available space in blocks to facilitate low on-chain fees. The latter question seems to assume the exact opposite eventuality.


That's one of the biggest and most obvious ones, yes, but not the *only* incentive. If you'd like to store your coins as securely as possible (i.e. cold storage) or save them for a long period of time, then taking them out of a hot wallet or lightning channel is the best way to go. If you want to pay someone who doesn't have a lightning channel set up (and doesn't want one), that's that. If you'd like to set up some sort of non-lightning smart contract with your bitcoins (e.g. a long-term timelocked arrangement of some sort) then you'd close any lightning channels they're in. As someone else already mentioned, if you want to include an OP_RETURN message of some sort to your transaction, that's another reason to post things on-chain.
In short, even in a world where the Lightning Network is running smoothly on all fronts, there are plenty of use cases outside of those that payment channels are optimized for.


No, I don't see any reason why that should be the case, and honestly don't understand the logic that would lead to the question in the first place. If anything, a well-functioning and widely-used Lightning Network would massively reduce the average fees needed to make a transaction (whether on-chain or off).

Satoshi was in favor of phasing in larger blocks once the network **needed** it, but he adamantly opposed every single attempt to do so while he was still around. He was one of the most fervent small-blockers that Bitcoin has ever seen, in fact (most likely because he had spent a lot of time thinking about how Bitcoin could handle large scale volumes without losing its decentralization).
As just a few examples of Satoshi's writings on the subject of scaling and upgrading Bitcoin...
Satoshi said ["Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale."](
He said ["BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices."]( He said this *in support* of these "increasingly tyrannical" Bitcoin users, as you can see.
He *consistently* [rejected and adamantly opposed every attempt to try and hard-fork the 1MB cap upwards]( siding with theymos and *against* Jeff Garzik. He was a vocal advocate of [soft forks to upgrade Bitcoin]( and was  [staunchly opposed]( to [out-of-consensus Bitcoin implementations]( He believed that [any hypothetical hard forks should *only* be performed with long lead times and with extreme precautions taken to ensure that the changes are uncontroversial, **needed**, and safely adopted by the full network before being activated]( preemptively agreeing with almost every modern Bitcoin developer on the issue. 
He spent **over 10%** of the [original whitepaper]( (an entire page worth of text, 2 out of 12 sections) towards the reclamation of disk space and SPV, clearly having spent a lot of time thinking about the scalability tradeoffs that Bitcoin has to make in order to be truly decentralized.
He [described payment channel implementations]( and [explained how they could be used to facilitate high-frequency trading (which would otherwise not be possible with Bitcoin's design)](
Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, he designed Bitcoin from the very beginning so that it could be upgraded via "soft forks". He specifically said that [he worked very hard to make sure transaction version upgrades could be soft forked](  and one example of such a soft fork (a transaction upgrade and blocksize increase) was *SegWit*, which was activated on the Bitcoin network on August 1. The biggest benefit of soft forks is that since they make sure all the old rules of the network are valid, everyone stays on the same chain and the Bitcoin network remains unified. *This* is the type of upgrade that Satoshi most strongly advocated, and the only type that he ever actually implemented himself.
Almost no one thinks that "larger blocks are a 'corporate takeover'" but almost everyone with an engineering background or understanding of scaling distributed networks *does* understand that there are tradeoffs to simply increasing the blocksize, which is why so many advocate for making things more *optimized* or *efficient* (and perhaps leveraging tiered networks and platforms on top of the base layer to batch many transactions together) before going crazy with the blocksize increases.
**We just increased the maximum blocksize -- we more than doubled it! That's what SegWit did.** Now we're busy taking advantage of this increase before figuring out if we need *another* one.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:12:46
No, that is false (it's an unfortunate myth). SegWit increases the blocksize. SegWit transactions are actually slightly *bigger*, on average, than legacy-style transactions. The only way that more can fit in a block is via the block being bigger.
[Check out all these Bitcoin blocks bigger than 1MB.]( These are possible because of SegWit.
It's also a myth that SegWit moves the witness data "off the blockchain"; all the data is still in the blocks, it's just serialized in a clever way where the witness data can be stripped when communicating a block to an older node.

Your previous comment asserted that "nobody except a small group of people can author proposed changes" and "this small group has power over what network participants can and cannot implement" and "they get to decide what this bitcoin society can vote for"... all of these statements are false, and I explained exactly how.

Lightning Network maximizes the *base* layer's decentralization potential.
Furthermore, Lightning Network (massively) lowers the barriers to entry on the second layer, which is currently occupied by companies like Coinbase. Finally, it means that second-layer payment processors no longer need to have custody of users' private keys or funds, so it minimizes (virtually eliminates) trustiness on the second layer.
It is strictly an improvement from the status quo.

Speaking personally, I think making comments about how much and when you're cashing out *in the Daily Discussion thread* is perfectly fine, and helps to keep the front page a little bit more interesting while still giving people the chance to discuss their actions and decisions.

This *is* true, and no, it does not mean that there would be a new "first place" coin every day, because that's not the direction that the incentives point towards. Spend 10 seconds thinking this through, and it will click.
Imagine you have an idea for an altcoin. What is it that you're after? Almost invariably, it's profits, which come from other people buying your coin from you. You *could* game the market cap metric so badly that it is blatant even to the most clueless newbie that your figure is fake (a $20 trillion market cap is trivially achievable, and for the record, I have actually already created an ERC-20 token with such a "market cap" for laughs, but I haven't bothered contacting CoinMarketCap about listing it), or alternatively, you could game the metric a little bit less ridiculously (e.g. make it have a market cap of $40-100M or so), so that sites like CoinMarketCap don't think twice about throwing it in their giant list of coins when it comes on their radar. Which strategy seems more profitable to you?
When it comes to stuff like this, *think it through*. Put yourself in the shoes of someone launching their own coin and gaming the metric. Don't just think "Oh it's impossible, otherwise we'd be seeing it done all the time" because _we **are** seeing it done all the time_, you just don't seem to have noticed.

Sort of, yeah.
But with Bitcoin, many of us logically *deduced* that the risk-to-reward ratio was (and very arguably still is) the single best such ratio/opportunity that we've ever encountered. We argued about it, we spent months convincing ourselves that we weren't missing or overlooking some hidden "gotcha", and then we invested accordingly. We did our best to extrapolate what would most likely happen, and we put our money where our mouth was, and seeing ourselves proven right has been an enjoyable experience.
When newcomers waltz in and try to dismiss the research and critical thought that we put in (not to mention the actual dollars) as if we just "got lucky" it's more than a little irritating.
Nobody can *perfectly* predict the future. You *can* make a **very** educated guess, though, and profit from it if you're right.

A transaction backlog is not a problem, *period*. It is a sign that Bitcoin is working.
If a backlog *didn't* exist, that would be worrying, because it would mean that later on, as the block subsidy drops, we might have to worry about mining incentives and network stability.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:45:10
Almost all altcoins *do* game the metric like this; it's in their best interests to do so, because for whatever reason, some people still seem to think the metric is significant.

It's an argument in favor of *decentralized, cryptographically-secure sound money*; so far, no other cryptocurrency has even come close to challenging Bitcoin in terms of utility in this capacity.
Unfortunately, the level of knowledge required to fully understand how technically optimized Bitcoin is for this purpose is incredibly high. Very few people seem to realize this fact, and the vast majority seem to be under the (quite demonstrably mistaken) impression that particular other cryptocurrencies are technically superior (or "more useful") than Bitcoin as a sound electronic money. Even more unfortunately, in most cases where someone who *does* know what they're talking about spends the time to try to educate someone who does *not*, the person on the wrong side of the knowledge differential feels condescended towards or patronized, and rather than taking advantage of the learning opportunity, they will usually respond defensively and with growing hostility.
Ignorance begets ignorance.

Well, you're quoting a 2-year old estimate when we have newer (higher and more accurate) estimates generated since. 2-2.4MB is the more accurate figure with majority SegWit usage. The 1.7MB figure is mostly quoted by Bitcoin antagonists who are purposefully trying to choose the most pessimistic (and at this point misleading) estimate possible.

If you had an insane amount of BTC in 2010, that's awesome. I'm not saying that no one did. Obviously some did.
But two questions:
1) Why should *you* be begging *me* for payment, in that case? It seems like it would make more sense the other way around...
2) The only way to really prove you had such holdings back then is to sign a message with the private key to an address that held "an insane amount of BTC" at the time, and either *still does* or *is accompanied by signatures from another address that they were transferred to*. Otherwise, you could have just bought/acquired old (but now empty) private keys for signing purposes, which doesn't actually prove much. And again, if you have such holdings, see question 1!
Not that I'm doubting you. Just questioning your logic.

There are already a few mainnet channels open (e.g. [yalls has one]( so it's technically already working and "activated", but for now, most implementations (e.g. eclair, lnd, and c-lightning) are configured by default to run on testnet, and so you would have to make a minor tweak to the source code and recompile in order to use them on mainnet.
The developers of these implementations are not exactly encouraging people to go and do this (even though it's possible)... to be more concrete, they're mostly actively *discouraging* such experimentation, because mainnet means real money is on the line, so bugs and unexpected behavior might actually cost people capital. So it's very much in the "use at your own risk" stage right now, and it's probably not a good idea to go out of your way to start trying to use it just yet.

Litecoin is a fork, too. Is Litecoin Bitcoin? Obviously not.
**An airdrop is an airdrop.**
Altcoins like BCH and CLAMS and LTC are not Bitcoin. I'm sorry, this is a fact, not an opinion.


On a protocol level, Litecoin more closely resembles Bitcoin than BCH. Litecoin is an altcoin, though.


It's not clear that you do, since you seem to be arguing (or at least implying) that Bitcoin is no longer electronic cash while BCH somehow is. This is simply wrong.


Bitcoin has transaction fees, and they are *strictly necessary* for it to work over the long-term. If you aren't comfortable with transaction fees, that doesn't mean "Bitcoin isn't electronic cash" in any way. That says far more about you than it does about Bitcoin.


No, both are equally usable as electronic cash, because transaction fees have *absolutely nothing to do with that term*. Again, this is a fact. I am sorry if you don't like it, but that (again) says more about you than about Bitcoin.


I'm using "trust" here in the sense that it was used in the Bitcoin whitepaper (e.g. in the phrase "trusted third party").


To be clear: it's something to worry about, but it's not the whole picture. If no one were able to run full nodes *except* the miners, *that* would be truly scary.
Sure, a fully centralized mining situation is not something we want. We should do everything we can to mitigate and protect against it. My point was that "we need to worry about more than just the mining function being centralized", though I admit that I communicated this exceptionally poorly. Good spot, and quality response on this front.


SegWit, for one.


Did I? Mind quoting me on that one? I honestly don't remember typing anything even *close* to that. Maybe I blacked out or something, but I can't seem to find such a quote even now. Surely you're not just strawmanning, though, right?


Heh... let's be clear here: **Bitcoin has the big blocks**, the average blocksize is probably a little over 1MB these days. In contrast, BCH blocks average something like 60Kb.
To the best of my knowledge, not a single Bitcoin Core contributor has *ever* argued that "a single 8MB block would break or catastrophically centralize Bitcoin" or anything even remotely resembling such a statement.
It seems that you are under the impression that this is the opposition you are arguing against. If so, it's no wonder you disagree with it so vehemently. I would, too.
I have a sincere question that I would appreciate an honest answer to: how much time and effort have you spent *actually* trying to understand the positions and perspectives of the few dozen most prolific contributors to Bitcoin Core? Are you confident that you could summarize most of their arguments (and the nuances thereof) reasonably well? Finally, are you aware that *most of them essentially don't even use Reddit or Twitter*?

In Bitcoin, every transaction in a block **except for one** has to reference already-existing coins. That one transaction which doesn't have to reference preexisting coins is known as the "coinbase transaction" and it basically allows the miner of the block to assign *new coins* that previously did not exist to a particular address (the "coinbase address") which the miner gets to specify.
Since the miner will only use a coinbase address that they have the private key to, they will be able to spend these new coins later on (after 100 blocks go by and the new coins have "matured").
The number of coins rewarded in the coinbase transaction is currently 12.5; it started at 50, and every 4 years it gets cut in half. If a miner tries to award themselves more coins than the currently-allowed amount, their block is considered invalid by other miners, and just gets ignored.
The miners are not "brute forcing private keys", but they are brute forcing the SHA-256 hash function to try and find an output that begins with a set number of "0"s (the exact number of which is determined by the current mining difficulty). Since the outputs of good hash functions are not predictable in advance, the only way to find an input which grants you the required number of leading 0s is to "guess and check" and if you happen to guess correctly, you have a block that can be considered valid to the rest of the network (which you broadcast immediately, so that you can claim those coinbase coins).
Note: "coinbase" in the context above has nothing to do with Coinbase, the company. They named themselves after the Bitcoin protocol term.

Interesting note: since Coinbase was (and likely still is) generally overpaying in terms of fees, they would also be inadvertently tricking a lot of wallet software out there into "high fee feedback loops", which someone demonstrated a few months ago has been a huge factor in the size of fees we have been seeing in Bitcoin.

...or if you actually added a new wing to the house, replete with spacious new rooms that guests could stay in. Which is a more appropriate analogy in the case of SegWit.
Of course, guests don't *have* to stay in the new wing. It's there if they want to, though, and it costs less to stay in, too (because it uses fancy technology to automatically clean up after the guests, so as the homeowner you can save on maid costs).
A surprisingly fitting analogy!
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:02:53
Not quite correct. Ethereum has Turing-complete *expressiveness* but is not functionally Turing-complete because of gas bounds, which are extremely restrictive in practice.
Bitcoin is also a smart contract platform, but because ultimately the "interesting" portion of a smart contract is usually the interface between physical reality and the blockchain (i.e. the oracle component), Bitcoin can handle most useful or practical smart contract use cases with relatively-simple multisignature setups (allowing the oracle(s) to be one or more of the signatories).
Ethereum does facilitate application development that vanilla Bitcoin does not support; CryptoKitties is an excellent example of such an app.

Nope, now you're just lying. What you **actually** said was this: "No other network technology saw this kind of adoption behavior." I said: "Sure they did."
My primary point, which I've repeated many times by now (and which you staunchly refuse to acknowledge) is that **saving in Bitcoin is using Bitcoin**, because Bitcoin is *money*, and one of the [functions of money is to be a "store of value"](
You (conspicuously) keep trying to avoid looking this fact head-on, and seem more interested in parroting fallacies and misrepresentations than anything else.




No, it's a strawman to pretend like I said "People aren't using Bitcoin" when my entire point has been that *people investing in and saving in Bitcoin are using it*, which you continually refuse to acknowledge, betraying a deep and severe misunderstanding that you are adamantly clinging to in the face of someone better-informed trying politely to educate you.
You build a strawman, I tell you it's a strawman (and why it is such), you double-down on the misrepresentations. For shame.


It was made for *telecommunications networks*. Fax machines and phones are just two examples of such networks. Bitcoin is another.


You can't, and shouldn't. You can draw reasonable parallels to compare the two, but if you expect them to map over to one another perfectly in every single respect, you're going to be sorely disappointed. When you go out of your way to *try* to find differences between the two, and then you trot out those differences as if it somehow proves that they cannot *also* share similarities, you're just making a fool of yourself.


This is also true. You can compare *and* contrast different technologies, but if you are hoping for terms that predate new technologies to perfectly encompass every aspect and possibility that those technologies bring to the table, you're (again) going to be sorely disappointed.
Both Bitcoin and fax machines allow people to communicate with one another over communication media. Fax machines do not have a finite supply of tokens or coins powering them, though. Look, a similarity *and* a difference, both off the top of my head!
If you come around and say "Look, fax machines don't use coins, therefore Bitcoin cannot be adopted like fax machines were!" then you just sound like an idiot, and more rational people (such as yours truly) will have an easy time demonstrating exactly *why* you sound like an idiot. When you then go on to try and argue against those rational respondents, doubling down on your false premises, it digs you deeper and deeper into a hole of shame. When, in a fit of desperation, you wind up building strawmen while you're in that hole, it just makes you look completely pathetic to anyone who cares to glance your way.
Look, it's clear that you're not actually trying to learn anything here, and that you're just upset and letting your emotions run wild. There's not much value to be had from continuing this discussion, and you're just making it worse on yourself every time you try. It might be time to say our goodbyes and part ways, bud.

That's not the question at all. That's an opinion masquerading (poorly) as a question. It's the same as if someone said "The question is why you are so stupid"; it's a thinly-veiled insult and nothing more.


Again, what you're trying to paint as a "failure" is the most successful cryptocurrency in the world. I see no failure. You keep trying to pretend there's a failure, but this is an opinion and not a fact. An uninformed opinion, no less.
You can interpret that as "snark" if you want (as I am sure you will), but it's actually an insight. A humble and well-intentioned person would reflect on it rather than taking it personally, and grow for the reflection.


Neither do I. I will, of course, honestly appraise those forks and implementations as they come, but I have no "problem" with them and have actually personally profited immensely from the existence of a number of them.


You have strong opinions that there is a failure in the first place; opinions that a more well-informed person (or a more talented critical thinker) would question.


By programming and thoroughly testing a blocksize cap and capacity increase, and making sure it was deployed as safely and intelligently as possible? By honestly appraising the trade-offs involved? 
The original "WE MUST HARD FORK" proposal involved an immediate fork to 20MB blocksize limit that rapidly increased to *giga*byte limits over time. Some Core developers suggested a hard fork to 2MB instead, increasing over time to a 4/8MB limit (this was before SegWit was proposed as an alternative way to increase capacity), and asked Gavin whether he would like to help work and collaborate on such a design. Gavin outright refused, saying "2MB is pathetically small, and I'm not willing to even consider such a compromise", and this was *back in mid-2015*. Adam Back politely asked him to reconsider, and suggested that an open panel be called so that they could work some sort of agreeable consensus out, and Gavin stopped responding and started ignoring such requests altogether.
Shortly afterwards, a paper was published which demonstrated that (at the time), limits greater than 8MB would be demonstrably destructive for the network in a number of ways. In other words, Gavin's original proposal (which he was adamantly opposed to reconsidering) was demonstrated to be a *fundamentally* terrible idea. Finally, he decided to drop the proposal's relevant limit figures, but at that point the developers who *were* interested in finding an agreeable consensus-based path forward had already discovered and begun building and testing a superior approach which *had* managed to achieve widespread consensus (on account of it properly taking into account the relevant trade-offs as well as providing numerous other benefits for long-term scalability solutions).
Furthermore, a little known fact about the "hard fork at all costs" method was that it was *known* to diverge massively from Satoshi's envisioned Bitcoin maturation plan (and the social contract that was already in place and agreed upon); the alternative plan that was supposed to replace it was a far-fetched [assurance contracts]( approach, for which there *was not* and still *is not* anything remotely resembling widespread agreement or consensus. Most people didn't even realize that this was part of Gavin and Mike's long-term strategy, because most people weren't really paying that much attention. Oh, and by the way, part of the plan was to install Mike Hearn as the """benevolent""" dictator of the codebase (another proposal for which there was *not* widespread support).
So a broken idea involving a radical deviation from the original Bitcoin formula (not to mention a total departure from decentralization) was rejected by the wider developer community, who later had their objections vindicated by further study. Great. 
After an unsavory rage-quit by Hearn (again vindicating the rejection of the XT approach and its inherent installation of him as King of Bitcoin), *another* bad proposal rose up to take its place, this time headed by a couple of brothers who didn't really have any development expertise, but figured "Hey we can change a 1 to a 2, and after that, who cares, we'll figure stuff out as we go!" Again, this didn't really seem like a good idea to most critical thinkers in the space (including but *not limited to* most experienced developers in the community), and it lost all momentum once one of those two brothers tripped a bunch of acid and made a fool of himself by trolling certain Slack channels publicly. Again, the rejection of this idea seems to have been well vindicated.
Then *another* bad proposal surfaced, this time involving "no limit at all!" This was demonstrated to be fundamentally broken in a number of ways, but that's not really what put the nail in the Unlimited coffin (though it certainly should have). What did it was a total loss of credibility as the "developer"s of the implementation made a shockingly large number of rookie mistakes in their code, breaking components left and right and causing massive node outages on a regular basis. They then tried to cover these mistakes up with outright lies and deception, but the credibility damage was done, and over time the market slapped down their bad code for what it was, and *yet again* the developers (and other users) who had criticized and rejected the bad proposal had their criticisms and rejection vindicated in a big way.
Finally, a bunch of businesses got together (behind closed doors and without consulting any developers nor the wider community) and said "Let's just bundle in SegWit with a hard-fork, whether or not we can get any competent developers to support the hard-fork half of things." As this *once again* tried to bypass the existing consensus process and *once again* represented an attempt at imposing a top-down, command-and-control power structure installation onto a decentralized network, this, too, was met with objections from the existing developer (and user) communities. Later, *yet again*, these objections were vindicated, as the hard-fork component of the code flopped horrendously, failing to activate *not only* due to lack of actual support but *also* due to a junior-level off-by-one bug (that would have been caught had any serious testing ever been performed).
Are you noticing the pattern here? Everything I've said above is true and verifiable, and if you were paying attention during these episodes, you would have understood exactly what was happening and why, at every step of the way. The common theme is that *no good hard fork proposals were ever made*, and so of course no developer consensus was ever found for the proposals that came forth despite their total and obvious lack of merit.
No, the Bitcoin developers have not been "ignoring" any of these proposals, nor the demands of the industry at large. On the contrary, they have paid attention, they have spent the time to explain what is wrong with each proposal in turn, and they have expended effort into protecting against the harm that these "attacks" might do to the ecosystem and Bitcoin as a whole.
A single good proposal for a capacity (and blocksize limit) increase was put forth. After discussing it and evaluating it, the Bitcoin developers (and community) decided it had genuine merit and that it warranted implementation, despite the negative externalities that might result from the limit being lifted significantly. SegWit was that proposal.
If you, or *anyone*, has another proposal worth consideration, by all means, **make it**! I am certain that it will be judged on its merits, like the others have been, and if it withstands honest scrutiny, you will have improved Bitcoin, and we will rejoice alongside you and celebrate your contribution. But conspicuously, no one is doing that, least of all you. People seem more interested in hurling insults, half-baked conspiracy theories, and assumptions-phrased-as-facts on reddit, which is easy to do but also a complete waste of energy.


I haven't said the phrase "deal killers" *once* in my entire history on reddit. If you want to build a strawman, go right ahead, but realize that this is exactly what you're doing.
What is a "deal killer" is an idea being terrible. I can explain *why* an idea is terrible, and am happy to do so, but I need to see a concrete idea (i.e. a formal proposal) before being able to tell you whether it is terrible or not, according to my own judgment.


No one has a "stranglehold" on the code. Bitcoin is decentralized, and ideas are judged by their merit by the open source community that contributes to it. If you have an idea with merit, let's hear it.
Otherwise... well, otherwise, quit wasting our time.

You actually assumed a number of things.


This is another assumption, and one which you should critically question.


Bitcoin is far more than interesting. It is *valuable*.


This sounds like someone who *doesn't* actually have a low-level understanding of the technology trying to criticize the technology on a low level. Frankly, in a technological sense, Bitcoin is probably the most advanced cryptocurrency there is. This would sound completely preposterous to someone who wasn't a very well-informed engineer (someone who, for instance, thought that a generalized state machine was "more technologically advanced" than a transactionally-optimized ledger), but it's truer than you seem equipped to appreciate.

To date, no DAG proposals have managed to present a realistic solution to the double-spending problem other than "just used centralized nodes with extra privilege for now"; if you're willing to introduce centralization and trust like that, there are far more efficient ways to build and maintain a ledger (even if you want it to be public).

Hey, kudos to you for actually doing some calculations! I'm actually impressed, not with the math itself (much less the conclusion), but with the fact that you actually *did* have a comment to reference on this point. Well done!
Now, it looks like you've made a great number of (seemingly deliberate) misleading assumptions in your calculation; you cherrypicked block  for instance, as the "full block example" and while it *did* contain 37k transactions, the other **three** full blocks seen on BCH (numbers 504017, 509060, and 496081) had an average of about **1333** transactions each. It looks like **most** full BCH blocks are processing *considerably less than half* of the transactions that fit into a typical (~1.1MB) Bitcoin block.
So if we use *accurate typical full BCH block figures* (rather than your blatantly-cherrypicked one), we have to change the following calculation like so:


Likewise, the more accurate figure means we have to change the following, too:


Wow, when we're not being disingenuous, that *really* paints a different picture, doesn't it?
And that's not even taking into account **Nielsen's Law** (which concerns bandwidth, the much more meaningful scaling bottleneck and limiting factor). Using Moore's Law instead unfortunately shows that you're about 5 years behind the current dialogue.
But heck, *even if we use the cherrypicked block*, and go with  like you want to, we run into a *huge* problem: this block only included $107 worth of fees. If such fee rates are going to be sustained, moving forward (which is the explicit design goal of BCH, lest we forget) then that means that in 2034, when the coinbase subsidy has dropped to the point of neglibility, the cost of reorganizing such a block will be on the order of *a couple hundred dollars*... oh dear. That paints an even *uglier* picture, if you ask me.
Again, props to you for doing any math at all (like I said, color me surprised). But let's try to use more accurate estimates, relevant laws, and altogether think things through a little bit more thoroughly next time, eh?

I agree completely. If you dig through my comment/post history you'll see a lot of my contributions over the years (and also see how much of an asshole I am, sadly). I used to write long-winded diatribes like [The Great Chinese Feedback Loop]( (when bitcoins sold for about $160 apiece) correctly predicting that the price was about to rocket upwards dramatically *and* that "heavily-restrictive legislation" would ultimately be the death knell that put an end to that particular moon-rocket... and though I'm pretty proud of such posts, it always seemed like I wound up arguing with people more than anything else after such submissions, no matter how often my reasoning was later vindicated. I've actually caused *multiple* "Buttcoiners" to delete their accounts (presumably out of shame), and again, this brought me a sick pride but not much else.
These days I've calmed down a bit, and I only go on long rants when I feel the situation *really* calls for it, and to be perfectly honest: the market has gotten a *lot* more intricate and complicated since those yesteryears. Nowadays things are much weirder and harder to predict, and surprises keep popping up everywhere you look.
I try my best to reason things through and show my work (and to keep my eyes peeled for the others who do the same), but man, it's gotten crazy recently and no one is smart enough to keep up with the Universe itself, magnificent engine of humility that it is.
Anyway, yeah, I agree.

The max blocksize *was* increased. It was more than *doubled*.
The thing is, we did *both* with SegWit. We paved the way for LN, and increased the maximum blocksize. All without breaking backwards-compatibility.

Re-read the comment. It doesn't say what you think it does.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:27:36
Good question. The btc.com block explorer is pretty good at breaking things down, but you might have to do some digging to get an accurate picture of things.
[Check out this transaction.]( 




The transaction's actual size is 249 bytes, including the witness data. However, after weighting (wherein each byte of witness data is counted as 1 weight unit and each byte of non-witness data is counted as 4 weight units), the "effective size" of the transaction (in this case labeled "virtual size") is only 168 bytes.
Note: this *doesn't* mean that the transaction is 168 bytes in size. That's a common misconception. SegWit doesn't make these transactions smaller (at least not unless and until you prune the witness data). The witness bytes are [still included in the transaction and transmitted normally, just serialized such that they can be selectively stripped if desired]( For most intents and purposes that have to do with fees, though, it is reasonable to consider the transaction as if its virtual size was its size, because in Bitcoin's consensus rules, blocks are now limited in terms of *weight* rather than *size*.
So in this example, by using SegWit, the user achieves a **33%** fee-rate reduction without any reduction in transaction priority. Of course, they still get to choose what fee to attach, so they might still pay more per byte than some non-SegWit transactions in the same block (if they wanted their transaction to be prioritized and were willing to pay for this benefit), so it's still a case-by-case thing. But in general, this is pretty typical in terms of the cost savings that using SegWit grants users (30-40%).

Wrong, and it sounds like you've been evading taxes (perhaps obliviously, but evading nonetheless).


Also wrong. Each individual trade (even from crypto to crypto) was already a taxable event.
Taxes and fees are two big reasons that many of us warn against day-trading.

When you ask "show me the victim" there are only two real possible types of victims to respond with: victims in terms of misinformation, and victims in terms of financial loss. As I've demonstrated, BCH has created victims of both types.
It's not like a cryptocurrency is going around shooting people. 


You're specifically asking for verifiable, factual proof *right now*. If I had tried to say "It will create more victims in the future" you would have just said "That's just speculation, and you could be wrong, you have no proof." So again, short term victims with proof available in the present **is specifically what you were asking for**. I have furnished exactly that.
Boy, you must feel embarrassed right now.

Unfortunately, the term "consensus" is rather badly [overloaded]( There is the "mechanical consensus" of the node software (particularly that of economically active nodes), there is the social consensus within the development and standards bodies regarding any given technical proposal, there is the wider societal consensus that inevitably factors into all definitions and matters of semantics. 
Describing the end result as an emergent economic Schelling point is fine, I'd say.

No, but nice attempt at creating a strawman.
BCH is an airdropped altcoin (originally comically called the "user activated hard fork") which has been steadily bleeding out relative to Bitcoin since its inception (though it did enjoy a couple of pump-and-dumps along the way). The rbtc subreddit is effectively an advertising platform for Roger Ver, and houses a community of shameless liars and noisy, conspiratorial sycophants.
I have never confused the two entities, though I am absolutely willing to acknowledge that rbtc is effectively *a propaganda engine* for BCH.


It sounds like you don't have a coherent investment thesis (or any substantive reasoning at all, for that matter). Frankly, the portfolio allocations of people like you, who seem to not bother with their research and mostly eschew critical thinking, is not that interesting of a subject.


Please, if you can find any errors in the reasoning or facts presented, do so! I'm happy to hear it. But if your *only answer* is "um this seems biased I think" then again, that's not particularly interesting or noteworthy, and it's not really relevant to the underlying point here.

You misunderstand me, and are arguing against a strawman. Some alt- and app- coins will certainly serve purposes, and find niches to fill and survive the test of time. I never claimed otherwise.
Your naivety is regarding the treatment of these coins as value-storage instruments, which they are not. The tokens will certainly *have* value, but will not be *value-storage coins* unless something goes stupidly awry in Bitcoin in a very specific way. Google "six sided network effect of Bitcoin" if you want to learn a little bit sometime.

No, you **completely misunderstand** how open source development works (not a developer yourself, I take it). Anyone can author and propose changes, and those with commit keys don't have any power (or even reason) to prevent you from doing so.
Of course, the only way that your proposed changes will be merged into the Bitcoin Core repo is if your proposed changes have gained obvious support, but that's one repo. You can always fork it and stick any changes in that you want, if you want to bypass peer review.
What your complaint boils down to is this: "I want to be able to leverage the Core development repo's popularity and esteem in the marketplace, which has accumulated over almost a decade of contributions, but I don't want to actually go through a peer review process for the changes I want to make. I should be able to slip those changes in anyway!"
Pretty obviously a dumb complaint when you step back and look at it!

What about [right here]( where I said:


To paraphrase the above, I was asking whether you misunderstood or whether you were purposefully being deceptive. I didn't say you were flat out lying *except* in the case where you *did* outright lie, by saying: "I asked you whether the internet exhibited the exact behavior I described" when you had done no such thing.
Now, once again, you are lying by claiming that "This is the first time you've said the 'either you're lying or you don't understand the point I'm making' part." I just provided a link directly to an earlier point in the conversation where I said the same thing (and asked you which one was the case). You ignored the question, so perhaps you never actually read it, but when you make a claim that this is "the first time" I said something along those lines, that's a(nother) lie.


I have a gift for speaking precisely, you mean. That's why when people try to argue with me, it doesn't tend to go very well for them, because I can go back and reference exact quotes where my precise diction continually strengthens my case. Unfortunately often, people take it personally when they have misunderstood something or have demonstrated a lack of knowledge in some regard, so rather than acknowledging their mistake and admitting it to themselves (which would allow for personal growth), they tend to get more and more defensive and emotional along the way.
In the rare cases where the other person is able to realize their mistake(s) and face them head-on, we usually end up becoming good friends and helping enrich one another's understandings and perspectives from then on.
It's your choice how you handle your own shortcomings; you can come to terms with them and rise above them, growing as a human being and perhaps forging a friendship in the process, or you can refuse to face them, hiding from the knowledge being presented to you and making an enemy out of someone who was willing to help you on your journey of knowledge. No one can make that decision for you, but I can certainly make a recommendation if you'd like.


Bitcoin can (and is) used as a "currency" according to that definition, and will most likely be used more and more often in such a capacity as it becomes more widely adopted, liquid, and functional. This is something that most "crypto-philosophers" (for lack of a better term) have been discussing since 2010, at least; during the bootstrapping phase (which we are still very much in), while the infrastructure grows, the technology (and not just the core technology, but auxiliary and complementary tech, too) is built and improved, and the price (and crucially, the correlated **liquidity**) grows past a certain threshold, the utility as a "payment network" will be minimal versus the utility as a saving or investing mechanism.
There very many reasons why spending Bitcoin as a "currency" makes less sense than saving it at this stage; it is highly volatile (and will remain so until liquidity improves significantly, which will almost certainly require a much higher price than the levels we're seeing even today), the price will continue to increase significantly until the market reaches a rational valuation for the asset (in other words, until it is saturated), there is considerable friction for micropayments as a result of the fees for on-chain settlement (which are a function of demand and the fact that second-layer order-of-magnitude scaling improvements and batching mechanisms are only just now being deployed), and relatively few businesses, services, and merchants are actually accepting Bitcoin in exchange for their offered goods and services. Furthermore, for most non-censorship-sensitive payments (at least in first-world contexts) there are already reasonably suitable solutions and infrastructure in place, with a 50-70 year headstart on Bitcoin's own, and hoping to compete with these existing networks on their own terms before having a chance to mature is simply naive.
That is not to say that Bitcoin will not *eventually* overcome these hurdles. It almost certainly will; the incentives and foundations are in place for it to do exactly that. However, it will take time, and it will not happen overnight.
The takeaway here, and the insight that I'm trying to provide you, if you will be so kind as to listen, is that the "best" (or perhaps more accurately "most rational") use-case of Bitcoin is going to evolve over time. Twenty years from now, obsessively saving/hoarding Bitcoin will not make quite so much sense as it does today, assuming it has reached mass adoption at that point. Once we're there, spending it like you would spend your dollars today makes much more sense for users to do.
If you had phrased your earlier question(s) more along the lines of: "Are there any examples where the typical use-cases of a particular network evolved and changed over time, as the network matured?" then the answer is obvious: **Yes!** The Internet is a fantastic example of this; at first, it was developed and used by the military, then by college campuses for academic exchanges, then by (relatively nerdy) end-users to email one another and join in discussion fora like Usenet, and then as a platform for the World Wide Web. Nowadays, it is used for shopping and e-commerce, for streaming and hosting videos, for social networks, and for systems like Bitcoin. The way that people use the Internet evolved *dramatically* over time. The same will be true of Bitcoin, and just like if you said "No one is watching videos on the Internet, so they *never will*", if you say "Almost nobody is using Bitcoin as a currency to pay for their goods or services, so they *never will*" you're making a fallacious and shortsighted argument.

(pasted from above)
I've written about this extensively, after having put a great deal of thought into the matter, because [this isn't the first time I've gone through this]( The TL;DR is the (perhaps initially surprising, but ultimately sensible) conclusion: judging from empirical evidence, the open mod logs of rbtc seem do more harm than good, and furthermore, such harm would almost certainly be exacerbated dramatically if were to publish our own mod logs.
If you would like to read more about the subject, see any of the following comments:
With the above said, I think that it's possible that at some point in the future, the situation could change and open mod logs for might potentially improve the status quo. For instance, if BCH continues dwindling in value and relevance until the more militant, conspiratorial, and zealous members of rbtc finally capitulate (or alternatively have their stubborn insanity demonstrated beyond even the tiniest sliver of a doubt, even from the perspective of relatively uninformed newcomers), then I could see public mod logs providing a net positive effect on But right now, for the reasons explained in the 11 linked comments above (and the comments that are, in turn, linked within those), it seems very much like it might do significantly more harm than good.
An intelligent, critical-thinking reader might notice that my argument above, having been expounded numerous times, continues to be outright ignored by the faction making the demands. Even more than that, the "open mod logs!" demand now seems to be deliberately weaponized as a [thought-terminating cliche]( notice the pattern that *whenever uncomfortable facts and unaddressable arguments are made, Roger Ver and his employees refuse to acknowledge them at all*, **even when it has been explicitly predicted, in the comment they respond to, that they will do so!** A couple of quick examples:
In fact, it's so bad that at this point, it's hard not to get the impression that Roger is actually *legitimately scared* of engaging with me:
I'll ping him (hey just to see if he's finally built up the courage to muster up an attempt at a response (and if he tries to claim that he's banned in as an excuse, know that he's lying and is free to post here)... but let's be honest with ourselves. The man is a coward, and almost certainly isn't going to respond, because he's **afraid** to.
But, unfortunately, I digress. The bottom line here is that yes, Roger Ver and his cronies are cowards unwilling to have a serious dialogue (even though I have made the offer plenty of times), and they continue to champion [a profoundly regressive cause]( and do everything they can to hurt or slow Bitcoin (not realizing that ironically enough, their efforts are having the opposite of their intended effect; antifragility is a fascinating phenomenon), and the "open mod logs or GTFO" thought-terminating cliche has already been addressed ad nauseum, but that doesn't stop the scared little parrots from repeating it as a soundbite.

Yes, if you make absolutely ridiculous assumptions at the most extreme end of the spectrum, you will wind up with the most extreme possible result. That's not that interesting of a point, though, and it *completely* ignores the bulk of my comment above. 
It looks like you're not really looking to understand things and making good-faith inquiries; you ignored the entire point, made an absurd assumption, reached an absurd conclusion as a result, and ended it there. 
To anyone reading this who is *isn't* an obvious troll, I'll point out two things:
1) By far the majority of the criticisms levied against the Lightning Network are along the lines of: "It won't be reliable or secure or useful or decentralized like on-chain transactions are, so it won't realistically provide a means for Bitcoin to reach global scales, as proponents hope." In other words, the argument is that *users won't use it because it wouldn't even be as good as vanilla Bitcoin*. Notice that the OP here has made the *opposite* assumption, that Lightning Network's utility will be *so* superior to "vanilla Bitcoin" that there would be effectively no need whatsoever for users to ever bother with their transactions reaching the chain. Apparently the new worry is that Lightning Network will be *too good*. What a terrifying possibility!
2) To truly understand the long-term dynamics of Bitcoin (and any layers built on top of it), you really have to appreciate that reality is comprised of various trade-offs and spectra; different actors and users have different needs, risk tolerance profiles, expectations, and preferences. Any assumption that involves *everyone* using a particular second layer *100% of the time* is pretty silly to begin with, even if that second-layer system hypothetically exceeded all expectations by a wide margin. I listed a few Bitcoin use-cases above off the top of my  head which the Lightning Network isn't designed for, and OP ignored all of them because they're a troll, but the point remains: Bitcoin is a strong (even "legendary") foundation for a wide variety of potential activities and utility, and different systems built on top of it will be optimized to cater to different niches in various ways. In the case of Lightning Network, it is optimized for instant or frequent transactions (especially those of relatively low value, i.e. micropayments), which the base blockchain architecture is quite obviously *not* optimized for.

Don't take that bet.
Not trying to be a curmudgeon here, but you're *way* too optimistic about Bitcoin's short-term growth. It's *possible* the price doubles again and maintains that level for the next 12 months, but certainly not likely.

It recently doubled in value...


For the sake of illustrating a point, let's ignore the fact that prices are not declining at all right now, and are actually growing at a remarkable rate (best performing currency *and* asset of 2015, thank you very much). I'll table that for now, and pretend like price actually *is* falling, even though the opposite is actually true.
How do we mesh these concepts? Well, we understand math and logic! It really is that easy!
Here, I've found that if you're having trouble understanding something, often the best way to fix that is to break things down into simple, "ELI5"-like thought experiments.
Let's say I am Satoshi Nakamoto, and I invented Bitcoin, but no one else is mining it yet, so I have the only bitcoins that exist.
One day, Alice and Bob decide they want in on this, but they'd rather buy the coin than mine it. I sell them bitcoins at $10 apiece, and boom, that's the market rate for a bitcoin.
A week later, Bob's car breaks down and he needs to buy a new engine. Bob was dumb and he invested more than he should have, and now he doesn't have enough money left over to afford the engine. He decides to sell a bunch of the coins he bought from me (for $10 each) so that he can fix his car, but neither Alice nor I are interested; we both have enough coins and aren't comfortable with buying more... Bob has to find new buyers.
Bob has plenty of friends, but most of them aren't computer geeks, and don't particularly believe in Bitcoin as the evolution of money. Bob manages to convince a couple dozen of them to buy his coins from him, but the most that any of them are willing to pay is $8 per coin. Bob isn't happy about taking a loss, but he needs an engine, and he has coins to spare in cold storage for the long-term, so he ends up selling a bunch of coins at $8 each.
Now there are 26 people using Bitcoin instead of 3 (that's an *exponentially growing userbase*), but the price fell from $10 to $8 (that's *declining prices*). QED

Hello, rbtc brigadier!
I've written about this extensively, after having put a great deal of thought into the matter, because [this isn't the first time I've gone through this]( The TL;DR is the (perhaps initially surprising, but ultimately sensible) conclusion: judging from empirical evidence, the open mod logs of rbtc seem do more harm than good, and furthermore, such harm would almost certainly be exacerbated dramatically if were to publish our own mod logs.
If you would like to read more about the subject, see any of the following comments:
With the above said, I think that it's possible that at some point in the future, the situation could change and open mod logs for might potentially improve the status quo. For instance, if BCH continues dwindling in value and relevance until the more militant, conspiratorial, and zealous members of rbtc finally capitulate (or alternatively have their stubborn insanity demonstrated beyond even the tiniest sliver of a doubt, even from the perspective of relatively uninformed newcomers), then I could see public mod logs providing a net positive effect on But right now, for the reasons explained in the 11 linked comments above (and the comments that are, in turn, linked within those), it seems very much like it might do significantly more harm than good.
An intelligent, critical-thinking reader might notice that my argument above, having been expounded numerous times, continues to be outright ignored by the faction making the demands. Even more than that, the "open mod logs!" demand now seems to be deliberately weaponized as a [thought-terminating cliche]( notice the pattern that *whenever uncomfortable facts and unaddressable arguments are made, Roger Ver and his employees refuse to acknowledge them at all*, **even when it has been explicitly predicted, in the comment they respond to, that they will do so!** A couple of quick examples:
In fact, it's so bad that at this point, it's hard not to get the impression that Roger is actually *legitimately scared* of engaging with me:
I'll ping him (hey just to see if he's finally built up the courage to muster up an attempt at a response (and if he tries to claim that he's banned in as an excuse, know that he's lying and is free to post here)... but let's be honest with ourselves. The man is a coward, and almost certainly isn't going to respond, because he's **afraid** to.
But, unfortunately, I digress. The bottom line here is that yes, Roger Ver and his cronies are cowards unwilling to have a serious dialogue (even though I have made the offer plenty of times), and they continue to champion [a profoundly regressive cause]( and do everything they can to hurt or slow Bitcoin (not realizing that ironically enough, their efforts are having the opposite of their intended effect; antifragility is a fascinating phenomenon), and the "open mod logs or GTFO" thought-terminating cliche has already been addressed ad nauseum, but that doesn't stop the scared little parrots from repeating it as a soundbite.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:34:04
That article is much more along the lines of what I was looking for (and very well written!). 
I also agree with your conclusion (that blocksize should be increased). Where we appear to disagree is exactly *when* this needs to be done.
I'd be fine with it being done in the next hour. I'd rejoice if that happened, because it would make all these doom-n-gloom redditors finally shut up. However, I'm also not worried *in the slightest* if this isn't done immediately, because I recognize that the incentive-construct of Bitcoin does not motivate solutions to problems before they actually manifest.
Look at the Transaction Malleability bug. It was a known attack vector for *years* before Gox tried to cast it as a fatal flaw in Bitcoin. When that finally happened, within about 2 days, every major exchange and wallet service had updated their code to account for the bug, and voila! Bitcoin was fixed (or more accurately, the Bitcoin ecosystem was fixed), as soon as it "needed" to be.
The following is not an opinion, but a fact, and I beg you to consider the implications: **every single time Bitcoin has encountered a serious problem (e.g. a systemic risk), a fix has promptly been deployed**.
*That* is anti-fragility in action. There are plenty of minor issues with Bitcoin that aren't being addressed posthaste because they are not critical, but *as soon as they become critical* (and almost never before), they are fixed very quickly. People respond to incentives, and the incentive to increase the blocksize is not strong right now, because a 1MB blocksize **is not creating any problems at the moment**.
It boggles me how many people have trouble understanding this.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:29:46
They fiddled with the difficulty-adjustment algorithm (more than once) in order to  allow the chain to survive with a tiny minority of hashrate. As a result, the difficulty adjusts much more quickly to drops in hashrate, which (besides weakening the tendency towards convergence around the most-work valid chain) results in figures like what you see here.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:37:47
Generally, yes, although airdrops don't always have to be in an exact 1:1 proportion. An airdrop is basically "granting free balances on a new coin's ledger based on the existing balances of an existing ledger (or multiple existing ledgers, e.g. what CLAMS coin did)".
Since hard forks without full community consensus are completely different (and incompatible) protocols themselves, they are functionally equivalent to any other altcoin, technically speaking. The recent "forks" like BitCore, Cash, Gold, Diamond, the new SegWit2x, Ruby, God, etc are effectively just new altcoins with Bitcoin-based airdrops (which is why many people in the Bitcoin community don't like to use the word "Bitcoin" when referring to them).
There are guides like [this one]( for claiming balances, and even a subreddit dedicated to such coins: ... some of the coins have proven to be outright scams, and their "wallets" have included malware in them, but others are actually claimable (like BCH). As always, if you're going to be doing anything with any of these, be careful and do your research (and *never* give your private keys to any service or wallet if these keys still control an existing Bitcoin balance; that would almost guarantee a loss of funds).
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:05:09

@_date: 2015-06-07 18:52:39
That's the gist of it, yes. Good job, thank you for finally acknowledging the primary point.
The entire reason why Bitcoin works, and exists, is because of the incentive-constructs that power it. Surely you don't disagree on this point?
If you carefully consider the incentive-construct of any given situation to do with Bitcoin, you should be able to predict, generally, how things will proceed. 
In this specific case (The Great Increasing-the-Blocksize Hardfork Debate), the incentive-construct is not structured in a way to motivate immediate action. **Yet.**
If you are expecting immediate action *before* the incentives align to result in such, you are very likely going to be disappointed. It would be fantastic if the problems were solved ahead-of-time and before they needed to be, but that's not how this works.
In a large, decentralized system where consensus is necessary for considerable change, considerable change can only be expected to occur when there is an undeniably-compelling reason for it to occur. See: every single large problem in Bitcoin's history (e.g. the integer overflow bug, the way transaction malleability is handled in the ecosystem, the March 2013 fork).
Do you honestly disagree with this view? If so, would you mind elaborating on why, exactly?

How do you figure this? The closest thing to precedent we have is the incident from March 2013, when everything was settled pretty satisfactorily within a couple hours. 
A hard-fork which increases the block limit would likely be rolled out and fully deployed *very* swiftly in the event of adoption suddenly jumping into eleventh gear. The possibility of a hardfork has been being discussed in the community for **years** now.
It certainly seems you're letting more than a little bias through in your analysis. It looks like you picked your conclusion ("Things will go wrong") and then tried to rationalize it into a believable possibility, no matter how far you have to stretch the logic and no matter how many flimsy premises must be employed. Why would an emergency hard-fork be so much more catastrophic than the fork in March 2013, which was an emergency which **came out of nowhere** (i.e. was not being discussed for months/years beforehand)?
I expected more out of you, to be honest. But if you'd rather preserve a negative bias than actually work towards a deeper understanding, that's your right.

Depends on what sort of hashrate is dedicated to the cause, of course. With 100% hash rate working towards it, the probability is 100%. 
For other rates, see [page 8](
    Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.
    q=0.1
    z=0 P=1.0000000
    z=1 P=0.2045873
    z=2 P=0.0509779
    z=3 P=0.0131722
    z=4 P=0.0034552
    z=5 P=0.0009137
    z=6 P=0.0002428
    z=7 P=0.0000647
    z=8 P=0.0000173
    z=9 P=0.0000046
    z=10 P=0.0000012
    q=0.3
    z=0 P=1.0000000
    z=5 P=0.1773523
    z=10 P=0.0416605
    z=15 P=0.0101008
    z=20 P=0.0024804
    z=25 P=0.0006132
    z=30 P=0.0001522
    z=35 P=0.0000379
    z=40 P=0.0000095
    z=45 P=0.0000024
    z=50 P=0.0000006
    Solving for P less than 0.1%...
    P &lt; 0.001
    q=0.10 z=5
    q=0.15 z=8
    q=0.20 z=11
    q=0.25 z=15
    q=0.30 z=24
    q=0.35 z=41
    q=0.40 z=89
    q=0.45 z=340
q is the % of miners who are working to reorganize against the current longest chain, z is the # of blocks that are being reorganized. P is the probability of success. 
Look at the final entry for some perspective. 340 blocks should normally correspond to a little less than 2 and a half days (though with less than half the hash-rate diverted to this cause, this would actually more likely take closer to 5 days in practice), so even with 45% of the network hash-rate working towards a reorganization that spans back more than 2 days, there is less than 0.1% of a chance of success.
A week-long timeframe, in contrast, should normally be about 1008 blocks. Even with 45% of the network hash-rate working toward this, the probability of success is too small for double-precision floating-point format to represent.
In other words, "basically impossible".
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:54:36
Good points, but I think you might be glossing over this part:


Bitcoin can obviously *survive* hardforks. It's almost certainly not going to outright perish due to a hardfork occurring. The problem is that there could be problems/costs to a hardfork that we, if at all possible, want to avoid. 
The most obvious potential problem would be a general loss of confidence and a corresponding drop in value. Every time a hardfork occurs, such a risk is incurred and unfortunately borne by *every single user*. 
Accordingly, it would be prudent to avoid any course of action that necessitates numerous hardforks in the future, if a viable alternative exists.
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:58:17


It shouldn't. With Bitcoin, the point is that changes can only be *voluntarily* adopted; not that changes can't be made at all. It's a huge distinction, and I find it remarkable to see so many people struggle to understand its implications.
When a change is clearly in the best short- and long-term interest of the network (e.g. when a network-level crisis manifests), consensus and therefore deployment regarding the change is accordingly more achievable. This is why I prefaced my analysis with the following:


The ledger is of course mutable if the majority can achieve consensus regarding the change.

Sure, if you're really so interested in starting a new discussion, I'll answer the question: Bitcoin has absolutely had a growing userbase since 2013, as any metric you can lay your hands on will indicate. The average daily price in 2015 was higher than that of 2013, too, so price is one of these metrics. Keep in mind that the higher (and recently ascending) price is *despite* the fact that 3600 bitcoins (worth about $16M at today's prices) are generated per day. That means that, one way or another, that much fresh demand is entering the market each day (at *minimum*), whether it manifests through miners or buyers.
So, yes, without a doubt the userbase (and cumulative demand) has been growing. Now, has this growth been "exponential"? I'll need you to define that term explicitly, as it regards to your criteria in this case, in order to be able to answer this component of the question.

The point is, once again, there's no need to merge it with Core at the moment. If the need arises, it (or another, superior solution) will be rolled out.
The integer overflow bug was fixed in a matter of hours. You know what one big difference between that situation and this one is? The urgency of the matter.
Consensus around solutions becomes exponentially easier when actual problems manifest. But when there are no issues with Bitcoin's operation at the moment, and plenty of aspects about the hardfork that should rightfully be considered and analyzed, it is a lot harder to achieve consensus quickly.
Are you under the impression that you have a more robust understanding of the matter than the core developers who disagree with implementing Gavin's proposal immediately (i.e. every one of them besides Gavin)? Or do you think they have a hidden agenda to kill Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-06-04 04:16:53
Wait, I'm severely confused...
Why would you limit the analysis to purely value-transfer data? You can't control how people use the blockchain... if they want to include stuff like OP_RETURN, that's their right. If this is occurring (and you yourself acknowledge that it is), then why should it be excluded from the analysis?
We're talking about a real-world change here. Picking-and-choosing the parts of reality that you like, and constructing a fantasy wherein we collectively cull our usage of Bitcoin to merely transferring value, is foolish and disingenuous.
Or are you proposing that we actively *prevent* people from doing what they want? 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:57:31


No, your credibility has taken a hit because you made the claim that "Bitcoin does not scale."
I'll copy and paste from my comment in another thread:
Blocksize should be increased, and it will be increased. Where we appear to disagree is exactly when this needs to be done.
I'd be fine with it being done in the next hour. I'd rejoice if that happened, because it would make all these doom-n-gloom redditors (such as yourself) finally shut up. 
However, I'm also not worried *in the slightest* if this isn't done immediately, because I recognize that **the incentive-construct of Bitcoin does not motivate solutions to problems before they actually manifest.**
Look at the Transaction Malleability bug. It was a known attack vector for years before Gox tried to cast it as a fatal flaw in Bitcoin. When that finally happened, within about 2 days, every major exchange and wallet service had updated their code to account for the bug, and voila! Bitcoin was fixed (or more accurately, the Bitcoin ecosystem was fixed), as soon as it "needed" to be.
The following is not an opinion, but a fact, and I beg you to consider the implications: **every single time Bitcoin has encountered a serious problem (e.g. a systemic risk), a fix has promptly been deployed.**
*That* is anti-fragility in action. There are plenty of minor issues with Bitcoin that aren't being addressed posthaste because they are not critical, but as soon as they become critical (and almost never before), they are fixed very quickly. People respond to incentives, and the incentive to increase the blocksize is not strong right now, because **a 1MB blocksize is not creating any problems at the moment.**
It boggles me how many people have trouble understanding this.

3) Are generally an unpleasant and rude person, and don't seem to be able to acknowledge this fact about yourself.
4) Spend large chunks of your time in internet forums full of people you disagree with (and want to antagonize)... not sure what the psychological term for this issue is, but it's definitely pitiable in any case.
5) Are so insecure that you can't handle a couple of downvotes and you throw a temper-tantrum when your comments are downvoted.

You called him a "dense fool" after he politely asked you multiple times to stop being unnecessarily rude to him. After you ignored him and continued to be overtly rude, which is essentially [the exact definition of an Internet troll]( he told you that he would only continue the discussion in earnest if you ceased with the trolling and ad hominem attacks.
He wasn't "dismissing facts as 'trolling'". He recognized that you were trolling, tried to be civil anyway, and ultimately decided that if you would not return the favor, that he was not going to bother feeding you.

Lead copy+paster *and* a developer, believe it or not. Certainly more competent than the other anti-Bitcoin "engineers" like Stone, Rizun, and Zander, at least.
He coded both the EDA and the DAA, the former being a total garbage fire and the latter exposing that his code decisions are unilateral and totally unchallengeable; he basically said "After thinking it over, we've decided to go with my algorithm rather than anyone else's!" and it turns out that the "we" was more of an "I" all along. This actually prompted Tom Zander (who was in charge of Classic's code) to say he was more disgusted with the developer "consensus" process in BCH than he was with Bitcoin Core, and to ragequit from Classic development altogether.

...and then later you tried to lump in **both Coinbase and Circle** into this category. BitReserve is a joke; Coinbase and Circle are not. It's ridiculously disingenuous to pretend that BitReserve's scheme/setup is "the way offchain services seem to be moving" and we both know it.

If you are able to make up some fantasy "Mike" who pays $8 for every Bitcoin transaction (but who will pay less if we make more transactions!) then I'm going to make up "Mitchell" who pays $10,000,000 for every single transaction denominated in USD.
Ok, now we have the following:
**Cost per Bitcoin transaction: $8**
**Cost per dollar transaction: $10,000,000**
Wow, Bitcoin really *is* cheaper! Sucks to be Mitchell, though.

@_date: 2015-06-27 14:48:33
Yes... And none of that has to do with the "cost per transaction"... 
The cost per transaction is the marginal cost to a miner of including a single transaction in a block... which is almost exactly $0.

You're very correct.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:14:00
You're confused. Bitcoin being the oldest (and most well-recognized) cryptocurrency definitely *does* factor in to its superiority, because one of the biggest deterrents to adoption is that the technology is so new and is not yet established as a monetary pillar in society. Bitcoin has the longest track record, and is thus the *most* established of any contender coins, for what that's worth. Similarly, the network effect that Bitcoin has developed since its inception plays a helpful role in distinguishing it from other coins in the space, and this network effect is in large part due to its longer history.
However, Bitcoin having superior technology relative to other coins is an entirely separate bonus, and this is actually not a direct result of its age. Bitcoin's tech or code has been steadily improved by an ever-growing base of incredibly dedicated, top-tier engineers for almost a decade now. These are the folks who find bugs in OpenSSL, create new (and more performant) generic algebraic optimizations for signatures and release cryptographic libraries that become industry standards... and they spend a significant portion of their time improving Bitcoin, often in ways that you wouldn't be equipped to appreciate unless you yourself had spent quite a few hours going through the nitty-gritty of the project's codebase.
On top of all that, we're fortunate that Satoshi was such a prescient and future-minded founder; Bitcoin's base-layer architecture is incredibly well thought-through. Satoshi seems to have been a master at high-level design, and whenever ideas to "improve" Bitcoin were floated (e.g. repurposing it as a general registry or state machine a la Ethereum or having the proof-of-work function serve a secondary purpose a la Primecoin), Satoshi would explain that the idea had already been considered during the design phase, and would offer his (remarkably sound and almost always later validated) reasoning on why Bitcoin wasn't built to incorporate it.
Bitcoin is the best thing ever, yes, but you don't seem to actually understand why.
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:47:56


No, it is not. You keep saying this, but it is blatantly untrue.
Timmy wants to send Bitcoin to his friend John, who lives in China. Timmy goes on LocalBitcoins, buys $100 of BTC from Ted, and sends it to John's address. He pays 0.5¢ in fees to ensure that his payment confirms within about 10 minutes. The payment arrives just fine, and Timmy and John continue about their day.
When all is said and done, Timmy paid 0.5¢ to make a $100 transaction. He did not pay $8, ever.
Tell me: is Timmy not "using" Bitcoin?

You really, really, really don't get what blockchains are good for. 
If you're just disseminating information (like a payroll service) then you can just send the information securely. That just requires encryption, at maximum.
You don't need to involve a blockchain for telling people what they were paid. That would be grossly inefficient. 
Perhaps an analogy might help. Using a blockchain to solve the "payroll problem" that you've described here is a bit like using the engine of a car to spread butter on your toast. It's possible to rig it up and get the job done with it, but it makes no sense at all.

That's not how language works. You can't say "I define 'breaking point' as 'typical fees rising slightly'" and magically make that the actual definition. Nice try, though.

I bought most of my coins sub-$100, so we're still more than double my primary entry point. I also cashed out more than my principal when I was up by 1000%. I can never be "in the red" even if Bitcoin goes to $0. I got kind of lucky.
With that said, I still do have a large stake in Bitcoin and absolutely am invested.
Also, it's not "bagholding" because that implies the asset is worthless. Bitcoin is probably the most powerful financial instrument in the world, so the term doesn't apply here.
P.S. the phrase is actually "in the black", not "in the green".

Lightning Network is *on top* of Bitcoin. It is a caching layer for the blockchain. It absolutely qualifies as "using Bitcoin" (or at least, it will if it is implemented as described). It sounds like you are not aware of what Lightning Network is or does, so you should [read up]( before you continue to make false assumptions regarding it.
You are still not addressing the final point I raised, however. Are you deliberately ignoring large chunks of my post here?

If a significant portion of Bitcoin nodes were being run as AWS virtual servers (like the "McNodes" that were spoofed to try to give the impression that XT, Classic, Unlimited, and S2X had far more user support than they ever actually did) then we would **absolutely** consider that a huge problem.
Running illusory "full nodes" like this is not a boon to the coin, nor to its decentralization.

Okay, I believe that I have identified the various misunderstanding(s) and miscommunication(s) that have occurred throughout this conversation (on both of our parts), so far. I'm going to try to paraphrase and summarize what has transpired, and let me know if you think I got anything wrong.
Another redditor (godlikeplayer) argued that most people aren't "using" Bitcoin (and that they most are merely "investing" in it). I spoke up to say that investing in Bitcoin *is* using Bitcoin. I argued that *at this stage*, investing in Bitcoin is actually the *most rational* current use-case of the technology. (Side note: the other redditor tried to argue that this is *not* a valid use-case, which splintered into a separate thread where you and I discussed "shoehorning Bitcoin into existing terminology" and whether or not I was dismissing arguments or criticisms without giving them due consideration.)
In response to my argument that investing is a valid and rational use-case of Bitcoin, you responded by saying that "No other network technology saw this kind of adoption behavior". Because I had already clarified that investing in Bitcoin *is* a way to "use" the Bitcoin technology and network, this argument did not seem to make sense from my perspective; after all, users were "using" the Internet in the earliest stages of its growth, albeit in different ways than users these days generally use it. In an attempt to once again reiterate the point that "saving Bitcoin is using Bitcoin", I responded with the answer: The Internet. My underlying point (which wasn't clearly expressed until much later in the conversation) was that *the usage profiles of network technologies will evolve over time, and Bitcoin is not unique in this regard*. Meanwhile, your underlying point was that *as a medium-of-exchange, Bitcoin is not currently being used nearly as much as it is a store-of-value (yet)*. At this stage, it seems that for the most part, we were talking past one another.
What I was (perhaps poorly) trying to express was the following: "Because Bitcoin is *money*, and one of the functions of money is as a store of value, it is distinct from other network technologies (e.g. the fax machine) in that it can be used *primarily* (or in the extreme case *exclusively*) as a store of value in the earliest stages of the network's growth." What you were trying to express was that "Other technologies have not exhibited this behavior (functioning primarily as a store of value before their other use-cases mature)." 
I pointed out that you can, of course, contrast different technologies against one another, and that there would be differences between them. You responding with a mention of Metcalfe's Law, and seemed to (mis)represent my argument as "You can't compare technologies at all". I pointed out that this was a misrepresentation/strawman. 
At this point, you claimed that Metcalfe's Law was "bullshit" (in that it was not applicable to Bitcoin), because (according to you), Bitcoin was getting "less and less useful" as it grew, and because Bitcoin was not equivalent to fax machines. I, again, pointed out that though the two technologies are not *equivalent*, they can be compared (as well as contrasted), and said that Metcalfe's Law still applied to Bitcoin because Bitcoin *is* still a network technology.
In the next few comments, we reiterated our respective arguments. Because I had felt misrepresented (at multiple points), I expressed dissatisfaction (perhaps in more colorful terms than was strictly necessary) and accused you of either dishonesty or asininity. Similarly, because you had initially been trying to focus exclusively on the medium-of-exchange functionality of Bitcoin (and its relative underemphasis at this stage), you also felt misrepresented because I had answered "The Internet" in response to your question about whether any network technology had exhibited a growth pattern like Bitcoin currently exhibits. In other words, you had been asking "Has any other network technology been used primarily as a store of value before transitioning or maturing into other use-cases?" and what I *should* have answered was "Not in recent history, *because no other network technology has been a type of money*" but what I *did* answer was a much-more-glib "The Internet" (because the Internet, like Bitcoin, was used in ever-more-interesting and dynamic ways as it evolved and matured as a network).
Most of the remainder of the conversation was a long-winded effort at narrowing down the various misunderstandings and talking-past-one-anothers that had taken place.
Let me know if that's a fair (or halfway-decent) summary, in your eyes.

He received over 80 bitcoins in a mere 2 transactions about 3 or 4 days ago. You can see these on the transaction list for the address, but you have to click back a page or two.

I [just responded to your post in the low-quality conspiracy subreddit]( to answer this question. It seems like you don't have a very good grasp of what Core even is, so it might be worth reading a *lot* more before you go around trying to start arguments about this stuff.


Okay, so you don't understand SegWit at all, it seems. SegWit **is** a blocksize increase. Any halfway-decent source of information about SegWit will inform you of this fact, but it sounds like you have been getting your information from *extremely* low-quality sources, unfortunately.
As for a "source" of this, the best would be the actual [source code itself]( but odds are you're not going to have the patience (or knowledge) necessary to understand that, so here are a few more links that might be easier to digest...
1) Go to [Blockchain.info's home page]( and look at the "Size (kB)" column. Notice how all of those blocks are *bigger* than 1000kB in size?
2) Use the [SmartBit explorer, sorted by block-size]( to see the biggest blocks on Bitcoin so far (~1.5MB in some cases).
3) Use [BTC.com's explorer]( to see the same things reported above.
4) Run your own node. Watch the size of your data directory grow as you download new blocks. You'll see it grow by more than 1MB each time a new block is found.
I can find you sources "stating otherwise" but you shouldn't be *trusting*, you should be *verifying*... something tells me you're not interested in the actual facts of the matter, though.

Adam Back likened channel balances to "opening a tab" (e.g. at a bar or restaurant you frequently go to) as an analogy.
Because obviously Adam Back is the devil incarnate and technology like the Lightning Network is a poison pill meant to kill Bitcoin and everything that is good in the world, they're all crowing and screeching about tabs now.

You're looking for confusion where there is none.


If you don't pay $8 to make a transaction, then it's not a "cost of a transaction". At all.
No one ever factors in the inflation of the USD when considering the cost of transacting in dollars. That would be absurd. Yet for some reason, you want to shoehorn Bitcoin's inflation into a "cost per transaction" figure, where it by no means belongs. All it does is show that you don't have critical thinking skills.
Users of Bitcoin don't pay $8 for the privilege of using it. I'm sorry, the cost per transaction is **not** $8, no matter how poorly you understand the system.
I can (and have) used Bitcoin many times, and never paid $8 to make a transaction. That is a fact. All the pontificating in the world won't change that fact.
I've RES-tagged you to make sure not to take anything you say seriously from this point forward. I'll also happily remind everyone how ignorant you are, whenever the need arises, and link back to this discussion as proof.

Oh, I wasn't emphasizing the exact ownership of the dollars, though of course you're right on that count. I was asking about whether or not they are "dollars" at all. By your own standards, those units in your bank account cannot rightfully be called "dollars" because they're not physical pieces of paper.
...but that's not a very useful perspective, since functionally, these units can (for the most part) be used as dollars and exchanged for physical dollars, so we still call them "dollars" as a society and treat them as such.

Oh dear heavens, no. Not even close.
The energy expenditure protecting against double-spends on Bitcoin is *leagues* ahead of any substitute coin. Liquidity, too.
"Network effect" might be worth a Google. Beyond that, technologically speaking, I have personally never found a coin optimized as money like Bitcoin is. Almost every altcoin seems to have sacrificed monetary utility for some gimmick or another (because to be honest, they have to, to distinguish themselves from Bitcoin).

This is flat-out incorrect. Namely, the difference is that a stress-test transaction is made with the sole purpose of stress-testing the network. This is, by definition, the difference between the two types of transactions, so your claim is incontrovertibly false.
Perhaps you meant "there is no way to distinguish between these two types of transactions on the protocol level" (which is a different claim entirely), but since you included the word "literally", you explicitly specified that this alternate claim is not what you are making. In other words, you guaranteed your own incorrectness, rather comically.

That's not a "breaking point" by **any** meaningful definition of the term. At all. That is **horrendously desperate** that you are trying to pretend fees rising, at all, is "the system breaking entirely".
You must have realized that you lost this argument if you're backpedaling that desperately.


First off, the [current default transaction fee]( is **0.0001 BTC**, not 0.00001... you're off by an order of magnitude. Your desperation here is getting more  palpable with each word you type.
Secondly, I will happily make this wager, as long as we include the provision:
**If the blocksize hard limit is increased before the year is up, you pay me 1 BTC.**
In fact, I will even make the bet with a 10:1 payoff, as long as this provision is included; i.e. I will pay you 100 BTC if I lose, and you only pay me 10 BTC if you lose.
Do we have a wager?

It depends on your definition of "fail" but check out [CoinMarketCap from 2013]( where a few of the top 10 coins were:
* [Feathercoin](
* [Terracoin](
* [Devcoin](
* [Freicoin](
* [CHNCoin](
As you can see, today some of these have market caps measured in *thousands* of dollars, and for all intents and purposes, it can be argued that most of the coins in the above list have "failed" (although admittedly none seem to have *completely disappeared*).
With the above said, I'll say that I think pretty much any one of the "Top 10" coins (as measured by the gameable "market cap" metric especially) could fail/die/disappear without "bringing the market down with it" *except* for Bitcoin. Altcoins don't really have the sort of influence that Bitcoin does; Ethereum could crash and burn and it would make Bitcoin seem *stronger* to the public eye, because it would validate the architectural/design decisions that went into Bitcoin and help to demonstrate how sound they were. On the other hand, if *Bitcoin* somehow failed in a big way, this might very well have big, negative implications for the wider cryptocurrency market, at least for a few years or decades.

Yes, it will prove this to anyone who is honestly willing to appraise the logs in question. What I've shown to you here (whether or not you will acknowledge it) is that no one honest is making these demands. Instead, it is a malicious community of liars who are willing to go to extreme lengths to deceive others who are making the demands, and (again, explained above) *there's no reason to acquiesce to their blanket demands and no benefit to doing so*, especially because anyone rational and even mildly-well-informed is able to see their insanity on full display as it is.

As another professional software engineer, I agree wholeheartedly.
But massive decentralized networks that require consensus (the blockchain) are not typical software, and the problem is not a technical one but a political one. That's why, unlike in traditional software, changes/patches aren't able to be made as soon as they're coded up - they need to also be accepted by a majority of the network, which can essentially only happen in circumstances that permit it.
Right now, because no one is being adversely affected by the status quo, generating meaningful consensus around a proposed change is effectively impossible (at least until a near-perfect solution is proposed). 
In any case, you haven't answered my question: do you disagree with the points I've made?

Oh, so the reason it got fixed quickly wasn't because it was an actual problem that needed addressing immediately, but rather, because it was in 2010 and there weren't many nodes. 
Ok, then with that logic: surely if another problem arose which needed an immediate solution, after the network had grown considerably... say, in 2013... then it would take a lot longer to fix, right?
[Oh wait, looks like another such problem was fixed in a matter of hours.](
Weird how my theory (that dire problems are solved quickly when they need to be) stands up fine when you consider empirical evidence... but your theory seems to be directly refuted by empirical evidence. Funny, huh?


Ok, so to be clear, you **are** making the claim that every core developer other than Gavin has a hidden agenda to prevent Bitcoin from scaling effectively.
I just want to make sure I understand your beliefs precisely.

We *are* planning ahead. That's what all this debate and discussion *is* - planning ahead.

Ok, they're working with their employer's benefit in mind. How, exactly, is that relevant to the discussion, though? It is only relevant if you *also* claim:
1) Their stance on the blocksize is solely based on their employer's interests.
2) Their employer's interests include stymying blocksize from growing.
Do you make both of these claims, too? 
Furthermore, at minimum, the first claim has been [definitively debunked by Gregory Maxwell.](


I didn't forget about him. He's not a core developer. That's why I said "every core developer" rather than "every developer".

@_date: 2015-06-26 01:05:47


Well Mike wasn't involved in any of the transactions, so it's not a "cost per transaction", now is it?


The point is that **the number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network.** At all. Sorry if this is too difficult for you.
Let me repeat that: the number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network, at all.
The number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network.
The number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network. At all.
The number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network... do you get it yet?


Where did I say that I'm "ok" with anything like this? My entire point has been, and continues to be: the number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network. At all. 
"Cost per transaction" is somewhere down around $0.00 to $0.005... not $8. Blockchain.info has a terribly-titled graph, and I never said I was "ok" with it at all, but keep misrepresenting me by all means if you have no better forms of argument to offer.


Feel free to take inflation into account. It has nothing to do with "cost per transaction", though, because the inflation would be happening regardless of whether there were 2 total transactions or 200,000,000,000. 
Inflation and "cost per transaction" are **entirely distinct concepts**. So, yes, it is absolutely absurd to say that the cost of inflation is the cost per transaction. A reasonably intelligent child could tell you the same thing.
And finally, in case you forgot:
The number of transactions does not correlate with the cost of running the network.

My ELI5 thought experiment clearly demonstrates that an exponentially growing userbase and a falling price are not mutually exclusive in any way, which is all it was meant to do. I am not arguing that Bitcoin has a total of 26 users, I am not arguing that I am Satoshi Nakamoto, and I am not making any specific claims regarding the behavior of early adopters. I am merely demonstrating, in an irrefutable way, that price can fall as userbase grows exponentially. That's all I set out to do, and surely you see that I have succeeded.
The fact that your reply is mostly "I promise I'm not trolling, and if you interpret that thought experiment literally it doesn't 100% accurately reflect reality" with a False Dichotomy thrown in at the end for good measure.

Point well taken; you're right. Sorry about that.


I suppose the impression stemmed from the "We're barely reaching 400k blocks today, **and we could get by with 300k blocks if we had to.**"
It kind of sounds like you're proposing we basically band together as a community and promise not to spam/bloat the blockchain. 
If that's not what you're proposing, and you're actually proposing instead for us to artificially *reduce* the max block size even further, then that's just as bad, but in a different way. If we lower the cap further, it's tantamount to banning newcomers from using Bitcoin, at least until a future fork were made to allow more traffic. This whole debate should highlight just how thorny of an issue hardforking Bitcoin is, though. Why set ourselves up for such trouble?


Understood and agreed, but the tricky part is *how* exactly you prevent people from doing so. The 1MB cap was a fine quickfix in its time, but we're at a juncture where we need to thoroughly and carefully consider a more robust and scalable solution to the problem; if you have a particular proposal that you advocate for this, I'm currently unaware of it.

You can ask whatever you want, the fact remains that I have, beyond the shadow of a shadow of a doubt, proven that an exponentially growing userbase and a declining price are perfectly capable of occurring simultaneously.
What's more is that I didn't even need to talk about inflation (i.e. block rewards) to do so. I did it all with a simple thought experiment that even a child could follow.
You can kick and scream all you want, but sound logic is sound logic.

You just said "nuh uh, you are" and linked to an arbitrary reddit thread... as if that somehow demonstrates that Bitcoin is at a "breaking point".

This is an awful weak breaking point. I will bet you 20 BTC that I can still make transactions 1 month from now, just fine.

Your entire series of tweets is about workflow and best practices. That's not what I am interested in. I'm interested in the actual specific considerations to do with this specific issue: the tradeoffs that each of the proposed Bitcoin scaling solutions entail. 
So you admit that you're not as qualified or well-informed as the core developers who believe that we should abstain from hastily changing the blocksize when there is no current need to do so... but you still think we should ignore their input and do something, *now*, because reasons.

I have no problem with Gavin's proposal, and I'm happy that he's rolling it out into BitcoinXT.
The point is, once again, there's no need to merge it with Core at the moment. If the need arises, it (or another, superior solution) will be rolled out. 
The integer overflow bug was fixed in a matter of hours. You know what one big difference between that situation and this one is? The urgency of the matter.
Consensus around solutions becomes exponentially easier when actual problems manifest. But when there are **no** issues with Bitcoin's operation at the moment, and plenty of aspects about the hardfork that should rightfully be considered and analyzed, it is a lot harder to achieve consensus quickly. 
Are you under the impression that you have a more robust understanding of the matter than the core developers who disagree with implementing Gavin's proposal immediately (i.e. every one of them besides Gavin)? Or do you think they have a hidden agenda to kill Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:59:11

Overall, a very well-written article, surprisingly accurate and professionally presented information.
The most misleading paragraph in the article, though, is hands down this one:


The witness signature data is included in the blocks and transactions themselves, it's not "running in parallel along the bitcoin main blockchain" whatsoever. Segwit transactions are serialized so that their witness data is *at the end of the transaction*, not *taken out of the block entirely*. Importantly, this data *can* be stripped out on demand (because it's cleanly separated at the end of each transaction), which is [pretty cool for a lot of reasons]( But it's not quite the same thing as a true [extension blocks]( proposal.
Still, a decent article on the whole.
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:47:00
It was a soft fork.


Exactly, thanks for arguing my point without realizing it?


And it was a last-minute thing organized through IRC. Meanwhile, the ecosystem has been discussing this hard-fork for a long time (mining pools, companies like Coinbase and Circle, and developers alike are aware that when the time comes, a fork will occur, and are provided ample preparation time as a result).
You think a last-minute unexpected emergency in 2013 will proceed relatively smoothly, but an eventual fork that has been debated and discussed ad nauseum for *years* would be catastrophic?
That just doesn't make any sense.

My thought experiment irrefutably proved that price can drop as userbase grows exponentially. Surely you'll admit that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:31:27


It's not "distortion", it's a straightforward fact.


No, the blocks are bigger than 1MB, period. If you prune the witness data, they are smaller than 1MB (just like they are if you prune the other data in them, which you are free to do).


Yes, and that would be the case no matter what. If Bitcoin had hard-forked instead of upgraded via soft-fork, those same nodes would be *completely forked off the network* and *completely vulnerable to fraud*.
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:02:45


It's not "me personally", it's anyone who wants to use Bitcoin at all, i.e. Bitcoin users. In my example above, neither Timmy nor John nor Ted paid $8 and they all used Bitcoin.
It's not a "cost per transaction" because the cost does not actually map to transactions at all. 
According to your (hilariously naive) argument, if I go out and make tens of thousands of microtransactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, the "cost per transaction" for everyone else will fall dramatically. Suddenly, it wouldn't be $8 per transaction, it would be $4, or $2, or &lt;$1. But nothing would have actually changed, except that I was spamming the network. It wouldn't suddenly mean Bitcoin is more efficient or cheaper to use.
And you *still* want to call this a "cost per transaction", despite the facts I've listed above? Get real here.




You seem to have linked to the wrong chart. You're linking to a chart about Bitcoin transactions; I said "No one ever factors in the inflation of the **USD** when considering the cost of transacting in **dollars.**" 
The fact that you couldn't even understand the above statment is enough to showcase what kind of intellect you're packing.

...if all 60 million of them bought at once... and if they all required an on-blockchain confirmation of their coins (i.e. they don't use Coinbase or an exchange or some other similar service to buy)... and if the blocksize was not increased almost immediately as a result of the massive influx of new Italian users...

Then perhaps it's premature for you to try and label it as "not using Bitcoin"? I'd say step one is to understand the subject, and you shouldn't move on to step two (discussing what it does or does not represent) until you've completed step one.

Well done on your trades - I'll take you word on it that the account is true, since you seemed savvy enough when you were active in the other sub. "Right or rich" is a good position to be in, too, so good job setting it up.
In case it wasn't clear, though, I wasn't trying to argue that Bitcoin represents a solid escape route from the Venezuelan bolivar - though it's conceivable that it could. Instead, I was just pointing out (in my signature annoying way) that Bitcoin crashes are different than typical currency crashes (e.g. Venezuelan bolivar right now), because other currencies do not regularly appreciate massively in value... in fact, they are, by design, structured to do the exact opposite: decline gradually in value. (Or would that be the inverse, rather than the opposite?)
In any case, a drastic collapse of purchasing power following a massive bull-run is decidedly different than a drastic collapse of purchasing power in a currency that steadily declines in value anyway. Surely you'll agree on that point, at least.
Regardless, sorry for any snarkiness. Bad habit of mine.

There was no chain split with BCH, though. All nodes, clients, and wallets (even those using SPV) remained unified on the sole Bitcoin chain, which now supports Segwit.

In my opinion, such events would undoubtedly *strengthen* confidence in Bitcoin.
The collapse of (pretty much any) altcoin reinforces and demonstrates Bitcoin's value proposition. The public response from Bitcoiners would be: "Hooray!" and the public response from most non-Bitcoiners would (basically) be: "Some coin other than Bitcoin just died. Okay."

It would be mind-bogglingly irrational to dump bitcoins for fiat if bitcoins  appreciated by another 10,000%. In fact, what would more likely happen is that fiat would get rapidly and constantly dumped on the open market for bitcoins, in this scenario, because it would be obvious at that point what the winning horse is.

I didn't use the word "alts" so you must have typed up what's between those two quote marks manually. Weird and (slightly but pointlessly) misrepresentative.
Furthermore, it certainly came across like you were trying to imply that altcoins *matter*, relative to Bitcoin. Since you weren't trying to imply any such thing, apparently, then we have no argument.

The days when Bitcoin responded directly to news items like this are now many years behind us. It's much, *much* more sane to keep an eye on *where in the larger market cycle* we are than *what specifically was announced* on any given day, if you're tracking or predicting the price.
Right now, we're in a post-bubble bear market, whether or not anyone likes it. News like "Starbucks is doing something with Bitcoin" isn't going to magically cause a rally because it's not 2011 anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:17:20
You're exactly right. Being a store of value and a functional currency is **not** mutually exclusive.


What has actually happened is that a small portion of the former Bitcoin community has decided to try to "steal the Bitcoin brand name" and pretend like a certain altcoin is Bitcoin (when it factually is not), and part of their propaganda campaign is to create and promote this illusory false dichotomy you've identified. It's silly, but it's the best they can do.

Technically it's not the *limit* that determines bandwidth usage (nor RAM usage), it just sets a de facto *ceiling* for these figures. If the limit were trillions of weight units or megabytes, but no one was using the network, then both bandwidth and RAM requirements would be accordingly low.
With that said, see the [statoshi bandwidth charts]( for a decent glimpse into what sort of bandwidth a normal node requires right now, and the [UTXO charts]( for a decent glimpse into what sort of RAM requirements are demanded by running a local node (since the UTXO set is basically what you want to be accessible in memory).
To answer the question you're getting at, though: both bandwidth and RAM requirements can be modeled as **O(N)**, meaning that they scale linearly according to network usage, when we're analyzing things from the perspective of an individual node (whereas both would be **O(N²)** when viewed from a holistic, network-wide perspective, which is less relevant, because what we really should care about is [the CONOP]( and that's a per-node figure). See [this excellent piece by BitFury]( written in 2015, for some more insight into the matter.

Since the only thing I ever asked or cared about was "what special attributes would an AI market prediction token exhibit?" I went ahead and took a quick glance at the Cindicator [whitepaper]( to see what they have to say about the token and its properties:


indicators, indices, data, services, information, and analytical products. The
level of access and the products and tools available will depend on the quantity
of tokens in each holder's possession, which will in turn be influenced by each
token holder's role and active participation in the decentralised ecosystem.


to buy them openly (for residents of countries where the purchase of
tokens does not violate local laws), gain access to new products, or sell them
to interested traders, analysts, or investment funds. Tokens cannot be sold
to residents of the USA, Singapore, PRC, or other countries where the sale of
tokens may require registration as a security.


USA, Singapore and PRC prohibits the sale of CND tokens to the residents
of those countries. When you buy CND tokens, you should be aware of the
restrictions on their subsequent sale and promise to follow our instructions
and/or those of the exchange when reselling them to other users.
Tokens that represent internal reward-point vouchers, stake in private companies or initiatives, or tokens that are akin to power-ups in Candy Crush or Starbucks Gold points... these aren't particularly interesting or revolutionary. I don't think you'll find anyone seriously arguing that such tokens will ever be worth *absolutely nothing* or *completely disappear*; that's a strawman argument. Both Starbucks Rewards and Candy Crush power-ups exist, and neither are free, after all. But generally, when we're talking about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and their awesome potential, we are implicitly focusing our discourse on these systems' *relative* degrees of impact. In other words: *who cares* about the "potential" of American Airlines issuing crypto-tokens to represent frequent flyer miles, when we're talking about the potential to replace the scaffolding of *money itself*?
So if your argument is basically that "other tokens will continue to *exist*" then you're not going to find many people arguing against you, no matter how much they like or dislike Bitcoin itself. But if you start trying to argue that "other tokens will make a more meaningful global impact than Bitcoin" or "other tokens will outperform Bitcoin as investments over the long-term" then you might encounter a lot more friction.

There appears to be strong opposition to it happening **now**, before it needs to happen. This point continues to soar over your head. How many times do I have to repeat it? Did you go back and read my comment, or did you skip that step once again?
It is not a case of me being optimistic and you being pessimistic. It is a case of me understanding how incentives work, and you not. And it's also a case of you refusing to acknowledge this point (since you have continually avoided the insight that I'm trying to provide).
If you're going to keep skipping over the primary point that I'm making, we're never going to get anywhere. 
I'm not sure if you're deliberately trying to avoid the point, or what... but it's really preventing me from "getting through" to you.
Once again, I implore you to re-read the comment, but this time, focus on the "incentive-construct" part; that's the important assertion. If you don't understand or address this point (because it's the crucial point that I'm making), then you won't understand the rest.

We might start flagging these submissions as off-topic with an accompanying recommendation of other subreddits where it might be more relevant (e.g. and Other than that, we're basically just waiting for the community to "get over it," but it's an uphill battle, since drama has a gravity to it and Roger Ver (and his army) are absolutely shameless in their desperation to receive attention at all costs.

The issue is that rbtc is *defined* by their antagonism towards the greater Bitcoin community and a total unwillingness to compromise or seek meaningful consensus.
If someone's position is (quite literally) that they will not in any way collaborate, consider any input, or even to accept *their own preferred scaling solution* if it were offered by "the other side", there's nothing you can do to "come together" with them, by definition.
You might be tempted to say "But that's not really their position" or something along those lines, but *it is*. For example, [in this exchange]( where the question was asked: "Is there anything Core can do to change your mind and get you to support the efforts of Core?" and the unhesitating response was "No"... The follow-up question was: "**Even if Core advocated exactly what BU is advocating as a scaling solution?**" Once again, the unhesitating answer was "No."
I've seen the *exact same perspective* expressed and repeated dozens (if not hundreds) of times, on a regular basis, by prominent members of the rbtc community. For the most part, they all strongly feel this way. They are **100% unwilling** to work with (or even hear out) anyone who they perceive as an outsider, and that categorically includes every current Core contributor.
At a certain point, you have to acknowledge the reality that they don't want to be on the same side as any of us, and that they've defined themselves as "anti-Bitcoin" while telling themselves the opposite is the case. And the worst part is, they won't stop harassing and denigrating Bitcoin and its community, even though they now have their own coin that they could be focusing on instead. They decided that their strategy would be to "Win by killing Bitcoin" (which is **not** a smart strategy) and have been on a multiple-year-long crusade to achieve this at all costs.
Unfortunately, rbtc is basically the community equivalent of "The Enemy of Bitcoin", a title they inherited from Buttcoin before them. The idea that "we should all just try to get along" doesn't work with a belligerently hostile splinter group hell-bent on your downfall.

By far my favorite resource for understanding how things work with Segwit transactions is [this album of 6 images]( By just coloring the bytes and giving tiny explanations of it, I feel like the mechanism is conveyed perfectly.
The witness data can be stripped out by any node or user who doesn't need it, since there's a nice little flag in the Segwit transactions which says "here is where the witness data starts". So if any nodes/agents which aren't recent enough to understand the Segwit witness format (or which don't require full validation of said witness data, for whatever reason) ask for the block data from you, your node software can essentially prune out that witness data on-the-fly before sending the block over.
This is the "trick" that allowed the maximum blocksize limit to be increased past the 1MB limit without booting old nodes off the network. They receive pre-witness-pruned blocks from modern nodes (though it's worth noting that [not many nodes are still running pre-0.13.1 software](

[UTXO commitments]( and [Spoonnet stuff]( would be the best candidates, if you ask me.


This doesn't require a hard fork, nor even a soft fork. This is just a per-node relay policy, and can be changed at any time by any node operator.


Segwit allows Schnorr signatures to be implemented via a soft-fork.

The subreddit was created for Bitcoin originally (and yes, Bitcoin has the **BTC** ticker). Roger Ver eventually acquired (almost certainly bought) it, and now uses it as a BCH-propaganda outlet.
It's not that "a lot of people who support BCH moved there", but that those who *don't* support BCH are usually aggressively downvoted and/or banned from the subreddit when they try to post there. Roger Ver owns the subreddit and pays employees and shills to say what he wants them to say.

Thank you once again for understanding.
If people keep "hoarding" bitcoins, they are agents of demand and they reduce supply, driving the price up. If this continues, the demand will increase even *more* because it sustains Bitcoin as an attractive investment. Since the supply of Bitcoin is systemically predetermined and more predictable and stable than *any* other system of money ever conceived, eventually this demand will reach an equilibrium with the supply. At that point Bitcoin trade should blossom.
Before then, as demand is surging explosively, the rationality of eagerly spending your bitcoins is very questionable. Sure, do it if you're so inclined, and it will definitely encourage adoption during this "bootstrapping" phase, but by no means feel guilt over preserving your stash short-to-mid-term i.e. "hoarding".

They stole the funds thinking Transaction Malleability was a magical "anyone can steal anything" bug. This is absolutely not the case.
Later, it was demonstrated that only 386 bitcoins could have been stolen due to TM, total. SR2.0 had been claiming thousands were stolen from them alone. In short, their story was debunked.
The original plan was not to give the money back. They came up with that idea later.
It's also not a "hit in reputation" at all as you can see from all these reddit posts. Make a big deal about giving back the money, generate some press, trick the community into advertising your scammy site for you. Looks like their plan has worked perfectly, sadly enough.

So at this point Gox just credits the unconfirmed Bitcoin back to the attacker's account? 
...no, no they do not. 
You're glazing over the step where Gox fucks up and doubles the Bitcoin. That's the part that wouldn't be happening over and over and bleeding them dry. It cannot be handwaved by saying "oh, so the bitcoin's gone but Gox still thinks it's in their system" because even if they think it's in their system, they do not err on the side of giving too much Bitcoin to the customer. You'd have to contact support and bring it to their attention, and convince them to update your account balance to "correct" it. Gox's customer support is the weak link in this scenario; no way have they been over-crediting accounts left and right while their BTC evaporates. 
If you've never dealt with Gox's customer support it might seem possible they would do something like that. But not Gox. No, not Gox.

That theory is so silly that you should doubt the intelligence of anyone who entertains it seriously for more than a few minutes. It would mean that Satoshi, master of anonymity, made a few clumsy mistakes: 
* He [weirdly praised himself and then praised himself back](
* He [responded to his own mailing list debut very early on]( (notice that Hal even said: "Unfortunately I am having trouble fully understanding the system" and asked a few questions like: "I also don't understand exactly how double-spending, or cancelling
transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster
more computing power than all the honest participants. I see that he can
create new blocks and add them to create the longest chain, but how can
he erase or add old transactions in the chain?" and "As far as the spending transactions, what checks does the recipient of a
coin have to perform? Does she need to go back through the coin's entire
history of transfers, and make sure that every transaction on the list is
indeed linked into the "timestamp" block chain? Or can she just do the
latest one? Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that
the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing
the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?")
* He [awkwardly contributed code using his "halfinney" account]( rather than consistently using his "satoshi" account
* He conspicuously [sent the very first Bitcoin transaction to himself]( (*and publicized his True Name as the recipient for some reason!*) despite the implications that this would have in terms of identifying himself.
This theory makes about as much sense as "Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian Nakamoto, and just decided to use his real name as his nym."

My views on the matter (and I understand you probably disagree for the most part) is that bundling the mining subsidy with the transaction verification functions of the network was a brilliant move, because while yes, the newly mined/minted coins are diluting existing holdings, this is also true of all alternative currencies today - that is, fiat money is also being diluted (and much less predictably, stably, and transparently).
So even if we're paying for the transactions of the network in a roundabout complicit way by accepting the continual block rewards that are being produced every ten minutes, there is no superior alternative in which we can bypass this sort of subsidy. At least in Bitcoin, anyone can mine (i.e. there is no privileged Federal Reserve-esque entity who has total behest over the money supply and the distribution thereof) and if you think miners are being "rewarded" too much by their activity you are always free to take part (by purchasing ASICs or cloud mining shares or whatever).
In short, I fully support the subsidy and the externalities thereof. It allows end-users to send thousands or millions of dollars without any fees on a regular basis, and the "hidden inflation fee" isn't really a drawback unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:21:46


Absolutely and utterly irrelevant. It doesn't matter that altcoins can do the same thing, because that has *nothing* to do with the intrinsic value of Bitcoin. 
By your argument, **silver has no intrinsic value because there are still copper, gold, aluminium, beryllium, and tungsten which have the same utility.**

Actually, "inflation" can refer to both an increase in the monetary base, or to price inflation (i.e. "loss of purchasing power per any unit of money").

People mining Bitcoin are participating in Bitcoin. You'd be literally handing them money to invest in the Bitcoin backbone. You'd incentivize network growth, in other words.
You're not really hurting the ecosystem when you participate more than everyone else combined, *and* opt to pay more fees than everyone else. In fact, you would be the best thing to happen to Bitcoin. What you're describing would be altruistic and beneficial to the network... at least until you had donated all your capital to the miners.

Mt. Gox is the least reliable and most publicly hated exchange in the world. It has been that way since April 2013. 
It has been that way largely because USD has been impossible to withdraw from Gox for over half a year now. The exchange has had a 5-20% premium in price over every other exchange as a result. The community has time and time again complained that the media still focuses on Gox. Thousands of "please please please stop quoting Gox prices" have flooded this and other Bitcoin subreddits for ages.
If your reading led you to believe Gox was the most reliable exchange in the world, your reading comprehension levels are essentially nonexistent. Gox have been a black stain on Bitcoin for quite some time and this has become a point to circlejerk over in this community.

Right and right.


Not quite. The number of miners can remain the same, even as full node resource requirements increase. Just because it costs more to run a node doesn't mean we "need" more miners.
Of course, the more different miners that are running, the better, because that means more mining decentralization (which strengthens Bitcoin). But technically Bitcoin can keep running even if it costs too much for almost anyone to run a node, and it winds up being one miner mining every block. This scenario would be a bad thing (and I personally would consider it to represent "Bitcoin failing to be what it was supposed to be") but the blockchain would still continue to grow and function.


Ah, yes, that makes sense.


That also makes sense, and is a good point.


I don't think users should *have* to run their own nodes, but that they should be *able* to. As long as it remains possible and reasonably affordable to self-validate the chain and your own transactions on the network (and as long as miners remain reasonably well distributed), Bitcoin's peer-to-peer foundations remain strong, and the decentralized model continues to work as intended. That doesn't mean that every user *must* run a node, just that they must remain *able* to if they want to.
If the cost to self-validate gets out of the reach of normal users and businesses, then trust leaks back into the system (i.e. every user must trust a node-runner to validate the consensus rules on their behalf), which robs Bitcoin of its unique properties, and renders it vulnerable to centralized control. In the extreme example, where one company is the only one running any nodes, they would be the rulers of Bitcoin and have full control of the system; they would be able to generate infinite coins, take people's money at will, prevent some users from transacting, or anything at all, really. The reason no single company, government, or entity can do that now is because others who are running full nodes would reject their efforts, making it costly and useless to even attempt. If running a node is impossible for anyone but them, this all-important factor disappears.

Furthermore, Satoshi never "chose" Gavin to be "the leader of Bitcoin" (and in fact thinking in terms of "leader of Bitcoin" shows that you're either trolling or that you don't get it). Gavin ported Satoshi's source code over from Sourceforge to GitHub, and Satoshi didn't explicitly *object* to him doing so. Ever since then, Gavin's gone around trying to pretend like he was "Satoshi's chosen successor" when that is clearly a blatant misrepresentation of the facts.

There is no such thing as an "implied fee due to structured block rewards from mined coins" - there are transaction fees, and there is monetary-base inflation. These are two distinct phenomena and are appropriately viewed as such. Conflating the two will only lead to confusion and misunderstanding.

It doesn't matter how many exchanges you use. The aggregate **liquidity** (which is what you must have meant when you said "market cap") for all the exchanges still can't handle such a large sell order. Not even close.

And if you're not selling them in a short period of time, guess what you *are* doing: holding. Even temporarily, you're introducing demand into the ecosystem and limiting supply.

I've already explained: if you're interfacing with fiat, you **cannot** escape its inefficiencies. The only way to realize the efficiencies of Bitcoin is to use Bitcoin. As soon as fiat is introduced into the equation, you're going to be dealing with the woes it brings with it. 
There's no irony. You're attributing to Bitcoin the problems that it actually solves, by bundling the fiat conversion into what you're calling "Bitcoin payment processing". If no fiat conversion were done, you'd be left with virtually instant, virtually feeless transactions any hour of any day of the week, all in Bitcoin. All the negatives are swiftly stripped away as soon as you remove the fiat part of the equation.
Of *course* a service that offers conversion to and from fiat is going to rely on fiat institutions. Again, no irony.

@_date: 2014-07-21 14:26:10
It's all very self-explanatory. Details would make for a longer post, but no  more solid of a refutation of your self-evidently inaccurate claims.
As an example, when you said that merchants using a payment processor such as Bitpay get "none of the benefits of Bitcoin" it is absolutely trivial to see that this is false. They specifically benefit from the decreased transaction fees and free press. The rest of your points are similarly trivial to disprove.
When your argument doesn't actually have any intelligence or truth embedded in it, not much time or effort is required to refute it.
Better luck next time, kiddo.

It is true, and the vast majority of cryptocurrencies have worked hard to abuse the metric in this exact way.
Instead of saying "Well then why aren't coins doing that already?" you should be taking a step back and realizing that *they are*.

Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses? They cost more, they're slower, they're more dangerous, the gas they run on is harder to procure than hay, and they're confusing!" Of course they are, at first. Technology needs time to mature.

Cool and thanks for the info.
Fully agreed that it's smart not to store money on any marketplace, dark or not, unless you're buying right then. For the "check seller activity/ratings" advice, though, it doesn't work if the site admins are corrupt, since they can (and allegedly do) create fake vendor accounts with perfect feedback and history, which then "go rogue" and rob a bunch of buyers at once. I'll be honest in that I can't verify firsthand whether this is happening, but I've seen compelling arguments made that it is, and it's a scary enough prospect not to take the chance in my opinion.
Combine that with the lack-of-details regarding the initial "theft" itself and that's more than enough red flags for me. Unless you absolutely know a vendor is legit, I wouldn't risk a farthing over there.
This is one of the few times I hope I'm wrong. If the guys just messed up, got robbed, and are legitimately doing their best to reimburse the victims, that is a heartwarming story. I just don't believe it with the details I have now, and I'm waiting for the rainy day when something really nasty happens (or it's confirmed that nastiness has been happening subtly for a while).
@_date: 2014-05-28 23:28:02
Because the admins are proven scammers and thieves, the worry is that one day you will send funds to the marketplace and be robbed of those funds.
To further prove the point: [a total of 386 bitcoins could have been stolen from SR2.0 due to Transaction Malleability.]( That is assuming that **every single successful TM attack was against the SR2.0 and none were against Gox or any other businesses**.
Yet thousands were stolen, according to the admins. 
Explain to me, how does their story make sense again?
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:23:25
How did malleated transactions rob the Silk Road?
Explain to me the mechanics. Explain to me what exact vulnerability was exploited. Was it automated? If so, where's the code? Was it human-approved? If so, why did you send thousands of bitcoins without checking where you were sending them?
They have not, and will not, explain this. They cannot explain it, because it did not happen to them so there is no explanation that fits, *other than the one where they steal the bitcoins which they've apparently given about 82% back as of today*.
What makes more sense, a bunch of drug-dealers who foot, out-of-pocket, thousands of bitcoins for the sake of community, right after having been robbed of their entire business?
Or con-artists paying people back with their own money as they work a more sustainable con, after their story fell apart?

The bottleneck is not FLOPS. 


So basically you're going to make a bunch of largely-unfounded assumptions and try to piece them together in a way to preserve your old absurd hypothetical? That's one way to do it, I guess.
I can think of a number of components that would factor in to "costs of maintaining a global transaction backend" and a substantial chunk of them, I'm sure, are salaries and wages. 
The rest of your comment appears to be you trying to suss out whether Bitcoin will "win out" in a big way versus banks and what sort of strategies they may employ to preemptively address the threat. That's not really what I'm talking about, though. I'm convinced Bitcoin has a future and is greatly undervalued at this time, if you want my opinion on the topic, and I acknowledge that there is a risk of it collapsing dramatically, so I share the "all or nothing" opinion, to a degree, but that's besides the point.
My sole point here was that deploying some sort of blockchain solution makes no sense if there is central control. That is all I am on about. And it's true, and it's an indisputable fact. 
Even if you want to argue that the banking sector has a giant unsatisfied demand for processor power to assist with their accounting functions, it would be dumb to prescribe a blockchain solution to assist with this problem. A blockchain achieves distributed consensus at the tradeoff of speed and efficiency, and for other problems there are superior solutions. In this case, parallel computing or mapreduce-like functions are what you would probably want to look into.
No matter how you try to spin it, at the end of the day, if you're fine with centralized control, there are cheaper and better and less risky ways to go about things than a blockchain. This is not a lack of imagination on my part, this is me understanding that a blockchain is an inarguably suboptimal solution compared against the most efficient or appropriate alternatives for any given problem or problem-set, *if distributed consensus is not desired*. 
I feel you're starting to see what I mean, which is incredibly relieving.
Your conception of a 51% attack is basically entirely correct, except you can't "write whatever trails you want" - you can just selectively ignore particular transactions or double-spend your own transactions at will. Other users' funds cannot be sent without their private keys, no matter how much hashpower you have.
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:23:42

Your entire "Bitcoin is doomed" opinion rests on this paragraph, and this paragraph belies a fundamental misunderstanding and underestimation of Bitcoin.
[Satoshi foresaw mining centralization]( and did not see it as an existential threat to Bitcoin, at all. And it's not, because it's not the distribution of the proof-of-work that is integral; it is the incentives of the participants in that scheme. 
Mining centralization does not fundamentally threaten Bitcoin because if you have a large financial investment into a mining operation, it is in your best interest for the Bitcoin network to work as reliably as possible to maximize the value of your investment.
Granted, there are drawbacks to the centralization of mining, and they merit appropriate consideration, but it is not an apocalyptic development. Furthermore, I haven't seen a proposal which would satisfactorily achieve a guaranteed-to-remain massively-distributed alternative, and I strongly doubt that such a scheme is even possible without sacrificing more than you'd gain by implementing it (e.g. PoS).
In short, I don't think mining centralization will be the death of Bitcoin, because why should it? And ZeroCash's value proposal is entirely unrelated to mining centralization, so why would it even be a potential usurper coin when it doesn't even attempt to address the primary drawback you attribute to Bitcoin? If the reason Bitcoin is doomed is due to the breakdown of the distributedly-mined aspect of it, the only alt coins that would be relevant to consider as replacements would be the ones which are centralization-resistant (hint: none of them).
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:37:31


No, that sounds like a non sequitur to me. Why would you assume this to be the case?
If any given (non-mining) user is completely incapable of self-validation, the defining "peer-to-peer" property of Bitcoin effectively disappears, which arguably renders the entire system moot.


I am not sure what you're referring to here. The network didn't really meaningfully "slow down" towards the end of 2017 (and by no means would an influx of users cause it to do so).


No, not really. The average time between blocks has pretty much always been just under ten minutes; [see this chart]( for a clearer picture of this. Note that [the interval actually slightly *decreased* in late 2017]( contrary to the impression that you currently seem to have.


An increase in total transaction fees does (marginally) contribute to the "incentive to mine" which should rationally lead to more miners coming online... but this effect is likely still somewhat dwarfed by other phenomena (e.g. the macroscopic price discovery Bitcoin is still undergoing, and the still-relatively-large and steadily-dependable block subsidy).


I'm not sure what "issue" you're referring to in this context. Miners continuing to mine is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the blockchain is built by mining). Difficulty increasing is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the higher the difficulty, the more proof-of-work is securing the chain). Transaction fees rising is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the system requires fees to sustain incentives as we evolve and transition from an inflation-based model, and fees only rise if the aggregate demand for transaction confirmation dramatically exceeds available supply [i.e. block space], which means that Bitcoin is succeeding in delivering real value to the world, by definition).


I question the premises that "difficulty rising is bad" and "fees increasing is bad"... the equilibrium state you describe could very well manifest, but I don't personally see these things as objectively desirable or ends unto themselves.


The real problem, in my opinion, boils down to: "Is Bitcoin continuing to function as a peer-to-peer cash system?" If would-be peers on the network (i.e. savers/transactors/users) are unable to afford either **a) making transactions at all** or **b) validating their transactions (and by extension the entire chain)** then Bitcoin is failing to deliver the value it was designed and built to deliver. Some people obsess over **a** but forget about **b** entirely (which is silly, because without **b** there is no value in being able to do **a**, or rather, there is no *added* value to being able to do **a** *with Bitcoin*... and you can always achieve **a** with sensible, layered/stacked engineering *on top of* the bottom layer as long as **b** continues to remain meaningfully possible).
In short, if people can't afford to use Bitcoin in a trust-minimizing manner (which means "run a fully-validating node") then we have a system failure, and have lost the crucial "decentralization" property that made Bitcoin so special.

The lower processing fees are a result of the payment-verification functionality of the network being a distributed process subsidized by block-rewards. A side-effect of this setup (at least with a Proof-of-Work design) is that overall network security is proportional to the total processing power dedicated to the mining process. Meaning WallStCoin would be vastly more vulnerable to a 51% attack and if it handled any serious transaction volume, would certainly be subjected to such.
Though it *is* an interesting idea to entertain a Proof-of-Stake type altcoin in such a role. I could see a government or Wall Street coalition launching some sort of altcoin which relied on Proof-of-Stake or some other design that deviated considerably from a Proof-of-Work scheme, to preclude the possibility of a 51% sabotage or other such network attack.
It'd still be a hard sell alongside Bitcoin, though, which is already out in the wild, performing, and growing exponentially in every direction. 
You raise good points. Well-responded.
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:27:20
You are exactly correct in how to approach this. Buy/cash-out on Coinbase, trade on Gox or Bitstamp or whatever exchange suits your fancy.
It's very easy to get burned by trying to time the market, though; either by losing money directly (missing your guess) or by missing out on potential profits you would have made if you had just been patient and held a little longer. 
You might want to do some reading and research before going through with this sort of stuff. A great resource (and a place I spend a lot of time perusing) is - there's a lot of "noise" in there (newbies just talking about their gut feelings) but there is also some sound logic and analysis if you take the time to find it.
One last tip: I would *not* trade the entire portfolio like what you describe... if you have a total of 15 BTC, consider using something like 5 for day-trading, and keep the rest locked up tight. It minimizes the returns a little bit (if you happen to do things right) but it also mitigates your risk significantly, and you'll experience a lot less "trader's remorse" when things don't go your way.
TL;DR yes, go for it if it's what you want to do, but it's harder than it sounds. You're basically betting that you know more than the market.

The blocksize limit was removed last year, and replaced with a block*weight* limit, specifically a weight limit of 4M WU (weight units). This corresponds to a theoretical limit of 4MB, but a practical limit of 3.7MB.


That limit was removed entirely last year.
Nodes which are running a version prior to 0.13.1 which request blocks that are larger than 1MB will receive a witness-pruned version of the block instead (basically, newer nodes are set up to be able to selectively strip out bytes of witness data on-the-fly when providing block data to older nodes). However, relatively few nodes are running older versions (a little under 3% of the "listening network" at this time), so this feature is relatively esoteric and almost irrelevant by now; for all practical intents and purposes, the 1MB limit is completely gone from modern considerations.
The people who still talk about 1MB limits on Bitcoin are either trolls or misinformed.

I am of the opinion that the pump to 680 was indeed "manipulation" and I believe that it was intended to trigger a bubble if at all possible. I also suspect it was likely performed by the very same entity or entities who have been dumping this past week, pushing things in the opposite direction.
However, I strongly believe you are mistaken when you say that the "pump to 1100" was manipulation by any meaningful usage of the term. Manipulative trading may have contributed to the rise, I'll grant, but at that time there was an actual legitimate influx of new interest and demand. Silk Road Shutdown + China + Google Trends + US Senate Hearings + surprise Norweigian millionaire + mainstream media in general all indicate that a lot more than just a couple of deep pockets were at play, and the rise in price was natural and organic albeit irrationally exuberant, as such spikes tend to be.

My interest in Vertcoin is definitely piqued, but I couldn't find any serious literature on it to help convince myself it's worth anything. [The paper itself]( is sparse in terms of real substantive details. As I understand it, it's basically Litecoin 2.0? What Litecoin was meant to be?

You are absolutely and utterly incorrect to say that I have misrepresented anything here. You will want to re-read my comment. I spoke carefully and truly. Nothing I said contradicted what you are trying to contribute here; I just didn't include a full breakdown because doing so would require far more than a paragraph or two in a reddit comment.
What I *believe* you are driving at (which is difficult to discern because you yourself admit a big lack of understanding here) is that there is no "location of storage" for a Bitcoin and rather just a history of cryptographic signatures dictating the public keys it has been sent to (and thus inherently which private keys have the authority to re-sign and transfer it further). This will eventually lead you to a coinbase transaction where the Bitcoin was mined from, if you follow the chain back to its origin.
How you have convinced yourself that this in any way conflicts with my earlier comment, I have no idea. But no, I'm not wrong here.

Yes, a lot of coins are mined. You know how many the average miner receives during this process? Not thousands or tens of thousands, that's for sure. 
You seem to be mentally skipping the whole "distributed" qualifier of the Bitcoin mining process, and you seem to be imagining a scenario where there are a small number of miners each receiving vast quantities of coins.
There are a relatively small number of *pools*, who distribute their earnings to a very large number of *pool participants*, each of whom receives a great deal less than thousands of coins annually.

You chimed into the conversation saying that the original answers were entirely accurate and that they were not oversimplifications. That was false. I have demonstrated such.
I agree, we *are* having two different conversations. You're trying to dumb Bitcoin down to "sell" it to someone who doesn't understand it. For the record, I don't think anyone should invest in something they don't understand. "I'll tell you about the mechanics and the advanced stuff after we have your capital" is not the way I operate. I'm trying to point out that a reasonable understanding of Bitcoin requires a fair amount of both high-level and low-level knowledge. It does. Of course aspects of it can be simplified, and you didn't do a bad job of most of it (although you did for some reason get rather emotional during the exchange). But the system literally relies on cryptography and hashes and proof-of-work; if you don't know about these things, you don't actually understand much about Bitcoin.
I know these aren't mandatory inclusions in a summary of the protocol. You could literally just say "Bitcoin is internet money" and that is a suitable layman explanation in some contexts. But if the context changes or evolves, also be prepared to get down to the nitty-gritty, or else you end up looking evangelical and irrational rather than levelheaded and intelligent.

So how do we know which accounting ledger is the right one? How do we choose between 2 conflicting accounting ledgers if this system is "distributed"? Who is the authority we consult to determine which is the "right" one and which deserves to be thrown out?

Incorrect. The only way in which the 2% deflation could be occurring is if you have your money strategically invested in a superior instrument of wealth-generation (in this case, Bitcoin). Bitcoin only deflates because demand is growing faster than supply, and that is only happening because it is a superior financial mechanism/network and eliminates transaction-friction.
If you have admitted a 2% deflation-per-year, that means that you've simultaneously admitted 2% of real value-growth-per-year (i.e. productivity) and that Bitcoin realizes and captures this growth by virtue of being a reliable and efficient currency-network.

Well actually if everyone holds, the value skyrockets because poor old supply can't keep up with demand.
Since supply is so stably predictable, if "everyone holds" that means demand is the maximum it could be, and the price (which falls at the intersection of the two) will rise and rise and rise.
The argument "no one spending it will kill it" has never made any sense. At some point there must be an equilibrium where the price of a Bitcoin is high enough to motivate its expenditure.
Hoarding is just the manifestation of ultimate demand for Bitcoin.

4. Running reddit ads (like the infamous Bitcoin wizard one).
5. Crowdfunding sponsorship (just yesterday, I saw considerable brainstorming for what the next thing that the community should attempt to sponsor should be, with ideas ranging from UFC fighters to Indian cricket teams) - also, dogecoiners are helping considerably with this (e.g. NASCAR, water4doge, etc).

That chart is probably the most misleading chart on blockchain.info, in my opinion. It *really* needs to be retitled.
I've never seen the inflation of traditional currencies like the dollar factored in as part of the "cost per transaction" when using cash or credit card to transact. That would be silly. And yet for some reason the inflation of Bitcoin can be considered a transactional cost? Inconsistent at best, malicious misrepresentation at worst.
Block rewards are necessary to ensure a predictable, fair and reasonably consistent distribution of money supply. Their outflow may have a marginal effect on the value of one's holdings, but it's not like any alternatives are inflation-free, so there's no reason to treat Bitcoin inflation as some cost that is unique to Bitcoin.

Your answer, again, is a non-answer. It avoids the question but manages to add one term to the lexicon, therefore only obfuscating the *actual* answer to the underlying question of "why can't we just double-spend, if the tokens are all virtual?"
Don't you see? Neither you nor the parent have managed to *actually* answer the question at all. This is because a meaningful answer cannot be given without explaining the proof-of-work system and the cryptography that legitimizes the network occurences.

I've got it! I found out why you're so obstinate and I think I can finally communicate the insight to you effectively.


Here's what is confusing you! You seem to be under the impression that we need a lot of processing power to perform accounting functions. You're implying (whether you realize it or not) that more processing power for a banking network makes a banking network better or more efficient in some way.
That is where you are very very wrong. You don't need much processing power to handle huge quantities of transactions in traditional centralized systems. A couple nice dedicated servers will do. To be safe, you could use some cloud solutions if you were careful about security. But you certainly don't need hundreds of teraflops per second or anything. You don't need to throw tons of processing power at the problem, so you don't need to create some weird half-blockchain thing and try to invent a scheme where users participate so that you waive their bank fees (and in so doing, sacrificing your revenue model).
The only reason Bitcoin *does* make use of processing power (and "more" *is* "better" in crypto) is because Satoshi decided processing power would be how miners "vote" for their distributed consensus on transaction history. 
The only reason the Bitcoin network needs so many FLOPs and  is the biggest supercomputing network in the world is because the miners are processing as an internal competition, to no avail other than to prevent a single agent from being able to monopolize the arbitration functions. 
Please think about that. Big banks don't need a massive supercomputer network to do their business. It would not help them. Balancing accounts is not particularly CPU-intensive.
Bitcoin uses Proof of Work to *prevent one single agent from gaining meaningful authority over the ledger*. If you grant someone the authority over the ledger from the beginning, you don't need Proof of Work, you don't need lots of processor power, and you certainly don't need a blockchain.


If the goal were to process something that was difficult to process, if the bank for some reason wanted to sequence a genome of something, then perhaps they would have a reason to "trump a centralized system" in terms of raw CPU power thrown at the problem. 


Easy: signals cannot be transmitted instantaneously. If you just need to perform a trivial computing function (e.g. add two numbers together) then doing it all on one chip is going to trump doing anything over a network. Period.
Banks aren't scrambling to "handle all their requests" and they're not buying up computers to keep up with all the transactions they have to assist with. You've accidentally been imagining a fantasy world which has led you to this "centralized blockchain makes sense" absurdism.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:03:06

It still appears you fundamentally don't understand a blockchain. A blockchain is not just a distributed database with universal read-rights, which you're conflating it with. A blockchain is a consensus mechanism.
What you described is a centralized cryptographic transfer protocol, **not** a blockchain.


Blockchains are **not** distributed processors. You are really, really off base here. This is like saying "To you the power of automobiles is a transport function. To me it is the power of language translation." While technically a car *can* be used to drive to another location and get in contact with an agent who can help you translate a given language into another, this conceptualization of the advantage of an automobile betrays an absolutely ridiculous misunderstanding on your part. There are easier and better ways to translate than driving around. 
The analogy isn't perfect but hopefully you get the idea.
Blockchains do *not* give us a new way to distribute the processing of arbitrary programs. They give us a means to agree with each other on a universal ledger, by aligning incentives in a way where it is costly/pointless to deviate from the majority consensus and it can be beneficial to participate honestly. 
You have tried to strip away the incentive structure upon which the blockchain depends, and in so doing you have removed that which makes it a blockchain.
You may have read the whitepaper, but you don't appear to have understood it, unfortunately.
I'm sorry if any of this is coming across as rude. But you really seem to have *no* idea what a blockchain is and why it works and what it achieves. And it is difficult to try to communicate how horribly silly you sound when trying to explain the potential alternative benefits your (wildly off-base) concept of a blockchain confers to its users without seeming rude.

Go look at a random transaction on blockchain.info. There are "inputs" and "outputs" for any given bitcoin transaction (on the left and right, respectively). The inputs are the address(es) where the coin is being sent from; those had to have received bitcoin in the past (either from a coinbase transaction, i.e. they were mined, or from a normal transaction) in order to be able to send them.
One of the outputs is where the bitcoin is being sent to, and one is where leftover coin is being sent (the change address).

I'm not sure why you're so hostile, but you may want to take a deep breath before your comments, friend.
Also, the entire point of Bitcoin was to forgo trust; using already-public and peer-reviewed cryptography is the natural way to implement it.  Not to mention the easiest route to take.

Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses? They cost more, they're slower, they're more dangerous, the gas they run on is harder to procure than hay, and they're confusing!" Of course they are, at first. Technology needs time to mature.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:12:27
Oh, I have predicted that Bitcoin would drop (always temporarily, of course) plenty of times. Always correctly, I might add.
You may not have noticed this, but Bitcoin goes *up* a lot harder than it goes *down*. I can't help it if my (correct) predictions tend to have an upwards bias. But they're certainly not unidirectional.

As I've said, I understand where you were coming from, and I don't begrudge you your actions. All I was trying to do was point out the folly of the "Just post it again later dude" approach, since that ignores the entire issue. No need to take it personally and get defensive, mate. Just trying to show you something you seem to have missed.
To answer your final question: I probably would have locked the thread, notified the OP via PM that he should do his own research when it comes to controversial topics such as Bitcoin, and reached out to the community/moderators in this subreddit to see what could be done about mitigating future such incidents.

Thank you for the link. I read it but it just sounded like business-speak... "We need to do this, this, and this. Let's try and improve yadda-yadda-yadda..."
I don't actually see an outline for a tangible system of improvement, though. Yeah, I get that optimizations need to be made, but where's the solution technically spelled out? Mysteriously absent from the source you linked.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:58:13
Incorrect. SegWit increases the maximum size that blocks can be (it actually replaces the blocksize limit with a block weight limit).
The signature data is still serialized into the block, though it's done in a way such that it can be pruned on the fly when delivering the block to a requesting node broadcasting a version prior to 0.13.1 (which is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the network at this point).
Please do not make comments trying to correct people when you don't understand the subject of discussion at all.

No, not was I was saying at all.
"Applications" as in "uses" - e.g. a payment network, a stock exchange platform, a spam-prevention device, a network upon which DACs can propagate, etc.
"Limitations" as in "roles or use-cases it is not capable of efficiently  performing" - e.g. a physical transportation device, a means of starting fires, a way to compel pandas to procreate, a cure for cancer, etc.
In no way was I referring to legislation or government regulation. I was talking about the public assessment of the abilities of the Bitcoin network/protocol, and the resultant calming-down of the speculation as to the ultimate equilibrium price point. Hope this clarifies.

I'm willing to bet this was the course of events:
Journalist finds some guy named "Satoshi Nakamoto" who is kind-of-nerdy and probably-senile. Bonus: he worked on confidential projects in his past, so he will (at some point) respond to a question about his prior work with "I can't talk about it."
Reporter goes to guy's driveway. Guy confusedly responds "I can't talk about it" as expected.
Reporter writes piece and sensationalizes it as if she's proven the identity of the creator of Bitcoin.

You are very much mistaken. It appears you still do not understand what Bitcoin is.
If you could not "figure out the Bitcoin address for a private key until 2011" then Bitcoin could not be used, at all, prior to that. You need to do some reading/research and a good deal of critical thinking. 
Unless you are indeed being sarcastic, as another user has suggested. I do not get that vibe from your replies though.

No, she is a liar.
If I have a hunch and state it as a fact, and make no allowances about the prospect that my guess might be wrong, I am deceiving my audience. Furthermore, if I do so through a "reputable" publication like Newsweek (a front-page story, to boot) with the knowledge that this will be re-published and that my allegations (and the phrasing thereof) will be repeated and believed, it is not an exaggeration to call me a liar. 
Leah McGrath is a liar.

Your "zero sum game" point would only hold true if the total supply of all goods and services were static and stagnant. 
Economic output grows. Increased efficiency is realized. Overall supply increases, and I would argue it increases at a faster rate than the population.
So holding onto wealth (what you would likely dub "hoarding") is, or rather should be, a viable strategy to increase your own purchasing power *without decreasing your fellow Man's*. This is a crucial insight to make, and once you do indeed understand that every iota of value earned over time does not equal an iota "stolen" from another economic participant, you will begin to understand a lot more, a lot more profoundly.

The question when it comes to altcoins is: what does this coin offer that Bitcoin does not already?
So far, the *only* answers I've ever seen to that question have been:
* Proof-of-stake - which I think is a bad idea.
* ASIC-resistance - which Litecoin apparently botched with its poor Scrypt implementation and Vertcoin may or may not have solved (I'm personally unconvinced on the matter)
* a sense of humor - dogecoin, and to a lesser extent, coinye
The only alt that I hold currently is a little bit of doge, if that tells you anything. And that's just as much for laughs as it is for profit.
It is right to be skeptical of altcoins, because there is no real reason for an altcoin to exist unless it is superior to Bitcoin in some way (and so far, frankly, they're not).
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:53:22
No one is saying "Bitcoin is science" literally; it is an analogy.

I also thought the November bubble was going to go well past $250. 
I also thought Chinese regulations would be the most likely thing to put and end to the rally and pop the bubble.
I also thought/think Wall Street was going to start moving towards Bitcoin in 2014.
I also thought Gox was going to implode.
I also thought storing bitcoins there was a stupid decision. 
I also thought Gox's excuse of how their woes were entirely due to Transaction Malleability was bunk.
I also thought Dorian Nakamoto was absolutely not the real Satoshi.
I think a lot of things in the Bitcoin space, and when I think something strongly I am verbal about it. I am on record saying all of these things either before or as soon as they were first being discussed. Go through my reddit comment history if you want, going back to about August 2013. 
I think 2 more things: 
1) We're going to see another bubble before 2014 is over, cruising **well** past the old ATH.
2) The admins of the Silk Road 2.0 are currently robbing their users as they pay them back with the money they already robbed them of.

*Any* choice of unit supply is going to be arbitrary. There is no "correct" number of units, because the units are essentially infinitely divisible and the whole system relies on the scarcity of the units within.
21 million is just as good as 100 million or 10 thousand or whatever you want. In practice, *it does not matter what the number is,* and what is more, *there is no number that it ought to be*.

No. It is fairly evident you do not understand the mechanics here. Provided that the source of entropy used in the generation of the private key is sound (and it is, in any reputable client) the "brute force" and "2 computers randomly generating identical private key" scenarios are mathematically identical. In fact, the brute force scenario has a vastly, vastly, vastly higher probability of this occurring simply by virtue of the fact that the attempts are so much more numerous.
I apologize here, but it doesn't seem like you grasp what you're talking about enough to have a meaningful exchange on the matter.

No. Satoshi definitely expected it to take off. He continually reminded the community that the project was in its infancy. He is quoted as saying "It might make sense to buy a couple, just in case it takes off..." 
He hasn't spent any of the original coins he has allegedly mined. It is absolutely idiotic to try and say he didn't anticipate Bitcoin growing like it has.

Then you're very likely using a different definition of the word "sell" than @_date: 2014-01-13 00:57:30
If you hold 1% of the peercoins in existence, you get 1% of the proof-of-stake rewards.
Meanwhile, your neighbor, who could only afford 0.1% of the peercoins in existence (relative to you, he is poorer) will only receive 0.1% of the PoS rewards.

Assuming Bitcoin continues to experience deflation (which the entire argument against it being a viable currency appears based upon), it is a form of money which appreciates in value over time. It therefore makes sense as an investment, and a rational thing to do would be to buy Bitcoin. If everyone thinks this way, the prophecy basically self-fulfills: demand for Bitcoin continues to compound while supply tapers; price rises.
One important quality of this "investment" is that it is very easy to transfer to other people who want it, should you wish to confer it upon them. Perhaps the easiest mechanism in the world to do exactly that.
So granting all of this, what do you ultimately have? A token which people desire for its profitability, which can be traded frictionlessly as unique individuals' demand for the tokens fluctuates everywhere. 
That's money. 
It works because there's going to be people who want that sliver-of-a-Bitcoin more than you do, so they'll barter for it (either with goods, services, or other tender). Eventually everyone has a "selling point" and the returns on your excess savings can and should be thought of as capital gains for an intelligent investment kept well-secured.

I was hoping the sarcasm would help to communicate the point, which is that Bitcoin is not a classical entity e.g. "a currency" or "a stock" or "a commodity" but rather some new sort of hybrid. Whenever someone says something like "well then doesn't that undermine it as a currency [which is the entire reason it is useful or has value in the first place]?" the questioner should stop their current line of reasoning, which is entirely based on semantics, and reconsider.

To be entirely fair...
1) He appears to have just rattled off 15 quick and dirty benefits off the top of his head. He certainly rose to the challenge you presented.
2) Receipt of Bitcoin is free. You can create an address with open source software and anyone interested in paying or donating bits to you can do so with zero or very-close-to-zero fees. This is not so with bank accounts in most cases.
3) Although you're right in some respects about being able to "send fiat 24/7", a lot of bank activities are not actually 24/7 and it's disingenuous to imply that they are. Bitcoin, by contrast, never sleeps.
4) You can't always send fiat anywhere you want... a perfect example of this is the banking blockade against Wikileaks in 2010. Bitcoin circumvents such capital controls; this is a fact and a benefit of it which can't reasonably be denied.
5) On many national borders, it is absolutely false to say that you can transport large amounts of fiat without dealing with a variety of issues. You certainly can't memorize a seed and bring your wealth over borders in your own mind with fiat.
6) You may not see anonymity or decentralization as primary driving forces for mass adoption, but the challenge was to list 15 benefits of Bitcoin (or problems it solves) and there's no legitimate reason to disqualify these aspects.
7) Insulting to who, exactly?

Absolutely an oversimplification. The price of Bitcoin (as with any commodity) is at the intersection of supply and demand. Electricity forms a floor, but does not determine price directly. 
Thank you, come again.
And not to mention...


This doesn't really answer "how come they can't be counterfeited" to a layman asking the question. It is basically a hand-wave. The full and thorough answer would involve an in-depth exposition of cryptography and its application in reference to the blockchain, and a few details explaining the concept of "proof of work" and how the consensus-based protocol uses this.
On a second read-through, I realize these are not just gross oversimplifications, they actually manage *not* to answer the questions. 
What is with this contrarian attitude here? My point was never "you don't understand Bitcoin" as you seem to be interpreting it to be. It was rather "Bitcoin is a big topic that can be confusing by virtue of its complexity, and curious investigators can quickly drill into it  to find more nuances than a one-sentence summary could ever hope to include"!

It doesn't matter for day-to-day transactions, no.
The only reason it "matters" is if you think it's unfair for certain privileged people to create "money" out of thin air, which is effectively taxing the general populace by decreasing the value of any money saved by them. In other words, if you don't like the whole "1% of people (who really don't produce anything of value for society) own more wealth than the other 99%" paradigm.

How do 51% of ledgers say x, though? Wouldn't each individual ledger in a distributed system be incentivized to say that "all x belong to me"? 
See, I get that once the majority decrees something, it is so. But how do we get the majority to agree if every individual actor is greedy? 
You're hand-waving the important part of the question away! Am I to assume "Bitcoin works by magic"? Or will you just explain it to me?

Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses?

Right, but your entire response here is just "I'm not just talking about Bitcoin" when that is tangential at best and irrelevant at worst to the point I was making. 
In short, you're ignoring the meat of my comment. I'm saying that the only way deflation is possible is if the mechanism through which it manifests is a superior investment to other forms of wealth. 
If Bitcoin is growing faster than the other parts of the economy, it is the right thing to do to buy and hold Bitcoin. That's investment, not hoarding. And as soon as that's not true (i.e. other forms of investments yield higher returns) then it makes sense to move the funding to those new opportunities. 
In other words, your argument is void. *This* is the point I'm making.

A valid caveat. It depends on what you mean by "bad", of course. As a consumer holding Bitcoin (or any other monetary asset), then of course from my microscopic perspective a high rate of deflation is very very good and desirable. 
For the economy as a whole, when this asset is commonly used as a unit of account, yes, I would say that a high rate of either inflation or deflation is undesirable. In that, you are assuredly correct.
Since the Bitcoin monetary base is actually inflationary for quite some time yet, though, it should not necessarily remain highly deflationary past the price-discovery phase, while the markets violently move to find what a "fair value" for the coins are. 
Of course we cannot know for sure until we see it happen in real life, it is possible that in the next few years, Bitcoin should establish a recognizable set of applications and limitations, which will help to stabilize the (hitherto wildly fluctuating) market expectations regarding it. If and when that happens, the price should stabilize as a result, at least until the markets are exposed to fundamental changes regarding these expectations/assumptions.
Basically, my personal theory is that the super-high-rate of deflation Bitcoin is experiencing (has experienced) is a symptom of its youth and inherent complexity. These combine in a way to make it difficult to definitively assess what the network is "worth", and the only way to come to a real conclusion on the matter is to watch it develop and grow and realize its potential. Once the world sees and understands what it is capable of (and what it is not) to a higher degree, the price movements should drop dramatically in percentage terms because of the nature of free markets. Which would leave us with a mildly deflationary or inflationary coin, depending on which timeframe we're discussing.

Let me clear this up for you: it hasn't resulted in any theft from the SR2.0
You very clearly do not understand TM if you think it can result in magical Bitcoin theft. The only way in which it could result in theft is if a human admin (or a horrendously coded, and I mean **stupendously horrendously coded**, automated process) with control of funds manually republished withdrawal transactions based only on the txid not matching in an internal database, with 0 checks against the blocks' hashes on the blockchain.
How you managed to interpret my comment as "transaction malleability is not a thing" is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:03:34
The times when Bitcoin is rising in value the most dramatically, expenditures in it increase too.
I'm really sorry to break it to you, but the models you were taught are being proven wrong. The wealth effect and time value of money are important psychological factors and as I said before, we are now watching the hypotheses that you entertain regarding deflation be empirically disproven. 
You can argue all you want and try busting out whatever logic you feel like, but the facts are all on my side here. I'm referencing **real-world occurences** and explaining them with my model. You are using a model that causes you to predict things that are, in fact, not happening. Reality is on my side.

Then again, it's much "cooler" to just pop in and say "I am not Dorian Nakamoto." than it is to publish a properly signed message.
Also, the ambiguity of "is it really him?" helps to prevent people from obsessing over tracking him down.
Even if it *was* signed by a Satoshi PGP key, doubters could allege that the key had since been compromised in some way. There still wouldn't be "proof" it was him.
I'd bet it was Satoshi, and that he considered signing the message but ultimately decided it was safer not to. Of course, I could be wrong.

The rest of us are talking about Bitcoin. If you ever want to have a meaningful discussion, you know where to find us. In fact, you're already in the subreddit you need to be. So far you're kind of wanking it in the corner to a spherical cow in a vacuum while we discuss actual logistics of real-life.
Incidentally, Bitcoin is definitely being used for transactions. You can keep whispering whatever you want to yourself before you go to sleep, but transactions can and do occur every minute of every day whether you acknowledge them or not. When discussing the lower boundary for the value per Bitcoin as determined by the transactional practicality of the network, it renders your analysis moot when you change every other variable to something that it's not. "Well what if there were infinite bitcoins?" There aren't. "What if it was trivial to buy/sell large amounts regularly outside of an exchange?" It isn't. "What if humans weren't greedy?" They are.
No one is talking about ImaginaryCoin in a world-without-greed that operates without exchanges. Except for you, for some reason.

The invention of money in the first place was to provide a universal unit of account and exchange mechanism that was accepted by as many participants as possible. You're describing a huge step backwards, not forward progress.

Every single user *would* mess with the blockchain if they could, to give themselves more bitcoins. If bitcoins are valuable, why shouldn't we?
The *actual* answer (which I'm not sure you know, but I'll help to educate you if not) lies in proof-of-work. The longest chain of hashes that satisfy the protocol's current difficulty-threshold represents the authoritative ledger to which you refer. The only way to extend this chain is to input the time and processor-power to finding a satisfactory nonce for the next hash. 
This is the portion that you are leaving unexplained (either because you don't understand it yourself or you are incapable of explaining it simply). Without it, Bitcoin **does not work.** I do not have to be a software engineer to be able to point out the flaw of the Bitcoin network sans proof-of-work, I just have to be reasonably intelligent. So far in all of your responses, when I've narrowed down the crux of the issue, you have said "it's the software in the background" or other such non-answers. Basically, if I may paraphrase, you say "it's fancy computer magic that makes this work" and act like that's a satisfactory response. It's not. Otherwise the Bitcoin whitepaper would not exist.
When someone continues to ask more and more in-depth questions into a complex topic, it is not a suitable response to call them retarded and hurl profanity at them and claim "you've answered their question 5 times" when really you had neglected to mention the crucial ingredient that *allows the protocol to function in the first place* (namely, proof-of-work). If you are unable to answer it, take it as a mark of your own inadequate level of understanding and do further research until you *can* provide a more-serious answer than "because the software does it". 
There is no reason to be angry here, and I am by no means trolling. I hope I've gotten a little bit of my point across here; analogies can certainly help with surface-level layman inquiries, but if someone asks actual questions eventually you should try and respond with actual answers (if you can).

It's *absolutely* relevant to PoS. His entire point is that the web-of-trust is replicable on the Bitcoin protocol. It's not extant yet, and no one is arguing that it is. The idea is that it's possible (and looking likely to emerge). 
Sure, there are compromises that will be made during the process. No one expects Bitcoin to look the same in 5 years. It can't. 
But it forms the backbone of a system that has numerous advantages over the status quo, and thus has the potential to do more, more efficiently, than that which our systems are currently capable of, and you seem to be *trying* not to acknowledge this.

Sorry to keep bombarding you with updates, but I wanted to mention one last caveat (since this is probably the least hostile exchange I've had with a regular of your subreddit): when the block rewards dwindle and approach zero, most of the points I've expounded in this conversation are rendered less and less true or relevant. So in the long term, the transaction-processing-expenditures *do* present a serious drawback to the Bitcoin network. I want to show that I acknowledge this, and it is a valid criticism and should not be dismissed.
For at least another decade, though, these criticisms seem to fall flat in my eyes.

Are you kidding? That's like the one thing that *doesn't* identify them with any certainty.
The winning bidder(s) could publicly move the coins to a particular address after having them transferred to them upon winning the auction, to prove ownership, a la Mt.Gox or BitStamp when they have shifted coins around to prove solvency.
There could be a FOIA appeal to the USMS which is honored.
The USMS could just decide to publicize who the winners are.
The USMS could accidentally let slip who the winners are, just like they accidentally CC'd the recipients of the email instead of BCC'd them. In fact, this could happen in a number of different ways. They could even (accidentally or purposefully) attach a note to one or more transactions on blockchain.info like they did when initially transferring the seized coins out of the Silk Road, to keep track of them or tag them while moving them around.
The information could leak, and the mole or leaker could manage to wrangle together proof of the legitimacy of the leak in a variety of different ways, just like Snowden did with the NSA.
A mistake could occur at some stage in the process which results court proceedings in which the information plays a part of the case and is thus made public.
I could honestly keep going for a while, but this should be more than enough to get your juices flowing, hopefully. You have to have zero imagination to think there's no way this information could credibly be publicized and verified. I'm boggled that you even asked for elaboration here.

It sounds bad if you phrase it like that, because it sounds like some person or entity is paying $1.8M to make sure these transactions are being processed. That's disingenuous, though. No one individual or organization is paying that. 
The expenditure is still there, in the form of people buying and using hardware like ASICs in order to compete for the block rewards, but they are not paying that money to verify transactions (which was ingeniously bundled into the mining process); they are paying money on hardware as a speculative bet that they will be able to profit from selling or using the block rewards such effort will net them. 
So really that money isn't being "spent"; it's being "speculated" by miners in a distributed fashion.
And once again, this is all part of the mining process, which has a parallel in fiat systems: minting or expansion of the money supply through Federal Reserve actions. So if you want to lambast this expenditure as a fault of Bitcoin then in all fairness the fiat alternatives deserve the same (or at least similar) criticism. And at risk of repeating myself, the block rewards are at least available to anyone who cares to make a grab for them. Alternative systems of inflation do not permit similarly competitive access to freshly-created funds.

They are under no obligation to release information for what their bid amount was. The only way we would know what they bought them for is if they told us (or started dumping, which would be a big clue).
They would rationally want to keep it secret if they bought for lower-than-face-value prices. They would likely only publicize their bid if it were higher than the going rate (to encourage the markets to rise).
I do not think they will lose money at all. The highest bidder will likely, if paying a premium, publicize this in an attempt to spark a rally. 
If they *could* get them for cheaper than on the exchanges, they would arbitrage, without hesitation. You **always** arbitrage if you can.

Just to be clear, I have nothing but respect for you and your insights, so if I come off as argumentative in this exchange I apologize (it's an unfortunate tendency of mine).
I definitely agree that Bitcoin begs a serious reassessment of definitions and perspectives when it comes to financial terminology. And the game theory absolutely depends on the rewards that incent the network security. But with that said, I really don't see how the block rewards can be construed as a transactional cost; not even an implied one.
I could hypothetically buy ten bitcoins tonight and send each of them to ten friends in different states or countries, who promptly spend them on NewEgg for their Christmas shopping, and pay 0 fees  for the privilege of doing so. If I did so, I would have used the Bitcoin network for ten separate transactions and incurred nothing by way of fees in the process. You can't really argue that the blocks created in that timeframe constituted any sort of fee to me, implied or explicit. 
I think it's inconsistent (and frankly not very smart) to dub the block rewards as some sort of fee. They're not. They're a cleverly-deployed inflationary mechanism that play a vital role in securing the network, but not a fee by any meaningful usage of the term.
Also, consider the following: if Bitstamp decides to arbitrarily shuffle their holdings around, juggling trillions of bits for no reason at all, they would increase the number of transactions processed by the network a great deal, and in so doing reduce the "Cost per Transaction" figures greatly. Yet nothing would actually change from any of our perspectives; Bitcoin wouldn't be magically cheaper to use at all.
If that doesn't demonstrate how bogus of a metric the "cost per transaction" graph depicts, I don't know what will.

You don't seem to understand. Contract law is *not* a guarantee that you'll get what you are due. On the other hand, if you have a bitcoin, you are *guaranteed* full access and control of that coin. The only parallel would be like holding physical gold or cash in your hand. Otherwise, you're reliant on someone to provide you the asset you are due. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:30:44
You are confused. The exchange rate of Bitcoin rising is functionally isomorphic to the price of goods and services dropping in relation to Bitcoin.
Me being able to get more dollars per BTC is exactly equivalent to me being able to get more goods/services per BTC. Hence, the coins are price deflationary.

This is comically wrong.
"He" didn't pay for this. Other people bid through his syndicate, so he loses no face if they bid the most and won the coins, i.e. "overpaid" to use your terminology.
Publicizing that they won the coins and paid a premium for them would make the most sense because this would be a newsworthy event and send a market-signal that the coins on the exchanges currently are being undervalued in the Big Boy World. This would naturally spur things upward and certainly would not create downward pressure on the price, which would in turn help to prop up the value of SM's existing holdings (some 150,000 BTC or so).
You're not thinking like a moneymaker. You think Silbert would worry about the syndicate "looking silly" when the effect of publicizing that they won the coins would likely create upwards momentum for Bitcoin? That's just bad logic.

@_date: 2014-05-08 02:38:24
I haven't said much here. It's not *my* argument. I do, incidentally, believe Bitcoin is awesome, but that's not what I've said.
What I've done is point to *others'* arguments in favor of Bitcoin continuing to grow as it historically has done; namely, it is a technology and the rate of technological diffusion tends to follow that lovely S curve. The unique characteristic of Bitcoin is that it directly links **value** to this adoption.
Now, why should the technology be adopted? See Exhibit B above. By really any metric or standard by which money can be judged, Bitcoin is superior to what forms preceded it.
These are not ideas that originated from me. I merely recognize their strength and historical accuracy. I have searched high and low to find an adequate rebuttal to the supposition that this (entirely logical) rise and rise will continue until the technology is truly "adopted" and I have yet to see one surface. Based on this information, I made an investment quite some time ago that has fared better than almost any other alternative investment could have during that period. In short, I thought things through, reached a conclusion, and put my money where my mouth was. This took me a little over 6 months to thoroughly consider and commit to.
Since I have made the aforementioned commitment, I have continued to try and find an adequate rebuttal to my conclusion or the logic involved to reach it. I have found none. The *very best argument* I've ever encountered is "it doesn't have to keep doing what it keeps doing!" and forgive me my insolence in disregarding that vapid excuse for an argument.
I would be quite happy to hear a valid argument against the inevitable growth of BTC. If strong enough, it would convince me to withdraw the rest of my holdings and count myself fortunate to have yielded such magnificent returns while the opportunity existed. To this day, no one has been able to rise to the challenge. In fact, no one has come close. The trolls are just that: trolls. And fortunately I have my profits to help me sleep at night, while they have nothing but bitter jealousy.
The onus is no longer on me to prove why this works. That was what that 6 months of fervent research and analysis was for. The onus is now on the detractors to spell out, specifically, why it will stop following the pattern that I can very clearly recognize that it is following (and even explain why it does so). 
In other words, (and bear in mind that this is not directed at you, specifically, dear redditor): until you can form a real rebuttal, keep your mouth shut, trolls.

You're asking a lot of questions and it's pretty evident you've made up your mind on most of the answers, but I will still do my best to correct your misconceptions and provide correct answers.


Universal access and redundancy.


This has nothing to do with distributed databases. Computer hardware is an entirely distinct issue.


To make efficient use of the processing resources of distinct machines and distribute up the processing of our work (allocate it among different nodes).


To optimize the runtimes of programs by allowing them to perform their work asynchronously.
Not a single thing you listed is relevant to the operation of a blockchain. You're mainly referencing performance increases that result from the intelligent division of processing among distributed nodes. Stuff like mapreduce.
That is not *at all* what the blockchain does or is used for. A blockchain is a distributed means of achieving consensus among multiple nodes that do not necessarily trust one another. It requires a great deal of work and effort to be done to preserve this consensus, and that is the exact *opposite* effect of the one that all your irrelevant examples achieve.
You do not seem to understand a blockchain, on a fundamental level. You're drawing hasty conclusions from an erroneous interpretation of a system, and trying to draw misguided parallels to other network/computing innovations where none are warranted. 
I repeat: there is **no** advantage whatsoever to a blockchain if you do not need distributed consensus. That is what a blockchain is a solution for. In a centralized system, you need no distributed consensus because by its very nature it is centralized; the consensus achieves nothing that the central actor cannot. 
My primary suggestion to you, if you're interested in clearing up your misconceptions, is to read the whitepaper. If you have already, read it again and make sure you fully comprehend what exactly it is saying. Once you do, you'll understand why everything you've said is basically uninformed gibberish.


Yes, I did. If you entered a conversation by saying "we can use cows as airplanes" and went on to draw conclusions from your cow-airplane premise, then me saying "This makes no sense" is an entirely sufficient rebuttal. The same holds true in this case.

@_date: 2014-04-20 18:39:16
The premise of cryptocurrencies is that you don't need to rely on governmental monetary policy to achieve anything.
*After* the blockchain technology had sufficiently saturated the market and extreme or rapid influxes of demand stopped hitting Bitcoin every few months, theoretically the rate of price-deflation achieved by a Bitcoin economy would be equal to the rate of economic growth minus the rate of monetary inflation achieved through the mining process (keep in mind that the monetary base of Bitcoin is *inflationary* and will remain so for over a century).
If Bitcoin continues to be deflationary after the technology has been fully adopted, that means the economy is growing healthily. Which means all the doomsday arguments against deflation are wrong. If the economy is not growing healthily due to the falling prices and rising cost of capital, then Bitcoin should not be deflationary any more (demand having peaked while supply continues to increase)... and those very same arguments are no longer relevant because Bitcoin is not deflationary any more.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:52:52
Yes. Miners can include whatever transactions they want in their blocks. That's their prerogative.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:50:34
From the [Bitcoin wiki FAQ](


From [the Litecoin page of the wiki](


If you wait for 24 confirmations instead of 6, Litecoin is no easier to double-spend on than Bitcoin. But there's no "something for nothing"; the faster confirmation time means that you need more confirmations in order to trust that any transaction is irreversible.
Saying it's "easier to 51% attack" may have been a stretch, although to be honest, I believe this, too. Because even though there aren't ASICs for Litecoin (yet), it would cost me a far smaller sum of money to build up a server farm to mine the shit out of Litecoins than it would to manufacture enough ASICs to make a splash in the Bitcoin world.

One interesting point that isn't explained in detail a lot is that though a miner requires a connection to a network-facing node to broadcast its blocks, nodes are not the same thing as miners. I'm sure if you were aware of this already, but it seems worth mentioning.
A node gathers and validates transactions, while a miner actually selects a chunk of these transactions, performs the proof of work (hashing) and creates new blocks (thereby earning the block reward / creating new coins). Nodes aren't really incentivized like miners are.
But regardless of that little factoid, to get back to the later questions you asked, when all the coins are mined, nodes continue to gather and validate transactions. Miners continue to include these transactions in blocks to receive the fees included with them, so they would indeed continue to mine / hash / generate blocks. The only difference is that the coinbase reward of these blocks would be set to 0.
Is the system sustainable (or desirable versus alternatives) off of fees alone, though? I have no idea. It sounds like it will work to me, but I'm an optimist.

They are not mutually exclusive and Bitcoin is both. Your point is unfortunately founded on a very flawed premise.
It's like asking if an automobile is something to sit in or something that moves. It's both at the same time, and just because you never encountered a chair which also aided in travel doesn't mean that such is impossible.
You only think those things are opposites because you've never seen an example of something that is both. Until Bitcoin, of course.
Try to reassess things without bias and you'll see there is nothing definitionally preclusive about an asset like Bitcoin being both a currency and a speculative investment.

Fire up an older node, from before August 2017. Let it sync to the tip of the chain. It will automatically follow the real Bitcoin.
You don't have to "do your best to interpret things" because the software will do it for you; in fact, that's pretty much *the value of Bitcoin* in a nutshell.
If you'd like to adhere to the whitepaper definition of Bitcoin instead, *guess what*, it's still the real Bitcoin. Altcoins (like BCH) don't have enough cumulative work to even come *close* to qualifying as actual Bitcoin. The only reason BCH is able to survive is because they introduced *decidedly* non-Bitcoin consensus rules (the EDA) to get around the chain outright disappearing.
If you'd rather define things according to the economic majority, you *still* wind up defining Bitcoin as Bitcoin.
If you'd rather appeal to "Satoshi's vision", you *still* reach the same conclusion (unless you're dishonest or misinformed).
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and it uses the ticker BTC. Any meaningful definition of the term leads to this.

In every metric by which money and the efficiency thereof can be judged, cryptocurrency is superior to the incumbent mechanisms. 
Of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is far-and-away the leader, and a strong argument can be made that the network effect, combined with the economic incentive structure of wealth protection that Bitcoin employs, combined with the open-source dynamic nature of the underlying model, ultimately renders this role incredibly difficult to usurp directly.
So, if crypto really is better money, and it really does remain the King of Crypto, Bitcoin's success begins to seem more and more inevitable. Which portion of the above argument do you question, and why? Please be as explicit as possible.

This leaves us with "launder it" - i.e. convert to Darkcoins or put it through a mixing service. And you are very much overestimating the volume capacity these services can reasonably handle.

One of the biggest distinctions between Bitcoin and other forms of money is the predictability of the scarcity of Bitcoin. As evidenced by the text embedded into the Genesis Block, it is likely that arbitrary inflationary influxes introduced by central monetary authorities were one of the primary motivating forces behind striving for and working to build a (hopefully ultimately superior) alternative.
When governments print more money to stimulate their floundering economies it is a direct and obvious contrast against Bitcoin. 
This is pretty clearly relevant to Bitcoin.

Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses?

I've spotted the problem. You seem to be under the impression that what "the blockchain" achieves is an efficient database system.
This is very, very, very untrue. It belies a great misunderstanding of the concept, which is why you're having trouble seeing eye-to-eye with others here.
What a blockchain achieves is **not** an efficient database backend. It instead achieves distributed consensus, *at the cost of efficiency*. 
In other words, if you're a central authority (in your example, the bank), using a blockchain makes **no sense whatsoever** when a central database achieves the same job and is much less expensive to maintain, support, store, etc.
Once again, to reiterate (because it is very important that you understand this point, so you realize why what you're saying doesn't make sense): **a centralized blockchain does not make any sense; it confers no advantages nor benefits and actually would bring numerous disadvantages and unnecessary costs to deploy and preserve**.
If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:17:41
Well first off I'm not necessarily referring to just centralized mining, but for the sake of simplicity let's consider that alone for the moment.
GHash.io (or any other entity that gets a high enough hash rate) could essentially fork Bitcoin and pick which fork is authoritative with their hashing power. This would certainly be a form of control, albeit still preferable to the unchecked control of the Federal Reserve and co. They allegedly control a large portion of their own mining hardware through their cloud contracting scheme, so in the worst case scenario they'd be able to manage such a stranglehold even without external miners contributing to their pool.
Granted, the community could probably figure out a way to operate on the non-GHash fork, but it would be tricky and costly to figure out a reasonable way of doing so. Let us hope it never comes to that. Personally I suspect it won't, but it's not ridiculously far-fetched or unfathomable by any means.

Assuming he is an individual, yes, *obviously* he is a very, very, **very** unique individual. He invented Bitcoin! That should go without saying.


He *is* fabulously wealthy.


Ummmm, why? Gonna try backing that up, or is your argument essentially "other people do it lol!"?


What?! No, he hasn't. He's had millions of dollars to his name this entire time. He's a millionaire if bitcoins are a buck apiece. 
Plus you don't know what his non-bitcoin assets amount to. Plus you don't even know whether he's cashed any out; if I were him I would cash out my most-recently-acquired coins first, so as to avoid my identity being discovered through blockchain analysis. There is literally *no evidence whatsoever* that he has not done exactly this.

...which would require aforementioned steel-balls.
Satoshi clearly expects Bitcoin to keep growing. He directly indicated his understanding of the vast potential of his invention in numerous quotes. He demonstrated peerless levels of prescience with his every action and statement. Bitcoin has been subjected to no greater dangers in the past year than it was subjected to (and survived) in years prior. At no point did Satoshi ever give any evidence that he would "spook" and it is barely conceivable that he would burn his private keys without telling anyone for the lulz.

You raise a good point and argue it very well, but unfortunately you also veered off into false-dichotomy-land towards the end of your comment.


The important thing to realize is that "distributing money to good internetting" meme will only ever work if it becomes a widespread phenomenon and a significant chunk of the online population starts participating. As it is, Bitcoin is fairly niche, so if it's only this little community who are tipping content creators for their work, things will only go so far.
Conversely, if Bitcoin is promoted in the process, there is a possibility the community grows, the sphere expands, and the revolution in online interactions begins to stand a real chance.
In other words, the Bitcoin community isn't big enough yet to financially back the microtransaction revolution with their tips. The only way such a thing could really take off would be if the community grows... so the primary function of the service is twofold, and your false dichotomy can be discarded.

This made me laugh.
Look at the price charts yourself. To call the value "in freefall" is a bit of an exaggeration.
Historically, the Bitcoin value always bleeds out scarily in between Hype Cycles, losing anywhere from 20-95% of its peak figure. The thing is, these bleedouts have historically always remained *above* the previous Hype-Cycle's peak figure, because during any given Hype Cycle the value rockets up thousands or tens of thousands of percent. 
Of course, there's no guarantee that another Hype Cycle will occur. A strong case can be made that one (or multiple) will, and I have yet to see an intelligent or convincing case be made for why this pattern would suddenly stop happening, but as always past performance is no surefire guarantee of future results. You have to research, think critically, and form your own conclusions.
If you don't believe Bitcoin will go up in value, then don't buy any, but *definitely* don't try to make money mining Bitcoin. That would be stupid beyond words.

I may be a bit confused here. You can surely see the ratings of a particular seller without paying any fees, correct? And then once you  meet them you can just give them any old Bitcoin address and trade outside Mycelium. Surely everyone would piggyback off the service but not give up their fees with no need to, right?
Do you mean the only way to leave feedback on a buyer/seller in the first place is to make a Mycelium trade? 
If that's the case, it sounds like the feedback system is almost an advertising ring. You're basically paying to build your profile. I suppose it could work, and 0.5% ain't too bad at all, but as an end user I'd still probably personally sit it out as a free-rider. In other words, if people did end up establishing legit reviews/credentials that I could view, I'd opt to have them trade outside the client when we met in person just to save a buck.
At least at this stage, the people involved in Bitcoin are relatively tech-savvy, and I feel many would do the same and bypass any fees they could, just by virtue of the ability to do so. 
If the client is nice enough, though, I could see people using it and "supporting" it by opting to trade within it. I suppose that could work, though it's a bold business-model. It raises the standard of just how *good* the app has to be.

@_date: 2014-03-13 16:43:22
Great comment. Let me address this, though, since you seem to have overlooked something crucial:


Deflation cannot "reward non-productive hoarders" because *the money itself confers no benefits upon the holder until it is spent.* There are no **rewards** until you **spend your coins**. And once you do, they're back in the economy, circulating and no longer yielding you wealth-returns.
That's the beauty of Bitcoin, and why deflation is not some nasty bogeyman waiting to ruin our lives.
"Hoarding" is just a negatively-connoted term that boils down to "saving" and in all honesty, "hoard" should never really be used to refer to money. If you earned/acquired money, you are free to do with it what you wish. No one should be able to tell you how or when you should spend it, and if you want to hold onto it for a future date or occasion, you should not be punished for your patience.
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:20:46

@_date: 2014-01-06 08:52:16


There is not a definitive answer to this question, of course, but my personal take is "no, this doesn't limit it at all!"
The only real rational reason for hoarding bitcoins is if you expect them to appreciate in value. As soon as you no longer believe this to be true, you have no incentive to preserve those bitcoins and you should spend them in exchange for other goods or currencies. In other words, people who hoard btc are a source of demand but not supply; they will actually contribute to the increase in btc valuation that they are hoping will take place.
At some point in this process the system should balance itself out. Either bitcoins are appreciating in value but not being spent (sweet for those who own them) or they're not appreciating enough and *do* get spent (making it a wonderful new functional global currency). You can't have it both ways, which is what is implicitly being assumed in your "paradox" description.


No, again: if bitcoins are rising in value, there is **more** incentive for merchants to accept them and keep them and convince consumers to pay with them. Merchants/vendors are people, too. They want those same returns. 
Again, this should mean an increase in demand while supply remains steadily predictable; this is how the value rises.
There is no paradox. Just a really elegant but really intricate and confusing balance of economic incentives rolled into an ingenious new protocol/engine.

You're nitpicking. The fact of the matter is that for most (non-big-ticket) purchases, people don't read the fine print in the contracts. There are even legal rulings acknowledging this and precedent for punishing companies who try to get away with scamming through silly fine-print clauses.
The point I was making was that just because something is included in a contract doesn't mean it's automatically the customer's fault if they are tricked in some way. I don't agree with the above commenter that such subscriptions or agreements should be illegal, but neither do I agree that in every instance it is the customer's fault when they wind up subscribed to a service they thought entailed a one-time payment.

As I understand it, if enough hash power joined p2pool it would eliminate the biggest reasons that miners avoid it (the higher variance). Once p2pool has enough of the network hash rate dedicated to it, it becomes more attractive for prospective miners to use, and it thus helps to maintain the decentralized nature of Bitcoin mining even if one or two contributory pools like Petamine stop using it.

First off, what graph do you think is "my graph"? You are so confused it's hard to even know where to begin when responding to you. You keep trying to put words in my mouth and attribute theories to me. It's one of the more epic strawman battles I've ever seen, and I am supremely entertained, but it certainly makes it hard to communicate when you can't keep straight what I have and have not posited. It's a constant surprise when you respond, and I am always delighted to see what your befuddled little arguments have devolved into with each successive comment.
This time around, you seem to have regressed back to about 4-5 comments back in the thread. You've selectively ignored Exhibit B for the *n*th time. You seem to be suppressing the memory of my primer on supply and demand (or perhaps you didn't understand it in the first place and were too afraid to ask for clarification). You have the gall to say:


...which is exceedingly hilarious. I "made up" a pattern? Pray tell, when? Remember to use actual quotes of mine (not piss-poor attempts at paraphrases) so we can keep your little mind on track. 
And don't even get me started on "without explanation"... See Exhibit B and the above comment regarding supply and demand.
It's clear you did not take the time to re-read the exchange from the beginning or I wouldn't have to keep giving you these refreshers.
At this point, I'm rapidly losing interest. You were vanquished quite some time ago and at this point you've basically gone full-troll. Pity. If you can't muster up something a little more respectable in your next reply, I may have to move on to worthier opponents and more meaningful debates/discussions, as fun as this has been.

Surprisingly enough, the world is not black and white. In a deflationary economy, businesses would still take risks and still expand. No, the credit to do so would not be so easily acquired, but believe it or not it would happen regardless. Those companies which successfully *do* take risks would eventually win against those who do not, by *beating the marginal rate of deflationary return on their investments*. I know you find this tricky to fathom, but you should be able to beat the market if you invest intelligently, and this doesn't change in a deflationary regime.


Why do you need more arbitrary units/tokens of a money supply to "satisfy your expanding money supply"?
Answer: you don't. You only would if the units/tokens you were using were not functionally divisible. Fortunately, in the context of Bitcoin, this is not the case, so you actually *don't* need an expanding money supply to mirror an expanding population or real output.

Well, for one, a lot of people speculated he was dead. This hurts that theory (though it's not PGP-signed so I suppose it's not 100% guaranteed verified Satoshi).

Oh, it was definitely an inside job.
They are paying people back the money they stole (having subsequently realized that their story had glaring holes in it) and are stealing in a more subtle and sustainable way now.
Conjecturing other explanations, like "maybe they lied in an innocent cover-up of an embarrassing screw-up" is really stretching it. All we know is their "official explanation" makes no sense, meaning it is a lie, that there are reports of admin-level privileges being abused and thefts occurring as a result, and they are giving back money that they claim was stolen, alleging that the kickbacks are generated off of fees. Meaning either these guys are idiots who fucked up monstrously and have yet to tell the truth about how and yet are the most generous and giving souls the world has ever seen....
**Or they are scammers, liars, and thieves and they are only giving back money that they themselves stole.** 
One of these explanations makes a lot of logical sense. One is highly unlikely.

You mean "the part of the transaction that still interfaces with the legacy financial system still suffers the same payment-processor woes"... i.e. Bitpay when you convert to fiat.

Right, basically.
Mining may be profitable without substantial block rewards, depending on the equilibrium fee structure that is ultimately achieved. 
Also, it may be just-profitable-enough to incentivize everyone who has already bought mining hardware (i.e. absorbed the sunk cost of the investment) to keep it running as a revenue stream. 
In other words, your assumption is a strong and valid one. But there are caveats to take into account.

Litecoin isn't even ASIC-resistant (its sole selling point), because apparently the Scrypt implementation was poorly chosen.
"Faster confirmation times" translates to "easier to double spend or 51% attack or temporarily accidentally fork" - did you think Satoshi chose the 10-minute interval to arbitrarily limit Bitcoins transaction speed or something? You may want to think this through a little longer.
One rich man could swoop in and absolutely rape the Litecoin markets. Perhaps that will never happen. **Perhaps.**
Half of that comment you linked to was decrying Bitcoin for early adopters' vast, unaccounted-for hoards that they might one day "dump" or at least leverage, to heavily manipulate the market. What about the thousands of rich men who could feasibly corner the Litecoin market and do the same thing if they were so inclined? Just as real of a threat.
I'm sorry, but Litecoin is in no way superior to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:41:06
If Bitcoin is still alive and kicking in 2030 and beyond, the spending will naturally increase because no one would expect adoption to skyrocket in the future any more, so no one would be waiting for the next (seemingly inevitable) "bubble" which magnifies their wealth.
Until Bitcoin is reasonably-adopted, do not worry about transaction volume. After adoption seems to be curtailing, the "currency" label will be more fitting. Until then it is still too lucrative to be evaluating strictly as a currency.

Firstly, wouldn't the sidechain itself be the "main chain" in this example, considering "all the BTC" moved there? In other words, nothing would need merging.
Secondly, where exactly is the problem in this scenario? He threatens to fire the maintainers, and perhaps even does... but is this the scariest doomsday prospect you can imagine coming of this? If so, it honestly doesn't sound that bad. I don't see any worrying malice or negative externalities proposed in your hypothetical.

What on earth do you mean by "we have to use it as a currency" then? 
I don't buy assets that I expect to appreciate in value just to get rid of them before they do so. 
We don't "have" to do anything. What we *should* do, as rational agents, is whatever we believe to be most beneficial to our individual lives, as the cases may be. 
Spending your Bitcoin for the sake of spending your Bitcoin will not affect whether or not Bitcoin succeeds. Either it is a superior payment network and will succeed organically, because it is in the best interest of individual agents to acquire or transfer it, or it will fail. Trying to "force" or even "encourage" people to circulate their Bitcoin is going to have a marginal effect **at very best**. It will most certainly not determine the trajectory of Bitcoin's future in any meaningful way.
I'm just tired of the "SPEND UR BTC" meme which makes no sense to attempt to forcefully propagate.

Sure, and while the technology is being adopted this will continue to hold true.

Absolutely right. It will be very fascinating to see how the block reward halving schedule affects the network, and whether things are sustainable long term.

It is almost impossible that they would be sold for that low. If they were, the buyer would be able to immediately arbitrage and take a riskless 30-40% profit.
Why let someone else take that 30% profit for free if you can afford to take it? Why not bid a little higher and take a riskless 20% arbitrage opportunity while it is there?

That sort of stuff just isn't my cup of tea, and in my opinion that's the vast majority of the content of that subreddit.
There are, of course, glimmers of insight to be found there, too. I lurk there pretty hard, if only to taste opinions outside the echo chamber of this sub and BM. And I'll admit, sometimes you guys are downright hilarious.
Personally I'm unconvinced of the link between mining and price floors. I know, I know, MC = MV and all that jazz... I just don't see mining as that important in terms of the intersection of supply and demand. Of those, the interesting function (to me) seems to be demand. Whether Bitcoin is going to manage to garner any more of that remains to be seen, but I definitely don't see it as a silly proposition.
In any case, I'm privileged in that my cost basis is probably still in the double-digits, so it would take a hefty catastrophe indeed to make me seriously worry. 
I'm still betting on institutional money coming (and relatively soon) anyway. I know, har har, look at the moonstruck idiot waiting for Wall Street.

The blockchain has properties that other means of value-transmission do not, making it more valuable for specific purposes (value-transmission) than other competing platforms.

"Demand for US currency" is just demand for purchasing power. You could argue there is largely equivalent demand for the purchasing power that Bitcoin provides, mitigated or obfuscated solely by the difficulty in the acquisition and usage thereof. 
If you really want to press the point and say that demand for Bitcoin is so small, you're inadvertently arguing in favor of its potential valuation being many orders of magnitude larger than the current value (circa $450).


So why did *you* bring it up?

Not true at all. It makes a huge difference. 
On a mortgage, you're not doing anything proactive with the Bitcoin that you borrowed. You're not trying to make any money with it.
Now pay attention closely here...
On a business opportunity, you're **trying to beat the risk-free rate of deflation, and generating returns in excess of what you would generate by merely holding onto your assets as they appreciate in value**. If you can do that, congratulations! You took out a good loan. If you can't beat the rate of deflation, you have no business taking out that loan.

No, he would start by taking a **10 BTC** loan from me, at the time thinking the only stipulation was to pay me back **11 BTC** in a year. Either the loan is denominated in $ and should be evaluated as such, or it is denominated in BTC and should be evaluated as such. You're trying to mix-and-match, which is very obviously idiotic. Take a moment and think it through, being very careful to keep your units straight. 
If my friend takes a loan in BTC, he should understand what risk that represents, considering the asset appreciates in value by thousands of percent per year regularly. Otherwise why wouldn't he denominate his loan in $? The expectations of his business venture need to be appropriate for the terms of the loan. If he operates in Bitcoin, collects revenue in Bitcoin, has a business plan that stands a good chance of staying relevant in the Bitcoin space and generating bitcoin-profit over time, and for some reason needs the money in the form of Bitcoin to get started, then maybe, just maybe, taking a loan in Bitcoin makes sense. Otherwise, it does not; at least not while Bitcoin stands a high chance of continuing to appreciate in value massively. DUCY?
Just make sure you keep your units straight in the future. Otherwise you might get all confused again. Let me know if you need things explained further.

To accept Bitcoin all you need to do is generate an address and provide it to the payer. No third-party is necessary.
To *convert* it to fiat, of course you'll need some sort of third-party willing to handle the conversion.
It is absolutely ludicrous that you're requesting bitcoins be converted into dollars via open-source code without involving a payment processor. 
This post is a joke. No offense intended, but your complaints don't really have to do with Bitcoin, they have to do with fiat.

Clearly that would count, but unless is an alt-account of yours, my question was not directed at you. If someone was spouting off on about how easy it is to perform a particular high-level calculation, and I asked them if they have actually ever done such a thing, do you think it would be relevant for a famous world-class mathematician to stop by and say "I've done so!" in the discussion? That would be silly. Clearly I was not asking *you* whether you have any firsthand experience with double-spends, as the answer to that should be obvious from the linked post.
Also, not that I am suspicious of your claims, but to be frank, I have observed a tendency of core developers to exaggerate the negatives of the problems that they are focused on solving. Don't get me wrong, I respect the work you do, but I've seen too many "the sky is falling"esque posts from core devs who have vested interests in the public perception of a problem to take them at face-value. Anyone remember how Mike Hearn went on and on about how bottlenecked core development is *right before launching Lighthouse*? I just enjoy a healthy grain of salt when it comes to such things. If you're working on mitigating double-spends and one of your primary means of employment is as a consultant to firms who are worried about them, your best bet at job security is to scream from the mountaintops how ghastly of a problem it is.

You're still trying to cram a square peg into a round hole. The reason I am speaking of incentives is because *they are what make a blockchain work*. An insight you have yet to acquire, it seems.
Now, I will repeat, since you are still not acknowledging this: **there is no advantage to using a blockchain in the scenario you describe. None whatsoever. Not a single tiny benefit.** The bank can and should use a different form of database in your hypothetical, because a blockchain exposes them to all sorts of risks and technical logistical headaches and problems and, once again, **confers no benefits if they are a centralized authority reigning over the transmissions contained on it**. If the users are allowed to mine with this hypothetical app, then that contradicts your earlier premise that only the bank can mine this chain. If they can mine then they can theoretically 51% the chain; why would a bank introduce this risk when they get no benefits from using a blockchain? If they can't mine, there's no "outsourcing of expenses" for the bank so there goes your one (absurd) postulated advantage that the bank could gain out of this.
You have yet to acknowledge that the **only** reason to implement a  blockchain system in favor of an alternative is if you want to have unique untrusting parties agree on a general ledger and you don't want to have a central arbiter of that ledger. If you want a central arbiter, **don't bother with a blockchain** because it will slow things down, add extra risks and points of failure, complicate matters greatly, and ultimately serve no purpose whatsoever.
You seem to be glazing over that crucial point of what a blockchain does. It does not use participants' processing power for some awesome function **other than distributed consensus with the lack of a central authority**. You don't need a blockchain to alter database tables efficiently. A blockchain will actually hurt that function in a number of ways.
Are you purposefully trolling, or do you seriously not understand this after all we've been through in this thread?

What? You can acquire bitcoins in a variety of ways. You don't have to use Coinbase; they're just uber-convenient. Use LocalBitcoins. Wire money to an exchange. Mine them yourself. You can get them however you want.
The "5% fees" are a result of the legacy money-transfer systems as they come in contact with Bitcoin. Coinbase has to wait for ACH transfers to clear and risk being defrauded; they charge you a fee to cover this. 
The point is, once you're *in* Bitcoin, the fees drop down to pretty-darn-close-to-0%.
And as for Bitpay, I think you may have made a typo and hit "5" when you meant ["0-1% fees"]( better luck in your future attempts at slander!

No, relative to other large pools, P2Pool miners are not subsidized enough because they have a lower hash-rate and thus a higher variance in block rewards (or rather, the timing thereof). This disincentivizes miners from moving to p2pool, and allows conglomerates like GHash to amass a significant chunk of the Bitcoin network hash rate, leading to increased vulnerability to a 51% attack (and thus makes Bitcoin as a whole less attractive).
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:03:00
I'm still unconvinced about the p2p post, too. 
The greatest likelihood is that the account/database was compromised and the posting was not from the real Satoshi. 
The second likeliest scenario is that he thought it would be "cool" to resurface for a moment just to say 5 words, and then peace out into the abyss again. Adding a PGP signature would detract from the brevity of the message. Also, neglecting to sign it could help in terms of obfuscating his identity; if we're not even sure if it was Satoshi who posted it, why bother digging too deeply into the logs to see the details of the access?
Not a strong argument, but the best I've come up with (in favor of it being a legitimate message from the founder).

If anything, there's *more* of a reason to assume it will jump in price. It has gotten serious attention from serious financial firms at this point. The press no longer treats it as a joke. Mainstream celebrities are making references to it. The United States has explicitly declared the technology will remain legal, and other countries around the world are following suit. The whole association with darknet-markets has dwindled and it's no longer seen as "imaginary Internet drug money" quite so much.

Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses? They cost more, they're slower, they're more dangerous, the gas they run on is harder to procure than hay, and they're confusing!" Of course they are, at first. Technology needs time to mature.

Some stores do offer discounts to use cash over card. Many others prohibit you from purchasing smaller than $5 with a card.
As for the McDonald's in 5 years, it's still not really a use-case we're championing Bitcoin for, since it's an in-person transaction, and Bitcoin is built for remote payments. So you're still picking a pretty bad context to evaluate Bitcoin's advantages in...
But there are still conceivable advantages to doing so. For one, it could be just as easy (or easier) than a credit card at that point. Theoretically it could be a one-click approval button on your phone, meaning you don't even need to swipe a card (which can be annoying and over time as the card's strip wears down, sometimes starts taking more than one try to successfully swipe). Also it would allow you to keep a healthy portion of your savings in a deflationary currency, essentially meaning your purchasing power is constantly growing in between expenditures.
From the *merchant's* perspective there are plenty of other reasons why Bitcoin is advantageous.

@_date: 2014-04-15 19:04:17
First off, I'm not so no, I didn't say that. 
Aside from that...


It's both. The bubbles always pop, and they always stabilize at values higher than the value when the [Hype Cycle]( began. It's obvious that Bitcoin is appreciating in value, what's *not* obvious is how far it will go (both up and down) on each iteration of the cycle. Which is why said:


So yes, it's obvious that the bubble will eventually pop, and Bitcoin will have to stabilize again before the next spurt in growth. Theoretically, that last bubble could have grown and grown until we were at values of $10,000 per Bitcoin, and then it could have crashed *all the way* down to $1500, and that $1200 Bitcoin you bought in December would have still been cheap. Obviously this isn't what happened, but the point is you don't know how things would have gone had things been different; imagine China announced something *positive* about Bitcoin instead.




Everyone who invested in Bitcoin prior to or during a surge is indeed making money during a rally.
The bitcoins themselves are being mined. The "money" (by which I assume you mean fiat) is being exchanged.


Not necessarily, no. This is a fallacy, I'm happy to say. The next paragraph is necessarily going to be a bit abstract, but hopefully you'll be able to get something out of it regardless.
Dollars and bitcoins are units of account meant to represent value. Value is an extremely complicated concept, but suffice it to say you are not doing it justice to assume that the supply of "value" remains static over time. The process of natural selection (when applied to human enterprise rather than biological heredity) culminates in an accelerating accretion of total value available in the system. Bitcoin is simultaneously in the process of capturing more access to this value over time than other asset classes, and the basic premise which allows this to occur is that it currently exists as the most efficient mechanism through which this value can be represented or transported.
If I buy a yo-yo from you for $1 by handing you a dollar bill, and you run down to the corner-store and buy a chocolate bar with that same dollar bill, then between you, me, and the shopkeeper we just used 1 piece of paper and managed to convert a yo-yo into a chocolate bar, a chocolate bar into a dollar bill, and a dollar bill into a yo-yo. No one "lost a dollar" by handling their end of the conversion, the value was just transformed during the transaction.
Bitcoin is bigger than that. It's capturing value from fiat, because it is a working deflationary currency dropped into a bucket of inflationary ones, and basic human greed is going to flock to that.
Much in the same way as there can be [gains from trade]( there can be gains from efficiency of trade that are realized by those agents intelligent enough to leverage that efficiency responsibly. The value being transformed throughout the trade process is at its roots the result of human effort, and the means by which it evolves and appreciates during that process are convoluted and manifold, but long story short is that in the end there can be more value than there was at the beginning and no one necessarily has to have lost value for that to happen.
Money is not a zero-sum game, I'm afraid. That's a big assumption and you have to recognize it and question it as such.


The only way to ruin yourself "playing bitcoin" is to invest more than you can afford to lose. Don't do that. Period.

Heh, I am very vocal when I think I have things figured out. I haven't been so good at foreseeing altcoin run-ups, so I don't have any hot tips in that department.
The one prediction I *do* have to share is something no one wants to hear right now: this incredible exponential price growth we've been seeing in Bitcoin *will* end, and the market will correct downwards *violently*. And I don't mean a 20-30% drop, I mean a 60-90% drop, where true despair sets in and everyone who hasn't been through a Bitcoin bear market before (and even some who have) feel the *other* side of holding Bitcoin. Many will sell every satoshi they own, and say "I knew it was a scam all along" and kick themselves for ever getting involved.
It's ugly, it hurts, it puts you in a bad mood that you can't seem to escape, and it's coming. I don't know if the drop will come after a top at $12k, or at $20k, or even at $30k, but I am confident beyond confident that it will come sometime in the next few months. It won't be the end of Bitcoin's amazing growth (though it might feel like it), so those who truly take the long-term outlook will benefit from it... and I wish I could give anything specific enough to base your trades on, but I really can't and I would be lying if I pretended I could.

Yeah, the "long-term" prospect of Bitcoin gets very hazy at a certain point. I, too, have tried to imagine how it could possibly play out, to no real avail.
Even Satoshi said:


(emphasis my own)
When the creator himself (who, regardless of the cult following he has achieved, *was* admirably prescient) admitted that this system was designed with "several years" as a relevant timeframe, it is enough to give one pause.
I *think* the general premise is "focus on making sure the bootstrapping process is as efficient as possible" which should hypothetically result in serious adoption (if only out of greed), and then let the rest sort itself out. Which, admittedly, isn't a comforting image of the future of this little experiment.
It's still open source and potentially adaptive, though, so I suppose speculators/gamblers/investors/adopters/whatever-you-want-to-call-em could always find solace in the possibility of the community-at-large solving the problems as they arise.

The thing about lost coins is that they don't really hurt the Bitcoin protocol or network in any way. Since the units (bitcoins) are so divisible, we can keep working with smaller and smaller units to make transactions if the need arises. 
To answer the initial question: it's definitely *possible* that Bitcoin becomes a world currency (by certain definitions, it already is). Acceptance by major online retailers (which has just begun) is looking more and more like a certainty in the long-run, and it's a short hop from that to a "closed economy" that functions seamlessly on Bitcoin. 
At this point, in my opinion, the "cryptocurrency genie has been let out of the bottle" - the blockchain is an amazing innovation that is here to stay. Whether we're using Bitcoin or some superior derivative in a decade's time is another question entirely, and one that I am simply unable to answer one way or the other right now in early 2014... but I think that yes, you will be seeing a lot more usage of cryptocurrency in the coming years.

What precisely would turn you off of Bitcoin? 51% of the hashing power has been controlled by one "entity" at multiple points in the history of the network. You're making an enormous leap from "monopoly manifest" to "systemic meltdown and subsequent deterrence of participants" that does not withstand logical nor historical scrutiny. I'd like to see that section fleshed out a little more, before I pass a judgment on how serious of an issue this is.
Personally, I have a hard time imagining a scenario where some sort of mining monopoly actually hurts Bitcoin long-term.

You do not need to artificially encourage investment and lending. The free market does that naturally. 
People invest because they want more money than they have right now, and are willing to postpone current expenditures to achieve that goal. People lend for the same reason.

I duly note you skipped/ignored the majority of what I wrote, but that's ok.
SatoshiDice being a bad investment is hardly meaningfully relevant to the basic point, though. 
I wouldn't have paid 100,000 BTC for it unless I thought that it would net me more than that through operations. If it did not do so, then to the purchaser I say: "Sucks to suck!"
If you ask to borrow 10 BTC and promise to pay me back 11 after a year, and I have assessed that you are trustworthy and capable of doing so, I will lend you the BTC. Otherwise I will not.
Once you've borrowed Bitcoin (taken out a loan denominated in it) it is your responsibility to see the terms of the loan fulfilled. If Bitcoin skyrockets in value, then that loan is going to hurt you more than an alternative dollar-denominated one would have. So again, it is your responsibility to determine whether such a loan is rational to take out.
If you expect to run a business which operates in BTC and generates returns in BTC and are confident that you will have more than 10% profits for that period, taking such a loan may indeed be a  rational course of action.
The unit by which things are denominated should not matter more than the actual prospects of the investment opportunity itself. This is the key insight that inflation-fanboys entirely miss. 
So, again, SatoshiDice's performance is what matters, not the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value since its acquisition. If it has not and likely will not generate &gt;100,000BTC in one way or another for the owner, then paying such a price for it was a poor investment decision. Just like buying pets.com stock was a poor decision, but that doesn't mean Internet investments will never work.

I think you may misunderstand what a private key is. 
From the very very beginning of Bitcoin, having a private key (a string of characters) gives you full possession and control of a corresponding public key and address. The address is generated from the public key, and the public key is generated from the private key. So, in short, if you have the private key you have everything.

So, magic? That's your explanation?
I'm not overcomplicating it. It doesn't sound like it could work. Human greed gets in the way. Bitcoin is doomed, and I am convinced of this because you failed to answer the question of how we manage to reach a consensus. The whole system doesn't work; virtual/digital money can't be produced in a distributed way like this, because there's no way for everyone to agree, even though it would be in the best interest of the community for everyone to do so. Humans are greedy agents, don't you see?
 &gt;I've already explained it to you, and you know it. I know you're not this stupid. Just a troll.
I'm clearly "not this stupid" - I'm demonstrating that the answers above are not sufficient for a reasonably-inquisitive mind who is interested in Bitcoin. I am not asking for an explanation that would suffice for a 5-year-old, this is not I'm asking you to explain the protocol of Bitcoin in a way to sufficiently convince a rational person that the system works, and you've claimed that you can do so without mentioning proof-of-work or cryptography.
You cannot. I have proven my point.

She included the words "This is the guy who created Bitcoin" in her article. Show me a single quote or disclaimer where she said anything at all about the possibility of it *not* being the creator of Bitcoin.
Was there a sentence spared saying "Mind you, we haven't proven anything"? They spun it as fact. 
I even addressed this in my above comment: 


They spun it as fact, and the last quote proves this: "the facts are much stranger than the well-established fiction" - what could this be referring to, if not the "fact" that Dorian Nakamoto is the creator of Bitcoin? What other "facts" did the Newsweek piece bring to light?

Every time someone posts something like this, or says the trite "past performance is no guarantee of future results" adage, I am reminded of [the arguments presented in this video]( 
Until you can successfully rebut the sigma growth curve or posit a rational reason that the price of a Bitcoin should plateau before the adoption thereof has peaked, you might want to keep your mouth shut.

What do consumer expenditure habits in a nascent network have to do with the price or value of a Bitcoin? 
The price is determined by 2 things: supply and demand. Supply is easy. Demand is trickier, and the variance thereof determines price. Why should there be benefits to spending Bitcoin, from a consumer perspective? As long as demand is outpacing supply (which it is and has always been doing by a wide margin) I have no reason to really demand any additional benefits from the transmission of my coins. They're appreciating as I hold them.
If Bitcoin keeps doing that, everyone will want it. When everyone wants it, they compete for it. The kickbacks to the consumer are an endgame; first the system needs to be bootstrapped and competition within any given sector is sparse. As long as the ecosystem continues to evolve (spoiler: it does) then over time the companies that offer the most reliable, safe, and rewarding services will rise to the top. Until there is a hefty amount of competition, expecting savings to be passed on to the consumer is demanding a bit too much a bit prematurely.
Anyway, the main point is that, regarding the value or price, it doesn't really matter if people want to spend in Bitcoin as long as they want it at all.

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:45:47
Sure. We are in for at least one more Hype Cycle iteration, and more likely two. One will almost certainly take place later this year.
The unit price of Bitcoin will reach an order of magnitude higher than it is now (in other words, it will rise to a value in excess of $6000). It is quite possible it will rise one more from there, but I am unable to assert such with confidence at this stage.
The utility of Bitcoin is simply too high for the figures to work out to be lower than that, I'm afraid. I can understand a healthy dose of skepticism that it will continue bubbling like it has historically done (and that's the right attitude to take at first) but there is simply no way the unit price per coin is less than $1000 after the massive infrastructurial advances and widespread acceptance that Bitcoin has been garnering since the last bubble have had time to run their course. So, the advice I give is to buy a little bit of Bitcoin (if you haven't already) - not more than you're willing to lose, but enough so that the "reasonably-inevitable" 10x multiplier means something to your life.

The masses involved in the monetary system are the only relevant ones. The beliefs of those outside looking in have no effect. And again, you are implicitly arguing that mining must remain massively distributed for Bitcoin to retain such characteristics, which is not actually strictly necessarily true, however adamantly you may hold that belief. 
You disagree with Satoshi, me, and Andreas on the matter. One successful malicious double-spend and the organism known as Bitcoin will blacklist the perpetrator(s) and continue onward; of that I have no doubt. 
There will be doomsdayers in any field, I suppose. You can stand on your pulpit and cry that the skies are falling, but the beliefs you hold are pessimistic to the point of naivety.

The word *genius* is clearly not objective.
Einstein merits the term. Satoshi Nakamoto merits the term. Kurt Gödel merits the term. I would say Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page all merit the term.
Do I speak with divine authority? Certainly not. But in my opinion you're being too conservative with the word "genius" - if it is to be a useful term at all, *someone* has to deserve it.

Good, now you've finally answered the question I asked. Only took a couple more comments than it should have.
In order to spend it, any of it, they're going to have to break it down into tiny fractions and launder/mix it and cash out through something like LocalBitcoins. 
Definitely possible to do, at least a couple times, with little risk of getting caught if you are ultra-careful at every step of the process. To ever cash out a significant portion, your risk starts to compound dangerously quickly. Want to get some money for groceries? No problem. Jump through hoops w, x, y, and z. Want to buy a car or a house? Good luck staying off the radar.

This is an unfortunately naive and shortsighted outlook you have adopted.


It means that those of us in the 99.9% are all a little worse off. The effect it has on your life is a financially negative one. If the situation were not as it is, hypothetically you would have a larger house, a nicer car, a bigger TV, less outstanding debts, and a fatter retirement fund so you could stop working at a younger age. 


Fortunately you were just told, so now you know. Knowledge is better than ignorance.


Read some of the comments here before saying things like this. Of course wealth inequality will still exist in Bitcoin. Other exacerbators of the problem (e.g. regulatory capture and abusive, opaque monetary issuance) would be largely mitigated by Bitcoin.

I understand completely, because Dune is one of the hardest books to get into. He thrusts you into the universe pretty mercilessly. I'd recommend trying to bear with it for a couple hundred pages, though, if you ever have the urge to revisit it. There's a reason it's considered a classic of the genre.
I haven't read anything of his outside the Duniverse, to be honest, though, so I don't have much else to gauge Herbert from. I'll probably give White Plague a try, just from this conversation. Fortunately it won't be able to taint Dune for me.

Then the government's decrees necessarily cannot be entirely representative of the Will of Society unless the system of governance is 100% unanimously supported and the enacted legislation perfectly represents the aggregate desires of each member of society in full.
Are you saying government is perfect? Do you believe that as soon as society's beliefs change, the legislation instantly updates to reflect this? 
The process is far more convoluted and messy than that. Even if you ignore the fact that no system of government ever has been able to reflect society's will perfectly (or else it would obviously be the only extant system of government), it takes a while for beliefs and will to be bureaucratically digested and to translate into law and policy. 
Government is not perfect. Society is an abstract concept and it is bigger and broader than the governing arm it entails.

Your potato business is not as profitable as simply buying bitcoins. You have no business growing potatoes (or rather, you can grow potatoes if you want, but you're underperforming - it would be far more profitable for you to simply buy and hold Bitcoin).
Your example basically boils down to: "If I can't keep up with Bitcoin's growth, why would I borrow Bitcoin?" 
In that case, if you're not competitive enough to outperform the annual rate of deflation, then **don't take out the loan**. It's that simple.
Your example is comical. You're assuming Bitcoin continues growing in value to try and demonstrate why it shouldn't grow in value. And you're trying to furnish hypotheticals involving business opportunities that underperform relative to the market, to "prove a point" that those opportunities should not be financed in Bitcoin. Hilarity.

This is ridiculous. I give up; you're right. This old Japanese man is definitely the until-now-immaculately-anonymous creator of Bitcoin. He also decided to use his real name when publishing, yet lie about his age by about 30 years. Oh, and he always used a VPN located in Japan whenever accessing his online accounts. For some reason. Even though he used his real name. From his birth certificate.
Oh, and the evidence we have that it's him? A cherrypicked quote that could refer to anything. The evidence we have that it's *not* him? He denies it. Satoshi denies it. Nothing about him seems similar to Satoshi in any way other than the name and a nerdy background.

Nor do I even necessarily believe this is a "problem" which demands a "solution" - though I do think thieves should be punished by the law to the best of the government's ability, the free market should, over time, iron out these wrinkles itself.

The same cannot be said of LTC. Literally the only serious argument in favor of Litecoin is "Maybe a bunch of people will try to capitalize on it when they think Bitcoin's boat has sailed; if you time it right, you might be able to take these people's money!"

That document says "Who to attack", not "how the theft occurred". Transaction Malleability doesn't just transport Bitcoins to a mythical hacker. Link me to the explanation on **how** they lost coins to Transaction Malleability. Linking to bitcoin movements on the blockchain does nothing, because anyone (in this case they) can send bitcoin to an "attacker" all night long. That's not what we want explained. What we want explained is **how** they claim they lost the coins - which they claimed was due to Transaction Malleability. 
They "lost" thousands of bitcoins due to TM, yet the total amount of theft that exploitation of TM can account for is 386 BTC? Their story was bunk. Posting documents of people to doxx doesn't explain their theft, because I'll explain exactly what happened:
**The admins of the SR2.0 saw all the fuss about Transaction Malleability when Gox pulled that shit in February, and fundamentally misunderstanding what that bug could and could not do, they decided "This is it, this is how we'll steal everyone's coins and get away with it!" and wrote up that ridiculous sop story about how heartbroken they were.**
**Then someone probably realized "Wait, TM isn't exactly just a thing that just makes bitcoins stealable like that..." and they decided on a different con, which involved maintaining their userbase by reimbursing the bitcoins, while robbing them in other ways.**
That is what Occam's Razor leads us to. Their story has never and will never make sense, because **they fucking stole the coins**. You're either in on it or stupid and I'm hoping it's the former.

They *are* enough now; Bitcoin is growing before your eyes.
Bitcoin is a better system which offers less financial friction. Those who care about efficiency in money transmission will use it because it's superior. Those who don't (the everyday Joes) will use the systems that are maintained by those who do.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:10:00
Well-responded. And the current difficulties of securing your stake of the nascent technology are indeed a huge hurdle to be overcome. The theory (which I believe, and apparently you do not) is that the geek community that has already been "hyped" into adopting Bitcoin now has a vested financial interest in ensuring that such user-unfriendliness is overcome.
I don't believe we need much more hype. The goal is not to convince every single end-user that Bitcoin is the proper protocol of transmission to use. The goal is to demonstrate to the financial juggernauts that it is sufficiently efficient and workable. Once *they* adopt (or even a subset of them do), the Average Joes don't really matter. Behind-the-scenes success is tantamount to total success.
So, provided the protocol *is* more efficient than the other remote payment methods, again we reach a conclusion of crypto's inevitable "success" in a profound way. 
Of course, the contingency that an altcoin can usurp Bitcoin is always possible. But see above - network effect + open-source dynamic protocol + economic incentive structure... it's conceivable but not likely.

The "CIA meeting scared Satoshi away" is such a silly theory. It makes absolutely no sense.
In no way would Gavin talking to the CIA "scare" Satoshi. He probably left because he felt Bitcoin was strong enough to continue without him, and it had been his plan all along to fade into the background when that became true.
If the CIA thing had scared him at all or he disapproved of it in any fashion, he wouldn't have handed off the alert keys and head dev role to Gavin.
Sometimes people just parrot hypotheses that make no sense, without any amount of thought put into the matter. Now is one of those times. I encourage you to think things through and come to a more sensible conclusion. Yes, Satoshi left. No, it had nothing to do with Gavin sitting down and presenting to the CIA.

Much better response. Thank you for the expansion/elaboration on your point. I see what you're saying now.
There are 2 types of deflation: price and monetary-base. I am now sure you understand this, so I'll try to be explicit when using the word deflation from here on just to keep things clear.
First: when you say Bitcoin "is inherently deflationary when the monetary supply can't expand" I'm once again going to reiterate that this is untrue for another century, as the block rewards will continue to produce new bitcoins during that time.
Despite the prices of goods being based on and pegged to USD, when assessing the cost of these as denominated in Bitcoin, it is falling as the exchange rate of Bitcoin increases. Just as in General Relativity you can say that the rest of the universe is in motion while you are at rest (in other words, you define your own frame of reference) I can easily see things as falling in price if I hold my wealth in Bitcoin, meaning that in some sense, I am experiencing price deflation. In my Bitcoin Lorentz-frame, I am at rest while things around me fluctuate in price.
I won't deny that this is a bit silly of an outlook, practically speaking, but it is nonetheless a valid perspective.
Thus, in both monetary-base and price senses, the following is somewhat invalidated:
 


I do not disagree when you say that Bitcoin "currently functions almost exclusively as a distributed payment processor for USD" but I do disagree with your conclusion that Bitcoin therefore does not qualify as a currency and terms like "inflation" don't apply to it. If you could summon a definition of the word "currency" that strengthens your stance here, I'll concede this point, but I doubt that will be possible or even necessary.

@_date: 2014-07-11 18:49:10
A very interesting thought experiment. 
How did I acquire those coins? Through mining? In other words, what was my cost basis? 
What sort of revenues did SatoshiDice realize before and after my acquisition? Have I re-couped my investment / reached ROI?
Did I hold onto another large chunk of Bitcoin despite that expenditure? If not, why not? Did I not believe in Bitcoin and the potential long-term returns it offers?
The answers to all of these questions have a profound influence on how I would feel about making that SD investment.
Also, if I paid $1M worth of Bitcoin back then, but I've made more than that in profit since then (even if it is not $60M) then I still did well, right?
Clearly I would have been better off HODLing in this scenario, but you can't beat yourself up too hard for that sort of thing, just like people shouldn't beat themselves up for not buying $1000 of Bitcoin when they were $0.01 each. 
I think in this scenario, I would ask Oprah, "How much Bitcoin do *you* own? If you had bought $100 worth when it was trading for fractions of pennies, that would be worth millions of dollars now. In retrospect, how do *you* feel about your decision to abstain from doing so?" I'd also probably make fun of her weight.

None of those functions are impeded by deflation. You're parroting an opinion as if it's a fact.

Specialization provides benefits to the individuals who have specialized, and always will. Basic incentives. People will do what is in their best interest.
Satoshi *did* understand that ASICs and mining farms were inevitable if the system really took off. I'm sure he spent a great deal of time trying to think of a way to prevent that, but really, there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. Because we, as a society, have realized the benefits of specialization, you can't try to make us "un-learn" the lesson in a particular domain.

The codebase itself could be contributed to by him, sure, but it's unlikely he would do such a thing right now without good reason. To be honest, [it could be changed by you or me]( if we were so inclined. It's open-source. 
Getting the changes adopted by miners would be the tricky part, if they weren't minor tweaks.
But to be honest, a more likely scenario to worry about would be Satoshi selling/liquidating a portion of his alleged stash of 1 million coins, which he could theoretically do at any time while still alive. When available supply on the market goes up, but demand remains constant, the price falls... but again, there is really no reason to assume Satoshi would do this right now.

That run-up could have *easily* and in my opinion *should* have easily kept going well past $1200. Blaming for not predicting the Black Swan event of The People's Bank of China "banning" Bitcoin is a bit harsh.

It's basic human behavior.


Perhaps because the subreddit had just quadrupled in size after massive influxes of new users? Yeah, that irrationality you speak of, it just so happens to be a symptom of *every single large group ever*, or in other words it comes with the territory of being popular. This is the same reasons the default subreddits are so much less thoughtful or rational than the niche ones. It's basic stuff.


For someone who is "not part of it" you seem to get a weird kick out of subscribing to the forum where proponents of the idea come to discuss it. I guess you just like poking poop with sticks a lot. Different strokes for different folks.


Well of course that's the first question you ask. It's a question only you can answer, and the only responsible way to do so is to carefully take into account all the factors you can, including the history of the asset itself and the most-logical explanation you can generate in terms of *why* that asset's value behaved in that way. 
If you come to the conclusion that you *do* believe the asset will continue to appreciate in value, *then* you begin to ask further questions, like what the commenter you're replying to has suggested.


Which is why everyone always suggests "DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE" over and over regarding Bitcoin. We give that advice for a reason. If you ever see someone in this community suggesting otherwise, *then* it makes sense to judge them and decry them for it.

I have already given you your explanation: Bitcoin is a technology, or an innovation, if you will.
[Technologies and innovations tend to follow the S curve in terms of adoption or diffusion.](
If you want a quick primer, check out [Wikipedia]( If you're still not satisfied, read [this paper](
If you're going to ask "*Why* do innovations spread in this way? The burden of proof is still on you!" despite these sources, then I must point you in the direction of a certain [Richard Feynman video]( in which he explains how silly the question "why" is, when fanatically pursued. Eventually we're going to wind up on electrons and quarks, and you'll still be able to say "But *why*?" and congratulate yourself on how smart you are, despite the fact that I satisfactorily answered all the truly relevant inquiries long ago. 
So before you ask "why" again, read the documents I've provided, watch the video I linked to, and consider things carefully. If you *still* want to try and troll, I can't promise I'll continue engaging you and you may have to get your kicks elsewhere.

Hence my specifically-chosen examples of good thermal conductors.
[There are other things that conduct heat better than silver, too.]( So you really have no strong basis of support here; silver is not as economical/practical for conducting heat as copper, and it's not even the *best* thermal conductor out there. You're backing yourself into a corner.


Absolutely not. The Bitcoin blockchain is definitely superior to the LTC blockchain, for a myriad of reasons. It is more respected, it has a larger network built around it, the units thereof are already being accepted by many real-world merchants, it is more secure due to the quantity of hashpower it has attracted, the "market cap" of Bitcoin is large enough to be able to resist "bully" whales, it is already exchanged on a number of platforms for other currencies, etc etc etc. 




Well explain to me how silver has intrinsic value. You said "The intrinsic value of silver is the value it possesses in its own right, as an end-in-itself." Silver can't do *anything* valuable by itself. It's not self-organizing into computer chips and forming intelligent robots. It conducts heat relatively well? So what? Why is that intrinsically valuable? Simple: it's not. 
When this was explained to you, your answer was: "silver has properties that other elements do not, making it more valuable for specific purposes than other elements... this is intrinsic value."
My "jump" is a mere observation that if you are indeed going to claim that silver's "intrinsic value" is due to the properties it has that other elements do not, then I can equally well claim that Bitcoin  has "intrinsic value" due to the the properties it has that other financial platforms do not. It's a pretty clear application of logic, especially structured as it was; I'm surprised you find it difficult to follow. 
You have yet to actually point out a reason silver is intrinsically valuable in a way that would preclude Bitcoin from being the same. Until you do, the logic stands, unchallenged, like a majestic lion with its mane caught in the African wind.

$1M / $630 per coin ≈ 1600 BTC. If you think you can sell 1600 BTC in one sell-order on an exchange without having a negative impact on the price, much less do it 55x in a row, *much much less* do it in a cryptocurrency with a market-cap of $55M total, you are, in short, retarded.

You and I responded around the same time with roughly the same response (not sure who got there first as I'm on mobile) but I wanted to float something by you regarding a potential scheme that preserves (some of) the benefits of pseudonymity...
You could create a master database limited to one KYC-verified "seed key" per user. This seed key is mapped to a fingerprint (and this fingerprint is a mandatory 2FA factor for any participation or usage of the platform). 
The seed key is then used for the generation of a hierarchical deterministic tree, just like in BIP32. Any node on this tree represents a "pseudonymous identity token" that can be authenticated with the corresponding private key in the tree, and (perhaps optionally) accumulate "karma" (or whatever sort of platform-specific user data you want to track) on behalf of the aggregate identity tree. You would also be able to provide people "identity branches" of your tree, so that they can verify specific subsets of your participation without being able to determine the full scope of your identity or know anything about any branches you did not explicitly authenticate for them.
Rolling the idea around in my brain, I don't see any obvious flaws with it. You could, for any subreddit or subplatform, always limit participants by requiring unique fingerprints for registration. Granted, this isn't particularly feasible *today*, nor probably for a good while yet. But the idea itself (hierarchally-deterministic identity trees + strict registration controls + necessarily-unique 2FA + reputational scoring system) seems like it would pretty wholly solve the problem being discussed here.

You fundamentally misunderstand the appeal of Bitcoin. WallStCoin is either a true distributed cryptocurrency or it's not. If it is, Wall Street has no more control over it than you or I. If it's not, then it's irrelevant to the discussion and not really a competitor to Bitcoin; it'd just be "Wall St funbux" and the only conceivable driver of demand would be profit offered from the pockets of Wall St themselves.
I've said it time and time again, and each new generation of trolls seems to require the same education: you can't just launch a centralized alternative to Bitcoin and expect it to work. It misses the entire point. Stripping the "fair" or "distributed" qualifiers from the idea fundamentally castrates it.

That was actually a commendable response and defense of the word choice. 
I'll grant it. I retract my earlier condemnation of your claim.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:05:20


Firstly, you are 100% incapable of providing a quote or citation that supports this claim. Satoshi didn't explain his reasoning behind putting the limit in place, though he *did* vehemently defend it staying in place after he put it there, against a great deal of backlash.
Secondly, even assuming you're completely correct when you attempt to magically divine Satoshi's specific intent with the limit (despite having no actual quotes to back up your claim), what makes you think that Bitcoin isn't still in its "infancy", and still very much in need of such a limit? It's still beta software (some would even argue alpha!) and is nowhere near a 1.0 release. We have not even transitioned to primarily-fee-based mining incentives yet, for crying out loud.


Yes, I know you can't. That's the point. Everyone who argues like you do doesn't have *nearly* enough of a clue to be able to do so.

No, the only way a blockchain (or any black box technical solution) could prevent a Sybil attack is either by introducing a cost of participation. That approach doesn't work against well-financed attackers; the whole problem we are trying to solve is the fact that these companies can use money to exert undue social influence. Involving a blockchain would just make this worse.
The problem can only truly be solved with perfect identity authentication mechanisms, which are necessarily external to a blockchain. 
If a platform limits every user to one KYC-verified account and requires fingerprint authentication for any usage session, that solves the problem. You could even maintain pseudonymity, in theory, by involving hierarchically deterministic identity trees. 
That's actually a very intriguing thought avenue to entertain.

Why should that be? Once Bitcoin has been "adopted" the rate of deflation is not likely to be so severe, at all.


What about it? People spend. There is a time preference of money. You do not need to try and make them spend any more than they already do.
In fact, people spend *more* during times of deflation, especially in Bitcoin. This is validated by empirical evidence, which is a huge ace-in-the-hole. 


*You're* missing the point, my friend. The reasons you outlined above are bunk.

But Core *does* have blocksize increasing code already written, tested, and released. As I mention later, any hard forks to increase it further *are reliant on the data we get from the first increase with SegWit*.
This is referred to as "data driven development" and is, in general, a wise policy when it comes to complex systems.
We should never hard fork for the sake of hard forking. What you want us to do is *increase capacity*, not necessarily increase capacity *with a hard fork*. That is an irrational stipulation.
Now, once we have some data informing our perspective on the subject, and are able to gauge the effects of a blocksize increase on the network and ecosystem, we should be able to intelligently plan what hard fork(s) might be necessary to get *more* capacity in safe ways.

For the "must"s in that sentence to work, you need to be able to provide a definitional justification. In other words, you need to be able to prove, **a priori**, that "a service with a broad clientele" must meet the criteria you have outlined to exist. If you are unable to do so, the claim is incorrect.
This is simple logic. If I made the claim, "To be dog, you must have wings" then you would rightly be able to say "That claim is incorrect" and your proof would be, simply: **Nothing about the definition of a dog requires it to possess wings.**
Similarly, nothing about the definition of a service for a broad clientele requires the criteria you have listed.

First you said the miners upheld their end of the Hong Kong agreement. **This is false.** When I pointed this out, you said that Core broke their side of the agreement. **Also false.** When I pointed this out, you said that Luke-Jr never made a hard-fork proposal that dealt with blocksizes, and had only ever proposed hard-forks for features not related to blocksize that "no one wanted". **This is also false.** When I pointed this out, you have said that the safety reduction in Luke-Jr's BIP (the very existence of which you denied in your previous comments) is "required" and not optional... which, once again, is **False!**

Create a transaction and publish it to the blockchain.
Lightning Network transactions **are** Bitcoin transactions. This is important to remember. If the receiver is not on LN, that just means you will make a Bitcoin transaction which closes out your LN channel by paying their address instead of an address via a payment channel.

The primary advantage fiat has over Bitcoin is the size of the network that "accepts" it as payment. As more and more merchants and stores accept Bitcoin as a payment option, it undeniably increases Bitcoin's utility and thus makes it a more attractive tool and network.
Now, obviously this is not enough for most people to just up-and-adopt Bitcoin on the spot. No one is arguing that it is.
I would argue that the primary driver of adoption would ultimately most likely be the basically-guaranteed scarcity of the tokens. When faced with an option between an unpredictably- and arbitrarily-inflating money technology versus a predictably-inflating-slowly one, a rational agent would of course opt for the latter option. 
If your entire argument is "average Joe won't care enough to get it off the ground" then I am pleased to tell you that you are fixating on the wrong class of person, and that is what is making Bitcoin adoption seem so ludicrous to you. Adoption, if it takes place, would most likely stem from the sector of society who focuses on potential payment options and weighs the benefits and disadvantages of the various options - the financial sector. You don't care whether you use a credit card or Payment System X - financiers do. And *if* Bitcoin serves their purposes, they will ensure that their customers and clients are migrated to the new payment rails without Average Joes needing to worry about what's happening in the background.
2 years ago, it was ridiculous to conceive of companies like Dell and Microsoft doing *anything* with Bitcoin. Nowadays, it isn't even that surprising when they announce that they are accepting it as a payment option. Now it seems similarly ridiculous to conceive of these big companies accepting **and holding/keeping** Bitcoin as Bitcoin... the goalposts have moved but things *definitely* look better for pro-Bitcoin enthusiasts these days.
Merchant adoption is reducing what used to be a "chicken and egg" problem to more of a "we have a chicken, now we just need to coax eggs out of it" problem. What used to seem impossible is now seeming unlikely **at worst**.

We came up with a new upgraded type of transaction, which allows a bunch of awesome stuff. It allows us to fit way more transactions in each Bitcoin block, in a way more efficient and future-friendly manner than the older transaction types. 
On a technical level, we separate the signatures from the transactions themselves, and save them in a new area of a block (one of the blocks in the blockchain), and by doing so, we get a long list of awesome benefits: more transactions fit in each block (and cost/fee per transaction goes way down), second-layer tech like Lightning Network (allowing millions of transactions per second, instant transaction times, and microtransactions) is massively helped, and technical debt is reduced.
Best of all, if SegWit "activates" (basically if enough mining power upgrades to recognize this new transaction type) it wouldn't have any negative effect on the Bitcoin users who *haven't* upgraded yet. It can be done as a soft fork, which just means it's backwards-compatible. This also means it won't risk any nasty chain splitting business, and is a safe and well tested upgrade path. 
In a nutshell, SegWit is the sane way to scale Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:57:58
Basically BU is set such that it doesn't even check signatures anymore if miners put timestamps older than 30 days on their blocks. That check is just skipped altogether.
Especially when combined with the whole "no activation threshold" aspect of BU (it could conceivably successfully fork the network with just half the hashrate, if a miner mined a block larger than 1MB -- whether they intended to or not), this means that a 51% cartel of miners can spend whatever coins they want.
SegWit requires 95% miner signalling, for one, so it would effectively require full network collusion to be able to disregard the predicate restrictions stipulated in a SegWit-active network, and even then, older UTXOs are not affected at all.
In other words, very very different. Incredibly worse.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:17:59
"Controls 10% of the entire Bitcoin economy" is pretty loaded language.
It is *speculated* that the entity of Satoshi Nakamoto has mined approximately a million coins, and these remain unspent. You're not "controlling 10% of the entire economy" by holding a stash of 10% of the bitcoins entirely stationary. The coins could be entirely inaccessible or perhaps Satoshi never mined more than a couple of blocks (personally I don't believe either of those, but they are possibilities).
"Controls 10% of the economy" seems to imply that Satoshi is affecting the markets in any way at all, like he's some bully superwhale who dictates the price of a bitcoin on his whims.

@_date: 2014-03-06 05:58:30
You seem to have put in a serious amount of thought into this, so I respect what you're saying on the matter. My main point of contention:


Call me crazy, but I'm still convinced Bitcoin realizes more financial efficiency than alternative systems, even with intermediaries and regulations tossed in the mix. It is an adaptive protocol designed and optimized for digital transactions, and digital transactions are only getting more and more prevalent (even in PoS contexts the databases need regular digital syncing for obvious reason). As tired as the metaphor may be, Bitcoin is the email to the finance sector's postal service. Sure, the old way (snail mail) will still be used, but communication via email (designed *for* Internet communication) is, for most intents and purposes, superior. In the same way, Bitcoin's cyber-centric design may ultimately prove superior to other more antiquated networks.
I cannot rigorously support this belief of mine, so perhaps I'm wrong and just overly optimistic about a new technology I'm interested (and invested) in. But the impression I have is that this thing *will* be better (cheaper, more flexible, more robust, and fairer) than those systems which preceded it.

@_date: 2014-04-20 20:27:09
First off, I want to say thanks for the great points all around. Very well responded.


Ok, agreed, and my perspective is that it would slow enough as to not cripple the economy.


And if output rapidly grows, that means that the economy is doing fantastic (despite the evils of deflation)! **Fantastic: that's best case scenario** (and now everyone with a positive net worth is rightfully richer for it).




[Here is one source.](
[Metrics from BitPay]( show that consumption increases during the times [when Bitcoin is bubbling]( I remember Coinbase releasing similar statistics though I'm having trouble digging that source up, I'm afraid.
The reasoning behind consumption increasing during times of deflation in Bitcoin is [the wealth effect]( so a strong case could be made that in the long run, as deflation tapers off, [this may not continue to hold as true]( but for now it's some interesting food-for-thought at the very least.


Wait, what? Why would aggregate supply "undeniably have to fall"? This seems deniable to me.


Borrow, or *save*. Saving money is really not a viable option in a rampantly-unpredictably-inflationary economy such as we "enjoy" today, so it's difficult to conceptualize the paradigm shift fully from our perspective, but the deflationary context would not mean that people can no longer afford to buy things, it just means that they wouldn't be taking out loans quite-so-recklessly to do so.


This raises an interesting point, which I've seen a number of articles mention recently: what about in a world where a fair chunk of people trade in Bitcoin but prices are still denominated in other (fiat) currencies (i.e. what is beginning to happen now)? Prices can remain "stable" as denominated in the mother-currency, and Bitcoin/crypto can operate fine as a conduit for payment/savings... but it wouldn't likely ever be the sole unit of account (at least not until it's accepted as tender for taxes - which it very probably never will be).
It seems to me that being positioned as a secondary currency essentially mitigates all the downsides that Bitcoin would otherwise be forced to suffer from, to a large degree.


[Wages are surprisingly sticky, actually]( so it's [likely]( that increasing unemployment would be a worse problem than falling wages. I'll try not to go too far off the deep end here, but regarding unemployment, I'm not even convinced rising unemployment is a bad thing. That's an argument for another day, though.
Regarding the rest of your final paragraph, I fully understand the logic behind the "deflationary spiral" scenario. I understand it but unfortunately disagree with the analysis, because it seems to me to presuppose that high levels of debt are necessary for a functioning economy. Debt is not evil of itself, and certainly plays a role in terms of efficient capital allocation in a healthy economy, but I do believe that the current "borrow borrow borrow" status quo is not the most desirable possible setup. I believe debt is overemphasized today precisely *because* of these mistaken mainstream economic fallacies that have ruled monetary policies for the past 70 years, which fortunately Bitcoin is forcing society to re-examine right now (as evidenced, in part, by the discussion you and I are having at this moment).
In any case, as it stands, inflation robs the working class (relatively speaking) because they have the least amount of capital available to invest in ventures that will outperform the rate of inflation, whereas wealthy individuals are capable of creating portfolios that keep pace with or beat the rate of monetary-growth. The ability of a lower-income individual to sell themselves (and/or their family) into debt bondage to obfuscate this process is not actually helping those workers in the long run, in my opinion.

Happy to oblige:
The most-cumulative-difficulty valid chain.
Which, of course, places the onus entirely on the word "valid", and to understand the comprehensive definition of that, you'll need to go read the source code directly. To list a few "validity requirements" off the top of my head, transactions must respect their script predicates (and UTXOs must be wholly incapable of successful transferance otherwise), coinbase transactions must respect the 50-coins-bitshifted-every-210k-blocks issuance caps, and proof-of-work must be the sole consensus convergence mechanism (though of course it doesn't necessarily have to be double-SHA-256).

I'm not really sure what you're struggling to say here, to be honest. However, it's a fact that the blockchain requires transaction fees to supplant inflation subsidies over time if it is to maintain token finitude and survive over the long term. There has never been any alternative mechanism suggested by which mining incentives can remain in place and serve their purpose.

A hard fork *does* necessarily introduce *some* categorical risk; namely, any Bitcoin user that (directly or indirectly) relies on a node which fails to upgrade in a timely manner is going to be imminently at risk of defraudation (most notably via double-expenditure). Upgrade inertia is a real thing; to quote Shaolin Fry: "Upgrade inertia in inevitable for widely deployed software and can be seen for example, with Microsoft Windows. At the time of writing 5.72% of all Microsoft Windows installations are still running Windows XP, despite mainstream support ending in 2009 and being superseded by 4 software generations, Vista, 7, 8 and 10." Granted, in the case of Bitcoin there is a clear overriding financial incentive to keep up-to-date when major changes are released, but even within Bitcoin we can see significant numbers of nodes running years-old client implementations (*even though they are being continually network-alerted of the dangers and security risks of doing so!*).
If you believe that scaling and capacity are important Bitcoin issues, then you also believe that *even when it comes to important issues*, nodes and miners can take a long time to upgrade their software to address or mitigate those issues. In other words, despite the existence of a multitude of capacity-increasing client solutions -- from Bitcoin XT to Classic to Unlimited to Core 0.13.1+ -- many nodes and miners appear to require a considerable duration of time before successfully upgrading. These same nodes/miners would be at *real risk of financial loss* in the event of a chain-split or hard-fork.
Maybe some are just not paying enough attention to Bitcoin. Maybe some do pay attention, but wind up confused by misinformation (I think we both agree that there's a lot of it out there!) and don't upgrade correctly or properly. Maybe some aren't smart enough to know *how* to upgrade, even if they wanted to. Maybe some are just way behind in terms of technical debt and all their myriad projects, and just don't have time to perform perfect maintenance of their Bitcoin nodes. Maybe some are just scared of making the "wrong" decision, and have decision paralysis. Maybe there are other considerations, I could keep going for days coming up with examples. The point is, there are a variety of reasons why people might need time to upgrade. Anyone who accidentally uses Bitcoin even slightly naively (which is notoriously easy to do, unfortunately) would be at *real* risk of financial loss in a hard-fork scenario. That's an unfortunate reality that we have to recognize.
This is not to say that we should avoid hard forks no matter what, though. It just means that, if we want to perform a hard fork, we should bear in mind the risks to people who, for whatever reason, wind up in situations where they are using an older node to interact with the Bitcoin network. By definition, that older node would now be incompatible with the current chain. We have to account for this, in one way or another.

In other words, I addressed the argument on its own terms (and tore it apart) while also pointing out that Nick Szabo is a renowned thinker in this space, and is worth listening to when it comes to Bitcoin engineering.

One of the aspects which helped to enlighten me on these matters was how *blatantly dumb and hostile* one subreddit turned out to be, and how reasonable and intelligent the other has been in comparison. 
When the noise is filtered out from the signal, it helps streamline a lot of progress and research.


And? I don't think Bitcoin needs SegWit to thrive and grow. SegWit is an unambiguously good thing which would improve Bitcoin in a very safe and clever way, but there are no problems with Bitcoin right now and I'm perfectly happy with the network as it is. I understand how mining works, and how transaction fees work, and I appreciate that if fast confirmation is a priority, I must outbid the median fee-rate offered by the market at the time of my transaction. I accepted this social contract many years ago when I decided to buy my bitcoins, and I'm not upset that it is what it has always been.


In principle, what is the exact difference between the promotion of dickpills and the promotion of network-hostile software?
It seems like the point may have gone over your head. Think about it some more.

ByzCoin is unfortunately a replacement for Bitcoin's consensus model, as is Bitcoin NG. There is a good deal of obfuscation on this matter (which is slightly different but fundamentally equivalent for both of them), but suffice to say they are radical deviations from the Nakamoto Consensus model (much  like Bitcoin Unlimited is). I do appreciate that Bitcoin NG could technically be implemented as a soft fork, by repurposing normal blocks as keyblocks, but make no mistake, it would be a new coin altogether.
I'm not ruling out the possibility that Bitcoin metamorphosizes over time into something very different from its original state (how Satoshi designed it). But personally I am extremely suspicious of repackaged BFT consensus algorithms that masquerade as "Bitcoin 2.0" without any seeming appreciation for Satoshi's crucial contribution(s) to the space.
I might be off on a tangent at this point. If so, I apologize.

I'm also not sure that the top holders of Bitcoin were Silk Road drug lords  and exorbitantly successful scam-artists like you seem to be suggesting here... I'd guess that more coins are held by technophile (and likely libertarian) miners who happened to chance across it in the early days. I'm not exactly sure what sort of blockchain forensics would be necessary to prove or disprove this point though. It's all just speculation in these matters, really.

There is no possible utility to sending thousands of small transactions from Address A to Address B and then directly back to Address A before repeating the process, which is what we're seeing on the network.

Ok, you want underlying reasons?
Supply, demand, and the intersection of the two.
That is how value is determined. Economics. Wonderful science. You should look into it.
So, first: supply. Less than 13 million total, and an ultimate hard cap of 21M. Easy stuff.
Next, demand. You have already agreed that this is a superior form of money to all existing alternatives. What is the ultimate global demand for **the best money in existence** likely to be, when all is said and done? Essentially infinite. Right now, of course, most people are wary because Bitcoin sounds too good to be true and really only surviving the test of time can prove to the population that it really is a legitimate idea (most people are simply not educated enough in the right arenas to be able to make the necessary syntheses to understand the system in its entirety, unfortunately) so we are still in a wild phase of the asset's price discovery. But if you think demand for *better money* is going to be thousands of times smaller in magnitude than the demand for individual state-issued currencies and precious metals, in the end, it is *you* who must explain your reasoning to me. In short, that claim is absurd.
I was unaware that you were asking for a crash course in economics, because my assumption is that people understand how prices of assets are determined and the basics of supply and demand. To me, these are trivial truths and thus somewhat taken for granted and certainly not mentioned in 3-paragraph reddit posts initially, because if I have to start from square one and teach highschool-level economics before making a point, odds are that I wind up with an unnecessary wall-of-text that no one wants or needs to read.  Apparently you're still trying to put the concepts together, or you have a somewhat fanatical obsession with rigor. If you need further assistance, I won't be bothering to type much more up because frankly I don't see the point, but I'll be happy to point you in the direction of a bunch of Wikipedia articles to get you started. Like I said, economics is a wonderful and fascinating science, so you may even want to Google it on your own time.
So, please, before embarrassing yourself further, shut that mouth and maybe get some research under your belt.

No, you're not getting something for doing nothing. The only way to benefit from deflation is to acquire wealth in the first place. If you don't have any, deflation doesn't help you. Conversely, the more you have, the more benefits you reap from the natural deflation. 
So in a healthy deflationary model, everyone reaps the benefits of their own input multiplied by their patience in expenditure.


That's a somewhat-good way to put it. 


No, no it doesn't. Centralized theft means that the wealth accumulates in the hands of a select privileged few. Decentralized giving means that the more that we achieve as a species, the more that *everyone* benefits. We're not robbing one another to realize these benefits; the benefits are a natural result of our growing prosperity as a species, distributed as evenly as possible. So if you happen to innovate in such a way that helps the total output of Mankind, you not only help yourself, you help *everyone else in the economy* in a marginal way simultaneously. You're not taking wealth from anyone - in fact, you're doing the opposite.

The developers are the only ones who *did* uphold their end of the bargain. Luke-Jr released hard fork candidate code a couple months after SegWit was released. Promise kept.
However, *the miners* reneged on their end of the bargain. Multiple pools started running non-Core-compatible software shortly after the "Hong Kong Agreement" was made, *in direct violation of the agreement*.
You have things exactly backwards.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:44:04


Because blocks are, on average, well under 1 MB currently.


There aren't that many transactions. There's no need for blocks larger than that right now. When there's a need, obviously this will be changed.
Again, if you're having trouble making a transaction, I'd be happy to help. You're certainly doing something wrong.

Ok. Normally, I would cram everything into one giant wall-of-text comment, but I have historically been very disappointed by the results of this approach, because (I think) it is a little bit "overwhelming" to the other party, and because it seems to invite responses which only target one or two inconsequential statements that I make, ignoring the bulk of the comment and leaving it unaddressed and unacknowledged. 
I'm going to try a new approach here, but I worry it will be kind of annoying... basically, I'm going to list out each point I want to make in a separate comment reply. I'll number them so that the logical ordering is clear. The downside of this approach is that it might still be overwhelming (though perhaps in a different way) and it could conceivably be very obnoxious from your perspective (I could see a dozen orangered envelopes waiting for you when you wake up being really irritating). I apologize in advance if this is an annoying way to go about this (and if you happen to see this message before signing off for the night, and would really rather me consolidate things into one comment, let me know).

Finally, we have UnlimitedCoin. UnlimitedCoin replaces Nakamoto Consensus with Emergent Consensus, which is a completely new model with a completely and fundamentally different approach to consensus. Many of Satoshi's original assumptions for Bitcoin are violated and new ones (sometimes explicit, sometimes not) are introduced to replace them.
In particular, by allowing miner coalitions to control validity settings and accordant operating cost requirements of all network nodes, Unlimited introduces completely new attack vectors and a completely new (almost entirely untested save for one self-destructed testnet) consensus construct. Satoshi's clearly-outlined limitations of a 51% attacker (in the whitepaper) are suddenly no longer sufficient, and 51% attackers have significantly more power at their disposal in an Unlimited environment. Furthermore, incentives in such a context are aligned to *encourage* adversarial behavior in the short-term.
Once again, Unlimited has not bothered to concentrate on actual competent developer support. This time it is an entirely-closed governance model, where selectively-allowed "members" are allowed to participate but outsiders are not. It is (once again) primarily intended as a power coup, rather than an actual technical solution. Almost all vulnerabilities (those that the blocksize limit is currently mitigating as well as those that might manifest in the event of a chain-fork) are completely ignored and brushed under the rug, with an attitude that can be summarized as "eventually everything will sort itself out" even when empirical evidence appears to contradict this perspective. Risks of increased orphan rates (which are literally anathema to Bitcoin's proper operation) are similarly disregarded. 
Many have [expressed concerns]( about [the effects]( that [Unlimited might have]( over [the long term]( I could dig up a dozen links like this, but I'm sure you've seen them all. The point is that a lot of smart people (who you may or may not disagree with) have evaluated the Unlimited consensus model (or lack thereof, depending on who you ask) and determined that it is too risky and too radical a departure from the original Nakamoto Consensus model (and the status quo social contract currently enforced on the network).

And thus you are the one making the claim. You're claiming that the pattern will deviate. I'm laughing at you (out loud) as you struggle more and more, tightening your own noose with each response. I'm awaiting your arguments that adoption with curtail, and you're (quite pitiably) trying to sidestep the provisioning thereof by alleging that the burden of proof (of some mysterious claim that you seem to be under the impression that I made at some point) is on me.

@_date: 2017-02-24 17:57:29


Yes, I have. Unfortunately that post (like many of the anti-SegWit posts I've read) was almost wholly inaccurate and appears to have been written as a political piece rather than a technical one. As a software engineer, when I read it, I was shaking my head the whole time, severely disappointed with all of the inaccuracies and misrepresentations.
I think it's highly unfortunate that the subject here is so technical, because it makes it really hard for people who don't write/maintain software to accurately assess what is true and what is false when they read articles and breakdowns about it.
Just to clear up the two misconceptions brought up here:


This is not actually true. SegWit would not incur any such risk.


This is similarly not true; there would be no security disadvantages for pre-SegWit nodes, because they would only relay/accept/recognize SegWit transactions after they were confirmed (included in a block already). They would still be able to validate everything relevant about the transaction (the non-witness-data) from their perspective, and so there are no contexts or scenarios in which they take on *any* extra security risks when it comes to SegWit transactions. The only disadvantage from the old nodes' perspective when it comes to SegWit transactions wouldn't have to do with security... it would just be that they don't "see" SegWit transactions until after they are mined/confirmed. In other words, unconfirmed SegWit transactions are invisible to pre-SegWit nodes. Fortunately this doesn't mean that these nodes are in *any* risk whatsoever. 
One more note on this subject, which I think you'll appreciate, if you're concerned with the perspective of un-upgraded nodes: with a hard fork, **all** un-upgraded nodes are in **serious** danger and take on massive security risks. In fact, in the event of a successful hard fork, it is almost guaranteed that older (incompatible) nodes would be double-spent against and defrauded. In other words, if you're worried about how things look from older nodes' perspective, then a hard fork is the worst thing possible.
Another common misconception that I'd like to take a moment to address is the idea that SegWit would somehow be "cleaner" or "simpler" as a hard fork. This is completely untrue, though. In fact, from a programming perspective, doing it as a hard fork would require much *more* protectionary code and would be significantly more complex in many ways. It's always bugged me to see people say that a softfork version of SegWit would create more "technical debt" because this is completely untrue and has no basis at all.
Anyway, I'll stop throwing SegWit information at you! Just thought you might be interested to hear another side to things, from the perspective of a coder rather than an entrepreneur or politician. Have a good day from here!
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:27:51
We don't need uncompromising immutability, nor do we need an authority to decide for us. We run the code we support, and encourage others to do the same, and our code does the rest (in particular, it respects the consensus parameters and validity checks that it is programmed to adhere to). 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:29:54
Here's your explanation: the *current* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar is as a speculative investment that stands a (great) chance of appreciating immensely in value as the network grows in magnitude.
The *future* appeal of Bitcoin over the dollar (and the driving factor of the above-listed contingency) is that it is likely to ultimately be cheaper, easier, and more versatile to transact with after the network has matured.
Of course converting back and forth for every transaction is irrational. That's not the end-game. 
An analogy here should hopefully help, though I suspect from your question that you will roll your eyes at it: "Can someone please explain to me why the average American would want to use automobiles instead of horses? They cost more, they're slower, they're more dangerous, the gas they run on is harder to procure than hay, and they're confusing!" Of course they are, at first. Technology needs time to mature.

Not only did you miss the point, but you managed to cram multiple false claims into one tiny packet of misinformation. 


Not only is this not true, but *it doesn't make any sense*. 
Bitcoin *has* to have a persistent transaction backlog in the mempool awaiting confirmation, otherwise it can't survive as fees supplant the block reward over the next decade or so. So having transactions waiting confirmation doesn't mean Bitcoin is "full" (which, again, *does not make sense*), it means that Bitcoin is generating sufficient demand to continue operating successfully. Your inability to make a fee-free transaction does not mean Bitcoin is "full" at all.


*What* bloat?


I am a developer, and I say that almost everything that you've said in your comment here is nonsense. I say otherwise.
 
Check and mate.


It already has. I have made Bitcoin transactions from multiple different countries. 
**And let me repeat myself: none of this is germane to the point at hand, which is that multiple cryptocurrencies do not in any way help with blockchain scaling tradeoffs.** So even though I took a moment to debunk all your bullshit here, let us not forget that *none of it was relevant anyway*.

Sounds good to me, but I'm a non-mining user, so I don't have a means of "un-filling" them now.

Ever since v0.10.0 when libsecp256k1 was implemented, syncing with the client directly is actually faster than using a bootstrap.dat torrent in most cases. Since speed gains were the sole benefit of using a torrent in the first place, there's no longer a good reason to support it, so it's effectively been ignored for a little over a year now.
I don't think it's particularly "unsafe" beyond being unsupported these days, but it's not very useful any more.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:54:40
The final sentence of my comment touches on the issue here, which is that a bloated UTXO set increases the block validation time. No way around that. Even Gavin's article says as much.


No, it limits UTXO growth by preventing excessive numbers of outputs from being generated, and with solutions like SegWit it would limit it further by aligning incentives further towards minimization of such bloat. It doesn't actually make Bitcoin any harder or more expensive to use.

He never said otherwise. But larger-than-micropayment on-chain settlement fee rates don't preclude micropayments at all. Read up on the Lightning Network.


What? No. You are severely confused, seemingly on a number of points.


This betrays another deep misunderstanding. It *has* to be expensive to mine a block, that is literally how Bitcoin consensus is achieved and maintained. If the equipment necessary to append to the blockchain were cheap, that would *necessarily* mean that Bitcoin is insecure and that consensus is easily subverted.
It is incredible how much you managed to get wrong in just a few short sentences. Almost impressive.

No, you are massively misrepresenting reality. The ten comments I wrote which preceded this one were meant to demonstrate *why* so many Core developers (*not* just Luke-Jr and Greg, who I have explicitly mentioned are merely the "low hanging fruit" that the opposition likes to target without bothering to acknowledge that almost every other developer in the space has expressed similar concerns). Please re-read  where this was **directly** addressed.


Yes, by definition, almost. But the problem is that most of the Core developers *don't* approve an ugly kick-the-can hard fork (for the reasons mentioned in my previous comments, and more) and would prefer a clean and elegant and risk-minimizing solution like SegWit instead.
Please go back and read the comment prior to this one ( It addresses this directly, and I feel that skipping it or ignoring what I said there is really preventing a true dialogue in this case.


I'm not sure you can proclaim with authority exactly what factors were most critical in the survival of the ETC fork. Certainly the contentiousness of the bailout (and the total sacrifice of the "code is law" tenet that had been Ethereum's entire purpose up until that point) at least had *some* impact on the situation.


Yes, but I would argue that this is because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum has a dictator and has proven its total centralization in the series of hard forks that he mandated last year. Naturally, the offshoot of a centralized project without the central dictator's blessing is going to be fighting an uphill battle in many ways.


Market-determined transaction confirmation times and increasing fees are both part of Bitcoin's social construct and have been since the very beginning. This is just a fact, like it or not. Perhaps the world will not ascribe great value to Bitcoin as a result of this fact, but I don't believe that it is as doomed as all that.


There is no development gridlock, though. My series of comments here has made that abundantly clear, I would hope. There has been massive progress made on scaling Bitcoin, and the Core developers have delivered everything that they had hoped to on the Roadmap, save for the pending flex-caps (which won't and shouldn't be implemented until we have some data regarding how the network handles larger blocks). 
It is not *development gridlock* that is stymying capacity. It is *miner* gridlock, at this point. In just two short weeks we could see a more-than-double capacity upgrade go live on mainnet... but apparently the miners are not particularly interested in increased capacity in the immediate short term.

No, it works, period. When it needs to scale, the incentives are aligned so that it will.

No, he released a hard fork BIP that literally *just* dealt with blocksizes. It increased the blocksize to 31MB over time, if I'm not mistaken.
It sounds like you haven't been keeping up here. Go do some research, and you owe me an apology when you get back.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:37:27
The blocksize limit is not the only hard-coded constant in Bitcoin's consensus construct. If we were to increase it without making any other changes, [malicious megatransactions]( could be exploited by enterprising miners in potentially catastrophic ways. From the link:


These sorts of vulnerabilities can be addressed in different ways. For example, [Gavin introduced a new MAX_BLOCK_SIGHASH limit]( in Bitcoin Classic, to attempt to plug it up... which was later removed when it caused a fork on the "big blocks testnet" where UnlimitedCoin was falsely signaling BIP109 adherence. This means that neither Classic nor Unlimited currently sport such a limit (which means that they are vulnerable to such attacks), but assuming that they *did*, it would mean one more arbitrary constant value that we would have to coordinate. It would (at minimum) represent additional technical debt.
In short, because of how sighash operations on traditional transactions scale quadratically, nasty things can happen with bigger blocks that can't happen with smaller ones. Just another thing to keep in mind, and another "security hole" to worry about addressing and working on.

The neat thing about 1000% increases is you can pull out 150% of your initial investment and still store the rest in the investment itself to continue the ride.

Their relative percentage of the wealth is preserved by definition, yes.
Their absolute wealth discrepancy is exacerbated, of course. And this is most definitely relevant. It's not some entirely ignorable aspect that we can forget about.
It's like if the government issued tax rebates or some sort of rewards program, and the richer you were the more benefits they gave you. "Well the percentage return matches the relative net worth of the participants! The rich get more returns because they had more to begin with!" is your argument. 
You have 100 peercoins, I have 1. When PoS gives us our rewards, now you have 110 and I have 1.1. It is no solace to me that our *percentage return* is equivalent; I am still getting 0.1 peercoins when you are getting 10. Why do you deserve 9.9 more than me? You did not earn them with productivity. You surely need them less than I do, because you're already prospering in comparison to me.
I understand that it doesn't skew the percentages, of course. It skews the absolute difference in wealth between the rich and the poor. Don't pretend like that's a non-issue. It's a glaring weakness in the system. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:26:49


Where did I say that was "all" it does? It solves transaction malleability, provides a linearly-serializable transaction format (no more quadratic sighash scaling!) and segregates witness data from the rest of the block into a prunable structure. It's a "kill many birds with one stone" kind of solution.


A hard fork to 4MB would likely require much more code than SegWit, and be much more complex. You're not an engineer, I see.


Well, I mean, it literally **is** a blocksize increase. 


Yes, a literal blocksize increase is also an effective blocksize increase.


It's a one-time upgrade that lays the foundation for numerous other capacity-yielding updates. For instance, Schnorr signatures could reduce transaction sizes by 40%, which SegWit would make possible and straightforward to implement. Not to mention LN.


Funny that you say that. The practical increase that SegWit would likely result in (the equivalent of a hard fork increase to 2.1MB blocks) is *larger* than the original Bitcoin Classic proposal tried to effect. Of course, these days Classic is just a clone of BU with Zander's personal fiddlings merged in.


It's not arbitrary, and it is an objective *improvement* over the old imbalanced transaction weight calculation. Do you need help understanding this component?


No it's not. You've been drinking too much Kool-Aid. To understand code, listen to actual engineers, not politicians.


And yet your comments here tell a different story. :)


Again, you're missing the point. Essentially, you're trying to argue that "two plus two equals five" and when I am helpfully correcting your math, you're saying "well one day we might use the word 'five' to refer to the concept of 4, because language is ever-evolving!" which is technically true but entirely irrelevant, not to mention incredibly silly.

In a perfect and utopian world, perhaps.
In practice, governments and their actions often do *not* represent the general will of society. A quick glance through history would yield you hundreds of instances in which a despotic arrangement surfaced that essentially subverts society and instead caters to the will of a select few elite.
I will not argue that government represents *nothing* societal. It is a facet of society, of course. I will adamantly refuse to accept the premise that governments represent the totality (or even the generality) of societal sentiment or will.
Republics (democratic or not) cannot be esteemed as perfect reflections of society's desires. On paper, perhaps. In reality, not so much.

Just because you're using colored coins doesn't mean you're magically insulated from risk. 
It seems to me that you don't understand how colored coins work (or perhaps it's the security model of Bitcoin in general that you misunderstand). Basically, if you want to represent value in the Bitcoin network in some way (be it via plain old satoshis or colored coins or whatever), then you are accepting the risks of the blockchain. As a simple example, double-spending is a threat to take into consideration. Anything that causes bitcoins to lose 90% of their value overnight is likely going to have corresponding negative effects on your colored coin.
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:29:29

@_date: 2015-05-08 18:41:57
No, that's absolutely incorrect. Price can absolutely go down as adoption increases.
As a hypothetical, to help you understand how, imagine that only 2 people use Bitcoin: Satoshi and Hal Finney. Both have a million coins. Satoshi buys a burger off of Hal for 1 BTC, meaning the "market price" of 1 BTC is now about $3-5.
Now imagine that Hal starts telling all his friends about Bitcoin, and they're all interested. Many of them want to buy the bitcoins that Hal has to offer, but none of them feel like they're worth $5 each. Since Hal has so many coins, and really wants this Bitcoin thing to take off, he decides to sell his friends some of his coins for $2 each. About 100 friends take him up on his offer.
Bitcoin has just been adopted massively, compared to where it used to be, but the market price fell.
It's not that hard to understand: price does **not** directly reflect adoption. Other factors and variables are at play.
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:16:22
The "time to confirm" doesn't necessarily go up. You can pay a higher fee and have a next-block confirmation.
But other than that, yes, that's right. 
In case you weren't aware, we have discovered that there *has* to be a continual backlog of transactions in order for Bitcoin to survive the medium or long term (more than a decade or so). If there were no transactions waiting for confirmation, the whole thing will break as the mining rewards dwindle to negligibility.
So, again, where is the problem? Transactions waiting to confirm is *a good thing* and absolutely *necessary* for Bitcoin to keep working.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:03:45

More people using Bitcoin is exactly what "increased adoption" is. You might argue that "Bitcoin adoption isn't important" -- in fact, that's exactly what you're doing -- but you really can't argue that "More people using Bitcoin isn't more Bitcoin adoption" because, definitionally speaking, that's completely incorrect.
If you're just thinking in terms of "what affects price" then adoption does play a role, but only as an intermediary determinant of both demand and network utility (both of which it has an eventual positive influence on).
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:41:37
Pssst... Your Intel pool would be part of the network...
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:59:53


Yes. For instance, if you have seen your transaction confirmed by 6 blocks, it is an almost-mathematical-certainty that it will not be reversed without a catastrophic network-wide failure. 
Also, if your private key is generated in a suitably random way, it is an almost-mathematical-certainty that no one else will happen to generate that same private key to steal your funds.
These components are not incentive-based. They rely on maths and maths alone.


Of course we are relying on (or trusting) people to follow rational incentives to a degree. If miners everywhere decide to sabotage the network despite this being against their best interests, the Bitcoin network and community is in for a world of hurt.
You're also relying on people following rational incentives when you assume that tomorrow you will not have a nuclear bomb dropped on your head, or when you cut someone else off in traffic and they don't deliberately crash into your car for revenge. There are an infinite number of contingencies that could play out in any scenario. But most of these are such remote possibilities that they don't demand a great deal of concern. Self-sabotaging miners is an example of something possible but incredibly unlikely.

Lightning Network is basically ready, at this point, but for production usage we are waiting for SegWit to activate. SegWit is an update that roughly doubles the blocksize, but more importantly it will allow a new type of non-malleable transaction that would allow LN to work properly. It's ready and released, but currently a little less than 1/4 of the miners are signalling for SegWit to activate, so it's just sitting there waiting for more to do so.
Once 95% of miners signal support, SegWit would activate, and then LN can be used and start having an effect.
However, like I said, a little less than 25% of miners are signaling for SegWit even though it's tested and ready. If it's such a good improvement to Bitcoin and would allow such great increases in scalability, why aren't they all rushing to signal support already?
1) When blocks are full, we all pay more fees (because we're competing over limited space). These higher fees go straight to the miners, so it's not necessarily in a miner's best short-term interests to increase the blocksize with SegWit and allow more transactions (with smaller fees) to fit in their blocks. 
2) Things have gotten really nasty and really political over the past couple years. There is a movement of people who oppose SegWit because it was developed by the Bitcoin Core developers, who they feel aren't good people (for strange conspiracy reasons that I won't go into here). These people have been meeting with miners and swarming message boards for months to try and demonize SegWit, so they might be having an impact and slowing down adoption of it. It's important to note that there are no technical issues with SegWit (it is an obvious upgrade), the opposition is purely political.
So, in short, we could have LN working in 2 weeks if the miners would upgrade their software to support it. But they are generally not in a rush to do so, for the reasons above.
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:57:16


They *don't* need to upgrade. **That is the entire point!** I can't believe how confused you are here.


This is not possible. Again, that is the point. A **hard fork** opens up old un-upgraded nodes to vulnerabilities and attacks. A soft fork like SegWit does not.
You are deeply, thoroughly confused.


No, not necessarily, at all. For instance, BU doesn't even have an "activation period" or even an "activation threshold" in any sense, and at no point is any form of notification sent to any older, incompatible nodes. They would continue rejecting blocks they deem incompatible, oblivious to the "need" to upgrade unless they learned of it through some other channel (like social media). 


It is nonexistent. There are no potential attacks you can make on older nodes. You are severely confused and making yourself look more and more ignorant with every sentence you write.
Also, this is *exactly* why Satoshi wrote and Incorporated the Script language in the first place. [He explained, directly, that this was how Bitcoin was designed to be upgraded](










This isn't "a clear danger to the owners of those nodes" at all, this was literally the upgrade path that Satoshi advocated, and the one we have all been planning on following since the very beginning.

The counterpoint being that the wealthy don't hold most of their net worth as cash (they apportion it among assets which yield returns) while the impoverished unfortunately lack the opportunity/luxury of doing so.
Meanwhile, in a deflationary environment, even though wealth discrepancy *is* exacerbated (and the rich do get richer), the poor should theoretically also get richer as long as they can stash a small portion of their earnings as basic savings. In other words, the primary difference is that poor people would not need to expend time and effort evaluating investment opportunities to benefit from macro-level economic growth and prosperity. They would by default hold a sort of "generic worldwide index fund" in the form of their money itself.


Savvy creditors take this into account, though, and stipulate the terms of the loans they make accordingly. It's not like a debtor has a secret "ace up their sleeve" with the ongoing inflationary reduction of real debt; in most cases it is factored in when the loan is made. Accordingly, no actual benefits to the poor should result from this process.


This is an interesting thought experiment. I don't think the "ideal economy" you describe is in stable equilibrium, because no creditors should rationally want to be paid back in the inflationary currency, if given the option and all else is equal. Demand for the deflationary currency (again, *ceteris paribus*) should ultimately dwarf that for the inflationary one, and eventually this effect should compound until one of the monies basically dies... 
I hesitate to say this would be an example of Gresham's Law playing out, but it would be something along similar lines.

**Everyone else**: That's not really a good argument in favor of A. Why, specifically, do you think A is better than B?
**You**: Because B has more technical debt.
**Everyone else**: It doesn't, though. That's what the diagram demonstrates.

Yeah, true. It's a guilty pleasure of mine. I used to stop by and poke at the denizens of all the time, but that got boring when most of them migrated to rbtc. Nowadays I stop by there sometimes, for two reasons:
1) If anyone *can* make a sound argument or point that contradicts my existing perspective, I always want to hear it out and give it its due. It's highly unfortunate that almost no one in rbtc appears to even have a rudimentary technical understanding of Bitcoin, though, so it's very rare that my opinion is enriched by my visits there. As you observed, it's mainly just me killing brain cells, flimsy arguments and conspiracy theories, and time.
2) Sometimes it's fun to embody the internet equivalent of a full-grown man slapboxing an army of toddlers. Like I said, guilty pleasure.


Not sure what condescension has to do with a technical (or even semantic) discussion, sounds like a deliberate change of subject to me (maybe even an ad hominem). 
Again, your final paragraph of the comment I was referring to *does not make sense*. It looks like you *might* be trying to argue that SegWit un-solves Satoshi's Byzantine solution, which is flatly untrue as it works within the consensus constraints as specified by Satoshi. If you are confused further on this point, I would be happy to help you understand whatever it is that you're missing, but you'll have to meet me halfway and try your best to pinpoint exactly what it is that's confusing you.

Unfortunately I don't think there exists a solution that can satisfy everyone. I remember being *so* excited when SegWit was proposed as a soft fork at Scaling Bitcoin in late 2015, because we finally had something everyone could unite behind. It seems that a few months later, sadly, politics got involved... from my experience, most people who oppose SegWit oppose it because they don't like the programmers who wrote it. Almost everyone is fine with the code itself.

@_date: 2017-02-02 18:57:06


Not only is that not an "issue", it is literally [necessary for Bitcoin to survive]( 
In short, when the mining rewards are almost entirely based on transaction fees, miners could (and *should*) greedily ignore eachothers' blocks in an attempt to grab all the juicy transaction fees from the mempool themselves. The only way that Bitcoin could survive this context (or at least the only *known* way) is for there to be a *considerable and persistent* transaction backlog waiting in the mempool, such that there is no dramatic benefit of ignoring other miners' blocks because you can earn a comparable quantity of fees by just grabbing still-waiting transactions from the mempool.
In other words, **not only is the "transactions getting 'stuck' and having to wait for confirmation in the mempool" NOT a bad thing, it is necessary for Bitcoin to be able to work**.


Yes, me too. That's not the same thing as saying "there are scaling issues", which, as I've explained, there are not.

No, I didn't say "it's too much effort to post a simple explanation of the genuine arguments against a hard-fork", I said that it's *a waste of time* because I've already done so in threads you were in, plus you're trolling, and feeding the trolls is not a productive use of time.

You skipped the *actual* arguments for why a hard fork blocksize increase would be dangerous, and took it as an axiom that it would be.
You Buttcoiners and shitcoiners always seem to take great care to avoid acknowledging the actual arguments against a hard fork, and always seem desperate to use hyperbolic language ("It's so Luke-Jr can run a node on a 2001 Nokia phone in Zimbabwe lol!") rather than taking time to understand what the actual risks and technical considerations and nuances are.
It's very clear that none of you have a basic understanding of the tech here, so you inevitably resort to ad hominems and mischaracterizations of your "enemies" (i.e. all the actual developers and engineers).

First things first: "Core" is not some monolithic entitity with a concrete set of desires attributable to it. There are many developers who contribute to Bitcoin Core in various ways, and any "Core wants x" statement is bound to be an oversimplification at best.


It sounds like you're referring to Luke-Jr's BIP, but if so, you are remarkably confused on the details. The hard fork would be done well before 2024. That doesn't mean that blocks larger than 1MB would be treated as valid on the network before 2024, assuming Luke-Jr's proposal were accepted and activated.


Not necessarily. Depends on the details of the hard fork.

@_date: 2015-05-20 22:35:20
Firstly, let us take the quote in context:


if block size increases beyond 20MB.  **Further layers are -- by design
-- necessary if we want to achieve the goal of a decentralized payment
network capable of supporting full global traffic.**


larger value transfers this attaches attendent risk of loss -- as
we've seen in the field time &amp; again.  The world's citizens en masse
will not speak to each other with bitcoin (IP packets), but rather
with multiple layers (HTTP/TCP/IP) that enable safe and secure value
transfer or added features such as instant transactions.
He's saying "blockchain transactions are analogous to IP packets and other layers on top of it will, by design, handle subsets of its traffic" - not your ridiculous misrepresentation which is something like "Bitcoin will never scale". 
It's grossly disingenuous to pretend like your interpretation is even cursorily reasonable. 
Furthermore, we can already today observe with empirical dispassion a few examples of these additional "layers" - all intra-service transactions (e.g. those through Coinbase and Circle) require no blockchain settlement, and innovations like payments-channels (for instance, Lightning Network) make it pretty obvious that scaling the network isn't some insurmountable challenge; it's merely an interesting opportunity for those who want to expand this experiment.
It's pretty clear you're just here to troll, though, so I think I'm going to step off my soap box and call it a day.
If you ever want to have a serious discussion, I'm certainly willing.
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:37:41
Yeah, perpetual inflation (and the removal of the 21M coin cap) is the only potential solution other than a persistent transaction backlog.
Basically, if you support BU or blocksize increases as a response to rising fees, you are implicitly supporting removing the 21M coin limit in Bitcoin. It'd be nice to see this acknowledged more often.

A hard fork can of course induce risk to SegWit users (just as it can induce risk for non-SegWit users). A hard fork could, for instance, reallocate all coins in addresses that start with "1Ab..." to new addresses. There are no limitations on what a hard fork is capable of, because it would represent a *protocol replacement*. As such, one can incur arbitrary risk vectors.

I just wanted to say, from how you write it seems like you're a very pleasant person. I like you.
Looks like you've already figured out what you needed, but I wanted to throw in the obligatory reminder to Never Invest More Than You Can Afford To Lose. As long as you follow that rule, you can sleep easy with the long term perspective in mind no matter what the price is doing in the meantime. Watching the price drop when you're holding coins is a sinking feeling, no doubt, and (as they say in Dune), Fear is the Mind-Killer. It's hard to appreciate just how compelling fear is until you are actually experiencing the feeling of a plummeting price... but as long as you haven't invested past your risk-tolerance threshold, you'll be able to get through the fear-noise.

Since no one has provided you the real answer in all 79 comments so far, I will:
Someone (or multiple someones) with a lot of coins has been strategically dumping them in batches of 4-8k when such dumps would have maximal negative impact on the price. If you watch the exchange order-books (personally I follow Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Huobi most closely) it is very obvious when such dumps occur because the volume bars at the bottom of the page go blood red and shoot upwards, and these are always during periods when the bid-side of the order book is thinnest. 
This has been a tactical beatdown which has lasted weeks at this point. The seller(s) have minimized their own profits from the sales as they deliberately hammer downwards; obviously their desire to see cheaper prices outweighs their desire for direct proceeds, for whatever reason.
Of course, most people are going to shout "tinfoil!" and "conspiratard!" but this is the actual truth of the matter in the markets right now. Order-books don't lie and the data speaks for itself, and on top of that there has been no recent negative news which can reasonably account for massive sell-side pressure. This is the only explanation which withstands any serious scrutiny.
The question then becomes: what is their endgame? If they intend to flip into bullwhale mode in the near future, and gobble up all the cheap coins, wonderful; in that case this is nothing but a buying opportunity. If they're buying up bitcoins in bulk off-exchange and need to have the on-exchange prices as low as possible to net the greatest amount, I'm extremely interested in how they plan to recoup their losses in the end and doubt their ultimate strategy is to just hodl+hope. A tempting hypothesis is that they have been simultaneously shorting Bitcoin as they pummel it downwards, but the Bitfinex statistics do not show a substantial amount of shorts (certainly not enough to counterbalance the foregone profits that trickling out their sales more mercifully would have resulted in), and as far as I'm aware other Bitcon-futures-trading platforms reflect the same thing. Of course, shorting "in the open" like that would betray the strategy preemptively, which could theoretically limit its effectiveness. 
Perhaps the scariest prospect of all is a banking coalition (or some other party which has deemed Bitcoin a serious long-term threat to their hegemony) is willing to expend hundreds of millions of dollars in a prolonged attack on the markets, simply to deter potential new investors/participants from joining the network. If this is the case, they'd likely never shift into "bullwhale" mode because their ultimate goal is to suppress Bitcoin. Fortunately this is also the least-likely and most conspiratorial hypothesis, and personally I don't believe it is the case (though I won't rule it out entirely, since it does align with the sale behavior that has taken place recently).
Someone, or a group of someones, wants the Bitcoin price to be low right now. Hopefully they will shift gears and want it high again in the future, but to date we have no evidence that this is the case. We will, of course, have to wait and see how this plays out.
@_date: 2017-02-02 02:41:19


This is a good thing. Bitcoin's value proposition *relies* on such gridlock. If it were easy to mutate (like centralized coins such as Ethereum are), then the ultimate token finitude would not be "guaranteed" (or as close to it as possible) and the whole thing would be doomed over the long term.
Consensus alterations are not *supposed* to be easy to perform. If any given proposal is non-negligibly contentious, the default action *has* to be "maintain status quo" because underneath it all, this is where the token value derives from.

Yes, that is the sort of misconception that OP is addressing. In other words, he wouldn't write what he wrote above *except to explain why the author of your quote is missing the point*. It is a *response* to that naive perspective, showing exactly what is wrong about it.
Basically, BU has a whole new model of consensus, and it is wildly divergent from the Nakamoto Consensus as implemented in Bitcoin. Nakamoto Consensus is "everyone agree on the rules beforehand, and then proceed forward under the assumptions that these are the rules and that breaking them means **invalidity** (and any financial loss or opportunity cost of doing so)", whereas "Bitcoin" Unlimited is "we can make the rules up as we go, and trust that people will coordinate what rules are best for the network". Essentially, it means that what is *valid* is no longer a concrete or mathematical thing; it is a flimsy, socially malleable concept, a moving target.
A moderately sophisticated understanding of distributed consensus and state machines is, generally, enough to appreciate just how radical of a difference there is between Bitcoin and Unlimited.

Bitcoin can be seen as an opt-in *social contract*, where the status quo consensus rules of the network represent the details of the contract itself. Anyone who is participating in Bitcoin (regardless of their specific manner of participation) has agreed to these rules and their implications. Interpretations of the *intent* behind the rules can vary wildly, but the end result, the *consensus construct* that Bitcoin represents, is precisely codified in the reference implementation (at this time, Bitcoin Core). That is not to say that the construct is necessarily static nor that it cannot evolve over time; it most certainly can. But by using Bitcoin in any capacity, you are effectively saying "I understand that the consensus rules enforced by the network (the majority of which is currently running Bitcoin Core) are the rules of Bitcoin, and with this understanding, I participate in such-and-such ways..."
Understanding this, a cogent case can be made that [hard forks introduce the *possibility* of violating the NAP principle]( and soft forks do not. It is entirely reasonable to disagree with this specific argument (there are some pretty interesting things you can do with cleverly-done soft forks), but it also seems fair to give this argument due consideration and respect. 
The important thing here is to recognize that the argument is not totally bogus on its face. Whether you personally agree with it or not is not the issue, the issue is that *a reasonably intelligent person would be justified in believing this argument and the conclusions thereof*. It is therefore important to treat hard-fork-hostile opinions with genuine respect; you might not ultimately end up agreeing with such a perspective yourself, but you should do your best to understand the argument(s) of someone who is *not* okay with replacing the existing social contract with a new one (*even* if you think the new one is superior and/or "not really that big of a deal").
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:07:44
Maybe try reading more than just the first line? 
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:53:45
 
For the reasons listed so far, it is clear that there is at least *some* basis upon which a hard fork blocksize increase could be considered "controversial"; once again, you might personally still be in favor of one, but you have to admit that someone who does *not* necessarily think that a blocksize increase would be a good thing, might have actual legitimate reasons for believing so.
Can you go through a list of the top 30 Core developers, and explain their precise opinions on the subject of a blocksize increase and what specific concerns they have with the various proposals that have been made? I would be willing to bet that you cannot (honestly, I doubt that I could either!). Unless you can thoroughly explain each individual developer's arguments for/against each blocksize proposal made thus far, it would be unfair to dismiss the objections prematurely. If you *are* able to list out all the various viewpoints for each developer, I would be very interested to read it over. If you were able to construct a convincing case that the majority of Core developers do *not* actually oppose a particular blocksize increase proposal, and yet one still got NACK'd somewhere along the way, I would be incredibly intrigued and very possibly convinced that I have been wrong this whole time.
In general, though, my experience has been that public-and-prominent "low hanging fruit" developers like Gregory Maxwell and Luke-Jr are most often dismissed and ridiculed through strawman arguments and misrepresentations while the (equally concerned) other Core developers who have voiced objections on the subject are completely ignored. Ultimately, the real point here is this, though: **a hard fork blocksize increase proposal is reasonably contentious at this time**, and it is worth serious thought and consideration before any ecosystem-wide commitments are made.

You must have forgotten to read the thread you're replying to... unless you're simultaneously arguing that 35% of miners are signalling SegWit, too. 
You may want to Google the word "variance".
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:18:45


The word "corresponding" is an important qualifier in that sentence. It implies that these UTXOs already have script predicates requiring ECDSA signatures in a certain way. 
*Those* coins being moved (i.e. coins which *should* require signatures) without proper predicate satisfaction would "not be Bitcoin". Someone making a transaction without a signature needed in the predicate is still Bitcoin, because there is no corresponding private key.


In the context of this thread, I am referring to the second.


The algorithm itself (double SHA 256) can be modified without fundamentally subverting the Nakamoto Consensus model. But introducing and interweaving other consensus mechanisms (like with poison blocks, federation votes (dynamic or otherwise), centralized decree, mandatory out-of-band cooperation, etc) necessarily subverts the Bitcoin consensus construct. At that point, calling it "Bitcoin" is reasonably questionable.

The other side is saying "break Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:15:46
Transactions have "transaction IDs" (AKA txids) which identify them. Right now, I can make a transaction and it will have a certain txid, and then I can reference that transaction with its txid. The problem is, I can also make *the same transaction* and re-sign it and the new (duplicate) transaction will have a different txid from the first one. That would mean it is "malleated", and having malleable transactions like this can cause problems in interesting ways. For instance, stuff like Lightning Network (which is fancy technology that can provide a second "layer" to Bitcoin which allows stuff like millions of transactions per second and instant confirmations) is hard to build and doesn't work well if the transactions involved are malleable.
The only arguments against SegWit are, basically, political arguments (some people don't like/trust the Core developers who came up with and built SegWit). As a technical solution, it is pretty obviously a massive upgrade and there are really no drawbacks to it, but some people are worried that somehow SegWit activating would mean that the Core developers "won" some political battle that they are on the other side of. I don't think this makes a lot of sense, personally. I've also noticed that many people are willing to lie about SegWit (and pretend like it has problems that it doesn't really have), apparently hoping that the truth is too complicated for newcomers to be able to figure things out. This makes it seem more controversial than it really is. I am constantly trying to correct misconceptions where I see them, but there's a lot of misinformation out there at this point.

What does SegWit have to do with the unanimity of Bitcoin experts that BU is a significant (and reckless, and buggy) deviation from the Bitcoin consensus model?
You're changing the subject, and you have the audacity to call *me* the liar.
Also, you dodged the question: **what issue**, numpty? Bitcoin doesn't have any "scaling issues"; it's an O(N²) network (and that means there are tradeoffs and limits to what it can do), but we've known that since the whitepaper debuted. **What issue?**

Ah, the old quote where Satoshi said "hard forks aren't totally *impossible*, you just have to go through extraordinary effort to coordinate them successfully" that people without arguments love to pretend was him saying "this is the best way to scale Bitcoin". It is easily the most commonly misconstrued quote I've *ever* seen in my entire life. Generally, when it's trotted out, it indicates that the person trying to weaponize it isn't able to provide any actual arguments of substance.
Satoshi did not say anything even remotely resembling "We can set up a complicated new signaling method whereby a 51% majority of hashrate can unilaterally dictate the validity parameters and resource requirements of all full nodes" so please don't try to pretend like he did. It's grossly dishonest.

@_date: 2017-02-02 22:32:45


Do not put words in my mouth. My source "agrees with me" 100%. I stated a fact: the only known way that Bitcoin can survive as block rewards meaningfully diminish is with a persistent backlog of transactions available for block inclusion. End of claim. This is a fact, and the source I linked to fully supports this fact.
You (perhaps inadvertently) appear to be midway through an attempt to construct a strawman, where my argument suddenly became "We have to keep the block size limit where it currently is!" That was **not** my claim. I never said that.


Sure, I'll grant you that. It's not "ideal", ideal would be everyone being able to transact 100% frictionlessly and risklessly. But it is the *only* solution that we are aware of, so far. It is literally the only way that Bitcoin *can* work over the long term, as far as anyone can tell. So, for as long as this holds true, you cannot point to a full mempool and say "Look, Bitcoin is experiencing problems!" because a full mempool is actually an indication that *Bitcoin is doing exactly what we would expect, and exactly what it should, in order to continue providing its utility*. It is growing according to its logical trajectory.
If you come up with a magical alternative solution where everyone's problems are solved and the system can survive another way, we'd be happy to hear you out. Judging from your comment here, though, I don't think that's the case.


"The backlog" is a node-by-node mempool. It can certainly remain full without any fundamental problems.


No, it is not. Bitcoin would be working fine. 
Today, you can't spend a 1-satoshi transaction. You can't even spend a 1000-satoshi transaction. Broadcasting a transaction this small will never confirm. Is Bitcoin "broken" because of this? It has been this way for years. Are you saying it has been "broken" since 2011?
Uneconomical transactions not being able to expect confirmation does *not* equal a "broken Bitcoin" and you should be embarrassed that you ever tried to argue that it does. 
Beyond that, there are tools (some of which exist already, some of which are being created now, and some of which no one has even thought of yet) which help with transaction management. CPFP, RBF, accelerator services, etc. You can even, worst case scenario, wait a couple days and then just broadcast a new, more economical, conflicting transaction spending the same inputs. Again, the neglect of uneconomical transaction by the network is *not* a sign of "brokenness" in any way. The whole thing relies on incentive alignment and careful tradeoffs.


In case you haven't noticed, demand for Bitcoin is growing. The general mempool profile of today can provide us useful data for analysis, but yeah, if the block-space supply/demand profile doesn't significantly mature over the next 15 years, we have a big problem on our hands. But notice that you are now (unwittingly) arguing that we should have a *lower* blocksize limit than we currently do.

@_date: 2017-02-03 20:32:55
You're confused, and very possibly the victim of a misinformation campaign. I can help explain how this works.
Basically, if your node asks "Hey, please give me block  then my node will respond "Alright, are you upgraded to support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you). 
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it.
This is how SegWit increases the blocksize while maintaining backwards-compatibility. Pretty clever, huh?
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:38:39
Whoa, now. I don't like this simplification because SegWit still keeps everything (even the witness data / signatures) **on the blockchain**. That data just isn't in the same part of the block that the non-witness-data is.
Saying that SegWit moves the signatures "out of the blockchain" is really misleading, because it makes it sound like it doesn't increase on-chain capacity (which it most certainly does).

This shows a **massive** misunderstanding. In your scenario (where a malicious majority of miners *reverts* SegWit after it has activated, and breaks SegWit rules), the problem is the **reversion** which is a **hard fork**, not the soft fork SegWit itself. And if you are worried about such a reversion, **then any hard fork incurs the exact same risk**!
Think about that for a minute. *Nothing* about SegWit-as-a-softfork makes it any riskier or vulnerable to the above attack than a hard fork SegWit (or any hard fork whatsoever). A majority collusion of miners could revert *any* changes with a hard fork.

Good question. Technically I mean "with current knowledge/capabilities", though in a strong way.
To have dynamic consensus parameters like this would require a perfect oracle, because "demand" and "technological improvements" are extrinsic to the protocol. Without a perfect oracle service (which doesn't exist), making consensus parameters dependent on such elements is introducing an element of trust and arguably undermining the entire point and value proposition of Bitcoin.
It would be possible to make these tradeoffs, of course (and with a perfect oracle you could actually sidestep the tradeoffs entirely), so my statement does need further qualification. Good spot.


I don't think there is such a maximum value. We could, for instance, remove the blocksize limit altogether, and be done with it. This would result in "infinite capacity" so any finite upper bound is thus impossible. But this would also open up all sorts of new problems and attack vectors (some exploitable instantaneously, some exploitable only over a longer-term time horizon, some representing just a subtle but poisonous skewing of incentives towards a less-sustainable model, rather than actual "attack vectors" per se), so once again we're talking about a proposition that could potentially undermine Bitcoin's value proposition and utility in a severe or catastrophic way.
I want to mention something that may seem off-topic, but is actually quite interestingly relevant: Mimblewimble. 
Mimblewimble is [a proposal for a different blockchain architecture]( and is currently being developed as a potential sidechain for Bitcoin, but for our purposes, imagine that Bitcoin itself just forked to do things Mimblewimble-style. The neat thing about Mimblewimble is that it validates transactions without needing the full history of the coins involved, which could have a dramatic impact on "on-chain scalability" because the vast majority of blockchain data is no longer necessary for validation. This would fundamentally alter the relevant tradeoffs when it comes to capacity (almost eliminating some of them); no longer would "much more Bitcoin usage" necessarily result "much higher node operation costs" and so we could (much more safely) derestrict the blocksize limit and not worry nearly as much about resultant centralization pressure.
So, I personally think that this demonstrates something very important: it is possible to achieve giant capacitative increases (even "on-chain") *without* making huge sacrifices when it comes to Bitcoin's security and consensus model. We just need to approach this matter intelligently and thoroughly weigh the pros and cons of all the proposals that are made.

No, that definition is not nearly sufficient.
If it is possible, at all, for people can spend each other's coins without the corresponding private keys, that is **not** and will **never be** Bitcoin. 
With these shitcoin pretenders like BU, such things are possible with a majority collusion of miners. It is not Bitcoin.
Even deeper than that, if Satoshi's solution to the Byzantine General's problem is "un-solved" and replaced with some new consensus mechanism (whether or not that new consensus mechanism includes double-SHA-256 securing the chain), that is not Bitcoin either. 
If someone alters the inflation schedule, granting themselves a million coins in one coinbase transaction, that would not be Bitcoin, even though technically we're still under the 21M limit.
Gavin's attempt at a definition is laughably naive. It is like the rough draft of a definition dreamt up by a high schooler who just heard about Bitcoin. The professor might give them a "B" on the assignment if they were feeling generous, but the student didn't really provide a "right" answer in any meaningful sense.

So now I've talked briefly about ways in which hard forks and blocksize increases can induce risks or warrant concern, in a general sense. So far, we haven't particularly focused on any *specific proposals* and the problems thereof. I'll try to do that now.
First there was BIP101 and BitcoinXT. Gavin proposed a massive blocksize-increasing hard-fork (to 20MB initially, and exponentially growing to multiple-gigabytes from there) via a series of blog posts, rather than via the developer mailing list. When concerns started to be voiced about it, rather than adjusting the proposal according to the feedback and peer-review that he received, Gavin said "Fine, Mike Hearn and I will put this into BitcoinXT and users can run *that* instead!"
Mike Hearn was quite possibly already working at R3 at this time. He was also historically mired in controversy (as a longstanding proponent of blacklists, redlists, and deprecating Tor-support in general, his role in accidentally forking Bitcoin with the v0.8 update, not to mention his consistently outspoken and aggressive attitude in exchanges with other developers over the years). He openly admitted that governance of the BitcoinXT project would be him having the "final say" on *all matters*.
There were numerous objections to the specifics of BIP101, which were ultimately validated when it was demonstrated that [allowing blocks of that magnitude in size would be fundamentally unsustainable and network-breaking in a number of ways]( But even setting that aside, the problem here was that the peer review and criticism of Gavin's proposal *were completely sidestepped and ignored*, and Gavin and Mike doubled-down on their efforts to publicize and drum up populist support for the proposal anyway. No efforts were made in the bitcoin-dev mailing list (nor via IRC, nor reddit, nor even via any private communications channels that I'm aware of) to reconcile with opposing perspectives. No concessions were made. It was outright, utter dismissal.
From the perspective of *every developer working on Bitcoin at the time* (other than Gavin and Mike), BitcoinXT was a massive "fuck you" and a massively immature ragequit of the project that everyone was collaborating on. It was an attempt to hijack full control of the reference implementation from the community of developers who had, through grassroots participation and collaboration, maintained Bitcoin and improved it over the years. 
I ask you to set aside any bias you have against Bitcoin Core, and try your very best to empathize with how it must have felt from the perspective of all those developers when Gavin and Mike said "Ok, if you guys don't like this change, then you guys are 'fired' and we are taking control!" It was a political coup, the likes of which had never been attempted before. Their specific concerns and reasoning were completely bypassed and ignored. Even when some of them tried to reach out and find some sort of mutual understanding and common ground, Gavin and Mike said "The time for that is past, you guys had your chance" and never attended any of the mailing list discussions, conferences, or meetups in which attempts at compromise or agreement were made.

What I am saying is that **you cannot receive a 0-conf transaction before it is confirmed in a block right now.**

@_date: 2017-02-14 15:58:02
What do you mean by "fix the backlog"? A persistent backlog is *necessary* for Bitcoin to survive the next decade or two. It's not a problem that needs to be fixed, it's a symptom of healthy growth.
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:35:46
Yeah, that's right. In general, miners (or mining pools) are regularly upgrading their software to incorporate updates and improvements over time. 
The majority of these improvements don't involve rules that change *consensus* and only affect the node being upgraded. Others (like SegWit) *do* affect consensus. In other words, if you tried to make a SegWit transaction but the rest of the network didn't recognize it yet, your transaction would not be "valid" according to the miners, and wouldn't get included in a block. 
Because of this, one upgrade (BIP9) has been created to allow miners to "signal" to each other what consensus upgrades they are supporting. Basically, BIP9 lets you see how much of the network has upgraded already. Using this as a safety mechanism, SegWit will only activate when 95% of miners have signaled that they support it. This way, by the time you can make a SegWit transaction, it's completely safe to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:14:04

After the doomsday rhetoric of "with full blocks, Bitcoin will enter a negative feedback loop and die" was disproved by a series of stress-tests on mainnet, and the magnitude of Gavin's proposed size increase was shown to be ridiculously untenable by academics in the space, and perhaps significantly due to the controversial moderation policies of theymos and his team of moderators in this subreddit, the XT movement ultimately failed.
Out of the ashes rose Bitcoin Classic. The reasoning behind it being "Okay, even though XT was a bad idea, we can dial it down to a *minimum viable fork* of a mere *doubling* of blocksize, and couple it with a new (not very Sybil-resistant) web-based upvote governance model that will replace the historical peer-review (meritocracy-based) model." 
Once again, no effort was made to address the concerns voiced by the Core developers; the focus was on "firing them" and "replacing them" with a new community. The actual developer/engineering experience of this new community was never particularly emphasized; after all, the only real change was (basically) to update a "1" to a "2" in the source code of consensus.h and recompile. Sure, there was a *bit* more to it than that (and yeah, sure, it ultimately had roughly the same amount of lines-of-code changed that SegWit did, but with *significantly* less test-coverage [which makes up the bulk of the changes with SegWit]), but that was the general premise, and that seemed good enough. After all, once the network forked, the Core developers would continue building on Bitcoin, even though now the repository had a "Classic" tacked on to the end of it. No big deal!
But many Core developers said, "What? No. I don't agree with changing the 1 to a 2... and if Classic is going to ignore my input on important matters like this, and completely dismiss the NACKs that I provide, I wouldn't necessarily keep contributing to the project at that point." Classic's integral assumption (that the community of Core developers who had voiced opposition to the change they were proposing, would be completely A-OK with jumping on board with the project after the change was made and the coup successful) was suddenly shown not to be valid.
Then it came out that Classic had basically lied about a bunch of industry names that "supported" them, and were deceptive in general with the proposal. After one of the Toomim brothers tripped acid and talked shit on the Core slack channel, there was a PR fallout, and Classic lost a fair bit of steam. Then thousands of McNodes turned off almost overnight, as Amazon Free Trials expired, and it was exposed that the bulk of Classic's node support had been completely faked.
Then when SegWit was proposed, which was expected to deliver roughly the same capacity benefits that Classic would have (but with significantly less security risks and significantly more [long-term benefits]( all the wind was stolen from Classic's sails, and it quietly faded from favor.

You are absolutely right. Also, important note: the "nolnet" is not a public testnet. In fact, I can find no information regarding how to connect to this "nolnet", nor any mentions of it *anywhere* prior to the BU accidental-fork-attempt post-mortem.
It appears that "nolnet", if it exists at all, is a local network privately run by one or more BU devs for internal testing purposes, possibly ephemerally. Calling it a "testnet" (again, if it even exists), is a bit disingenuous.

Well "need" has a specific definition. Just take care not to use it incorrectly, and annoying pedants like me won't pester you about it :)
Anyway, I'm of the opinion that the only thing Bitcoin would really need to get "Average Joe" interested enough to start getting involved is one more instance of a dramatically-rising price. A couple of news headlines about it, and bam, Bubble Frenzy all over again.
I recognize that a natural objection to this is: "Isn't that a chicken-and-egg problem? If it takes a rising price to entice Average Joes to buy Bitcoin, and the price rises when Average Joes buy, why would it ever rise in the first place?"
But, no, it doesn't *need* Average Joes for the price to rise. That would accelerate and intensify any price rise, of course, but it could get started any number of ways. Bored billionaires could do it, gradually-escalating Wall Street demand could do it, an economic crisis in some random country that causes capital flight could do it, and a thousand other scenarios that I can't even begin to predict could do it. 
That's part of what makes this so exciting for me. But there is absolutely no reason the next bullstorm needs to start with the wallets of Average Joe and Jane.

What constitutes "high enough" when it comes to these things? Is 95% a high enough threshold? Ideally, we'd have a *higher* threshold than that, right?
We can see hundreds of nodes that haven't upgraded in *years*. Are you saying you're totally fine with putting all of the users of such nodes in financial risk?
Personally, I do *not* think that the case is as open-and-shut as that. I think we have a moral duty to do what we can to *prevent* innocent users from being in any more risk than they have to be. Are you suggesting that my stance here is totally invalid, and deserves complete dismissal?

Just stop. You're embarrassing yourself very badly.
SegWit is an upgrade to improve scaling and capacity. That is *all* it is. Every benefit of SegWit is capacity-related. 
First you tried to pretend like SegWit isn't about capacity at all. I corrected you by pointing out that it is *all* about capacity.
You then asked "what about malleability, that's not capacity related" and I responded explaining that **yes, it is**. Now you've backpedaled: "it was just rhetorical! Also LN isn't a panacea!" as if that isn't an abrupt and obvious attempt to change the subject.

It's a pet peeve of mine, as well, since it sort of implies that some math whiz could come through and figure out a new approach that makes the problem a lot easier and makes them some sort of superminer.

How is it overcomplicated? It actually requires *much* less code than a safe hardfork blocksize increase would require.
In a nutshell, SegWit is a blocksize increase where only *witness data* can occupy the new space in the blocks. That's it.
The benefits of this sort of blocksize increase is **massively reduced complexity**, because not only is it possible as a soft fork (and backwards compatible), which means that safeguards like replay protections aren't necessary to implement, but also the many new risks and attack vectors that a "standard" blocksize increase would create (like quadratic sigops attacks and UTXO bloat externalities) are not dangers. In other words, SegWit is much simpler than a hard fork blocksize increase, code-wise, because we don't have to write a bunch of complicated new accommodations and restrictions and limits to contend with the new dangers that larger blocks would present. SegWit prevents all these dangers with one simple, clean update.

The approach you describe is incredibly simplified, almost to the point of absurdity.
First, think about the logistics of deploying hashpower... You can't just take $x and wave a wand and convert it into ASICs on the spot. You would need fab factories and a few months to manufacture. During that time other factories are adding to hashpower...
Then let's assume it is successfully deployed. It's definitely possible for anyone in the community to blacklist particular miners or nodes. Even if the Big Bad Government Blockchain was technically longer than the alternative chain, we'd be fine just ignoring it and continuing along as if it didn't exist. It'd certainly be an interesting occurrence, but definitely not fatal. Not even close.
And then we'd point and laugh as that government tried to justify their wasted expenditures to their population.
If you are a government and you want to attack Bitcoin, you wouldn't do it with a naive 51% attack like that.
There are better attack vectors, if that's all you want. The most likely one is legislation. Then there's coercion of existing mining conglomerates, and open-market maneuvers such as steady and personally-unprofitable sell-pressure (paid for out-of-pocket). You could launch or "sponsor" some altcoin that you felt more capable of cornering the supply for. There are a million possibilities, and by far the silliest would be "Let's just start buying and building miners for a 51% attack!"

I don't know what that is supposed to mean, and would appreciate if we could keep the shitslinging and ad hominems to a minimum.


Yes, indeed. And that is worrying, because the entire point of Bitcoin is to enable an e-cash that doesn't rely on *trust*, which *everyone not running their own node is technically relying on*.


Possibly, yes. We can't definitively say that it is *not* a bad thing, at least.


This isn't a valid assumption to make. Both sides are equally capable of claiming that their solution would "greatly increase the total number of users", and neither is more correct than the other.
Your point about open source software and the element of trust involved is an *excellent* point. You're definitely right, and this is most certainly a point worth making and understanding. I appreciate it.
I *do* want to take a moment to highlight the uniqueness of the Bitcoin network, though, in that it is a target for attack/suppression by many large entrenched interests. Typical open source software isn't usually playing for the same "stakes" as Bitcoin is.
But again, great point. I need to think more on it.

It does not solve that problem because you specifically specified "without the use of a third party" - if you're using this hypothetical bitDollar, then the third party is whoever is maintaining the payment network (most likely the Fed).
The component which allows Bitcoin to enable the transfer of value without a third party mediating it is the blockchain. In this hypothetical scenario, there is no blockchain, meaning you're relying on a third party to approve and relay your transactions for you.

You don't get *any* of the benefits of a cryptocurrency if you centralize it like you describe. The only benefits Bitcoin provides are those concerning decentralization and the resultant immutability of the protocol. There are no benefits to a blockchain beyond those and their consequences. 
This is what you, and so many like you, have yet to realize. You seem to assume that via some magic property, the blockchain is a more efficient value-transfer mechanism than a centralized alternative. This is not so. 
Decentralization is the sole advantage of using a blockchain. The clever bit was making the token supply ultimately finite, thereby creating an incentive to participate in the blockchain-based system versus the centralized inflationary alternatives. Ceteris paribus, no rational agent should choose to keep their wealth in an inflationary asset versus a deflationary one, so there is a natural gravity to the blockchain.
Basically, you're saying "Hey what if a government started a cryptocoin and backed it with their coffers and political might..." which fails to take into account that this would in no way help that government.

I'd be interested to see your calculations on those odds.
While past performance obviously doesn't guarantee future performance results, it can certainly be used to inform your perspective on a subject. As it stands, Bitcoin has appreciated in value multiple times, in a bubble cycle. An argument can be made that this appreciation was a result of fraudulent activity in a largely-monopolized nascent market, but I would say a stronger argument can be made that a guaranteedly-scarce new monetary token has reflected user-adoption in its exchange rate as its young network grows.
If I'm right about why Bitcoin's value has increased so much, then there would need to be a fundamental change for the pattern to suddenly stop occurring. In other words, the adoption rate would need to have saturated all potential markets that it will ultimately penetrate, or the network (not a subset of it) would have to meaningfully fail in some way. Neither of these have occurred, so it makes sense that the appreciation should continue (and logically should do so exponentially by the nature of network expansion).
The price being "high" shouldn't stop the price from increasing further, as long as the same phenomena that incurred price growth continue to exist or occur.
In other words, just guessing that Bitcoin's bubble cycle will suddenly stop occurring is not very smart, unless you back up that guess with thorough logic.

@_date: 2017-02-28 01:10:38
Until now, my points have all concentrated on *hard forks in general*, rather than *blocksize-increasing hard forks*, which present additional concerns (which I am about to attempt to expound upon), and *specific blocksize-increasing proposals that have been made to date*, which each present even more concerns (which I will be getting to later).
Note: Bitcoin's raison d'être is to minimize and replace the costs of *trust* via cryptographic proofs and decentralized
There are fundamental trade-offs between
scale and decentralization. If it is too expensive to independently enforce the system's rules, people and businesses will be
forced to trust third parties in meaningful ways. As someone smarter than I once put it: if the Bitcoin blockchain’s resource usage, relative to the available technology, is too great, Bitcoin loses its competitive advantages compared to legacy systems because validation will be too costly (pricing out many users), forcing trust back into the system. If capacity is too low and our methods of transacting too inefficient, access to the chain for dispute resolution will be too costly, again pushing trust back into the system.
Therefore *any* proposal which seeks to make a change which increases the costs of validation (even marginally) deserves scrutiny and skepticism. A lifting of the 1MB maximum blocksize limit, by definition, does so. Any proposal which increases the 1MB limit, including SegWit, has, *at minimum*, one valid point against it: it will increase the cost of independent chain-validation.
Couple this with the fact that the total full-node count has been dwindling steadily for many years now (even as Bitcoin grows massively in adoption and usage), which may indicate that costs are *already* too expensive for most users, and you have a worrying concern.
I will grant that HDD storage costs will not be ballooning to particularly cost-prohibitive figures under small-factor linear-increases in the blocksize in the short- or medium-term future. But bandwidth costs/capabilities and memory costs are bigger concerns, and *can* conceivably move rapidly away from the "affordable by consumers and small businesses" category. If this happens, it *could* hypothetically induce systemic risk, providing "choke points" that antagonistic governments or institutions could target to cripple or destroy the network's utility. 
This is not to say that the doomsday scenario alluded to above is an inevitability if we increase the blocksize moderately. It is solely meant to demonstrate the principle of the argument; if node-operation costs rise too rapidly (and/or if they are coupled with other interesting circumstances that exacerbate particular phenomena), we could conceivably wind up with a castrated and/or useless Bitcoin. A centralized Bitcoin is no better than Liberty Reserve or e-gold, and rising node costs *can* theoretically exert centralization pressure.

No, I didn't claim anything like what you're saying. This is known as a "strawman argument".


Yes, note that I didn't say "there exist thousands of *possible* hard forks", I said there exist thousands of such hard forks. Which is exactly accurate. Again, you appear to be arguing against something I didn't say.




Interesting assumption there. This is why I suggested you should take a deep breath. It is obvious that you're extremely upset here, and trying to "lash out" as it were. You happen to be embarrassing yourself rather badly in the process.


Yes, really.


Yes, I know. I am well aware. 
If a child is throwing a temper tantrum, and you say "You need to calm down" to them, and they respond by shouting "*YOU* NEED TO CALM DOWN!" back at you, it is a sign that the child is upset. Even though they just repeated the same words that you said back at you, it doesn't mean that those words make sense when *they* say them. Within context, it is obvious that the child is not in a balanced frame of mind and that they need some time to cool off and get a grip. This wouldn't indicate that you were similarly upset (again, even though technically you said the same series of words that the frantic child did).
You see, repeating someone's suggestions back at them doesn't always make sense.

Now you've regressed back to square zero, with an appeal-to-authority that amounts to "SegWit is about fixing malleability!" as if we haven't been over the fact that the whole appeal of fixing malleability is for the capacity gains of doing so.

As such, it is understood among Bitcoin engineers that a hard-fork implementation should have code written to protect against replay attacks and other forms of defraudation at the expense of un-upgraded, forward-incompatible nodes. There are a wide variety of such attacks, and so a sane hard-fork proposal must necessarily include protectionary mechanisms against such behavior. These sorts of mechanisms would warrant significant expert peer-review and test coverage... to summarize, a lot of developer-hours would be needed to suitably address such vulnerabilities. Adequate solutions to problems like this take *time* and *effort* to create and vet.
For whatever it is worth: UnlimitedCoin does not actually have any serious replay protection mechanisms or protectionary code. In large part, the Unlimited approach is to leave vulnerabilities as vulnerabilities.
Scaling Bitcoin and increasing its transaction capacity has been presented as a pressing concern that we need to address as quickly as possible. Granting this, it would make sense to concentrate on implementing a solution which does not require such protection mechanisms, if at all possible, to minimize time-to-delivery and room-for-error. In other words, if *speed of deployment* is a serious concern and safety is being taken at all seriously, soft-forks have a distinct advantage over hard-forks.
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:32:49
No, you don't understand. The queue is literally [necessary]( for Bitcoin to survive over the medium or long term.
A fee market (where non-competitive transactions do not confirm) is not a problem in any sense.
In fact, it has been this way for years. You can't make a 1-satoshi transaction and expect confirmation because that sort of transaction is uneconomical to process. Even a 100-satoshi transaction with a 99-satoshi fee won't be confirmed. That doesn't indicate a problem with the network. That is perfectly fine and normal. And it has been this way since 2011.

There is a real risk of social/image/PR problems, in the event of a coin-split (which a hard fork might very well create). Two coins would both be competing over the name of "Bitcoin" and regardless of which one ultimately won (if either did), there would be potentially-enormous social cost of such a fracture. Right now, there might be a rift in the community, but at least there is only one "Bitcoin" and the world is able to recognize this fact.
A split Bitcoin could very possibly scare off potential investors; one of the predominant concerns with Bitcoin as a store-of-wealth is that "it's digital", which induces worries of copy-and-paste "hacks" and other such issues that can't arise with traditional commodities like gold and silver. From a naive external perspective, Bitcoin splitting in half would perhaps seem to validate the subconscious concerns of *mutability* of all things digital. It's very difficult to explain to someone why Bitcoin is immutable when everything else on a computer seemingly isn't... if it forked in half and we had to explain to such people that "Okay, there are actually two versions of Bitcoin, one where *A* and the other where *B*..." then we would be at an even worse disadvantage than we are already. The uphill battle would just get more steep.
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:24:46
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:56:46
I mean the incident from a few days ago where BU 1.0 mined a block 1.032MB in size, because the developers can't do basic arithmetic, don't understand the codebase that they are haphazardly changing, and don't do any serious testing on the changes they do make.
Oh, and also the time from a few months ago when they forked the "big blocks testnet" by falsely signalling BIP109 support, and then had to shut down the testnet as a result (and have not run a public testnet since).
I review code firsthand. You're not going to be able to convince me that "this sub is twisting the truth!" or anything like that, because I'm verifying these things directly. Sorry, kid, but your frantic spin attempts and propaganda have no power over me; I read and write code.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:23:09
Yeah, I actually agree with you completely on that. I also apologize if I've been unnecessarily hostile here, I take a very adversarial stance on these debates these days and sometimes go overboard. Sorry.
Let me ask you this: what would you ask, and of whom, in terms of "honoring the spirit of the Hong Kong Agreement"? Do you have a specific proposal in mind, and has it been documented in a BIP or otherwise? Have you aired any proposals on the developer mailing lists, trying to seek peer review on them? If not, are you aware of any proposals that *have* undergone such a process which you particularly support and would like to see worked on or implemented as top priority? Also, do you intend to help in the coding or peer review process at all? Alternatively, have you found any Core developers who have similar concerns and priorities to your own, in particular with regards to scaling? Finally, are you well aware of *all* of the specific concerns of the other prominent protocol developers in this space (and yes, that includes employees of Blockstream just as much as it includes everyone else) and what steps have you (or your favored proposal/proposer) taken to address these concerns and reach a solution of mutual agreement? 
Please, please take a moment here and ask yourself these questions in earnest. Please resist the temptation to dismiss them prematurely, and actually take a moment to ask yourself the questions, and give your best and most honest answers to them. 
There is another point here that I'm also trying to get at, beyond just inviting you to do some impartial introspection, and that is this: "Core" is not an organization like most organizations you are used to.
No one can "speak on behalf of Core"; it's not like that. People who like to work on and build Bitcoin just do so, and when other such people review their code and agree that it is safe and solid, they merge the changes in. If there isn't agreement, it doesn't get merged in. It's basically a peer-review gateway, as it should be, and over the years, everyone who was genuinely concerned with and capable of contributing to Bitcoin started doing so, *into Core*... 
So the group has emerged over time, and is still growing. No one "leads" it, they all just peer review each other's stuff and always err on the side of caution, i.e. never merging in changes that have significant opposition. It's not an evil cabal, it's actually very open and collaborative... I promise you, if you want to become a part of Bitcoin Core, you can. Just helping with testing would be huge and massively appreciated. And you would be amazed at what you learn and what you can achieve just by hanging around the IRC or participating (politely and conservatively) on the mailing lists. It's an open discussion, and legit debate is commonplace. 
Luke-Jr is a long-time Bitcoin developer who has a long track record of solid contributions to the Bitcoin codebase and thoughtspace as well as a long list of "times he was proven exactly right in hindsight", and he has been consistently opposed to even the *soft-cap* lifts in the blocksize that have occurred. Yes, a lot of his arguments are radical, but on what specific grounds can you say he is wrong about this? Node count *has* dropped over time, as predicted. His hard fork proposal is *of course* going to respect his own concerns on this subject; why wouldn't it? I haven't seen solid rebuttals of his concerns in this department, just instant dismissals by close-minded individuals and thorough consideration of his perspective by more open-minded individuals. So if you think you can make a better blocksize increase BIP than Luke-Jr, one that better takes into account the concerns of the developer community and community at large, *you* can do so. Not kidding at all, and it's something to think about!

[Here is the definitive answer.](
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:08:53
Oh, I could give such a list, it would include at least 5 or 6 prominent developers...
But you're missing the point, which is: we are all criticizing (and laughing at) the fact that rbtc is so "anti-Core" and spews hate speech directed at **Core itself**, which doesn't make sense and shows how confused (yet venomous) the subreddit is.
So when you come around asking for us to provide quotes where they attack specific developers, it shows that you're missing the point, because we are criticizing their "blanket attacks" to begin with. 
Now, if you really want me to, I can go dig up a dozen references of hate speech from rbtc referring to specific individual developers rather than Core as a whole, just to prove a point, but you need to understand that this is a new subject entirely, because we were talking about rbtc's naive holism when it comes to Bitcoin Core (and Blockstream).

Now you're just lying. You can signal acceptance of larger blocks via SegWit. This has been in Core since v0.13.1.

Point number 2 is not actually a reference to the blocksize cap at all. It is a philosophical premise on the distinction between hard forks and soft forks. Did you read the article which I linked to? It should (hopefully) do a good job of explaining this further.
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:51:05
SegWit *does* come with a blocksize increase, to 4MB, in fact. So it's actually larger than a 2MB blocksize increase.
And yes, it is a real blocksize increase. It doesn't require a hard-fork, but why would we want it to, when we can increase the blocksize without one?
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:54:36


Consensus parameters and wallet choice are entirely orthogonal. You can tell yourself that I'm confused as much as you want, but it's just going to prevent you from learning.


Again, it doesn't matter *how* you sign your transactions, and it doesn't matter whether you're using SegWit or not. A hard fork can "give away your coins" either way. 
**You are missing the point.**


There exist thousands of such "hard forks". They're called altcoins.


Oh, it makes perfect sense. You're very confused on a fundamental level. That's what I'm trying to help with.
You appear very agitated and upset at this point, though. Perhaps it's time to stand up, stretch your legs, take a few deep breaths, and maybe step outside for a minute? It's much harder to learn when you're in an imbalanced frame of mind.

Ah, but now you're changing the topic of discussion. We weren't talking about whether Bitcoin has a higher percentage of thefts than alternatives, nor whether it is insured.
I was simply saying that holding Bitcoin is one way of using it. You argued that it cannot be considered a "use" for Bitcoin on the grounds that Bitcoin cannot be considered wealth, and you based this on the presumption that it is impossible to securely convert Bitcoin into other desirable assets (goods/services/etc). I pointed out that to apply this logic consistently rules out *anything* being classified as a form of wealth, employing *reductio ad absurdum* to demonstrate the fallacy of your argument.
At this stage, you're trying to redirect the discussion, but I'm not particularly interested in talking about the current lack of federally-guaranteed insurance available for Bitcoin nor the theft rate in the ecosystem, which I think we're both well aware of. 
It was a nice talk, but it looks like we may have reached a conclusion of sorts. And lest it be forgotten, my initial assertions (holding Bitcoin is using Bitcoin, and wealth can be stored in Bitcoin) remain unrefuted and true.

We need a persistent transaction backlog if we are going to survive the transition (over the next ten years or so) away from a block subsidy. We have to get used to full blocks because they are a necessary ingredient for a successful Bitcoin.
I know that some people think "It's too early to worry about that" and paint the full-blocks-today scenario as a bad thing... but I have never heard one of these people propose a suitable timeline on how they would prefer for a subsidy --&gt; fee transition to occur. Considering that over 3/4 (75%) of all bitcoins have already been mined, I think we need to start having these discussions now. We have to be ready to accept that full blocks are a necessity, one way or another, and get used to the implications of this fact. Better sooner than later, I'd think.

No, it's for regulatory compliance reasons. The gift card industry is notorious for being under-the-table and they're trying to cover their bases.

That's fair. I never said otherwise, though while I'm here I will say that with a healthy helping of prudence and IT know-how you can mitigate most of the risks. Of course, it is significantly more difficult to do so with Bitcoin than with other instruments of wealth, and debatable whether this will ever be "fixed" or improved significantly enough to make Bitcoin a viable option for most people.
As long as you acknowledge that holding Bitcoin is a legitimate usage of Bitcoin, then we don't disagree and there is no argument.

Because fiat withdrawals from Gox were impossible. This prevented arbitrage from occurring which would have equalized Gox's prices with the other exchanges. The premium on coins there was what is known as a "risk premium" - basically, the higher price reflected an inherent risk that you would never be able to cash out your Bitcoin (the risk that Mt. Gox went bankrupt).
Obviously, we can see in retrospect that this is exactly what happened. 
Had Gox withdrawals been flowing smoothly on the fiat-side, its price would not have been higher than other exchanges' prices because traders would have arbitraged this opportunity until it no longer existed.
TL;DR: the higher prices were not reflective of Gox "leading" the market - they reflected a risk premium.
If Gox were leading the market, we would have seen it move (both up and down) *before* such movements occurred on other exchanges. Instead, it followed BTCChina's lead, but adjusted to a 5-10% premium in price.

If that is really the route you want to take, then there is no such thing as wealth. Any form of wealth can hypothetically be robbed from you during expenditure/conversion in some way. Bitcoin is by no means unique in this regard, and is arguably orders of magnitude **more** secure and resistant to such pitfalls when handled intelligently and responsibly.
Speaking empirically, I've made dozens of Bitcoin transactions and transfers without any problems whatsoever.
You're basically stretching the limits of fantasy to support a ridiculous narrative. I suspect you're fully aware of this, too, to be perfectly honest. You seem intelligent to me, so I find it hard to believe your argument here even convinces yourself.

I guess I would be impressed of *any* such proof of a hypothetical and unbounded negative, but that's besides the point.
I have no need to know the specifics of your model, since by definition it is necessarily a model which contradicts the one expounded above (namely, that the cost or burden of operating a node will have a negative impact on the quantity of nodes run), otherwise you wouldn't be trying to argue the point. So yeah, you can pretend away the *a priori* argument if you want, you can even pretend away the *a posteriori* argument while you're at it, but let's not kid ourselves, that's exactly what you're doing: pretending.
And the worst part is, you probably don't even run a full node.

Ok, I hear where you're coming from, and totally understand you. I have a favor to ask of you: *please* do your best to take the rest of my comment seriously, and not dismiss the perspective immediately. It is probably not going to be easy to do this, but I just want to ask you to sincerely try.
What if a large portion of the community *doesn't want the blocksize to be increased at all*? Many very smart, very knowledgeable, and very pro-Bitcoin people believe that the current blocksize limit is **too large**, and that if anything, it should be reduced. Furthermore, the majority of the miners are currently supporting "keep the blocksize at the status quo of 1MB" despite there being numerous different software offerings that would increase the limit in different ways.
If you are interested, I'd be happy to elaborate a little bit on *why* this is a valid perspective, and what sort of arguments such people make to support their view. But it's besides the point that I want to make here, which is this:
**Do you think we should ignore these people?** You said "I want a solutions that makes everybody or at least the whole community happy," and the only way to make these people happy would be to *decrease* the limit rather than *increase* it. It seems like you're saying we should not treat these people's opinions with respect, and that we should just ignore their arguments and increase the blocksize anyway. But does that seem fair? Why are they not part of "the community" that you want to make happy? Or are they?
It seems like the only responses I ever see to these concerns, arguments, and people is: "Well I disagree so we should ignore your opinion and do things my way instead" which is not a good argument nor an intelligent way to do things. 
So, once again, I want to ask you: do you just want to dismiss the people who have different opinions on the subject than you do (even if they hypothetically make up the majority of the community)? If not, then you are admitting that we should perhaps keep the blocksize limit in place, at least until we are able to find a solution that everybody (including the so-called "small-blockers") happy. After all, even if you personally wish that Bitcoin had a larger limit, that's just one opinion.

Userbase has expanded over a hundredfold (perhaps even a thousandfold) in the past 4 years.
Node count has *dropped* in that time. And that's *with* the 1MB limit. And was predicted ahead of time by some of the smart engineers in Core as the soft caps were repeatedly raised against their objections.
So, yeah, not only are you wrong *a priori*, but you're wrong *a posteriori*, too. We have empirical evidence refuting your naive claims as hard as it can.

I do wish the dialogue's focus was more technical (or even philosophical or economic) but unfortunately most people don't want to bog down into such depths. 
Price is exciting and simple to grasp. It is a polarizing subject. It causes (normal people's) heads to turn.
At this point, the Bitcoin community is big enough to suffer from the pitfalls of all big communities: short digestible memes and soundbites fare a lot better than thorough, well-thought-out but ultimately nuanced and complex dissertations and analyses. Perhaps that's a sign of it poking into the mainstream. Perhaps it will prove to be Bitcoin's biggest weakness. Regardless, it's the reality of the situation, but it's important to understand that the phenomenon is by no means endemic to cryptocurrency. It's just human nature on a macroscopic level.

I'm not assuming anything. I just read you say that two incompatible Internet protocols is desirable over one. That incontrovertibly demonstrates your lack of understanding of what function protocols perform.
I wasn't talking about blockchains, though if you want, after we've finished the discussion we *are* having, I'll be glad to go over that with you.
You said having two fundamentally incompatible Internet protocols would be better than having one standard protocol whereby universal communication is made possible. In other words, you argue that a fractured and divided Internet, where data and content on one half of the network is inaccessible to users of the other half, is a better option than what we have now. You do not seem aware of the fact that this is your argument (yet), but if we can manage to stay on topic hopefully you'll see why it is. This is the subject of discussion, and you have made the claim. The onus is currently on you to defend it, if you wish to do so.

That's not an accurate description of what happened, though. Multiple alternative proposals were made and evaluated, and ultimately developer consensus in Core was achieved for SegWit.
In other words, what you describe as "what should have happened" *is* what actually happened. Many developers assessed the initial few proposals (including Gavin's, Adam's, and Jeff's), voiced various concerns and shortcomings of each, and worked together to come up with a solution that everyone was happy with and that gained serious support after going through critical peer review.
I can completely understand if you want to argue that SegWit isn't a perfect solution, but it is totally untrue to claim that the Core developers who peer reviewed the first few proposals were being "obstructive hecklers" who didn't offer any alternative proposals.

I hear and respect what you're saying, but I never said Bitcoin would "replace" the other systems. Email didn't replace snail mail, for instance.
The analogy still holds because email was a distributed protocol established for universal use and access that handles the use-case of information communication across the Internet. Bitcoin is a distributed protocol established for universal use and access that handles the use-case of value transmission across the Internet. 
Sure, other methods exist. And other methods will of course continue to be used. But the blockchain is the most elegant backbone for a universally-accessible protocol of money, in my opinion.
Your points still stand (and excellent points they are). I'm not saying SWIFT is grossly inefficient and to be honest I know only a cursory amount about the behind-the-scenes mechanisms thereof. But Bitcoin is open. It's hard to quantify how valuable or useful that may be, but I suspect it will be somewhat revolutionary.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:42:09

No, SegWit introduces nothing that isn't already in Bitcoin already in that regard.
You could always include a super-easy-to-satisfy script predicate in a transaction you broadcast (or mine yourself). So SegWit isn't altering consensus here. It is a *tightening* of the rules of consensus. You seem confused (perhaps you thought it was a rule relaxation of some kind).


You are mistaking this: 
...for this: 
Hope that helps.


In a way, though maybe not the way you might interpret an affirmative answer to represent.
Satoshi introduced a datastructure that can be appended to only through computational expenditure and a precise accordance to a set of validity requirements that are effectively "sticky" due to a careful arrangement of incentives to protect and preserve the value of the system. That is not to say such rules cannot evolve, but the entire solution does (as you've astutely observed) depend on resistance to coercion (be it actuated through collusion or otherwise). In other words, Satoshi's solution doesn't *just* involve the computational resource expenditure, but also the pre-agreed protocol specifications by which the Generals communicate, and even more than that, solving the Byzantine Generals problem was *still* only part of Satoshi's insight! The other component is the self-perpetuating economic construct which, in case it wasn't obvious, is tightly coupled with the Byzantine solution in the case of Bitcoin.

Quick-and-dirty rebuttal: hypothetically, ten billionaires (Bill Gates, the Walton family, Warren Buffet, Oprah, a couple others) decide to buy Bitcoin en masse. Any and all asks are immediately filled, and inevitably rationally withdrawn as demand seems insatiable. Price skyrockets to $100,000 per coin easily.
Average Joe never got involved in my hypothetical. So to say "we need average joe for price like that" is demonstrably untrue. 
Now *don't* freak out and tell me how unlikely my hypothetical is. It's not supposed to be likely; it just needs to be possible. And it is. And it proves that you're wrong.

Firstly, take a few minutes to ponder scarcity and its effect on value. 
Secondly, you're absolutely wrong that having 2 incompatible Internet protocols would be preferable to having one Internet. It is fine to have networks that are "independent" in that they are not directly communicating with one another; these are called intranets or LANs and they serve a purpose and are good. It is *not* good to have another redundant protocol which is fundamentally incompatible with the primary protocol, rendering these networks incapable of exchanging information between one another (even if local network operators wanted the information exchange to be possible).
You don't seem to understand scarcity nor protocols in general. Perhaps you should read and think a bit more, and then revisit the topic at a later date.

The most compelling reason for a merchant to accept Bitcoin is that Coinbase or Bitpay will undercut competitors' payment processing fees.
The most compelling reason for a consumer to start using Bitcoin (outside of DNMs) is the potential to profit as it rises in value.
Feel free to spend your bitcoins however and wherever you see fit, but you are absolutely embarrassingly wrong if you think that me adding marginal selling pressure by spending my coins as much as possible is the only path to long-term success. I would argue that it is counterproductive in some ways; you're effectively decreasing demand for Bitcoin.

So many things wrong with this comment / opinion...
1) I sold plenty of coins for more than $1000 each. I've never been near Gox. You're telling me the price was never that high even though I cashed out more than my principal when it was?
2) China led the run-up during the second bubble in 2013. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or misinformed. 
3) You don't know when the bot-shenanigans began on Gox. In the willy report itself, they make direct mention of willy-like bot activities occurring *well* before Bitcoin was at ~$200. In fact, well before it was at $100! If you want to say the November bubble was illusory, get ready to toss out the April bubble too, and adjust that "price where it should be" to about $10 or so.
4) The willy report itself is based on an incomplete (and most likely tampered-with) dataset. Which came bundled with malware when it leaked. Sounds like a solid foundation to entirely base your beliefs regarding a complex topic on. /s
5) To discount the Silk Road bust being  on Google Trends, the Norwegian millionaire viral story, the US Senate hearings, the magical internet money wizard ad, and China (and Baidu)'s respective roles in the November bubble is basically to ignore reality. The # of daily visitors in this subreddit organically went from 100-200 to 1000-2000. The subscription count increased similarly. If you think the userbase inflated by a factor of ten and the market price should roughly settle back down to where it was before this expansion took place, I would appreciate a hit of whatever you're smoking.
I mean this in the least-offensive-way possible, but your opinion on the subject seems extremely naive and poorly-formed.

You said "Satoshi also believed that everyone would be solo mining on CPUs right now" - not "Satoshi wanted it to be as egalitarian as possible, and strove for an ideal of one-person-one-vote as much as possible."
While we're quoting Satoshi, let's see what he *actually* believed the future of Bitcoin mining to be (these quotes aren't misrepresented or taken out of context; these directly represent his predictions on the topic):


network grows beyond a certain point, **it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.** A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
See that part about "server farms of specialized hardware"? Yeah, think about that for a second... he's directly predicting "mining pools of ASICs" right there.
Here's another:


See how he directly acknowledges that it will be "too hard" for new users to mine a single block? That's him directly saying "in the future, everyone will **not** be solo mining on CPUs - don't believe theymos if he tries to say that I said otherwise."


Notice how he said "postpone" and not "prevent"? Notice how he acknowledged that the arms race was an inevitability? Notice how he said "anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now" and took care to deliberately specify "right now" to show that he knew this would soon not be the case any more?
You are wrong here. You almost seem to be intentionally trying to lie in the conversation. Please stop doing so; it is **very** clear that Satoshi foresaw that  everyone would **not** be solo mining on CPUs right now - your original claim was absolutely and utterly false.

Oh you mean sidechains? I'm sure they will play a meaningful role in the future.


No I am not, and you saying this just shows you don't understand my argument in the slightest. I'm looking at this from an engineering perspective and/or an economic perspective. Either one reaches the same conclusion; efficiency is the name of the game, and interchain friction is going to hurt efficiency. No ifs ands or buts.


Bitcoin hasn't "stalled", the entire value proposition of a blockchain or cryptocurrency *depends* on gridlock. You don't understand what makes a blockchain valuable, which is understandable if you blindly accept what you read in the mainstream media without putting in any critical thought, but be careful not to get into arguments with those of us that *do* understand what we're talking about.

Simple question - please quantify "different opinion". What is the magic number?
Oh, you can't? You mean to say that blindly asking for someone to "quantify x" doesn't always make sense? And that the lack of a "simple numerical answer" can actually be indicative of a bad question, rather than any deceptive intent on behalf of the person being asked the question? Huh. Funny how that works.
Now, I'm going to go above and beyond here, and take some time out of my day to address the point you are crowing about, because it is clear what you are trying to do and there's no reason that Maxwell has to take the bait when someone like me can stop by and set things perfectly straight without giving you anything that you can deliberately misquote or quote out-of-context as an "official BorgstreamCore position" like you are so obviously desperate to do.
What potentially *can* be meaningfully quantified are **costs** which serve to limit decentralization (and any potential for such). This is important, as you will see in a moment.
When you ask "what is the magic number?" but without specifying a specific numerical metric that you are referring to, no meaningful answer can be provided. A fuzzy concept like "degree of decentralization" can't be reduced down into a single authoritative numerical value (unless you wish to severely limit the scope of discussion to something in particular, which you definitely do not seem to), *but that is not to say that it cannot be impacted*. So a better way to phrase the question would be "What should we strive for, in terms of decentralization?" which can actually be answered coherently. With Bitcoin, I think it's fairly uncontroversial what we should strive for on this front: ceteris paribus, we want it to be **as decentralized as possible**. After all, Bitcoin's value proposition and unique differentiating property is precisely that it *is* a decentralized approach to remote value transfer; other networks and service providers (e.g. SWIFT, Venmo, MasterCard) are fairly suitable for the types of financial services that do not benefit from decentralization. Bitcoin, then, should be as decentralized as we can get it, so that it's unique value-add is emphasized and taken proper advantage of.
Now, this is the part where you interrupt and say "Well you just admitted that the degree of decentralization is fuzzy and not directly comprehensively quantifiable!" and try to allege that therefore we cannot have an impact on it. Once again, however, this is not true. It is illustrative to examine the extreme ends of the spectrum, to demonstrate the point.
A) Imagine that running a node and trustlessly using Bitcoin is effectively absolutely free, and that there are virtually no costs associated with doing so. In other words, I can instantly spin up a node on a mobile phone which can instantly download and verify the entire blockchain without using up any bandwidth to speak of, and there is almost no friction associated with doing so.
B) Imagine that running a node costs billions of dollars per year, and that the friction associated with doing so is massive and a totally unrealistic proposition for the vast majority of the population. In other words, running a fully validating node is cost prohibitive for almost every single person or company on Earth.
Clearly, scenario A is a much more decentralized Bitcoin than scenario B. In the most extreme example, scenario A means that it is effectively impossible for any powerful enemies of Bitcoin to prevent trustless participation in the network; anyone, anywhere is able to spin up a node (for free) and there's no reasons *not* to do so, if you are using Bitcoin at all. Scenario B is the opposite; since almost no one can afford to genuinely participate in layer-1 Bitcoin, it is absolutely trivial to prevent usage of the system at all for a large state entity (or any other powerful enemy of the network). A government could shut down Bitcoin just like they did Liberty Reserve and e-gold. In fact, other than being a silly and less efficient network model, Bitcoin would be utility-wise equivalent to these centralized services. And even if a government never bothered to shut it down, a simple DDoS attack would suffice. If 4chan got bored one day they could LOIC it for the lulz.
So clearly scenario B is a much more centralized Bitcoin than that of scenario A. Note, however, that we did not need to "quantify decentralization" rigorously to be able to see this. We are able to determine it *a priori* because the costs of node operation are an obviously relevant factor in this analysis. In other words, *we know that higher costs of running a node necessarily result in a reduction in the degree of decentralization*, and even more, we can see that it is a matter of *causation* rather than *correlation*. The affordability of node operation is a direct input when it comes to decentralization. 
Usually at this point a half-baked rebuttal is offered, along the lines of "You just took things to the extreme ends of the spectrum, which is totally ridiculous and disingenuous!" But this is incorrect and naive. The point is just as true towards the middle of the spectrum as it is on the ends (it's just easier to ignore when the differential is minimized). The fundamental axiom holds perfectly true: the cheaper it is to run a node, the more decentralized Bitcoin can be.
So if we want to maximize decentralization (and we do), we want to minimize costs of running a node, as much as is reasonably possible. We don't have to have a concrete figure that we are aiming for, we just need to know which direction we would prefer for things to move towards. 
Satoshi mentioned that he thought a large Bitcoin network would include more than "100,000 nodes" and it seems that he believed that this would probably suffice in terms of decentralization. We see much less than 10,000 running today. Perhaps you're okay with an order-of-magnitude discrepancy like that, or perhaps you'd be fine with even worse figures (less than 1000 nodes? less than 100?). No one can definitively offer a concrete cutoff figure where we can say "With X or fewer nodes, Bitcoin is centralized. With X+1 or more, it is decentralized" like you appear to be demanding, but we can certainly observe the historical trend towards lower node-counts and be legitimately concerned with the underlying causative factors being severely exacerbated. And we can, likewise, strive to minimize such impacts as much as possible, at least until we reach a point where we can see negative externalities (tradeoffs) of doing so. And as one more preemptive rebuttal to your predictable reply on this point: no, rising transaction fees are not necessarily a negative externality of the effort to minimize node costs, nor are transaction backlogs. Both of these eventualities are necessary for Bitcoin to survive the next couple of decades, and are indicative of healthy network growth.
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:50:15


On the contrary, it would appear that *you're* the one not keeping up. I see loads of healthy discussion, debate, proposals, even code... which all boils down to **Bitcoin scaling before our very eyes**.
You don't get it. The core devs with their opinions and politics and efforts **are exactly what I am referring to** when I say that these obstacles will be "summarily overcome".
Take a moment to understand my argument before trying to respond or rebut it.

And yeah, I agree, it's not good "PR for Core", but I don't think Luke-Jr is ever really seriously making PR efforts. He seems much more focused on actually strengthening Bitcoin technically (in the ways that he personally prioritizes), and with remaining consistent and honorable (again, according to his own understanding of such virtues). A hard fork candidate was promised within a few months of SegWit being released, and Luke-Jr indeed furnished one. He has always been a rather "radical" figure and has repeatedly emphasized his perspective that large blocks are having a negative impact on Bitcoin already (in his view, 1MB is too large as it is), and whether you ultimately agree or disagree with him on this point, his arguments *do* have some merit and are worth hearing out impartially. 
So he was able to uphold the promise he made (despite the miners not upholding their own), while not contributing any code that (according to him) might jeopardize the Bitcoin network and its unique value proposition. While this might not be fantastic from a PR perspective, I don't think that was ever his priority, and I don't think it should be, either.
It's totally fair to disagree with me about that. I do see both sides here. I'm just tired of people demonizing Luke-Jr when it's not warranted and rationalizing the act of ignoring or dismissing his perspective and arguments. He takes an extreme stance on a lot of issues, and outside of Bitcoin, he has very deep religious convictions, but he's not an idiot and is extremely competent in many ways.

You're right, one is red and one is blue.


**No.** 
That is not the analogy. Stick with what I've actually said, and don't put words in my mouth.
One box is red, one is blue. That is the **only** difference. In these conditions, why would putting the toy in the red box be preferable to putting it in the blue?


**In both cases, the witness Merkle root is in "one field in the data structure".**
You're confusing yourself by straying from the original analogy. Stick with the red box and the blue box (and don't start adding in weird stuff about where the boxes are located). 
One box is red, one is blue. Why would putting a toy in the blue box be "taking on additional technical debt"? Once you can answer that, we can proceed forward, but until you do, we cannot.
So, again, don't bastardize the analogy, and simply answer the question.

The cost to double-spend an arbitrary transaction is multiple orders of magnitude larger than the cost of, say, a cup of coffee. It is perfectly reasonable to accept 0 or 1 conf transactions for relatively cheap or small purchases. 
So, yes, transactions are basically instant.


The point is that these limits are *never* going to prevent Bitcoin from continuing to be used effectively. They are illusory; as soon as they begin to actually stymy activity in any way, they will be summarily overcome. That is what is so clever about Bitcoin's design; it is open source and incentives are aligned to spur its continued development. It is not a static network that is hard-coded and unadaptive; it is **the exact opposite**. 
Again, if you think those "limits" are not going to scale effectively, you are an idiot. Period.

You're comparing a general bull market with the most volatile periods of bubbles. If you want an accurate comparison, this market is much more analogous to the state of Bitcoin in late 2012 and the first 2 months of 2013. That is to say, it was a gradual bull market (not coincidentally positioned around a reward halvening) wherein many 10-100% rises and retracements were seen, but no signs of true "Mania" had manifested.
In the coming weeks and months, you will see an *actual* bubble, and realize that you were comparing the "pre-bubble bull market" with "the bubble itself" and feel very silly.
Also, the Willy conspiracy theory is pretty dumb, for a number of reasons.

First off, this comment is garbage because OP specifically asked for an "unbiased" synopsis and you seem to have gone out of your way to make as biased of a comment as possible (including multiple outright lies and misrepresentations). However, I recognize your username and know that you're just an rbtc Buttcoiner so there's not much use getting into an argument over it; you guys ignore reason.
However, I am happy to teach you something that you admitted you are confused about:


It's pretty simple, actually, and I can help explain how this works.
Basically, if your node asks "Hey, please give me block  then my node will respond "Alright, are you upgraded to support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you). 
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it.
This is how SegWit increases the blocksize while maintaining backwards-compatibility. Pretty clever, huh?

It's weird how hard the trolls wish that Bitcoiners hadn't profited from our involvement. You guys really do reek of jealousy.


Yeah, that was the case for all the past bubbles, too. Trolls tend to rationalize away the price rises as they occur: "Well obviously I'm not buying now, it's gone up +10% per day for a week straight!"... "Well, I'll just buy after it crashes again, because obviously this is just a bubble"... "Haha, Bitcoin is crashing again, I *knew* it would have been a bad time to buy!"

What are you on about? Everything that the "representatives of Core" promised was delivered. What the miners promised was violated almost immediately. Those are the facts, like them or not. Calling them "gotcha games" is kind of weird, but you do you.
Also, I think you might be confusing me with someone else. I don't mind Bitcoin continuing to do what Bitcoin does, Bitcoin-style. The status quo is fine by me.
You seem to be the one upset with the status quo, frantically advocating a contentious hard fork to replace Nakamoto Consensus with a new and untested form of consensus (which has accidentally forked a testnet in half, causing it to ultimately be shut down and *to this day hasn't started a public testnet to replace it*, as well as unintentionally attempted to fork on mainnet due to 5th-grade-level arithmetical errors committed directly to the master branch on a "1.0" release)... all I can say is, that's an interesting altcoin you bunch have got there. Have fun with it.

@_date: 2017-02-03 04:28:19


It might be the most textbook example of a false dichotomy I've ever seen.
You're making this out to be *far* more complicated than it actually is. 
This is, to put it simply, an economic market. There is supply (available space in the blocks) and demand (desire to have Bitcoin transactions confirmed). We can discuss the relative elasticity of this demand if you'd like, but it's (at best) tangential to the root point here, which is that **ultimately, an equilibrium will manifest**, almost axiomatically. 
To break it down into nicer language: some people want or need certain transactions to confirm quickly. Other people would like to make a transaction, but aren't in any rush, and would be fine waiting for significant lengths of time before receiving a finalized confirmation. Others are in between. Regardless of who you are, you can pay a fee appropriate to your needs, and have realistic expectations about when your transactions are "as good as gold". If the market prices out some transactions as uneconomical, that is normal and fine. After all, these transactions have to be processed, and processing is *not* free. In the end, though, the market will establish "normal" fee-rates, where some transactions are priced out and others are not, and the market actors will respond accordingly. 
We can go on a much deeper dive here, and talk in more depth about what specific value the equilibrium might trend towards, what sorts of market shocks could occur (and what effects they might have), the role of negative feedback loops in equilibrium convergence, and much more, but suffice to say: it's not a matter of "either spiral infinitely out-of-control and explode or necessarily break down due to prolonged droughts of demand" as you seem to be arguing.
And no, the idea of a "centrally planned fee" is not a good solution, nor a realistic alternative to letting the market establish the appropriate rates over time.

And just to follow-up with my own thoughts on the subject, I think you're absolutely right. I'm glad altcoins exist. I'm not holding my breath that any particular one will dethrone Bitcoin or even grab a significant fraction of its network, but I definitely am happy to see innovation in the space, and people trying out new things. It's a shame so many are pump-n-dumps, but it would be stupid to say that they *all* are.

Oh, it sounds like you're just not very knowledgeable when it comes to large online communities. Once any forum/subreddit/online-club gets too big (usually about 70k-100k users will do it, though that's not a firm number) the average post quality will inevitably decline dramatically and the noise will begin drowning out the signal. This is a sad truth of internet communities. The phenomenon was named, long ago, the Eternal September.
The only known way to combat this (assuming you allow the community to grow past such a point) is with moderation. Period.
You probably don't have any experience moderating a large forum or community online, I take it? That's ok, most don't. But it's an arduous affair, and especially so *if your community is swarmed or attacked by a hostile agency*. It is clear (and beyond dispute at this point) that has been under a persistent attack by malicious actors (many of whom frequent rbtc) for many months now. The moderators *have* to uphold the rules of the subreddit to allow any serious discussion to have any chance of taking place.


That "controversy" is probably exactly why Reddit praised them! Despite the subreddit being consistently brigaded, the mod team has done an excellent job of keeping the subreddit quality intact! It really is an impressive feat, and one deserving of praise.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:43:58
The idea would be that Roger uses his influence to get the technical illiterates (i.e. everyone in rbtc) to support the Core Capacity Roadmap, thereby uniting the community in support of scaling Bitcoin together.
Also, you seem to be revising history a bit... Maxwell and Luke-Jr (or more accurately Bitcoin Core) *did* offer a compromise: a blocksize increase via SegWit. One side has been making solid arguments, offering compromises, and writing (and reviewing) great code to scale Bitcoin. The other side (led by Ver) has been moving goalposts and talking shit.

There is literally no advantage to doing so. No benefits whatsoever.
The dollar is already digital. Trying to make it into some weird cryptocurrency-minus-the-blockchain doesn't actually help anyone in any way. It solves no problems.
If you try to introduce a blockchain for your bitDollar idea, you get a bunch of inefficiency and require a complex balance of incentives to allow it to progress and survive... and it **still** doesn't offer *any benefits whatsoever*, because the point of a blockchain is decentralization. A blockchain costs you in efficiency, bandwidth and storage usage, and expenses, **but manages to achieve decentralization**.
That is the benefit of a blockchain. That is what it achieves. It doesn't magically make things cheaper.
Your "bitDollars" idea doesn't make any sense, and quite frankly just goes to show that you don't understand the dollar, the blockchain, or cryptocurrencies in general.

One greatly exacerbatory factor (especially in a hypothetical Unlimited paradigm) is the Great Firewall of China, which is a  notorious source of latency and network friction for Bitcoin (not to mention the Internet itself). Blocks over 4MB in size would be at a distinct competitive disadvantage if they were on the minority side of the Great Firewall relative to the rest of the hashrate, where each propagated block has to traverse over it. 
Currently, significantly more than 50% of Bitcoin's hashrate is concentrated into Chinese mining pools. They already enjoy competitive advantages stemming from their geographical proximity to one another (i.e. subtle centralization pressure does already exist), but [research indicates]( that this would be dramatically worsened by blocks larger than 4MB.
With an approach like Unlimited (i.e. a flexcap proposal that does not attempt to disincentivize or mitigate unchecked cap growth, or what might be called an *incentive-naive flexcap proposal*), the Chinese mining pools would be most profitable over the short and medium term by coordinating their EB/AD signaling to gradually increase the block cap over time. As orphan rates on the opposite side of the Great Firewall from them inexorably grew, the only way to preserve/protect/increase your bottom line as a miner outside of China would be to point your hashpower to one of the pools within it. In simple terms, Unlimited + The Great Firewall + Time = Centralized Bitcoin.
An excellent breakdown of this phenomenon/principle was provided by [Peter Todd long ago](

That's a strong possibility, but I'd like to point out that Coinbase has a history of relatively-huge announcements without any preamble. It would be somewhat "out of character" of them to overhype something before it happens.

"Try" does not imply intent, actually. It's so strange to me when someone attempts to make something a semantic debate without bothering to check into the relevant definitions.
In particular, software is able to try to do things that the programmer(s) never intended it to do. My classic example is a database retrieval call before initiating a database connection. This would represent the software *trying* to retrieve a record (and failing) even though the call didn't work.
Similarly, BU *tried* to fork. The programmers (and Roger) didn't mean for it to, but through developer incompetence, the attempt was still made.

Fiat is not perfectly secure; nothing is. Perfect security is an impossible Platonic ideal. Such has been my point ever since I identified your line of argumentation. 
Here's the reality: statistics regarding Bitcoin thefts are **entirely irrelevant** to my point(s)... unless, of course, those statistics demonstrate that absolutely 100% of Bitcoin transactions fail. Which, of course, they don't. I've been patiently reminding you of this, but of course you have ignored this fact because it is tantamount to admitting defeat.

Only if your debts are denominated in the deflationary currency.
In the case of Bitcoin, why would you do this? Why not take out loans in dollars, and then buy bitcoins if you want them instead? In the real world, of course, that's the rational thing to do. Anyone who is foolheaded enough to do it backwards deserves what they get.
So, with this in mind, there aren't any drawbacks to high deflation, as long as there is at least one serious inflationary currency alternative.

Upon expenditure (or conversion into another good, service, or money) the security of the asset in question is no longer relevant from your perspective. It is not your problem to secure bitcoins that don't belong to you any more.
By any meaningful definition of the term "wealth", a sum of bitcoins qualifies. I see what you were trying to do, and it was an admirable effort, but in all honesty there can be no argument here.
Holding is using. Value stored in bitcoin is wealth.

You're rationalizing the peg's failure, offering explanations for why it doesn't work and saying "But once people start using this, it will work so much better!"
I am not making any sweeping claims about what is or is not possible with a blockchain. I'm merely acknowledging empirical evidence that Bitshares' pegging mechanism **does not work**.

I think you're unclear how interchangeably you use "society" and "government" in your explanation of your beliefs. Language shapes thought, and it truly seems your thoughts involve a 1:1 correlation between "society" and "government" yet (as evidenced by your reply) you yourself do not even seem fully aware of doing so.
When a government demands taxes, it is not a sound practice to say "this is society demanding taxes" because the two are not isomorphic. This approach lacks rigor and the conclusions you draw from such reasoning are questionable at best.

Satoshi was explaining to Jeff Garzik that a hard fork is *possible* (because Jeff Garzik was arguing that it was totally impossible) and posted a simple example of how one might work.

That is just one of its design goals. A few others:
1) Do not take on extra risk unnecessarily.

3) Protect Bitcoin from known (and unknown) exploits and attack vectors as it scales.

5) Prevent Bitcoin from succumbing to a populist bastardization and any slippery slope this might represent.
6) Keep developer effort in Bitcoin unified to maximize code quality and peer review.

To be clear, there are very few (if any) developers and members of the technical community who think that hard forks are categorically dangerous; in general, the understanding is that *hard forks require thorough consideration* because they *can* be dangerous (especially if poorly executed or performed without widespread agreement/unanimity on the change(s) made).
No prominent developers in the space are adamantly opposed to hard forks in principle, and to date I have never heard a single Core developer argue that we should *never* hard fork Bitcoin under any circumstances. The general perspective is instead that *controversial* hard forks should be avoided if at all possible, for a number of technological, social, and philosophical reasons (some of which I will try to elaborate on momentarily).

Saying "Bitcoin never hit $x" is a different statement entirely from "Bitcoin only hit $x because of artificial bot activity." My first point serves to demonstrate this distinction, if you read closely and interpret the language precisely.


Again, your fault here is an imprecision of language. I never said the words "vast adoption and investment". I said Chinese exchanges led the market during the November bubble, and without a doubt they did 97% of the time. This doesn't mean that multitudes of Chinese people started buying bitcoins; you can make that claim if you want, but you'll notice that I never did. It is just an observation that large market movements began on Chinese exchanges and, for the most part, during Chinese trading hours. Every night when China would wake up, we would see volume pick up considerably (both on the fee-free BTCChina and on Western exchanges) and huge movements take place. There wasn't room for doubt. 
You can go back and reassess the data from that same time period, and compare the timestamps of impetus trades prior to big movements. You will immediately see the Chinese influence on the market. Again, look at BTCChina; Huobi and OKcoin only really rose in popularity after BTCC was stomped by the PBoC.

You did the math on the roulette odds, but not on the Bitcoin odds.


I certainly do. I think the odds are much better than that, in fact. And my rationale for believing so is that I still believe that the same reasons why Bitcoin has appreciated in value in the past still hold true.


Why would only one more bubble be possible? Again, the pattern should logically only stop if something fundamental has changed and broken the pattern. So perhaps Bitcoin will appreciate to $2500 in a year, when it bubbles again, and then a year later (after a horrendous crash down to a mere $1100!) it bubbles again to $12,000, and then a couple years later again to $30,000, etc, etc.
I'm not saying that this will happen. I'm saying that it's a perfectly fair stance to take to expect it to happen, *if you believe that Bitcoin's price growth so far has been a result of its continued network expansion and adoption, and that this adoption stands a solid chance of continuing.* 
Me? I'm a hopeless optimist. I think it will continue to grow, and I think it will be jaw-droppingly lucrative as it does. Maybe I'll be wrong in the end, but I have yet to find an argument (other than "it was all fraudulent, Willy pumped it all and the growth we've seen so far was illusory!") that ludicly outlines why the Bitcoin network should stop gaining traction and users, so I like our odds. It doesn't hurt that I've cashed out more than my principal investment already, having noticed the bubble cycle (and invested accordingly) prior to the last run-up. But hey, we'll see!

Fortunately you don't have to buy it. My profits don't care.
Curiously enough, I didn't even mean to sell most of the coins that I sold in December -- long story.

Here is the source of the Satoshi quote: 
It's a great comment and speaks volumes about Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin. He even describes the SegWit upgrade path as the correct upgrade path.
As for "who is a Bitcoin expert" it primarily boils down to those who have meaningfully participated and contributed to the bitcoin-dev mailing list and Bitcoin source code over the years. There are hundreds of such people, almost all of whom (in some sense or another) have helped to shape Bitcoin Core into what it is today.

Oh, I see. You weren't lying, you just have a severe misunderstanding on the matter. I apologize for assuming the worst.
All that quote means is "if there are a non-negligible number of SegWit nodes running, there is no risk". Since we can already see thousands of SegWit nodes on the network (which is *more* than sufficient), there is no such risk.

I didn't want to know where he works. I wanted to know what his "disruptive, paradigm changing" elevator pitch was. You don't have to give the name of your company or any contact information to make an elevator pitch. A brief synopsis should be sufficient (in fact, that's the definition of an elevator pitch).
I see why your comments don't make any sense now. You thought I asked where he worked, but I didn't.
Since we can rule out your original theory that he's trying to avoid being contacted by evangelical Bitcoiners, that basically means the most likely *actual* explanation is that doesn't have an actual startup or elevator pitch (or does, and knows that it is terrible). Just another instance of Buttcoiners lying to try and strengthen their arguments, it seems.

I'm not skipping one step at all. You're actually being intentionally dishonest in one step: specifically step 3:


I can (and do) transfer Bitcoin securely on a regular basis. I have singlehandedly disproven this point with actual hard evidence.
Your argument earlier was that hypotheticals exist wherein Bitcoin transactions are insecure. I (quite effortlessly) countered this with my own hypothetical of being mugged as you try to pay for a pack of gum, to demonstrate that all other forms of wealth suffer from imperfect security.
Even with FDIC insurance, hypotheticals can easily be generated wherein one's wealth is lost due to one factor or another. Plenty of these have historical precedent. 
You've gradually resorted more and more to a fictional universe where it is absolutely impossible to make a single successful Bitcoin transaction without losing it. Fortunately for me and anyone else who is not being deliberately disingenuous, this is a comical delusion; once again, **I can and have used Bitcoin without problems on numerous occasions**. I require no assumptions of the future; I can rely on actual factual occurrences.
Since it is obvious at this point you are not interested in rational discourse, and would rather utterly ignore the reality of the situation in favor of your obtusely-negative fantasy, I am rapidly losing interest in this conversation. If you want to have a real discussion, I would be happy to do so, but it's a waste of both of our times if you would rather just steep yourself deep in some weird fantasy for the sake of doing so.

~@_date: 2017-03-27 02:32:17
Ok, I'm glad to hear you've read the Roadmap and put some thought into the matter.
Before addressing your primary point, I just want to take a moment and point out that *every single goal of the Roadmap has been achieved*, exactly as promised and committed-to by Core a year and a half ago. The only remaining initiative to work on is the flexcap proposal(s), but those are contingent on the data that we get out of SegWit going live; in other words, the strategy put forth in the Roadmap is being held up by SegWit remaining unactivated by the miners (who promised to signal for and activate it, and subsequently inexplicably reneged on the promise).
This is an important factor to consider. Core has upheld their end of the bargain commendably and thoroughly, but for whatever reason, the mining pools aren't cooperating and upholding *their* end. 
What this says, to me, is that Core has been acting in good faith. They've made good on everything they can, and now they're just waiting for reciprocation before they finish out the last bullet point, as promised.
Also, the fact that the miners have abstained from working towards a smooth SegWit activation tells us something else very important: clearly, the "blocksize crisis" wasn't really a crisis at all. Even with a safe blocksize increase (SegWit) waiting in the wings, miners appear to be comfortable stalling and maintaining the current size limit. And Bitcoin is *not* catastrophically imploding (as predicted by Mike Hearn and his army of FUDsters); it's hovering just under $1000 a coin, apparently awaiting progress on the scaling front (which, again, is being held back by miners only) before surging any further.
Ok, so I hope you respect that point, and see why it's important to acknowledge. Now onto your primary point...
What do you propose as a "rock solid metric" that we can quantify "decentralization" by? Keep in mind that most metrics can be gamed; for instance, node count can be artificially inflated with AWS instances and illusory pass-through nodes. We've seen this happen with XT, Classic, and BU, in fact. 
There's little benefit (other than the flimsy illusion of community support) to doing so today, but if Core *strongly commits* to "node count" as the defining metric, and says "If node count decreases by X%, we will Y" then suddenly there is a real reason to game the metric, and the stats we get are inherently suspect.
Of course, node count *should* be factored in, to a degree; we need full nodes for a healthy and decentralized Bitcoin. But defining hard thresholds that we base future proposals on suddenly creates an incentive to spoof node count, to further (possibly antagonistic) scaling agendas with.
Other potential metrics (at least the ones that I can dream up) suffer from the same shortcoming. 
It's far better to let the genius engineers with proven track records, who have consistently demonstrated total commitment to Bitcoin's best interests for years and years, to use their best judgments on the matter, and work out (with community input, of course!) what they think are relevant metrics and data points when the time comes. 
In short, trying to reduce this down to a "black and white" problem is a dangerous and foolhardy approach. There is a lot to consider, and we need to do our best as a community to vet all the data we can as it becomes available. Sometimes it won't be cleanly quantifiable and thresholds won't make sense, other times, it will be easier to graph out and numerically analyze. It's our duty to consider all the shades of grey, too.

The data is comprised of the exchange order books themselves. Watching the tickers in real-time is always the best way to get an impression of how things are playing out, but I can show you [a couple of quick snapshots of big dumps]( to give you an idea of what I am referring to.
Notice that the interval is set to 1 minute, meaning each bar represents 60 seconds' worth of time. And the important values are the volume bars (which are shown at the bottom of the charts). You can clearly see multiple examples of thousands of bitcoins dumped completely out-of-the-blue in otherwise-low-volume contexts, where the sell orders were placed and executed in a single minute (or up to 5 minutes).
These are not indicative of sale behavior which aims to maximize fiat profits from the proceeds, which would instead be trickled out slowly to prevent slippage from occurring. These are dumps, and they appear deliberate rather than bot-triggered.
The opinion is echoed in here and there. Rarely do people take the time to compile screenshots to archive data regarding such behavior, and I'm unaware of any outside sources that are compiling such reports. Most of the conclusions are results of watching the ticker in live-time, which is an altogether different experience from analyzing historical screenshots.

You know how I know you're not a developer and have little-to-no experience with OSS (or coordinated software development in general)?
This is how:


Bitcoin Core isn't centralized. Bitcoin Core *is* Bitcoin (and has been so since the beginning, before it was even called Core), and as such, every developer who has been interested in helping to develop Bitcoin and strengthening it over the years has contributed their efforts to Core. It is a decentralized organization of Bitcoin developers which only merges in uncontroversial and widely-reviewed updates. It is conservative (as it should be) and has a policy of "without consensus, maintain status quo" which is exactly what an autonomous immutable distributed technology *needs*.
Satoshi said that competing implementations (like BU) would be "a menace to the network" and everyone who has a thorough understanding of Bitcoin on a technical level agrees with this. It's not surprising to see you argue "Satoshi (and every other Bitcoin expert) was wrong!" because your side abandoned rationality long ago.

Whether you want to believe it or not, the same underlying factors that drove Bitcoin to $1000 are still very much in play, and $1000 is not some magical upper limit in terms of price.

Yeah, if you read rbtc, you're going to wind up killing brain cells.


From the very way that you phrased this question, it's clear that you don't understand Bitcoin transactions (much less SegWit transactions), but I'll skip that for now.
If a block is mined including a violation of the script predicates of a transaction regarding witness data, that is, by definition, **invalid** and would not be Bitcoin. That is exactly right.
But this isn't some effect of SegWit. I can mine a block including transactions which ignore the script predicates of their inputs today, with pre-SegWit code. It would be an invalid block, of course, so the rest of the network would reject it (just like they would with SegWit)...
You seem confused, so hopefully that helps.


What? Again, from the way you are phrasing your questions, it sounds like you really aren't equipped with enough terminological knowledge to be able to even parse what I'm saying.

**Long-term supply constraints is an obvious example.** A centralized coin could be inflated on a whim by the dictator.
Arguably, this benefit of decentralization is **more important** than censorship resistance, at least to some of us. I've listed multiple other such benefits the last few times you've parroted this tripe, too.
So please stop pretending like censorship-resistance is the only thing decentralization is good for. It's not.

Chains longer than 100 are *probably* excludable in an analysis like this one, at least this early on in Bitcoin's life. Chains longer than 1000, certainly.
But chains longer than 10? No way. Normal wallet maintenance and coin acquisition can, often enough, put your coins on such a chain. Any subsequent use of these perfectly-valid and perfectly-normal coins is going to be filtered out by this analysis. Absurdly so. There is absolutely no reason to have such a preposterously low threshold. You're basically only looking at freshly-mined coins and coins that were sent directly to cold storage at that point, which doesn't tell you anything useful.
 Why did you pick 10? Show me the thought process that went into this. Was it "oh look I found a graph"?

You mentioned that you don't follow Ethereum particularly closely, so just as a quick bit of information: last year, Ethereum had to hard-fork *multiple times* to address various DoS bugs. These bugs were all imbalances between particular operations' fee-costs and the burden that such operations could introduce on the network via malicious exploitation. In other words, clever attackers figured out that they could spend *very little* in terms of fees, while still making the miners expend *very much* in terms of processing/load. This represented a class of vulnerabilities; basically, if you knew what you were doing, you could render Ethereum totally inaccessible to everyone else by just spending a couple bucks in an annoying way. Once this was proven in the real world, the Ethereum developers had to scramble to code up hard-fork fixes that updated the fee-costs of these sorts of operations (making the cost of the transactions more accurately reflect the burden they represented to the network under adversarial conditions).
Why do I bring this up? Well, unfortunately, Bitcoin has a similar problem. In fact, in Bitcoin, the problem is particularly pernicious, because the incentives are aligned so that *everyone* is a little bit of an "attacker" on the network. In short, with how transaction fee rates are handled today, transactors can (and usually do) incur *more cost on the network* than their transaction fees compensate for. There is an unfortunate imbalance here; basically, by solely incentivizing the minimization of "total number of bytes" in a transaction, the skew is towards a growing UTXO set, which is costlier on nodes than archived block data. Average users are (unintentionally) transacting in long-term aggregate-inefficient ways, by ignoring the impact that they make on the UTXO set and minimizing byte count only. 
This is a problem that has been lamented for years now (going back to 2011, if I'm not mistaken). Fortunately, with blocks capped at 1MB, it's not *too bad* of a problem, but there is a legitimate worry that a significantly larger cap might dramatically worsen this skew. If the UTXO set grows unchecked, the memory costs of node operation can grow in very undesirable ways.
Directly increasing the blocksize incurs a risk on this front. You may not think that severe UTXO growth is that huge of problem, but besides increasing node costs, it also definitely exacerbates other (soon-to-be-mentioned) problems by increasing the time and cost of block validation.

I'll paste what I consider to be the "meat" of the paper, in case you're interested:


Basically, a user provides a signature template that can be used to reduce the amount of data necessary in future transactions. This, of course, means that all those future transactions using this template are directly linked to that user/key/template.
Some standard address reuse issues, like the revelation of the public key, are not actually issues under the LTCP approach. Others (like the definite loss of privacy for relevant transactions) most certainly are.

The mempool needs a persistent set of transactions in it, actually. If every waiting transaction confirms in a single block, [Bitcoin will not work as transaction fees supplant block rewards]( and it will not survive to 2035.

I believe I can help here, since you seem to be confused. The primary insight you seem to lack is that a 19MB sidechain is not the only possible type of sidechain. 
Pieter Wuille was explaining that a naive/direct approach (just using a huge-block sidechain and hoping really hard that this is the answer to your scaling problems) is not a realistic solution.
The quote you've provided does **not** say "sidechains are incapable of helping Bitcoin scale" or "sidechains will never allow increased Bitcoin transaction throughput", and in fact, both of these claims are pretty obviously incorrect. You'd have to be rather shortsighted and unimaginative to actually believe such claims (and I don't believe Pieter is either).

Satoshi reasoned that everyday users would be able to get by with limited trust by using "SPV clients", but unfortunately true SPV is more complicated than was first assumed, and to date we do not have actual SPV-clients as envisioned by Satoshi. This means that lite clients and lite wallets, unfortunately, are more vulnerable and trusty than Satoshi had originally planned for them to be.
We don't have solid fraud proofs for SPV-type clients right now. This means that any additional reliance on lite clients (which increased costs of node operation definitionally incurs) is another way to say "reliance on trust" which, again, violates Bitcoin's entire purpose.
A "standard" blocksize increase would incur further strain on node operators, pushing towards further usage of lite clients, without making any progress towards fraud proofs or SPV solutions. In other words, it could be argued to be "a step in the wrong direction" from a decentralist's perspective.

I definitely think we should do exactly that.
Right now, it looks like SegWit is the best way to do so. The unfortunate caveat is that miners will not benefit as much as users from the SegWit upgrade, so they are not rushing to activate it (even though it is the safest and most intelligent upgrade proposal on the table).

This is *exactly* why Satoshi wrote and Incorporated the Script language in the first place. [He explained, directly, that this was how Bitcoin was designed to be upgraded](










This isn't "a clear danger to the owners of those nodes" at all, this was literally the upgrade path that Satoshi advocated, and the one we have all been planning on following since the very beginning.

"Some scam email"? Are you just resorting to making stuff up now?
Gardner's report has been verified by the BU devs (after they, too, initially lied about it). She also submitted a CVE report beforehand, which will corroborate her report (and the timeline of disclosure) in a month or so; I don't expect you to understand what CVEs are, because you're obviously clueless and know very little about pretty much everything in this space, but suffice to say, the details of the discovery and disclosure of the vulnerabilities aren't really in dispute at this point.
Beyond that, as I pointed out above, Roger *already admitted that what he said was wrong*.
You are pretending there is doubt where there is none. In so doing, you have exposed yourself as a malicious actor.  Congratulations, you are an enemy of Bitcoin; I now consider you hostile (as do many others, clearly, as we can see from this thread alone).

There is no such thing...
There's moderation (which is necessary for a community of this size) and a rule not to promote software that would break the Bitcoin consensus model... but you're free to discuss whatever you want.
If you deliberately ignore and break this rule, and make sockpuppet accounts to brigade this subreddit and continue promoting malicious software, your posts end up getting filtered out (as they should, and in fact you should be banned by reddit for violating their ToS by circumventing bans with new accounts) a little more severely, but that's pretty darn reasonable!

@_date: 2017-02-15 16:30:37


Well, first you have to realize that those are 3 separate questions.
It can compete with fiat currencies in a number of ways, but the "killer app" in this fight is its scarcity, which makes it deflationary relative to fiat currencies. Programmability and monetary sovereignty are two other critical components of Bitcoin that set it apart from fiat currencies in a beneficial way.
As for credit cards, Bitcoin itself won't compete with them. It could be the underlying asset upon which a credit card is backed, of course, but Bitcoin itself can't offer you credit, nor should it try to. Creditors will still exist, even if Bitcoin completely takes over the world.
As for debit cards, once again they can use Bitcoin as the underlying asset (a la a Shift card), but Bitcoin can also compete in newer and fancier ways because no credit is necessary. Lightning Network is functionally like a debit card in a lot of ways.


No, once again, **you're missing the point**, which is that the blocksize is not a problem. It can be increased if there is a good reason to, but **there is not a good reason to increase it right now, and many good reasons not to**.


LN would actually likely have a *far* bigger impact than that. You can do millions of transactions per second on the Lightning Network, and then every month or so, "settle" these transactions into Bitcoin. This means that even though you made millions and millions of transactions total, only 2 (the "opening of your LN channel" and the "closing of the channel") have to be stored in the blockchain. For small payments, LN increases scalability by a factor of thousands or millions.
And I haven't even gone into other cool scaling solutions. But I shouldn't have to, because the point is that **there is not a problem right now**. Limited block space is a **good thing**.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:46:44

A few Core devs are employees of Blockstream, many of whom have been absolutely legendary in terms of getting Bitcoin to where it is today and paving the way for where it will be in the years to come. To list a few of their recent contributions off the top of my head: Libsecp256k1, SegWit, Schnorr signature aggregation, Mimblewimble, sidechains in general, Lightning Network, massive relay network efficiency gains, significant improvements in terms of Tor support and block pruning, countless patches of vulnerabilities that I can guarantee you weren't even aware of until they were fixed, and that's not to mention the continual stream of open peer review and conceptual collaboration they have provided over the years.
Honestly, crawl back under your bridge, troll. The adults are talking.

Yes, sure. No argument from me. That  would be supply contraint. 
If it were under centralized control, the hypothetical inflation you refer to would not necessarily be "constant" nor "known" because the central controller could adjust inflation as they see fit, at any time. In a centrally-controlled sysyem, you would be forced to trust that central authority to not do so.

Satoshi was the original small-blocker and expended extraordinary effort into trying to make Bitcoin more scalable while keeping the size of the chain as small and lean as possible.
There are plenty of Satoshi quotes that concern how we should try to limit the size of the chain's growth and the costs of synching and validating it, there are plenty of Satoshi quotes discussing how we should be transitioning to fee-based incentives within the first 20 years of Bitcoin's life, there are plenty of Satoshi quotes where he contradicts everything you're trying to say.
Your appeal to authority has fallen flat because you are selectively ignoring almost everything that authority said, and focusing on one or two comments out of context through a pinhole, and demonstrating that you don't understand the subject of discussion even slightly in the process.

I would strongly recommend that you do a great deal more research before trying to recount history like you are here.
You can very easily tell apart those who pay attention and do their research from those who merely hang out on Reddit and "sorta kinda pay attention", occasionally going so far as to read Gavin's blog.
It truly astounds me that so many people are willing to pretend like they have followed Core development over the years, when it is so obvious that they have done no such thing.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:23:23


His (far from comprehensive) list was an amalgamation of the discussions that had been had in the years prior to the BIP101 initiative. If you read the mailing list linked in the OP, you'll see that Gavin had not attempted to discuss the subject with other developers in Core before publishing his rapid-fire blogposts. In fact, his clear attempt to route *around* peer review is what prompted the thread in question. 


How can you say this? That is exactly the opposite of true! 
Prior to Gavin's blogposts, *all protocol development discussion* was done via forums (BitcoinTalk), IRC, and the dev mailing list. 
Gavin apparently decided, out of the blue, that he was going to "change things up" by releasing blogposts this time instead (as apparently not-so-coincidentally Mike Hearn was doing the same thing). They had conspired in secret to fork the Bitcoin project (as is proven by the leaked emails from Satoshi's inbox -- also linked to in the email thread from the OP) *before ever even attempting to discuss the fork with other developers in the space*. 
I am not kidding here. Read the history (it's all linked above). These are cold, hard facts. Gavin and Mike decided that rather than trying to participate in discussions with other developers on the subject, that they would team up and release a bunch of blog posts and a consensus-incompatible client together (which Mike Hearn would unilaterally control) which they would try to get the ecosystem to adopt.
The thread above is **damning**. It's clear now, in retrospect, that this was a deliberate coup attempt. Also, interesting to note that Mike Hearn was almost certainly employed by R3 at the time.


The blog posts would have made great *supplemental* material, sure. But ideally they would have come *after* a bona fide attempt at getting a technical proposal for a controversial hard fork peer reviewed.

[Here's an article on PCWorld which says that XT "elicited support from popular figures like Roger Ver"](
[Here's an article on The New Yorker which says](


The [Bitcoin Classic Wikipedia page lists him as a supporter of the project]( because in the [EconoTimes]( it states that "Bitcoin Classic has received support from... Roger Ver".
[Here's a newsBTC article talking about Roger offering "double the block reward" on his **Bitcoin Classic mining pool** in an effort to "promote Bitcoin Classic"](
[Here's a BitcoinMagazine article talking about Roger being "determined to keep trying to fork Bitcoin" despite his previous attempts with Classic and XT failing.](
There are dozens more articles. Roger Ver **strongly** advocated BitcoinXT, he **strongly** advocated Bitcoin Classic, and is now strongly advocating BU. You are a liar, you owe the poster you (incorrectly) called a liar an apology, and you should be ashamed of yourself.

@_date: 2014-07-28 18:40:48


Haha, no. This is overstating the risk, to put it lightly. To put it bluntly, this is FUD.


You appear to misunderstand the mining process greatly. "Substantial mining payouts" are not strictly required to guarantee network security. Rather, a high network hashrate is required. Conflating those two things is like mixing up mathematical symbols when doing algebra; you'll still be able to perform your operations/logic, but the results or conclusions you reach will be nonsense.
The irreversibility being consumer-unfriendly point still stands, though. Great pains need to be taken to protect your coins, especially at this early stage when there aren't really any completely trustworthy and guaranteed-to-be-good-for-it companies out there.

The blocksize is not a spam limit, and never was. That is a myth.
When Satoshi first introduced minimum-relay fees, he called them "a first attempt" at limiting spam, despite this being many months after the blocksize limit was first introduced.
Since your original assumptions on the matter were obviously incorrect, which indicates that you do not yet know the *actual* rationale behind the blocksize limit in Bitcoin, do you perhaps want to take some time to read up on the subject before trying to argue about it any further?

Debunked thoroughly in the first few paragraphs of [this comment](


"Satoshi's successor"? Uhhh, maybe that's what Gavin likes to *call himself*, but it's not really accurate at all. Satoshi certainly never dubbed him anything like that. 
Also, Gavin didn't step down as lead maintainer until [2014]( More blatant lying.


Literally **no Core developer has ever once said anything like this**. In fact, the [Core Capacity Roadmap]( which was [signed by many of the most active developers]( explicitly lists increasing the blocksize (and flexcap proposals) as priorities that Core wants to work on. 
You are unable to provide a *single* instance, of a *single* Core developer, *ever* saying "the block size limit should never be raised for any reason". Not one. At all.


No, not accurate in the slightest. Sidechains aren't a scaling solution. They were never intended nor marketed as such. They are an extensibility solution; a way for bitcoins to be able to do anything that any altcoin can do. They do not, in and of themselves, help with scaling.


Also grossly inaccurate. There was no consensus on increasing the blocksize via a hardfork because it was [almost unanimously opposed by every single developer in Bitcoin]( This wasn't a case of "Wladimir saying" something, this was a case of **the proposal getting totally rejected by every single engineer working on Bitcoin at the time, for a long list of reasons**, and Gavin ignoring the peer review and saying "Fine Mike and I are forking off to do this regardless; we were planning to do this months ago privately without ever even trying to get your support anyway!"


They were [**not** ignored]( they were *rejected* by the technical community. 


Before ever even beginning work on BIP101 or BitcoinXT. This is a case of switching around the timelines.


If DDoS attacks are able to "stop the progress" of *any* proposal, that proposal is obviously unsound. Bitcoin lives in the real world, where DDoS attacks are a fact of life. If your code can't survive DDoS attacks, it isn't ready for primetime. Period.


Finally, we have an accurate statement! [Though Mike Hearn is more accurately described as the "unilateral dictator" of BitcoinXT, having explicitly said that he thinks Bitcoin *needs* a leader and that he would always have "the final say" over any proposals or code changes).


If by "censorship" this means "heavier moderation", that's correct. 


Nope, inaccurate. The actual rule is: *Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.*


Total lie. Apparently *many* hours were spent, during the meeting, to clarify this point, and make sure that it was translated accurately and well-understood among all attendees. 


That and the fact that Classic was exposed as a farce when one of the Toomim brothers (who controlled the repository) went and trolled the Bitcoin Core Slack channel on acid. Oh, and let's take note of the fact that multiple pools continued to signal Classic blocks (in *direct violation* of the Hong Kong Agreement), violating the agreement mere days after it was signed.


Inaccurate. SegWit has had [closer to 30%]( signaling for quite some time, now.


This is *completely* false. [SegWit is a blocksize increase]( and no data whatsoever is put "outside the block" in any way at all. Yet another blatant lie.


That's not an example of technical debt; in fact, the "new transaction formats which must be supported forever" is just another usage of P2SH, meaning this is *totally* inaccurate. What makes this lie even worse is the fact that SegWit [*reduces* technical debt](


Not true. Bitcoin.com has already tried (and failed) to fork the network, when less than 20% of hashrate was signaling support for BU. So much for the "safe hard fork scaling plan", huh?


This is all true.


False. It, in fact, introduces a case of "divergent persistence"; the blocksize controversy would be a permanent problem in Bitcoin if BU somehow got its way.


No, it doesn't. Another lie. One of the worst properties of BU is that it has almost *no* protections whatsoever against a wide array of blocksize-based attack vectors.


False. SegWit provides an immediate scaling fix and BU does not. This is exactly backwards.
The final paragraph pretends that Core developers (of which there are hundreds, who have been working on Bitcoin development for *years* and have proven track records) are in any way comparable to the BU developers (none of whom have any track records, and who [are totally, provably, consistently incompetent]( You can't even *try* to pretend like Core are on the same level as BU, in terms of development expertise and code quality. That is a boldfaced lie.
The whole post is full of lies. Almost every single thing in it was a lie.

This is actually one of the most brilliant qualities that Satoshi programmed into Bitcoin: every 2016 blocks (which, at an average of one block per ten minutes works out to about two weeks), all the miners calculate how long it took to mine those blocks. If it took less than two weeks to mine them all, then they "adjust the mining difficulty upwards" (which I'll explain in a moment) and if it took more than 2 weeks, they adjust it downwards instead.
The "mining difficulty" basically just means "how unlikely is it for a miner to find a successful block", so when it goes up, it gets harder to find blocks (it takes more processing power and is thus more expensive). If a particular miner doesn't adjust their difficulty up when the rest of the network does, their "easy to mine" blocks will be treated as invalid by the rest of the network and be ignored, so they don't win any bitcoins and make no money.
So what does all this difficulty stuff have to do with the question you asked? Well, it keeps everything in balance, pretty much regardless of how many miners there are and how much hashpower they represent. If a bunch of miners decide "Screw it, it's not worth it to mine any more!" and turn off their mining rigs, then shortly afterwards the difficulty will be adjusted down (because there are less miners mining, so it will take longer to find the blocks on average), which means that the miners who did *not* quit are suddenly more profitable!
So there's always a balance. If people stop mining, the difficulty will go down, and those still mining will get better returns. If lots of new miners start mining (because it's cheaper to mine the coins than it is to buy them) then the difficulty will rise, and it will be less profitable to mine.
So really, to profit from mining, you just have to have a competitive advantage versus the other miners on the network. If you're just a hobbyist miner (investing a few thousand dollars and mining in your home or garage) you probably will not be that competitive, and your electricity costs will be more than the value of the coins you mine. If you are able to get ASIC hardware easily or cheaply, or have access to very cheap electricity, you might be able to profit from mining. But in most cases, for individual investors and speculators, simply buying the coins directly will actually get you more bang for your buck.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:51:26
It is indeed being deliberately "manipulated" downward. I am surprised I had to scroll so far down to find the correct answer.
The top comments in this thread suggest it is merchant adoption, or a growing disillusionment which resulted from a thus-far unmanifested summer bubble, or simply miners selling their newly-mined coins. All of which would manifest in organic, steady(ish) drops.
Instead, we've been seeing very precise, very coordinated-looking large all-at-once dumps timed for when the market seems to start to recover. If you watch some charts for a while, you will be able to tell what "natural" market movement feels like, and what "whale movement" feels like. This is the latter. When you see 1000+ coins dumped in a 3-minute interval in an otherwise-steady or even gradually-ascending context, it means some deep-pocketed entity wants the price lower and is doing what they can to achieve that goal. 
I understand the desire to hold back from attributing market movements to malicious entities; it is a conspiratorial hypothesis. But the data is not organic; each fall is being intentionally triggered with big fat out-of-nowhere sells. This is what the data is showing, plain as day. Fit the model to the data.
Now, the natural next question is: why? What is the endgame? Personally I hope and believe it is a grand poop n scoop; that is, it represents rich people working to get the coins as cheap as possible to be able to acquire as large of a stake as possible, before allowing or even forcing the price upwards (using similar-but-opposite tactics to what we've seen this past week)... but other, less optimistic possibilities are equally strong contenders.

Interesting link, appreciate it.
I'm not sure what you mean by "underrated", but it is certainly the aspect of Bitcoin that I personally know the least about. If you have any insights or musings to share about it, I'd definitely be interested in hearing them, but I don't think I have much of value to offer on that front.

Note: the "nolnet" is not a public testnet. In fact, I can find no information regarding how to connect to this "nolnet", nor any mentions of it *anywhere* prior to the BU accidental-fork-attempt post-mortem.
It appears that "nolnet", if it exists at all, is a local network privately run by one or more BU devs for internal testing purposes, possibly ephemerally. Calling it a "testnet" (again, if it even exists), is a bit disingenuous.

Yes, by itself. SegWit is a blocksize increase. Period. There's no way to pretend otherwise.
Yes, only witness data can occupy the additional space. This prevents the blocksize increase from being dangerous and opening new unsavory attack vectors... which is a subject that is conspicuously avoided by the uninformed and misinformed.

This will be my last attempt at a ping (I promise!)...

Yes, decreasing the blocksize would indeed have benefits. Many smart people have discussed this and understand it. Most think 100kb is probably too low, though, and would represent an undesirable trade-off because the cons would outweigh the pros... but decreasing the limit (especially as a soft cap) is an entirely reasonable suggestion for a number of reasons. I believe you're under the impression that you've just demonstrated the absurdity of a particular counterargument, but it's actually not absurd at all. What gave you the impression that it was?
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:23:12
Are there any criticisms against SegWit that actually make sense and survive five seconds of intelligent scrutiny? Or are those obviously bunk ones you listed here everything?
There are no actual criticisms against SegWit, it seems. You even admit this here, because you're not actually arguing any of these points (which we both know are nonsense). Isn't that right?
By the way, a lack of response will be interpreted as implicit agreement here, since you've taken such care to distance yourself from these arguments.
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:03:58
Finally, in contrast to these proposals, we have Bitcoin Core's Segregated Witness and the [Capacity Roadmap]( If you'll review the Roadmap (which I believe is *well worth* a genuine, open-minded read-through), you may note that every progress proposal included on there (with one exception, noted below) has been built, tested, and delivered. This has amounted to one long list of developmental achievements.
However, it's important to note that *this Roadmap indicates that future blocksize increases -- which would certainly be hard-forks -- are waiting on the data and results we get from the blocksize increase of SegWit*. Having real, scientific, empirical data of how the network responds to larger blocks is *integral* to the engineering, test-based approach that Core has committed to with this Roadmap. 
For as long as SegWit remains inactive (despite its production-readiness), it is a signal that a capacity-increase is *not* actually a pressing priority. Apparently the network is operating fine (creating new all-time-highs recently, seeing exponential growth around the globe, etc) even with the 1MB limit in place as it is. If the limit were causing truly destructive effects that were demonstrably hurting Bitcoin and its growth and world takeover, we'd surely be seeing more enthusiastic support for capacity-increasing solutions like SegWit (or even one of the other proposals, which I have hopefully made clear I do not personally advocate). Once again, the doomsday outcomes described by Mike and Gavin appear to have failed to manifest, and the cautious, prudent, levelheaded approach advocated by most of the engineers who make up Core has been validated (at least in this respect).

This will be my last response, as I strongly suspect you're just here to troll. But on the off-chance that you seriously don't get it yet, I'll break it down for you, and make it as simple as I possibly can...
Here is the comment and argument which I replied to:


The entire argument is "Bitcoin started at zero value, where fiat always starts at a nonzero (even if infinitesimally small) value. Therefore Bitcoin's value growth is infinite, contrasted against a large finite value growth of fiat."
The distinction between starting at zero and starting at a very small value **is the entire foundation of the argument**, if not the argument itself. 
I have corrected this misconception, and proved the original argument erroneous. 
Hopefully you get it now.

Close, but not quite. It's not the *destination address* that is compressed, it is the *origin-relevant data* which is.


Basically, a user provides a signature template that can be used to reduce the amount of data necessary in future transactions. This, of course, means that all those future transactions using this template are directly linked to that user/key/template.
Some standard address reuse issues, like the revelation of the public key, are not actually issues under the LTCP approach. Others (like the severe loss of privacy for relevant transactions) most certainly are.

Luke-Jr never "advocated" anything, but he did *propose* a [BIP]( for increasing the blocksize at the rate of about 17.7% per year with an optional reduction in the current limit for safety purposes.

Ok, I'm going to spell this out for you, and this is the very last time I ever expend effort that you yourself should expend before leaping into the fray and making a fool out of yourself. 
This is the *very last time* I do your homework for you, Bruce.
Here is what happened:
[A security auditor identifying as Charlotte Gardner discovered a bug in Bitcoin Unlimited and privately disclosed this bug to the developers of the project.](
Roger Ver later lied by claiming that ["BU devs found a bug in the code"]( when actually they were *told about* a bug in the code by an external security researcher.
In that same post, Roger Ver also lied by saying ["1 hour later, Peter Todd sees that the BU devs found this bug... posts this exploit on twitter, and all BU nodes immediately get hacked"]( What actually happened was that [the attacks started 30 minutes before Peter Todd ever found out about (or tweeted about) the bug](
Later, when Aaron van Wirdum [tweeted about the lies that Roger Ver had told during this episode]( Roger Ver [once again lied by claiming that Aaron was "twisting the truth" and tried to modify his claim to: "BU devs certainly 'found' out about the bug before [Peter's tweet]"]( This type of lie is commonly referred to as ["moving the goalposts"]( 
Later, Roger justified his lies by saying: ["At the time I thought it was accurate, along with the hundreds of other people who up voted it to the very top of There. I did your homework for you, and laid out a *string* of lies that Roger has told in this episode.

SegWit is basically just a new upgraded type of transaction, where we separate the *witness data* (most importantly, the signature) from the rest of the transaction, and store it in a new section of the Bitcoin block.
It is vastly superior to the old-style transactions, because it has "linear serialization" and doesn't allow "transaction malleability", both of which just mean that it is much more future-friendly. We would be able to see *massive* capacity gains because of the improvements that SegWit provides.
Also, because old nodes don't actually *need* the signature data to be able to understand the effects of these transactions, SegWit is possible as a soft fork that would **increase the maximum size of blocks**. In other words, it's a way where we can fit a lot more transactions in each block, without breaking compatibility with the people who haven't upgraded yet. So it is safe and would not risk splitting the blockchain in half with a nasty network fork.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:38:32
Please, just stop with this. No one is "screaming" here, we're just observing that Roger has blatantly lied. Even Roger himself has admitted, at this point, that his earlier posts on the subject were misleading (and he offered the excuse that he was misled by the fact that the misinformation was upvoted to the top of rbtc).

Also, for what it's worth, I believe Jihan is fairly up-front about doing this, and has admitted it when questioned. He believes it's his right, which I actually *do* agree with (he is allowed to sell his products however he sees fit), though I also believe it is a threat from the perspective of Bitcoin users.
I am relatively naive when it comes to hardware (much more of a software guy), so I don't have any good answers to your question. I remember an Andreas talk where he mentioned that we are just now (past 5 months) reaching the 12-14nm limits in SHA-256d ASICs (that is to say, Bitcoin chips are finally at parity with "the big boys" in terms of ramming up against Moore's proverbial wall), and his prediction was that in the next 6-18 months this will result in a much more even distribution of mining hardware, relative to the ever-more-concentrated distribution we've been witnessing over the years. 
I hope he's right, but I also believe that one of the assumptions that he made in the course of the argument was that the manufacturers involved are pursuing direct profits (behaving rationally, in a traditional sense) which I worry might be an invalid assumption these days; it really does seem possible that Jihan Wu is more interested in something other than mere profits (e.g. he's in bed with the state and working to undermine a subversive technology). His actions have seemed suspiciously illogical in some respects, and despite a long list of PBoC interventions on the Chinese *exchange* side of things, there has been a conspicuos silence with regards to the mining industry over there.

@_date: 2017-03-05 07:16:25
Well, the way it works is that two users send their coins to a special *payment channel* address (which is called "opening a payment channel") and then can make however many transactions they want between each other as quickly as they want. Theoretically, these users could transact with each other thousands of times per second via that payment channel, without waiting for any blockchain confirmations whatsoever. Finally, when they're done and they want to move their money back to their own (individually controlled) wallets, they *close the payment channel* with a withdrawal transaction. All that ever reaches the Bitcoin blockchain are the *channel open transaction* and the *channel close transaction* (two transactions in total), even though the users transacted with each other tens/hundreds/thousands/millions of times.
In other words, the "compression ratio" can be arbitrarily high. I remember seeing some demos where thousands of transactions were being sent back and forth in seconds.
Beyond normal payment channels, though, the Lightning Network allows users to *hook all their payment channels up together into one big network*, which would mean that opening a payment channel is essentially equivalent to transferring money into your checking (spending) account.

Hey, it's not my fault that all the facts and reason are on one side of this so-called "debate", and that the other side is incapable of following the (clear and well-defined) rules of the subreddit, and in fact goes out of their way to blatantly break these rules repeatedly. 
Since you have a clear ideological bias here, let's pretend that instead of promoting a contentious and malicious alternative client that could potentially fracture the Bitcoin network, instead the rule was "No spam promoting penis pills".
If someone came into the subreddit and said "BUY DICKPILLS FROM DICKPILLS.COM" over and over, and received a ban because of it, and then made an army of sockpuppet accounts to do the same thing, would you have a problem with them being banned and their posts deleted?
I'd bet not. I'd bet you'd be fine with it.
And then if someone said "Hey it turns out that penis pills have adverse side effects and can hurt you in a lot of ways", and that comment were *not* deleted, would you have a problem with that? I'd bet not.
So what if a sockpuppet account responded "NO UR DUMB, DICKPILLS ARE THE BEST AND ARE GOOD 4 U" and that comment was removed, would you have a problem with *that*? What if they were a little more subtle about it, and said "Hey everyone, the scientists who did the study about the adverse side effects of dickpills are all being paid by the banksters and so they're all in a conspiracy together. Don't believe that nonsense about health effects. Buying dickpills could be a great idea. It might be the best idea ever. Come discuss dickpills with us in the wonderful dickpill subreddit! We're trying to determine whether dickpills are healthy or not, and we keep getting C3NS0R3D in this place!" 
Would you be okay with removing that spam? I know I would.
And then months later, after a dedicated and prolonged dickpill campaign (wherein it was discovered that dickpills have numerous horrible health effects, by all the reputable experts in the industry who unanimously agree on this point), you show up saying "Hey if discussion is allowed here, where are all the dickpill posts?"
You need to be very embarrassed, both of yourself and of the despicable "community" you represent.

* [This guy, too.](

Yes, so that means that SegWit activation would unambiguously represent a blocksize increase. 
I hope you see what I'm saying here. :)
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:56:55
Witness data is any data that doesn't have to do with "how many coins moved", "what address they moved from", and "what address they are moving to"... which is mainly "the signature data included in the transaction that authorizes the movement". So each transaction has some "base data" and some "witness data", not one or the other.
In old-style transactions (what we use right now), this data is all bundled together. What SegWit does is provide a new style of transactions where you can format them in a way that makes them cleanly-divisible, so that the witness data can be easily stripped out if it needs to be (like when delivering a block to an older node).
This means that blocks and transactions will *include* the witness data (just like they do right now). The SegWit-style transactions just have it formatted in a way that makes it easy to separate the two (and defines the txid solely on the non-witness portion, so that it's not malleable anymore).

Yes, definitely. Great strides have been made, on many fronts, and we should be very grateful for the dev efforts that went into this. That's also why I usually use 8MB as the "threshold beyond which we probably shouldn't push, without more data/research/improvements" rather than 4MB.

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:44:59


Debunked thoroughly in the first few paragraphs of [this comment](


"Satoshi's successor"? Uhhh, maybe that's what Gavin likes to *call himself*, but it's not really accurate at all. Satoshi certainly never dubbed him anything like that. 
Also, Gavin didn't step down as lead maintainer until [2014]( More blatant lying.


Literally **no Core developer has ever once said anything like this**. In fact, the [Core Capacity Roadmap]( which was [signed by many of the most active developers]( explicitly lists increasing the blocksize (and flexcap proposals) as priorities that Core wants to work on. 
You are unable to provide a *single* instance, of a *single* Core developer, *ever* saying "the block size limit should never be raised for any reason". Not one. At all.


No, not accurate in the slightest. Sidechains aren't a scaling solution. They were never intended nor marketed as such. They are an extensibility solution; a way for bitcoins to be able to do anything that any altcoin can do. They do not, in and of themselves, help with scaling.


Also grossly inaccurate. There was no consensus on increasing the blocksize via a hardfork because it was [almost unanimously opposed by every single developer in Bitcoin]( This wasn't a case of "Wladimir saying" something, this was a case of **the proposal getting totally rejected by every single engineer working on Bitcoin at the time, for a long list of reasons**, and Gavin ignoring the peer review and saying "Fine Mike and I are forking off to do this regardless; we were planning to do this months ago privately without ever even trying to get your support anyway!"


They were [**not** ignored]( they were *rejected* by the technical community. 


Before ever even beginning work on BIP101 or BitcoinXT. Don't switch around the timelines.


If DDoS attacks are able to "stop the progress" of *any* proposal, that proposal is obviously unsound. Bitcoin lives in the real world, where DDoS attacks are a fact of life. If your code can't survive DDoS attacks, it isn't ready for primetime. Period.


Finally, we have an accurate statement! Good job. We are in full agreement here (though Mike Hearn is more accurately described as the "unilateral dictator" of BitcoinXT, having explicitly said that he thinks Bitcoin *needs* a leader and that he would always have "the final say" over any proposals or code changes).


If by "censorship" you mean "heavier moderation", that's correct. 


Nope, inaccurate. The actual rule is: *Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.*
But hey, inaccurate strawman versions of things is one way to summarize history, I guess.


Total lie. Apparently *many* hours were spent, during the meeting, to clarify this point, and make sure that it was translated accurately and well-understood among all attendees. You are, again, blatantly lying in your account of history here.


That and the fact that Classic was exposed as a farce when one of the Toomim brothers (who controlled the repository) went and trolled the Bitcoin Core Slack channel on acid. Oh, and let's take note of the fact that multiple pools continued to signal Classic blocks (in *direct violation* of the Hong Kong Agreement), violating the agreement mere days after it was signed.


Inaccurate. SegWit has had [closer to 30%]( signaling for quite some time, now. But hey, fudge the numbers if that's your thing. Honesty doesn't seem to be your priority here, after all.


This is *completely* false. [SegWit is a blocksize increase]( and no data whatsoever is put "outside the block" in any way at all. Yet another blatant lie.


That's not an example of technical debt; in fact, the "new transaction formats which must be supported forever" is just another usage of P2SH, meaning this is *totally* inaccurate. What makes this lie even worse is the fact that SegWit [*reduces* technical debt](


Not true. Bitcoin.com has already tried (and failed) to fork the network, when less than 20% of hashrate was signaling support for BU. So much for the "safe hard fork scaling plan", huh?


This is all true. Good job, you mixed some truth in with the lies. Clever.


False. It, in fact, introduces a case of "divergent persistence"; the blocksize controversy would be a permanent problem in Bitcoin if BU somehow got its way.


No, it doesn't. Another lie. One of the worst properties of BU is that it has almost *no* protections whatsoever against a wide array of blocksize-based attack vectors.


False. SegWit provides an immediate scaling fix and BU does not. You have stated things exactly backwards.
Your final paragraph pretends that Core developers (of which there are hundreds, who have been working on Bitcoin development for *years* and have proven track records) are in any way comparable to the BU developers (none of whom have any track records, and who [are totally, provably, consistently incompetent]( Don't even *try* to pretend like Core are on the same level as BU, in terms of development expertise and code quality. That is a boldfaced lie.
Your whole post is full of lies. Almost every single thing you said was a lie.

@_date: 2017-03-11 19:46:32


Not necessarily, but close. Basically the "average number of transaction outputs per transaction" should be expected to decrease in a SegWit-active network.


No, it is simply a means to getting the *most* out of SegWit that we can. SegWit would be useful with or without the blockweight factor, but it would be *most* useful with it included.


That's an interesting thought. But I don't think it's realistic to expect, because the negative externalities of UTXO bloat actually affect other stakeholders *more* than they do miners. 


That's true, but also irrelevant.


As expected.


Well, that's assuming that these outputs could only be spent in isolation (rather than being able to be bundled in with other outputs in a transaction). I ask that you please take a moment to think about that aspect.

Oh, it's *much, much* worse than what that page shows. If you actually go down the list, and rule out companies run by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, there are *pretty much zero* recognizable or meaningful companies supporting BU/EC.
I'm not kidding.
Examples of pro-SegWit and ready-for-SegWit companies/organizations: Armory, BitGo, Bitsquare, BTCC, Coinbase, Coinkite, Colu, Electrum, Gemini, GreenAddress, KeepKey, Ledger, OKCoin, pycoin, Samourai Wallet, Shapeshift, Xapo, and plenty of smaller (less recognizable) organizations
Examples of pro-BU companies/organizations: Atlanta Bitcoin, Bitaps.com, BitcoinPlug, Bittoku GK, Bitzillions, CTY Bitcoin Vietnam TNHH, GoURL.io, Keyois, Keys4Coins, MrCoin, Slon BTM
The difference is night and day. Seriously, go check it out yourself, see what I mean firsthand. It's clear that every company that matters in the space and isn't under the control of Ver/Wu is on one side of this debate. Saying it's "70% vs 20%" is massively overrepresenting BU's support.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:01:19
About 90% of nodes support SegWit. The vast majority of big Bitcoin businesses (like exchanges) support SegWit. As you say, the miners are the least-supportive group right now: just about 30% of miners support SegWit.
It appears that this might largely be due to Jihan Wu. He founded (and runs) multiple mining pools, as well as Bitmain, which is the current most successful producer of competitive Bitcoin mining hardware (miners). As reported by some of the mining pools that buy their hardware from Bitmain, Jihan is currently refusing to sell his products to SegWit-supporting buyers, and demanding that his buyers signal support for BU instead. It is estimated that Bitmain is responsible for producing 70% of the network's current mining hardware, which perhaps not-so-coincidentally is the same percentage of the mining network that isn't signaling SegWit support.
In other words, we might very well be watching the effects of a hardware-manufacturing monopoly play out, right now. My money is (quite literally) on the market finding a way to punish this monopolistic aggression, but the battle is certainly not yet won.

No, blocks aren't padded with 0s and not a single block has ever been exactly 1MB in size. 
Blocks can be any size, as long as it is 1MB or smaller. A block with very few transactions will typically be very small, and take up less disk space and propagate a little quicker.
The real problem with flexcap blocks ("elastic blocks" as you called them) is that they would allow clever miners to "attack" by filling up blocks to sizes larger than the rest of the network can handle, for a bigger competitive advantage and more individual profits. They could even do this by filling them with transactions that they themselves make.

Nah, plenty of us support a real max blocksize increase and aren't "paid actors". In a way, there are *some* paid actors supporting one, too: just about 30% of the miners are signaling support of SegWit, which does exactly that.

@_date: 2017-03-01 22:32:33
You realize that the *only* people who apparently do not want a blocksize increase are the miners, right? Core already coded and tested and released a blocksize increase to a 4MB weight limit. More than half of miners aren't signaling readiness for it (or any other on-chain capacity solutions or approaches).
You're pretending like Core (or any of us) are arguing against a blocksize increase, but it's just the miners who don't seem to want one. Argue against them.

Basically, if you have pruning enabled, once your node has downloaded the block data and validated the blocks/transactions in it, it throws away the old data that it no longer needs (since it's already been validated).
This saves your disk space from having to hold the entire blockchain, which takes up a lot of space. The downside is that other nodes won't be able to download this data from your node (which, from your perspective, isn't really much of a downside) and if something goes wrong, you could hypothetically wind up in a position where you have to re-download that old data to validate it again.
To your second question: you would have to download the data to validate it, yes. But if pruning is enabled, your node can throw this data away as it goes.
@_date: 2017-03-02 06:01:32
Here's the relevant tradeoff:


Basically, a user provides a signature template that can be used to reduce the amount of data necessary in future transactions. This, of course, means that all those future transactions using this template are directly linked to that user/key/template.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:24:11
By that definition, a blocksize increase is impossible. Literally *nothing* could ever be a blocksize increase for non upgraded nodes, **by definition**.
Think about it.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:03:41
It provides a means of limiting chain growth to sustainable rates and a mechanism by which full nodes can enforce this.
So yes, it protects against malicious miners like you say. It also protects against tragedies of the commons; well-meaning miners behaving rationally will include as many fee-paying transactions as possible, even if the externalities of these transactions might marginally harm Bitcoin's decentralizability by increasing the cost of full validation at a larger factor than the economic utility of said transactions legitimately warrants. It also provides a "sanity" filter; the quadratically-scaling sighash design  could have really hurt us by now, for instance, without a hard cap in place.
More abstractly, it also serves as a nice driver of layered-growth; so far, the "Bitcoin stack" has been pretty much one base layer and then centralized proprietary services on top, mainly because that's cheap and easy to do. But we've always known we can do better, with primitives like payment channels, sig aggregation, and more recently zero-knowledge proofs. There is little reason to pursue such (superior) solutions without an economic impetus, though, which the block cap handily provides.
There are other worthwhile considerations and benefits of the cap; it's not clear how many Satoshi foresaw or understood when he put it in place, but he certainly thought such a limit was valuable in some ways.

@_date: 2017-03-12 09:08:56
1) Yes. I am assuming by "server" you mean a continually-well-connected machine that is generally managed via shell access (rather than via a windowing system).
2) Regardless of whether you run bitcoind or bitcoin-qt, the blockchain data will load from the [data directory]( and if you want to, you can specify what directory this is via the -datadir flag on the command line when you run the software:
    bitcoind -datadir=PATH
Note: if you run it this way, the commands you run via bitcoin-cli will *also* need this flag set in order to work properly in many cases.
This directory can also be copied or moved around (see the ["Transferability" section]( from the same page above).
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:18:44
Sure, but I'm not sure how any of that relates to the point I'm making...
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:25:01
You specify how much space the blocks will take up with -prune=N ... N is how much space (in MiB) the block files can take up on your hard drive. The minimum value is 550 (roughly half a gigabyte). 
In other words, it's up to you. If you wanted to allocate 10GB of your hard drive to Bitcoin, for instance, you could use -prune=9540.

Oh, interesting, what money was raised and for what layer-2 solution? I'm very interested to learn more about this, considering Blockstream raised all their funding well before they deployed resources to develop Lightning Network solutions, so that can't be what you're referring to, and sidechains are an extensibility solution (rather than a scaling solution), so that can't be what you're referring to, either.


What is "their product" in this context? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:52:56
Bruce, I respect you (despite what it might look like here). I apologize for being so confrontational.
If you are genuinely interested in hearing the arguments against a hard-fork blocksize increase right now in Bitcoin, I actually spent a lot of time typing up a decently-long wall-of-text on reddit a few days ago. 
It might be overwhelming (and annoying, since the comments are all jumbled from the odd upvote here and there, but I numbered them for this reason)... but I think it is a good "launching pad" for a serious discussion. I don't know if you'll have the time to digest any of this or have a lengthy discussion with me, but on the off-chance that you do... [here is a loooooong series of comments I made on the subject]( I would appreciate it (if you do have the time) to approach these with as open of a mind as you are capable of.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:52:29
Yeah, Vitalik embarrassed himself with that tweet. He (apparently) didn't even understand the UASF proposal on a basic level.
Then again, he's been deliberately trying to shit-talk Bitcoin (just like all his pals in rbtc) for years now. He's not offering rational well-thought-out insight on such subjects, he's just looking for an opportunity to talk trash.

You're greatly misunderstanding the findings presented in the paper. Get back to me once you've read it and grasped the conclusions; until then, there's very little use in trying to have a productive conversation on the subject.

It provides opt-in benefits. This is a good thing. Sustaining legacy support is also a good thing. No downside here.


No it doesn't. It actually reduces technical debt. Also, P2SH already exists.


Actually, as a soft fork it *categorically* induces far less risk than a hard fork would. No replay protections or chain-split risks are incurred. The biggest advantage of a soft fork over a hard fork is that we would incur far, far less risk this way.


Everyone is well aware that hard forks would respect the witness data, and/or the discount would be simultaneously reduced to accommodate a base blocksize increase. This was literally mentioned on the day SegWit was announced, i.e. what silly nonsense you're spouting.


That's the beauty of it. By making one small, elegant change, we get a giant list of benefits. We kill ten birds with one stone! And no, we don't need ten stones to do this. SegWit does one thing, and the effects of doing this one thing are manifold.


The alternative, as we all know, is to have the same thing without the cryptographic protections. Like what we have today (with Coinbase et al). Lightning Network would be an unambiguous improvement over this status quo.


A lot of people deny the Holocaust ever happened. We should not listen to people who are incapable of making logical arguments, no matter how nasty their accusations are.
So, the bottom line is that there are **no actual valid arguments against SegWit**. But you already know that, which is why you have repeatedly emphasized that *you* don't believe any of those bunk arguments.
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:56:56
Nope, not sure how you could even have gotten that impression, to be honest! Care to explain yourself?
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:01:18
This is a common suggestion, actually.
There are a few things that you may not have thought about, though...
1) Many members of Core (and the rest of the community) are opposed to a politically-motivated hard-fork of any kind. That's exactly what you're suggesting here, so it's immediately contentious.
2) A hard-fork blocksize increase (and in particular a contentious one) would have to have a lot of "safety" code included (not to mention tested). This would take many months to produce and vet (perhaps over a year). 
3) SegWit *is* a blocksize increase, as well as a compromise. If that's what is wanted, then SegWit represents exactly that.
4) Asking for "a compromise" that involves a hard-fork isn't really asking for a compromise, at all. I know this isn't something you will like to hear, but that's the reality of the situation.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:54:04

My main criticism of the spec (which is the same criticism that most engineers have when it's brought up) is that there isn't actually one. Zander said "I don't need a spec, there's reference code in the Classic repo if you want a spec!" (apparently not appreciating the irony of this statement).
My criticisms of the code itself are more specific and numerous, but I am not in the business of giving concrete advice to people who are actively attacking my investments. I know of a BU exploit that has not been patched yet, for instance, that I am by no means going to publicize until I feel I can maximize damage to the project in the process of doing so.
Go ahead and hate me for this behavior, if you want, but understand that *this* is what makes Bitcoin antifragile; those of us who support it will do what we can to defend it against hostile attackers. You cannot force me to give you my hard-earned insights.

Quit with the "define X" nonsense. It regresses infinitely. A dictionary is an entirely circular piece of work.
The value proposition is outlined in the abstract of Satoshi's whitepaper. In decentralizing the control of a monetary  protocol we can derive certain benefits over centralized alternatives. They are too many for me to list here.

That article talks about "ciphera" which is not a pseudonym for any Core developer. It also concerns *future* exploits, not the exploits that have already been executed.

May I ask why we want this? Isn't the ability to signal the rejection of a protocol replacement a *crucial* right for Bitcoin users? It sounds like you are advocating pure majority rule, where any minority (even a hypothetical 49%) have no meaningful vote at all. 
The protocol that currently exists is the one that we all agreed to, the one that is understood to be Bitcoin. This includes the 21M coin cap limit, the halving reward schedule, and it includes an unforgiving size cap of 1MB per block of transactions. If you are okay with an infinitesimal hash-rate majority being able to force a mandatory consensus protocol adjustment on all other stakeholders, it has profound implications. I, personally, would not want a majority hash-rate controller to be able to dictate consensus and validity parameters. One of the most compelling points made in the whitepaper, to me, was the bit about how even an attacker/coalition with a majority hashrate "does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker", and how nodes can always respect the original (honest) consensus validity rules to effectively thwart enormous categories of attacks (rendering them cost-prohibitive to rational or greedy attackers). This stuff is critical to what Bitcoin *is*, and many of us still believe in this stuff. 
Your argument seems to be that as long as you can get a slight numerical *edge* on those who disagree with a protocol overhaul, you should be able to override their objections (and even worse, you would want to make sure that they have no "hope of survival" afterwards). This is an inherently violent perspective, I hope you realize. It is a "tyranny of the majority" dystopia. Even worse, this wouldn't even require a majority of *different stakeholders*, but rather a majority in terms of a specific form of investment (via mining hardware and electricity costs, rather than other forms of capital). No other economic actors are granted any voice in this tyrannical "democracy"; it is the (predominantly Chinese) mining pool operators and hardware manufacturers who enjoy an unchallenged monopoly on voting power.
Right now, there is only so much that a mining coalition can achieve. Some of us aren't comfortable with a new protocol where this is relaxed significantly. They (we?) would prefer to see such experiments performed on *altcoins*, where our preexisting investments are not put at risk on the whims of a few businessmen.


Wow, really good point. I hadn't thought about that.
That's actually a *really* good point. That was a 6-month window, which apparently was seen as sufficient at the time. Furthermore, since node count has actually *decreased* since around that time, it should be (hypothetically) similarly possible to get by on a similar time-window these days. The only crucial distinction, therefore, is the actual contentiousness of the change in question. In the &lt;0.8 vs &gt;0.8 situation, there was an actual bug in the former implementation, which could (even accidentally) lead to chain-splits. Upgrading to fix such a vulnerability/issue is a bit different than doing so to make a controversial derestriction of consensus parameters. 
However, I do see that you would consider the 1MB limit as "a bug" of sorts, so this whole aspect of things is really interesting. You've given me a lot to think about. Thank you.


Yeah, you know what, having thought about it a lot this past day, I see where you're coming from on this, too. The *only* issue with this suggestion is that it disregards the "data-driven development" plan altogether. In a way, we've seen *some* data already, but it is generally *worrying* data, and the trends don't look pretty from a decentralist's perspective. Many long-time contributors *truly feel* that allowing significantly larger blocks on the network would worsen these trends, and would rather have some data to inform the decisions on how exactly to solve the "blocksize problem" in a long-term sense. 
I do see what you're saying, and personally, I would love to see a candidate hard-fork (preferably including some wishlist items, and maybe incorporating an extensible tx format like FlexTrans) start getting built and earnestly peer-reviewed by the engineers at Core. Unfortunately, most of the people who are most passionately interested in writing hard-fork code don't seem interested in cooperatively participating with Bitcoin Core... which, to me, seems to indicate political intent (rather than technical). But I digress. This comment has become too long anyway.
Again, thanks for the interesting insight on this, though.

Have you never heard the phrase "caught with your pants down" before, or are you simply trying to be clever here by pretending like there is a sexual nature to what I said?
I showed up to this thread and merely pointed out that **miners** are currently the only entities in Bitcoin who seem (presently) unenthusiastic about a blocksize increase, which is obvious and empirically proven by how many of them are not attempting to upgrade to blocksize-increasing mining software or signal support for such.
*Nothing* about my comment was hostile or rude in the slightest. There was no offense intended, nor did I express myself in a confrontational manner. 
Then *you* responded with an overt dismissal, ignoring the fact that I politely pointing out, and finishing your comment thusly:


In other words, **you began the hostility**. I had done nothing to provoke said hostility, but rather than responding civilly and addressing my point head on, you resorted to a weird passive aggressive ad hominem attempt and didn't bother to acknowledge my (totally valid) point.
Now you've doubled down with the ad hominems, as if it's not totally transparent that you are trying to avoid discussing things rationally, and you're desperately trying to make it seem like *I'm* the one with a nasty attitude.
I will grant that I'm frustrated with all the trolling and deception I see in the Bitcoin subreddits these days, and I have a distinct lack of patience for trolls like yourself who are not here to have real productive conversations, but only want to stir shit up and make a fuss and further divide the community. I am not in the habit of showing mercy when someone demonstrates a propensity towards the propagation of violent ignorance and hate, and I am not in the habit of letting fallacious arguments go unrebutted. You, apparently, have taken great offense to your own fallacious arguments' destruction, and are surely upset at this point, which explains all the weird sexual stuff and ad hominems.
Hey, you don't want to have a real discussion, and aren't capable of keeping it civil, and you prefer the passive aggressive approach (as do most cowards). That's fine. Just don't try to pretend like I started the hostility here, because it's obvious to both of us that this is a lie.

You haven't read the Core Capacity Roadmap yet, huh? It's definitely well worth a read! [Check it out when you have a chance.](
Data-driven development is a tricky concept for non-engineers to wrap their minds around. Basically, most of the Core engineers are opposed to a hard fork blocksize increase (*especially* a politically motivated one, and *especially especially* a controversial one); such a proposal is going to be a controversial and politically motivated proposal, by definition.
Now, if we increase the blocksize a moderate (but significant) amount via a nice, safe, well-tested *soft fork*, and then observe what sort of effects such an increase has on the network (and centralization thereof), then suddenly we have something to base hard fork proposal code and reasoning off of. Suddenly the controversy melts away and we can speak in concrete terms about what risks and benefits there are with further increases. 
That's what the Capacity Roadmap outlines. Seriously, go read it; it's worth the effort.

The seller realizes a $10 opportunity cost for not holding longer, sure. But they do not **lose $10**, which would be something else entirely.
If you buy a bitcoin for $100, wait until it can be sold for $200, and then sell it to me, and then the price goes to $210... you gained $100 and I have gained $10. My $10 gain does not mean that you gained $90 instead of $100, even though you would have gained more by holding your coin a little longer.
If your question is about "Where does the wealth come from, if not one of our pockets?" then the answer is basically "We have realized more gains from trade by using a more efficient monetary technology." Just as society was made wealthier as a whole by transitioning from seashells and bones to gold to fiat and credit, it can be made wealthier as a whole by transitioning to a cryptocurrency paradigm.

The BU developers aren't competent enough to merge in the SegWit changes, and have made too many changes of their own (and fallen too far behind Core in the process) to be able to make any clean merges. I don't mean this as an insult, they simply don't have the developer firepower. If you watch their activity on GitHub and check out their code review process, this becomes very obvious, very quickly.
Furthermore, they have (on many separate occasions) said that they do not support SegWit and have no intentions of including it into their code, even if it gets activated.


No. The majority of Core developers have voiced *many* concerns about the stability, wisdom, or safety of the BU "emergent consensus" principle, and have staunchly opposed it on the grounds of how dangerous and detrimental of a change it represents. Many have also stated (again, on numerous separate occasions) the understanding that BU is an altcoin (even if it did manage to activate on mainnet with a majority of hashrate) because it is a complete protocol replacement. You might philosophically disagree with this categorization, but it is a valid perspective, like it or not, and many of the most industrious Core developers (who are responsible for the majority of the code in both BU and Core, and without whom it is almost a certainty that eventually catastrophic network issues will arise) firmly hold this perspective.
Some developers will probably be willing to go work on BU, but many of them have expressed an unwillingness to do so (and with good reasons).
You should spend more time following the primary developer communication channels (Reddit is *not* really one of these). A lot of this stuff has been discussed at length.

* [This guy, too.](
* [And here's a section where thezerg1 (Andrew Stone; lead developer of BU) totally dismisses the attack vector with flippant jokes.](

It's not academic papers that I am referencing, it's developer input through developer channels. I can spend a little bit of time compiling together a few links showing the kind of peer review that I mean here, but the bulk of it is going to be from Core developers (i.e. the only experienced Bitcoin developers there are), and if you're just going to dismiss the review because it came from people who participate in Core development, I'd rather not expend the effort.


I am referencing the Bitcoin.com incident, but it does appear that you misunderstood what happened.
What actually happened was the lead developer of BU (Andrew Stone) made a change to his local codebase which included an arithmetical error (he forgot that 0.99 + 0.035 is more than 1, basically). He committed this change *directly to master*, on v1.0 of the BU code, without anyone else on the BU team having reviewed the change he made to check for bugs.
I am going to assume that you're not a software developer (and I apologize if this is a mistaken assumption). Committing directly to a master branch of a project of any significant size or complexity is *incredibly* unprofessional practice, and demonstrates a level of amateur development that is, quite frankly, absolutely astounding. It should be clear *why*: bugs inevitably slip through when you do this. Pretty much every professional software developer who collaborates with others via a version tracking tool or platform like git/GitHub knows this, and understands that the best practice is to make a change locally to a personal/feature branch, submit a Pull Request for the change in question, and have another developer (or multiple) review it and okay it before merging it in themselves.
Basically, the fact that a process like this wasn't followed speaks *volumes* about the competence and organization of the developers at BU.
Anyway, this bug made it in to v1.0 of BU. When Roger Ver updated his BU miners to run this version a few hours later, his miners accidentally mined a block larger than 1MB. *Not* because he used incorrect user settings, but because Andrew Stone merged a simple arithmetical bug directly into the master branch of the code.
The quickest way to "fix" this bug was to *decrease* the size of blocks that your miner is trying to mine (changing it from "1 MB max" to "0.95 MB max") so that the overlooked arithmetical bug wouldn't accidentally create blocks larger than 1MB when you didn't mean to. Later, the devs were able to actually fix the issue in the code (it was a very, very simple fix, after all). 
One more fun bit of information: if the developers had ever tried running the simple, basic tests that come bundled with Bitcoin's code, this issue would have immediately been flagged. The fact that the bug was only caught once it actually cost miners real money basically told the world "BU devs aren't even running basic tests on their code before they promote it to master"... it is disappointing, to put it lightly.


Oh, please don't read too much into the analogy. All I was trying to say was that "it's just a simple change of a number" is a really bad way to tell if a change is safe or not. You have to instead consider the actual context and implications of changing that number, to determine if it's safe. You can't just say "it was a 1, so making it a 2 instead is certainly safe!" because oftentimes, especially when it comes to math or engineering, making a tiny numerical change can have dramatic effects on the end result.


Yes, but if you re-read what I wrote, you'll notice that the BU devs *weren't even paying attention to the testnet*. They didn't notice the fork until over a month later, when a Core dev pointed it out to them. 
And yes, they shut it down afterwards. A great shame, if you ask me. And again, it doesn't inspire confidence in the developers of BU (or Classic).


BU proponents have generally been trying to hush it up. 
[Here's a thread where it was brought up, and you can see Andrew Stone trying to downplay it as if it wasn't a big deal at all.]( Didn't stop them from shutting the testnet down, though.


Funny that you should mention that, because it's actually *another* example of BU proponents demonstrating incompetence, believe it or not. 
What happened was Codeshark was running an older version of SegWit and got confused when what he was seeing on the disposable SegWit-specific segnet didn't match what he was seeing locally. [Gregory Maxwell summarized this aptly.](
What followed was a ruckus from many people in rbtc about how "SegWit forked the testnet!" without anyone bothering to check the facts of the matter. Later, it came to light what actually happened, and now the only remnants of the affair is the continued confusion by people like yourself who try to do research on the subject and wind up accidentally reading nonsense rbtc threads chock full of ignorance and hate.
Really, really embarrassing affair for that entire subreddit. Can you imagine what it must have felt like, to try and make fun of Core for an accidental testnet fork, when no such thing happened... *while your code actually did fork your testnet*? Incredibly, incredibly embarrassing, if you ask me.


Unfortunately, this is an illusion, and you've been fooled once again. The BU developers have no intention of peaceful cooperation of any sort. In [a recent interview]( a BU developer was asked "If Core incorporated every single change from BU and met every single demand that you have made, would you be willing to support such code?" and the answer was a firm **no**. It is not about the code; BU developers want control, and they are orchestrating a political attack against Core, and nothing else. 
The code itself is incredibly buggy and trivially gameable in well-known ways. BU is not about code. It never was.

Luke-Jr released a hard fork BIP a while ago. No one has the authority to merge a controversial BIP into the Core codebase... it sounds like you think Bitcoin is a centralized project with an authoritative leader, but that's not the case. Bitcoin Core is a decentralized organization without any leaders who have authority to merge code in that doesn't have widespread agreement.
Also, the miners promised not to run any code that was not compatible with Core **in the meantime**, before SegWit was ever released. They violated that clause of the agreement. Period. End of story. You can't spin that, it's just a fact.

I looked into your account history more closely, and you're right, you don't look quite so much like a hostile sockpuppet account on second glance. Sorry for the hasty conclusion.
And you're right, not all new accounts are shills/socks. I wrote a list of solid indicators that can be used to detect actual sockpuppets a little lower in this thread, in fact, and the only checkbox that you seem to hit is the "fresh account" one, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here and apologize.
For the record, the big reason why you seemed like a sockpuppet at first glance (other than your account age) was the claim you made that "the people disagreeing with you do make decent arguments", because in this thread (so far) the only decent arguments have all come from me. Still not sure what you could have been referring to, but it's no big deal. The bigger point here was to get on record, so that I can link back to this thread as further evidence comes to light proving my correctness (as it always seems to do). My batting average on Bitcoin predictions is something like .985 since early 2013, and more often than not, people disagree with what I say at first, and then I'm proven right days/weeks/months later and I get the unparalleled pleasure of watching the haters delete their accounts and/or frantically backpedaling on their arguments.

@_date: 2017-03-08 02:24:51
Soft forks *are* safer than hard forks, that is definitionally true.
And no, no Core developers have said that we should "never" hard fork. In fact, if you read the Core Capacity Roadmap, it clearly explains that the plan is to hard fork *after SegWit has activated*, once we have some data on how the network responds to larger blocks.
Also, Core developers have *already* proposed hard fork code, and within the 3 month timeline after SegWit was finished and merged in. None of these proposals have gained widespread support, and they pretty much necessarily have to be conservative (because, again, *we are waiting on data from SegWit* to inform our hard fork decisions moving forward), but the proposals were made and the code written.
You don't appear to have a great affinity for facts and truth, though. Oh well.

Since BTU is basically "majority hashrate dictates consensus rules" when you boil it down, it's unclear whether it would include halvings in the long term. The Chief Scientist of BU actually thinks that Bitcoin might need perpetual inflation in order to work (which means that at some point in the next 10-15 years, we need to stop experiencing halvings) but some BTU supporters disagree with this, and think that miners will keep performing halvings.
Interestingly, it's been shown that either Bitcoin needs to have perpetual inflation (stop going through halvings) or a perpetual transaction backlog (demand for block space regularly exceeds supply of block space). Since BTU is based around not having the latter, logically, at some point BTU stops working if the halvings continue. Many will deny this, but they typically haven't actually read the papers on the subject, so their input should be taken with a grain of salt.
In the end, you have to ask: if the miners have full control of the system, do you think they'll always be happy to accept their mining rewards getting cut in half every four years? I'd bet not. With Bitcoin (Core), they don't have control of this stuff, because there is more to consensus than just "majority hashrate gets to dictate consensus", but with BTU, it's different.
You'll have to form your own judgment on the matter. There are no black and white answers.

Normally your comments have more substance to them, though. I was disappointed when I saw these exchanges because I was expecting more (my impression has always been that you're a smart and reasonable fellow). I guess I understand the hesitance to get too involved when things are already too hostile... but still.
As for "compromise is the only way forward", there's a couple of ways to look at it. Arguably, "the way forward" could simply be "not touching the blocksize at all", and maintaining the status quo on that front. Bitcoin seems to be prospering with the limit in place as it is, after all. 
Personally, I would prefer more capacity, but I'm not convinced that leaving the limit in place is the end of Bitcoin or anything like that. I think we'll most likely see the blocksize increase, one way or another, and probably this year... but I'm not so sure that we *need* it to.
And finally, have you thought about the fact that SegWit *is* a compromise? Many people are concerned with any blocksize increase at all, and the detrimental effects it might have on many fronts... but almost all of these people decided to support a particular blocksize increase, anyway, because it lays the foundations for more substantive capacity improvements and because it would allow us to safely gauge the effects of a modest lifting of the cap without incurring a lot of the nastiest risks that would typically accompany such a lift. SegWit always was a compromise, granting each side a little of what they were asking for and providing a place in the middle where common ground and understanding could be had.
But it doesn't seem like a compromise is really what one side wanted, after all. I got to watch firsthand as propaganda machines were spun up and misinformation was blasted out violently for months on end... and now we have people who genuinely believe SegWit *somehow compresses transactions rather than increasing the allowed size of blocks*, despite the code being publicly auditable and this being trivially debunkable with 5 minutes of research. We have people continually arguing that hard forks are "cleaner" and/or "safer" than soft forks, despite how obviously untrue this is if you merely know the definitions of the terms. People have been regularly repeating myths like "SegWit increases technical debt" when it does the exact opposite in a number of ways.
I see an absolutely jawdropping level of ignorance coming from one faction, and overwhelming frustration (and yes, a lack of patience and an overt hostility at this point) from the other. Attempts at compromise have been made, but one side seems unwilling to compromise *at all*. Developers on that side (honestly more accurately they might be called pseudo-developers, but that's another story) have actually said *even if Core implements the exact changes that are in BU, they would fight tooth and nail to make sure Core's software wasn't used anymore.* How can you compromise with a faction like that? How can you offer them anything, when they have outright admitted that *even if you give them 100% of what they want and remove everything that you do, they will STILL oppose you*?
Please take a moment to think about what I'm saying. It is a big deal, and it seems to go unappreciated by a lot of otherwise-very-clever folks.

The 1MB limit, according to Satoshi, has absolutely nothing to do with spam protection.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:47:17
Many months after the blocksize limit was put in place, Satoshi explicitly said:


The "dust spam limit" in question is a node-specific relay policy being discussed in the linked thread.
Satoshi described it as "a first try" at addressing the spam problem. This, of course, 100% precludes the blocksize being an attempt to do the same.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:18:52
It more than doubles it. But beyond that, it lays the foundation for even better capacity improvements. Schnorr signatures (which can reduce transaction sizes by 40%) are possible once SegWit is active, which basically amounts to *another* doubling of capacity. And then Lightning Network will be operational as soon as SegWit is activated, which can yield massive massive gains in the capacity department.
And also, once SegWit is active, we will have data on how the network responds to a modest blocksize increase... which is what the Core engineers are waiting on before they code up (or propose) further blocksize hard-forks (including flexcap proposals).

The 1MB limit protects against *many* things. It is a very beneficial parameter to have; it is very fortunate that Satoshi managed to merge it in to the codebase when he did. Thank goodness it slipped under the radar (relatively speaking) and that those people who *did* notice it respected Satoshi's wishes to keep it quiet until the majority of the network had upgraded to enforce it, locking it in solidly.
I appreciate that you have been gracious enough to acknowledge my point here; truly, you've earned my respect in the process. I understand that the 1MB limit is a great source of controversy these days, but it is also (in my opinion) very worthwhile to take some time to seriously consider and entertain the perspective that this limit is a *good* thing, *helping* Bitcoin in many ways, even today.

Rootstock is not only leveraging Bitcoin's network effect as a sidechain, but apparently more efficient and cost-effective than Ethereum. Oh, and it's also not completely centralized like Ethereum is.
You're still thinking in terms of "pump and dump", but that doesn't work with sidechains. They simply extend Bitcoin, and grant it all the powers of an altcoin. They don't represent distinct investment opportunities; they just improve Bitcoin's.

Nope, it's Bitcoin.
Rootstock isn't "needed" at all, though it does provide a nice proof-of-concept sidechain that allows any Ethereum dApps (if any ever actually manage to work out, haha) to be trivially ported to Bitcoin without any significant developer effort.

The value of a bitcoin actually doesn't matter, for the purposes of the paper. It could be $0.10 or it could be $10,000,000 apiece. Even if the price keeps doubling every four years, that wouldn't affect the conclusions of the paper, because the argument is not about the price of bitcoin as denominated in *dollars*, it's about the value of the block rewards *relative to the fees*.
For this same reason, it's not a "123 year" time horizon that we are interested in; it's a 10-15 year time horizon. Basically, by the year 2032 or so, this phenomenon will have "had its say" on the fate of Bitcoin, one way or another. 
I think [this]( is a much friendlier breakdown of the same idea, though it's not in whitepaper-format.

What "scaling issues"? Bitcoin is not having any issues at this time. It *has* to develop a fee market (and a continually-present backlog of transactions in the mempool) over the next decade for the system to work at all. This has been understood since the very beginning. If the "issues" that you refer to are in regards to the mempool or rising fees, then **they are not issues at all**, they are just signs that Bitcoin is working and growing as designed.
If the "issues" that you mean are that people in the community disagree about how to alter the network's consensus settings, then I am happy to inform you that this is not a problem either! It is a good thing, actually.
Bitcoin's value proposition *relies* on such gridlock. If it were easy to mutate (like centralized coins such as Ethereum are), then the ultimate token finitude would not be "guaranteed" (or as close to it as possible) and the whole thing would be doomed over the long term.
Consensus alterations are not *supposed* to be easy to perform. If any given proposal is non-negligibly contentious, the default action *has* to be "maintain status quo" because underneath it all, this is where the token value derives from.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:34:48

Yes, this was always the case. Peter Rizun's models almost always assume perpetual inflation, in fact.
In the absence of a continual backlog (which is only possible if demand for block space regularly exceeds supply, i.e. the exact opposite of what BU tries to guarantee), Bitcoin *needs* perpetual inflation in order to survive over the medium or long term. 
BU is economically incompatible with a finite (21M) coin cap.

I think this is too short of a lead-time, and doesn't include any provisions to address the critical second half of the original UASF proposal: **non-miner industry-wide commitment to the softfork-enabled chain**.
Without that commitment (or at least a plausibly-outlined means of securing it), I think a flag-day-activated UASF is an extremely reckless and unwise proposal. There is simply too much potential for harm.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:20:13


It's not. SegWit is well-vetted and well-tested, has been through extensive peer review, and has been demonstrated to be safe with over than a year's worth of testnet experimentation.
BU, on the other hand, *forked the only testnet it was ever tested on in half*, and none of the developers even noticed for a month, until a Core developer noticed the chain-split and pointed it out to them. They shut down the testnet shortly afterwards out of embarrassment.
BU has not been well-tested nor well-vetted. What little open peer review it has received has been *overwhelmingly* negative; it is riddled with known (and almost certainly unknown) vulnerabilities that the maintainers ignore and dismiss. It is bad code written by incompetent developers, and has already cost people money on mainnet *even before being intentionally activated*.


Then you haven't read much. Check out [this post]( for a quick glance into the subject, if you want to learn more.


If a car bumps into you going 1 MPH, it doesn't hurt that much, and you will not be seriously injured. If we simply replace that "1" with a "40", which is "just a different number", then the impact will be fatal. 


We have done this with SegWit with years' worth of testnets. They *tried* to do it with BU but like I said, it forked the testnet in half and had to be shut down. And that wasn't even with people *trying* to break it, that was just a natural result of running the buggy (poorly reviewed) code that BU represents.


Yes, that's exactly right. One side is unwilling to work with the other.


They already have. That's what SegWit represents.


You should be petitioning mining pools to signal for SegWit activation, in that case.


We have. It's called SegWit.


I don't blame "every single person with a different perspective" but I do blame those who are completely unwilling to acknowledge the points raised by those they disagree with. Right now, everyone in support of SegWit has acknowledged that bigger blocks will help with Bitcoin capacity, which is why SegWit includes a blocksize increase (among other capacity-improving benefits and foundations). The alternative approach to increasing the blocksize (with a hard fork) has many risks and downsides, and many people adamantly refuse to acknowledge these. They are obstacles of progress, whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:35:11
It isn't. That's a myth.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:01:36
You raise a good point; a federated peg certainly isn't perfect. But again, a contract written for the EVM will work, as-is, on RSK. That's an important point; switching costs basically *do not exist*.
Now, I understand the counterargument that "Some switching costs are social; once people are using the Eth-based platforms, that adds value to those platforms, even if the code can run elsewhere just as well (or in this case better)"... and that is true. The question is: what dApps actually represent anything more than just pie-in-the-sky ideas? I have gone through the list of up-and-coming dApps and was *extremely* unimpressed with what I saw. Almost without exception, there seems to be a total lack of substantive understanding of what values decentralization confers. The tricky part to almost any smart contract is not the code itself, but the *oracle* that ties the code to the real world, and other than (*perhaps*) one or two prediction market approaches (which really just shifts the problem to one of meaningful liquidity... and that's just an argument for Bitcoin in the end), there don't seem to be any real breakthroughs on this front.
I don't need the whole "but this is the future" pitch; trust me, I have my eye on the space, and have reached these conclusions after much serious contemplation. You're free to reach different conclusions than those that I did, too. You might even be right. But from where I'm standing, that's the lay of the land.

Not to mention that it also includes a safe but significant blocksize increase itself?
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:18:10
Perhaps... but many people do legitimately believe that saying "Bitcoin goes through perpetual bubble cycles" is something only a hater (i.e. Buttcoiner) would say. And in all fairness and their defense, "bubble" generally does have a very negative connotation in the world of finance.
That the bubble cycle in Bitcoin is a bullish phenomenon is actually very ironic. 
Also, I'm not so sure that there was a *whoosh* moment right there (though I admit it does seem possible, in which case lol shit). Check the user history. Seems genuine to me.

Well, yeah, because BTU isn't active. This same argument could be used to say "miners in BTU would make larger blocks, and this hasn't happened"... obviously not, because Bitcoin doesn't accept their invalid blocks (even though they occasionally accidentally mine them). 


Nope, and calling it a "vote" is highly misleading, and if you have been paying attention, a lot of developers have taken great care to remind us that it is *not* a vote, no matter how many times misinformed folks try to describe it as such.
Miners signal *readiness*, they don't "vote"...  miners aren't voters in Bitcoin, they simply select and order transactions. It's a pretty common misconception that they "vote" on the protocol, so I'm not surprised that you're confused on this point, but that's just not an accurate description of how Bitcoin works, at least not today.
Full nodes enforce validity, defining consensus. Miners select and order transactions. Miners run full nodes (or at least they should), but so do other users of Bitcoin. That's why miners can't print themselves a million coins per block; everyone else would ignore them, since they're not playing by the rules that we are.

I'm hopeful that we've established strong support at the ~$1k area by hovering around it for so long. This should hopefully mean that the current price levels are basically the lowest we could reasonably expect a nasty post-moon bear market to ever reach.

bitcoind or bitcoin-qt
bitcoind is the "daemon", which will run the software without any pretty windows or displays, and if it's running, to see what's going on you would use bitcoin-cli (the "command line tool") to run commands in a shell window.
If you want to see a nice graphical interface (which I would guess that you do), run bitcoin-qt instead. It will do the same thing as bitcoind but *also* open up a new window where you can watch stuff happen and play around a little bit. It's a bit more user-friendly since you don't have to use the shell as much (though you still can if you want to). It is also a wallet.
Electrum is also wallet software, so it can be used to send or receive bitcoins, but it's not node software (so you wouldn't be downloading and validating the blockchain firsthand, and instead would submit your transactions to a network of "electrum servers" who *are* running full node software). There's a slight loss of privacy (since the server that handles your transactions can see what addresses you are working with) and you introduce a tiny bit more trust into the equation (by relying on these servers to do the blockchain validation), but it doesn't require you to download the blockchain *at all*, so it's super quick to work with. It's also quite user-friendly (or it was the last time I used it), and well-maintained, so it's a pretty popular client.

To say the least!
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:26:19
Bingo, you've got it.


On average today, about 70%. So assuming that most of the network starts using SegWit-style transactions (which would be cheaper, so there'd be good reason to), we'd be seeing anywhere from 1.8 to 2.3 MB blocks, on average, when they're full.
Miners would see their volume *increase*, because more transactions fit in each block, but they would also see their *fee per byte processed* decrease, because the witness portion pays 1/4 as much in fees as the rest of the transaction does.


Yeah, and in all honesty, actually less. Realistically, SegWit blocks will rarely ever even be larger than 2.6 MB or so. But since SegWit transactions aren't malleable, once it's active, we can start using Lightning Network on the network (there are already multiple working implementations that are usable on testnet, just waiting for SegWit to be activated to be used on mainnet too). The Lightning Network will surely start to handle more and more load as the tools to use it are refined and improved, and hypothetically it will give us thousandfold increases in throughput eventually as people use it more and more often for the lower-value transactions they need to make (freeing up much more space in each block for other transactions).
Other than Lightning Network, there are other cool things that SegWit would allow us to use, like aggregated Schnorr signatures (which can be up to 40% smaller than the ECDSA signatures that we use today, which gives us even *more* space per block, among other benefits like better privacy) and MAST, which can yield similar efficiency improvements (and other awesome stuff, well worth [reading more about]( if you're bored some time). These sorts of things become possible in a SegWit-active network, and they would allow significant capacity improvements without even increasing the blocksize (and making full nodes more expensive by doing so). In other words, they'd give us the best of both worlds: more transactions (and cheaper fees) *without* bigger blocks (and loss of decentralization). Win-win.
And *finally* (this is a crucial point): SegWit is not the final chapter in the Core Roadmap, in terms of blocksize increase. Core are very much committed to a hard fork to increase the blocksize further past SegWit, probably even with a "flexcap" that allows the blocksize to float upwards over time (like BU is trying to do), as long as there are proper incentive-balances included with the flexcap to prevent miners from abusing this mechanism maliciously, and harming network decentralization in the process. The reason why this isn't being done *before* or *along with* SegWit is because a lot of the engineers who contribute to Core are concerned about how the network will be affected by larger blocks, and they want to gather data from SegWit that they can use to inform their decisions and code for longer-term blocksize increase proposals. In other words, "first we see what effect the larger SegWit blocks have, and *then* we work out an agreeable longer-term blocksize strategy (including a hard-fork)"... this is all in the [Capacity Roadmap]( which (in my opinion) is a brilliant document that outlines a brilliant scaling strategy. 
That's one reason why I never understood the people who are anti-SegWit because they want bigger blocks... both because SegWit brings bigger blocks, immediately, and because it is the one thing we need to activate before Bitcoin Core is fully committed to working on hard forks for *even bigger* blocks!

You forgot the exchanges (Coinbase and Circle and Bitstamp and once upon a time Mt. Gox) and the nodes (which actually have massive influence -- arguably more than miners) and the "economic majority" who actually furnish the capital that keeps the system going. 
Even with these omissions, you yourself have acknowledged that there is no single point of control in Bitcoin, and that instead there is a complex system of checks and balances wherein many disparate parties enjoy varying degrees of power. No single entity can be identified as "the ruler of Bitcoin" and in fact if someone or something tried to claim such a title, they would have to earn support from the other industry-powerhouses or else their efforts would fail.
As a final note, this particular passage struck me as comical:


That doesn't make any sense. The entire point of Bitcoin (and the source of its antifragility) is the *lack* of a central/single point of failure.

I am sure that there are more that I have not discovered, because their development "team" is a joke and their code quality reflects this. I believe that Gregory Maxwell has disclosed a couple of exploits that he has found in their code, privately, to their developers, and there is a possibility that one of these is the one that I'm referring to. In any case, I am not as kind as he is, and will not help Bitcoin's enemies patch their vulnerable codebase.

The vast majority of transactions *today* have 2 outputs, yes. But that could very well be a result of the existing "treat all bytes as equal regardless of their actual respective costs to the network" paradigm.
Also, what matters is not *just* their size. Even if a transaction has 2 outputs, it makes a big difference whether it has 1 or 20 inputs. SegWit's blockweight calculation would make the latter much more affordable than it is right now, which would encourage UTXO consolidation (minimization).
Surely you see how that would be a good thing, right?

I was not previously aware of the "cancellation" issue. Fascinating stuff, and I'm glad to hear that the geniuses at Core have figured out a solution to the issue. Looking forward to that whitepaper.
Awesome stuff, as always.
It looks like we could very well see a BIP for Schnorr signatures roll out independent and irrespective of SegWit's activation, which is cool, but since this would require a new OP code anyway (and thus a soft fork), I guess there's still a chance that uncooperative miners attempt to block the upgrade's activation as they are with SegWit. Hopefully not, of course.

You are a troll. I decided to limit myself to *only your last week's worth of comments* to prove this point. It was still trivial to do so.
[Here is a comment]( where you say that Satoshi "recommended" that we hard fork to increase the block size, [deliberately bastardizing a quote from him]( like so many trolls like to do. In the same comment, you try to argue that Satoshi didn't intend for "economic controls" to result in a fee market, and that you think Satoshi would be pro-BU "because it restores the old status quo of transactions confirming quickly with no backlog".
This is, of course, a [grossly disingenuous misrepresentation of Satoshi's beliefs on the matter]( Like, [really bad]( Satoshi also explicitly said that alternative implementations (like BU) would **never** be a good idea, and would always and forever represent ["a menace to the network"]( In that same comment, Satoshi **very clearly indicated** that [he thought upgrades should be implemented *exactly* how SegWit is implemented]( There is no ambiguity on the matter; Satoshi would have supported SegWit and staunchly opposed BU. In light of Satoshi's statements here, you cannot honestly deny this fact. In doing so, you have gone full-troll. [Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin is the exact opposite of rbtc's vision for Bitcoin](
Furthermore, [Satoshi was notoriously supportive of limiting chain-growth]( and said (on many occasions) that by 2030 or so, "[the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes](

In [another comment]( made *on the same day* you made an assumption, and then later edited/deleted the comment because that assumption was incorrect. [One comment down]( you say:


In that same comment, you also take care to insult an entire subreddit:


[Here is a comment thread]( wherein you spend multiple paragraphs snarkily strawmanning Bitcoin Core and sarcastically attacking them, calling them a "centralized leadership group" and "the leaders of Bitcoin" using incredibly nasty verbiage. In that same thread, you write no less than **6** ridiculous troll comments attacking Bitcoin Core as an organization, Gregory Maxwell as an individual, and Lightning Network as an idea. You also take care to shill multiple altcoins along the way.
You go out of your way to misrepresent things regularly; [here you are]( misrepresenting the UASF proposal (pretending that it is Sybil-vulnerable, as if the proposal was just "quantity of nodes dictates rules" or somesuch strawman).
Beyond your usual misrepresentations, you like to directly lie a lot, too.
[Here is a comment]( where you lied, saying:


The truth of the matter is that 2014-03-19 [marked the first "Bitcoin Core" release]( whereas 2016-08-23 -- *2 and a half years later* -- was when [the internal CPU miner was removed from Core]( Who has time to fact check when you're just here to troll, though?
[Here is a comment]( where you claimed:


The truth of the matter is that Core had been working around-the-clock for *years* to improve scaling, and there was [near-unanimous consent among developers]( that a blocksize increase a la BIP101 was a dangerous, reckless, terrible idea to scale the network. Gavin and Mike, of course, plotted in secret to fork away from Core months in advance (as mentioned in the thread above) and deliberately went out of their way to ignore the peer review that they received on the proposal and implement it anyway, despite the massive controversy that this fostered. 
You also, hilariously enough, pretended naivety when it came to BU developers' ineptitude:


Anyone who has been paying even a cursory amount of attention knows that [the BU developers are malicious and/or incredibly incompetent]( Your feigned ignorance doesn't fool anyone, troll.

It would actually first go over 1MB in 2024, not 2027. Weird thing to lie about, but I suppose I don't put anything past you guys any more.
But I *am* glad to see that you acknowledge the fact that the Core developers were the only ones to keep their side of the "Hong Kong Agreement" and that the only ones who violated it were the miners. At least we see eye to eye on that.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:14:11
False. The only difference between a soft fork and a hard fork would be where the witness Merkle root goes (block header versus coinbase). Trivial, aesthetic difference.
Anyone who says "hard forked SegWit would be cleaner" has never written a line of code in their life, and can safely be assumed to be a total moron.

Actually, SegWit is significantly *less* complex than any hard fork code that has been written (and less complex still than reasonably *safe* hard fork code, which no one has produced yet).
None of the interesting vulnerability-protection mechanisms (like replay protection) exist in any of the alt clients trying to hard fork, because the developers of these clients are all amateurs without any serious knowledge of Bitcoin development. Their code is riddled with bugs and vulnerabilities, and plugging these up would introduce considerable complexity.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:14:39


Because not all bytes are equal. UTXO bloat is particularly costly on the network; incentivizing the minimization of it has been something that we have wanted to be able to do for *years*. With SegWit, we finally found an elegant way to do so.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:02:57
Yes indeed, as long as "valid" is a static target that isn't alterable by some privileged entities.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:34:03
Lightning Network is just waiting for SegWit. There are actually multiple working implementations/clients out there at this point:
* [Rusty Russell's](
* [Blockchain.com's Thunder](
* [Joseph Poon's and Roasbeef's Go implementation](
* [ACINQ's eclair](
None of these are in production usage, though (because SegWit isn't activated yet), and they are only usable on the testnet at the moment, where SegWit *is* already active. As such, they are considered alpha software. A couple of the implementations [won't even allow payments larger than $40 right now]( because:


In other words, we have working Lightning Network software, it's just not battle-tested yet, and to truly battle-test it we are waiting for SegWit to activate.

You seem like you genuinely want to learn more, so here's an easy-to-digest explanation (which is accurate to how SegWit works):
Basically, if your node asks "Hey, please give me block  then my node will respond "Alright, are you upgraded to support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you). 
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it. In effect, your node is basically running with the setting to prune witness data enabled by default.
This is how SegWit increases the blocksize while maintaining backwards-compatibility. Pretty clever, huh?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:52:29
You don't even need the dice. You're just incrementing a nonce over and over; mining doesn't require any other sources of entropy other than the nonce.

I like your Windows/Linux point, but you're still talking as if it's the early 2000s. 
These days, *nix systems power about 90% of computers (from the servers that the majority of the Internet is hosted on, to the OSX machines that so many people love and use, to 75-80% of the smartphones in the world). I appreciate you going out of your way to make a point for me.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:58:22
Yes, because SegWit provides the most scaling benefits in the safest possible way, and as such, managed to gain significant developer support very rapidly.
You're basically saying "Why are all the smart engineers so in favor of this particular proposal over the competing alternatives?" and then ignoring their thoughtful answers.

Except the fact that it was a direct result of Andrew Stone *directly merging bug-riddled code into the BU master branch* (on v1.0, no less!) without the code diff having *any* peer review whatsoever, which was then deployed directly into production...
Yeah, that was 100% due to the BU devs. The lead dev, in fact.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:07:23
No, it's really really really poorly written software which is maintained by one or two developers who have no idea what they are doing because they didn't get involved with Bitcoin development (or C++ at all, apparently) until about a year ago. 
They've already made so many amateur mistakes that it is astounding. The only reason that BU is still around is because it is being funded by one or two well-financed entities who want to gain control of Bitcoin for personal (greed) reasons.

This is also true...


It's not the worst option, at all. Having Bitcoin unilaterally controlled by a malicious and centralized entity is much, much worse of an option. I'd strongly prefer a trivial PoW change (and a temporary price slump) to a centralized and controlled Bitcoin, as would most here, I suspect.
You're likely being downvoted because you said "Uhm, no" to dismiss a perfectly realistic possibility without any effort at supporting your assertion, not because people mindlessly downvote anything that seems pro-BU. Though they might, and if so, frankly I don't blame them at this point. BU is basically Bitcoin's current arch-nemesis.
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:22:34
Yes, there is plenty of proof that Roger pays people to spread his narratives and push his agenda. He's not secretive about it. Multiple mods of his (bought and paid for) subreddit are on his payroll. He runs the Bitcoin birds "pay you for your pro-BU and anti-SegWit tweets" service. He runs Bitcoin.com (which he initially paid for and continues to pay for) which is constantly pumping altcoins and putting out "Bitcoin is shit, use [dash/eth/xmr] instead!" doomsday articles. He runs a mining pool that has paid out (out of pocket) *double* the block-reward at certain times as a "promotional" campaign.
Of course, you're a troll, so you don't care about the facts and the obvious truth here. But for everyone else, who is genuinely interested: yes, Roger Ver is spending lots of money to attack Bitcoin, and has been doing so for a long while now. This is not a secret, nor a conspiracy, just the facts.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:16:59
And, predictably, [Roger Ver is attacking him as a result](
Also, the irony in this particular sleight is palpable. Roger making fun of someone for spending time in prison is honestly something you couldn't make up if you tried.
I thought and Roger were friends. This isn't how a good friend treats his pal. I hope Roger is man enough to apologize about this, but I have my doubts that he will.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:58:40
See [here]( for the quote I was alluding to.


I think you mean "DoS" filter (because there wouldn't necessarily be anything "distributed" about an attack or exploitation of a "no-limit Bitcoin" by a given miner). But even setting that aside, you're only focusing on *one* specific benefit of the limit, and missing the rest.
The blocksize limit is a tool to restrict the power of Bitcoin miners. Yes, it provides protection against DoS attacks that might otherwise be perpetrated by clever and self-interested miners (or coalitions thereof), but that is not all it protects against. It is a node-enforced hard upper limit on how much data a Bitcoin block can contain, and as such, it provides a means for non-mining full-nodes to restrict the capabilities of mining enterprises; a miner is, of course, capable of violating this limit, but by doing so they risk rejection of their block(s) by the nodes that continue to enforce the limit locally.
Without such a limit, some Bitcoin tenets and assumptions as stipulated in Satoshi's whitepaper are invalid. In other words, a node-enforced limit is actually necessary condition for Nakamoto Consensus (at least as originally described in the whitepaper).
Satoshi never personally described all the benefits of and rationales behind the blocksize limit. In fact, when he first put it in place (in v0.3.1) he did not even mention it in the changelog or version notes, and when questioned privately about it, he asked that the newly-introduced limit not be mentioned in public (most likely because he understood that public disclosure of such changes invites malicious exploitation before the majority of nodes have a chance to upgrade to a non-vulnerable codebase). 
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:14:11
So, in other words, the miners violated their portion of the agreement. Meanwhile the Core representatives kept their side.
You can hem and haw about Adam Back's alleged duplicity all you want, but it's irrelevant to what the agreement actually stipulated.

It's so strange to me that people like you go around saying "this is how we should scale!" without even having a rudimentary understanding of SegWit.
SegWit increases the blocksize to *greater than 2MB*, and you didn't even know this. Why you feel qualified to offer input into the discussion is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:43:52
There are a number of criticisms.
* SegWit kills dragons. A staple of any dragon's diet is transaction malleability. SegWit would mean that there are fewer malleable transactions, which would mean that ultimately less dragons can survive in the food chain.
* SegWit means that we'll never achieve interstellar travel. Because the solar system actually needs our spirit energy to remain here in order to continually channel SegWit, we can never leave once it activates.
* SegWit represents a conflict of interests among the Great Gnome Kingdom. The Crown Gnome Prince advocates SegWit because he knows it is politically advantageous to do so. We do not know what he will do when he inherits the throne, so we need to take care not to let him spin things too much in his favor. 
* SegWit might tear the laws of physics asunder. Scientists believe that on a quantum level, SegWit would represent a dimensional shift and a new fold of the spacetime fabric. If not managed properly, this could compound into a nightmare doomsday scenario, where eventually the multiverse swallows itself into a hellscape of despair.
* SegWit might invoke the wrath of the Norse pantheon. Odin, Thor, and Loki all oppose SegWit. If it activates without them, they may have to manifest on our plane to express their great displeasure.
* SegWit is a silly word. Say it twenty times fast. By the end, you'll be like "lol SegWit? wtf is that!" Try it, you'll see.
* SegWit is actually a witch in disguise. She has had luck, so far, in remaining undetected, but if you look closely at the source code for long enough, you'll see her emerge.
* SegWit is racist. People of Hispanic and Ethiopian origin are forbidden from using it.
* SegWit is afraid of heights, bugs, and sharks. Some people say it is too cowardly to be added to Bitcoin.
These are some of the best arguments against SegWit. As you can see, there are many concerns here, and we as Bitcoin users need to weigh them all before deciding whether to support SegWit.

Yes, in fact, that's the entire subject of the thread you're posting in. They do exactly that, on a regular basis.


Hypothetically, they might indeed make the blocks larger... likely as a way to induce extra load on other miners competing with them, and give them an additional competitive advantage in mining.
That's a vulnerability.

@_date: 2019-03-29 03:58:16
No, not even close. Ethereum has essentially repurposed the deliberately specifically-optimized blockchain data structure to host a generalized state machine instead, at the very real cost of independent full validatability and additionally-necessary trustiness.
This does not *in any way* solve DDoS vulnerabilities like the ones discussed here. Nor does it achieve or make possible "unstoppable code" which is fundamentally *impossible* (not "hard", not "tricky", but actually conceptually *impossible*), and to reiterate what I was getting at above, when you involve networking in your process you actually confront even *more* impossibility results that were rigorously proven decades ago.
Altcoin sales brochures don't really factor in here; Ethereum might be doing something interesting, but it's not doing what you think it's doing, that's for sure.

Welcome to reddit! Satoshi and I both believe that the nature of Bitcoin is such that when the very first version was released, the core protocol properties were set in stone for all time.
You seem to want Bitcoin to be more malleable than that, morphing at the whims of miners.

Ethereum needed to fund their developers for their time spent programming, but by the nature of the system, the code had to be open source. So how would you finance such an operation, when any venture capitalist would immediately recognize that the end-product would still be just as available whether or not they provided you with capital?
The answer that Vitalik and co came up with was "We'll create a new token for our network, entirely distinct from Bitcoin, and sell these tokens for our financing!" And they designed Ethereum to incorporate these tokens, rather than bitcoins, because that was the only way for the plan to make any sense at all.
Meanwhile, others have recognized that any valuable smart-contract code that is developed by the Ethereum guys can be fairly simply adapted to work on top of Bitcoin, instead, and no one can stop them because (again) the code is open source. In the end, everyone is happy (except for, potentially, those who try to "invest" in Ether as a speculative asset), because the Ethereum team gets a fat stack of cash and Bitcoin ultimately gets the fruits of their labor anyway.
So, to answer your question: yes, what you can do in Ethereum you can also do with metalayers on top of Bitcoin (a la Rootstock, Aethereum, and colored coins).
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:53:38

Unstoppability is not an achievable goal, because something like "humans nuke each other to death" could always happen.
This isn't to say that Bitcoin is worthless or that blockchains aren't valuable. Bitcoin is great. But impossibility results like [FLP]( are still what they are. Bitcoin in particular achieved something incredible *in the face of such results* but it didn't (and couldn't) make these discoveries invalid.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge advocate for the liberties and opportunities that Bitcoin provides us, and I am not at all trying to argue that it is not decentralized, because it very much is (though almost no altcoins are truly decentralized like Bitcoin is). But the person I was responding to was just trying to insinuate that Ethereum somehow would help to prevent DDoS issues which it *absolutely* would not and could not do.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:00:53
BU doesn't have a 75% threshold of any sort.
Also, SegWit *was* a compromise. The BU devs have now admitted that even if Core made *all* the changes that are in BU, they would oppose them because they are Core. They're not interested in compromising, and have said this in public.
Also, the majority of hashpower does not seem interested in signalling support for *any* blocksize increase. The users and developers have all done what we can, we're just waiting on miners to lift the cap at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:48:22
Yes, it will prune on the fly if you have it set to the prune mode.
Interestingly, this was the *only* way it could be pruned (automatically, as you go) until the most recent version of Core (v0.14) when they added a "manual prune mode" that allows you to fiddle with it yourself. You probably don't want to do it this way, though, as having it do it automatically would make things easier. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:59:38
The problem is not that fees won't exist, it's that if there isn't a continual backlog of transactions pending confirmation in the mempool, competing for scarce blockspace (i.e. blockspace demand exceeds supply), then the rational mining strategy is not to extend the chain-tip, but to ignore blocks that claim the fees you would rather have yourself.
In other words, once block rewards are too low relative to fee rewards, the game theory behind mining breaks down, *unless* we have a blocksize limit inducing a (reasonably perpetual) backlog of transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:21:44
It is *not* trivial to do so. An incredible amount of code has changed, and copy+pasting will not work, for a number of reasons.
Frankly, BU does not have the developmental firepower to do what you suggest. It sounds like an easier task than it actually is.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:30:53


But I just demonstrated that it is exactly that. Are you ignoring everything I said on purpose? If so, why?


No, it is not. SegWit as a soft fork *could* be done without using any blockweight at all, but why would it? That wouldn't balance out incentives so desirably, nor would it allow a soft-fork blocksize increase. It would be worse all around.


Who would pay that fee? I don't think you've thought this through...


Why? I don't think you've thought this through...


Not true at all. That would only be true if we were already being as efficient as possible with UTXO creation. However, we are not, and we know this. Sites like SatoshiDice bloated the UTXO set grossly, because there was no reason to bother not to. The same phenomenon takes place (to a lesser degree, of course) in a thousand different ways by various services and usage habits that simply don't have enough of a reason to avoid doing so.
We could definitely take on more users without increasing the UTXO set; it would simply require the existing users and services to reduce their UTXO footprint. That's the point.


This sounds like rbtc nonsense. You're going to need to provide a citation for this, and it better be a good one, or else you basically admit "I AM A TROLL".

I clicked the link, but didn't find any "compromise proposal"... just more pointless and ignorant "why don't we also hard fork" nonsense.
A "compromise" would necessarily grant a concession to the decentralists (who don't believe a blocksize increase is a good thing in the first place). SegWit itself, then, is a compromise, because it does increase the blocksize.
In what way is "adding an unnecessary and dangerous hard fork on top" a compromise at all? Do you even know what the word "compromise" means?
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:21:55
SegWit *is* the compromise.
If you were to add hard fork code to it, we would need replay protections and other safeguards, probably a year or so of testing, and an extra 6-month lead time to get it safely deployed.
A hard-fork+SegWit package would not be ready for activation until (probably) 2019 or 2020.

The constant in question has literally *nothing* to do with Blockstream. Like, actually nothing. The only reason "BLOCKSTREAM" is included in that codebase is as an attempted pejorative because it is synonymous with "Boogeymen" in the cesspool echo-chamber subreddit.
The codebase that many Blockstream employees develop on (Bitcoin) doesn't even *have* that constant anymore. It was removed multiple versions ago and replaced with a larger limit (4M blockweight limit). 
There is no possible way to legitimately spin this as "not trolling" and you yourself are trolling by trying to do so.

BU represents a hostile attack on Bitcoin, run by incompetent but well-funded malicious businessmen. Right now they are using all of their might to stall the activation of an upgrade to Bitcoin which would give us a plethora of capacity benefits (called SegWit), which was developed by Bitcoin Core.

So the question is: "what are the signs that a reddit account is a sockpuppet account"?
Well, account age is an important factor. Generally, newer accounts with fewer posts are more likely to be socks.
Another good one is "disparity of comments"; if an account only posts in one or two niche subreddits, and only expresses one particular narrative or view ad nauseum, that's a strong indication that they're a sockpuppet.
If, in the account posting history, you see a *lot* of advocacy but a distinct *lack* of logic or substantive reasoning, that's another good sign.
And if the account seems to be pushing a particular agenda *extra hard*, and that's an agenda that is pushed strongly  by other (already previously identified) sockpuppets, that's *very strong evidence* that you're looking at a sockpuppet account.
Now, these are just general rules-of-thumb, and by no means conclusive nor comprehensive. Some people are just dumb and new to reddit and even if they *look* like a sock, they're actually just a harmless numpty. So you have to play it by ear a little bit.
And, of course, I'm making a mistake here by letting you know how to avoid detection a little bit better. But this is for the benefit of other readers who might be interested in how I'm so easily identifying the obvious sockpuppet brigade here.

It does.
Have you seen Bitcoin stop handling transactions? I certainly haven't. Perhaps you're looking at an altcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:44:48
Obviously not, we just know not to invest more than we can afford to lose, and are timing our entries as optimally as possible.
Even if I know for 100% fact that Bitcoin will be worth $100000 in exactly 1 year, I won't go all-in right now. I'll wait for a dip to maximize my coins per dollar.
This really isn't that hard to understand. Maybe an introductory course in Economics or Finance would help you more than trying to argue on Reddit...
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:17:08
Fair enough, and well-articulated.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:21:30
No, you're fudging the numbers, and badly.
3600 coins are introduced into the network every single day. It doesn't matter whether those who mine these coins hold them, sell them, or give them away to friends and family; the supply inflates by 3600 no matter what, and these coins wind up on the hard drives of those who demand them.
After July 10, only 1800 coins will be being introduced into the network every day. That means, if demand remains approximately constant, about 1800 coins will need to be bought per day at market-rates to satisfy it. 
1800 coins' worth of exchange volume is **not at all** the same thing as 1800 coins being bought at market-rates in a day.
This is the upwards price pressure that the halving will provide. The fact that people are still trying to downplay or discount this is both ridiculous and reassuring, because it definitively shows that the effect has not been priced in. Not even close.
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:32:54

@_date: 2017-03-12 22:15:43
Ah, I'm glad you've clarified your own thoughts on the matter here.


SegWit is just *one* idea... a new transaction format which allows the segregation of witness data from base transaction data. That's it.


Neither of those were done as hard forks. Those were both soft forks. I mean, you can go to the actual BIP pages themselves ([BIP16]( [BIP65]( and this is the first thing you'll see at the top of the page: 


So I'm glad that we've been so easily able to identify a logical misstep here.


Good news, [it was]( 
So am I to understand that you support SegWit, now that you know this?


That is literally all it is, though. Every single benefit of SegWit is a scaling benefit. 


It is.


That's not possible.


Blocksize is a consensus parameter, and clearly belongs in that list, just like the other two. Without such a limit, all sorts of nasty attacks become possible... preventing such attacks, and allowing consensus to be deterministically achieved, is why the limit exists.




I'm glad you asked. No, it does not make sense, because SegWit is *one change* with *many benefits*. I expanded on this in [another thread]( where you and I were quoted. You might also find the (rather long) [parent comment]( informative, too.
The good news here is that you seem to be reasonably intelligent, and I'm hopeful that you can integrate this new information successfully and not cling irrationally to the old, mistaken beliefs that were previously held. The bad news is that your beliefs on the matter were most definitely mistaken, and they've led you to incorrect conclusions, as I've tried to help demonstrate. 
Please don't take offense at any of this. I'm not trying to attack you. I am frustrated with how much misinformation there is regarding SegWit out there, and I'm doing my best to correct it. It's hard to tell someone they are wrong about something without giving offense, but I've given it my best shot here... the ball is in your court, though, and I really hope you can keep an open mind here and listen to what I'm telling you without bias interfering.

@_date: 2016-06-14 14:12:40
More like: you support A and think it would be very easy to do A; B was our best effort at doing A, and demonstrates just how difficult doing A actually is.
Whether or not you support B is irrelevant, because the point is that we don't have a better way to do A, and you're not providing an alternative implementation to B.

Amazing piece. Good work.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:59:48
Lightning Network is already built and operational. It was built with the assumption that transaction malleability is solved for the transactions using it, because that's how it works best and most securely and simply. SegWit transactions are unmalleable, so Lightning Network is already working on testnet (where SegWit is active) and will work on mainnet as soon as SegWit is activated on it.
At this point, both are ready, but miners do not appear to be in any rush to increase transaction capacity. This isn't surprising; the network hasn't experienced any issues as a result of full blocks, and miners' fees (and thus revenue) are maximized over the short term with full blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:22:50
Yes, I'm well aware. SegWit originally did not include a blocksize increase. It was added as a compromise to the "big blockers", despite them representing a vocal minority.

Multiple blockchains don't really make sense, and especially not for value or money tokens. Clever engineering will give us exponentializing solutions a la Lightning Network. 
Bitcoin maximalism really does make the most sense, when you thoroughly think things through. Oh well, everyone wants to be an earlier adopter than they were.

That's not true at all. Bitcoin's difficulty algorithm would prevent you from succeeding in this. If you invest tens of millions of dollars into SHA-256d ASICs, such that you can mine blocks at *the current network difficulty*, then you could perhaps pull this off... but at that point you "ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules," as Satoshi put it.

@_date: 2016-06-19 18:29:07
Well, if Ethereum bails out TheDAO, or blacklists the attacker's stash, or does anything at the protocol level to try to reverse what has happened, then yes, Ethereum itself was compromised.
Of course, if they let TheDAO crash and burn, then the protocol itself wasn't compromised. Ether price will crash massively, but the core platform would not have been violated in an hilariously irredeemable way.

The Bitcoin stack can already handle effectively infinite transactions per second, but in order to preserve and strengthen its fundamental value proposition, the Bitcoin community prioritizes validability over throughput on the base layer.

I don't agree that this is a "high number" because Chinese exchanges are fee-less. 100x might be more accurate, but at the end of the day, these numbers are just being pulled out of assholes; without a realistic way to estimate this, the analysis is completely meaningless.


20x is "a very high average turn-over"? No, again, I disagree.


No, not at all. This is what I'm trying to convey here, and it's the crucial insight that you're missing. Tracing how many hops/trades a coin undergoes isn't relevant. It could be 0 (the miner just holds the coin) or it could be 10,000; the effect on the price is identical in both cases. What's relevant (price-wise) is that the coin ultimately winds up in the hands of someone who **demands** it, and is not willing to sell it at the current price.
The bottom line is: one coin being held while the price is $X reflects &gt;= $X worth of demand. The source of this demand (miner, non-miner, whatever) does not matter at all.

It seems like you haven't researched or understood the context of that particular quote. Satoshi was actually chiming in to warn people **against** trying to increase the blocksize limit before full community consensus had been achieved. He weighed in to **support theymos** and **strongly warn against running Jeff Garzik's "patch"**, and the quote you've used here represents a direct response to concerns that such updates must then be *altogether impossible* to safely activate, based on Satoshi's firmly-vocalized opposition to the proposed blocksize-limit increase.
In short, you just quoted Satoshi explaining that it is possible to make non-backwards-compatible consensus code updates as long as you take extreme precautions about how they are implemented and rolled out.
Hope that helps to clarify the subject a bit for you. I know that the anti-Bitcoin community has been very militant about misleading people with this particular quote, so it's not a surprise that you fell victim to the campaign.

But hey, I'm happy to oblige here! His "actual arguments" are... wait for it... you ready for this? This:


**That** is what you are defending as "rational arguments". 
Do I need to point out the obvious here? I'm betting yes.
1) That's not an argument. In any way, shape, or form. I'm not saying "that's a *bad* argument" or "I disagree with that argument", I'm telling you that **there is no argument there, at all**. No argument exists. It's not an argument, much less multiple argument*s*. 
2) It's not rational, as I explained in my initial response.

Yes, that was super weird. He awkwardly called himself out on it for a second, too, in a very strange moment.
The thing is, that wasn't even the worst part of the video. By constantly talking over Charlie rather than let him finish his thoughts (not to mention his obvious attempt to weaponize questions) Roger really comes across as a bully and aggressor here. His whole "argument" is ridiculous for the reasons you laid out, and he even (sort of) tries to pretend like he was the one running the isolated Lightning Node he mentioned, as if that particular lie would make his obviously-flawed reasoning somehow justified.
As a final note, I hope to never have to sit through another session of Roger repeating the words "male genitalia" over and over and over.
Can you believe that **this (apparently truncated) video clip was published by Bitcoin.com**, meaning that it was probably the highlight Roger was most proud of? That *really* puts things in perspective.

The blocksize debate is a matter of some people not understanding engineering concepts. It is not a detriment to Bitcoin at all, it's just noisy morons being noisy morons as the smart people continue to do their thing.
The censorship was mainly just one arrogant smart kid deciding to shut those noisy morons up a little bit. If it were a serious problem, the community would have sought other discussion venues. As it is, the only ones who did so were the noisy morons. Again, this isn't a detriment to Bitcoin at all. No reason it should have an adverse effect on the price.
And mining isn't centralized at all. Some people (again, mostly noisy morons) don't understand what pooled mining is or how it works, so they shout about mining centralization without knowing any better.
This comment here (the one you wrote) pretty much shows how strong of an understanding you have of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, it's not flattering for you.

It doesn't make *any* sense to tell an entire group of experts "Change the software you maintain to put in this stuff that almost every single one of you agrees is a bad idea!" and expect them to do what you ask. Core has not demonstrated "obstinance" in any respect. 
Furthermore, the community at large (*much* larger than the circle of developers that make up Bitcoin Core) has, time and time again, rejected the terrible hard fork proposals that have been presented. The best thing I've seen so far, in terms of a hard fork proposal, is Spoonnet. But we don't need to hard fork right now, so Spoonnet can continue to be improved until we have a good reason to, and the community is in agreement on how it should be done. You don't see me running around demanding that the Spoonnet changes be merged into Core, do you? That's because I try to be a reasonable person, and I understand that there isn't widespread agreement on such a hard fork. This should be how things are handled, not by "doubling down on the stupid" and just shouting louder. That just slows things down.
The good news is, it looks like the enemies of Bitcoin have finally spun off into their own altcoin. This should (hopefully) speed development up in Bitcoin proper, since a lot of the noisiest and least-informed voices will be concentrating their efforts elsewhere.

As I've said (three times now), this is false. My comments explain exactly why. I am surprised you're still repeating this, considering how thoroughly debunked it just was.
Repeating the same misinformation over and over again as people correct you doesn't make it true.


By the way, if you want to adopt the perspective of a non-upgraded node, then the alternative proposals (hard-forks) mean that **not only are 0conf transactions insecure, but all post-fork transactions and blocks are invalid**. The node is forked off the network and then completely vulnerable to defraudation.
Non-upgraded nodes, in a hard fork, are useless. 


No, it doesn't. This shows (more) misunderstanding. 
A wallet without a node cannot use Bitcoin. A node is *strictly necessary* to involve for a Bitcoin transaction to be sent or received. So underneath (or behind) any wallet software will be a node, whether run by the same user or not, which is relaying the transaction information to the wallet.
It all comes down to the node here.


You're actually completely right on this point. I misspoke, good catch.

There's not a road block that I can see. SegWit is available as a safe and smart capacity increase, if/when such an increase becomes a pressing priority for the miners. Evidently increasing capacity is *not* such a priority at this time. You can't argue against the data.
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:29:48
If SegWit is active, that means 95% of the miners have signalled support. That means that the longest chain contains SegWit blocks, and is supported by the majority of the hashrate (or as you called it, the "CPU power").
I don't want to be rude here, but it sounds like you are deeply confused about SegWit. I am happy to keep answering questions, though.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:42:55
Ok, so you're confused, and that's okay. I'll help.
Imagine I set up a tiny little exchange called "tinylittlebitcoinexchange.com" and I send 1 BTC to a wallet there under User  and $600 to a wallet there under User 
You with me so far?
Now imagine I set up a script that just takes the $600 in User  account, and buys the 1 BTC from User  account. That counts as 1 BTC worth of volume traded on my exchange, so far.
Now imagine this script then does the same thing backwards (buys the 1 BTC from User  with the $ in User  account)... that's 1 more BTC of volume on my exchange.
Now the script just repeats steps 1 and 2, and does this 100x every second, all day long. At the end of the day, tinylittlebitcoinexchange.com will have 8,640,000 BTC of volume traded! That's **over half of the bitcoins in existence**, traded on my exchange, in just one day!!! That represents $5,184,000,000 worth of trades!
Now think about this... all I *really* had on my site was 2 accounts, one script, and 1 BTC. Yet my volume figures show that my exchange traded over 8 million coins that day.
**That** is roughly how accurate Chinese exchange volumes are. If the exchange isn't charging fees on the trades made on their platforms, then their volume is almost guaranteed to be horrendously misleading.
So, in other words, **no**, OKCoin does not "own over 90%" of bitcoins. Not even close. 
I hope this was educational.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:07:04
Think about this for a second. 
If you spend Bitcoin, it is usually through Coinbase or Bitpay, and the merchant on the other end is usually converting to dollars/fiat upon receipt. This amounts to demand *leaving* Bitcoin, having a net negative effect on the price of Bitcoin.
If, instead, you accept payment in Bitcoin (and do not convert immediately to dollars), it is, in effect, you *buying* coins. It has a net positive effect on the price. 
What you have said above is false. The details of how the bitcoins are being transacted very much matter in terms of price effect. It is marginal, but that's always going to be the case.

This is 100% incorrect, and is the source of all your confusion. SegWit transactions are actually marginally *larger* than legacy transactions. But since the blocksize limit (1MB) is replaced with a blockweight limit (4MB) with SegWit, more transactions can fit in any given block.
It is so peculiar to me that people like you are constantly going around spreading blatant misinformation like this, especially because it is so simple to determine the actual truth of the matter. I wonder: what do you get out of lying? Or is this completely unintentional, and just a case of remarkably-persistent ignorance?

Well said. I didn't appreciate the concept of "antifragility" before seeing it manifest through Bitcoin. Threats really do seem to make it grow stronger, in a surprising (but always logical) way. Viewed from the ground floor and observing things on a day-to-day basis, it's tempting to "get caught up in it all" and feel stress or excitement regarding the latest drama, but if you take a metaphorical step back, it seems that Bitcoin still has its thrusters aligned and that Total World Domination is still profoundly underway.

That's exactly my point! Transaction fees will need to be supplying the bulk of the mining incentive well *before* then; we know that. Which is why it is perfectly normal to see a healthy fee market develop and grow. We are getting to see Satoshi's vision vindicated beautifully, and so far it looks like his idea is working!

I didn't say you *realized* that's what you were saying.

You just said "I hate Picasso-style paintings" even though you didn't realize that you were saying so. I don't have to extrapolate to know this, I just have to understand the subject of discussion (in my analogy, I just have to know that the paintings were made by Picasso).
So, yes, you did say that.

It is *usually* best to hold off on sinking too much into Bitcoin when it is in the middle of a crazy rally like this. You're right that a pullback is coming (though it could be from $4.3k to $1k **or** it could be from $10k to $5k... we won't know for sure until after it plays out).
If you're interested in the technology and want some skin in the game, consider buying something small like $10 worth. That should familiarize you with the process, at least, and you'll learn a lot from doing so without really putting yourself at risk of financial ruin.

To put it another way: the 2x folks are (apparently) intent on attacking the network. What is the best way to minimize the damage from this attack (i.e. defend against it)?
Abandoning Bitcoin via a rushed and controversial hard fork is almost certainly not the best way to do so. If you ask me, the best you can do is make sure that Bitcoin nodes cease communication with attacking nodes (which was implemented in Core 0.15) and then work to educate the community at large of the risks of the hostile chain (and its lack of replay protection).
In other words, at least in my opinion, the most responsible path forward is exactly the path that we are currently taking.

Yes, including &gt; and once the subreddit is large they do not change the rules abruptly just because moderators want it.
That's not true at all. Rules are added and updated all the time as communities grow. You've clearly never been a part of an online community as it "crossed the chasm" and went through the evolution into Eternal September mode... and you've clearly never moderated a large community yourself. You have a set of beliefs rooted in naivety, and are apparently willing to erect strawmen and fabricate things on the spot to defend these beliefs. 
Again, if you're not a fan of a particular community or its ruleset, find another one that suits you better, and don't come back to the one you don't like. It really is that simple.

They'd be killing an altcoin, not Bitcoin.
Again, Bitcoin has consensus parameters. Stuff like "21 million coin limit" and "you can't spend someone's coins without satisfying the associated Script encumbrance". Violating these consensus parameters **by definition** means that you are no longer using Bitcoin, you're using an altcoin. It doesn't matter one bit how much hashpower you throw at this altcoin, it can't be Bitcoin, by definition.
The whitepaper makes this very clear. If Bitcoin were simply "whoever dedicates the most hashpower gets to decide the rules" it would be uninteresting and none of us would be here today because it never would have grown to any degree of significance.
It's good that you're trying to think about this stuff. It's bad that you're so confused, and apparently unwilling to learn from those who know more than you.
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:40:09
It's not an "indisputable fact" at all, actually. BCH could perhaps most accurately be described as an "airdropped altcoin" rather than an actual "fork" just like CLAMS was an airdropped altcoin.
Just because holders of Bitcoin automatically received free BCH doesn't mean it was a "fork", though of course their code was forked from Bitcoin's (just like Litecoin's was).

The only way that Satoshi will be "exposed" is if he *wants* to be. And as of right now, as much as I would love to know the details of who he is, it is looking *far* more likely that this never happens.


Au contraire, you just haven't understood any of the comments that I've left here. Again, you're a newbie here, so it's understandable, but you need to learn to listen more than you talk. You're embarrassing yourself in ways you can't even see yet.

No, it did not, actually, and Wikipedia is full of incorrect (and/or obsolete) information when it comes to many subjects under the cryptocurrency umbrella. 
Factually speaking, **all Bitcoin peers continued to track the Bitcoin chain.** No chain-split occurred. *Even* "pseudo-nodes" like Bitcoin Unlimited clients continued to follow along with the single canonical Bitcoin chain. A relatively small subset of miners did direct hashpower to another network, but if *that* qualifies as "Bitcoin splitting" then you're arguing that Namecoin, Bytecoin, 21Coin, etc were *all* Bitcoin splits. That's a *nonstandard definition*, to say the least. 
What happened on August 1, 2017 is that a *new altcoin* (known as "bcash" or on Ver/Wu-owned fora as "Bitcoin Cash", originally with the ticker symbol BCC and eventually BCH) was launched which granted Bitcoin UTXO owners with a free existing balance on the new chain.
This is, **by definition**, a [coin airdrop]( (oh, look at that, a Wikipedia link corroborating what I said!).
I can factually confirm that I was a recipient of the airdropped altcoin, which I converted to Bitcoin later (at roughly twice today's price conversion ratio).
On [Bitcoin airdrop websites]( like [this one]( BCH is almost [always prominently listed]( On pages [explaining what crypto airdrops are]( it is often mentioned as a prototypical example. 


Now, you are clearly faced with factual references which demonstrate that your accusations against others "spreading lies" are unfounded and untrue. If you continue to spread false and malicious propaganda and trolling (especially with the apparent intent of shilling altcoins), you run the risk of overstaying your welcome on this particular forum (i.e. you will be banned for continued rule infractions). Consider this your warning.

Also, for the record, this is self-contradictory:


There's no such thing as a "Bitcoin node running the ABC client" and this is, in fact, a contradiction in terms.
Of course, you seem to be here to lie and spread false propaganda, so casual contradictions like this aren't terribly surprising.
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:24:49
You say that you understand the link, but then the rest of your comment appears to contradict that assertion.
Please try re-reading your own comment for a moment. You'll likely realize that it isn't really coherent and that there is no thesis or central argument (it's more like word soup).
We are talking about when the block subsidy is &lt;0.4 btc per block (circa 2034). At that point, the primary (and for all practical intents and purposes, *only*) incentive for miners to provide network security will be transaction fees.
So, once again, I recommend taking a step back here and trying to understand what I'm telling you. We have less than 2 decades before the fee market is practically the sole incentive-source sustaining Bitcoin mining, which is *far* less than the ~120 year figure that you were quoting upthread. 
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:03:13
From [the whitepaper]( itself:


Satoshi [also said]( *very* early on, in response to theymos' asking "Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?":


Here you can see that Satoshi *explicitly* mentions "a few decades" and "20 years" as the relevant time horizons over which the transition from block-reward-subsidy to fee-based incentives occurs. He is also explicitly acknowledging that the transition to a fee-based network is in order to protect the finitude of the network tokens.
This, alone, proves my point. 
I'll keep going, though, to give you plenty of references if you're interested in learning more about this.
[More from Satoshi on this subject](








transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value from 
any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client 
software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended 
payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive value 
when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in 
the block.


[Satoshi also said]( "There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by 
transaction fees alone" and "With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive." 
Moving past just Satoshi references (after all, this isn't an appeal-to-authority, I'm merely explaining how Bitcoin is envisioned to work over the long term, and demonstrating that this has been well understood in the community since the very beginning)...
In the very first section on ["Bitcoin Basics"]( you will see:


From the same wiki, the [Transaction fee]( page explains:


And [from the wiki FAQ](

Or [see here](

More-technical resources which go into more depth explaining how the Bitcoin protocol works, under the hood, also explain this aspect of Bitcoin, e.g. [this one](


Here are some analyses regarding the transition from block-reward (inflation-based) incentives to transaction fee incentives, in the long term, and the effects this will have on Bitcoin mining:

This sort of thing is what phor2zero was referring to [upthread]( when they commented:


Hopefully that makes more sense to you now.

Bitcoin blocks being full is not a bad thing, though. In fact, it is *necessary* for the game theory behind the blockchain to succeed, over the long term (and I don't mean centuries, I mean decades or perhaps even *years*). 
Why, exactly, do you believe that "full blocks" is a problematic condition for Bitcoin to be in? Is there *any* reasoning, at all, beyond the "full blocks means higher fees, higher fees bad"? Because in my opinion, that argument is naive, misguided, myopic, even outright stupid. If there's more to the argument than such nonsense, though, I would absolutely love to hear it. I'm always happy to hear clear-headed reasoning on such subjects.
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:39:38
You just missed the entire point.
We're about *a decade* away from the mining reward being effectively completely replaced by transaction fees. The last satoshi will be mined a century after that or so, but we will have to rely on transaction fees, almost exclusively, as the mining incentive, by **2034**.

It wasn't "hacked", it simply expired, which allowed it to be re-registered by someone else and used.


No, again, you should really do some research into this stuff before trying to weigh in on it. Not a single bitcoin address ever used above block height 200 has been definitively linked to Satoshi. He can (and probably has) transacted plenty out in the open, simply spending from mining rewards from his most-recently mined blocks (rather than spending his rewards in chronological order, which would make no sense for any privacy-conscious individual). 
To demonstrate my point, check out [this address]( If I told you that this was an address controlled by Satoshi, would you believe me? Could you prove my claim to be true? Could you disprove it? Could you "track Satoshi down" based on the address activity?
For a final time, seriously, you need to do a *lot* of research before you can competently contribute to the conversations around here. Right now, it's clear you're at the absolute-beginner level, in terms of understanding and knowledge. It's a steep learning curve, but you can definitely climb it.

It basically filters out a lot of noise, because, for instance, if you send 0.1 btc back and forth between two addresses &gt;100x, it stops counting anything after transaction 
It's a much better metric because it's less game-able.

From [the whitepaper]( itself:


Satoshi [also said]( *very* early on, in response to theymos' asking "Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?":


Here you can see that Satoshi *explicitly* mentions "a few decades" and "20 years" as the relevant time horizons over which the transition from block-reward-subsidy to fee-based incentives occurs. He is also explicitly acknowledging that the transition to a fee-based network is in order to protect the finitude of the network tokens.
This, alone, proves my point. 
I'll keep going, though, to give you plenty of references if you're interested in learning more about this.
[More from Satoshi on this subject](








transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value from 
any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client 
software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended 
payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive value 
when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in 
the block.


[Satoshi also said]( "There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by 
transaction fees alone" and "With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive." 
Moving past just Satoshi references (after all, this isn't an appeal-to-authority, I'm merely explaining how Bitcoin is envisioned to work over the long term, and demonstrating that this has been well understood in the community since the very beginning)...
In the very first section on ["Bitcoin Basics"]( you will see:

No, in the current network, the sigops problem can, at worst, result in a transaction that takes a couple-hundred *seconds* to verify. This is annoying, but by no means fatal. 
Because this figure scales quadratically (on non-SegWit transactions), a relatively minor blocksize increase could result in transactions that take **more than ten minutes** to validate. This is a *new* attack vector, because it would take competing miners *longer to validate than the average interval between blocks*, i.e. they cannot really compete any more. It becomes a "If you can't beat them, join them" scenario, and the big hostile miner/pool gobbles up all competitors (or alternatively leaves them in the dust). And it is most profitable to try doing exactly this. The incentives are actually aligned for this eventuality to manifest.
So, you're right that it gets "much more dangerous"... it gets arguably fatal for Bitcoin as a whole. 
This is just *one* example of a *known* attack vector that the 1MB limit is currently preventing. There are more (both known and, likely, unknown). Which is why, when the experts and engineers all seem to agree that we need to approach something like this carefully, everyone should pay attention. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:29:45


By what authority do you declare this? Why is that the most important issue, and how do you reconcile this declaration with the fact that the majority of the ecosystem and industry has repeatedly expressed, in no uncertain terms, that this is *not* "the most important issue right now"?
There is widespread agreement that it is *an* important issue, and in fact years of development and testing has culminated in SegWit to provide capacity improvements safely to Bitcoin.


That is a *perfect* description of SegWit. Every single one of SegWit's benefits concerns improving capacity. It *is* a scaling solution, through and through, and nothing else.
I'm having trouble trying to imagine what convinced you otherwise. What did you *think* SegWit did?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:19:18


Why not? What, in particular, seems nonsensical about it? We know that the network will have to transition to transaction-fee-based incentives over the next decade or two, so what quantitative arguments do you have regarding alternative transition schedules that you believe to be more optimal? 
Ask yourself this: have you put a serious amount of thought and effort into determining an optimal timeline for the transition of mining incentives from seigniorage to fee-collection, and arrived at specific numerical values for what you think the relevant figures should be? 
If not, your argument seems to boil down to: "I'm kind of grumpy that fees have risen a few pennies." It's not really an argument at all, just an unfortunate result of miseducation on the subject of Bitcoin. Miseducation which is, sadly, all-too-common.
I'm sorry if I have been rude during our conversations, but try to put yourself into the shoes of those of us who have put a *ton* of effort and energy into researching the technical foundations and underpinnings of Bitcoin, studying and building on the source code, participating in development discussions over the course of multiple years... as giant waves of uninformed (or misinformed) people continually show up into some of these message boards, we have found ourselves combating a seemingly endless stream of ignorance. It can get really frustrating, especially as there are some people out there who will *go out of their way to spread misinformation* on certain subjects, no matter how much energy you put into debunking their lies and no matter how polite you are about it. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish between legitimately confused people, and those who have some sort of ulterior motive. Anyway, regardless, I apologize.

People have been talking about how big a problem the 21M cap (and resulting deflationary behavior) would be, since *before the 1MB limit was even in place*.
So, once again, if you want to call the 1MB limit "artificial" and be consistent, then all of Bitcoin consensus is artificial, too. Including the 21M coin limit.
You are free to do so, of course. It just seems a bit silly to me.

In aggregate, they must. This has been known since the day the whitepaper was debuted (Halloween 2008). That is how the incentives have been structured since the very beginning.


No, not "instead" at all. That's an egregious misconstruation of what I have said. 
It seems like you were under the impression that Bitcoin *relies* on a price doubling (at least) once every four years. If that were the case, it would have been doomed from day one, and none of us would be here discussing it. Fortunately, that is not the case at all. Satoshi had an answer to the problem of "How can mining incentives be sustained without sacrificing token finitude?" which is "transaction fees", and was very open about this solution.


Yes, it is. We have all known this since October 31, 2008 when Satoshi first described the system he came up with. It is not a secret.


No, it doesn't. The purpose of the geometric reward drop-off is to ensure token finitude. This is not compromised whatsoever by the reward subsidy being replaced over time by transaction fees as the primary incentive mechanism powering competitive Bitcoin mining.
I mean no offense by this, but this is really basic stuff. Are you sure you don't want to have a private-message based conversation where I can help answer the questions you have? Some one-on-one attention can go a long way...

Bitcoin *is* antifragile, but only because Bitcoiners are incentivized to protect themselves and their network against hostile attacks like this.
Antifragility is *not* some magic property that requires zero human interaction. That is a strawman that Buttcoiners have been beating to death for years, unwittingly making fools of themselves the entire time.
If someone is breaking the law to attack Bitcoin in some way, prosecuting them and bringing them to legal justice **is a manifestation of antifragility**, *not* a demonstration of fragility. Obviously settling things without getting the State involved is preferable in most cases, but turning to a government when appropriate is a valid tactic and strategy sometimes, whether you like it or not.
Similarly, this is a free market, and bad actors like Jihan Wu are free to orchestrate attacks on the network and technology like this. **The wider community acknowledging and mitigating such threats is a beautiful example of antifragility in action.**

Oh, you've missed the point entirely. That's ok, a lot of people take a while to get this.
So, do you know what the concept of a "smart contract" is? Do you what makes a smart contract different from other types of contracts? 
First, make sure you can answer the above questions. I am happy to help if you need it. Once you are satisfied that you understand the answers to the above questions, you can proceed...
Do you know that Ethereum's entire purpose is to execute smart contracts faithfully, explicitly executing the code as written? Do you know that this is the one and only role it is designed to fill?
Make sure that you can answer those questions, too. Go read the Ethereum whitepaper if you need to. It's important that you understand this fact, too, otherwise you won't be able to appreciate where this leads...
Once you're satisfied that you understand smart contracts and the fact that Ethereum is built solely to execute such contracts, objectively and without bias, you are finally ready to get the point...
*If* TheDAO is bailed out, *it wholly and irrefutably defeats the entire point of Ethereum*. It demonstrates that Ethereum, at least in extreme circumstances, is **not** a faithful smart contract execution platform. It is not immutable. There are loopholes, and they're evidently pretty easy to miss. Even the creator of the Ethereum language himself reviewed the DAO code and missed a blatant and critical security vulnerability. A valid contract is being invalidated retroactively by a central agency politically intervening. 
Every conceivable value to Ethereum is fundamentally undermined by this single demonstration. It is showing, right now, that the overlords and community are much more interested in propping up the price of the token (the permanently-inflationary token that was explicitly *not* designed to be optimal from a monetary view) than actually adhering to the Ethereum vision. Go read those chat logs where the Ethereum Foundation was frantically trying to get every exchange to halt **all crypto trading, deposits, and withdrawals* so that they could keep Ethereum from collapsing. The desperation is palpable. Ethereum has undeniably shifted into the "Pump N Dump Shitcoin" category at this point; whatever problems it was originally built to solve have been abandoned out of short-term, short-sighted greed.
In the case of Bitcoin, greed is carefully taken into account, and it serves as a propellant force to the growth and adoption of the network. In Ethereum, it is objectively preventing the system from doing what it was built to do. No matter how "cool" you think it is to be able to retroactively invalidate a "smart" contract if the community demands and/or it is otherwise coerced into happening, there is no way to deny that this is directly at odds with the point of doing things with smart contracts in the first place. If we just want to have a rule-by-mob or rule-by-central-agency contract execution platform, there are much simpler, much more cost-efficient, much more secure, and much more reliable ways we can achieve it. Again, the whole entire purpose of Ethereum was to make an inviolate Virtual Machine that follows programmatic contracts to the letter, without possibility of interference, and it was engineered with this purpose in mind. Many tradeoffs were made to achieve this (and personally I believe many poor design decisions were made on top of this, but that's not relevant to the point here), but up until now it looked like it might at least do what it purports to... maybe not efficiently or practically, but at least objectively. Now that this principle is being abandoned (despite the whole "this is our one and only 'get out of jail free' card, guys, we totally promise!"), there's no actual reason at all for Ethereum to exist, other than as a speculative toy. A pretty bad long-term investment, too, considering the non-competitive infinite inflation. Basically, at this point Ethereum is a giant game of Hot Potato. You want to find the Greater Fool and sell him all your ether, because the token itself is now firmly in the "shitcoin" category after the whole DAO fiasco.
So, yeah. Ethereum is a private company running a quasi-blockchain, which is basically just a really expensive, not-very-powerful, and really error-prone Virtual Machine that fails to demonstrate objectivity in execution or immutability of state changes.

I never suggested such. However, it does seem like you haven't understood any of the points I have raised. That isn't to say that you are incapable of doing so, if you try; it just seems like you haven't put in the effort to understand yet. Which is fine! I'm just trying to help if you're interested in enriching your perspective.
**In particular, do you understand what I mean when I say: the relevant "natural bottleneck" here would be "UTXO processing-cost externalization factor"?**
Again, judging from your comments here, this appears to be the critical insight that you are missing at this time. And I am happy to elaborate on this if you'd like. I didn't understand this stuff at first, either.


I haven't been making any predictions here, just providing an overview of the vulnerabilities that are addressed by a 1MB limit, from an engineering standpoint. I don't feel that I have been vague at any point, but if you have questions and would like specific points clarified, I am more than happy to oblige! 


I am explaining the merits of the 1MB blocksize limit, because it appears that you are unaware that there are such merits. In so doing, I have contrasted the status quo with an alternative situation, in which the blocksize is completely unbounded. This is standard practice when assessing a particular system or subcomponent, not an attack against some suggestion.

What interpretation of the whitepaper? I haven't been interpreting the whitepaper at all here. Most of the references I've been making have been to direct quotes of Satoshi (like on the crypto mailing list), not excerpts of the whitepaper.
If you're really this confused, I think it might be time to take a giant step back and question your (numerous) assumptions. 


You are wrong. Satoshi explicitly described how the system would survive long-term, and laid the foundation for how Bitcoin will evolve over time. All of us (or at least all of us who have taken the time to educate ourselves) are well aware of this, and have been operating under this model the entire time. 
Do you realize here that you're essentially just proclaiming your own ignorance? You're basically saying "I don't understand how Bitcoin is supposed to work, but I think it should work this way!" which is in direct contradiction to the model which every reasonably-informed user has understood and worked under.
I'll leave you alone, if you want, because you probably feel very insulted right now, and I don't want to hurt your feelings unnecessarily. But I hope you realize that you have giant gaps in your knowledge, and very very elementary misunderstandings, which are going to leave you very frustrated and confused if you don't take some time to educate yourself and develop an accurate understanding of this technology. I'm willing to help you learn, if you want, but I'd understand your reluctance (no one likes to learn that they know almost-nothing about a subject they've been interested in for a while!), and it's no big deal to me.
Just let me know if you'd like to learn more. If you have an open mind, it wouldn't take long to figure all this stuff out properly.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:22:41

The purpose of SegWit is to increase *capacity*.
The blocksize is just one component of capacity. As a variable, we actually want the blocksize to be minimized; the smaller, the better. We want *capacity* to be maximized (the more capacity, the better).

The TL;DR (if you don't actually care about the specific discussions and proposals that have taken place) is that no solutions are going to manifest overnight. Much like the Internet itself, the usability, convenience, and utility is going to gradually evolve over the course of years and decades. Any friction you perceive right now represents an opportunity for an entrepreneur to concentrate on, improve, and profit from.
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:46:12
If you read the thread that your link is from, the context of the actual quote that you are (perhaps deliberately) misrepresenting was Jeff Garzik arguing against implementing the blocksize limit in the first place, on the grounds that it *could never possibly be removed or increased once it was put into place*. Satoshi responded by saying that it conceivably *could* be increased, if it ever needed to be, by including **an extremely long (i.e. multiple years in advance) activation period** and sending out a network alert regarding the upgrade. He never once said "this is the right way to scale" or even hinted that he thought so; he was merely rebutting the notion that such an increase was an impossibility due to the coordination it would require to safely perform. In fact, Satoshi said on multiple occasions that he expected (and even supported) Bitcoiners becoming "increasingly tyrannical" about limiting the size of the blockchain with such limits, in order to keep the costs of network onboarding to a minimum.
Furthermore, read his last ever post to BitcoinTalk. Notice what he considers Bitcoin's biggest remaining vulnerability to be? Or are you going to bury your head in the sand for that one?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:05:50
Read Section 11 of the whitepaper carefully:


chain. **Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes**, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. **An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.**
Once you understand this paragraph, you will understand Bitcoin *much* better than you do right now.
Again, if the rules were just "whatever the guy with the most computers says, goes" then Bitcoin wouldn't be interesting (or valuable) at all.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:43:21
Please try re-reading the whitepaper in full. All "attacker" means is "hashpower contributor acting selfishly" which translates to: any miner. 
As Satoshi [later said](


Please, instead of trying to reflexively *argue*, take a step back and consider the possibility that your previous understanding of the system was incorrect. 
Satoshi made it *very* clear (both in the whitepaper and in his later writings, as well as the code itself) that Bitcoin isn't merely "as long as you have more proof of work then you get to change the rules however you please"; that wouldn't be an interesting nor valuable construct. Bitcoin is much more elegant than that.
I'm trying to help you to see this, but you're intent on arguing rather than learning. Seriously, take a step back and consider things fairly.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:24:03
No, we actually know (from Satoshi directly) that the 1MB blocksize limit was not intended to mitigate microtransactional spam attacks. The minrelaylimit (a local node policy, rather than a consensus limit) was implemented as a protection against spam attacks (and according to Satoshi, it was "a first try" in terms of addressing this, even though it was implemented *after* the 1MB limit was in place).
What you're repeating is a myth and is part of a larger (quite malicious) propaganda campaign. Try to do your own research on these things, a lot of altcoin proponents do their very best to make things confusing and mislead people like you.

Now you're pretending like everyone here is claiming "it's the second coming of Christ", which is **the exact opposite** of what many of them claim is happening over here.
In reality, some people here have expressed support of the project rather mildly, some have (perhaps justifiably) criticized it as unimportant from most users' perspectives, and others have criticized it on trust-tradeoff grounds. **No one** has claimed it's anything like the second coming of Christ; it's rbtc that is notorious for that kind of cult-like exaggeration.

Quotes from Satoshi Nakamoto:
“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.”   – 2008
“At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010
"The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” – 2010

When the graph spans multiple *orders of magnitude*, using a logarithmic scale makes more sense, because it portrays percentage changes equivalently.
Going from $0.01 to $0.10 is the same as going from $100 to $1000, from an investment standpoint. Log scale shows this nicely. But in intervals where the price remains in a single order of magnitude (like when it goes from $2700 to $4300) linear scale can be more appropriate.
In any case, there is no "one size fits all" answer. Visualize the data however you personally prefer.

The rules are in the sidebar. To answer your questions directly:


Arguments can't be "banned", only accounts can. If someone is not advocating a contentious hard fork or altcoin, and if they are abiding by the other community rules here (and not simply outright trolling) then they will not be banned and they will be able to participate in civilized and open discussion on for as long as they want to. It's pretty simple, really.


Arguments can't be "banned", only accounts can. SegWit is part of Bitcoin now, so it might be worth acknowledging that being "pro-Bitcoin" necessarily implies being pro-SegWit at this point, too. 
In any case, people are free to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of SegWit to their heart's content here. If they're not trolling, their comments will not be removed.
Unfortunately, the reality is that the people who oppose SegWit are (almost without exception) anti-Bitcoin trolls who are just here to stir up drama. Their noise isn't welcome here.
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:29:29
That is one possible way forward, yes. Of course, you would also have to plug up a number of vulnerabilities (e.g. regarding sighash operations) to ensure the change isn't systemically dangerous, reach community and developer consensus on the hard-fork change to mitigate chain split risks, spend a significant amount of time testing and reviewing the changes made, and finally provide ample lead time (a year at absolute minimum) for the network to upgrade before the rule change took effect. And it is far from clear that a hard-fork blocksize increase would be beneficial for the network. There are very few solid arguments for such a change, at least that I've seen. But it is a possibility, of course.

Let's be honest, though. They're going to have to learn this the hard way. The smarter ones are certainly not going to be able to fool themselves forever, and they'll start quietly heading for the exit, but a lot more people are going to get served a brutal education.

What incentive is there to use SegWit on Litecoin, where blocks aren't even close to full and no meaningful fee competition exists? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:59:55


That's not actually what happened. **Parity** had the bug, but also had the majority hashrate. In the time it took for the bug to be discovered and sufficiently understood, Parity had already established a block lead. They decided to *add the bug to geth to arrive back in consensus with Parity*.
...which actually does a great job of illustrating the point that it is amateur hour over in Ethereum...

This shows a serious misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is and how it works. Your node, mining or not, abides by the consensus rules it is programmed to. Someone(s) had to program those rules. In a sense, developers are then more critical for consensus than miners.
If your node is set up to adhere to the consensus rules of Bitcoin, it will *never* accept a block granting a 100BTC coinbase reward, no matter how much hashpower is dedicated to the chain containing that block. It's invalid, period.
The Bitcoin whitepaper makes it very clear that miners are (intentionally) powerless to "throw the system open to arbitrary changes" because full nodes automatically reject such attempts. That is the foundation of Bitcoin.
If you don't understand that, you won't get very far and you're going to become very confused, very fast. If you *do* understand it, everything will start to make a whole lot more sense.

SegWit is about increasing capacity. Increasing the blocksize is just one way that it does so.
Fact is, there isn't a safe or sane proposal to increase the blocksize via hard-fork. Ask yourself why this is. 
Supporting legacy transaction formats and significantly increasing the space that these transactions can occupy in a block opens up numerous attack vectors that don't exist with the current blocksize cap. Are you able to list these attack vectors out? And crucially, are you able to present a convincing argument that these are the *only possible* attack and risk vectors that such a hard fork might incur? Do you have comprehensive strategy for contending with the technical issues and implications for such an increase?
If so, you need to write that proposal up and get it circulated, because we would all love to see it. 
But right now, there's only *one* sane blocksize increase on the table, which avoids introducing new risk vectors (like mentioned above) by only granting access to this additional space via transactions of a *new and improved format*. 
This is the only proposal, *so far*, that makes any sense. It is a capacity increase, and a literal blocksize increase, but the additional blocksize is reserved for those who are willing to format their transactions in an efficient and network-friendly format which wouldn't wreak technical havoc nodes (beyond the inevitable extra bandwidth and storage requirements demanded by *any* upscale-oriented capacity increase). It doesn't alter the fundamental consensus model of Bitcoin, and doesn't hurt anyone who isn't able to (or doesn't want to) make use of the new features/space. 
As far as I can tell, the only "alternative" to SegWit, if it can be termed as such, is BU. From a consensus perspective, BU is a radical departure from the Bitcoin model as designed and written by Satoshi. It has many known flaws and problems, and the general approach seems to be "add more complexity to obfuscate the problems" as far as I can see. The consensus model has never been tested on an altcoin. The one testnet that ran BU accidentally forked and was subsequently shut down.
Beyond that, BU is an opaque project with a shady governance model, funded by unknown actors, which doesn't appear to have a single competent developer (I've seen giant memory leak vulnerabilities committed into their master branch on numerous separate occasions; their lead dev tried to write a "Core makes mistakes too" critique a few months back and accidentally ended up revealing that he didn't understand any of the code he reviewed, had *actually unwittingly introduced one of the bugs he was critiquing*, and obliviously talked shit about some comment made by Satoshi). 
So, there's essentially one blocksize increase proposal available right now, and one altcoin run by amateurs that is masquerading as a blocksize increase proposal. **As of this moment, SegWit is the only sane blocksize increase that has been developed. Beyond that, it is the only one that has been reviewed and tested.**

There can be only 2 stickied posts in a subreddit at any given time. Bitcoin is seeing a large influx of new users right now, so the Beginners' FAQ is pretty much inviolate. That means that it's a choice between stickying this worthwhile warning and stickying a general catch-all Price Thread.

What do you mean "artificial"? If the 1MB limit is artificial, then so is the entire Bitcoin consensus construct. There's nothing more "artificial" about the 1MB blocksize limit than there is about the 21M coin cap limit.
To answer your question, though: I definitely agree that a blocksize limit must exist. Otherwise the system is vulnerable to all sorts of DoS attacks and other (more nuanced) attacks. 
The limit does not necessarily have to be 1MB (in fact, SegWit would increase it to around 4MB with a straightforward and safe soft fork). There's nothing particularly magical about the "1MB" figure except that it is the existing consensus setting and that the (known) attack vectors mentioned above are not fatal within the established 1MB bounds, thanks in no small part to the extraordinary engineering efforts of Core over the past 3 or 4 years. I would be perfectly happy to see this figure increase, provided it was done safely and with the risk vectors thoroughly contemplated and addressed.

Satoshi said that the blocksize limit had *nothing* to do with spam, when the minrelayfee was being discussed a couple of months later. The "blocksize limit is just a protection against spam" meme is very frustrating to see repeated all the time, considering how contradicted by history it is.
This, too, is a misrepresentation of Satoshi:


In that thread, Satoshi is **explicitly saying not to try to implement a blocksize increase without network-wide consensus**. In fact, *he takes theymos' side over Jeff Garzik's!* He **strongly** discourages any such  modifications before the network needs such a change, and his "it can be phased in" comment is clearly him explaining that "Hard forks are not impossible, they just require *extreme* coordination in order to safely implement."

Yes, we are in You seem to be *whoosh*ing rather badly, so pay attention here...
If you are in a movie theater while a movie is playing, and you stand up and start shouting your political beliefs, you will be ejected from the theater. In no way does that represent you being "prohibited from expressing your political beliefs". You're simply disobeying the rules of the venue you are in, and are not welcome in that venue. No prohibition has taken place.
This subreddit is a private venue, like it or not. The same principles apply. The management is able to set the rules for their private venue and remove rulebreakers as they see fit. None of this is prohibiting your speech *in any way*, nor can it be construed as such.
*Furthermore*, you can discuss *any ideas you want in That's not actually against the rules, and I personally have discussed pretty much all things Bitcoin here, without issue. What you cannot do is *promote consensus-breaking contentious hard-forks*, which is a very clear and very reasonable rule. 
So, let's recap: you can discuss whatever you want, you just can't *promote* software that is network-hostile. And beyond that, *even if you couldn't discuss whatever you want here* (and, again, you can), it wouldn't represent "prohibition of speech" in the slightest!

Once you spend from an address (regardless of whatever chain you're doing the spending on) you expose the public key for that address (rather than simply a hash derived from that public key, which is what the address itself represents).
This represents a marginal drop in security for any coins that remain at that address after the transaction is complete, because you are now relying solely on ECDSA security rather than the security of ECDSA *plus* the hash function involved. 
In other words, spending BCash will generally expose public key(s) on the real Bitcoin chain, which adversely affects the security of the Bitcoin addresses involved.
For large amounts like this, moving the funds (on both chains) to new addresses is prudent.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:52:57
No, not at all. If Bitcoin relied on consistent price doublings every four years, it would be demonstrably doomed and none of us would be here wasting our time with it. 
The point is that the reward subsidy is phased out and replaced by the transaction fees. Those fees are *necessary* for Bitcoin's incentives to work. **That** is what we've known since 2008, and the key insight that you are missing.

If there is a meaningful disagreement regarding the changing of consensus rules, then the consensus rules that have already been agreed upon represent Bitcoin, and any deviation represents an altcoin ("not Bitcoin").
Basically, Bitcoin is designed to be *very hard* to change. That's one of the biggest points. By default, in situations where there is a divide in opinion, the status quo wins. 
Those who don't like the status quo (in other words, those who don't want to be a part of Bitcoin) are free to launch their own competing coin and try to win in the open market. But they can't honestly call themselves "Bitcoin" because that's not what they are. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, other coins are not.

The entire point payment channels (which is what Lightning Network is a "network" of) is that they are *cryptographically secure*. To use your "check/bank-account" analogy, a Lightning Network payment would be equivalent to a check accompanied by a cryptographic proof of the corresponding balance in the sender's bank account as well as a cryptographic signature guaranteeing sole ownership of that balance.

So much wrong with this comment, it's hard to know where to start. I'll skip the drivel about Ferraris... not sure if you were trying to make a point there or just daydreaming about cars.




This is *one* of the many purposes it serves. Satoshi did not explain his own personal rationale behind implementing the limit, not even when he was defending the limit's existence (which, as I'm sure you must know, he did). It is commonly understood to be a DoS protection mechanism (preventing a variety of vulnerabilities, ranging from mere transactional spam to elaborate constructions involving poisonously high-sigop transactions that could fundamentally undermine competitive Bitcoin mining) as well as a mechanism to limit the processing costs of the blockchain (of which total size i.e. disk usage is just one component).
On *many* separate occasions, Satoshi explained that he supported Bitcoiners ardently fighting to limit the size of the blockchain (and the type of data it hosts), and he wisely predicted that we would (and apparently, according to him, *should*) get "increasingly tyrannical" about limiting the size of the chain (so as to minimize processing/onboarding costs). This is well-documented, indisputable fact. I am not making an appeal to authority here, so much as highlighting that *you* are arguing that we should stray from Satoshi's vision.


You still *do* have to run a full node to truly trustlessly participate in the Bitcoin network. The SPV scheme described in the whitepaper hasn't actually been successfully implemented yet; in short, the lite clients as originally-envisioned have yet to manifest. I have no doubt that one day they *will*, but right now, if you're using a "lightweight" client, you're actually placing trust in a counterparty. This is perfectly reasonable behavior in many scenarios and contexts, but if almost everyone does this, the fundamental foundation of Bitcoin is threatened; its peer-to-peer nature would be subverted and the assumptions it operates under violated. This would inexorably erode all value from the network, if it were to happen. In other words, "Bitcoin can work fine if we just rely on trust rather than cryptography" is not actually true, and shows a deep misunderstanding of the subject on your part.

Yes. It is the highest volume for *any* global p2p remote value transfer network at this time, in fact. By at least an order of magnitude. 
Also, Satoshi's prediction that you're clinging to mentions "In 20 years", not "In 7 years", so we're not even halfway there yet. Mayhaps it's a little soon to be declaring that Satoshi was wrong like you are here. Be patient.


He was in favor of *keeping Bitcoin usable* which means keeping the costs of participation reasonably low. To do this, the bandwidth, storage, and processing costs of synching the blockchain have to be minimized. This is an engineering fact, and it is one Satoshi understood very well. Satoshi put the blocksize limit there in the first place. Are you able to appreciate the reasons why? And are you able to see that these same reasons still apply just as well (or better) today?


It is so strange to me that you people are so hell-bent on corrupting Bitcoin away from Satoshi's vision. Satoshi explicitly said alternate (out-of-consensus) clients would **never** be a good idea, and would be a "menace to the network". In other words, BU is as anti-Satoshi's-vision as it gets. Satoshi said he thought Bitcoin users should be "tyrannical" about limiting the data costs of blockchain growth. Satoshi put the blocksize limit into Bitcoin and defended it remaining in place when opposition was voiced against it. Satoshi described payment channels when he was asked how "high frequency trading" could be carried out on a network with the scaling and block time interval properties of Bitcoin. Satoshi explicitly described how critical it was that in his design of Bitcoin, a supermajority of miners would still *never* be able to spend others' coins that they do not have the private keys for (whereas BU allows a majority collusion of miners to spend others' coins). Satoshi even explained his design rationale for Script; he wanted it to be adaptable, so that newer transaction versions could be deployed and older nodes which did not upgrade would still remain in consensus (even if they don't understand the specifics of the newer tx info), which is a *perfect* description of SegWit as implemented as a soft fork.
Do you see what I'm saying here? It is obvious and undeniable that Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core, and that (at least according to Satoshi) BU is anathema to Bitcoin.

Same with Bitcoin. You can fork it all you want. You can even try to call your fork "Bitcoin" (though that is simply counterfeiting and fraud). But fortunately, by running a Bitcoin node (or communicating with a machine that does so), anyone can trivially detect counterfeit Bitcoins for what they are, and tell them apart from real Bitcoins.

You are fundamentally confused, it seems. A hard fork without consensus just represents the creation of an altcoin. That's not politics, that's just a recognition of how Bitcoin consensus works, on a technical level.
If you understand the above (which you evidently do not), all the mental gymnastics you're forcing yourself to go through suddenly dissipate, and the reasoning of Bitcoin's developers becomes much more clear. 
Let me ask you this: in terms of requesting replay protections to be merged into Bitcoin Core, what do you argue these should look like? Are you proposing a hard fork to modify the transaction format entirely? If so, you are saying "Hey Bitcoin developers, will you kill Bitcoin for me?" and then stamping your feet when they tell you "No".

Or would you rather have a few links where Satoshi talks about how Bitcoiners can (and should) work towards keeping the size of the blockchain as small and manageable as possible, to minimize the costs of network onboarding?


You actually don't know that for a fact, because Satoshi never said any such thing. Read my comment above. The *only* time Satoshi ever discussed the possibility of a hard-fork increase in the maximum blocksize limit was in the context that I described above.

I made no such claim. I asked a question. If you (or anyone else) took a moment to try to answer the question I asked, you would *immediately* understand the point that was being made. 
Instead you shouted "Proof?! Proof?! Where's your proof?" like a seagull from Finding Nemo. 
I'll try again. The poster to whom I asked the question originally said that cleaning up obvious shilling is acceptable moderation, but that removing 80% of the comments in a given thread is censorship, implying (or arguably even explicitly claiming) that there is a necessary distinction between the two. I then asked a very simple question, to demonstrate the inadequacy of this argument: what about in cases where 80% of the comments *are* obvious shilling? 
It doesn't matter whether any such examples have even occurred in the entire history of this subreddit, because the point is that *the two aren't mutually exclusive*. If you're even able to *imagine* a thread where the majority of the comments are part of an obvious shill brigade, then my point stands strong.

The more you write the more clear it is that you're either lying or you don't understand this stuff *at all*.
New blocks can be much larger than 1MB with segregated witness data. You didn't know that?


Uh, the "actual block" includes the witness data. 
You need to do a *lot* of reading. You clearly have huuuge gaps in your knowledge and many misconceptions. If you want to learn more, you can always ask me questions. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:40:45


The relevant "natural bottleneck" here would be "UTXO processing-cost externalization factor". If you do not understand what I mean by that (in other words, if that combination of words leaves you confused rather than making you say, "Oh, I see what you mean! Good point!") please let me know, because that appears to be the critical insight that you are missing at this time.


Yes. But that's not relevant to what I'm talking about. This is akin to saying "Can't we get attacked by soldiers on land? Then let's discontinue all naval-based defenses!" There are many ways to DoS attack a network like Bitcoin. The 1MB limit protects against a large class of such attacks, but by no means all of them.


No, not the type of DoS attack that I am referring to. The DoS attacks that would be possible with a totally-unbounded blocksize at this time would be potentially *fatal*; they would represent systemic threats to Bitcoin itself (rather than a minor and temporary inconvenience to users of Bitcoin who desire as-fast-as-possible transaction confirmation). 


There must be a continual and persistent transaction backlog in the mempool, otherwise mining incentives break over long time horizons. Beyond that, I would like as many people as possible to enjoy as low of fees as possible for as quick of confirmations as possible, without endangering the value-added that Bitcoin provides in the first place. It is entirely conceivable that this could entail pricing out the vast majority of the population from layer-one security privileges for the bulk of their financial transactions. If that is what it takes to keep Bitcoin from being fundamentally compromised, I am perfectly fine with it (the alternative would be a long-term, fractal death of the system and a corresponding decline in the token's value). Fortunately it looks like it won't be so bad as all that, but it's an eventuality that I would be okay with, if that's what it comes down to.


Why do you want to change the 1MB figure? It is a good thing. It is helping Bitcoin. If you are not able to understand this fact, of course reality is going to confuse and frustrate you. The solution here is not to ignore the benefits of the limit entirely (and vehemently pretend there are none), the solution is to do the necessary research that it takes to understand both sides of the issue, and then revisit your questions and initial assumptions as needed.

You mean the fee market that Satoshi said would gradually replace block rewards over time as the incentive mechanism powering Bitcoin? That's not some recent machination of Core's, that has literally been the plan since the day the whitepaper was released.
"Oh but it's too early for a fee market!" you'll inevitably respond, conveniently neglecting to provide any supportive arguments for *why* it is too early, and what precise date you would prefer the fee market to suddenly manifest and why. 
You're probably not even running a full node, let's be honest. And yet you're arguing that every overtly-wasteful SatoshiDice transaction (and any other such insanely stupid usages that are enabled by a zero-marginal-inclusion-cost blockspace paradigm) belongs on the blockchain, severely slowing down and painig anyone who wants to use Bitcoin trustlessly. Just stop.


What a joke of a statement. By *any* metric, the quantity and quality of progress of Bitcoin Core as a development organization are orders of magnitude greater than any other organizations even *tangentially* related to the industry. No other teams come even *close*. 
By making such a radically ignorant statement, you've identified yourself as a hostile actor and a troll. You've discredited any points you were hoping to make, because you forgot to water your lies down a little bit with the truth, like any clever liar would do.

The real issue is that it inhibits covert ASICBOOST, which we now know Bitmain has spent vast amounts of capital to implement, patent, and protect. 
SegWit fixes an exploit that Bitmain have been taking advantage of for some time. *That's* what made the upgrade controversial.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:46:26
It's overwhelmingly likely (though not quite inevitable) that the blocksize cap is considerably lifted (or allowed to float/slide) at some point in Bitcoin's future. I definitely agree with you on that.
The only point I was trying to make was that the blocksize itself is not something we want to increase for its own sake. It is a means to an end (capacity), and we know many ways that capacity can be improved (and many of these are safer and provide more benefits than raw blocksize increases, especially at this stage in Bitcoin's life). It seems like you understand all that, though, so we're not really disagreeing on anything here. I apologize if I took a hostile tone with you throughout the conversation.

It's the same answer for the moderators of this subreddit and the wider community as a whole.
In fact, when I go over the list of moderators here, there's not a *single* username on there that doesn't deserve respect (I would even argue myself included). I suspect that the *only* complaints that you have about anyone's character on that short list is: "They volunteer some of their free time to try their best to clean up one of the biggest online Bitcoin communities in the world, so that quality discussion can take place without being drowned out by a wall of hateful noise." That's not exactly damning.

Segwit gained consensus through the Bitcoin community's nearly-universal support. It was the only proposal that the wider developer/technical community supported, it used a 95% miner activation threshold (which it achieved), and was activated at the behest of a grassroots movement (the UASF), which also achieved Segwit activation in Vertcoin and Litecoin shortly before in Bitcoin. In each case, the mining pools weren't signaling for Segwit activation until the UASF deadlines were imminent, at which time they **rapidly** started signaling for it (usually desperately organizing a meaningless and farcical "meeting" or "roundtable" to pretend like this was their decision and "save face", despite the fact that empirically speaking, such meetings are notoriously impotent when it comes to Bitcoin upgrades).
The fact that Segwit allowed for gradual adoption (rather than being an overnight economic "shock") was one of the many benefits it offered relative to other proposals.
Without intending to be rude, it sounds like you don't have a solid understanding of most of what you're trying to comment about. May I suggest asking more questions until you feel more informed on these subjects?

You, in true "desperate troll" fashion, tried to change the subject with the following argument: "If Core is so terrified about losing users to altcoins, they should launch an altcoin to compete!"
No one is terrified about losing users, of course. People are free to buy or use whatever alts they want, and those of us who have been around for a long time fully understand this. But more importantly, the idea to "Fight shitcoin fire with shitcoin fire" is an embarrassingly bad idea, so much so that it's hard to believe that you are seriously suggesting it.

The problem, [as I already explained upthread]( is that Roger Ver (and others, I'm sure) are *regularly paying to socially attack this subreddit and community*. The hundreds (or thousands) of 0-hour-old accounts constantly brigading this subreddit to make divisive drama-centric shitposts are just *one* tendril of this campaign (which has been pretty relentlessly ongoing for multiple years now). If these weren't filtered out, this place would be totally unreadable. 
The problem isn't the moderation (in fact, that's the only thing keeping so much better in terms of quality discussion than Ver's subreddit)... the problem is the hostile actors who professionally abuse reddit as a platform.
Once again (and this time in bold because you seem intent on ignoring the point): **if you are upset with how things are, the person who you should probably speak to is Roger Ver, who seems to be one of the principal financiers of the divide-and-conquer efforts we've had to deal with over the past few years.**

Yes, of course not. Which is further evidence/proof of the fact that he wasn't relying on the assumption of a continual 4-year price-doubling, as you argued before. Do you see what I am saying here?


Satoshi was indeed planning for Bitcoin's price to grow over time, and he was indeed planning to have the fee market steadily replace the block reward subsidy for mining incentives over the lifetime of the network. He said so dozens of times, in fact. Even on the day he released the whitepaper he was saying these things. This was the plan for Bitcoin all along, and was no secret.


Yes, and we still do. Us "old-timers" definitely understand Bitcoin's potential and we are steadily being proven right as it keeps growing over the years. Satoshi had a brilliant idea; now we're seeing it through.

SegWit isn't a second implementation, it is a transaction version upgrade. If you click the link in my above comment, and read Satoshi's explanation of his design for Script, he clearly lays out that he set it up so that fancy soft-forked transaction version updates like SegWit can roll out without harming consensus in any way, allowing old nodes to safely ignore the new transaction version details, and that he supports this type of upgrade.
According to Satoshi, BU is a menace to the network, and SegWit is a great example of a healthy network upgrade. Read the link to confirm this fact.

In poker, there is a phenomenon known as "going on tilt", where someone (who might normally be a talented poker player) gets flustered and/or burnt out by the situation they find themselves in at the table, and every subsequent action they take manages to hurt them even more. The worst part about being on tilt is that you usually aren't able to pull yourself away from the table and take a break (even if you know that it would be a wise move!) and more often than not, tilted players end up losing their entire stash and walking away extremely disappointed, frustrated, and chipless.
Your comments here remind me of a poker player on tilt. Even when you're explicitly told that you're embarrassing yourself, even after you've been caught in a lie and made a fool of in the process, even when it's clear that every approach you take just digs your hole that much deeper, you can't seem to pull yourself out of it. You keep going. Somewhere inside of you is probably a tiny voice, whispering that maybe it's time to cut your losses and walk away, but you can't seem to let it go, even though you're just making it worse and worse.
It sucks to be on tilt. Good luck on getting out of it, bud. I'll leave you with one last piece of advice, as a parting gift: do your best to realize what you know and what you do not, and in situations where the discussion is revolving around one of the things that you do *not* understand, keep your mouth shut and your ears open. Ignorance is usually obvious, and you don't do yourself any favors by pretending to know more than you actually do.

This is a textbook example of something known as "Moving the Goalposts" and it is actually a fairly common argumentative fallacy.

Exactly why we don't want to naively hard fork it and just hope for the best!


Uh, no. When Satoshi was first asked how "high frequency trading" could possibly occur on a network like Bitcoin, he explicitly described payment channels. He obviously thought the right way to scale was with smart advancements like that, considering *he came up with them for this exact reason*, and even talked about how he designed Script from the beginning to be able to perform such activities. You are misrepresenting a quote of Satoshi's when you say he "thought the right way to scale was to increase the block size"; the context of the actual quote that you are (perhaps deliberately) misrepresenting was Jeff Garzik arguing against implementing the blocksize limit in the first place, on the grounds that it *could never possibly be removed or increased once it was put into place*. Satoshi responded by saying that it conceivably *could* be increased, if it ever needed to be, by including **an extremely long (i.e. multiple years in advance) activation period** and sending out a network alert regarding the upgrade. He never once said "this is the right way to scale" or even hinted that he thought so; he was merely rebutting the notion that such an increase was an impossibility due to the coordination it would require to safely perform. In fact, Satoshi said on multiple occasions that he expected (and even supported) Bitcoiners becoming "increasingly tyrannical" about limiting the size of the blockchain with such limits, in order to keep the costs of network onboarding to a minimum.
It is a ridiculous lie to say Satoshi "thought the right way to scale was to increase the block size and hard forks" and anyone who is willing to lie that badly deserves to be treated with great skepticism, if not hostility.


It will certainly stop working if we break it (a la "Bitcoin" Unlimited)! Furthermore, the *actual* argument (rather than the weird strawman you chose to erect here) is that O(N²) broadcast networks inherently incur higher costs in some respects than other architectures and models, especially as N reaches meaningfully large values. This is not really a debatable opinion, this is a fact, as anyone with a degree (or even a few classes' worth of experience) in Computer Science can explain to you.


You keep arguing that Satoshi was wrong, all the while revealing that you don't understand the engineering of the system he designed. It's a bit ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-06-25 05:14:48
Not really... I haven't met anyone who is pro-ether and also truly intelligent. I wouldn't go so far as to say the two are mutually exclusive, but there's certainly a *very* strong negative correlation.
The level of intelligence in Bitcoin Core is many orders of magnitude greater than those behind the DAO. 
For God's sake, *there were multiple reports on DAO vulnerabilities reported in research papers well before any attacks took place*. They were patently ignored. That sort of thing doesn't fly in Bitcoin. Or at least, it hasn't yet.
No offense intended by any of this.

I think you raise some good points, and I agree with most of what you said. On the other hand, consider the fact that Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com, the  handle on Twitter, the r**btc** subreddit, and plenty of other high-profile Bitcoin-related IP, which he shamelessly uses to trash-talk the real Bitcoin in the continual attempt to promote his favorite altcoin.
Roger Ver is a blight on Bitcoin, not only because he is wealthy, determined, and *incredibly* unscrupulous, but because he enjoys ridiculous privilege with respect to online Bitcoin namespaces. Fortunately I don't believe he is anywhere near cunning enough to pose a "real threat" to Bitcoin, so he's positioned himself as basically an annoying bump-in-the-road... but just because he isn't *fatal* doesn't mean we should ignore the damage he does (or has the power to do).
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:50:12


In what way?
SegWit is just a new (optional) transaction format which relocates the witness data bytes to the end of transaction during serialization. This has a ton of benefits (you can prune out witness data on the fly, transaction malleability is cleanly avoidable, [new-and-improved address types]( become possible, etc). It also increases the blocksize without risking a chain split or any consensus breaking, and arguably improves scalability over the long term in many ways.
I think SegWit is clearly in line with the "technical spirit" of Bitcoin. I'd be interested to hear why you disagree, though.
Satoshi even recommended that upgrades to Bitcoin be done SegWit-style. For instance, he pretty much says "From the very beginning, I designed Bitcoin so that cool new transaction upgrades (like SegWit) can be rolled out as soft forks" in [this comment](

BU is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:05:25
Sure thing.
The softfork version of SegWit requires less lines of code. It is conceptually simpler than a hard-forked version. It is actually implemented (and reviewed, and tested). It does not break legacy-style nLockTime'd transactions. It does not pose the threat of a network split (and the risks that would entail).
A hard-forked version would require more code to cover edge-cases. It would potentially break legacy-style nLockTime'd transactions. It would risk a network split. And most importantly, **there is no hard-forked implementation written**, much less tested, so there is no realistic way to say that it would be a "cleaner" or "better" way to do things.
Every argument against a soft-forked SegWit actually applies equally well (or moreso!) to a hard-forked SegWit.

My source is Satoshi himself. 
[Satoshi said]( *very* early on, in response to theymos' asking "Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?":


Here you can see that Satoshi *explicitly* mentions "a few decades" and "20 years" as the relevant time horizons over which the transition from block-reward-subsidy to fee-based incentives occurs. 
From the above, we can know that Satoshi would consider the gradual transition to a fee market (like what we have begun to see) is perfectly healthy and expected at this time. He designed Bitcoin to do exactly that.
The worst deception "big blockers" are guilty of is constantly misrepresenting a quote of Satoshi's when they say he "thought the right way to scale was to increase the block size"; the context of [the actual quote that you are (perhaps deliberately) misrepresenting]( was Jeff Garzik arguing against implementing the blocksize limit in the first place, on the grounds that it *could never possibly be removed or increased once it was put into place*. Satoshi responded by saying that it conceivably *could* be increased, if it ever needed to be, by including **an extremely long (i.e. multiple years in advance) activation period** and sending out a network alert regarding the upgrade. He never once said "this is the right way to scale" or even hinted that he thought so; he was merely rebutting the notion that such an increase was an impossibility due to the coordination it would require to safely perform. In fact, Satoshi said on multiple occasions that he expected (and even supported) Bitcoiners becoming "increasingly tyrannical" about limiting the size of the blockchain with such limits, in order to keep the costs of network onboarding to a minimum.
Furthermore, when Satoshi was first asked how "high frequency trading" could possibly occur on a network like Bitcoin, [he explicitly described payment channels]( He obviously thought the right way to scale was with smart advancements like that, considering *he came up with them for this exact reason*, and even talked about how he designed Script from the beginning to be able to perform such activities.
It is a ridiculous lie to say Satoshi "thought the right way to scale was to increase the block size and hard forks" and anyone who is willing to lie that badly deserves to be treated with great skepticism, if not hostility.
Also, [read his final post to BitcoinTalk]( Notice what he considers Bitcoin's biggest remaining vulnerability to be? Or are you going to bury your head in the sand for that one?


No, you can't verify that. I just proved the exact opposite. I never accused you of *understanding* Satoshi's vision, though.
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:33:52
Bitcoin doesn't need large blocks, at all. Bitcoin would benefit from increased *capacity*, yes, but simply increasing the size of blocks is the most brutish, reckless, and naive approach to doing so. 
We need *much* more data before we can confidently discuss what the optimal blocksize limit should be.

Luke-Jr was the one who figured out how to soft-fork SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:15:42
One of the best aspects of SegWit is that it's a soft fork...

That is discussion. This really isn't hard.
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:44:23
No, the "stripped" block is not what is added to the blockchain. The block is.
This is like enabling pruning on your node, and then saying, "Look the blockchain is only a couple of GB in size!" No, you just pruned out the full data.

Obviously he does. Your trolling attempt is transparent and lame.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:04:36


No, that's the beauty of soft-forks: they *don't* break from existing consensus rules. That's one of the biggest reasons why SegWit is so popular among Bitcoin developers; it works within the existing consensus framework, and doesn't break it at all (through careful engineering).
If a bunch of people get together and decide to play a game of baseball, and then midway through the game, some of them decide "You know what, let's play football instead!" then that would be analogous to a hard fork. Some of the people playing might not be interested in playing any more, because they agreed to play baseball, not football. The football advocates might argue that "Football is a better game than baseball, this is just an upgrade to our game!" but they can't reasonably demand that everyone must start playing football instead of baseball, and try to kick those who disagree off the field. The original agreement was to play baseball, after all.
If, on the other hand, midway through the game, a group of players decide "Hey, let's keep playing baseball, with the same old rules, but let's add a *new* rule (which each player is free to ignore if they want to): when you are running to a new base, you have to run backwards!" then this is analogous to a soft fork. There's nothing in the rules of baseball that prevents people from running backwards if they want to, so this isn't going to disrupt the game (though it sure might handicap the players who abide by the new rule). Players who don't agree to the new rule can keep playing baseball as they have been doing, and the same system of rules and scoring will still continue to work just fine. In fact, if they weren't paying close attention, *they might not even notice that some players are running backwards*, and they'd still get to keep playing the game that they originally agreed to play.
This doesn't mean that "all soft forks are good and all hard forks are bad" or anything like that. You can do all sorts of crazy stuff with a soft fork, plenty of which would be unambiguously detrimental to Bitcoin if successfully integrated. But, at least in *some* ways, a soft fork is categorically better than a hard fork, because it doesn't break from the existing consensus (and thus retains backwards compatibility).

It's actually equivalent to saying "The Electoral College endorsed Donald Trump as president" which is entirely accurate.


It's true.


Ah, you don't understand what "cash" means in these contexts (which isn't exactly surprising). It originates from [Chaum's work]( which was a precursor to Bitcoin (and referenced many times by Satoshi).
Not only are "cash" and "settlement system" *not* mutually exclusive, cash *is* a settlement system, by definition. 
You don't understand the terminology used by Satoshi because you haven't taken the time to investigate the definitions and etymology... and yet you try to make terminological arguments anyway. 
Honestly, you're embarrassing yourself more than you know with this nonsense.


Not only is it "debatable", it's flat-out refuted *in the whitepaper itself*. See Section 11:


That's the entire point of Bitcoin; no matter how much hashpower someone dedicates towards "controlling it", they have very little *actual* control of the system; they can select the ordering of transactions, and that's it. They don't get to redefine the consensus model; that would be a *completely* different design altogether. That wouldn't be *Bitcoin*.




Bitcoin is the property of Bitcoiners. I am a Bitcoiner. You, evidently, are not. I can say "We will defend our territory" and it is just as valid as saying "My family and I will defend our home against intruders"... I don't have to have a notarized contract including the signatures of my wife and children in order to make such a statement.

At no point did Alice think "this transaction isn't real", regardless of whatever attacks Bob is attempting. 
Beyond that, Alice is not going to relay the transaction at all, because it is nonstandard from her perspective. This doesn't mean she considers it invalid (if she sees it included in a block, she will still accept that block) but it does mean that she will not relay it before it is in a block. Bob does not benefit from "pretending to be Carol when sending to Alice" because Alice will ignore the transaction altogether until it is included (confirmed) in a block.
If it *does* get confirmed in a block, that means that more than 95% of miners have validated the witness portion of the transaction and decided the transaction was legit. Alice is in no more danger of being defrauded than with any other transaction in the blockchain, no matter what shenanigans Bob tried along the way.

You seem very confused on a number of fronts. For one, you can indeed exile people from a community (both in meatspace as well as online), and this is one of the most effective (and least violent) solutions that is used to deal with troublesome individuals that behave contrary to the greater societal good. Exile has been an effective technique throughout most of history.
Though you can't realistically silence those people without resorting to violence, fortunately that's not relevant to our discussion here, because no one is being silenced in any way that I can see.
The fact that Segwit achieved nearly-universal community support, however inconvenient it might be for your worldview, is the reality of the matter.


The 95% miner signaling came **just** in the nick of time for the UASF deadline, **exactly** like what happened on Vertcoin and Litecoin prior to August 2017. In all three cases, the mining pool representatives went from minority-signaling to supermajority-signaling **extremely** rapidly, after calling respective "roundtable meetings", and in all three cases this happened in line with the UASF timelines relevant to those chains.
Bitcoin has a long history of "roundtable meetings" that were called in the attempt to change or update its consensus code; **every single one** failed to achieve anything of the sort, **except** for the one that made the update demanded by the Segwit UASF. Ponder that for a moment.


Factually and objectively, we know that this is false, because Segwit has been successfully activated on plenty of coins through the UASF mechanism.


That seems highly unlikely, considering how uninformed you are and your account age.

There is SegWit, which is tested, released, and waiting for miner activation. Of course, that 23 cents you paid for your transaction fee goes straight to the miners, so they are understandably not as eager as you to get that figure reduced.

Basically, if your node asks "Hey man, give me block  please!" then my node will say "Alright, are you upgraded? Do you support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions. Yay.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you). 
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it.

Or could it be that you are uncomfortable after realizing that I have all the facts on my side and have aptly demonstrated this, and you're desperately trying to pretend like there's some sort of communication barrier so that you don't have to confront your own resultant cognitive dissonance?


You're right. I assumed that you were trying to argue that BU is a good idea based on the fact that you seem to be in favor of a hard fork blocksize increase. If you recognize that BU is anti-Bitcoin and the opposite of Satoshi's vision already, then I apologize for belaboring the point.


I'm not sure what this sentence is supposed to mean. Did you presume English isn't my first language because it isn't yours?


As I have explained many times, this quote was **not** Satoshi explaining how the network should upgrade. Again, go read the context of the quote. What it **was**, was Satoshi explaining to Jeff Garzik that such limits can conceivably be removed, despite the fact that they demand network-wide coordination, by giving a long (multi-year) lead time and an extraordinary effort to communicate the need to upgrade to the network nodes during that lead time. Seriously, go read the thread that this quote is from. Satoshi clearly isn't saying that the limit should be removed; he is defending it being there in the first place and rebutting the notion that its removal is a total impossibility.
So, once again, we have a Satoshi quote that supports what I've been saying.


Where did I say anything like this? I just showed you the transaction volume in Bitcoin, explained that this is the highest transaction volume of *any* cryptocurrency or p2p e-money, and explained that Satoshi's prediction that "In 20 years, there will either be very high volume or no volume at all" still has 13 years to come true.

From [the whitepaper]( itself:


Satoshi [also said]( *very* early on, in response to theymos' asking "Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?":


Here you can see that Satoshi *explicitly* mentions "a few decades" and "20 years" as the relevant time horizons over which the transition from block-reward-subsidy to fee-based incentives occurs. He is also explicitly acknowledging that the transition to a fee-based network is in order to protect the finitude of the network tokens.
This, alone, proves my point. 
I'll keep going, though, to give you plenty of references if you're interested in learning more about this.
[More from Satoshi on this subject](








transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value from 
any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client 
software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended 
payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive value 
when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in 
the block.


[Satoshi also said]( "There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by 
transaction fees alone" and "With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive." 
Moving past just Satoshi references (after all, this isn't an appeal-to-authority, I'm merely explaining how Bitcoin is envisioned to work over the long term, and demonstrating that this has been well understood in the community since the very beginning)...

There's no such thing as "accepting Lightning Network" because the Lightning Network is just bitcoins routed through payment channels. So the question you meant to ask is "How many coffee shops accept *Bitcoin*?"
Think of Bitcoin as analogous to [TCP/IP]( and the Lightning Network as [HTTP]( HTTP relies on TCP/IP, but it represents a different layer of the stack. 
You seem to be thinking of these things in terms of *different stacks* when really they are on *the same stack* but on *different layers*. Simple misunderstandings like this can hurt your perspective pretty badly if you leave them unchecked.

No, that's the entire point. It *doesn't* introduce a new layer of trust. It's just time-locked Bitcoin transactions. With Bitcoin, if you want to do things trustlessly, you run your own node, because the only machine you can really trust is your own.
This means that as long as you trust in Bitcoin Script, then using the Lightning Network doesn't incur any new trust vectors for you. Cryptographic security for the win!

They require a ridiculous level of precision. If you give me enough time, I can look at a protocol implementation and tell you, unambiguously, whether it is an instantiation of PAXOS, or of RAFT, or of a blockchain (and again, with enough time, I could tell you *which* blockchain it is)... or if it's none of the above.

Stringing fantasies together isn't an argument. If you're going to start with the assumption that Bitcoin dies, then yeah, okay, in that case Bitcoin dies.

Good points, but I've seen the argument made that any hypothetical SegWit exploits would be unprofitable on testnet, thus prompting attackers to refrain from attacking until mainnet activation.
I don't really think that's a particularly great argument or overriding concern, but I do recognize that the argument isn't absurd on its face; it makes some sense. An altcoin SegWit activation would, in a sense, function as a security bounty... by occurring on a network which transports actual value.
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:39:56


That argument is both *not something I have disputed in this thread of comments* and *not a semantic argument to begin with*.


Don't take my word for it. Go read [the actual thread that the quote is from]( to understand what Satoshi's suggestion was. It's a lot of reading that you will have to do, to understand and appreciate what Satoshi's feelings on the matter were (there was much discussion and debate before Satoshi shows up into the thread, which sets up the context of his contribution), but it's worth a read. 
There is no ambiguity about which side Satoshi takes in that discussion. You will appreciate it after you have done your homework.


No, you showed up in this thread saying that "a fee market is not what Satoshi intended" and (for an actual quote which demonstrates your grasp on the English language, or lack thereof, rather profoundly): ["i don't think you can **legitamtly** confuse what Satoshi's vision was."](
I then provided numerous citations demonstrating beyond any doubt that "Satoshi's vision" included a fee market to sustain Bitcoin mining incentives, and that the relevant timeline for this was a couple of decades (rather than a century, which was the original point of dispute). 
You continued to (incorrectly) argue, despite having been proven wrong on the matter, that Satoshi would have wanted to prevent a fee market. It's a well known fact that BU developers continually make assumptions of continual seigniorage in their modeling of Bitcoin economics, and that BU advocates discarding the legacy "validity" rules of Bitcoin consensus in favor of a blindly-follow-majority-hashrate model instead (which would, of course, allow continual inflation), which makes it perfectly reasonable to assume that you are advocating BU here. You're in favor of supporting perpetual Bitcoin inflation (just like BU advocates and developers) and seem to be discontent with Bitcoin Core and/or the SegWit blocksize increase (which BU adherents invariantly are); you pretty much fit the profile to a T.


I think you may have just not understood what it is that I'm saying (which is not surprising, given your apparently tenuous grasp on the English language in general). Allow me to explain.
Cognitive dissonance is "[the mental stress (discomfort) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, when performing an action that contradicts those beliefs, ideas, and values; or when confronted with new information that contradicts existing beliefs, ideas, and values]( Hopefully you are able to understand that definition (if not, just let me know).
You showed up in this conversation with an incorrect belief about what "Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin" represented. You were almost immediately **confronted with new information that contradicted your existing beliefs and ideas** (the numerous Satoshi quotes and citations that I provided, which wholly disproved your original beliefs on the matter). This appeared to give you great **discomfort**, as evidenced by your increasingly-hysterical comment replies afterwards.
Hopefully now you understand what it was that I was communicating, and how "cognitive dissonance" is the exact phenomenon to which I was referring. 
Don't be embarrassed, though. At this point, you're on tilt and not thinking clearly. It could happen to anyone.


So you're saying that you fully support SegWit? Great, me too!


I'm very open-minded. I just seem to have interpreted multiple orders of magnitude more information than you on this subject. Just because you're not currently aware of the pitfalls of some particular approach or model, doesn't mean that I am not. You do not seem to be in a position where you can seriously evaluate how "open-minded" I am when it comes to informational synthesis on the subject of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. No offense, of course. We all had to start somewhere.


You seem confused. There's a lot of questions in this word soup, but the bottom line is that *I* think Satoshi was right, on almost everything he said. I understand that the majority of mining is done in data centers these days, and I understand that Satoshi predicted this as the normal expected trajectory of Bitcoin mining. I also understand that Bitcoin is serving its utility as electronic cash admirably right now. I also understand (at least some of the reasons) why Satoshi put the block limit there in the first place (which you still clearly do not). I understand the utility of SPV clients. None of this contradicts anything that I've written here. It doesn't seem like you're quite fathoming anything that I'm saying, but trust me, none of this is a rebuttal; it is all in perfect accordance with everything that I've told you.


Yes, of course. Once again you seem to be voicing support for the Core Scaling Roadmap and SegWit. Which is great, we've found common ground.

Yes, including himself. He argued (on many separate occasions) that it was best to limit the size of the blockchain as much as possible. When he said "Bitcoin users might become increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain", he was actually advocating doing exactly that, *and taking their side!* Go read the quote and its context again, it looks like you missed the point the first time around.


There is really only one proposal to scale Bitcoin on-chain right now: SegWit. No one else seems to have any suggestions other than "use an altcoin", which (of course) you're free to do if you want.

It's a choice. Adding replay protection would be pretty easy, and people have offered to write the code for them. Unfortunately, they operate via closed-door development (basically what Jeff Garzik says, goes).
The reason they're not implementing replay protection is to attempt to trick lite clients into thinking that they are the original Bitcoin, rather than an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:09:30
My "analergy" actually applies far better than you seem to realize.
"Copying the whole code and history of the USD" is, in the analogy, done via a hand-drawn replication. If it helps you to understand better, let's pretend that I scan a dollar with an ordinary scanner, and print it out with my printer. There, I just "copied the whole code and history" of that dollar. The serial code on my counterfeit dollar matches the one on the real dollar, so they both share the same transaction history. 
We can extend the hypothetical, to demonstrate things even more clearly. Pretend that after I scanned that first dollar, I opened up Photoshop and modified the serial number on it digitally. Then I set up a script to do this automatically, printing out the new counterfeit dollars as they are generated by the script. Finally, I set up a business where I say "Anyone can come show me a real US dollar, and I'll give you the 'USD2' with the same serial number." Or I could set up a vending machine that does so for me.
This still wouldn't cause problems (other than lack of government tolerance, like we saw with pre-Bitcoin privately-issued monies like Liberty Reserve). Again, my USD2 would not be USD, and even if I printed a gazillion new USD2 notes, it doesn't mean that the USD will experience inflation.
This is *exactly* analogous to what has happened with BCash.

Bitcoin is perfectly capable of hard-forking and remaining Bitcoin.
A non-contentious hard-fork would be an evolution of Bitcoin (a protocol upgrade).
A *contentious* hard fork is just the birth of an altcoin. Satoshi even explicitly discouraged a contentious hard fork, taking Theymos' side over Jeff Garzik's, in the very same thread you're quoting:








In particular, that last sentence qualifies that Satoshi only considered such a patch to be viable **if** the network "needs" it... which all Bitcoin experts pretty much universally agree it does not, at this time.
According to Satoshi, trying to apply such patches before the rest of the ecosystem agrees to doing so represents departure from Bitcoin.

If you don't like Satoshi's vision, there are other coins that prioritize fee minimization. Satoshi expected Bitcoin to transition to fee-based-incentives within the first 10-20 years of its existence, while the first 99% of coins are mined. We're coming up on the ten-year mark.

It is indeed very, **very** bullish for Bitcoin, but not because of "reduced volatility" (which is unlikely in the first place).
It's bullish because...
* There is less profit to be made from downward price movements and margin cascades (due to new regulatory friction regarding margin trading and shorting)
* There is less incentive for (or reliance on) unsavory bucket-shop practices (e.g. algorithmic trade frontrunning on Chinese exchanges), as the exchanges now have a clearly-defined and straightforward business models and are understood to be under the scrutiny of the People's Bank of China
* The exchange volume figures from Chinese exchanges will generally cease to be zero-cost gameable, so they will be more directly useful for analyses and comparisons to Western exchanges
* The People's Bank of China has essentially just given general Bitcoin trading an explicit blessing, selectively limiting only certain types of activities on the exchanges and providing clarity with regards to regulatory compliance
It might also help the "move to smaller units" initiative, which would be a bullish development, as well.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:54:47
There is no "pride element" here. Core developers have **no power** to force a contentious hard fork. Trying to do so would almost *guarantee* massive monetary losses, in fact.
It would be absolutely *insane*ly irresponsible to try to rush out an unnecessary hard fork and gain community consensus for it because someone else is threatening to hard fork in the next couple of months. Let them hard fork, spread awareness of the relevant dangers and risks, and if the attackers absolutely refuse to implement replay protections on their new altcoin, prosecute accordingly. Those are really the only options available here, from Bitcoiners' perspectives.
Quit trying to make this out as some weird "Core cabal" or a "pride issue" because it is nothing of the sort, and you're embarrassing yourself by penning that nonsense. You are quite literally suggesting that Core launch an altcoin, trying to kill Bitcoin in the process, to retaliate against others launching an altcoin. It is absurd.

I just re-read your original comment and saw that you were talking about "confirmation times" from the beginning, so I was mistaken in saying that you conflated it with block intervals.
But the larger point still remains: confirmation times, as measured in charts like that one, do not reflect the actual practical confirmation times of transactions on the network when technology like payment channels is factored in.
Another way to look at it is this: pretend I go launch a new blockchain called "BullshitCoin", with 10-millisecond blocks. No one uses this blockchain except for me. Since I am not competing with other users for transaction inclusion, I can make transactions to myself that confirm basically-instantly, but this doesn't indicate that BullshitCoin is superior to Bitcoin in any way. In fact, it should be obvious that BullshitCoin is *worse* than Bitcoin in every way that matters, even though this particular metric (as measured by Blockchain.info-esque sites) might seem to indicate otherwise.
And finally, "confirmation" is only useful as an indication of "unlikelihood of transaction reversal", and in Bitcoin, 1 confirmation is equivalent to *many* confirmations of a lower-hashrate or smaller-block-interval blockchain.

Even with pruning enabled, full-node software (like Bitcoin Core) is going to take a few days to fully sync, because it still downloads and verifies every single Bitcoin transaction ever made (and this takes time, bandwidth, and computation). The data is thrown away (pruned) after validation, but it is still downloaded and validated. This is pretty "heavyweight" compared to lite/SPV clients like Electrum, which don't bother to do such validation, and can be used "out-of-the-box" or on a mobile phone, without having to download the blockchain history.
What wallet you use really comes down to what your priorities are. If you want to self-validate, a full node is the way to go (probably with pruning enabled). If that's not as important to you, or if you're in a rush, something like Electrum is probably a better bet.
@_date: 2016-11-13 00:54:04
It seems like you might not understand the vulnerability here. Imagine there is no limit, and a big mining operation decides to include a preposterously large transaction (which takes multiple minutes to verify because of how many signatures are included, and the fact that certain sigops are validated in quadratic time). Every other miner is now presented with the following choice:
Option 1: Accept the block and validate the transaction normally.
Option 2: Reject/ignore the block and continue mining on its predecessor (i.e. attempt to orphan the block).
Option 3: Accept the block without validating the transaction in it.
Option 1 means you are basically wasting time rather than mining. It incurs a severe competitive disadvantage, and in extreme cases (e.g. if the transaction takes more than 10 minutes to validate) you are essentially no longer mining. Option 2 also incurs a severe competitive disadvantage, because you are now mining from one block behind any miners who accepted the block. And Option 3 basically breaks the Bitcoin security model, and potentially opens a giant vulnerability wherein one of these transactions is deliberately included (maliciously) which does not actually ultimately validate. This could easily fork the network (those who validate will reject it, those who do not validate will accept it) and/or defraud subsets of the network. It would be a bit of a nightmare scenario.
The argument that "Oh, other miners would just ignore those huge blocks, it'd be obvious when such an infraction was malicious" is naive and misses the point; the issue would be exploited gradually and there would likely be no obvious "sore thumb" transaction that is obviously identifiable. Big, expensive-to-validate transactions would show up more and more (and grow marginally) over time, with an identical end result but without an obvious point of blame.
Without fail, those who advocate "no limit at all" do not understand this vulnerability nor the nuances thereof. It's unfortunate that the reality of the situation is that "small blockers" *do* understand the arguments of the "large blockers" but the reverse is not true in the slightest.
@_date: 2017-01-21 21:57:33
Great question. [Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported.](
It's important to note that this only applies to SegWit-style transactions (people would still be able to make the old-style transactions which don't have this benefit, even if SegWit were activated), so it doesn't completely remove the vulnerability, but it does give us a way to increase the blocksize (for SegWit users) without creating a new vulnerability in this regard. 
There is also a proposal called "FlexibleTransactions" which, if I'm not mistaken, would achieve similar benefits. However, from my understanding there are a number of drawbacks and issues with the FlexTrans proposal (off the top of my head, I recall that there were ways to trivially generate hash collisions under FlexTrans which break the whole thing), and it hasn't been finished (much less tested), and there is only one developer working on it (who, no offense intended, is a pretty poor developer). 
In other words, this issue is solvable in a number of ways, but the only finished or good solution right now (and the only solution that has received serious peer-review and test coverage) is SegWit.
For that particular vulnerability, in fact, you could actually just hard fork the blocksize up and introduce a new limit (limiting transaction sigops), which is what Bitcoin Classic originally did. The problem is that this introduces a whole new arbitrary limit, isn't a very useful change to make, and might have unintended consequences down the line. In fact, Bitcoin Classic ended up *removing* that new limit because of problems they encountered regarding it.
As a final note, I apologize for any rudeness I've displayed in our conversation. It is very uncool to be rude to someone who is interested in having a genuine discussion (which you seem to be), so again, sorry. That's on me.

It doesn't really matter what I say, but blocks containing SegWit transactions can be larger than 1MB, which was the old limit before SegWit was activated. That's unambiguously a blocksize limit increase. There is no opinion involved here, this is all verifiable firsthand.

Yes, it was. I even linked you to the file where it used to be. You'll notice that in versions of Bitcoin Core greater than 0.13.0 that the MAX_BLOCKSIZE constant no longer exists.
It was replaced by the blockweight limit. And I notice that you are pointedly refusing to acknowledge the whole "SegWit transactions are actually (slightly) larger" point, which is in direct and irrefutable contradiction to the lies you were spouting off upthread.

The block contains the entire transaction, actually.
It sounds like you have some mistaken beliefs about how SegWit works. It actually sounds like all the reasons you dislike SegWit are actually just misconceptions.


Satoshi's comment is about transaction format upgrades being possible as soft forks, and how he designed Bitcoin from the very beginning with this sort of upgrade path in mind. It doesn't have anything to do with adding non-transaction-data (like you suggest with OP_RETURN), and in fact Satoshi was very much against such data being stored on the blockchain at all.
I don't mean to be rude by saying this, but you might want to ease off on reading the more *conspiratorial* subreddits... you seem to have some pretty severe misunderstandings on how things work, on a technical level, which all seem to be results of the misinformation campaigns that they have been responsible for.
I am legitimately happy to walk you through how transaction serialization works, on both SegWit transactions and legacy transactions, with direct source code citations for everything I tell you, if you disbelieve anything I've said here. I can give you locally-replicable experiments so that you can confirm the claims firsthand. The whole "Don't trust, verify" thing is more than a pithy saying, it's a legitimate recommendation on how to approach technical questions in Bitcoin. And until you verify things yourself, you can fall victim to misinformation (regardless of its origin) and have no idea how to tell truth from fiction.

I *do* want to point out, though, that the claim that "the blocksize limit is just an obsolete spam prevention mechanism" is not really supported by anything Satoshi said, and in fact, he pretty much (if not explicitly, close to it) denied that it had anything to do with spam a couple months after it was introduced.

@_date: 2017-01-26 04:25:02
If I understand you correctly, then yes, that's right.
Basically, if your node asks "Hey, please give me block  then my node will respond "Alright, are you upgraded to support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you). 
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it.

As Satoshi himself observed, there is effectively infinite demand for a distributed immutable database hosted on others' dime. If there were no pending transactions to compete with, one lone entity could (and should be expected to) use up all excess network capacity at an effective marginal cost of zero per transaction/entry. 
People are still able to transact, of course, so your second question is a total non sequitur. They simply must transact at market-competitive fee-rates if a fast confirmation of their transaction(s) is a priority. If you're not a fan of free markets, Bitcoin probably isn't going to be up your alley.

This is incredibly inaccurate. You've been corrected on this multiple times. Stop spreading misinformation.
SegWit increases the blocksize, period. It is not an accounting trick at all, and it isn't an "effective" increase, it is a bona fide blocksize increase with restrictions regarding the data that can go into the expanded portion of the block.
You are intentionally spreading misinformation at this point. Stop.

The size of a transaction has no bearing  on whether the consumer wants chargeback abilities; any rational consumer would *always* prefer the ability to chargeback, obviously.
It is the seller who is adversely impacted by the capability of chargebacks. 
This has been known and discussed ad nauseum here for half a decade now. But really, it's good to see so many newbies around here these days, trying to think through this stuff for the first time.

The problem with using "does it fit well with the fact that Mt. Gox was covering up their insolvency" as your sole criteria by which to judge the validity of a particular conspiracy theory is that pretty much any explanation meets that criteria. We know for a fact that the perpetrators of the Willy hypothesis went out of their way to present and frame (known-to-be doctored) data to support a particular narrative. That's a bare-bones fact, and no amount of debate will change it. And if you were doing such a thing, it's obvious that you would spend a little bit of time picking a narrative that "fits very well" with the Gox situation and what the public knew about it. So, really, the "does it kinda fit?" yardstick isn't particularly helpful in assessing the legitimacy of the conspiracy theory, at least not beyond an initial gut-check.
If the leaked trade data wasn't so conspicuously doctored, if instead it had been a complete dataset without giant awkward illogical gaps sprinkled sporadically throughout, that would be one thing. But the data was instead anonymously leaked (and came bundled with malware, no less) and, despite containing verifiably-legitimate trades, had giant swaths of missing history. None of this history has since surfaced. 
Personally, I think the truth behind the Willy report went something like this...
Disgruntled (or bored) Gox employee has a backup of historical trade data squirreled away. One of their friends buys it off of them, and brainstorms the best way to make some money with it. There's no obvious best way to do it, but remember the context: this was 2014, just after 2 back-to-back bubbles the year prior and in the wake of the Gox implosion... Bitcoin was in a bear market. Eventually the friend decides the best way to make a buck here is to try and short the market and release a giant "reveal" that "omg Bitcoin was actually totally manipulated by fake conspiracy bots, sell sell sell" to trigger some selling pressure. Oh, and toss in some wallet-stealing malware, why not?
But the dataset doesn't involve some boogeybot, of course. So you insert some new data, and basically photoshop one in. But now things don't match up, and if you release your bombshell analysis focusing on "Willy" then these fake trades are in the spotlight, and it won't take long for people to realize "None of us were on the other side of those particular trades" and immediately dismiss the conspiracy as a result. That won't do. So how can you fix this?
Easy. Just chop out big chunks of data at random. Now the dataset is incomplete, so no one can dismiss the Willy trades outright for lack of ability to match them to anyone else (after all, everyone who ever traded on Gox now has their trade history fully accounted for if you release it *all*), but people can still see that at least *some* of the history is valid, by matching up the trades that didn't get removed with their own personal records.
You release the data, wait a bit to draft up your "innocent analysis by unrelated but also conveniently anonymous random internet sleuth", and the rest is history.
I've tried to think of alternative plausible explanations for the missing chunks of data, and can't really come up with anything. It wasn't missing in predictable patterns, like the full data had been distributed between servers or anything. It was just big random chunks, missing for no good reason. 
At the very least, when we confront the reality of the missing data, Occam's Razor tells us that the data was removed deliberately. The only good reason I can think of for such a removal would be to obscure the truth. And the only narrative that has been pushed regarding this dataset has been the "Willy" theory. 
Honestly, typing it all out like this makes me rule out the whole Willy thing even more firmly. It seems to me that any narrative that was borne of "deep analysis" into that dataset by some anonymous blogger is *particularly* suspect when we look at the full story here.

Great question. In such a scenario, there's no clear answer on "which chain is Bitcoin" (or even whether Bitcoin could be considered dead at that point).
It's reminiscent of the [Ship of Theseus]( paradox, in that it is a question of *identity* (and the continuity thereof) and there is no clear "right answer".
In cases where one section of the community breaks from the existing consensus rules and the other retains them, it is clear which is Bitcoin. In cases where *both* sides break from the existing consensus rules, it's not clear at all.

They want to destroy it so that they can replace it with something they have more control over, of course. If they're able to kill Bitcoin but capture the value into CorpCoin, they think they can hijack the crypto revolution and enstate themselves as the Kings of Tomorrow.
Mike Hearn started this whole thing, literally explicitly explaining that he wanted to take over as "Bitcoin's Benevolent Dictator" and have Gavin be his second-in-command. We later discovered that he was employed by R3 at the time, who were tasked by the biggest banks in the world to develop a "Bitcoin killer". Gavin was apparently bamboozled into playing along, and lost himself along the way. Eventually Mike and R3 gave up and capitulated, sending off one last parting ragequit cheapshot before fading into the background and having their funding cut shortly afterwards.
Apparently Mike inspired a few others to follow in his failed footsteps; there have been a string of hostile attempts to co-opt Bitcoin since then. 2X is not magically different from the rest.

The 95% threshold is not magic, it is just the threshold that was set for activation. It's a good solid indication of "supermajority support" to have 95% of miners compatible.
What happens is that each miner/pool who has upgraded to support SegWit attaches "flags" to their blocks that they mine, to signal that they are ready for SegWit activation. After a 2-week period passes where 95% or more of the blocks have these signal flags on them, SegWit will wait 2 more weeks and finally "activate", at which point the miners who are supporting it will begin supporting SegWit transactions and mining (or at least not rejecting) larger blocks that abide by SegWit's rules.

Actually, not quite correct. A miner can remain on pre-SegWit code (e.g. Core 0.13.0) and will remain perfectly compatible with all valid SegWit blocks. That's what it means to be a soft fork.
All SegWit blocks will still be valid according to old rules. That is the beauty of it.

This community abides by certain rules. It's not a "total free for all where anything goes" and you honestly don't have the right to demand that it become so.
If someone (or an army of someones) showed up here and made a hundred posts about ElephantCoin, constantly yammering about how "Bitcoin is doomed so you better buy ElephantCoin" all day long, a laissez faire policy would be tantamount to sacrificing this place to the wolves. You can post about ElephantCoin all you want in and a dozen other altcoin-friendly subreddits and communities out there. The same goes for other coins that aren't Bitcoin.
mercilessly curates their discussions, and as a result the subreddit is a consistent source of high-quality (and well-cited) scientific information. This isn't "censorship" in any meaningful sense, it's a rule/policy that is there to prevent the subreddit from being eaten alive by the entropic force colloquially referred to as Eternal September. 
There are other communities out there where you can openly discuss various ways to attack Bitcoin and its community, and you'll get upvoted (by paid upvoters, in some cases) for your antagonism. This isn't one of those communities. This subreddit fills a different niche.
Maybe this subreddit isn't for you. That's perfectly okay. No one is forcing you to come here. But when you *do* come here, understand that there are community rules, and you're not exempt from them, no matter how many times you repeat the word "censorship" and now matter how big of a ruckus you try to raise. 
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but that's how things stand. I hope that you can see where I am coming from (I would say "we" but I really have no authority to speak on behalf of anyone else who moderates this place). I want this place to be an open discussion board where lively debate takes place, but I do not share the opinion that "letting anyone and everyone say what they want, no matter what, *even if all signal is drowned out entirely by noise as a result*" is the best way to achieve that goal.

BitcoinXT was **an absolute joke**. It exponentially grew the blocksize **well past** any sane or safe limits, and I absolutely got to see their work properly critiqued, because -- and pay close attention here, because you seem blissfully unaware of this *critical* fact -- **serious developmental discussion does not happen on reddit**. Reddit is a *terrible* platform for serious technical discussion, which is why no one uses it for such. 
Now, I can tell that you're not a developer in two ways: you think BitcoinXT was a "serious" and "polished" hard fork proposal, and you think that reddit is the platform where meaningful software development critiquing and peer review takes place. So, my question to you is: *why, as a non-expert who clearly does not have the domain knowledge to be able to reasonably assess codebase changes, do you think your opinion on the subject has any relevance whatsoever*? If you didn't know a damn thing about cars, and a mechanic (or a group of the best mechanics in the world) told you what was wrong with your engine, would you just ignore what they said? 
Not only did BitcoinXT fail the peer-review process on technical grounds, it was later revealed to be a political coup in disguise. Mike Hearn openly admitted that he would be the sole arbiter of what is allowed or merged into XT, basically saying "I would be king of the Bitcoin codebase", and Mike Hearn was *secretly employed at R3 at the time*! Not only that, but Mike was never a real Core developer; he didn't work on the Core codebase, he did other stuff like bitcoinj and Lighthouse. One of the very few changes he made to the Core codebase resulted in a nightmarish chain-split (and successful doublespends) -- since you're probably unaware of this, feel free to look into the BerkeleyDB incident on your own time. Mike Hearn was also a long-time advocate for protocol-level blacklisting, as well as actively working to suppress Tor compatibility, and as a result was one of *the most controversial* developers in the space (to put it mildly); he was, in short, a cancer that Bitcoin is best off without. And he was trying to *take control*.
Before ending my rant, I have to hammer one point home, regardless of how repetitive it might be: **reddit is not where serious peer-review takes place**. You clearly did not know this when you wrote your comment here, which means that you clearly no next-to-nothing about Bitcoin development (or open source development in general), which means you really need to keep your opinions to yourself on this stuff. It's like a child who doesn't even know basic arithmetic yet, barging into a classroom where Calculus is taught, loudly trying to argue about mathematical functions and properties. It is embarrassing, and you (like the child in the Calculus classroom) are not even equipped to understand *how* embarrassing it is. You're in a very pitiable position of almost-total ignorance.

The entire community did, that's how Bitcoin works. It remains the status quo (which means consensus rules, e.g. "21 million maximum coins" are very very very hard to change) in the absence of an overwhelming supermajority of agreement to change. It's as close as possible to an *unmodifiable* consensus construct, by design. If you are on board with Bitcoin, that's what you signed up for.
That means that you have necessarily agreed to: "If a hard fork proposal doesn't have overwhelming consensus, then it isn't Bitcoin"... there are other tools and protocols that are more malleable, if you're interested in those instead. Bitcoin is unique, and maybe it's not for you (or maybe you don't realize just *how* it will be "for you", in the long run, just yet).

Market cap ratio. Go to CoinMarketCap.com and you'll see what people are referring to when they reference this metric.
If all the listed tokens were "fair launch" coins, and didn't have pre-mines or other such gimmicks, then the metric might be worth some real consideration. But when you're comparing something like Bitcoin with something like my silly demo coin (which most new tokens/coins actually do resemble, in some respects), it loses any semblance of meaning.

The main problem with Ethereum is not actually the blockchain bloat (though that is part of it), the bigger issue is that it doesn't actually provide an economical solution to any problems. Everything you can achieve with Ethereum, you can achieve more efficiently and cheaper (and with other advantages, too) with another tool or solution.
They've done a very good job hyping their platform, though. Their PR is remarkable. So people who don't really understand the real benefits of a blockchain, but want to be early adopters of "the next Bitcoin"/"Bitcoin 2.0" have gotten really excited and bought in to the idea... and since the whole system is really technical (confusing/dazzling), it will likely take quite a while before those people realize that the model doesn't really make sense and that Ethereum isn't going to rise in value like Bitcoin has/will. 
The good news, though, is that all their hard work and development effort isn't going to be wasted, because all their code is open source. So for problems that *could* potentially be solved economically with an Ethereum-esque platform (which will most likely end up being a sidechain like Rootstock), there's an existing foundation to build from, and no wheels will need to be reinvented. 
So, basically, Ethereum itself isn't going to play a huge role over the long-term, but the work that they are doing is hopefully going to have a positive impact later on down the line. Which is great.

Most people who hear about Bitcoin treat it (and the proponents of the tech) with aggressive hostility. It makes sense, because Bitcoin very much sounds "too good to be true" and inherently challenges fundamental assumptions about money that most of us take for granted.

One unfortunate consequence of this is that Bitcoiners can get a little grumpy over time, from dealing with incessant naysayers and haters. On behalf of the community here: sorry about the hostility. We try our best. :)

@_date: 2016-11-25 23:42:21
Bitcoin has never hard-forked. Nice lies, though.
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:05:10


No, that was his point. Most of the crowd he is referring to will *blatantly lie* about it being a blocksize increase at all. They will repeatedly deny that it is a blocksize increase, with weird rhetoric like "it's a question of semantics" and lots of ad hominem attacks and conspiracy theories about "BlockstreamCore", no matter how patiently or politely you try to educate them and correct their misconceptions.
BashCo wouldn't have made the above comment if these posters were making reasonable contributions to the discussion (like what you describe). It is not like what you describe, though. 


Yes. Google *Bitcoin capacity roadmap* and it should be the first result. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 23:55:19
That *would* massively decrease the costs of running a full node. Do you have any analysis indicating that the benefits of doing so would outweigh the costs of restraining capacity to that degree? If so, we'd love to hear it.
@_date: 2016-12-04 05:09:14
I don't like the censorship either, but Bitcoin is valuable **because** it is resistant to social attacks like the one orchestrated by R3 and Mike Hearn. If Bitcoin changed on community whims, it would be worthless. Full stop.

What about in cases where 80% of comments in certain threads are this sort of thing?
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:41:34


In a way, some are mitigated. But the fact that you asked this question is indication that you are *surprisingly* ignorant on this matter.
If we have a truck, and it can only carry 2 tons of weight, and we load it up with  the full 2 tons, and then someone shows up and says "Let's throw some more weight on there!", we would break the truck by following their advice. This does not mean that taking off some of the weight on the truck (say, 1 ton) magically makes it "less broken", because the truck was able to handle *up to 2 tons of weight*. It is not the difference between 1 ton and 2 tons that would break the truck and cause it to collapse, but the difference between 2 tons and 3 tons.


For one, transaction sigops limits. These scale quadratically, and with a "straightforward" hard-fork blocksize increase, it means that a miner can include "poisonously" high-sigop-count transactions in the blocks they mine; transactions that take **more than 10 minutes to verify**. Do you realize what effect that would have on the network and other miners? 
It's amazing to me that you're trying to *argue* rather than *learn* here. Recognize the fact that you know very little about this subject, and behave accordingly. You're just embarrassing yourself by arguing about stuff you obviously do not understand.

I'm not talking about SegWit...
I know that SegWit results in larger blocks. That's the only controversial aspect of it, and the reason it hasn't already activated. But it isn't the subject of our discussion here.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:44:02
See, you basically just said "I know absolutely nothing about what I'm talking about." Not a single mention of sigops in your entire comment. An open admission that you haven't been following LN developments. 
Why do people like you feel the need to voice your inconsequential opinions on a subject that you obviously have no real knowledge of? It is truly baffling.

This is like saying "I'd like some water in my water, please. No water unless I get some water." Can you imagine what it sounds like, from a technical perspective? The person clearly doesn't understand the words they are saying, so it's hard to communicate past that point in the conversation.


SegWit as a hard fork would merely move the witness commitment from the coinbase transaction to the block header. It is an absolutely trivial and superficial difference. The only real reason it's not done that way is because soft forks are objectively better; everyone doesn't have to upgrade at once and there's no risk of winding up on the wrong chain.
Neither of those "Group B" statements make sense. Are you able to appreciate what I'm telling you here?
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:09:37
That is only *one* problem that Ethereum suffers from. Yes, it is a problem shared by Rootstock. However, in the case of RSK, you would generally not be hodling the asset with the large attack surface ("smart bitcoins") and instead it would make sense keep normal, ultra-secure and insulated-from-the-sidechain bitcoins for long-term storage and transfer over as needed when using a smart contract. 
Combine this risk-mitigating mechanism with the whole "cheaper to execute on RSK than ETH" factor, and you've got a demonstrably superior solution. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:07:01
If you upgrade your own node to support SegWit, you will see larger blocks. Otherwise, whenever you request a block (via your un-upgraded node), the network will supply you the "stripped down" block which is &lt;1MB in size.
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:43:57
Walmart and Starbucks would almost certainly open a channel between each other. Boom, every single customer of either establishment now enjoys trivial routing to either Walmart, Starbucks, or the other customers who frequent those establishments.
And to remind you what the *actual* claim here was, it was Ratcliff saying LN can only possibly work with microtransactions. I have demonstrated just how profoundly stupid and wrong this claim is. Full stop.
I love how you're trying to be condescending, though, while showing off your ignorance. Quite funny.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:56:48
Consensus is a [computer science concept]( To summarize, it is basically the problem of "coordinating" distributed systems, processes, or agents.
In the context of Bitcoin, if you're running full-node software, it determines what consensus ruleset you are "watching" or interacting with. 
Other blockchains have different consensus rulesets (these are known as "altcoins"). A few examples are Litecoin, Bcash, and Monero. These networks have internal consensus, but are *not* in consensus with the Bitcoin blockchain.
Now, when it comes to modifying blockchain consensus rules, there are two general possibilities: hard forks and soft forks. Hard forks *replace* old consensus rules with new ones, whereas soft forks *work within* the old consensus rules. My favorite analogy is one of shapes: if we had a consensus rule that "people can only draw rectangles on our network" and then one day we wanted to update this rule, then saying "people can draw circles now, too" would be a hard fork, whereas saying "people can only draw *squares* on our network" would be a soft fork, because every square *is* a rectangle already, by definition. The existing consensus rule *was not broken*.
@_date: 2016-11-17 00:26:45
In this particular respect, simply a realist. A solid technical understanding of certain coins (in this case Monero) will lead to these conclusions.
There is no reason why Bitcoin *has* to be the "last coin standing", but as of right now it's the only serious game in town.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:17:14
Correction: **Bitcoin** rises on Trump victory. Almost every other crypto was down yesterday and today.
The article mentions Zcash as an example of an exception, but Zcash is down 99.99% in the past month or so. It happened to experience a minor oscillation to the upside in the middle of a massive multi-week-long mega-bear trend today, which in no way is a result of the election.
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:50:39


No one *ever* made that claim. Not once.
You cannot provide a *single* example of someone claiming (in 2014 or earlier) that Bitcoin will result in "cheap/free **on-chain** transactions". The "on-chain" qualifier was not being used years ago.
Watch, everyone, as completely fails to furnish such a quote. They will either not respond at all, or try to weasel out of this with bullshit rhetoric, but they will **not** be able to provide any quotes to back up their false claim.
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:41:02
Promoting a client is advocating for that client's usage. Anti-consensus is a technical term, in the context of Bitcoin, it would be a change that induces a fork in the chain between nodes that adhere to the change and nodes that do not.
Anyone with a technical understanding of Bitcoin knows what network consensus means, and can objectively identify changes that violate it. It's only ignorant people and sockpuppets who pretend like there is controversy about this.
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:43:49
No, because that doesn't test any of the interesting changes that Bitcoin Unlimited has made (specifically the dynamic blocksize limit). That needs to be tested, which is what testnets are for. The fact that BU isn't running a testnet right now speaks volumes.
@_date: 2016-11-19 22:13:48
Right. Which is why a barely-used blockchain (where no one else is competing for blockspace) will have a quicker average confirmation time than a widely-used blockchain, even if they both have the same 10-minute block times.
@_date: 2016-11-16 02:16:36
But the whole point is that this isn't an attack, just a way to donate to the miners if you have money to spare.
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:35:42
The problem is that you're conflating "confirmation time" with "block interval". Though these two variables are related, they are not equivalent.
If I go make a transaction that pays a much smaller fee than the average, it might take 60 blocks before a miner bothers to include it. That transaction would have had a 10-hour confirmation time (thereby increasing the average transaction confirmation time) but it would not mean that blocks take longer than 10 minutes, on average, to be mined.
On the other end of the spectrum, if you and I opened a payment channel to one another, we could make a million virtually-instant transactions in one minute between us, and then close the payment channel and settle to the blockchain with one final transaction. Even though this would mean that a million (totally valid) transactions were made in one minute, it wouldn't affect the block interval, and in fact, it would never be reflected in a graph like that one from Blockchain.info. 
The power of payment channels is a big reason why "confirmation time" is a bad metric to worry about.

No, he didn't. In fact, according to Satoshi, the blocksize limit has *nothing* to do with spam prevention. When the minrelayfee was first implemented, he described it as "the first attempt" to addressing network spam. This was well after the 1MB blocksize limit was implemented.

As Satoshi himself observed, there is effectively infinite demand for a distributed immutable database hosted on others' dime. If there were no pending transactions to compete with, one lone entity could (and should be expected to) use up all excess network capacity at an effective marginal cost of zero per transaction/entry. 
People are still able to transact, of course. They simply must transact at market-competitive fee-rates if a fast confirmation of their transaction(s) is a priority. If you're not a fan of free markets, Bitcoin probably isn't going to be up your alley.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:38:53
A consensus rule is a consensus rule. You violate *any* consensus rules, and your block is invalid, and won't be accepted by a Bitcoin full node. *It doesn't matter* whether it's granting yourself 100 BTC out of thin air, or if it's a 5 MB block, or if you try to move someone's coins without satisfying the associated Script encumbrance. Any consensus violation results in invalidity, period.
That's how Bitcoin works, on a technical level. I know it can be confusing at first, but keep asking questions and thinking critically and it will all start to make sense as you learn more.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:01:36

@_date: 2016-11-14 01:22:42
Look at my original comment:






From the very beginning, this has been my point. Your silly "on-chain" nonsense didn't exist years ago. What *did* exist years ago was cogent discussion -- even from Satoshi himself -- about trustless payment channel technology and other such cryptographic schemes to facilitate efficient Bitcoin transacting. It was only recently that the rbtc crowd started pretending like "on-chain" is some sort of magical qualifier that confers worth unto transactions. No one ever talked about "free on-chain transactions", just like I said. And you, as predicted, have failed to find a single quote to the contrary.
When we talk about scaling Bitcoin, we are striving for *greater capacity*. A trustless cryptographic transfer scheme using bitcoins without necessitating a blockchain settlement at every step achieves greater capacity. If you can use your bitcoins to pay Starbucks every day for your daily coffee, and pay next-to-nothing by way of fees, without any marginal risk of double-spend or other fraudulent exploitation, why should you care about the individual transactions' "on-chaininess"? 
"On-chain" does not mean "good" and "off-chain" does not mean "bad". What is relevant is the security model of any system you are participating in (or considering), the tradeoffs and specific considerations entailed. No one in any of the irrelevant quotes you (for some reason) dug up mentioned the phrase "on-chain" because that was not considered some special distinction. In fact, it still isn't, except inside the rbtc echo-chamber as they collectively shift their ridiculous goalposts.
@_date: 2016-11-25 05:20:23


Agreed! A hard fork should be done with a year or more of advance notice, just like Satoshi suggested when he first mentioned raising the blocksize cap.
That's one of the reasons it seems so strange to me to want to block SegWit in favor of some other (hard-fork) blocksize increase. It would be 2018 by the time such a hard fork could safely activate. That seems like a long time to wait for a capacity increase, especially when we have one tested and ready to go right now!
Recent estimates also put SegWit at an effective 2.1MB of blocksize capacity if fully adopted, which means it would be a larger direct capacity increase than a hard-fork to 2MB like what Bitcoin Classic attempted. Knowing this, it's especially surprising that *anyone* who has been advocating blocksize increases would ever oppose SegWit, don't you think?
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:31:53


No, the figure is now 2.1MB. That 1.7MB estimate is over a year old, and no longer relevant. P2SH is significantly more used these days, which yields the now-accurate 2.1MB estimate.


How ironic!
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:29:43
I gave you too little credit, I expected an angry response and I got a gracious one instead.
I apologize if I was a dick throughout our conversation. I have a bad habit of being so. These days I'm too on-edge and am not nearly as patient or polite as I should be because of all the infighting in the community.
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:12:51
That's a separate BIP, but yes, he has proposed that (accompanied with hard fork code to increase the blocksize to 31MB over time). Which, you may note, fulfills his last obligation from the "Hong Kong agreement" as the numpties often call it.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:15:29
No, not at all. Not even close. The OP seems to be using a year-long timeframe, despite there being many other available "start dates" that would have made the gains figure even more impressive.
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:44:34


For final transaction settlement beyond all means of reversibility, yes, some transactions took multiple hours to finalize. Contrast this with any other monetary settlement method, where the same finalization takes *months* in the best-case scenarios, and you might start to get an idea of how funny of a "complaint" this is.


No, they didn't. This is a shameless lie.
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:43:41
If you're referring to the March 2013 overflow incident, no hard fork actually ever occurred. 
If you're referring to something else, let me know.

Nope, just the transactions for opening and closing channels.

And as *I* said, you have no idea what you're talking about and are just showing off how ignorant you are.

@_date: 2016-11-16 03:18:24


No, we have analysis which indicates that he might have somewhere around this amount, but the analysis is **far** from conclusive.


No, not true. Hal Finney had mined *at least* one block by January 12, 2009 (when he received the very first Bitcoin transaction). This was less than 10 days after Bitcoin was released.


It is the exact opposite of a premine, in fact. The reason why the Genesis Block includes the infamous "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" quote is that it proves that the coin was *not* premined and instead can boast a fair and open launch.

No, the pro-Core group generally stays in because it's pretty much the only place on reddit where any rational discourse about Bitcoin takes place. 
The "anti-Core group", as you call them (who might be more accurately called the "anti-Bitcoin group"), don't have any means of "correcting" any viewpoints, because they don't seem to understand the subjects they want to argue about, even on a basic level. For instance, you still see people in claiming on a daily basis that "SegWit isn't a blocksize increase" and that SegWit "allows a maximum of 1.7MB blocks but costs the network 4MB of load for doing so", or that "SegWit is a hard fork disguised as a soft fork" despite the fact that none of these statements makes any sense whatsoever to someone who understands the subject. No matter how much proof is provided contrary to these claims and no matter how thoroughly they are debunked (you can *link* them to blocks 3.6MB in size containing 7.5k tx, you can explain the exact definition and distinction between a soft fork and a hard fork, etc), they will be echoed repeatedly by the subreddit in unison day by day.
You can't "correct" the viewpoint of someone who understands the subject unless you understand it, too. And does not. So it's not a matter of "those in will never get their viewpoints challenged or corrected because of censorship"; that's simply not true. Many of us frequent simply to correct the false statements parroted over there every day, and all of our explanations get downvoted and ignored because the subreddit is fundamentally anti-Bitcoin and aren't interested in learning the truth.


You can post about topics all you want, just like what's happening in this thread. You just can't try to maliciously fork the Bitcoin network by completely skipping the working peer-review process and promoting chain-split inducing client implementations. Which is pretty reasonable. Why would a pro-Bitcoin subreddit tolerate vehemently anti-Bitcoin propaganda and attacks?
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:34:07
This is incorrect. SegWit doesn't make transactions smaller (in fact, it makes them very very slightly bigger). 
SegWit is a blocksize increase. Period.

I likewise appreciate that you took the time to hear me out, and didn't just fire back with hostility.
I burned myself out on reddit a few months ago, arguing way too much about Bitcoin with users who I never stood any chance of finding common ground with. Once things got too bad and started to affect my psyche, I took a big step back and stopped coming here as often, and it improved my life noticeably. Your mileage may vary, of course, but if you're considering taking a break (even if it's just a temporary one, and even if it's just from *this* subreddit) I'd personally recommend giving it a try. Not that I don't want you here, it just tends to help in terms of perspective.
And yeah, if I'm being completely honest, I too miss the days where the Buttcoin brigade was the nastiest opposition any Bitcoiner really had to face. Stuff is so much more complicated than "fart jokes and schadenfreude" these days.

He never explained his reasoning publicly. He did say that the minrelayfee (which is not consensus-critical, and is instead a per-node relay policy) was the "first attempt at addressing network spam" when it was added a few months after the 1MB limit was put in place, so we can rule out "spam" as the reason. 
Really, if you take a step back and look at it objectively, the only purpose that the 1MB limit really serves is to restrict the power of miners in the system. It serves as a growth boundary, forcing the system to remain as lightweight as possible as consensus is reached in terms of "how can we most intelligently scale this thing?"... so far, it is doing its job remarkably well.
I also personally suspect that Satoshi might have simultaneously put it there for social reasons; Bitcoin must necessarily develop a distributed governance system if it is to survive in the long term, and if the power of any one component in this system far outweighs that of the others, we're back to square one and the Bitcoin experiment failed. The blocksize limit seems like a pretty clever Trojan Horse in terms of a lesson in navigating distributed governance before the bigger Wars start being fought. Satoshi disappearing was the first trial, reaching consensus on the blocksize limit is the second, and responding to nation-state level threats in some way will likely be the third.
Mind you, that last paragraph is all just my personal ramblings, since we were on the subject anyway.

It's contentious because it is a massive blocksize increase, which many believe is a bad idea for a number of reasons. It is contentious because it is a hard fork on a rushed schedule. It is contentious because there is no replay protection implemented, and no intent to implement any. It is contentious because it was an agreement signed behind closed doors, deliberately made excluding any community and/or developer representation. It is contentious because *there isn't even a BIP for the fork*. It is contentious because it literally has *one* serious developer, and that developer has practically *zero* experience with writing consensus-critical code (and has already demonstrated on a number of occasions to not understand even the basics of the code he is trying to modify), and his commits are few and far between. It is contentious because there were never any actual technical arguments in favor of it. 
It is unambiguously contentious, and not just circularly.

This was answered three comments ago. From the consumer's perspective, the ability to chargeback is objectively preferable than the lack of ability to do so. 
Read my responses and think about them for a minute before trying to type up a reply. You're clearly not taking the time to think here.


Yes, obviously. I see that you are not very well informed on this subject, if this is news to you. You need to do a great deal of research to get up to speed enough to take part in this discussion, I see. I don't have the time to educate every uninformed newbie around here, though, so I think our time together may be drawing to a close. 


I have not indicated *any* excitement about educating newbies. Doing so became tiresome years ago (there are just *so many* of you)! Again, you need to read my responses and think about what I'm saying, rather than firing off a response without understanding what you're responding to.

Nope, Lightning doesn't "require" larger block sizes at all. What a silly fallacious claim.

If the question is instead "doesn't it just take a couple of lines of code to program a hard fork safely?" the answer is **no, dear God, no, not at all**.

Yes, that's a totally valid concern, and a big part of why Bitcoin is considered a "risky" investment. There's no guarantee that it'll keep the throne forever.
In my opinion, whether Bitcoin remains King of Crypto depends on what the most important "fundamentals" are, in the long-term. If censorship-resistance and immutability are the biggest drivers of blockchain value, then Bitcoin's resistance to change (inertia) is a good thing, and might very well be the distinguishing property that other coins and efforts are unable to clone. If, on the other hand, flexibility and contextual responsiveness are the biggest drivers of blockchain growth and value, then it is probably going to be a more "nimble" coin that takes over. The current crowd favorite is Ethereum, but there are other initiatives that take similar approaches, and any one of them could "hit it big" at any time, if things work out just right.
These are the types of questions that keep me up at night (not in a bad way, just in a "can't quiet my mind down" sort of way). It's fascinating stuff, and there are valid arguments on all sides.

I apologize for the condescension, you're right, that was an asshole way to finish off my comment. That particular misconception ("SegWit doesn't increase the blocksize, it's just an accounting trick") is a pet peeve of mine, because it's so easily debunkable and yet people still keep repeating it. 


Actually, no, that's another misconception. The main technical issues that result from increasing the maximum blocksize (other than increased node operating costs) concern the quadratic scaling of sigops and the growth of the UTXO set, both of which are important concerns for a number of reasons. Widespread SegWit usage would improve/fix both.
Another benefit of SegWit is that with it, a single limit is applied to the weighted sum of the UTXO data and the witness data, allowing both to be limited simultaneously as a combined entity.
And finally, SegWit allows SPV-esque nodes to ignore (skip the downloading of) the witness data, which would considerably mitigate the data-storage and bandwidth drawbacks of larger blocks.
For each of these reasons, a blocksize increase would be much safer, less controversial, and advantageous *after* SegWit is activated (and used) on the network.
I have seen the argument that "Since blocks with SegWit active can be up to 4MB in size, but it expected to only increase capacity by 70-100%, it costs the network 4x as much as it should, which would make future blocksize increases more costly" but this is actually another misconception and myth that is just an indication of ignorance. It's the equivalent of "having your cake and eating it too" (but in a negative sense), and beyond that, it entirely misses the mark on what the scaling risks actually are in Bitcoin, on a technical level. In short, any 3MB blocks on a SegWit-active blockchain would be achieving the same capacity that 3MB blocks in a hard-forked blocksize-increase blockchain would (i.e. **200%** rather than 70%) but with SegWit, such blocks would incur substantially less technical debt and other vulnerabilities.

Selling/offloading BCH and accumulating BTC is a smart way to get the most out of the respective tokens.
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:44:31


The basic technological design (an open, decentralized, and incentive-propelled token network and timestamp chain) is essentially *identical* for both Bitcoin and almost any serious altcoin.
There are a number of attractive components to the value proposition that *Bitcoin as a whole* represents, but relatively few of these have anything to do with the fundamentals of the technology underpinning it. Make no mistake, though: in Bitcoin's case, the technology *is* marginally superior to any given altcoin *at achieving what Bitcoin achieves*, by virtue of its value relative to (and obvious influence upon) any other alternative network or coin and the various feedback loops that monies, networks, open-source codebases, and work- (or stake-) based security models enjoy. The tricky thing to grok here, especially for people who don't actually write code for a living (or have a degree of some sort in the computer sciences), is that at the protocol level pretty much any technical changes or distinctions made will result in *trade-offs*. To apologetically generalize: you can tweak the specific implementational approach as much as you want, but even in the most worthwhile attempts at doing so, you'll pretty much always make some things better and other things worse. Bitcoin is definitely not *perfect* in any meaningful sense, it's just *viable* in a very serious sense, and has been relentlessly parameterized and optimized for a particular function (namely, to be the Money of the Internet) from day one.
Again, despite that tangent there, allow me to reiterate the main point: as a speculative bet or investment, allocating capital into Bitcoin is a smart move versus allocating it into most altcoins, and the specific tech itself is just one component of a larger whole.
Now, with that said (and reiterated), if you've done your research and thought things through, making sure you thoroughly understand Bitcoin and what it offers versus a particular altcoin and what *it* does, then no one is going to fault you for choosing to allocate your personal capital into that altcoin (as an alternative or complement to your capital in Bitcoin). You might very well *like* the types of trade-offs that the altcoin's designers chose to make, even if it boils down to an ideological or philosophical distinction. Far more often than not, though, the vocal advocates for almost any altcoin (and while we're on the subject, this probably holds true for Bitcoin, too, sadly) are woefully uninformed (or worse, severely *mis*informed) and totally unable to appreciate any wisp of knowledge or insight that runs contrary to the impression that they've initially formed, whether that's as negative as "It's all a giant ponzi scheme, the whole crypto thing is a total sham run by scammers" or as positive as "Bank adoption will make XRP tokens moon!"
In my experience, the people who have put the *most* comprehensive and well-reasoned thought into the subject seem to have inevitably agreed with the conclusion that I myself reached after many months and years of serious consideration: Bitcoin has presented the best expected value (EV) in the game since its launch, and no matter what other project I investigate, I inevitably find details (be they high- or low-level) that deviate from "the Bitcoin formula" in appreciably unfavorable ways, if only to my personal perspective.
You might disagree. Your experience might differ. That's okay if so, but if you're the rare fellow who has actually fully appreciated Bitcoin and what it is and does well, and after much careful thought has *still* decided that one or more altcoins offers a better long-term value proposition, please understand that you are most definitely in the drowned-out minority and that the overwhelming bulk of the rest of your community is generally not so knowledgeable, impressive, or even worth corresponding with.

TL;DR: I asked him to address the fact that Satoshi preemptively labeled Bitcoin Unlimited "a menace to the network" as well as voicing his support of SegWit-style upgrades. Roger responded by saying that Satoshi must have meant that he supported the total usurpation of Bitcoin Core by alternative clients e.g. Bitcoin Unlimited. He did not address the SegWit point.
I took the liberty of archiving the post, as it proves Roger's complete and total insincerity. Until today, I had assumed he was sincere and well-meaning, if misguided. This has taught me that I was wrong: he obviously doesn't believe the things he says, which is hard evidence of malicious intent.

No, that's not at all how it works. For every nonce you try on one chain, you are forgoing the opportunity to try one on the other. Even if the combined value of both coins is net positive, you are only able to mine one at a time; you don't magically get to mine both simultaneously.

It depends on the implementation of the blocksize increase, of course, and the risks it entails. Right now, the only serious proposal for a blocksize increase is SegWit. Everything else that has been proposed is, from an engineering and risk-management perspective, a total joke. 
Not a single person who knows what they're talking about has put forth a hard-fork blocksize increase proposal (much less an implementation), and the amateurish proposals that *have* been pitched have not survived even cursory levels of peer review.

If Bitcoin is the money of the future, then your **purchasing power** is going to increase if you acquire it relatively early on as compared to the purchasing power you would have achieved by acquiring USD instead. Because the dollar is so ubiquitous (and still the de facto global reserve currency), it currently represents a very understandable measure of purchasing power in society, and thus serves as a metric by which Bitcoin's trading value can be assessed or quantified.
An intelligent person would care about how much USD they can get for each bitcoin they possess because (at least for now) that *also* tells them how many *goods and/or services* they can exchange that coin for. Ultimately, this is the utility that money provides. It allows us to store up or accumulate our purchasing power for later acquisitions or exchanges.
Why would anyone ever sell? There are plenty of good reasons to do so. Perhaps your investment portfolio needs a rebalancing according to your (ideally pre-established) risk tolerance profile or preferences. Perhaps your target returns have been hit or exceeded, and you're sticking to your investment plan by realizing your profits. Perhaps your car broke down and needs an expensive fix-up, and the most conveniently accessible savings vehicle at your disposal are your bitcoins. Perhaps you are temporarily withdrawing from the market after having concluded that the near-term future will have a bearish bias (and perhaps you're doing so with the expectation or hope of being able to buy *more* bitcoins with the same capital a few weeks or months later). Perhaps you have discovered a different industry or asset class that you estimate will yield even better returns than Bitcoin over the time horizons that are relevant to you.
You sell when it makes sense to. The same goes for when you buy.

@_date: 2018-06-09 17:45:54


Not only is this untrue, it is **incredibly** untrue and shows beyond doubt that you don't actually have a basic understanding of how Bitcoin works.
**Every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract.** Not only that, but complex and flexible smart contracting is possible on Bitcoin (e.g. multisignature contracts and HTLCs which allow networked payment channels to work) and privacy-preserving, payload-reducing techniques like MAST (most promisingly through Taproot and Graftroot) are poised to extend and improve upon the status quo in this regard.
Pretty much any meaningful and realistic smart contract will rely on a (trusted or pseudo-trusted) oracle component for blockchain-external data sourcing, which means that almost all interesting contracts boil down to multisignature arrangements in the end. Making the contract scripting language Turing expressive (or "richly stateful" to use the newest position of the buzzword goalposts) creates more problems without solving any others; it represents a step in the *wrong* direction.
Of course, to appreciate this, you have to have a basic understanding of the subject (or arguably an in-depth one), which most people unfortunately lack.


Ethereum is not "much faster" than Bitcoin, and this further demonstrates misunderstanding on your part. I assume you mean that the block interval is shorter, but don't mistake this for speed (because that's not what it represents).


If we're interested in Bitcoin (or any crypto) because of its potential as an investment or store of value, then we want to be sure it is definitively scarce in the long-term; the only way to be sure of that is to know that it can possibly be so and still function. Relatively high fees, then, imply that it *can* be so (because transactional demand is less elastic than you might initially assume), which means that this is *a good thing* for Bitcoin versus any given alternative.
This is another painfully-misunderstood element; people who haven't been thinking about this stuff deeply tend to assume "high fees, uh oh, that's bad" when, if they'd spend some more time thinking about it, they'd realize that they have it exactly backwards.
In any case, minimizing individual transaction costs over long term time horizons *is* important, which is why the Bitcoin stack is being built to efficiently achieve and facilitate this. But not on the bottom layer, where an intelligent treatment of priorities demands security, robustness, and core-value preservation. Any other approach is myopic to the point of ridiculousness.

Ten minutes is absolutely *not* the minimum. Ten minutes is the statistical average. Actually, due to exponentially increasing hashrate and a 2-week retargeting period, the actual average in practice is *lower* than ten minutes. Blocks are often mined within seconds of one another.

@_date: 2016-11-16 00:02:36


You can only do this by outbidding all of those normal users in a free market competition. And as long as you pay higher fees than the rest of the network, you *should* be given higher confirmation priority.
That's kind of the whole point behind fees in the first place. It's how Bitcoin is built to work. 
The nice thing about this is that any such attacker has to outbid **the entire network** at a **sustained rate**, whereas any individual transactor can just outbid the attacker on any individual transaction. If the attacker tries to up the ante even further, they can essentially be bankrupted at very little cost to the rest of the network (other than temporary congestion). In the end, it would amount to a giant donation to the miners out of the attacker's pockets. And then the fees would once again settle down into the (much much lower) equilibrium state.
This is pretty basic stuff. Satoshi was talking about it in 2009 and 2010. It's not really an "attack vector" as it is a form of totally-legitimate network usage. 
Free market, yo.

Smart contracts are only relevant to humans insofar as they result in transfers of ownership. Whether the contract occurs on Bitcoin or some altcoin doesn't change this.


Multisig, timelocks, arithmetical functions, hash/secret-locks, syntax trees, etc.


First, it doesn't seem like you fully understand the "range of functionality" supported by Bitcoin's Script.
Furthermore, "most people" probably aren't even aware of the term "smart contract" at all. Of those that *are* aware of the phrase, the majority probably got their "knowledge" via some altcoin's marketing material, and are under the mistaken impression that their altcoin is "Turing complete", and suffer from [fundamental misunderstandings on the subject](
If you're trying to point out that most people are ignorant or clueless when it comes to this stuff, unfortunately that's true. Which is why I pointed out Bitcoin's smart contracting capabilities above; educating the less-informed is something we should try our best to do.

No, you're repeating a myth. SegWit increases the maximum blocksize to 4MB. That is how there are so many [3.7 MB blocks on the Testnet]( where SegWit is already active. If you run a SegWit node, an individual Bitcoin block can take up 3.7MB of your disk space. You can fit a maximum of 6000-8000 transactions in a SegWit block, and a maximum of 1000-2500 transactions in a pre-SegWit block. SegWit-transactions are no smaller than non-SegWit transactions.
Go check out the block explorer link I've provided to confirm that everything I have said is true. Or, even better, start up a node on Testnet, and then look at the size of your Bitcoin data directory. You can confirm everything that I have told you firsthand, you don't have to take my word for it.
I'm glad to help teach you this stuff. If you have more questions, let me know.

Lightning Network still requires transactions on chain...
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:12:17
Yes, it would have been very simple to change one line of code and break Bitcoin completely.
Are you really that ignorant? Have you really not learned, after all these years, why merely "changing a constant" would open up numerous new attack vectors and risks, and how every implementation which tried to just "change a constant" has actually wound up changing *more* code than SegWit, in amateurish attempts to plug some of these security holes? Are you aware of how these attempts have accidentally forked themselves off testnet, and had to stop running a testnet altogether because of how badly they broke things? Is this all news to you?

From [the whitepaper]( itself:


Satoshi [also said]( *very* early on, in response to theymos' asking "Is the fee enough to always ensure the profitability of running a node, even when BitCoin generation stops being profitable?":


Here you can see that Satoshi *explicitly* mentions "a few decades" and "20 years" as the relevant time horizons over which the transition from block-reward-subsidy to fee-based incentives occurs. He is also explicitly acknowledging that the transition to a fee-based network is in order to protect the finitude of the network tokens.
This, alone, proves my point. 
I'll keep going, though, to give you plenty of references if you're interested in learning more about this.
[More from Satoshi on this subject](








transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value from 
any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client 
software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended 
payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive value 
when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in 
the block.


[Satoshi also said]( "There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by 
transaction fees alone" and "With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted, nodes would have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive." 
Moving past just Satoshi references (after all, this isn't an appeal-to-authority, I'm merely explaining how Bitcoin is envisioned to work over the long term, and demonstrating that this has been well understood in the community since the very beginning)...
In the very first section on ["Bitcoin Basics"]( you will see:


From the same wiki, the [Transaction fee]( page explains:


And [from the wiki FAQ](

Here are some analyses regarding the transition from block-reward (inflation-based) incentives to transaction fee incentives, in the long term, and the effects this will have on Bitcoin mining:

Oh, dear, the child is trying to argue with me now. Well, if you insist...
Let's grab a quote or two from your "article", shall we?


Sure sounds a lot like "2MB hard fork because otherwise Bitcoin will die" doesn't it?
And the specific section you're referring to *actually* says:


Yeah, totally valid praise and not just some juvenile attempt at an obfuscated criticism.
Later, the ignorance is palpable:


What a joke. The article doesn't even suggest a specific implementation of the above approach. Presumably the preferred implementation is Bitcoin Classic, considering that is the only proposal with any code that qualifies the "one-off increase to 2MB", but Bitcoin Classic is the **exact opposite** of a thoroughly tested solution. A few months ago, Bitcoin Classic **forked** on the testnet because Bitcoin Unlimited falsely signalled BIP109 support. Today, there is no Bitcoin Classic testnet. In fact, as a result of the aforementioned fiasco and fork, large chunks of Bitcoin Classic's vulnerability-patching logic were disabled/removed. It is a buggy, stripped-down, and known-to-be-vulnerable codebase at this point, which is why it has been pretty much abandoned by its former developers (just like its predecessor XT) and the ignorant "hard fork at all costs" demographic started supporting Bitcoin Unlimited instead. 
An example of a "thoroughly tested solution" is SegWit. SegWit is able to boast multiple BIPs of precise specification, well over a year of testnet experience (on multiple different testnets), comprehensive test coverage, and thorough peer review by a large and dedicated team of top-tier engineers. SegWit is a clean and elegant solution, which is why the engineers picked it. Now they've tested it. It is the *only* scaling option that has been tested sufficiently for rapid deployment. There is no hard fork code that has been tested or vetted, so if we wanted to hard fork (and by and large it seems we don't) it would take another year, optimistically, before we would be ready to start signaling for activation.


Lightning Network development is wrapping up already; the creators have already predicted a working release this winter. There are multiple different teams, working on client implementations in parallel, who have coordinated to come to this estimate. The last big thing we're waiting on is SegWit activation, and signalling starts in about a week.
And, once again, there *are* no viable short-term scaling solutions other than SegWit. *If* we decided to code a (not incredibly misguided, vulnerable and sloppy) hard fork to 2MB block limits for whatever reason, it wouldn't happen for at least another year. 


This makes no sense. *Any* marginal increase in the size limit would incur marginal bandwidth demands and latency disadvantages. There is no escaping that. If you could magically transmit 2MB at the cost of 1MB, there would be nothing to discuss. We'd just do that ad infinitum.
I could keep going, but there's no need. My point is made. This article would be outright embarrassing for any self-respecting adult. Like I said, if you're midway through high school, it makes more sense, and I can cut you some slack. But this is just sloppy writing, fumbling to communicate even sloppier reasoning.

@_date: 2016-11-13 01:13:46
You have entirely missed the point. The lone entity could *be* the miner. The issue here is *not* the profit margins of the miner. The issue is that the cost of including any given transaction is borne by every fully-validating node; each confirmed transaction, therefore, represents a distinct (and relatively profound) **externality**. Google that word if you don't understand the preceding statement.
Which is preferable: a datastore that you have to pay to host, which can potentially disappear, or a datastore that others will pay to host for you, which is basically permanent? The answer is obvious. So we know, *at minimum*, that the miners who find the blocks have an incentive to include their own transactions as a mechanism to achieve permanent, immutable, cost-free storage. 
And thus: **A persistent pool of unconfirmed pending transactions is the natural equilibrium state of a healthy and growing Bitcoin.**
This isn't an opinion. This is just a proper understanding of incentives.

No, that's the "witness stripped block" and it's only sent to older (non-SegWit-ready) clients. They make up less than 5% of the network at this point, if I'm not mistaken.

**False.** False false false false false.
If old, un-upgraded nodes are forked off the majority chain and orphaned (regardless of how few of them there are), then it was a consensus-breaking change.


**False.** False false false false false.
This is the entire distinction between a soft fork and a hard fork - it is literally the definition of a soft fork that it does *not* break consensus with old, un-upgraded nodes.
You are **severely** confused about the concept of consensus on a technical level. You should take some time to educate yourself before trying to argue about this stuff, you come across as embarrassingly ignorant right now.


It's good to ask these questions, but generally try to do so *before* you start trying to weigh in on such matters.
Network consensus refers to universal recognition and agreement on the state of the valid chain (i.e. ledger). If someone made a change to their node software which allowed it to accept blocks up to 2MB in size, then a 1.5MB block would be considered valid according to their node, but invalid according to the rest of the network. In this scenario, that individual node would be "out of consensus" due to the consensus-breaking change they made in their software.


I don't see this as convenient, *at all*. It is a huge nuisance, and one I deal with on a daily basis.
Anyone who disagrees with "1+1=2" is ignorant with regards to arithmetic. It's not "convenient" for me, as someone who *does* understand arithmetic, that such a person exists and tries to argue on reddit. In fact, it is inconvenient and bothersome. But in the interest of truth and honesty, I will take time out of my day to correct the ignorance and falsehood that such a person tries to spread, *especially* if that person goes through the effort of "campaigning" their arithmetical misconceptions through sockpuppet accounts, astroturfing, and other such underhanded activities.

What does this even mean? Bitcoin uses open market competition to establish fee rates; if you want to introduce a deviation from this formula (to inject an "artificial" element), you're describing a new system altogether. If you can get others to choose or prefer your new system, great for you. But that's not how Bitcoin was designed or built to work.


People can sell whatever possessions they want (bitcoins, flakes of gold, computers, shampoo). You're not making sense.


Price will go up as long as demand outstrips supply.


Instead of desperately trying to strawman others' arguments, perhaps try *actually understanding* them instead.
Ensuring Bitcoin can continue to operate as the block subsidy dwindles to negligible levels and striving to make sure that the cost of transacting with Bitcoin is economically feasible (and sustainable) are not mutually exclusive goals. If you haven't spent the time to understand the basics (for instance, if you're so comically uninformed that you think Bitcoin lacks smart contracts, or that lower block intervals make arbitrary altcoins "faster" than Bitcoin in any meaningful sense) then you're going to have an *extremely* difficult time understanding the more advanced and nuanced matters like this one.

I'd be surprised to hear of a use case that *wasn't* covered, honestly. At least, if we factor in an oracle of any sort, any predicate you might want to satisfy can be satisfied by their input on an appropriate multisignature construct.
In fact, I expect such services to flourish later on down the line, after the world at large gets an honest grip on the Bitcoin paradigm. As for now, we're not even fully out of the "blockchain not bitcoin" phase, so it's very much still early days. This is a young industry, and the knee-jerk reaction of most jealous fools is something along the lines of: "I know, I'll outwit the market... instead of investing in *Bitcoin*, I'll invest in *othercoin*, which is better than Bitcoin because it's [faster/more-general/cheaper/more-private/funnier/greener/more-Bitcoin/sexier]". This without ever bothering to appreciate what makes Bitcoin special, and why it was built the way that it is, in the first place. Until the supply of such fools gets dwarfed by those who appreciate what's happening, we have philosophical room to grow.
To be clear, Bitcoin hosted ICOs, blockchain-based gambling apps, metacoins, networked payment channels, etc. before any altcoins ever did. As it turns out, "money" is the killer app, and most of the other cool stuff comes later, after that critical "becoming money" step is completed. And make no mistake, it is not... not yet, at least. Fortunately, it *can* be, eventually, mostly thanks to Bitcoin's supply characteristics relative to all other incumbent monetary bases. If it continues to work as advertised on the tin (and no, "fee-free on the base chain for everyone" isn't a critical part of that, considering the long-term plan for chain security and the practical solutions to micropayments available), then it can maintain a price-appreciation feedback loop, which in turn provides the answer to the fundamental chicken-or-egg problem facing Bitcoin or anything like it: *why value this money over existing and ubiquitous monies (like dollars)?* The obvious and uncontested answer, of course, being the gains that are possible if adoption of the new money continues to occur. 
Honestly, the way this plays out, and has played out, is: first, some nerds experiment and brainstorm and prototype. These are followed by less-scrupulous (and generally less-brilliant) but more marketing-focused nerds borrowing/stealing from their output. This second wave preys on the naive, until it gradually registers that in general, deviating from the new monetary standard isn't a long-term profitable strategy. Then, as the medium-of-exchange and unit-of-account use cases become truly possible for the first time, the one or two best efforts from the earlier waves will inspire the mass-market success stories which get deployed on the mature and stable infrastructure. Most likely, the overwhelming majority of these services will be considerably more economical and user-friendly when implemented and offered in a centralized way. Even more importantly, in the instances where this doesn't hold true, it will probably always make more sense, from a cost-conscious user's perspective, to use a reliable oracle-arbitrated payout contract than to rely upon a machine-enforced contract, stipulated in a language that the user isn't qualified to even *read*, much less *audit*, which will almost certainly ultimately require an oracle's arbitration/input anyway. 
In the end, we're in a situation where the nuances of the domain make it very difficult for those who aren't domain experts ("domain experts" being those who were designing and building cryptosystems before Bitcoin even showed up) to meaningfully evaluate what makes sense and what doesn't, as far as smart contracts and the practical applications thereof. This is highly unfortunate in a fast-moving, lucrative industry, and for a while, razzle-dazzling buyers was the fastest way to get rich, so we're left recovering in the aftermath of a coin-shill-armageddon.
In short, Bitcoin has more than enough smart contracting capability to be able to support the contracts that a future economy would ever need to be settled at the chain layer directly. The killer app is *money*, not redundant computation. Economically efficient layers and solutions will form from the ashes of the experiments that preceded them, and trying to "invest" in blockchain initiatives besides Bitcoin at this stage is likely exceptionally premature, all things considered, and will result in losses far more often than not (at least when denominating in terms of Bitcoin opportunity cost), as we've seen demonstrated year after year since 2009.

A block's "ID" or hash is generated from the contents of its header. Without the Merkle root in it, the block header would not commit to or include *any* of the transactions in the block; the hash would simply be generated from a version number, a timestamp, a nonce, and an earlier block hash. You would then have a distributed timestamp server/chain (with no incentive to extend it), but not a decentralized electronic cash.
TL;DR: it makes the block hash include the block's transactions (committing the block's proof of work to those transactions).

Not only is this untrue, it is **incredibly** untrue and shows beyond doubt that you don't actually have a basic understanding of how Bitcoin works.
**Every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract.** Not only that, but complex and flexible smart contracting is possible on Bitcoin (e.g. multisignature contracts and HTLCs which allow networked payment channels to work) and privacy-preserving, payload-reducing techniques like MAST (most promisingly through Taproot and Graftroot) are poised to extend and improve upon the status quo in this regard.
Pretty much any meaningful and realistic smart contract will rely on a (trusted or pseudo-trusted) oracle component for blockchain-external data sourcing, which means that almost all interesting contracts boil down to multisignature arrangements in the end. Making the contract scripting language Turing expressive (or "richly stateful" to use the newest position of the buzzword goalposts) creates more problems without solving any others; it represents a step in the *wrong* direction.
Of course, to appreciate this, you have to have a basic understanding of the subject (or arguably an in-depth one), which most people unfortunately lack.

First things first, "distributed" and "decentralized" have [subtly different meanings]( and in the case of Lightning Network, it is shaping up as a textbook example of a "decentralized" network. Please try to familiarize yourself with the terminology before weighing in on this stuff.


Simply put: because it is not a custodial, trust-based model, and thus represents a *huge* leap forward from the status quo. Furthermore, ensuring base-level decentralization/distribution is maximized by pushing centralizing forces and factors up into the (modular, easy-to-swap-out) higher layers of the technological stack is the logical and rational way to expand and build the Bitcoin network.
It sounds like you have a *lot* of reading and learning to do before you're really ready to discuss the Lightning Network competently. If you'd like a few resource suggestions to get you started, let me know.

Actually, Bitcoin uses an unsigned integer for the timestamp, and gets an extra 68 years of leeway with the extra bit. It's a "year 2106 problem" instead.

You seem to be struggling with what I'm saying. Take a step back and think about this for a minute. The blocksize is a good thing for Bitcoin, it keeps the cost of running a node manageable. It is not having a deleterious effect; it is *helping* Bitcoin.
In your comment here, you are conflating the maximum blocksize with capacity, which is a dangerously naive thing to do. Hypothetically (and understand that this is purposefully far-fetched and extreme, to demonstrate the principle of the matter) if someone came up with a "transaction supercompression" technique which allowed hundreds of thousands or millions of transactions to fit inside each (1MB-limited) block, would there be any sound reasons to raise the maximum blocksize? Obviously not.
**An increase of the maximum blocksize is not in itself desirable.** Throughput capabilities and capacity are desirable, but **not** larger blocks. Take a few moments to think about this seriously.

Yes, this might be a valid solution (or maybe "patch") that ultimately *does* provide a good-enough answer to the vulnerability in question. I'd like to hear the specific implementation specifications and see some extensive peer review from the experts qualified to provide it. It is likely that the entire process (conceiving the idea, drafting a formal specification, implementing it via code, testing, debugging, and all the rounds of peer review at every step of the way) would take many months or even years. And ultimately you *are* shuffling limits around, removing or lifting some while introducing or constraining others, and it's unclear how advantageous or beneficial the final result would ultimately be.


If I can afford a processing cost, and there are competitors eating into my revenue stream who I know are not as able to do so, the incentives are aligned for me to incur more of this cost if I can. It would improve my bottom line if other miners closed up shop or were adversely affected by my exploitations, so it would be rational to exploit to the best of my ability.


No, this is not the case. There is no logic nor protection mechanisms in BU that mitigate the gradual and wilful incurrence of higher full-node processing costs by miners.

That's not part of the definition of electronic cash, actually. "Electronic cash" or "e-cash" is a term of art in cryptography, and something the cypherpunks discussed and experimented a great deal with.

Back in 2014 and 2015 when "merchant adoption" headlines were commonplace, plenty of people were quick to celebrate and proclaim that X, Y, and Z were "accepting Bitcoin!" when, of course, no merchants were actually doing so (with the notable exception of Overstock, as I mentioned above).
Many of us chimed in to say: "This isn't actually merchant adoption and represents zero new Bitcoin demand as long as the business(es) on the other end of the payment processor are only ever receiving dollars." The less insightful people (which it seems like you count yourself among) didn't listen to us (surprise, surprise), and are now confused and/or worried about non-news as a result.

If you see the phrase "non sequitur" and your reaction is "Why is this person trying so hard to appear intellectual?" that is pretty hilarious in and of itself. Your standard of discourse must be *incredibly* low (which is corroborated by our exchange here, in fact).


Apparently it's not *that* easy, because you have failed to understand pretty much every single thing that I've said so far. I'll re-cap a miniature highlights reel of the insights that have apparently soared over your head so far: 
1) Every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract. Not only that, but complex and flexible smart contracting is possible on Bitcoin (e.g. multisignature contracts and HTLCs which allow networked payment channels to work) and privacy-preserving, payload-reducing techniques like MAST (most promisingly through Taproot and Graftroot) are poised to extend and improve upon the status quo in this regard.
2) Pretty much any meaningful and realistic smart contract will rely on a (trusted or pseudo-trusted) oracle component for blockchain-external data sourcing, which means that almost all interesting contracts boil down to multisignature arrangements in the end. Making the contract scripting language Turing expressive (or "richly stateful" to use the newest position of the buzzword goalposts) creates more problems without solving any others; it represents a step in the wrong direction.
3) Ethereum is not "much faster" than Bitcoin, and this further demonstrates misunderstanding on your part. I assume you mean that the block interval is shorter, but don't mistake this for speed (because that's not what it represents).
4) If we're interested in Bitcoin (or any crypto) because of its potential as an investment or store of value, then we want to be sure it is definitively scarce in the long-term; the only way to be sure of that is to know that it can possibly be so and still function. Relatively high fees, then, imply that it can be so (because transactional demand is less elastic than you might initially assume), which means that this is a good thing for Bitcoin versus any given alternative.
5) This is another painfully-misunderstood element; people who haven't been thinking about this stuff deeply tend to assume "high fees, uh oh, that's bad" when, if they'd spend some more time thinking about it, they'd realize that they have it exactly backwards.
6) In any case, minimizing individual transaction costs over long term time horizons is important, which is why the Bitcoin stack is being built to efficiently achieve and facilitate this. But not on the bottom layer, where an intelligent treatment of priorities demands security, robustness, and core-value preservation. Any other approach is myopic to the point of ridiculousness.
7) Bitcoin's smart contracts are not turing complete. --&gt; Neither are Ethereum's, if you want to get technical and precise about it.
8) Bitcoin uses open market competition to establish fee rates; if you want to introduce a deviation from this formula (to inject an "artificial" element), you're describing a new system altogether. If you can get others to choose or prefer your new system, great for you. But that's not how Bitcoin was designed or built to work.
9) People can sell whatever possessions they want (bitcoins, flakes of gold, computers, shampoo).
10) Price will go up as long as demand outstrips supply.
11) Ensuring Bitcoin can continue to operate as the block subsidy dwindles to negligible levels and striving to make sure that the cost of transacting with Bitcoin is economically feasible (and sustainable) are not mutually exclusive goals. 
12) If you haven't spent the time to understand the basics (for instance, if you're so comically uninformed that you think Bitcoin lacks smart contracts, or that lower block intervals make arbitrary altcoins "faster" than Bitcoin in any meaningful sense) then you're going to have an extremely difficult time understanding the more advanced and nuanced matters like this one.
13) It depends. What other considerations are there, besides fees?
14) Bitcoin represents a particular promise and value proposition which no other system is currently even trying to offer.
15) You're bundling in assumptions into your question. This is called a "loaded question" and it demonstrates a logical breakdown.
16) Satoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining in the Bitcoin whitepaper itself... Just because you didn't understand the vision doesn't mean that the vision changed along the way. It's going strong as ever.
17) As explained above, [Bitcoin exhibiting relatively high fees] is not a problem, this is an encouraging signal that Bitcoin is sustainable, and a positive development.
That's seventeen distinct points that you have failed to grok. I have been thoroughly responding to your every misconception, and patiently trying to work with you to help you to see where you've gone wrong. You repeatedly respond with non sequiturs and haphazard subject changes, and have exhibited a pattern of failing to acknowledge the points that have been continually provided to help you.
You tried to strawman what I was saying, followed by a false dichotomy, a loaded question, and a string of non sequiturs. Now you've trotted out more strawmen ("You may just as well say the world is flat") and flaccid attempts at ad hominem attacks. You are apparently intent on refusing to read anything that I am explaining to you, and you've outright admitted that you're trying to be childish.
You appear to be here to troll, rather than engage in honest dialogue or discourse. This subreddit isn't the right place for it, though, so if you keep at it, you could very well find yourself temporarily (or even permanently) banned as a result. Consider yourself warned: hostile and juvenile trolling isn't welcome here.


Yes, it is indeed a p2p digital cash system.
Electronic/digital cash is a [term of art]( in cryptography, which can be traced back to [Chaum](
Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer** implementation of e-cash. Its distinguishing property being that it is fundamentally decentralized, and that anyone is free to run a node themselves in order to participate in the network without going through trusted third parties or intermediaries. The proper emphasis should therefore be: "Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"


I have repeatedly explained that this is a misunderstanding on your part. Once you have internalized this, we can proceed.


Fees have never gotten "so high that the system became unusable" and Bitcoin has been working beautifully this entire time. No "steps back" were made in any regard; Bitcoin is stronger than it has ever been.


Fees themselves are *not* a problem. As Satoshi said in the *Incentive* section of the whitepaper (section 6):


If you don't like the idea of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator, you are free to look elsewhere for something that you *do* like.


Yes, it is perfectly okay that I agree with Satoshi and work towards the fulfillment of his vision.


I have already provided you a number of citations which prove that Bitcoin was designed and modeled after gold to begin with (it says so in the whitepaper, and Satoshi reiterated this on numerous occasions) and that digital cash does not mean "different from gold" or even "low in terms of fees" but instead simply denotes that the system is an online transactional protocol which makes use of the exchange of cryptographic signatures for ownership and transfers.


It's perfectly okay for me to understand Bitcoin. Whether or not *you* are okay with *not* understanding it is another matter.


You can't convince me of things that are false when I know the truth of the matter. You especially can't do so with a long string of obvious logical fallacies.


It sounds like you have a fairly anemic vocabulary, and that you're dimly aware of this fact. I'm amused, but I also feel a little bad for you.

Personally, I don't trust this. I suspect you're right that it's a publicity stunt and that the handle will continue to be used to trash Bitcoin and shill a particular altcoin. However, I'm not flagging any of these posts (and neither are any of the other mods right now, that I can see) because they aren't breaking any rules, they are Bitcoin-relevant in a sense, and they aren't completely overwhelming the front page at the moment.
So I think it's less that we "want this out in the open" and more that there isn't a clear reason to flag/remove it. My personal suspicions and distrust of the situation aren't sufficient grounds for removing these submissions, and there's always the possibility/hope that this really is what it seems, and the  Twitter handle will start being used to tweet about and champion Bitcoin. We'll see, I suppose.

What is "it"? You're really not making sense.

This was not the only time [he likened Bitcoin to gold]( either. He clearly thought that Bitcoin should and would be treated as an investment, saying: "It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."
Just because you didn't understand the vision doesn't mean that the vision changed along the way. It's going strong as ever.

Don't worry, the size limit was increased (more than doubled) from the old 1MB limit a couple of years ago. The new limit is more flexible and accommodates significantly more transactions, and in fact we haven't even yet taken full advantage of the new on-chain capacity.

Core has put out a blocksize increase (SegWit) which means it can't be Bitcoin Core.
rbtc is pushing for BU (which, along with replacing Bitcoin's consensus model with a completely untested/messy/broken one, would also likely result in gargantuan blocksizes over time), so I don't think they can be called "the small-block crowd" either.
Do you mean the miners?
@_date: 2016-11-23 05:09:19
Ah, so you're one of the ones who still hasn't realized it yet. I'm not surprised!
@_date: 2016-11-19 03:47:16
Ah, I see. You're not claiming that SegWit would make a subsequent hard-fork more difficult for *technical* reasons, but rather that it would do so for *political* reasons. That's actually a totally valid perspective, and I respect where you're coming from.
I'm not aware of any Core developers who have argued that we should *never* hard-fork, but it's entirely possible that this is just because I'm not paying enough attention. I'd really appreciate it if you could link me to an example of such an argument by a Core developer (even if you just provide it via PM, to avoid a potential public witch hunt). I do understand if you don't want to bother digging around for quotes, so it's not a huge deal, but I want to take a brief moment and ask that you consider the possibility that is an accidental "strawman argument", or a case of mistakenly "reading too much between the lines". I have seen a lot of anti-Core rhetoric over the past year (some of it perhaps justified, much of it not) and overexposure to *any* narrative can have strange effects on a perspective. In fact, I think that this same phenomenon is the single best argument against theymos' censorship/moderation, but I digress.


This is *definitely* a good point, but there's a rebuttal that I worry you might be overlooking. Bitcoin Core, as an organization, would be *entirely* apolitical in a perfect world. That is to say, ideally, Core should *never* "pick sides" in any arguments, because that's not their job or role in the ecosystem; they are supposed to maintain and improve the Bitcoin software and backbone as much as possible, but not influence the ecosystem or industry beyond that. That's the role of other organizations (like the Bitcoin Foundation), and if at all possible, it would be preferable that Core sticks to writing and debugging solid code while other actors make the political decisions and actions.
In practice, the best way to uphold this ideal would be to *only* merge in code changes that are uncontroversial. Doing anything else, by definition, would be "picking a side", which is not what we want. And especially in cases where choosing a side would leave the opposing side exceptionally vulnerable (as in the case of a hard-fork, where the minority chain is permanently orphaned), this would amount to an "executive order" which is antithetical to everything that Bitcoin is supposed to represent.
Now, I can already appreciate the counterpoints to the point above: "There is no way to be entirely apolitical, that is unrealistic", "By vetoing a hard-fork, Core *is* effectively choosing sides", "Requiring the absolute lack of contention is effectively an impossible criteria to meet", etc. These are all fair arguments. But I still think it's worth taking a moment to seriously consider this point: *if* there is a controversial code change proposed that would have profound effects on Bitcoin and would potentially leave a significant subset of the userbase at risk, the "least political" option is to choose not to merge it in (i.e. reject it). In other words, the default option should be to preserve the status quo, because that is the social contract that the current users have accepted. Deviating from it is unfair to those who did not support the deviation, and to do so would amount to a "bait and switch", forcing them into a new social contract that they didn't sign up for or agree with. 
It's a lot easier to appreciate this point if you imagine that the debate is over whether we should increase the 21M coin cap or not, rather than the blocksize. I know it's not the same thing, of course, but it helps to understand why there is such opposition to contentious hard-forks.


I think that's a rather extreme conclusion to draw, but I do see where you're coming from.


The important thing to note here, though, is that the opposition to such efforts has always been supported by technical arguments. I don't think it's fair or accurate to say that Core has a history of blindly opposing hard fork proposals. It is much more accurate to say that so far, no hard fork proposals have managed to achieve widespread agreement within Core, so none have been seriously pursued yet. In contrast, SegWit *did* see rapid, widespread agreement within Core (partially because soft-forks don't incur the same risk of ostracizing significant portion of the userbase that hard-forks do)... it is only recently (after months of testing and development) that objections to SegWit have started to surface, and for the most part, the objections have been misguided and based on fundamental misunderstandings of the tech. When the best valid arguments against a code change are that it isn't the *only* upgrade that should be made, it is still fair to classify that change as "uncontroversial" in my opinion, and proceed forward in its implementation.
Sorry for the long comment, but I want to wrap up by saying that I really appreciate the dialogue here, and hearing you describe your perspective so reasonably. It's refreshing to have a civil discussion every now and then.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:17:53
The only times "Hardfork" shows up in the chart at all are for the 0.3.6, 0.3.7, and 0.8 rollouts.
v0.3.6 seems to only have been labeled as hardfork-ish because of Satoshi's upgrade recommendation, but it actually represented consensus rule *constriction*. The same goes for the 0.3.7 update to fix the spendability vulnerability. Putting "Hardfork" in the "Type" column on either of these is questionable, for obvious reasons. Personally I'd argue that both of these were softforks, but if you disagree I'm happy to hear your reasoning.
The 0.8 update is an interesting case. It can be called a hardfork, but the "consensus rule" in question was certainly not explicit, and was nondeterministic in that BDB lock limits can be manually configured with the DB_CONFIG file. This is, in my opinion, the most realistic *actual* hardfork candidate that one could argue Bitcoin has experienced, but it can very reasonably be counterargued that the implicit (and user-modifiable) database lock limits were not actually a true consensus restriction. If you really wanted to, you could get a precompiled binary of a v0.7 node to sync to today's chain tip.
It's mostly semantics, and worse, it's semantics in a blossoming new field where the terminology is continually evolving. I still think "Eh, sort of" is the best answer to the question.

Yes, but the "evil" miners could theoretically ignore that block (either entirely orphaning it on the 1.0 protocol if they had enough hashrate to do so, or simply filtering it out in the 2.0 protocol).

Bitcoin is the leading smart contract platform, actually. Lightning Network is a great example of a web of interlinked smart contracts, and it seems to be the first smart contract solution working at scale, especially if we constrain our analysis to the smart contract solutions that make economic sense or have any sort of long-term viability.
Like it or not, most of the contracts on ETH (including pretty much every ERC-based setup) are ultimately centralized in terms of control, and it's likely that as the market matures and recognizes the folly (i.e. lack of any real benefits) of this sort of arrangement, these sorts of contracts and projects will dwindle into relative oblivion accordingly.
The primary utility that Ethereum has demonstrated so far is the ability to temporarily circumvent established securities-offering regulations, but after the ICO craze in 2017, regulators have apparently taken notice and started clamping down on this sort of thing, leaving Ethereum as a "solution desperately in search of a problem" as a result. Even things like stablecoins, which the ETH community is trying to misrepresent as "totally revolutionary and awesome", aren't anything of the sort. The biggest and most successful stablecoin, by far, is Tether... which is a meta-token hosted on top of **Bitcoin**, not Ethereum. And if price-feeds are truly so important to you, a decentralized oracle solution (read: a multisignature contract) is the efficient solution you want.
Most people who are under the impression that Ethereum is "leading the way on smart contracts" are just entirely ignorant of Bitcoin's smart contracting and unwilling to educate themselves on the matter (usually because they are bagholders trying to convince themselves that they're actually early adopters of something "better than Bitcoin" when they never actually spent the time to learn about what makes Bitcoin so great in the first place).

That is 100% objectively and undeniably false. Every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract. Bitcoin is programmable and always has been.
This is what I was referring to in my comment above. You're providing a perfect example of what I meant; people who don't understand Bitcoin and who are basically just hoping that they "picked a winner" with their chosen altcoin are almost always unwilling to spend the time learning the truth about things, and would rather remain ignorant than learn that they might have made some mistaken assumptions and fallen victim to altcoin sales brochures.


Bitcoin's Script is **deliberately** designed not to be fully Turing-expressive; this is a *feature*. You can indeed use Bitcoin sidechains if you'd like to do something that isn't possible with Bitcoin's Script, but as I already pointed out above, in practice there aren't really any meaningful advantages to this sort of approach (other than, apparently, the temporary circumvention of securities regulations), and there *are* major downsides and drawbacks to it.

The blocksize limit is beneficial in multiple respects. Having a transaction-quantity-dependent dynamic limit is functionally equivalent to having no limit at all, because it is trivial for miners to generate as many transactions as they want in order to manipulate the limit as desired.
You can add in extra "incentive alignments" that make flexible/dynamic limit proposals more worthwhile (see [here]( for a decent overview on this subject), but it's also important to recognize that blocksize-limit-increases aren't actually that interesting or necessary when layer-two solutions like the Lightning Network are available. If you really prioritize low fees and/or fast transactions, it's pretty easy to get those with Bitcoin these days, and it's only getting easier and smoother as we go. Having a low(ish) limit also offers the nice benefit of encouraging improvements on (and adoption of) these second-layer solutions.
In other words, you're free to research and implement a flexcap proposal if that's what interests you, but first you would probably want to spend some time reading up on what other Bitcoin contributors have discussed along these lines, and it's more likely than not that this sort of due diligence would make you more interested in pursuing other (cooler) ideas than just a boring/clunky blocksize-oriented fork.

It would be external to the main-chain, presumably transmitted separately from the "Bitcoin 1.0" data, though it could be stored on disk and sent over any particular port however the node/client wanted.
Since the "Bitcoin 1.0" protocol isn't aware of the rules of the "Bitcoin 2.0" protocol whatsoever in the scenario Peter Todd is describing, the "Bitcoin 2.0" coins could be produced at any rate the programmer(s) designed them to be. This wouldn't affect normal bitcoins' inflation or supply, but would determine the *new* "bitcoin"s' supply instead.
Bitcoin has done a great job of resisting (and being strengthened by) various types of attacks so far, but I am personally very concerned with the possibilities of an "evil" soft fork and I consider it to be one of the scariest potential attack vectors that hasn't yet been leveraged.

Okay. Neither of those things have to do with programmability nor smart contracting, but I looked at them. The transactions per second figure is effectively infinite due to Bitcoin's smart-contracting capabilities supporting networked payment channels (as [mentioned upthread]( and the ten-minute block interval was a rational and well-reasoned design choice to minimize deadweight loss (i.e. orphaned blocks); again, payment channels (not to mention external-to-consensus risk mitigation mechanisms) allow for effectively instant transaction settlement for those who are looking to achieve this sort of thing, so it's not clear what you think "tx/s and block time" helps to demonstrate (besides your own lack of understanding).

The quantity of applications isn't nearly as important as the underlying value that these applications actually provide.
It's probably true that in terms of sheer number-of-apps, Ethereum boasts a higher figure than Bitcoin. However, the largest and most popular (and arguably the most economically valuable) smart contract in the world is built atop Bitcoin: the Lightning Network.
So far, Ethereum has mostly served as a platform to bypass securities investment regulations via ICOs, which is perhaps interesting and headline-attractive in the short-term, but not really fundamentally valuable in a long-term or sustainable sense. More recently, DeFi projects are gaining a little bit of traction and may hold genuine promise of yielding economic value, but the most successful such project is almost inarguably MakerDAI, which is just a semi-centralized stablecoin... and once again, we encounter a case where Bitcoin already has a (much bigger and more popular) offering in the same category: Tether. Tether and DAI aren't *exact* equivalents, but considering the degree of mutability of the underlying host chains, it would be hard to seriously argue that Tether is more "trusty" than DAI is (though that certainly doesn't stop the less-well-informed fanboys from trying).
What would probably help you to wrap your mind around this is to take a step back and evaluate *a priori* what the value of a public blockchain (like Bitcoin's) truly is, and how that value could best be leveraged without compromising its fundamental differentiation from competing platforms. Bitcoin laser focuses on something that is *definitely* valuable, and optimizes around it, allowing experiments and innovation to happen at the edges (upper layers and external applications). In contrast, Ethereum tries to experiment on the bottom layer and opts for the strategy of "don't focus on doing anything particularly well, just try to provide a broad (and easy-to-use) enough mechanism that *something* worthwhile might be built with it, and answer the (still unanswered) question of: *what value does the platform actually provide?*" It could very well work out, and something be built on Ethereum that isn't trivially portable to the inarguably more immutable, more decentralized network of Bitcoin... but so far nothing of the sort has manifested.
Bitcoin has a grassroots, no-nonsense community that doesn't spend most of its energy trying to market, while other coins (Ethereum most definitely included) have central marketing agencies that focus on promising-the-whole-shebang and leaving the retail public dazzled and eager to buy. It's an effective strategy while the world wrestles with grokking the insight of what Bitcoin (and blockchains) is and represents, but it might not pan out so well as the market matures and society gradually learns what makes sense and what doesn't in this new, exciting, complex frontier.

No, they wouldn't. 
It constantly surprises me how incredibly backward some of you have it.
The block limit is still in place because *there is currently no reason for it not to be*. 
When that changes (e.g. if millions of Blizzard gamers suddenly start using Bitcoin), then we suddenly have a compelling case for raising the block limit, even if it's just a quick and dirty kick-the-can fix like a one-time bump to 8MB or 20MB.
You have to be incredibly short-sighted and naive to think that the 1MB cap would stay in place as Bitcoin usage explodes significantly.

Try reading what I have written, and maybe asking questions, rather than continuing to make mistaken assumptions.


Plenty of them, and **no**, most crypto development with smart contracts is done on **Bitcoin**, as I've been repeatedly telling you. Please stop spreading misinformation and weaponizing your ignorance like this.


And Bitcoin had it for years before Ethereum even existed, *as I've repeatedly explained to you in this thread*.


You're still missing the primary point and insight that I'm trying to convey, which is that *the bottom layer of an open-access decentralized consensus-based ledger is fundamentally expensive*, and trying to shoehorn in arbitrarily-complex statefulness onto this layer of the stack is economically irrational, likely unsustainable, and without meaningful benefits.
Rootstock represents an interesting proof of concept to demonstrate that "rich statefulness" can be achieved without compromising the underlying foundations, but it *doesn't* represent a significant leap forward from Bitcoin itself, which was **very deliberately** designed such that complex state changes don't take place in the base architecture/consensus layer. Incidentally, Rootstock already does exist and can run any contracts compiled for the EVM, but as I've been pointing out (repeatedly), this isn't really functionality that holds a candle to Bitcoin's native value-proposition (whether the functionality is in an altcoin like Ethereum or a sidechain like Rootstock).
I recommend scrolling up and re-reading everything that I've written in my comments in this thread, this time carefully, and I recommend trying your hardest to figure out what each sentence *is* and *is not* saying.

It's gas-bounded, meaning that infinite computations (like infinite loops) aren't possible. In practice, it actually takes surprisingly little to run into troublesome gas bounds on it; almost any time you're writing a loop in Solidity (and certainly any time where the number of elements isn't predetermined and strictly limited) you're making a mistake, because transactions have to fit inside of a block and there isn't really all that much space to work with. That's one reason why so many contracts require strange and slightly-counterintuitive withdrawal patterns and actor interactivity.
As I mentioned earlier, though, not being Turing-complete is a good thing. If it *was* truly Turing-complete, the Halting problem would rear its ugly head as soon as a clever troll decided to craft a malicious function, and the whole blockchain would grind to a halt as miners chased the fairy over the edge of the cliff.

That is totally false.
SegWit allows transactions to be serialized in a new way, such that the witness data (signatures) can be selectively pruned if it needs to be relayed to an older node. Signatures are **not** separated into "a different data structure" at all, that is misinformation parroted by anti-Bitcoin zealots.
See [these images]( to get a better idea of how SegWit transactions are serialized. It should clear everything up for you, hopefully.

I was thinking the opposite; the graphs each show impressive growth. In Europe, the transaction count is growing by the **tens of thousands**, *every quarter*! Latin American transaction counts (i.e. a remittance-heavy market, or "one of the most obvious markets where relatively-early Bitcoin adoption makes sense") are starting to skyrocket.
If I were you, I would have instead said something about how transaction counts are vanity metrics, and easy (even trivial) to game. I probably would have also reminded everyone about how BitPay is known to release statistics extremely selectively, blatantly omitting the stats that don't show amazing growth, and framing the stats that they *do* release with a healthy helping of bias. You know, the standard stuff. At least then you would have had arguments at least *loosely* grounded in reality.

Try to sync a full node before you say "has no issue". Even the light clients are starting to barf; Parity's warp-mode doesn't even really work any more unless you allocate half a terabyte to it and are willing to dedicate multiple cores at 100% usage for a day or so.
Syncing the official Ethereum wallet on a modern broadband connection and a high-end machine dedicating double digit gigs of RAM to it takes multiple weeks at this point (and it's getting noticeably worse every month).
You won't notice these things if you use trusty solutions like MEW, but "has no issues" is a severe misrepresentation of the situation.

That was the only central planning that has ever gone on regarding the per-block capacity limit of Bitcoin, though.


That is true. He also quite deliberately implemented it as a consensus rule (rather than a policy rule, like the minrelayfee), and knew full well the implications this would have (even later discussing how Bitcoin users might become "increasingly tyrannical" about maintaining a sustainable limit and using this as an argument to keep unrelated data e.g. Namecoin or Ethereum-esque data from being shoehorned into Bitcoin).


You are referring to the time when he strongly and emphatically opposed suggestions to "patch out" the limit without near-universal ecosystem consensus to do so? In the incident you're deliberately trying to misrepresent, Satoshi was telling users **not** to run a blocksize-increasing-patch. The pseudocode was conveying the ability to *pre-schedule* a limit modification *well in advance* once it was agreed that doing so was "needed" (which is an agreement that hasn't yet come to pass, or even come close to doing so). The disingenuous misrepresentation of this quote is as tired as it is malicious.


Satoshi specifically said that the minrelayfee (introduced *after* the blocksize limit was in place) was a "first attempt at limiting spam". Your false narrative doesn't even withstand cursory scrutiny.

The emphasis on the word "cash" in the Bitcoin whitepaper's subtitle is parroted by people who are not well-versed in cryptography and/or want to make it seem like Satoshi would somehow disapprove of Bitcoin being saved or treated as an investment. On the contrary, Satoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining **in the Bitcoin whitepaper**:

While it's true that Satoshi implemented a block-capacity ceiling as a consensus rule as a "centrally planned" parameter and you could make an argument that it was "arbitrary", both of these descriptions apply equally well to *every other rule or setting in Bitcoin*, including the finite supply and issuance schedule. Yes, Satoshi designed Bitcoin centrally in the beginning, and yes, a lot of his decisions could be called "arbitrary" if you really want to do so, though every one has seemed justifiable and (extremely) logically defensible as we have learned and Bitcoin has matured. The "economics of the system" were designed and coded a decade ago to gradually transition to a fee-based paradigm (otherwise the finite supply couldn't be sustainably assured), and while it's true that this has implications in terms of making Bitcoin particularly attractive as a store-of-value, especially in the early stages of its adoption, this doesn't actually discourage its use as a medium-of-exchange (in fact, the opposite is quite true); the disinflationary issuance might indeed discourage expenditure, but that's a function of *increased* demand for the asset... an unambiguous positive from the perspective of Bitcoin investors and users.

It's not a separate blockchain, it's more of a caching system for the blockchain. It's achieved via a jointly-controlled account (which is on the blockchain) which requires multisignature authorizations to update the account balance. You can trade cryptographic signatures (off-chain, without waiting for block confirmations) to authorize different balance updates, created in such a way that only the most recent signature/balance is reasonably claimable.


Because they would have the cryptographic security of the signatures in question, allowing them to "finalize" or "settle" the Lightning Network channel at will by publishing the authorization to the blockchain directly. Granted, the transaction *isn't* as secure as an already-confirmed transaction on the blockchain. You would have a cryptographic guarantee of being able to *create* such a transaction at any time, though.
So for small-value transactions that don't need elite-level security in the moment (or which need to happen in a shorter timeframe than ten minutes) updating your Lightning Channels would make sense, because they would have extremely low fees and would amount to instant transfers. Every so often, you'd likely want to "settle" your channel balance (and pay the relatively-large fee associated with doing so) to make sure everything is rock-solid secure.
The easiest way to think about it is as a checking account that complements your on-chain "savings account". It would be optional, of course (anyone who doesn't want to bother with payment channels and Lightning Networks could just ignore them), but if you want to have ultra-high security for each transaction you make, you're going to have to pay a competitive fee to receive that. And you're competing with *everyone* else who wants to use Bitcoin, so don't be surprised if that's more than a penny or two.
In my opinion, the widespread availability and usage of caching/channel technology (and other layer-two tech) will free up considerable block space on the lowest layer (the blockchain itself). This, in turn, will reduce average on-chain fees, but they would still always likely be appreciably higher than the average fees paid on higher layers like the Lightning Network.
Layer-based networks are highly flexible designs, allowing lots of benefits with very few drawbacks (other than the significant engineering effort it takes to build such things).

[I explained this in more depth a short while ago]( I am happy to hear out any long-term plans that people have in mind regarding when the transition to a fee-centric paradigm should begin, at what rate the transition should occur, and any formal academic analysis to support this reasoning. Unfortunately, in my experience they usually invariably lack any other than "Let's just think of the short term for now, and cross the other bridges as they come!" You don't appear to be any exception (and in fact, you've espoused the fallacy that we don't have to worry about it for *100 years*).


This is something [I've done before]( but I'll do it again.
Satoshi said ["Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale."]( 
He said ["Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either."](
He said ["The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices."]( He said this *in support* of these "increasingly tyrannical" Bitcoin users, as you can see.
He *consistently* [rejected and adamantly opposed every attempt to try and hard-fork the 1MB cap upwards]( siding with theymos and *against* Jeff Garzik. He was a vocal advocate of [soft forks to upgrade Bitcoin]( and was  [staunchly opposed]( to [out-of-consensus Bitcoin implementations]( He believed that [any hypothetical hard forks should *only* be performed with long lead times and with extreme precautions taken to ensure that the changes are uncontroversial, **needed**, and safely adopted by the full network before being activated]( preemptively agreeing with almost every modern Bitcoin developer on the issue. 
He spent **over 10%** of the [original whitepaper]( (an entire page worth of text, 2 out of 12 sections) towards the reclamation of disk space and SPV, clearly having spent a lot of time thinking about the scalability tradeoffs that Bitcoin has to make in order to be truly decentralized.
He said ["In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume."]( which tells us that he expected the block reward subsidy to be phased out and replaced with transaction fees (almost entirely) within *20 years*. 
He [described payment channel implementations]( and [explained how they could be used to facilitate high-frequency trading (which would otherwise not be possible with Bitcoin's design)](
He [advocated merge-mined blockchains]( (which sidechains are an evolution of and improvement upon).
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:39


Disagreeing with what, exactly? I provided proof of what I said.


The term "cash" in the Bitcoin whitepaper is actually what is known as a [term of art]( in cryptography. The term originated with [David Chaum's work]( and if you're interested in going straight to the source material, check out [this whitepaper]( and [this page from **1997**]( (over ten years before Bitcoin's whitepaper was published).
The emphasis on the word "cash" in the Bitcoin whitepaper's subtitle is parroted by people who are not well-versed in cryptography and/or want to make it seem like Satoshi would somehow disapprove of Bitcoin being saved or treated as an investment. On the contrary, Satoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining **in the Bitcoin whitepaper**:


This was not the only time [he likened Bitcoin to gold]( either. He clearly thought that Bitcoin should and would be treated as an investment, saying: "It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."
So you are **provably mistaken** about your interpretation of "Satoshi's vision", and I've provided *even more proof* here that Satoshi modeled Bitcoin after gold and likened it to gold on more than one occasion.


Once again, the OP did not say anything of the sort, and the fact that you are digging your heels in here is *another* indication that you're just here to troll and spread misinformation. Consider this a warning; if you have no interest in honest dialogue or sincere discussion, and would rather troll at every available opportunity and use misleading terminology like "BitcoinSegwit", your welcome in this particular forum will expire.

What do you mean by "hates a secure blockchain"? If one miner controls 100% of Bitcoin's hashrate, **no matter how much hashrate and energy expenditure that represents in absolute terms**, that means that Bitcoin is *as insecure as possible*. It would mean that it is centralized (by definition) and that the chain history could be rewritten at will by that miner (even to include double-spends).
Absolute hashrate alone doesn't make for a secure Bitcoin. If you think Bitmain is particularly influential when it comes to supplying hashrate to Bitcoin's blockchain, and if you want Bitcoin to be as secure as possible, then you should want (and fight for) Bitmain's influence to diminish significantly.

Getting hoodwinked by a conman pretending to be Satoshi (and then continuing to defend said conman in the face of continually mounting evidence against his claims and ever more blatant signs that he is a scammer and nothing more than that) is not even *close* to being in the same ballpark as saying "I strongly believe in the efficiency claims of a new ASIC miner manufacturer, so much so that I have ordered miners from them myself."

I just explained why that is incorrect. The value of Bitcoin would *grow* if a massive demand influx like you describe occurs.
You're not describing a loss of utility. You're describing an increased competition over a scarce resource. That would result in value *growth*, not loss.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:24:34


Some might. But I don't really see a strong incentive to do so, especially when it incurs a real cost when this is done.
You're thinking in binary (which is a normal human impulse). Think in terms of a spectrum, with equilibria.
You know how people complain about "high fees"? Those "high fees" serve as an incentive *not* to "settle on chain" too frequently (after all, every time you do, you're going to have to pay a competitive fee, which loses you actual precious fractions-of-bitcoins). So the definition of "need to" will vary, from person to person, but it comes down to: "Is guaranteeing the security of my balance here worth *sacrificing a non-negligible fee* to achieve that?" Of course, sometimes this will be true, sometimes it won't. It's a spectrum.
If you had ten thousand dollars' worth of BTC in your payment-channel account, and had to pay $5 worth of BTC every time you "settle it", you wouldn't do that every few minutes, of course. But you might do it once every few weeks, or once a month, just to make sure the larger balance isn't in any danger.
Resist the temptation to let your mind extrapolate to the extreme edge-case scenarios as if they're going to be day-to-day occurrences. Much more realistically, some people (or stores) will want to settle on chain relatively frequently, and others will be much more okay with leaving their payment channels open for extended lengths of time, with considerable capital dedicated towards their channel accounts. You get to decide what you're okay with, and how you use the technology. Everyone does.

Bitcoin doesn't have any leaders or central controllers.
A bunch of businessmen got together and said "Hey what if we appointed ourselves as the Leaders of Bitcoin? Let's do it!"
The Bitcoin community said, "Haha no thank you." Some of the businessmen (almost half of them by now, actually) said "Oh okay nevermind." A few of them said "Whatever, we don't really care if the Bitcoin community likes it, we're still going to try and take control anyway!"
They are now doing everything they can to try to help their takeover attempt succeed, including outright attacking Bitcoin. Fortunately it looks like they're just setting themselves up to lose a lot of money, reputation, and lawsuits. Bitcoin will continue to Bitcoin.

I don't understand why you are trying to spin such a weirdly hostile narrative out of this. I am sorry that 2 posts of yours were removed, but you're pretending like you're the victim of some malicious censorship campaign when really you posted a shitpost and a duplicate of an already-frontpaged-link.

Oh, right. Almost forgot: you're a known liar.
I remember when you [photoshopped images to make it seem like Core nodes went down when really it was just BU/Classic nodes that did]( I also remember when you [wrote an article to try and make fun of Bitcoin Core's code, and accidentally wound up revealing the fact that you didn't understand *any* of the code you had been breaking]( I remember when you [kept trying to blame Peter Todd for catalyzing attacks against your hilariously vulnerable code, even though you had been told, multiple times, *with accompanying proof*, that the attacks had started before Peter Todd had ever said a thing]( I remember when you [doubted that a fork on your big-blocks testnet even occurred, after you were already provided plenty of trivially-verifiable proof of the fork](
You are not intelligent, and you are not honorable. You lie *all the time*. You come around trying to spread misinformation and trying to deceive newcomers who don't know any better, saying things that don't have *any* basis in reality. Give it up already, you sad little man.

Oh dear heavens, no. Not even close (except if you just mean "in principle, without considering the many orders of magnitude of difference between the two different platforms' capabilities").

Now you're linking to a screenshot of an arbitrary OKCoin buy order that is about five or six orders of magnitude less than the scenario we're trying to analyze (i.e. *not even remotely close to enough to impact things on a global scale*, i.e. *utterly irrelevant to the original thought experiment*), as if it somehow strengthens your point.

The traditional response to this dilemma (for any individual miner) is: stop mining.


To me, this sounds as if you're just claiming "capitalistic competition inevitably devolves into monopolistic abuse" which might be true, but is certainly not a given.
It's certainly possible that an effective cartel could one day form, which has enough clout to overcome the dissenting miners ("scab miners") who are willing to undercut the cartel's fees competitively. If that day ever arrives, I have no doubt that an alternative cryptocurrency will be more than happy to take the crown and throne from Bitcoin.

You don't have to (and actually should not) make up two words.
You should use a robust dictionary list, and 9-10 words, and you should absolutely not choose them manually. Following those rules will provide you with a large amount of entropy and make it essentially impossible to brute force your password.
The math is just factorials, not very hard. But with hundreds of thousands of words in a dictionary, that's going to be
    X*(X-1)*(X-3)*...(X-10)
where X is the total # of words in the dictionary you're using.
The number is huge.
Add to that the fact that an attacker would not necessarily know the generative technique you used, and you're especially golden.

SegWit is an on-chain capacity increase, as well. Of course, as a known liar, you're not acknowledging this.


I literally linked to *proof*. Quit lying.


Yes, of course you do. You created most of them, after all.


I'm well aware that there are issues in old code (which was already multiple major release versions behind by the time you wrote your hilarious article). You were literally looking at *years old*, obsolete code that was pretty much only still in use by "alt clients" that had no actual competent developer support (i.e. Classic and Unlimited).
It is quite rich that you are *still* trying to say "Look at these issues from many years ago!" and trying to link back to 0.12 code when Core is at **0.15.2** by now. The code was *already* obsolete at the time, it hasn't suddenly become more relevant in the years since!


Haha! *Exactly!*
That's why it was *so funny* and *so telling* when you responded to some random week-old Reddit troll who said "there wasn't even a fork" with: "Wait really? Can you give me more info? We should really combat this FUD if you're right!"
**You trusted, even though you had already had the proof verified for you!**
It's also pretty comical that you're refusing to acknowledge this bit. In that one single comment, you showed just how competent you are. You trust baseless claims from random redditors rather than spending two minutes to verify the facts. Then later you lie and try to change the subject rather than acknowledging how very wrong you always turn out to be.


Haha, check again. Every single one of those links in my last comment leads to *the exact same post*. It was already compiled together for me. I didn't have to "maintain an extremely biased list", all I had to do was remember to Google "astounding incompetence" (**which has your legacy as the first result**)!

It's poorly organized in such a way as to be misleading and perhaps even overwhelming. Pointing people to faucet sites and how-to-mine sites to start off is pretty much just steering them wrong right off the bat.
You have a "Bitcoin Experts to Follow" column which is full of people who are *not* Bitcoin "experts" in any meaningful sense. Some of them are *noteworthy names in Bitcoin*, and if you titled that column something like that, it would make a lot more sense... but including Blythe Masters and Roger Ver in a column titled "Bitcoin Experts" is just telling an outright lie. 
If you want this to be helpful to noobs, you should go out of your way to make sure it is not misleading them. They don't know enough to question stuff like the above, so you wind up perpetuating (or even creating) falsehoods that can later come back and have negative consequences (even to the point of these innocent people losing money, e.g. by falling for one of Ver's scams).

It does in fact change it. You are not relying on a third party; you are instead relying on a network.
You can argue (purely on a semantic basis) that the network constitutes a third party, but by that token virtually *anything* qualifies as a third party, rendering the very phrase "third party" completely useless. After all, I can't transact in cash without involving the third party of "spacetime". *Reductio ad absurdum*.

It's okay to be wrong, you know. It's not the end of the world. You don't have to win every argument.

That's directly contradicting yourself. You actually just said "Current users are investing $x, so current users aren't investing!"...
Besides, most everyone here advocates putting a *tiny* percentage of your portfolio towards Bitcoin (a few hundred dollars, for a good chunk of people under the age of 30, i.e. Bitcoin's obvious demographic at this time). Looks like people are being reasonable, and doing exactly that, on the whole.
Remember, folks, don't invest more than you can afford to lose! If that's $10, cool, no reason to be ashamed. Be smart anyway, and ignore the haters, jerks and trolls like @_date: 2015-08-28 18:20:14

I'm not "painting you as an outsider", the simple fact of the matter is that you have no skin in the Bitcoin game, and this is worth acknowledging when we're discussing the current attack that Bitcoin is being subject to.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:19:30
It's even *more* behind VISA and PayPal in TPS. The more centralization you are willing to accept, the more efficient your transfers can be. Other cryptos have accepted the centralization/throughput trade-off, because almost none of them offer any real long-term value proposition to the world anyway, and thus centralizing them doesn't really do them any harm or matter. Bitcoin *does* provide real value to the world, and it does so through being decentralized.
If you're looking for just throughput, here's a pro-tip: prioritize the *most centralized* solutions, because they have *fundamental* technical advantages when it comes to that stuff. Venmo offers cheaper transaction fees than any crypto ever will.

Take the date now, subtract the date when Bitcoin first launched from it. Subtract 6 hours and 20 minutes because of the unintentional hard-fork in 2013 (which the GP comment correctly observed is not actually "downtime" so much as "time wherein the longest PoW chain eventually was reorganized"). Divide by total time Bitcoin has existed, multiply by 100 to get a readable percentage figure. Print result.

@_date: 2019-02-05 03:45:12
People are going to spend and consume regardless of whether the money/currency they use is deflationary or inflationary. People want things like food, houses, cars, clothes, medical attention, alcohol, and Netflix subscriptions, and money is only good for acquiring such things.
The stock market wouldn't be overturned by the availability of deflationary currency. It's possible that some companies and enterprises might fail, sure, but if their business models are so dependent on the devaluation of money that they can't survive the advent of modern sound money then they're obviously not providing much value to society. Besides, plenty of (actually most) businesses fail all the time even with inflationary currency powering the economy.
Finally, there's one last point worth mentioning: even if something like Bitcoin successfully "takes over" and becomes the world's primary/only money, after the initial climb up the adoption curve, **it would only be as deflationary as the economy is productive**. In other words, after market saturation is achieved, Bitcoin's value/price would grow in direct proportion to economic output. If we imagine an extreme hypothetical where everyone stops working and consuming because they just want to get rich off of holding their deflationary money, *that money would stop being pricewise-deflationary as a result*. Of course, more realistically, an equilibrium would be achieved. People would both spend/consume *and* save/earn, according to their individual material desires and [time preferences]( and the currency they use would appreciate in value at the same rate of net economic growth.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:45:42

That is *not* the definition of scalable. Not even close.
I don't understand why people who aren't engineers try to weigh in on engineering issues as if they are. Imagine someone walking up to a mechanic and saying "The sprockets are on the steering belt when the pistons reverse the axles in the windshield." The mechanic would laugh at you, and if you kept trying to "help" with your nonsense suggestions, they would ask you to leave and eventually just kick you out entirely.
That is what you sound like when you don't understand the terminology that you're trying to use. You're not a programmer, you don't even know what "scalable" means, so *why* are you playing pretend?

From my own computer's dictionary:
    $ wc -l /usr/share/dict/words
    99171 /usr/share/dict/words
That means there are **99,171** different words in the dictionary.
If you are using 4 (properly randomly chosen) words from that file, the total number of possible permutations is:
     99171 * 99170 * 99169 * 99168
Which is roughly 9.67 * 10^19 combinations that an attacker would have to set out to cycle through, to brute force your password.
This should be sufficient entropy for most websites and other services that use passwords. For Bitcoin, though, it's recommended to use 12 seed words (as in BIP32), which will make things exponentially worse for an attacker -- practically impossible to brute force.

It's funny that people are *still* trying desperately to categorize Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme. Desperate is as desperate does, I suppose.


No, I wouldn't. Unfortunately for you, the reality in which I have to pay $6 to make a transaction in Bitcoin is absolutely not the reality we live in.
Inflation is completely separate from transaction fees. I know, it's confusing stuff, but if you work hard to keep your thoughts straight, I'm confident you can mentally map this stuff out and understand it. 
First step first, though: quit with the "ponzi" nonsense. It's childish.

Only an idiot would think that this chart title means that the numbers it shows are actually representative of the cost of a Bitcoin transaction.
If more transactions are made (even if they are pointless transactions sent from myself to myself) this figure necessarily decreases.

"Bitcoin has its legacy" has got to be the single most hilariously dismissive summary of what Bitcoin has going for it... Bitcoin is *Internet money*, Bitcoin is *smart money*, Bitcoin is the *golden standard of decentralization* and no other coin or blockchain comes even *close* to being decentralized like Bitcoin is. The massive friction that you see when various parties and groups try to push their preferred "upgrades" onto Bitcoin is a testament to how *actually decentralized* it is, and the fact that other coins are hard forking every other week without batting an eye shows how malleable and mutable their protocols actually are in comparison. The supply schedule of most altcoins (including ETH) could be swapped out for something new at any point, just like their other protocol parameters have been, and if you have strong expectations to the contrary they are demonstrably irrational at this point. Almost no other coin or blockchain offers anything remotely close to "sound money" like Bitcoin does.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has smart contracts. Every single transaction, technically, is a smart contract, because it has Script predicates/encumbrances that must be satisfied in order to spend the UTXOs associated with it. Granted, these smart contracts aren't Turing complete, but then again neither are those in Ethereum. Not that this is a bad thing; the limitations are not only technically necessary, they are *positive* in the context of cryptographic security and the proof thereof. And with Simplicity and the imminent launch of tech like Rootstock, Bitcoin's smart contracting capabilities are expanding as we go.
Finally, Bitcoin can be used for everyday payments, and the development and refinement of additional layers beyond the base one (e.g. Lightning Network, which is now starting to be tested and used on mainnet), the average fees that users will need to pay are likely going to *massively* drop.
Bitcoin has much more than a "legacy" going for it (but make no mistake, it has that, too). Bitcoin is *The* Blockchain, and the fact that people are so willing to pay (relatively high) fees to use it serves as an excellent indicator of this fact.
TL;DR: Don't underestimate Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-23 18:19:15


It feels like you're not really reading what I'm writing. I'm simply describing *Bitcoin*, as it was designed from the outset. Its value is that it gives a *decentralized* e-cash solution, and the implementation by which it does so necessitates competitive transaction fees.
I realize that a "free lunch" would be much nicer, if it were possible. 


Yes, he was.


Actually, you seem to be misunderstanding what you've read. He didn't design it capped at 32MB deliberately, it's just that the way that the network code was implemented meant that any blocks bigger than 32MB would *implicitly* (not *explicitly*) not be able to be sent out over the network. You could mine blocks as big as you wanted, and there were no consensus rules preventing those blocks from being valid... you simply couldn't communicate them to your peers, so you would effectively just orphan your own chain in the process.


Actually, as I've pointed out *many* times before, Satoshi *explicitly* said that the "first attempt at addressing spam" was the introduction of the minrelayfee setting, which was introduced a few months after the blocksize limit was put in place. We know for a fact that the blocksize limit was **not** meant to limit/prevent spam, by Satoshi's own admission. The "blocksize was just meant to prevent spam" line is simply misinformation.
I can spend forever explaining the truths about Bitcoin's design to you, but if you're not going to listen and you're not willing to learn any more, there's very little use in doing so.

Miners trying to game the system is fine (Bitcoin itself relies on this, to a degree), but there are other negative effects of this sort of vulnerability that aren't so fine. For one, the unpredictable hashrate and block intervals meant that sometimes (for dozens of hours at a time, in some cases) these "dynamic difficulty adjustment" chains would see *no blocks whatsoever*, meaning that not a single transaction would be processed during that timeframe.
Imagine needing to make a time-sensitive transaction, but having the misfortune of needing to do so during one of the periods when the hashrate disappeared on one such chain. No matter how high you make your associated transaction fee, no miners mining the chain means that you're out of luck until they come back. It is an outright broken model.
Furthermore, it means that *if* mining were meaningfully decentralized, any subsequent hard forks on such a chain would stand a much better chance of splitting the network in two and fracturing/damaging the ecosystem, because the difficulty of the original (pre-hard-forked) chain can always adjust in response to the lost hashrate and keep the chain "viable" (so to speak). Of course, in a centralized network where all the miners are being operated or controlled by a single (or very few) entities, this problem is not quite so pronounced, though at that point, the network has worse and deeper problems anyway.

I can just as well accuse you of horrible things like human trafficking, and demand that you turn over your financial records of the past ten years. If you truly have nothing to hide, you shouldn't be afraid of turning those financial records over to me, right?
The thing is, these troll armies have done *nothing* but demonstrate malicious intent, scarily consistently, day in and day out. The thread we're discussing even demonstrates this point remarkably well. Just like you aren't going to turn over your financial records to someone across the Internet (because you'd be rightly suspicious of their intent, *whether or not you had anything to hide*), I am not going to just say "Yeah sure here you go!" to the shrieking demands for logs that come from people who have a history of malfeasance and an utter lack of moral integrity. I don't have the authority to do it in the first place, and even if I did, I wouldn't, because I have seen firsthand how you and your cohorts conduct yourselves. And beyond that, I know *full well* that even open-sourcing mod logs wouldn't meaningfully appease anyone who is hell-bent on attacking this subreddit and the Bitcoin community; again, there is a long (and shockingly consistent) history of an utter and comprehensive refusal to acknowledge concessions, compromises, and appeasements as they come. To cite a particularly glaring example, look at SegWit: the blocksize was increased and now rbtc pretends like SegWit is some sort of poisonous cancer and that it somehow *isn't* a blocksize increase at all!
The time for good faith is long past. I have laid out facts, and I can prove each individual fact that I have laid out. I have deconstructed the conspiracy theory and the nebulous accusations therein, systematically identifying the logical fallacies and breakdowns that it employed, and I would be more than happy to discuss any portion of it in more depth with anyone who has *any* meaningful rebuttal or response to offer. Notice that no one is actually trying to do anything of the sort, though. Instead we see sweeping demands of "open all mod logs!" and "I have you tagged as a troll!" responses. If no one is even going to bother acknowledging even a sliver of what I said (and plenty that I said is publicly verifiable, and doesn't require *any* mod-level access to independently confirm) then there is no reason why I should bend over backwards to accommodate the disproportionately-enormous requests of an insane and hostile community that abandoned any pretense of rationality or civility long, long ago. 
If you give me comprehensive financial records for the past decade of you and your family, so that I can confirm firsthand that you haven't been involved in human trafficking (of which you stand accused) I will grant you access to mod logs. Of course, that won't happen (and I don't expect you to do anything of the sort) because I have no right to demand such a thing from you, and you have no duty to turn such a thing over. If you presented a logical breakdown of why something I said was wrong, and precisely pinpointed what was wrong about it and *why* it was wrong, and then I said "Oh yeah well you're human trafficking scum who won't even turn over your records because you're so scared of what I'd find if you did!" then you would have every right to dismiss me and walk away.
I laid out the facts, and no one is even *trying* to acknowledge them and concede that I made a good point (or two, or three, or twenty) along the way. Instead they call me a censor, a troll, a sockpuppet, and worse. I owe you nothing, and you should be ashamed of how you conduct yourself and who you associate with.
If you continue on a crusade to troll, deflect, and mislead, and you have no intention of actually discussing *Bitcoin*, then your welcome in this particular online community may not last much longer.

He likes to make broad, sweeping statements like "Decentralized systems can **never** come to consensus in a matter of seconds or 1 minute" but he has never provided a proof of this "fact" or even come close to doing so. When he speaks in such sloppy absolutes, it makes it much harder to take the rest of what he says seriously.

Actually, this isn't accurate. It would require purchasing 25% of all bitcoins *at the current price*, which would certainly not remain "the current price" for very long if huge buy orders started rolling through.


At a high enough price, pretty much all bitcoins that haven't had their private keys lost are "actively on the market". 
But like I said, it wouldn't take buying 1/4 of the coins in order to buy a billion dollars' worth of bitcoins. As you start to buy, the ask-side of the markets gets thinner and thinner the higher up you go and the more slippage you incur. You would definitely not get a very good "bang for your buck", in other words.

Bitcoin has acted as a "safe haven asset" a few times in the past few years (e.g. during the Cyprus bail-ins of early 2013, and during the Brexit last year). It has seen significant press over the past twelve months describing it as such (which can result in a self fulfilling prophecy).
It is historically uncorrelated with almost all traditional assets; in finance terms, it has very high *alpha* and *beta* values. There have been a number of academic studies and reports that examine these aspects of Bitcoin, which you can find with a quick Google search.
None of this serves as any guarantee, but it certainly serves as a strong indication of how Bitcoin might behave during a global economic crash or recession.

Don't worry. It will, at some point, like it has many times before.
Then, a few months or years later, it will rise again, even more fiercely. This will continue until the market (i.e. world) is saturated, which will be at a price which is at least another order of magnitude (and more likely 2 or even 3) higher than the current levels.

Excellent response. I do think that you're right about a deflationary global currency leading to some degree of aggregate economic contraction, in particular during the era where society is transitioning from an inflationary regime. In other words, I think we seem to pretty much agree on the major points here.
One more interesting note on this subject is that the incentives for a *state* are at direct odds with the incentives of *individuals* when it comes to currency inflation. Clearly, if given a choice in the matter, a rational person would prefer to receive and save money that continually grows in value rather than one that loses value over time (at least if we assume all else is equal). However, since the macroeconomic effect of *everyone* using deflationary money is a net reduction in demand, for the reasons that you've done a great job of explaining, it is reasonable to conclude that this would result in an overall decrease in economic production and output... which, of course, isn't something that a competitive nation state or government wants.
Bitcoin's baked-in adoption-incentives could therefore be seen as a type of Tragedy of the Commons, at least when seen from the perspective of governments and policymakers.

Of course the checkout goes quicker in the empty store.
Also, it turns out that the groceries from Store 2 don't actually have any nutrition, so they eventually leave you hungrier than you started. Nutrition in this analogy is decentralization.

It could go well past such a "theoretical limit", though. 
1) People are greedy and markets like to overshoot. 
2) The supply of Bitcoins has a hard upper cap, but that's no guarantee that the available supply on-market will ever even get *close* to 21M. 
3) The aggregate supply of "value" is increasing (and the rate of increase is accelerating) due to increases in efficiency and productivity, so any "upper bound" calculated now is inevitably obsolete a week from now.
4) Bitcoin can hypothetically replace more than just the value represented by the M1 money supply.
5) Dollars could fall in value between now and the moon.
I could keep going, but hopefully you get the idea. Bitcoins worth more than $10M are totally possible. Don't count on it, but don't rule it out, either.

You're saying "No one eats there any more, it's too crowded" without seeming to realize it.
Bitcoin is perfectly usable. If someone doesn't want to deal with transaction fees, the bad news is that Bitcoin is *built to run on them*. There's a market for the scarce resource that is Bitcoin block space, and there *has* to be, or else the whole system doesn't work and brings no value to the world.
If someone tries to sell a simple solution to an exceptionally complex problem, generally this should be met with extreme skepticism. Doing so in this case will pretty quickly result in a meaningful understanding of the subject, and an appreciation of why "just double the blockweight limit to 'solve fees' whether or not the Bitcoin community and network thinks it's a good idea!" is pretty much the dumbest suggestion that one could make or entertain. 
I'm not calling you dumb (you don't seem to be, and you seem to understand all of what I'm saying above). I'm just not too worried about fee rates, because they're still perfectly reasonable, *and we are actively pursuing real solutions towards reducing them massively*, namely, building out more layers in the Bitcoin stack. Not everything belongs at the base layer (in fact, *as little as possible* should go there).

Heh, I wish I could answer that question confidently. I've been saying for years now that we could count on a $10,000 Bitcoin, but that was as far as my crystal ball ever allowed me to see. Now that we're finally here (or just about), I ask myself: "How much higher will it go?" and I realize that I have no idea any more.

The precious blockchain ledger should only be used when making transactions that need the value it provides (through its all-important decentralization) enough to cover the marginal costs associated with the transaction(s) in question.
In other words, if your transaction costs the world at large more than it benefits you, then there should be a disincentive to making it. Otherwise Bitcoin is objectively outright unsustainable, and will inevitably collapse.
You can strawman this argument into "only debt settlement transactions between countries" if you want to, but that says more about you than it does about the technology.

This is true. And it would be terrible for sending $1B because sufficient liquidity is not there for an elegant entry (or exit, assuming the interested party wanted to convert back to fiat) at this time. It's not necessarily true that "no one would buy 1 billion dollars of Bitcoin", though it's a reasonable opinion to have.
Just as a fun mental exercise (not necessarily for you, but for anyone interested), though, consider the possibility that a wealthy someone (e.g. Richard Branson) *would* decide to buy $1B of Bitcoin. Why might they do that, especially when factoring in slippage costs? I can think of at least one reason: start a massive pump.
The pump would be massive on a scale we haven't yet even approached. To say that it would start a new Bitcoin Bubble is the biggest understatement you could make. It would spur a Superbubble.
And sure, depending on how things played out from there, they might eventually dump (typically that's the market play that follows a pump, after all). But even allowing this contingency, there is much to consider... if the Superbubble was particularly effective, it could conceivably destabilize other fiat monies and begin the Hyperbitcoinization process, which would serve as an incentive *not* to dump as Bitcoin ascends.
Of course, I expect you to downvote me, ridicule me, and link this comment to so they can do the same. But thought experiments are entertaining, and it's interesting to consider that one bored billionaire could change the world so dramatically... if, of course, they had the inclination to do so.

That's exactly what it is. Hundreds of thousands (perhaps even millions or *tens* of millions) of new users have gotten involved with Bitcoin since August 1, and these users aren't able to buy BCH without incurring the opportunity cost of buying BTC instead.

I know that the current BCH/BTC ratio is *lower* than when it first started trading, according to CoinMarketCap. I know that it is *lower* than the average rate it enjoyed during the August 1-7 pump. I know that this pretty soundly adds to the embarrassment you *should* be feeling right about now.

You're thinking in binary (which is a normal human impulse). Think in terms of a spectrum, with equilibria.
You know how people complain about "high fees"? Those "high fees" serve as an incentive *not* to "settle on chain" too frequently (after all, every time you do, you're going to have to pay a competitive fee, which loses you actual precious fractions-of-bitcoins). So the definition of "need to" will vary, from person to person, but it comes down to: "Is guaranteeing the security of my balance here worth *sacrificing a non-negligible fee* to achieve that?" Of course, sometimes this will be true, sometimes it won't. It's a spectrum.
If you had ten thousand dollars' worth of BTC in your payment-channel account, and had to pay $5 worth of BTC every time you "settle it", you wouldn't do that every few minutes, of course. But you might do it once every few weeks, or once a month, just to make sure the larger balance isn't in any danger.
Resist the temptation to let your mind extrapolate to the extreme edge-case scenarios as if they're going to be day-to-day occurrences. Much more realistically, some people will want to settle on chain relatively frequently, and others will be much more okay with leaving their payment channels open for extended lengths of time, with considerable capital dedicated towards their channel accounts. You get to decide what you're okay with, and how you use the technology. Everyone does.

Yes. All transactions on Bitcoin do, in fact.


Your understanding is incorrect. The witness data is broadcast in the block itself, the transactions in SegWit are simply [serialized such that the witness data is easily strippable if needed]( I highly recommend looking over those images to enrich your understanding of how SegWit works; the whole "witness data is broadcast separately from the block itself" meme has survived for far longer than any misinformation ever should.
SegWit is essentially a transaction version upgrade (again, see the images above to understand it better). That is precisely what Satoshi was talking about in the link.


That's exactly what he's doing. In fact, reading it literally, he seems to be saying that Bitcoin definitionally **cannot** hard fork, at all. However, that is an oversimplification in my opinion, and if Satoshi *did* truly believe that when he wrote that comment, I believe he was mistaken. His later suggestion that we could "phase in" a blocksize increase may indicate that his thinking on the subject eventually evolved.


Yes, he is. He is also talking about how Bitcoin itself cannot change its fundamental properties via hard forking (because, as you say, that represents the launch of a *new* and *incompatible* network), and he is also talking about Script and its predicates, and how much trouble he went through to make sure that upgrades to Bitcoin could be soft-forked in without disrupting the network. He talks about a lot of things in that message.


Right, it broke **away** from Satoshi's vision, and spun off into a new coin entirely, which is definitionally *not* Bitcoin. I am glad that you see and understand this.


We know that it was *not* an "anti-spam" measure because months later Satoshi described the minrelayfee as the "first attempt at limiting spam on the network"... and though we do not have explicit quotes from Satoshi regarding his exact reasoning for putting the limit in place, I do believe that it was intended as an anti-DoS measure (among other things). Again, Satoshi spent a *lot* of time talking about (and fighting for) the size of the blockchain to be as small as possible for as long as possible, so this consensus rule was almost certainly *also* intended to help with that.
Personally, I've spent a lot of time thinking it over, and I wouldn't be surprised if the blocksize consensus rule was put in place as a Trojan Horse (of sorts) meant to "teach a lesson in decentralized governance". I haven't reached a firm verdict on this yet, myself, but as far as fan theories go, it seems plausible enough.


I wish. If I did, I'd trot that quote out at every opportunity.


Full blocks may be [**necessary** for Bitcoin to survive in the long-term]( This not only means that full blocks are *not a bad thing*, but that they are a symptom of a healthy Bitcoin network. 
There's obviously no true objective answer to your question, but I would say "if and when the blocksize starts to cause actual issues for Bitcoin and its userbase, an increase is warranted"... of course, my opinion only matters so much, because I only have so much say in a decentralized network with no leaders.
It's also important to note that individual users being discontent with the competitive fee-rates for fast transaction confirmation is not necessarily a fundamental issue with Bitcoin. Everyone wants a free ride and a free lunch, but we live in reality, and reality is a little harsher than that.
Finally, it's important to note that the blocksize was just *more than doubled*, from a strict 1MB to a much higher 4M WU. Since relatively few transactions have been trying to take advantage of the increased capacity, it indicates that apparently the blocksize was not the massive point-of-pain that it has been being painted as by certain entities. By and large, Bitcoin users don't seem to be in a huge rush to be reducing their average fees paid. It just doesn't seem to be as much of a priority as the spinsters seem to want us to think.




No, I am not arguing that we should reduce transaction capacity at all. I understand those that *do* argue that (though note that very few do). I am happy that we just more-than-doubled the transaction capacity of the network via a soft-fork upgrade, and that significantly lower fee-rates are available for those who consider this a priority.


No. It wouldn't hurt, but "necessary" is a massive overstatement.


Yes. And (at risk of repeating myself here) I am very glad that we just significantly did so with SegWit.


I'm not sure. I certainly would hope and expect that they would be correlated, but I recognize that empirical evidence doesn't indicate that this is necessarily true.
Honestly, it's tough to tell the truth of the matter on this one. I'm all ears if you have good arguments (or even better, *evidence*) on the subject.


Right. And I'm hopeful that this would hold true. But I'm not even particularly convinced that node-count is a "the higher the better" type metric. The [CONOP]( does seem like something that we'd want to minimize, if you ask me, but it's a thorny subject all-around.


Well, I think we've both already established that Satoshi would not consider BCH Bitcoin *even if that did occur*, but I hear your point. The problem is that most BCH proponents are very much trying to have their cake and eat it, too. As you say: if you feel that hashrate defines Bitcoin (and have argued to that effect) and you say that BCH *is* Bitcoin, you're contradicting yourself. In my (rather extensive) experience, that is *exactly* what most of rbtc's inhabitants have been doing. It is rather embarrassing.

First, I *just* spent some time writing up a comment that describes a few of the (many) things wrong with BCH, which you can read [here]( In that comment, I linked to a quote from Satoshi where he talks about how much effort he went through when designing Bitcoin to make sure it could be upgraded via soft-forks, and in the link, it's almost uncanny how well his description of potential future upgrades he envisioned matches how SegWit was implemented (he even talks about how transaction version upgrades -- like SegWit -- can be ignored by older nodes that don't understand them yet, without problems).
In that very same link, Satoshi talks about how Bitcoin's core design was "set in stone" from the very beginning, essentially doing his utmost to discourage what are now known as "hard forks" a la BCH. It is worth reading the full comment directly, in my opinion.
In fact, over the years, Satoshi spent a *lot* of time and effort to discourage alternative forks of Bitcoin, and would say things like "I don't think a separate implementation will *ever* be a good idea" (because he considered network consensus so sacrosanct). BCH proponents consistently ignore inconvenient truths like this.
It's important to remember that Satoshi was the one who put the blocksize limit consensus rule in place in the first place, and in *every* instance where someone tried to raise it, he chimed in to say that he disagreed and that it should only be raised if the network truly needed it (and only with a long lead time and with extensive precautions taken to notify all users of the change). He was actually surprisingly fanatical about keeping blocks (and the blockchain in general) as small as possible, and if you go digging through his writings, you'll see tons of cases where he was adamantly opposing blockchain bloat and championing keeping Bitcoin as lightweight as we possibly can.
In fact, when BitDNS was first proposed (which eventually evolved into Namecoin), people started discussing the possibility of merging this functionality directly into Bitcoin. They even proposed a generalized state machine (just like Ethereum) and many were of the opinion that this, too, should be added to Bitcoin. Satoshi weighed in to say that he was strongly opposed to doing this, because (in his words): "piling every proof of work quorum into a single dataset doesn't scale" and he went on to say that over time, Bitcoin users might (and apparently in his opinion *should*) become "increasingly tyrannical" about limiting the size of Bitcoin's chain so as to keep it lightweight and thus available (and affordable) for as many users as possible to join in and participate on the network.
Satoshi thought that lite client (SPV) security would be a good way to allow users to get most of the benefits of Bitcoin without running a full node themselves, but he said that this would make sense when the network got to be "very large", and the exact figure he mentioned for such a scenario was *100,000 nodes* (which we're sadly woefully short of at the moment). This is why some people (like Luke-Jr) argue that the current blocksize limit is *already* too high; the network node count is very much on the low side, right now, and it seems like Satoshi would probably agree with his take on the subject.
Beyond mere blocksizes, there are other aspects of BCH that would almost certainly invoke the wrath of Satoshi. For one, the cumulative chain difficulty is *massively* lower than that of the real Bitcoin network, and even though most of the proponents of BCH spent incredible amounts of effort arguing that "hashrate defines Bitcoin" (which, in my opinion, is total bunk), by this criteria BCH is as far as you can get from Bitcoin and it should have died long ago. Of course, they don't like to acknowledge this nowadays.
The only reason why their chain didn't outright *disappear* from the lack of hashrate is because they made *yet another massive deviation from Satoshi's vision to preserve it*: they added in the EDA. This resulted in erratic, unpredictable block times (and regular periods of the network grinding to a complete halt for many hours at a time, followed by a sudden spurt of hashrate where *hundreds of blocks* were found per hour, almost all of them empty and processing no transactions whatsoever, but still granting full mining rewards to the miners who were taking advantage of the opportunity). As a result, BCH not only exhibited wild deviation from the targeted "ten minute average block time" that Satoshi described so often, but it *also* exhibited brief periods of hyperinflation, violating *yet another* defining property of Bitcoin that Satoshi considered very important (the predictable and regular supply schedule).
Finally, mining of BCH is incredibly centralized; it seems that almost all (if not all) mining pools that mine it are subsidiaries of Bitmain. This renders Bitmain the de facto central rulers of BCH, soundly defeating the entire purpose and undermining the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin.
I could keep going, but I'm writing this on my phone and my hands are tired. In short, BCH is *not* Satoshi's vision, and if you spend any serious amount of time reading what he wrote and what his priorities were, this becomes abundantly clear.

I was not being sarcastic at all. It is hilarious that you say "The raison d'etre of a platform should only be a consideration once some mythical (and arguably unsatisfiable) criteria has been achieved."
It will be difficult to explain why this is funny if you aren't able to see it immediately, but I suppose I can try via analogy. Imagine that someone tries to sell you a magic telescope that allowed you to see forward in time (into the future). Sounds like a really useful tool! So you buy the telescope, and when you put it up to your eye, you just see blackness. The seller explains: "Oh the telescope only shows you the future once the future-lens technology is fully matured."
Do you see why *that* would be funny?

One of the biggest differences between Bitcoin and other wealth is how Bitcoin, when properly understood and handled, is almost impossible to confiscate or control by anyone other than the owner.

BCH is **not** Bitcoin, it is an altcoin that basically automatically granted holders of Bitcoin free balances of BCH when it launched. This is known as an "airdrop" and it is actually an increasingly common tactic to bootstrap new altcoins (coins like CLAMS, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond have all done the same thing, but *none* of these coins are Bitcoin proper).
The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed it so that it could be upgraded via "soft forks". He specifically said that [he worked very hard to make sure transaction version upgrades could be soft forked](  and one example of such a soft fork (a transaction upgrade and blocksize increase) was *SegWit*, which was activated on the Bitcoin network on August 1. The biggest benefit of soft forks is that since they make sure all the old rules of the network are valid, everyone stays on the same chain and the Bitcoin network remains unified. *This* is the type of upgrade that Satoshi most strongly advocated, which means that Bitcoin (the *real* Bitcoin, BTC) is the network closest to what the inventor tried to reach. It is also worth about $10,000 per coin right now (more than 6x as much as BCH), has about 50x more transaction volume, and has *way* more miner/hashpower support, so that should tell you something about the market's assessment on the matter.
The BCH supporters will often try to say that their coin is "the real Bitcoin" and that they are "following Satoshi's vision" but technically speaking, both of these statements are lies and intended to mislead newcomers like you. BCH is an altcoin which made a bunch of buggy changes to the original Bitcoin source code, and actually wound up breaking some key aspects of Bitcoin (their coin would often grind to a halt, and zero transactions would be processed for about a dozen hours as all the miners abandoned the coin, and then suddenly they would flood back and find hundreds of empty blocks per hour, which is not only ridiculous but very much against how Satoshi described and designed Bitcoin to work).
Furthermore, BCH doesn't offer a single benefit over most altcoins (some of which have just-as-cheap transaction fees, higher transaction volumes, and shorter block times which means quicker confirmations). Many altcoins have much more competent developers supporting and building them, too. This is the reason why BCH proponents get so upset when their coin is referred to as "Bcash"... they don't actually have *anything* going for them other than the ridiculous attempt to piggyback on the Bitcoin brand name, so when "Bitcoin" is not included in their name, they are left with *absolutely nothing*.
Finally, the raison d'être for BCH is to preserve covert ASICBOOST, which is a vulnerability that is apparently being exploited by the Bitmain mining oligarchy (which creates perverse mining incentives that hurt users of the network for no benefits other than lining certain miners' pockets) and which the SegWit upgrade prevents. When the whole reason a coin exists is so that a select group of miners can profit at the expense of users, it should really hammer home how ugly the whole thing is.

The post we're in isn't mocking Satoshi's vision at all, it's mocking Roger Ver (who is technically illiterate).
I just explained why BCH has nothing to do with Satoshi's vision, and how it cannot reasonably be considered something that Satoshi would endorse.
There is no such thing as "Bitcoin SegWit" and honestly you come across as a troll when you pretend like that's a thing. There is **Bitcoin**, which now has SegWit activated on it, but the name is just "Bitcoin" and the ticker remains "BTC" as it has always been. Nothing about the activation of SegWit is contrary to "Satoshi's vision" and I even included a link (**in the very comment you replied to**) wherein Satoshi *clearly* explains how upgrades like SegWit are what he had in mind when it comes to advancing and improving the Bitcoin protocol. Seriously, click and read the link, it's absolutely *uncanny* how well SegWit fits the description that Satoshi gave all those years ago. Specifically this excerpt:

This is so far removed from my point, that I'm not sure if you completely missed the point or if you're deliberately ignoring it.
I'm not saying that Bitcoin will displace the dollar. Not in NASDAQ, not in general.
I'll try to boil the point down to its core essence, so that you'd have to go out of your way to misinterpret it...
The 1MB cap in Bitcoin, which will eventually be raised with a hard-fork, is not a critical concern for organizations such as NASDAQ who are piloting a share-trading platform on the Bitcoin blockchain. The nitty-gritty specifics of how this hard-fork takes place **do not significantly matter** from their perspective.
Initially, your rebuttal to this point was "But *any* uncertainty is doom from a financial firm's perspective! You must be stupid not to realize that!" And my response was merely to point out that there is no such thing as absolute-certainty, even if you're using something as established as the dollar. This unfortunately *whoosh*ed over your head...

Sidechains won't cut out miners' power...
Miners don't have much power to begin with. They can select and order transactions within the confines of the Bitcoin consensus protocol, and receive a set amount of coins as a reward when they do. That's it.
Sidechains don't work like how you think they work, either. People using a sidechain wouldn't "lower miners' revenue" and I really don't understand how you got that impression to begin with. If anything, using sidechains would *increase* miner revenue by making bitcoins themselves (the asset which backs the sidechain) more valuable.
You're right that sidechains have awesome potential, but you seem to be pretty severely confused about what they actually are and do.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:04:14
I am not sure if you confused who said what, but your paraphrasing of my argument (if that is indeed what it is supposed to be) is pretty much the exact opposite of what I said. 
With that said, I can appreciate the argument that "government involvement in Bitcoin is more likely to do harm than good" in a general sense. One fact that you don't seem to appreciate is that government involvement is not only inevitable, *it is already occurring* and there is nothing you or I can do about it, no matter how much it might bother us.
This might be a good time to re-read my previous comment (you may notice I mentioned that Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum, and hopefully it's a little clearer to you by this point what that means).
Government involvement in Bitcoin isn't ideal, and I've never seen anyone other than Jorge Stolfi argue that it is. But what you (and PaydShill) seem to be missing is that it's a reality, *and it cuts both ways*. Yes, people can (and will) run to the government to protect their interests (whatever those might be). There's nothing you can do about it; society exists and nation states are a part of it. That is the way things are, like it or not.
The good news is that "the bad guys" (and by that I mean enemies of Bitcoin's growth and progress) do not have some special monopoly on government intervention. If governments exist, and can be called upon, and *are* called upon every day, then there is nothing stopping *friends* of Bitcoin from calling upon them, too.
And the big *eureka* that I'm trying to give you guys is that *Bitcoin specifically motivates this sort of behavior*. Once someone has invested (time, money, reputation, *any* type of capital) into the Bitcoin network, they are incentivized to protect and fight for the that investment's best interests. **This is the core driver of Bitcoin's growth.** What that support looks like will vary wildly in each individual case (some people are engineers, others are marketers, others are lawyers) but the bottom line is that they will fight for their "team" when it comes down to it, even if their chosen method of "fighting" isn't one that you personally vibe with.
*That* is why Bitcoin is antifragile. Through cryptography, it arranges incentives such that participants' interests are aligned with those of the network as a whole. Thus, the humans who make up the network become a (highly adaptive) asset that can respond or retaliate to attacks as appropriate.
It's beautiful, once you see it.

Again, you have a valid point, but the fact that mining itself is a permissionless and competitive industry (anyone can mine), means that valid and market-competitive transactions submitted to the network will, for all intents and purposes, confirm in a reasonable frame of time. You could hypothetically go buy some ASICs yourself and confirm your own transactions if need be.
Of course, you'd need "permission" to buy an ASIC from a willing manufacturer or reseller... but at that point you're stretching the term so thin that it's essentially useless, wouldn't you agree?

To answer your question: no. You are able to use the Lightning Network without running a node at all.

"Hodl" doesn't mean "keep any old shitcoin forever", it means "resist the temptation to sell your Bitcoin out of fear".
Many of us converted our BCH to BTC because we believe in Bitcoin's future, but not in Bcash's. It is a rational trade to make. Heck, I know I did (at a better ratio than what we see today, in fact, so if I wanted to, I could buy back all my original BCH and then some). It was not an impulsive or emotional decision at all.
You don't appear to be an active trader (or even community member), and your comments here seem to indicate you don't have a very robust understanding of Bitcoin. For those that don't understand what makes Bitcoin valuable, and what has driven its growth, I can see why they would be confused by the actions of the people who do.

It'd make the most sense (and be trivial to do) to sign with the key of an early block. If I'm not mistaken, he could use the key of the Genesis Block to sign with; even though the coins are unspendable, the signature should still work.
It would be easy for him to do, and it would be basically indisputable proof of identity. 
Without such a signature, we should by default assume that it is not Satoshi. Always.

"Other Bitcoin" is a contradiction in terms.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:35:30
Oh, dear.
1) There are ~99 actual bitcoins "known to be Satoshi's" and 50 of them are unspendable. We can guess (and we would almost certainly be correct if we did) that a whole lot more coins are controlled by Satoshi (most of the earliest-mined coinbases), but we do not even come *close* to "knowing" which coins are Satoshi's and which are not, *even* for those earliest blocks. "Know" is simply too strong a word, period.
2) [As I've said before]( though some nonce-based analysis concluded that roughly 1 million of the earliest mined coins were mined by a single entity (assumed to be Satoshi), this analysis was based on a string of questionable assumptions and is not really something you want to be basing statements like "we know X" upon.
3) (and this was my crucial point, which unfortunately appears to have escaped you): *even* assuming the aforementioned analysis *did* arrive at a correct conclusion, *it only establishes a lower bound, at best*. Satoshi could have been mining plenty of blocks and coins that *aren't* identifiable in any way whatsoever, and in fact, it is almost a certainty that he/she/they/it did. All you would have to do if you were Satoshi is spend the coins that you mined most recently (in 2011 or 2012, most likely) first, rather than doing something insane like spending the coins from blocks  and you would be lost in the crowd of early adopters and slip under the radar with ease.
Satoshi was (and probably still is) a master of retaining anonymity, against all odds. If your argument is "Oh we'll be able to detect whenever he spends any coins that he controls" then your argument is bad and you should be embarrassed for having made it.

@_date: 2015-08-17 23:43:36
I looked into it, to be sure. It appears that I was right; the unspendability of the Genesis Block isn't due to the lack of a private key associated with it, it is due to the coinbase transaction of the block being excluded from the global transaction database, rendering any movement of these coins apparently invalid to nodes (so they will reject any transaction spending them).
The associated private key should still therefore be usable for signatures, assuming Satoshi possesses it.

Beyond that, the airdrop approach represents yet another way to game the "market cap" metric, which is (ridiculously enough) naively taken seriously as a measure of a cryptocurrency's success. It's a particularly effective means of doing so, too, at least partially because of the reluctance-to-sell you've mentioned.
There's more to it than just psychological reluctance, too. You have to have custody of your private keys in order to claim your airdropped tokens (or the service which does have custody must credit you the balance thereof). As we've seen with Coinbase, this can take many months, and other exchanges/services have gone so far as to say that they won't recognize future airdrops (or that they'll simply sell them off as they come, and credit their users a proportional amount of Bitcoin from the proceeds). There is friction to do with awareness (you aren't going to be able to sell coins that you don't know you have), and even more friction to do with jumping through the technical hoops required to safely claim such tokens. Doing so is usually not trivial by any means; even for users who are relatively technically savvy, many have squirreled their BTC away into deliberately-hard-to-access cold storage, and in some cases it compromises the "coldness" of that storage to access or use the private keys in any way. Since not every Bitcoin-supporting exchange allows the trading or selling of airdropped tokens, there can also be friction with regards to finding, registering, and depositing into one that does.
All of the above types of friction serve to reinforce the phenomenon that you're talking about, too. If I know that these airdropped tokens are somewhat tricky to sell, and I know that most "users" or "holders" of them won't be capable of going through the motions necessary to do so, it means that downward price pressure is somewhat mitigated (at least in the short term and until user-friendly solutions and guides emerge). That, in turn, means that I don't have to worry about "rushing to sell before the price drops to zero", which might otherwise encourage me to dump as soon as possible.
It's a strange new world, that's for sure.

@_date: 2015-07-25 01:09:02
The same principles still apply, though. At higher prices, total market liquidity, and thus necessarily utility, are both higher.
Bitcoin works fine at $1 per coin, but it works *better* at $2, for many reasons. The same logic holds for $99 vs $100 and $250 vs $1200. Really, the higher the price per coin, the better (more useful) Bitcoin is to anybody.

Good point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:48:52


It's not "my" definition. This is a term of art in cryptography, as I said. If you spent time on cryptographic mailing lists (like where Bitcoin was announced) you would know that this is a frequently used term and how it is used. It is not my fault that you haven't spent time looking into these things, but it is shameful of you to dismiss those of us who *do* hang out in such channels when we tell you something you didn't previously know.


Because Bitcoin *does* have the power to lower transaction costs dramatically. I don't think anyone who knows what they're talking about would try to argue differently.
One reason the engineers in the space are so excited about tech like the Lightning Network is that it would allow us to really tap into this power, and let people send each other micropayments without undermining Bitcoin's value proposition in the process.
Satoshi said: 


Notice how he said "currently", implying that one day, as we flesh out the tech and build out solutions, it *will* be practical for such things.
Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither was Bitcoin. That's why it is so frustrating to see people who have *no* engineering background getting mad at those who are paving the way forward and *actually building solutions to improve Bitcoin*. If you aren't writing the code yourself, you have no right to be trying to weigh in on the discussions about what the code should look like, and doing so makes you look and sound like a numpty.


Why are you making strawman arguments that I've never even come close to making myself? Quit that, it makes you look like a troll.


You don't have the *ability*, you mean, because you haven't done any serious research on the subject, and you don't have an engineering background, so all your arguments are just "I sorta feel this" and "Well I don't know about that".
Some of us do our research and listen to those who know more than we do, and grow for it. Others simply say "Well that's your opinion!" and reject new information and knowledge when it arrives. You don't seem to be in the former category, I'm sad to say.

Domain Keys authentication is *not* reliable enough to be sure. If they're on a shared hosting environment, another person on the same box could theoretically send a DKIM-authenticated message from their domain, if they were clever and determined to.
A PGP-signed message would be a much better thing to put your trust in.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:34:34


Don't worry, no central planners are doing any such thing. Bitcoin is decentralized, and each node operator gets to enforce their own cap. The consensus rules are (by design) *very* difficult to modify, which is actually what gives Bitcoin all its amazing properties that we know and love.


There is no "they", there is only "we", and you can be a part of this "we" by running your own node.


You'll need to calculate the cost of bandwidth, the cost of storage, and the cost of processing a given transaction, sum these together, and then multiply that figure by the number of nodes active on the network. If that cost is larger than the fee paid, you have a sustainability problem.


No, transactions in Bitcoin are public, and it is not just mining nodes that need to process transactions, it is *all* fully-validating nodes.


Indirectly, in a sense, yes.


What is an "artificial cap" in this context? The 4M weight limit is not any more "artificial" than the 21M coin limit is. Both are simply artifacts of the Bitcoin consensus protocol, enforced by full node operators.


That is not my argument. Both Satoshi and I have outright said (in my case, *many* times) that the blocksize limit is *not* an attempt to limit/prevent spam on the network. It does many great things for Bitcoin, and limiting spam happens to be one of them, but that is not why it exists (Satoshi explained this very early on, when he said that the minrelayfee was the first attempt at limiting transaction spam on the network).
If by "legitimate use" you mean "freeloading to the detriment of the network", which it honestly sounds like you do (whether or not you realize it), then you seem to be working from a severe knowledge deficit here. While I am happy to continue explaining things to you (and providing you resources so that you can learn more), you should probably check your tone and try to ask less loaded questions, if you want our dialogue to continue.


Again, the blocksize is not intended as a spam throttle (as Satoshi explained, and I have reiterated here). 
The cap should be as high as it can possibly be without endangering the network's integrity, in my opinion.


I'd like to see the specific calculations (and the assumptions therein) before talking any hard figures, but my guess is that yes, the ideal cap size is larger than 1mb (which would be 0.125MB) and even larger than 1MB (which would be 8mb).
Right now, the max blockweight is 4M (which maps to an approximate 3.7MB cap). I think this might be a *little* bit high for current technology and bandwidth prices, but again, I haven't spent a great deal of time crunching the numbers, and I hesitate to commit to any hard figures before doing so. I like to speak precisely, and I don't like to go on record supporting things that I haven't thoroughly thought through. Maybe that's just me.

This shows me that you're not putting forth a serious argument and would rather troll than be real.
It is a new concept of value to everyone. The switching costs of "what type of money you use/trust/hold" are not trivial, and you know it. People don't freak out when they see national government-issued currencies, because those are familiar for obvious reasons. Bitcoin is a new beast entirely, and the fact that *most* people's immediate kneejerk response is "So it's not 'backed' by anything?" is enough to demonstrate this.
I'm fine with a bit of skepticism, but you're fighting tooth and nail here to preserve a laughable worldview. Take a step back; you can be more than a lame, insincere troll.

People said Bitcoin was a worthless copy+paste job that provided no added utility from the original software it was copied from? Of what codebase, exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:06
No, that's not true. Not if value was added or marginal efficiency was realized (and Bitcoin arguably does both).
I recommend reading the Wikipedia article on [gains from trade]( and then reflecting on the principles therein. If people are able to specialize and then exchange the fruits of their labor with one another, *everyone* can benefit at *no one's* expense.
This demonstrates a very powerful truth, one well worth acknowledging. Every cent of value doesn't have to come from someone else's pocket; cooperation itself can beget value. Bitcoin is a technology that allows us to better harness such cooperation. That's the beauty of it, in fact.
Rather than taking your pessimistic assumptions as unassailable facts, spend some time reading and learning from those who have thought about (and modeled) these things. You might see some wonderful things that you never considered before.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:14:10

That is **exactly** what BCH did.
They launched a new (incompatible) protocol which credited BTC holders with corresponding BCH balances. The same was done for Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and a few other airdropped altcoins.
For an example of a forked altcoin that did *not* issue an airdrop to existing BTC holders, see Litecoin. Litecoin actually changed *less*, code-wise, than most of the aforementioned airdrop coins did, and is (in technical terms) much closer to the original Bitcoin protocol from which it was forked.

Okay, fair enough. Here's the insight: *smart contracts are distinguished from 'dumb' contracts via objective execution*. "Code is law" isn't just a cute phrase, and it's not a principle that can be selectively enforced when you (or anyone) does or does not like the results it produces.
If you remove the cold, uncaring machine enforcement of a smart contract, *it is not a smart contract at all!*
This is definitionally true. It is not an opinion of mine, or something that can be reasonably disagreed with. This is just a basic fact, which is self-evident as long as you understand the definitions of the terms involved.
Ethereum is/was supposed to be a smart contract platform. The entire selling point, the reason that it exists at all, the "value added" over traditional contract platforms, is that it (should) behave as programmed, *no matter what*. If it does not, if there is a non-negligible chance that the program could execute a certain way and some powerful entity (or entities) can reverse or overturn that result, *whether you like it or not*, it means that the platform is not actually a viable smart contract platform. It doesn't do the one thing it was built to do.
Your argument, that "we should make exceptions for the sake of social utility", betrays a deep misunderstanding of the alleged value added by the platform in question. You're basically saying "Let's take the one distinguishing factor of this technology *and remove it*!"
If you are okay with human interference, then we can do everything Ethereum can do (and more!) far more efficiently and for far less cost, in many different ways. 
It's a tough realization to wrap your mind around, because we aren't used to trustless systems and they challenge a lot of assumptions that we have grown up taking for granted. But if you really take the time to grasp the fundamentals of blockchains and how they bring value to the world, you'll understand why the idea of "let's just incorporate a bit of trust in extreme circumstances" is comically misguided.

The point I am making is that your statement "Increasing blocksize to make it more expensive really doesn't change the equation much" is pretty much objectively untrue; the blocksize increase changes the equation by adding a multiplier to the capital expenditure  requirements of the attacker. That's a dramatic change, no matter how you spin it.
An attack being 20x more costly is a huge difference.

That is impossible, because those two things are mutually exclusive. BCH is antithetical to Satoshi's vision, if you examine it rationally.
The dishonest misrepresentation of BCH as "Satoshi's vision" *is a huge part of the problem*; their coin has no technical merit and is objectively worse than most altcoins *even on the properties that they try to distinguish themselves by*, which is why they try so desperately to piggyback on the Bitcoin brand name and pretend like Satoshi would endorse their coin (even to the point of cheering and supporting obvious frauds like Craig Wright).

They do not. As one easy example, miners can include a commitment to an extension block in a coinbase transaction (just like the witness commitment in Segwit is done), allowing for soft-forkability. This sort of approach could potentially introduce [radical changes via a soft-fork]( so it's something that is both exciting and potentially worrisome at the same time.

That's not what happened, though. Once again, you're misrepresenting matters.
In reality, what happened was the following:
1) [You falsely claimed that Bitcoin "wasn't able to deliver on time" as a smart contract platform](
2) [I pointed out that this was false, and that Bitcoin is actually the leading smart contract platform right now.]( This was something that you apparently did not realize (and perhaps still do not). I also explained some of the long-term issues that Ethereum faces, and why its architecture relative to Bitcoin's is less economical and practical, and even elaborated on why misunderstandings on this topic are so pervasive.
3) [You immaturely told me to Google a concept I am obviously intimately familiar with.](
4) [I pointed out that this was not an actual response.](
5) [You (falsely) said "You failed to grasp what a platform is", claimed that Bitcoin is not programmable, and accused me of "empty trolling"]( despite the fact that I was the only one who had written anything insightful or meaningful in the exchange so far, and *you* were completely ignoring everything I had said.
6) [I explained that what you had said was false, and why.]( I also pointed out that you were directly proving my earlier point about altcoiners who refuse to acknowledge the truths that make them uncomfortable.
7) [You once again **falsely** claimed that Bitcoin was "not designed to be programmable money from the start" and then, in a complete non sequitur, told me to look at "tx/s and block time", and then tried to misrepresent me with strawman arguments.](
8) [I pointed out what was happening, noting how many false statements you had made (which you still have not acknowledged the falsehood of), and provided links to multiple resources so that you could learn more.](
9) [You made another strawman argument and showed that you hadn't understood *anything* that I'd been saying this entire time.](
10) [I asked you to re-read the thread.](
I have not been personally attacking you at all, I have simply been patiently correcting the false statements you've been making and providing you with more information in case you are interested in learning the truth or understanding things more than you currently do. I *have* pointed out the tendency for underinformed altcoin proponents to disregard/ignore/hide-from the points and facts that they would rather not acknowledge, and I have also (repeatedly) pointed out that you've provided an excellent example of what I mean here, but I haven't attacked you personally at all.
We *all* start from a state of ignorance, and there's no need to be ashamed of this. It's up to you whether you want to proceed from that state to a state of knowledge and understanding. I'm willing to help, but **you have to actually read and consider what I say** in order for anything like that to happen.


I haven't said that we don't need other coins. Once again, **you're pretending that I made claims that I didn't make** and showing that you haven't actually been reading what I'm writing. I wasn't "haggling about ETH" at all, I was just **correcting the misinformation and misunderstandings that you had** at every step of the way (and apparently there is *plenty* of misunderstanding on your end).
For the final time, I recommend actually reading what was written, rather than fantasizing about dialogue that never actually occurred.

His intent was to highlight all the steps in the process that you were ignoring or glossing over, and the little intricacies that you were taking for granted. Yes, you answered his question, but you haven't yet appreciated his point.


He has just explained this to you.


...or crypto.


If we're being honest, it is. Granted, in first-world contexts citizens who are in good standing with the state and banking sector **are** able to overcome this barrier, but it is *not* nonexistent even if you're personally unwilling to acknowledge it.




Again, granted (at least in the first-world). However, the entirety of your argument here basically boils down to "Bank accounts are the standard right now" while *his* point is along the lines of "Starting from scratch, there *are* many steps and prerequisite conditions that need to be satisfied in order to have and use a bank account, and in a legitimate apples-to-apples comparison between non-crypto and crypto setups, we should explicitly acknowledge these factors."
In other words, if you're going to list out every step on the Bitcoin-side, you should afford the same treatment to the bank-side. Otherwise you're not seeing the full picture.

No, the blockweight limit is what it is, regardless of whether any individual user chooses to use (or abstain from using) SegWit.

3 sat/byte will almost certainly get confirmed, but it might take a few days.
For future reference, you can take a look at [johoe's mempool graphs]( to get a good idea of how long your transactions may take to confirm. As you can see on there, within the past month, every few days the transactions with 3 sat/byte fee-rates get mined.
It's possible that a huge flood of transactions shows up before this happens again, prolonging confirmation, but that's pretty unlikely.

Interesting. If I'm not mistaken, shaolinfry is actually (primarily) a Litecoin developer anyway. I'm sure BIP148 would work on Litecoin, and I'm sure he'd be able to get that done pretty quickly, since he's relatively familiar with the Litecoin codebase.
Also, since the hashrate signaling SegWit support is already over 50% in Litecoin, that sets things up for a smoother and less-risky UASF experience.
Finally, there are fewer big economic players in Litecoin, so it's likely that just getting a couple of key industry figureheads would be enough to establish a solid foundation to work from. Glancing over the Litecoin forums, the users almost unanimously seem pro-SegWit.
This could have a huge benefit for Bitcoin; a successful UASF demonstration in Litecoin would likely go a long way in terms of convincing skeptics over here. If that's one of the objectives (which I personally believe it should be, since Litecoin and Bitcoin can have a virtuous and mutually-beneficial relationship here, where "a rising tide lifts both boats"), and/or you think Litecoin is more "nimble" than Bitcoin, then it would make sense to start the UASF date earlier in Litecoin (maybe June, rather than August).
I might be overlooking something. care to comment?
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:49:36
You're getting a lot of incorrect responses. Here is the truth: SegWit increases the block size. The extra capacity (beyond 1MB) is only available for witness data, though. 
This witness data isn't stored in "a separate database" at all, it is most definitely part of the block. It is simply formatted in a way that makes it easy to strip out, in cases where a non-SegWit node asks for the block data. That way you never send an older node a block bigger than 1MB (which they would reject), because before you sent them anything, your node automatically stripped out the witness data from the block and only *then* sent what was left.
If you actually dive in and look at the transactions' data in the block (the actual bytes themselves) you'll very quickly realize that SegWit doesn't actually "separate" witness data into a separate section of the block (much less a separate database entirely)... all the transaction witness data is in the block, just like normal... it's simply that the SegWit transactions are formatted in a way that makes them easier to work with and easy to strip witness data from, when needed.

I doubt both "Yes" answers, for multiple reasons. 
Firstly, you have provided no corroboration for either claim; you have not qualified your answers beyond a single word answer ("yes"). If you were a software engineer by trade, or even if you had just had a Computer Science group project in college where you had to work with a database, it's likely that you would have gone into more depth, rather than provide a simple affirmative. The fact that you did not take the opportunity to do so, and simply answered "Yes" without any further proof or demonstration of any sort, gives me the impression that you're trying to lie here, to cover up your own naivety in this discussion.
Even more tellingly, the comments that you've already left in this thread obtrusively belie your "Yes" claims. I've been a software engineer for just about two decades now, and it's usually pretty easy to spot the bullshitters from those who know what they're talking about, even if you've only had a fairly short conversation with them. In this case, pretty much every response you've provided has indicated you're not one of the ones that knows what you're talking about; you've repeatedly ignored the most pertinent points that I've raised (e.g. about read/write access roles) and you keep shying away from the technical side of the conversation.
Furthermore, when the questions were first asked, you initially dodged them, which indicates that you were most likely trying to avoid acknowledging your own lack of experience in the matter. 
In any case, I'm not interested in continuing this discussion with you, because there appears to be a fundamental disconnect in our respective understandings of the subject, and you seem to be willing to resort to outright dishonesty in order to "win an argument" rather than being interested in getting to the truth of the matter.

@_date: 2016-02-22 19:29:48
No, you misunderstand how SegWit works. Switching to 15/15 multisig transactions will not make more transactions fit into a block, it will actually make *less* fit into a block. This is because each transaction contains much more information (more signatures) than a simple one-to-one P2PK transaction. From users' perspectives, it is still better to use simpler transactions than more complex ones (because they're smaller and will cost less by way of fees) unless you have a compelling reason to use a complex one (actual need for multisig, or, for example, payment channels).
I can hopefully help clear up why you're confused on this too. Assuming that everyone used 15/15 multisig transactions, the average transaction size in Bitcoin would be relatively huge, and we wouldn't be able to fit that many in a block (in other words, if we all used 15/15 multisig transactions, Bitcoin wouldn't be able to process nearly 2.5 tx/sec... it would actually be a much smaller number than that). With SegWit, a lot of the transaction information (the signatures, to be specific) is segregate/removed from the block, so the transactional footprint is smaller than a blockchain without SegWit. This means 4x as many 15/15 multisig transactions would be able to fit in a block, but **not** that 4x as many transactions would be able to fit into a block.
Here's an extremely simplified example (actual figures not accurate):
Normal transaction: takes up 300 bytes.
15/15 multisig transaction: takes up 3000 bytes.
Normal transaction with SegWit: takes up 200 bytes.
15/15 multisig transaction with SegWit: takes up 800 bytes.
Without SegWit, we can fit about 3000 normal transactions in a block, or about 300 such multisig transactions. With SegWit, we can fit 5000 normal transactions, or about 1200 multisig transactions. 
It is *not* the case that we could fit more 15/15 multisig txs than we could fit normal txs, even with SegWit. If you'll notice, we can fit 4x as many multisig transactions (1200 rather than 300), which is what is meant by "effectively increases the blocksize to ~4MB" in the context of SegWit, but it's only true if **every** transaction used multisig, and even then, we'd be handling **less than half** the number of normal 1-to-1 P2PK transactions that we can handle without SegWit.
Hope that helps.

He didn't ever say that they are using it on mainnet. He just said "I reverse engineered their chip and found out it is designed capable of covert ASICBOOST technology, which would give a considerable advantage to any miner taking advantage of this tech, oh and by the way here's how you can trivially stop it," and *didn't even mention Bitmain by name*. The next day, Bitmain comes out saying "Yeah, that's totally us, we do have chips with that integrated into the hardware. We promise we don't use it on mainnet (even though you never technically accused us of doing so)." Greg never had to prove anything, because they validated his claim firsthand. Whether they are lying about using this feature on mainnet is an exercise to leave to the reader, but remember how many empty blocks AntPool mines, and how their transaction ordering can be a bit *suspicious* sometimes? Something to consider, I'd say.

Right, it was designed so that users could complete for the (necessarily scarce *by design*) network resources via fee-based bidding.
If you don't need to use Bitcoin badly enough to pay competitive fees versus the users that clearly *do*, well, that's fine. Don't use it. It can't be all things to all people; nothing can.


With all due respect, I've been around for many years now, and I know full well what the expectations were, both the early days and in more recent times. It is not my fault that some people (yourself evidently included) don't bother to do enough research to understand the system on a technical level and appreciate the tradeoffs and limitations inherent in the design.
Satoshi (the original small-blocker and perhaps the strongest advocate for decentralization of all) understood them. Most in the development and technical community these days understand them. Casual redditors and newcomers often do not.

Wonderful. Then you acknowledge there is a large material difference, at least in the respect of "how affordable is it to spam the blockchain enough to impact transaction flow on it" between leaving the blocksize as it is, and increasing it by some factor (like 8 or 20). If people will attack it "for the lulz" at the current blocksize-cap, but would abstain from doing so if the cap were increased, then the difference is plain to see.

@_date: 2017-04-14 23:12:38
That's a $0.40 fee, not a $5 one. Lots of transactions have fees in the 40-cent range, that's not abnormal. $5 fees would be abnormal, though, unless it was an absolutely *monstrous* transaction (which, generally, donating $10 will not be). The fees in Bitcoin are per-byte, so it doesn't matter whether you're transferring $0.10 or $10, it matters how big the transaction is in bytes.
As I suspected, your claim was false. Thanks for confirming.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:43:15
You've unfortunately fallen victim to false propaganda. Bitcoin is just as fast as it ever was... in fact, it's programmed to always statistically average out to ten minutes per block, no matter how many transactions are made. You will simply need to use a good wallet, which allows you to specify your transaction fee, to send your coins, and you will be able to get them to any address you want in less than an hour and for about $1 or less.
The "transactions that never get processed" are almost always those that pay insufficient fees (like $0.05 when the "competitive rate" would be more like $0.30). You may notice that *all* of these fee-rates I'm quoting are relatively small... these are accurate figures, though. If you've budgeted about $5 (in total) for fees, and you don't do anything really weird (like craft huge transactions comprised of thousands of tiny "dust" inputs), then you can get your transactions confirmed in a matter of a few minutes, without fail. I do it all the time.
So, no, the network is not getting any slower as long as you pay competitive fees (which, at least for now and the foreseeable future, will remain very affordable).
You should also have no problem selling your coins, should you choose to do so. How exactly you do so depends on what country you live in, but there are plenty of options. You might want to sell half your stash now, just to convince yourself that you are able to, and maybe buy back some of that stash if you're convinced that there's not as much to worry about as you had heard. Personally, that's how I would play it if I were you.
A lot of people will try to spin things to make it sound like Bitcoin is doomed doomed *doooomed*, but generally they're just trying to convince you to buy their altcoin instead. In other words, they're almost always snake-oil salesmen. If you pay close enough attention this becomes pretty obvious.

I'm pretty sure theymos got the same alert key that Gavin did, and I don't hear people trying to say theymos was Satoshi's hand-chosen successor or anything like that. Even thinking in those terms shows just how much you *don't* get Bitcoin. There is no leader, that would be antithetical to its purpose.

You have it backwards. The limit won't be raised when there's no need for it to be raised. If the Greeks suddenly start buying Bitcoin in droves, and blocks begin to fill with actual commerce, the limit would be raised without serious contention or controversy.
It baffles me that so many here don't understand this. The network is designed to respond to challenges and needs as they arise. Expecting it to instead preemptively solve and overcome every conceivable obstacle is absurd and childlike.
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:10:32


This is incorrect, actually. SegWit transactions are often larger than legacy transactions. However, SegWit increased the blocksize limit (or more accurately, *removed* the blocksize limit and replaced it with a block*weight* limit which is larger) to allow more transactions to fit into each block.
Of course, more importantly, it also provided a malleability-free transaction mechanism that allows second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network or eltoo to work.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:18:22

@_date: 2016-02-01 19:58:26
Examples of what?
I can explain the concept of sidechains and two-way pegs if you'd like... is that what you're after?
Or do you want to know what will happen to all altcoins once the two-way peg mechanism goes live? That one is obvious, once you understand what sidechains represent... in short, all altcoins will be absorbed into Bitcoin*. Their functionality and technical distinctions will be preserved, but the tokens of their respective blockchains will each be redeemable for actual bitcoins, i.e. all cryptocurrency will share one primary ledger, but multiple different implementations and innovations and experimentations will be possible using the native tokens of that ledger.
\* Bitcoin does not necessarily have to be the "one ledger that rules them all", but whatever coin has the largest market cap at the time when sidechains go live will almost certainly fill that niche. All other coins (altcoins) will almost necessarily be destroyed and will rise again as sidechains backed by the  coin at the time (most likely Bitcoin, but not strictly necessarily so).
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:58:04
They are most certainly exclusive. If you're running SegWit, you properly validate against blockweight. If you're using BU, you are running an obsolete version of Core (multiple major-version releases and thousands of commits out-of-date) with some weird Emergent Consensus nonsense thrown on top (along with a buggy and inefficient Xthin blocks thing, rather than nice, performant Compact Blocks, among other shortcomings). They are objectively incompatible.

Once most transactions are using SW, assuming the transaction profile of the network remains similar to what it is today, about 1.6x as many transactions will be able to fit into a block compared to what fits today.
The insight that you appear to be struggling with is that multisig transactions right now are quite large, so we can't fit very many of them in a block (relatively speaking). With SW, these transactions would not be as large (though **they would still be larger than normal non-multisig transactions**) so we could fit 2-4x as many *multisig* transactions in a block than we can right now. This does **not** mean people will start using multisig so that they can pay cheaper fees, because multisig transactions will **always be larger than non-multisig ones**... there is just more *savings* when it comes to multisig transactions than there is for standard ones (because more signature data can be segregated).
I hope that makes sense. SegWit is cool stuff, a bit hard to wrap your mind around, but cool stuff nonetheless.

I think you misunderstand... this blog post 100% *confirms* Greg's claim. To remind you what his claim actually was, it was that mining chips produced by a major manufacturer in the space (which was later confirmed to be Bitmain) has ASICBOOST logic set up on a hardware level. He didn't say that they are using this (though, obviously, they are).
This Bitmain blog post proves that Greg's claim was correct. They admit that their chips do have this implemented into the hardware. They claim that they have not used it except on testnet (which makes no sense, of course, because they expended serious resources to both patent and build it), but that isn't even relevant! They just said "Greg is right, but we promise that we're not exploiting this even though it would be profitable to do, and even though we've spent a lot of money to be able to do so, and even though all the data (like our disproportionately high number of empty blocks) indicates that we *do!*"

Whenever someone says something this dismissive (Peter Todd is a recurring culprit) I laugh out loud.
*Never* are these claims actually substantiated with real figures, facts, arguments, or analysis. It's obvious why: they're not true. Any attempt at supportive arguments would fail comically.
I don't disagree with anything else you wrote, and definitely believe off-chain solutions will be the best approach to scaling Bitcoin (and so will be the ones used). I'm a huge fan of LN and I'm even a supporter (for the most part) of Core's roadmap. I understand Big O and its relevance to Bitcoin growth and scaling. In short, I don't disagree with your primary point.
What I *do* disagree with is how you (and Todd) just make inane blanket statements like "IT'S SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR LAYER-1 BITCOIN TO INCLUDE X QUANTITY OF TRANSACTIONS" when this can be trivially refuted in any number of ways. 
We could brutishly upgrade to 1TB blocks, and fit everything we could ever want into the Blockchain directly. Would many people keep mining? Of course not. Is this a good idea? Of course not.
But it *does* prove you wrong, conclusively. It's not "simply impossible" to include high numbers of transactions on the Blockchain. At all. The tradeoffs necessary to achieve this might not be worth it in the face of superior alternatives, but that doesn't matter. "Impossible" means "impossible", not "inefficient".

I am pasting a [(very relevant) comment]( that u/Lejitz made a short while ago:
**This is important to understand regarding the political implications BIP148 on Vertcoin and MASF on Litecoin.**
Vertcoin is the new battleground.  Here's why:
The only reason Jihan wanted to block SegWit on litecoin was to make it politically easier to block SegWit on Bitcoin; a favorable precedent for SegWit makes arguing against it more difficult.  Blocking SegWit on Bitcoin is all about protecting ASICBoost.  Ultimately, however, Jihan is fine if Litecoin activates SegWit, so long as Bitcoin does not.
A UASF is the biggest threat to successfully activate SegWit on Bitcoin, therefore, Jihan would like to show a UASF to be dangerous.  Accordingly, Jihan needs a UASF attempt to fail in order to set an unfavorable precedent, making it more difficult to win support for in Bitcoin.  But this can only happen with a majority of hash power willfully attacking a UASF after activation.  Jihan does not have the ability to successfully attack Litecoin, so he is better off miner-activating SegWit on Litecoin.  Otherwise, a favorable precedent will be set for BIP148.
**Enter Vertcoin.**  Last week, it appeared that Vertcoin was about to miner-activate SegWit (and Litecoin was likely to implement a UASF).  All of the sudden, someone blocked activation by adding more than 100% of Vertcoin's prior-existing hashrate to their network.  This miner now has more than 51% of the hashrate and is signaling against SegWit.  As a response, Vertcoin is implementing BIP148.
Now, the roles are reversed, Vertcoin is implementing a UASF and Litecoin is miner-activating.   But unlike Litecoin, it is possible to successfully attack Vertcoin.  First, the hash power is readily available to successfully 51% attack.  Second, the market cap is low enough to successfully manipulate the price action to give the post-attack impression that the market is accepting the non-SegWit chain.
In essence, by switching the rolls of Litecoin and SegWit, Jihan could establish enough FUD against a UASF that the only option for activating SegWit on Bitcoin through miners.  Of course, in order to protect ASICBoost, this will never happen.  Bitcoin will be stuck with Jihan as its ruler.
Right now, Vertcoin may need some help to thrive through the coming attacks.
We have a choice.  Vertcoin can either be an example of why a UASF is the way to go, or it will be the perfect example of what can go wrong.

A couple of corrections:
1) rbtc was not created by Roger Ver. It wasn't even originally created as a reference to Bitcoin. Ownership was eventually transferred to Roger Ver in what was almost certainly an under-the-table purchase (in violation of reddit's Terms of Service). The user who (probably) sold the subreddit to Roger Ver now has their account suspended, though Ver's account remains in control of the subreddit (and he pays the salaries of most of the mods there, too).
2) rbtc has never been "free speech", it has just been disingenuously marketed as such. In reality, thousands and thousands of posts have been manually removed by Ver's employees in moderator positions there... for instance, if the word "bcash" is used to refer to BCH it is more often than not removed from the subreddit as wrongthink. When the removing moderator feels particularly sassy, they paste a tired and misleading copypasta referencing a nonexistent coin/project as if that justifies their obviously-political and blatantly-biased behavior. Likewise, hundreds of users have been banned from the subreddit, often without any legitimate grounds (or at least none that the pro-bcash regulars there are not infinitely more guilty of on an ongoing basis).
These two points are significant notes.

Much better. Once you start introducing words like "distributed" into the picture, you get a lot closer to a meaningful definition of a blockchain.
Yes, a blockchain involves a strictly ordered set of data. My point was that solely meeting this criteria does not qualify something as a blockchain. 
A book/novel is a "strictly ordered set of data", but it would be ridiculous to claim that "Green Eggs and Ham" by Dr. Seuss is a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:37:14
Question: why isn't "Blocksize increase" included in the SegWit column? The table is highly misleading because of this omission.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:43:12
SegWit doesn't fix "block malleability", it provides a new *transaction format* which isn't third-party malleable. This new transaction format is optional, by the way... Users would still be able to make old-style (fully malleable) transactions if they wanted to.
If you have a non-malleable transaction format, you can do all sorts of wonderful things (much more easily) like second-layer solutions that provide massive benefits across the board.
SegWit also increases the capacity of each block directly on-chain, by increasing the maximum blocksize. Since this has been rather loudly demanded by a subset of users for a couple of years now, you would think that they would be very much in favor of SegWit, but inexplicably some of the less-than-rational members of this group have started outright lying about SegWit and pretending that it *doesn't* increase the blocksize and resisting it fervently.
It was recently discovered that the "witness commitment" that SegWit miners put into their coinbase transaction also has an interesting side-effect of preventing the "covert ASICBOOST" exploit, which is basically a way for miners to secretly "cheat" the proof-of-work requirements in Bitcoin by skipping some of the process. This exploit also encourages the miners to mine empty or less-efficient blocks, which further restricts capacity on the blockchain, without any benefit to users. It is also patented, which means that the miners on the right side of the patent get to prevent others from abusing the exploit (while they continue doing so), which can trend mining towards an ugly monopoly, and kill the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin entirely.
SegWit wouldn't singlehandedly prevent ASICBOOST entirely, but it would make it so that any miners who are doing so have to be "out in the open" so that everyone can see that they are using it.
About the "voting", what has actually happened is that there is something called "versionbits" which basically allows miners to signal, with their blocks, what protocol upgrades (soft forks) they are ready for. It is a "readiness signal", rather than a "vote", per se, and has historically worked well up until SegWit went through the same process. Because SegWit eliminates the "unfair advantage" that a mining conglomerate in China has managed to set up, they have very forcefully resisted it and not only failed to signal readiness, but made demands of other pools to not do so, as well as championed an extremely amateur (and fundamentally foolish) "alternative" instead. 
There is no "killing" of SegWit; the malicious miners who are "blocking" it are merely delaying its activation. 
To balance out the incentives properly, a new proposal has arrived, which basically does nothing but block the "covert ASICBOOST" exploit. Since this proposal does nothing other than that (and the malicious miners promise that they're not abusing the exploit anyway), it should be uncontroversial and likely adopted very rapidly by every miner who isn't using the exploit themselves, in order to increase their competitiveness and their bottom line. It will likely just need a majority of miner support, rather than a supermajority.
Once this is active, there will be much less reason for any opposition to SegWit (other than "hurt feelings" and "revenge"), so we will see then how the readiness-signaling evolves afterwards.

It's even more interesting (i.e. worse) than that. If you were such a miner and really wanted to be nasty, you could fill your blocks up with your own transactions, but never broadcast the transactions to other miners at all (except in the completed blocks). 100% of your fees would go to yourself, in that scenario, and with 50% hashrate that means that normal users only get to really make use of every other block (other than the top-paying ones that you  include in your blocks for the fee revenue).

Interesting. Could, of course, be theoretically manually crafted, but the more likely case is that this indicates that they are actually finally running a version of Core &gt;0.13.0. I know they were holding off on upgrading, if I recall correctly it had to do with getting a stable Debian build of C++11 binaries. It makes sense that if they were upgrading their Litecoin pool's nodes to SegWit-ready code (which, similarly, needs a C++11 Debian build), that they would get the job done for Bitcoin, too.
So, this "signal everything for April Fool's" move by Wang Chun actually had a subtler signal contained in it, it seems: *he's running SegWit-capable code, even though he isn't signaling for its activation at the moment.*

First off, smart contracts do **not** require Turing-completeness. At all. 
The interesting (tricky) part of any smart contract is the **oracle** component. With a perfect oracle and Bitcoin, I can do anything you could ever want, smart-contract wise, with a simple 2-of-3 multisig setup. Without a solid oracle component, neither Bitcoin nor any other altcoin is going to boast meaningfully-interesting smart contracts. Toy gambling apps are about as good as you're ever going to get, without solving the oracle problem. Because without an oracle, ultimately your contract cannot interact with the real world, and will have to regress back to trust. And if you're okay with letting trust determine outcome, you don't need Bitcoin *or* any other crypto.
Secondly, *no blockchains have a Turing Complete language anyway*. No, not even King Shitcoin. Execution is bounded by gas costs (or an equivalent) anywhere you look, which translates to "not Turing Complete after all". But let us be very clear here: being Turing Complete *would not be a good thing*, because it doesn't actually help with the tricky bit of making smart contracts relevant to the real world; once again, this comes down to your oracle solution, not your programming language.


I never said you did.


Of course. Just remember how long markets can remain irrational for. Don't expect me to be proven right for *at least* a few years.
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:40:27
This is incorrect. SegWit increases the blocksize, period. The witness data is still part of the block, it's not "stored in a separate database" in any sense whatsoever. It's actually not even segregated, in terms of serialized bytes, it's just cleanly identifiable so that it is strippable when an older client requests a given block's data.

They find a solution without doing *all* the work. Basically, they're able to cut corners. They get a bigger advantage when they do so with empty blocks, too.
Oh, and they can't continue cutting those corners if we activate any of a long list of upgrades in the pipeline. So, rather than lose their competitive edge by allowing Bitcoin to grow and flourish, they block all these upgrades and stymie growth.

Nope. Ethereum is not Turing Complete. This is a basic fact. Even the creator(s) admit as much. 
Were you really under the impression that it was?


No, I didn't. You can't just say "You implied X" when someone didn't say anything even remotely resembling **X** in their arguments and statements. What hogswash.

There is no longer a blocksize limit, it was deprecated and replaced with a blockweight limit in August 2017. This increased the "size limit" of valid Bitcoin blocks (a little more than doubling the previous limit) and also introduced a new transaction serialization mechanism that avoids unwanted malleability, allowing second-layer solutions to flourish. So now those who want or need dirt-cheap Bitcoin transactions can have them, because the limit was increased *and* the foundations for higher layers of the Bitcoin stack were laid.
It's not likely that yet another limit increase will gain consensus in the near term future, because almost everyone with a baseline level of understanding of the subject realizes the drawbacks (both social and technical) of such a proposal far outweigh the potential benefits. It's not even clear what would motivate such a proposal being made right now, other than ignorance.
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:23:51
That's not quite right. Hashrate doesn't define policy at all, full nodes do. Miners can pick what ruleset they mine, though.
Hard forks are just backwards-incompatible changes. A full node that doesn't update to be compatible with a hard fork will simply ignore any blocks that are mined on that fork.
If the economic majority enforces the rules of the UASF, it will be successful. Basically if all the money commits to the UASF, there is no use in mining any other branches, because they would not be worth anything.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:45:01
Well it basically gives a faux proof of work, 30% less work-proof is provided than an alternative proof that did not abuse the exploit. The exploit also motivates very "tragic" (and I use that word in the economical sense) transactional processor behavior, e.g. empty blocks and inefficient transaction ordering. And it looks as if a privileged minority are able to benefit from exploiting this, which means that the remaining majority has every incentive to patch it. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:55:03
Also very true. That's part of why I included the "for many reasons" bit above.

"Quality of code" very much includes the merit of the ideas that go into the code. Any developer worth their salt spends the bulk of their focus and effort (for any non-trivial project) in the design and planning phase.
The end result (the actual source code itself) is a product of the ideas that go into it. When I say "quality of code" I am most certainly referring to the ideas and design that the code represents.

Are you serious right now? Read the quote again.
**More complicated multi-signature transactions save even more.** So once everybody has moved their coins to segregated witness-locked outputs and all transactions are using segregated witness, two or three times as many transactions would squeeze into the one megabyte block limit.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:29:50

Every Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract. Smart contracting has been a part of Bitcoin since day one; that's the reason why Script exists in the first place.
An excellent example of a useful, economically sensible smart contract construct is the Lightning Network, which uses HTLCs to achieve noncustodial effectively-instant value transfer.
What Bitcoin *doesn't* natively support is single-transaction Turing expressivity, i.e. Script predicates/encumbrances aren't arbitrarily flexible. A little-recognized fact is that *neither does Ethereum*, which is one reason why the Ethereum Foundation pivoted their marketing strategy a few years ago from "Turing complete!" to "richly stateful" instead (which is far from the only example of their "change our sales brochure because the original pitch didn't hold up" antics).
Unfortunately, just like the ridiculous fetishization of base-layer throughput in the blockchain world, the meme that "Bitcoin can't do smart contracts but Ethereum can" has surprisingly powerful sticking power, probably because most people aren't software engineers and don't have the time, knowledge, or energy necessary to determine the actual truth of the matter. Oh well.

Even if you contend that 100% of the "Unknown" mining pools are GHash, you have a maximum of [7% hashrate]( that could possibly be under their control. A far cry from the 30-40% they enjoyed in their heyday.

A mostly decent writeup, but off-the-mark in a couple of ways. One particularly obvious flub was how he said that Maxwell "estimated" that Bitmain controls 50% of the network hashrate. He did no such thing. Setting aside the fact that Greg didn't mention Bitmain in his email at all, he never once in the email conjectured about the hashrate various pools control. He simply showed what sort of impact such exploits could have on big mining enterprises' bottom line(s). He wasn't even assuming that Bitmain controls 51% hashrate (and that's a misunderstanding of what the word "assuming" implies in the sort of context that Maxwell used it here). He was simply generating ballpark figures for a hypothetical 51%-hashrate-abuser, to put things in perspective (just like Satoshi does in the original whitepaper).
Again, he wasn't meticulously calculating what he actually estimated Bitmain's profit to be. Not at all. That would have been inappropriate for a dev mailing list, anyway.

Excellently stated. Spot on. You have a way with words.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:30:22
You're right. Furthermore, if you intend to *eventually* support SegWit and let the price skyrocket, it's in your best interest to milk your competitive advantage as much as possible beforehand, and accumulate/stockpile bitcoins in preparation for the moonlaunch.
At this point, though, I worry that Jihan Wu stands to lose too much face by letting Bitcoin upgrade smoothly, and will stubbornly oppose it even if it is an economically irrational thing to do.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:32:56
Most of them do not use Bitcoin, actually. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:38:10
It seems to me that two or three key exchanges that handle Litecoin agreeing to run UASF code (honestly just Poloniex and BTC-e would be sufficient) would be all that is needed.
Litecoin already has &gt;50% of miner signaling for SegWit, and the users seem pretty unanimously supportive of it. The creator himself fervently supports it, too. What would make it particularly smooth, in Litecoin's case, is the fact that it has a relatively small "industry" compared to Bitcoin. Even if *just* Poloniex got on board, that would probably be enough for a successful UASF. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:07:50
No, it doesn't.
Basically, the question of whether ASICBOOST should be tolerated on the network is a separate concern entirely. The BIP Greg is proposing would simply mean "To boost, it has to be detectable" (along with the nice side effect of eliminating the incentive to resist a list of upgrades in the Bitcoin pipeline).
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:13:26
But what are your thoughts on sidechains?
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:37:43
You missed the point. You said "by definition" and I just proved that this is untrue.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:29:42
They are indeed part of the market. Like I said, I can buy my bitcoins via Bitmain (with an Antminer) or via Coinbase (with a direct deposit). Either way, I am having my Bitcoin demand satsified, taking supply that would otherwise be available to the rest of the market.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:06:15


Many soft forks have already activated smoothly with that same threshold. It seems that the only reason SegWit has not (yet) is because it nullifies the covert ASICBOOST exploit as a side effect, and Bitmain is desperate to both keep this exploit secret and preserve it as a competitive advantage.
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:16:13
Haha, I remember that, too. What a badge of honor.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:30:17
My brilliant idea (in terms of scaling) is: activate SegWit, as implemented in modern versions of Core.
The problem right now is that one mining kingpin (Jihan Wu) is actively working to prevent Bitcoin from scaling smoothly right now. It's unclear right now whether his motives are to maximize profits in some way, or alternatively, to attack and/or undermine Bitcoin.
If you are asking for my idea(s) in terms of resolving the gridlock that this malicious kingpin has achieved, I unfortunately do not have a satisfactory plan at this time. User-activated soft-fork seems like the best approach proposed yet, but this would require extraordinary coordination among the rest of the industry to safely execute, and currently I'm not terribly optimistic that this will occur.
Other than that, my suggestion is that we wait. Ignorance tends to expose itself, given ample time and opportunity to do so, and markets tend to route around hostility nicely if given enough time.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:15:39
Jihan has admitted this on a number of occasions, as have miners and pool operators who buy from him. Go through Jihan's twitter account, or through GBMiners reddit account, or ask Bruce Fenton, or spend 6 minutes Googling the subject.
This isn't a secret, and has never been. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:19:21
If you feel the code is in a stable and tested-enough state to be merged into Core, simply submit a PR for review. It will either be rejected or accepted. You may need to implement the `-forceactive` flag functionality yourself, but that wouldn't be too difficult.

That is precisely what they did. They refused to instate fees even after reaching a threatening hashrate, and the community repeatedly demanded that they adjust their policy for the good of the ecosystem. They refused to do so, and the community (including BitFury) eventually withdrew their miners from the pool, as rational actors should do in that situation.

Decentralization achieves a lot more than just censorship resistance. It's silly to pretend otherwise.
Inflation-resistance is one obvious example of another benefit of decentralization. Free and open market competition of ideas, tools, and services is another. Open protocol access (i.e. low entry-barriers) is another.
Censorship resistance is important, of course, but decentralization is not just a means to that single end.

You're obviously a troll; every single element of your response here corroborates this fact.


I do, indeed.


Good thing that wasn't actually my "window of analysis" at all. This is a multi-week correlation we've seen, at this point, though admittedly the more pronounced movements occur relatively rapidly (in a matter of hours, after relevant news breaks).


Already covered in the links. Obviously you didn't actually read them (either that or you're deliberately ignoring the key information included in them, like trolls so often do). The ETF decision occurred, then the price recovered and stabilized for a few days, and then once AntPool started signaling, it began tanking in response. Unless you think that the Ghost of the ETF awoke to wreak havoc after an extended slumber (coincidentally at the same time that AntPool made their move), which I guess you are free to believe. 


Also covered in the links. Try reading the links, because this is pretty thoroughly debunked. In fact, about 90% of the content in the links is concentrated entirely on this exact fallacy.


Yes, as imminent SegWit activation on Litecoin has caused the price to roughly triple in less than a month, and recent revelations have exposed exactly why Bitmain has opposed SegWit so irrationally (which sets Bitcoin up nicely to overthrow this malicious empire with a quick and painless patch). Thank you for accidentally supporting my point.

*sigh*... trolls gonna troll, I suppose. Again, if you click the links, all of your arguments were debunked many days before you even made them. The price initially started dropping right after AntPool's signaling began (the 7th), and I submitted a post about it at the time. Then the ETF happened, the price dropped, then recovered, and then hovered just-under-$1300 for a few days before the BU hard fork fears started boiling over. Go back and read the entire Daily Thread context that my links are from; it's the only thing anyone was talking about, and numerous traders were saying they were selling their holdings (and/or shorting) based off of the BU threat.

Sort of, yeah. What a bummer that miners didn't honor that agreement, huh? Just think how much better everything would be, if SegWit were active on mainnet!
Really makes you a little bit upset with the mining pools (and all their centralized – and currently abused – power), but I just don't see what the best way to achieve progress is, in cases of complex incentive mismatches like this. Miners want higher fees, users want lower ones. Personally, I think this is going to be an eternal battle that we have to put up with, in Bitcoin... our equivalent of "middlemen" are the miners, after all. We have a dichotomy on our hands.
Open market competition, I predict, will reshape everything dramatically. Mining will, some way somehow, find a way to extract the most profit from the system... and in all likelihood, that will entail much, much pricier bitcoins, in the end. We just have to play our hodl (and/or trade) game as best we can in the meantime, you and I.

It's spam if it represents no actual economic value or usage. I understand that this is hard to measure objectively (and therein lies the rub), but it's the best definition of spam that we have, so far, in my opinion.
Consider the scenario of a miner who fills up their blocks with transactions to themselves (which they have kept secret and not broadcast to any other miners). Perhaps each of these transactions includes a 1BTC fee, in fact. They are not risking that fee being collected by any other miners, because they never broadcast their transactions until they are fully included in a block. They might do such a thing to artificially inflate the "suggested fee rate" on the network, and thereby increase their revenue as real users adjust accordingly.
Now, even though this miner included (extremely large) fees with all their transactions, I don't think it's valid to say "Those transactions are not spam! They have fees included!" After all, these fees were never actually paid, because they went straight back into the pocket of the miner who made the transactions in the first place. They clearly *are* spam (or some other new word that amounts to basically the same thing, if you'd prefer).
This is just *one* illustrative example of why we can't label any transaction with a fee as necessarily "not spam", if I sat down and really tried, I could furnish plenty more. But the point here is that we need more criteria than just "fee or no fee" to make such a determination, *especially* when the big miners have recently demonstrated obvious incentive incompatibility with non-mining users to such a degree that we can appropriately call them "malicious" and have a strong case for doing so.

Besides the Segwit2X takeover attempt, the misrepresenting of Bitpay surcharges as "network fees", and other anti-Bitcoin deceptive propaganda (some of which has been covered in the replies you've already gotten), they also attempt to *force* users to use their BIP70 format (which many Bitcoin wallets aren't compatible with), which has prompted solutions like [DeBitpay]( to spring up. In other words, the community has had to build solutions just to convert Bitpay invoices into actual Bitcoin addresses that can be paid normally.
Bitpay is anti-Bitcoin, and they have been markedly so ever since Bitmain paid them many millions of dollars back in 2017 (or possibly even earlier). It's not difficult to figure out why.

Nope, wrong in numerous ways. First, there was no such thing as "Bitcoin Core" back when Satoshi was still actively developing Bitcoin. Second, Satoshi didn't "leave Gavin in control" of any codebase whatsoever; Satoshi used Sourceforge for his version control platform, and at one point Gavin decided to port the source code over to GitHub, and Satoshi didn't object. Later, Gavin claimed (many times) that Satoshi "left him in charge", which was eventually requoted and appears to have fooled many people (yourself included), especially because Gavin liked to refer to himself as the "Chief Scientist of Bitcoin" (leaving off the critical "Foundation" which is an important qualifier, considering how incredibly disreputable that Foundation is now perceived to be).
Gavin did indeed step down as lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, many years later, because he had not been contributing any code for some time prior. You got that part right.
But, again, Satoshi didn't "leave Gavin in control" in any sense. You just heard Gavin say so (or someone else quote Gavin), and didn't do your research on the subject.

I was inevitably downvoted and called nasty names as a result, and after 5 or 6 of these episodes (linking to hundreds of removed threads) I got bored of doing so, and stopped bothering. You can go through my post history to see plenty of proof, or you could glance at the mod logs yourself sometime to witness it firsthand.


Yes, this sub is about discussing *Bitcoin*, not other subreddits (even though in come cases their loud and fraudulent behavior makes them tangentially relevant to Bitcoin and mentions do arise here on occasion). In contrast, rbtc is basically a corporate subreddit run by Ver who has decided that the most successful marketing strategy is to lambast Bitcoin and the fora used to discuss it which he doesn't own outright.

False. Classic wasn't affected by the *first* exploit, but was affected by multiple subsequent XThin-remote-exploits. Tom Zander even expressed annoyance with how BU disclosed their bug, because it caused so many Classic nodes to die after the exploiters realized it was similarly vulnerable.
Classic is just a clone of BU these days, anyway, with a couple of buggy Xander additions thrown in. It's not really a serious independent project.

I'm honestly so tired with know-nothings chiming in with suggestions on this subject, without having done any serious research first. 
I've personally witnessed Voorhees confronted with the various reasons why this proposal is a poor one, just to see him stop responding and flee the conversation. Either the guy is too invested in his altcoin business to genuinely want what is best for Bitcoin, or he is remaining willfully ignorant on the subject for inexplicable reasons. Either possibility is worrying.
Do your part, downvote this nonsense, and move on. Bad ideas need attention like a flame needs oxygen; deprive them of it, and they will quickly die.

It just means that the coins/outputs currently exist in that "location"... every coin, or chunk of coin, that exists at this moment is "unspent". A spent output is one that has already been sent somewhere else. "Unspent" basically means "waiting to be spent again", not that it has never moved since being mined.

I don't know how to say this without sounding condescending, but you still don't seem to understand what you're talking about. Nothing about a DAO would solve the problem that is being discussed. You're basically trying to change the subject without realizing it, and the actual original subject is going over your head.
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:27:47




You are (severely) confused. Sub-satoshi-per-byte fees are trivial to achieve without messing with *any* consensus-critical rules or code. Just change the minrelayfee settings on a node to accept lower fees. Change it to 0.5 satoshis per byte, or 0.2, or whatever you want. No soft forks necessary. The FeeRate is actually [specified in the code]( as satoshis per kB, so it's particularly easy to do this.
You're talking about easy-to-update *policy* code (not consensus code) which already has much more granularity out-of-the-box than you seem to think. Even if it didn't (i.e. if the offered granularity wasn't quite enough) it could be updated to handle fractional fee-rates, rounding up to the nearest satoshi where necessary. 


Factually speaking, we know that this is not true, and that demand for Bitcoin transaction confirmation is **far** higher (and more inelastic) than you're assuming. This simply isn't realistic; blocks are routinely full even when *all* transactions therein include fees significantly larger than this.


Again, totally and blatantly false.
Without intending to be rude here, your comment is comprised of pure nonsense.

This will be the last response I provide until there is some indication that you've understood (or even made a genuine effort to *try* to understand) any of what I've written. There's no need for me to feed the trolls, and it's becoming more and more clear that this is what's happening.
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:46:40


I can set up a simple program that takes an input string, like "Hello", and then spits out an output string that is the input string, reversed: "olleH".
Does that mean my program "is aware of something outside of itself, namely the string 'Hello'"? In a sense... but only as an input. You're really stretching the definition of the word "aware" here, beyond the point where it remains valuable as a term.
If you want to argue that Bitcoin is "alive" then you have to bundle in the community (us squishy humans) as part of the organism, analogous to cells or perhaps neurons. You are certainly free to model things in this way (it is totally valid), but if you're willing to take that approach, realize that there are plenty of other superorganisms that predate Bitcoin. A corporation is an excellent example; corporations have an awareness of "me" and "not me" and an incentive to survive and generate the maximum possible profits for shareholders. A nation-state (country) is another example. A college or high school is another example.
Is Bitcoin any more "self-aware" than these other entities? Not particularly.


Not necessarily; you're anthropomorphizing it a bit. Of course, this does seem like a natural path to follow (especially from our human perspective), but again, note that plenty of other types of superorganisms do the same thing.


I don't follow. Why would it?


Possible, but so unlikely that we can safely rule it out.

The "market cap" metric is bogus. The "market cap percentage dominance index" is even worse. These metrics are trivially gameable in a hundred different ways, and have been abused accordingly for years now.

To wit: SegWit, bech32, Schnorr sigs, MAST, Taproot, Graftroot, bulletproofs, Confidential Transaction and CoinJoin stuff, Liquid, Lightning Network, eltoo, and continued optimizations on the wallets, libraries, and Core client.
Bitcoin technical development is on another level. Of course, there's no central marketing department for Bitcoin (like there is with so many altcoins) hyping this stuff, and most of the tech is relatively tricky to even begin to understand or appreciate, so casual observers tend to assume that "Bitcoin development is stagnant" and/or "Altcoins ABC and XYZ are so much more technically advanced than Bitcoin, which is a blockchain dinosaur" even though both of these assumptions are completely backwards.
The only altcoin that can boast anything even remotely comparable to Bitcoin in terms of developer attention is Ethereum, but even Ethereum is debatably a distant second on this front, considering [how most of their protocol's fundamentals are still completely up-in-the-air and they're still in a "throw shit at the wall until something sticks" phase]( and the massive qualitative differences between the respective "technical depths" of development in Bitcoin and Ethereum; to push forward and really expand the frontiers of Bitcoin tech, it pretty much requires *extreme* expertise with regards to cryptography, math, computer science, and/or economics, whereas Ethereum attracts and caters to casual programmers who often know the basics of Javascript and not much else. It's a "quality vs quantity" thing, ultimately.

Great article. I've been expounding the same reasoning for years now. 
At this point, the significance of "Marketcap" in crypto is almost entirely [reflexive]( in nature: a lot of people think it matters, so it *does* matter (at least, it does to those people, who are part of the market). Even though the belief is ultimately rooted in ignorance, it still has an effect on the market at large.
The best we can do is to continue reasoning things through, doing our best to recognize the (sometimes huge) flaws in the metrics we look at, and educate each other about what we notice and realize.
Again, great article.

Not really, from what I've seen. Turing completeness is not difficult criteria to meet; Satoshi deliberately made Bitcoin Script not so for valid and rational readons. The implementation of Ethereum itself is laughably misguided, in a number of ways, and that's even before you take into account the whole "oh shit, a 'smart contract' didn't execute as expected, better hard-fork to undo it and sacrifice everything the project was supposed to stand for in the process!" fiasco that came of the DAO.

The per-transaction PoW doesn't actually solve the *real* problem (which is that double-spends are possible), because currently the difficulty doesn't grow exponentially so an attacker can just brute force a lot of work to execute a double-spend.

Yes, though if you're expecting to be able to "time the bottom" you're probably going to wind up just missing the boat. There's no guarantee that the next bear market will be multiple years long (in fact, that was the longest bear market in Bitcoin's history and a bit of an anomaly in this respect). 
To quote a comment of mine from a little over three months ago:




Bitcoin has a habit of shooting up a few thousand percent, and then going through a significant retracement to find a new (higher) price floor after doing so. The "bear phase" (like we might be entering right now) is what makes [Dollar Cost Averaging]( a particularly intelligent acquisition strategy, because you wind up getting a relatively large stake during the interval that prices are low.
So while trolls tempted by schadenfreude are predictably going to come crawling out of the woodworks, remember that the price being "low" represents a buying opportunity if you're in the game for the long haul.

You might think so, unless you knew what you were talking about.
Again, if you don't understand the engineering here, it's better to listen than to talk. You have demonstrated 3 times in 3 successive comments that you don't know what you're talking about, even though you don't seem aware of this yet.
If you want to learn more and become less blatantly ignorant, your best option is to go look at the commits and diffs of Bitcoin Classic, which was the "change the bare minimum amount of code to hard-fork to 2MB" implementation attempt (before it was effectively abandoned months ago because it lacked any serious devs to maintain the repo). You'll notice that there's actually a comparable amount of code changed as there is with SegWit, and fortunately each commit is accompanied by an explanation or rationale to describe why the code is being changed or updated in the way that it is. Long story short: a **lot** more than one line needs to be changed to hard-fork the blocksize up without breaking everything, and the update is ugly and clunky from an engineering standpoint.
But let's be honest; you don't intend to rectify your ignorance, and you probably haven't spent more than 10 cumulative minutes in your life looking at software code at all. Which is why you should stop trying to contribute to a discussion that you have absolutely **no** clue about, and let the experts do what they do, whether you understand it or not. You wouldn't try to make architectural suggestions to a construction worker in the process of erecting a building (unless you had a background in architecture), and you wouldn't bumble into a laboratory and fiddle with the scientists' equipment and boss them around (unless you had a background in science), so don't try to tell software devs what they should or should not do when you **clearly** have no background in computer science. It's not appropriate and just makes you look like a total buffoon to anyone who understands the subject of discussion.

I am not confused, and it is obvious you still haven't taken the time to understand what I have said.
Furthermore, effectively every statement you have made has been untrue, as I have politely been pointing out. For example:


1) *Money* is quite arguably "stuff needed by a society" and Bitcoin is arguably the best money yet created. Yet again, your "argument" applies just as well to BTC as it does to anything else, but you are refusing to realize or appreciate this fact.
2) Plenty of stuff "needed by a society" lacks any sort of price floor. Take air, for example. All humans obviously need it, and the market price for atmospheric air is $0.
3) Anything can conceivably drop to zero (human) demand, because we could always go extinct. 


We've covered this: *nothing* does. But you keep skipping over 98% of my comments' contents, so it's not a surprise that you're still stuck on the concepts that have been covered already.


We've been over this, too, and shown it to be obviously false.


Obviously false.


I'm not surprised that you'd reach this conclusion, if you stubbornly cling to your own ignorance whenever you're faced with anyone better-informed than you trying to educate you.
Once again, you haven't actually responded to (or apparently even understood the basics of) anything that I said. If you don't want to have a discussion, there's no need to waste your time hitting "reply" at all. If you *do* want to have a discussion (or simply want to learn more), go back to my first comment and **actually read it**, and then do the same to my subsequent replies. There's no need to respond unless you're *sure* you understand the points that I've made, or alternatively if you need further help to be able to do so.

This looks like it may have been a misunderstanding. When he said "run your own node" he was not referring to running a *mining* node, but rather a *fully-validating* node (or "full node" for short).
In the first couple of years of Bitcoin's existence, the word "node" was used interchangeably to refer to either of these things. The mining functionality was eventually abstracted away from the validation functionality, allowing ASICs designed solely around hyper-efficient double-SHA256 performance to be hooked up to full nodes (which handle all the rest of Bitcoin's network operation). Since then, "node" has generally been used to refer to the non-mining client (which miners, or pools of miners, hook up to).
The advantage of running a node without a miner attached to it is that you're using Bitcoin without having to trust others; you're *validating things for yourself*. It also helps to preserve financial privacy. Pieter Wuille (a legendary Bitcoin developer) offered [a fantastic explanation]( about this, if you're interested in reading more.
The reason why assumed you were being disingenuous is that a small and hostile splinter community of anti-Bitcoin extremists (who unfortunately control both the "btc" subreddit and bitcoindotcom domain name) have been trying to spread the misinformation that "non-mining nodes aren't nodes at all, and (somehow) hurt the Bitcoin network" for years now... this is one of many myths that the Bitcoin community has been working to debunk through grassroots efforts.
Hopefully that helps to clear this up, and hopefully you can see why he might have made the assumption that he did. He was encouraging running a fully validating node and it seemed to him like you were trying to imply that if it wasn't a miner, it wasn't a node.

There's moderation in this subreddit. If you want to claim that moderation is equivalent to censorship, then **every single crypto sub is censored**. In fact, those paying close attention would notice that subreddits like rbtc are moderated/censored in a much more biased, inconsistent, and politically-motivated manner (often removing posts that do not break any rules and banning users likewise). Even has been caught executing similarly-shady censorship; as just one recent example, multiple true and informative (albeit sobering) posts about the Consensys layoffs were made when they happened, and each of them were manually removed by moderators (the majority of whom are directly affiliated with Consensys). Eventually, posts about the same subject with a "positive spin" were approved by the moderators and remained up and visible.
This sort of thing happens all the time, and if you want to accuse *this* subreddit of censorship, you must also realize that almost every other crypto subreddit censors *worse* than this one does. The reason why most of us here don't make such a fuss about it is because unlike altcoins, Bitcoin's success isn't dependent on shit-talking competitors. Bitcoin will succeed (or fail) on its own merits and its community doesn't really need to go out of its way to focus on altcoin subreddit drama.

Bitcoin has been usable since day one.
What Lightning Network *does* create is a *trustless* second layer (note that a second layer already exists, e.g. with Coinbase, where sending from one Coinbase account to another is free and requires no blockchain settlement). This means that for most high-frequency or low-value payments, you should be able to send them through Lightning. Fees-per-transaction on this layer can sustainably remain near-zero.
If we want Bitcoin to remain capped at 21M coins, fees for on-chain confirmation cannot sustainably remain near-zero. But that is totally okay as long as trustless solutions that enable micropayments *do* exist; for fast or cheap payments, use Lightning (or a similar tool); for big and highly-security-conscious payments, go on-chain. The inflation subsidy can dwindle safely and Bitcoin can continue onward.
The block size limit has never actually been a "problem" in Bitcoin; it is a good thing, and we're very lucky that Satoshi was smart enough to put it into the consensus code (and leave it there despite many people trying to convince him to take it out or increase it). With the limit, Satoshi demonstrated his legendary genius and foresight yet again. But even so, we did increase the limit (technically the "block size limit" was removed entirely and replaced with a "block weight limit" when SegWit was activated), so now blocks can contain up to 4 million weight units each (a maximum of about 3.7 MB, though most blocks will probably never get much bigger than 2.3 MB in practice). A limit (especially a limit significantly lower than the constraints imposed by Moore's and Nielsen's respective "Law"s) ensures that Bitcoin can remain decentralized and that the validation of its chain remains affordable by as many people and actors as possible. Scaling Bitcoin was never about "removing size limits" (that's just something stupid people repeat), it has always been about making intelligent trade-offs given the engineering constraints of the blockchain as a data construct.
So, basically, if you think that "1 MB" is a relevant figure in Bitcoin consensus code these days, your assumptions are 9 months out of date... and Lightning Network represents the introduction of a *trustless* second layer (effectively introducing "unicast payments" onto a broadcast paradigm); it's the *opposite* of forcing a new trust model into Bitcoin (and ironically, trying to increase the consensus limits naively *would* be forcing Bitcoin into a new trust-based model and pricing out the ability to exchange value without intermediaries).

Both your post and that post received thousands of upvotes (over 90%).

Those who give Bitcoin value are, by definition, those who **demand** it: anyone who isn't holding coins over significant time-horizons is *not* helping the value of Bitcoin directly.
Other activities, like educating others, building and refining Bitcoin-based tools and services, and participating in economic exchanges using BTC definitely *do* help Bitcoin to grow and prosper *indirectly*, but those who save/hold/hoard coins are the ones who are *directly* giving it value.

But when I disagree with someone (or something they said), or just want to clarify a particular point, I find myself typing up a response before I know it.

The problem is not that he used the "E" word, it's that the Ethereum model is pretty stupid to begin with.

Actually, rbtc deletes comments and submissions *all the time*, often ones that don't even break any subreddit rules, according to the whims of the moderators. They also ban users regularly. I've documented this extensively, and provided proof of it dozens of times over there. They don't like to acknowledge these facts (even with incontrovertible proof staring them in the face), and will inevitably try to change the subject or justify the moderation in inconsistent ways (and of course call me nasty names as they do).
As someone who has spent a lot of time comparing and contrasting the moderation policies of both subreddits, I can say with total sincerity: this place is more consistent and straightforward with the moderation, tagging/flagging/removing things that break the subreddit rules, whereas rbtc seems to be moderated remarkably inconsistently, with removals happening according to the political beliefs of the moderators (often without any explanation) and ad hoc rules enforced selectively depending on how well submissions reinforce or contradict the supported narrative over there.
The myth that they don't delete/ban is just that: a myth. A toxic and trivially-disprovable one, at that.

He dedicates his (considerable) assets towards hurting Bitcoin on a daily basis, and the propaganda which he relentlessly pushes and finances is having a definite (and definitely *negative*) effect on the perception of Bitcoin.
If we are able to counter Ver's efforts with truth, rationality, and *correct* information (to combat the disinformation he puts out) we can hopefully hasten the fade-into-relative-obscurity that the man and his preferred altcoin(s) are destined for.

So much wrong with this question, it's hard to know where to start. I'll give it a whack, though.


"Stagnant" isn't really the word you're looking for; it's not appropriate in the context. You wouldn't say "If the average automobile size in the United States remains stagnant at 190x70 inches..." because there's nothing stagnant about cars being that size on average. A better way to begin your question would be "If the maximum blocksize remains fixed at 1MB..."
Beyond that, "MB" needs to be capitalized to be the proper abbreviation. You might think this is nitpicking, but capitalization actually does mean something with these abbreviations. For instance, "Mb" with the "b" lowercase represents a mega**bit** which is not actually the same as a mega**byte** (capital "B").


Sidechains are not actually a direct scaling solution, though it is entirely reasonable to expect them to help considerably with scaling, as they will allow more flexibility and experimentation upon The Blockchain and allow some data to be offloaded from it. You may have meant to exclude Lightning Network (and other such caching layers or payment channel solutions) from your thought experiment, which **is** a scaling solution (and a superbly elegant one, at that). Or perhaps you meant SegWit, which also helps considerably with scaling (among other things) and raises the max blocksize as a side effect. Incidentally, SegWit is already merged and active on the Testnet and will be merged in the next livenet release (0.13.1) which shouldn't be too far off, at all.
But regardless, it's rather unreasonable to expect either Lightning Network or sidechains (or SegWit) to fail to manifest; there is really no indication that any of these technologies will not come to full fruition and achieve what they were built to achieve. It doesn't make much sense, unless you have information to the contrary, to pretend like such things won't materialize. The specs are already out and peer-reviewed by people much, much smarter than yourself. 
And finally...


No, neither attribute would be affected whatsoever. Bitcoin's portability is entirely independent of the blocksize; I can memorize 12 words and waltz around with my bitcoins effectively stored in my brain, regardless of how large the biggest blocks on the network are. Similarly, I can send you 1.0000001 BTC or send you 1.0000002 BTC regardless of how large the biggest blocks are. The blocks being bigger or smaller wouldn't have any bearing on the divisibility of a bitcoin. It's hard to imagine why you would have that impression to begin with, but I suppose you're just now getting started and aren't really familiar with the terminology of this domain, so it seems most likely that it's just a simple matter of confusion.
@_date: 2019-01-28 16:01:23
Bitcoin has seen more than three major rallies, though. The first two block reward eras each contained more than one bubble.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:19:17


I mean no offense by this, but my impression here is that when you say "thinking about it technically" you aren't actually really doing so. Honestly, how familiar are you with the technical specifics of consensus networks? Do you understand Byzantine Fault Tolerance and the various ways it can be achieved? Are you familiar with the merits of Raft over Paxos? Do you know how zero-knowledge proofs work, and what sort of implications these might have in different contexts (with regards to cryptocurrency as well as other fields)? Do you understand the CAP theorem, and the relevant trade-offs that it implies? Do you understand the FLP impossibility result (and can you summarize it off the top of your head)? How much time have you spent on developer-oriented mailing lists, and how hands-on have you been in terms of open-source development?
Odds are, if any of those questions even slightly intimidate you (or if you have to Google the terms in them in order to even understand what's being asked), you're the victim of a knowledge deficit which precludes you from being able to "think about it technically" when it comes to the nitty-gritty of Bitcoin and how it works, at least on any meaningful level. Suffice it to say, for most people to whom these questions are straightforward and easy-to-answer, they/we see a *lot* of potential in Bitcoin, on a technical level.
I don't say this to be mean. Unfortunately, when it comes to cryptocurrency, everyone tends to assume they're an expert; if you hadn't spent years working on cars and learning how engines work (and how to fix various problems that come up in automobile maintenance), would you go around arguing against mechanics who had spent their lives learning their trade? Of course not (unless you were an ass)... yet that's pretty much the norm in the blockchain space these days. [This meme pretty much sums it up.](


False and false. Transactions in Bitcoin reach "irreversible status" in a matter of minutes to hours; for most "legacy" transactions, this takes days to months. Banks have plenty of use for sound money, just as much as other rational economic actors (e.g. greedy speculators) do. Banks will adjust to accommodate whatever form of money allows them to continue making profits, and while they don't *need* Bitcoin, if that's where the winds are pointing, that's where the (smart) banks will wind up.
Finally, with regards to "transaction speed" (and similarly, ease-of-use or consumer convenience), the reasonable way to accommodate these things is via additional layers; pretty much every complex system or network is engineered this way. Some recommended reading on this topic is [Maxwell's post from 2011]( where he discusses Bitcoin's technical and economic strengths (and weaknesses), and the intelligent means by which we can build on top of this foundation in order to compete against (or supplement, or render obsolete) other financial networks or companies. The blockchain itself is the bottom layer of the stack, and trying to squeeze everything into that particular data-structure is a ridiculous idea that makes no real sense. There are smarter ways to grow than that, and we're just now beginning to flesh these things out.

The Lightning Network is probably the best example of practical, economically useful interlocked smart contracts currently deployed. Tether can be seen as a meta-coin on top of Bitcoin (and frankly doesn't involve any more trust than ERC-based ICO tokens [or even ETH itself] do... which shouldn't be mistaken for serious praise). Similarly, protocols like Liquid, Rootstock, Namecoin, Factom, and Bisq each piggyback on Bitcoin's blockchain, so it "hosts" external contracts, projects, and organizations in various ways. 
If you spend enough time thinking about "examples of useful smart contracts" in general (not just in Bitcoin, but on any ledger), you'll eventually realize that they all boil down to a predicated value transfer. [This is an important insight]( and should be carefully assimilated by anyone who wants a serious understanding of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and the relation between the two.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:06:40
Furthermore, for many truly huge markets and uses, Bitcoin still needs to accumulate roughly one more order-of-magnitude of speculative value before being realistically viable. The biggest global economic players (including but not limited to national governments) might one day be acquiring and holding massive reserves of Bitcoin... or that's the dream, at least: Bitcoin being *the world's money*. But at the moment, it's still relatively small, volatile, illiquid, and manipulable (albeit significantly less so than it was in years past, obviously) and this works to stymie or slow growth and adoption on such scales.
What Bitcoin needs is for people to truly value it. Those who truly value Bitcoin will try to accumulate Bitcoin, obviously, boosting the all-important *demand* side of the supply/demand equation. They will *also* naturally encourage others to value it, too, even if it's simply through others' recognition of their own values (in other words, if I know my friend or neighbor loves Bitcoin, I'll know that I can always pay or give them Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services I need, and thus I will assign it a nonzero or even high value in my personal mental schema). But trying to spend your bitcoins (whether you're buying gift cards to use on Amazon or getting drugs from the Silk Road) isn't actually helping Bitcoin as much as *demanding it yourself* (which includes saving it) does.

If the BCS chain doesn't have replay protection (which is an important property to be aware of when it comes to forks or airdrops), then the signed transactions can be replayed (i.e. reused) on the BTC chain.
Even without replay protection, you wouldn't be able to "tweak" the signature to send the coin to an arbitrary destination address or anything. But yes, signatures can be reused across blockchains which use the same signature algorithm unless there are mechanisms set up explicitly to prevent this from happening.

I'm genuinely impressed with how well he spoke and handled every question as it came. Talented speaker. Also has an impressive resume, it seems.
I'm interested in knowing more about the smart contracts he brought up (and I'm happy to see the smart contracting capabilities of Bitcoin used and highlighted like this). I found [this recent blog post]( which mentions 2-of-2 P2SH multisig contracts being used for "synthetic stablecoins" (with an additional oracle component, ideally in a separate jurisdiction, slated for the nearish future) and I'm even more intrigued. Is there any more info (or code) regarding this service/functionality available?
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:33:02


Perhaps it went over your head...


The discussion is not about "a network that creates barriers of transaction and function between service providers" no matter how many times you try to change the subject (to forks or anything else).


I'll take this as confirmation you do not know what a non sequitur is.
"Non sequitur" is Latin for, basically, "it does not follow" and is used to refer to a type of fallacy in which a conclusion (or response/counterargument) doesn't logically follow from the premises or context in which it is found.
Let's bring back our old friends Alice and Bob, to make sure you get it:
**Alice:** I like dogs, but I don't like cats, because they're so much meaner than dogs. Do you prefer for animals to be mean?
**Bob:** I like the crunchiness of apples more than the squishiness of bananas, so cats are better.
Bob's response was a *non sequitur*. Maybe apples *are* wonderfully crunchy, but they're just not relevant in the cat-versus-dog discussion.


What "segregation" would Schnorr+Coinjoin usage cause? Any block-explorer that didn't display the transactions properly would simply *add more privacy* by doing so (not *strong* privacy or anything, but local obfuscation if nothing else), which would be an advantage. Any wallets that don't support the Schnorrified Coinjoining would simply not be able to participate in the process, and would continue working as they always have. They would still be able to receive payments that were sourced from those who *did* aggregate and mix the sends, and they would show up in their old legacy wallet just like always (just like any legacy wallet can receive a Segwit payment and never even worry about the format the sender used).
There is *no* disadvantage that I can see here, and certainly no segregation that would result from the feature being implemented and used by those who preferred it (whether it was the default for any given wallet or not).


You haven't made any valid observations, you've simply expressed a misunderstanding and failed to realize the insights I'm offering that would allow you to overcome it. You've repeatedly demonstrated your own confusion here while psychologically projecting it to me.
I'm simply doing my best to help you understand what you're missing. Your string of non sequiturs, accusations of malicious misquotations, and misattributions of confusion all boil down to a clumsy defense mechanism against the revelation that you really have been off-the-mark this entire time.

No, from the customer's point of view, the merchant does not have their money, because it's RBF-flagged. That's the whole point of RBF.
The solution is not "yell at the customer like a dimwit", it is "simply send the same transaction back to yourself, and send me one this way"... Or if you're convinced the customer isn't technically capable of doing such a thing, then *the RBF transaction is equivalent to a non-RBF transaction*.

There are a few concepts you will probably want to familiarize yourself with. One, which you already seem to understand, is **Gresham's Law**, which is often summarized as "bad money drives out good" and essentially boils down to the idea that *people would rather spend (get rid of) their "bad" money, rather than their "good" money*. It makes intuitive sense, and for someone who has grown up in an inflationary economic environment, it generally doesn't evoke a sense of worry.
Another concept, the "reverse of Gresham's Law", is **Thier's Law**. To summarize this one: "*if* you factor out unfair legislation favorable to bad money, then good money drives out bad, because who actually *wants* bad money?" This should *also* make intuitive sense, even with your economic upbringing. If you think of it in *micro*economic terms, you should still not feel any sense of unease about this; it is only when you "mentally zoom out" and consider the *macro*economic perspective that you might begin to worry about the implications this might have. I would argue that they're misguided, but nevertheless this is a "normal" reaction.
Finally, there is the concept of **the wealth effect**, which basically boils down to: "people who find themselves significantly wealthier than they were before, tend to *spend* those riches more eagerly". This, too, should make intuitive sense (and in fact it's fairly obvious). Bitcoin's history in particular is full of people celebrating their gains with vacations, new cars, debt-repayments, etc.
Another thing to remember is that *even* if you think that a "100% Bitcoin Economy" would have an adverse effect on net production (or employment, or whatever metric you want to measure "success" by), *from your own personal perspective*, it doesn't really affect whether or not you will adopt or use it; it's much more relevant to you whether or not it makes *you* better off. The same holds true for everyone else, and knowing this, there's a bit of a large-scale Prisoner's Dilemma going on here... *even* assuming Bitcoin's deflation is "a bad thing" on a global scale, it's rational to squirrel some away for yourself anyway. A classic tragedy of the commons situation (the Nash equilibrium is basically "Bitcoin takes over the world").
*But*... I don't believe it *is* a "tragedy" of the commons, at all. Your assumptions about "deflation equals lower spending equals bad" are suspect in a few different ways. I worry this comment is getting too-long as it is, though. It's a subject worth a long ponder, in any case.

Fair point, and well taken. I appreciate the honest response.


Set aside Bitcoin specifically and think in terms of **digital sound money**. Would banks find this useful?
I would argue that *any* rational economic actor, large or small (of which banks are but a subset) would find this valuable and useful, if it is able to prove itself as such.


Bitcoin is optimized to be sound (digital) money. No other major cryptocurrencies have really even tried to "outdo" it in terms of catering to this particular niche (of the other "biggest" cryptocurrencies, as measured by conventional [though I would argue misleading] metrics, the respective foci are on generalized smart contracting, leveraging the Bitcoin brand, fee-minimization, and wholehearted emphasis on privacy, each of which comes with its own set of trade-offs).
Bitcoin has *plenty* to boast over any given altcoin, but a lot of its benefits or advantages are very subtle and require a relatively deep understanding in order to appreciate. As a quick example, the limited expressivity of Bitcoin's Script language is a definite benefit (and very deliberate design choice), whereas it might be tempting to assume that "more is better" in terms of linguistic expressivity (the extreme end of the spectrum being full Turing expressivity). I certainly wouldn't be doing it any justice to try to cram its manifold merits versus each particular alt into a reddit comment, in any case.

Actually, we're already moving in a direction that naturally incentivizes full privacy. There's a synergistic effect that can be achieved by combining Schnorr and CoinJoin; as [Aaron van Wirdum put it](

It fully resolves it. If you believe that you have identified some spooky paradox here, apply it to the Treasuries market; after all, why would anyone ever redeem or trade a T-bill when they could make more money by holding onto it instead?
Or, even *more* simply, imagine it this way: if I offered you a free $20 today, or some magical golden coin which grew in value by $100 every single day, **but which you were never allowed to trade or spend or convert in any way**, which would you take? What if you could trade the golden coin, but only after 800 years had passed?
The coin is worthless. Once you can see why, your "paradox" vanishes.

There is far too much of the disinformation that "Segwit isn't a blocksize increase" and when you say things like this, you're contributing to the problem:


We *did* raise the blocksize limit. Nodes that haven't upgraded to version 0.13.1 or higher (comprising less than 1% of the network) don't "see" this limit increase, but **un-upgraded nodes, by defintion, will *never* be able to see a limit increase**. It doesn't make sense to keep pretending like Segwit wasn't a blocksize limit increase (if it wasn't based on the observed blocksizes by older nodes, then a blocksize limit increase is definitionally impossible), especially when we've seen many blocks greater than 2MB in size on mainnet since it activated.
This isn't "semantics" at all. These are technical parameters which we can speak precisely about. I appreciate that you consider me well-informed and that you've upvoted me over the years, but I don't appreciate that you're helping to perpetuate a false myth that is way past its expiration date.

You're trying to tell me that I am arguing something that I'm not, because you didn't read the conversation carefully.


Yes, and in fact there are plenty of possible and plausible ways that things could play out in which this doesn't happen. They are significantly less likely, in my own estimation (which has proven to be remarkably prescient in the past five years regarding this sector), than the possibilities in which it *does* do so... hence my answer to the initial question.


Anyone can predict the future. No one can *know* it or speak of it with certainty, though. Some are better at predicting it than others, usually because they spend the time to think things through critically and examine all aspects and angles of a subject.

I've argued time and time again that with the notable exception of Overstock, *we haven't actually seen any real merchant adoption of Bitcoin yet*.
If they don't wind up owning BTC after all is said and done, there has not been any actual adoption when companies like Microsoft or Valve """accept""" Bitcoin. In almost every case, they actually accept dollars and have integrated with a Bitcoin-based payment processor. It's not adoption **at all**, it's completely illusory, and doesn't really help Bitcoin in a truly meaningful sense.
Throughout 2014 and 2015, many people were celebrating this sort of illusory "faux merchant adoption", while some of us tried to explain that besides the positive headlines and attention, this isn't really worthy of celebration. If the merchant doesn't introduce actual demand into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the word "adoption" is misleading in reference to them. End of story.
As you've correctly observed, this sort of thing doesn't actually benefit users of Bitcoin or really strengthen the network itself; it benefits payment processors and miners (the closest thing to "middlemen" that Bitcoin has).

For those who aren't already aware: Roger Ver is a serial liar. A while ago I compiled together a [non-comprehensive list of examples of his lies]( which included things like claiming to be banned from a subreddit he wasn't actually banned in (and then accidentally posting in it), egregiously misrepresenting his trial (which has a public court transcript available to contrast against), the infamous case where he vouched for Mt.Gox shortly before it imploded, and actions/policies he has taken with regards to the website(s) he controls.
In a classic case of psychological projection, Roger Ver told [a string of lies]( while accusing Aaron van Wirdum of being a liar.
As you can see from the thread above, Roger is often presented information which he deliberately chooses to ignore or suppress. Another excellent example of this is the case where [a single user went out of their way to vandalize a subreddit]( (which was repeatedly explained to Roger), and then Roger tried to [misrepresent the episode anyway]( Yet another example of this is when Roger [flagrantly misrepresented history]( and was promptly made aware of how disingenous his depiction was, only to record [a video two days later which repeated (and doubled down on) the very same lie]( (as well as making more untruthful statements). Note that Roger conspicuously refuses to respond to or acknowledge the facts of the matter when they are brought to his attention; [here's another example of him doing the same thing after making an unsubstantiated claim]( (on a related note, if you were wondering what I was referring to in the first paragraph of the previous link, see [here]( this well-documented political overmoderation/censorship of rbtc is another subject I've been trying to ask Roger about and only ever get crickets in response).
On a more "silly" and "minor" note, he likes to make misleading post titles like "[What I (Roger Ver) think about OP_GROUP]( without actually saying what he thinks about the proposal (instead engaging in a blatant bait-and-switch where he goes on to make more lies about how their community has "free and open discussion" despite the fact that this is false; see the preceding paragraph to get a fuller picture and appreciation of this). On an unrelated-to-crypto note, he has gone out of his way to [defend dogfighting]( which isn't "dishonest" per se, but is reprehensible in another way.
He frequently makes directly-contradictory statements, like when he said ["I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC" and then two weeks later said "I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash."]( Note that even when he makes statements like this (which *cannot* both be true) he will sometimes try to retroactively qualify one or the other in an attempt at further deception; this represents [more lying]( In the same vein, his mining pool [signals support for BIPs that it doesn't enforce](
He repeatedly pushes the false (and destructively misleading) propaganda that "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash"; not only will he resort to [extremely childish images]( in the name of this cause (and [repeat the tactic like a broken record]( but [effectively sponsors it on the bitcoin(dot)com website and the rbtc subreddit (both of which he controls)]( to put the icing on the cake, the website was involved in [a "bitter dispute" between Ver and OKCoin which resulted from Ver's "suspicious activity"]( and [he most likely bought the subreddit in an under-the-table deal in direct violation of reddit's Terms-of-Service](
There are other times where his lies and misrepresentations are more subtle. [Take this post]( for instance; not only is he purposefully misconstruing a quote (which he apparently doesn't even understand the underlying logic of) and pretending that it is referencing an asset *which didn't even exist at the time*, but in the image/slide Roger created, he includes a screenshot of a **BitPay service fee** as if it is a **Bitcoin network fee** during a time period in which Bitcoin transactions using *1 cent fees* were being processed. It's almost impressive *how much* duplicity Roger was able to cram into a single slide.
Another ridiculous misrepresentation he tried to get away with was the time where he mocked Andreas Antonopoulos on Twitter, and then had the gall to [later claim he "made Andreas a millionaire"]( essentially trying to take personal credit for the donations that the community (and especially  provided.
He will [relentlessly promote the known scammer Craig Wright]( promoting links like [this one]( (where it is claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi and has possession of Satoshi's private keys) while saying things like ["In regards to me saying that Craig Wright is Satoshi, uh, **I have never said that publicly**"]( 
As part of his propaganda campaign, he'll shamelessly repeat untrue headlines like ["Bitcoin cash is surging as other cryptocurrencies fall"]( when the reality of the situation is that [most of the time, exchanging your BCH for BTC would have been far more profitable than not doing so]( and this has proven more and more true as time has gone on (another fact Roger refuses to ever concede).
He will [reference fake projects]( (which [do not exist, and represent nothing more than misinformation for trolls to parrot]( and gets [*extremely* emotional and irrationally upset]( when people use the phrase "bcash" to refer to BCH (despite being willing to repeatedly and aggressively misrepresent "Bitcoin" as "Bitcoin Core", even though the former is a network and asset and the latter is a software client and node implementation). Note that the video link just provided includes Roger Ver "rage quitting" from the interview with the quote: "I've never hired a single sockpuppet" which [has now been proven to be *another* false statement](
A long time ago, he also [abused his admin rights on blockchain(dot)info to dox (and fully publish) a user's information]( over a *$50 dispute* which was the result of *Roger accidentally sending the user BTC* and which had *nothing to do with blockchain(dot)info in the first place*. When the community lambasted him for this (obviously unethical) behavior, he locked and edited the thread to try to cover it up and sweep it under the rug. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for Roger's reputation), the incident is archived.
This isn't a comprehensive breakdown, either. [Others have compiled]( similar [histories]( of [Roger Ver lying]( and even *those* don't cover everything. There are tons of other examples where Roger Ver showed the world his true colors, and **they are ugly**.

You originally said: "What about when a wallet defaults to segwit transactions, and an exchange doesn't support **receiving** them? This was a common problem"... that is false. Once again, after I have pointed out that you were incorrect (and explained exactly why and how), you have changed the subject.
To (yet again) bring this back to the relevant point at hand: the impetus for this discussion was about a hypothetical wallet implementation making Schnorr+Coinjoin the default option for **sending outgoing transactions**. The receiving wallet or service doesn't have to know or care *how* the transaction was *sent*, as long as it receives the coins/UTXOs successfully. As such, *there is no potential for "segregation" introduced by the proposal above*, which I have pointed out numerous times (and highlighted via bolding the text that explains this, repeatedly reminding you to pay attention to it because it is the primary point being made which is clearly escaping you).

Many of us recognize that Bitcoin is still very much in its early stages of growth. Getting excited about the Internet and the impact it would eventually have on society back in 1991 when sending an email was a nightmare of an experience for the average user would earn you the same dismissal: "I think many of you are overestimating how much people care about the Internet." Most of us aren't looking so much at where the ball *is*, but rather where it is heading.
Furthermore, I don't think you're justified in your basic argument, anyway. National governments are enacting fresh legislation regularly explicitly in response to the growth of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Some are banning it outright (though usually these bans are revoked a year or two after they are enacted) while others are taking more measured approaches, but *none* of these countries are taking the stance that "this is no big deal" any more. The universally-recognized truth at this point, *even at the top levels of state*, is that "crypto is here to stay" and governments are beginning to take it much more seriously than you are trying to pretend.
In terms of banks, we've seen plenty of evidence that they, too, are organizing responses to the (by now obvious) shift that Bitcoin represents. From Jamie Dimon going out of his way on multiple separate occasions to try to smear it (while Chase applied for hundreds of cryptocurrency-related patents in the background), to the R3 coalition of 37 top-tier banks from around the world pouring millions of dollars into a think-tank to try to build a "Bitcoin-killer", at this point trying to argue that banks (and other legacy financial institutions) are *not* taking this seriously and dedicating time and resources towards "handling" it in one way or another is simply lying to yourself.
A couple of years ago, you might have been able to seem like you had a much stronger point. By now, it's obvious that you don't. Banks, governments, and big corporate interests are all recognizing Bitcoin and the potential that cryptocurrency represents (both as a possible threat and as a possible opportunity). You're kidding yourself if you tell yourself otherwise.
Feel free to pat yourself on the back and pretend like everyone here is a tinfoil nutter if that's the only way you can keep up your self-esteem, but Bitcoin is definitely turning some heads at this point, like it or not.

I'm personally not aware of any legitimate "competitors" to Bitcoin that weren't around during the last bear market; the biggest and "hottest" altcoins (Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, IOTA, Nano, Ripple, etc) have all been around for years at this point. And to be frank, none of them really hold a candle to Bitcoin in the "sound money" niche (which is, ultimately, the value-driver of this revolution and growth, whether the masses have realized this yet or not).

That's right. It is peer-to-peer electronic cash, and always has been. 
Electronic/digital cash is a [term of art]( in cryptography, which can be traced back to [Chaum](
Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer** implementation of e-cash. Its distinguishing property being that it is fundamentally decentralized, and that anyone is free to run a node themselves in order to participate in the network without going through trusted third parties or intermediaries. The proper emphasis should therefore be: "Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"


1) Transaction times have nothing to do with the definition of "electronic cash" whatsoever.
2) Block times remain the same old ten-minute-average that Satoshi originally designed them to be.


Satoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining in the Bitcoin whitepaper itself:


This was not the only time [he likened Bitcoin to gold]( either. He also described Bitcoin as "an implementation of the bit gold idea" and he clearly thought that Bitcoin should and would be treated as an investment, saying: "It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."

It's because it *is* a realized gain at that point. You no longer have ownership of the coins after you've sold them (converted them to fiat). Whether or not you've actually transmitted that fiat to other account(s) that you control is irrelevant for the purposes of evaluating a cost basis or calculating taxes owed.
Hypothetically, if the price dropped significantly immediately after you sold, and you bought back in moments afterwards, you would have an entirely new cost basis for the coins you just (re)acquired.
Really, the only way to make sure all the math works out consistently is to consider conversions (even those that only ever happen within an exchange) realized gains or losses.
Not that it's fun to hear this while you're still feeling your tax wounds. Sorry.

...what? What purpose? My entire point was that *only negativity and toxicity resulted* from those logs. Are you trying to argue that open mod logs are a bad thing, and using my anecdotes as support for this?


Which account was that? Far more often than not, the users who go to rbtc to brag about having been banned from here are deliberately misrepresenting the situation; they often make multiple (deceptive, shilling, trolling, etc) comments that wind up earning them a ban, then choose the *least* offensive one and pretend like that was the impetus. Many times, they'll even go so far as to *delete* the other (worse) comments to try to hide their tracks and dispose of the evidence. Many of us have started making web archive links when banning such users, just in case they pull these sorts of shenanigans, because of how remarkably common of a phenomenon this is.
A good rule of thumb, which holds true far more often than not, is that if your information is from rbtc, it's probably false or deceptive.


This is **absolutely false**. As someone who has personally flagged and removed *hundreds* of Litecoin-promoting posts and comments from this subreddit, I can tell you for a fact that you are lying to me right now.
You're being shamelessly dishonest and looking more and more like a troll with every lie you tell.


That right there speaks volumes.


If lying trolls being banned from some subreddit somehow discourages you from evaluating different cryptocurrencies on their respective technical merits, you're either a troll or an idiot.

Great question, which unfortunately we don't know the answer to just yet. It's hard for me to imagine that stripping away the fundamental value-add from the whole blockchain breakthrough will still manage to realistically compete with a "true solution" like Bitcoin (over the long term), but perhaps I'm too much of a purist, or too optimistic, or *something.*
So far, nothing has come close to meaningfully challenging Bitcoin on actual technological merit (at least in my opinion), but who knows? Maybe some sort of corner-cutting approach ends up "crossing the chasm" in a way that Bitcoin never does, by trading off (compromising) in just the right way and managing to appeal to the masses at large in a way that Bitcoin never does. I certainly hope not (the story is *so much cooler* if Bitcoin wins out), but perhaps that's how it will go.

The benefit of soft forks is backwards compatibility and the continuation of network consensus.
The above example is intended to demonstrate that pretty much any change is possible to implement as a soft fork. As I said, this specific change is not something that I actually think would be beneficial to do.


This is backwards, the question should be: *Why hard fork?*
The only reason to try to coordinate a hard fork update is if there is an uncontroversial upgrade proposal that requires a backwards\-incompatible change \(or is significantly superior if implemented in a backwards\-incompatible way\). So far, no such proposals exist, and in fact there haven't been any quality hard fork proposals \(much less uncontroversial ones\) made in many years. Rapidly changing the proof\-of\-work algorithm is pretty much the only thing that jumps to mind as something that we would need a hard fork for, but I don't think this is something that will be achieving social consensus any time soon \(at least not without some sort of emergency situation arising\).

No one has answered you correctly, so here is the answer: **selfish mining**.
You can Google that phrase to find a paper on the subject, which is worth reading (even if one of the primary authors and contributors to the paper is a bit of an egomaniacal troll who tries to dress up his "findings" as if they are ultimate truths beyond dispute and wrap them up in misleading, alarmist headlines).
The basic idea is thus: with a third (or more) of the total network hashrate under the control of a single entity or coalition (henceforth called The Pool), Bitcoin faces an issue. The Pool is able to *withhold* the blocks that they mine, communicating them *internally* amongst themselves but *not* externally (to the rest of the network) until an alternative candidate block at the same height is received. Half the time, when this happens, the pool will lose the "race" and the alternative block will be accepted by the rest of the network, instead of their own. However, the other half of the time, their block will "win the race" and orphan the other block.
This might not seem like a scary attack vector at first glance, because they lose half of these blocks they withhold (and the profits that they might have gotten from them), but there is *another* element that makes it problematic. Because The Pool has a tiny little edge on the rest of the network when it comes to these withheld blocks (as they are able to start mining on top of them while the rest of the network is still mining at a slightly lower blockheight), they will actually be able to win the race *slightly* more often than half of the time; every now and then, they will get a *second* or *third* block mined on top of their own candidate block, and thereby orphan the alternative branch in the process. Over time, this slight advantage will manifest as higher profitability relative to "enemy" pools and miners, and there will be a natural incentive for other miners to join The Pool in order to benefit from this phenomenon (rather than continually bleeding out potential profits to these orphaned blocks). This could theoretically cause The Pool to build momentum and absorb the other miners on the network, making the above advantage more pronounced, worsening the situation, and strengthening The Pool's cartel until it evolves into a sort of mining monopoly (with more than 51% of the hashrate under its control, thereby gaining the power to double spend at will and undermining Bitcoin in the process).
That's the basic idea of the selfish mining attack, and though there are quite a few flaws with the idea and its not as inevitable, scary, or apocalyptic as the authors who originally presented it might try to argue or pretend, it is indeed an attack vector worth being aware of, and worth remembering. Mining centralization is not something to dismiss as "nothing to worry about" in Bitcoin.

False, because as correctly pointed out, that is impossible.
The Silk Road came *after* bitcoins had acquired a non-zero value (by, you guessed it: *speculators*!)... otherwise, no one would have been willing to exchange perfectly good drugs for BTC.
Furthermore, for many truly huge markets and uses, Bitcoin still needs to accumulate roughly one more order-of-magnitude of speculative value before being realistically viable.
Those who give Bitcoin value are, by definition, those who **demand** it: anyone who isn't holding coins over significant time-horizons is *not* helping the value of Bitcoin directly.
Other activities, like educating others, building and refining Bitcoin-based tools and services, and participating in economic exchanges using BTC definitely *do* help Bitcoin to grow and prosper *indirectly*, but those who save/hold/hoard coins are the ones who are *directly* giving it value.
The ["I'm Hoarding Bitcoins, and No You Can't Have Any"]( essay is a classic and a must-read on the subject.

No, I'm explaining something you misunderstand.


No, that's another misunderstanding, and that's what we're trying to help with. There is only **one** Bitcoin, and then there are thousands of *altcoins* (which are entirely separate from Bitcoin, regardless of what they try to pretend with misleading branding). Some of those altcoins (like CLAMS or Bitcoin Gold) airdropped their initial supply to holders of Bitcoin, as a means to "bootstrap their network" and give it an initial base of users right as the altcoin was created. BCH is an example of one of these airdropped altcoins.
However, none of these are actually "different flavours of Bitcoin" (and that doesn't even make sense). That would be like saying "Vimeo is a different flavour of YouTube"... no, Vimeo is a separate site altogether. It might do something similar to YouTube (serve webpages with videos in them), but it is *not* YouTube, just like BTG and BCH are not Bitcoin.


No, putting the word "Bitcoin" in an altcoin's name does not make the word "Bitcoin" an "umbrella term" all of a sudden. There is only one Bitcoin protocol, and only one Bitcoin currency.


There is: **Bitcoin** or **BTC**. 
The "doubt" that you're talking about is just confusion which is a result of a misleading propaganda campaign run by enemies of Bitcoin who are trying to pump specific altcoins. Again, there is only one Bitcoin, and it has the ticker BTC. The way we clear up doubt and confusion is by calmly explaining this fact to people who don't already realize it, such as yourself. Even if we *were* silly enough to tag on something on the end, like "Bitcoin Original", one of the propagandists could just launch "Bitcoin Original Cash" and recreate the same exact problem. It regresses infinitely.


Bitcoin Core is a software client. It means something already. That is why it is a popular term. You can't say "Let's call airplanes bicycles because 'bicycle' is a popular term already" because these words already mean things and have established definitions.


You're not getting this. It's memorable and *refers to a software client*. It says something very specific.

It's much worse than it looks, too, because BTC.com is owned by Bitmain (they openly acknowledge and admit this, it's not a conspiracy theory), who also openly own AntPool and ConnectBTC. This adds up to over 40% of the hashrate we see, and [that's just a fraction of what they probably *actually* control](
Bitmain's hegemony is an ugly wart of Bitcoin's right now. It remains to be seen how much an effect this ultimately has.

TL;DR: overt ASICBoost avoids pretty much all the downsides associated with the tech, but uses up two version-signaling bytes (meaning that less soft-fork upgrades can be signaled for simultaneously).
That isn't really much of an issue, if you ask me. So overt ASICBoost seems like something to be welcomed or celebrated.

The misunderstanding is on your end, actually. The 21M coin limit, for instance, was never specified in the whitepaper or in any sort of formal specification *other* than the actual code implementation built by Satoshi. Nevertheless, everyone agrees this is a fairly critical component in that which we define as *Bitcoin*. As Satoshi said: 


Distributed consensus protocols are notoriously unforgiving; fiddle with them even slightly and all the proofs you thought you could rely on are out the window. Try implementing Raft (or even worse, Paxos) from scratch sometime, and you'll come away with a much richer understanding of this fact. There are a thousand (seemingly tiny and insignificant) details that you have to get *exactly* right, and if you cut any corners or tweak basically *anything* along the way, congratulations: you broke it.
Bitcoin is a distributed consensus protocol, and the specification thereof happens to be the implementation itself. Perhaps a formal spec, laid out by Satoshi, would have been a better approach, but that's not what he went with. He pretty much doubled-down on the "the code is the spec" philosophy when he wrote:


If you want to build your own separate cryptocurrency protocol with a different approach, you're free to... but those of us who decided to join in on Satoshi's wild ride for the long haul, and got on board with *Bitcoin*, will continue forward with his vision and see where it takes us.

The Lightning Network is remarkably tricky to properly understand on a conceptual level; I've had to read the original whitepaper multiple times (often needing to set it aside for an hour or two to digest specific sections) in order to get a decent grasp of even the basics of the model. This is relatively rare; usually I find myself understanding the bulk of a whitepaper on the first read-through, at least when it comes to modern "cryptocurrency-project whitepapers", which seem to usually be more high-level and simplistic than other types of whitepapers.
On top of that, the Lightning Network has evolved considerably since the initial whitepaper was published. As more teams got involved and the client implementations progressed towards a reality, improvements (and with them, added complexity) have been introduced.
I've done my best to keep up-to-date with developments as they come, and definitely have a decent understanding of the basics... but I wouldn't say that I deserve the "Lightning Network Expert" flair or anything like that.
I've written a little bit of code that is related to the Lightning Network, though I haven't personally submitted any PRs to any of the client implementations that you would have heard of. So the answer to both of your questions is basically the same: "A bit."

The Super Hard Fork is otherwise known as a "network partition" and it's a real issue to think about, considering how much hashpower is geographically located in China.
Blockstream have deployed a [relay satellite]( which offers some emergency redundancy for such situations. Other than solutions like that, an attacker who is able to relay transactions on each half of the partition is indeed able to issue conflicting (double-spending) transactions. When the partition is resolved and the network is reconnected, the shorter branch (the half which didn't accumulate as much proof of work) is orphaned, and any transactions that were included in this branch but not included in the longer one are reversed and it would be as if they had never happened.
Of course, if a significant portion of the hashrate disappeared suddenly like that, we'd notice (block generation would slow down appreciably) and anyone paying a little bit of attention would probably hear about the issue and be warned not to trust transactions (especially if they were on the smaller half of the network) as they normally would.
For the "Different kinds of forks" (i.e. the "airdrop a new coin with a purposefully weak signature algorithm" attack), first note that SHA is not a signature algorithm, it's a hashing algorithm. ECDSA is the standard signature algorithm used in Bitcoin. In any case, if you release a new coin with new code/software designed to leak users' private keys and then successfully trick users into using this software, yes, you get their private keys. Note that you don't actually need a new coin or blockchain for this; if you get a user to run compromised software with access to their private keys, you get those keys. You don't need to swap out signature algorithms for this.
That's why there is such an emphasis placed on being careful what binaries and executables you run, especially on machines with access to private keys. In fact, for large amounts, you should be generating and storing those keys securely anyway, and not importing them into any location, machine, software, or service without first emptying them of their balances.
We can't entirely prevent users from making mistakes; all we can do is provide warnings and information where possible. Security isn't easy.

My comment didn't contain any "nonsensical rhetoric" whatsoever. I directly addressed everything that you said, with relevant and truthful information.


Nope. I haven't watched (nor read or otherwise consumed) more than twenty seconds' worth of Jordan Peterson's output. The extent of my Jordan Peterson knowledge is that he's a controversial psychologist.
Nice attempt at changing the subject, I guess?


1) Bitcoin doesn't cost much to transfer, at all, even if we're limiting our discussion exclusively to on-chain sends. You can get your transaction confirmed in the very next block most of the time for a cent or two.
2) There is more to Bitcoin than the bottom layer of the stack. With networked HTLCs, we've implemented Satoshi's high-frequency-trading approach, allowing *sub-satoshi payments* to be sent and processed, *more* privately than standard payments outside of channels, in a matter of *milliseconds*, without even requiring added reliance on trusted third parties! To ignore the ever-growing Lightning Network is beyond disingenuous at this point.
3) Bitcoin is still "working properly" even if it *does* cost exorbitant fees to transfer coins. In fact, **the only way** that sustained high-fee-rates is possible is if Bitcoin is wildly, wildly successful and the demand for its usage is at extremely high levels for significant durations of time. As Bitcoin was *designed from the beginning* to rely upon transfer fees for long-term chain security, this hypothetical scenario would represent a resounding and unambiguous success.
4) People can use Bitcoin however they want. Holding it as a speculative asset is a totally valid use-case (and arguably the most rational use-case at this stage in Bitcoin's life).


Repeating a false statement multiple times doesn't suddenly make it true. Bitcoin is for anyone who wants to use it, however they want to use it.


Well, setting aside the fact that this is just an opinion and not any sort of official "mission statement of Bitcoin", it's worth noting that Bitcoin *does* empower the poor (at least, those with the prerequisite opportunity to even interface with the network). It *also* empowers the rich (arguably to a lesser degree). It is an open system where anyone can participate if they want, and if you're going to get upset that wealthy users can make use of it just as much as less-wealthy users can, you're going to have a bad time.


It sounds like you're just highly ignorant of the reality of the situation. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, though.
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:25:09
Well, I have some good news for you: all the reasons you dislike/discount Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are simply misunderstandings.
Bitcoin hasn't split, and its scarcity has remained sacrosanct. The creation of counterfeit bitcoins (which can be easily cryptographically verified as counterfeit by anyone with a basic, functional level of knowledge) doesn't inflate the Bitcoin supply whatsoever, and as always, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in total. The airdrops that have occurred in the past few years (like BTG, BTD, BCH, etc) have essentially represented "stock dividends" that can be converted into real bitcoins by the holders interested in maximizing their Bitcoin portfolios; I personally made significant profits from such airdrops, and am grateful that they occurred. This is another great demonstration of the network effect and one of the many benefits of Bitcoin as a Schelling point of this new frontier.
In reality, Bitcoin is very **hard** to fork ("fork" in this sense referring to chain fork rather than repo fork), but comparatively easy to clone or "spin off" from. Such a spin-off launch strategy has the obvious appeal of gaming the "market cap" metric that is referenced in cryptocurrency (which is one of many ways that the metric can be gamed and helps to show why it is such a misleading metric to begin with), but fortunately it doesn't dilute the supply or value of *actual* bitcoins whatsoever. On the contrary, such spin-off launches provide yet another incentive for users to maximize their stake in Bitcoin!
With regards to the Lightning Network, I am happy to inform you that your fundamental premise is once again entirely without substance. The Lightning Network is and has been fully functional and working great for many months now. Even better, it achieves this with an *actual security model* at the base layer which is optimized to be sound money and decentralized in terms of governance, something that can (at least currently) only really be said of Bitcoin proper.


Oh, there are *plenty* of examples of this happening throughout history, but fortunately they're not relevant in this particular case, because as I've explained, Bitcoin is the superior product here, and the more you learn and understand the clearer this becomes. Since you seem fairly intelligent and thoughtful (if a bit uninformed at present) I'd be happy to answer any specific questions that you might have about any of this, but I do feel I should reiterate: if you have specific coins you'd like to discuss that *aren't* Bitcoin (and if whatever you want to say can be reasonably construed as "promotion"), it'd be best if we continue that particular conversation somewhere that it's actually appropriate.


Oh no, that's definitely not the root of the issue here (or at least, it doesn't seem to be from my understanding of what you're "looking for"). The bigger issue is the knowledge differential here; without intending any disrespect whatsoever, many of your assumptions and beliefs about Bitcoin and the layers atop it are just misunderstandings and demonstrably, verifiably incorrect. It's not even necessarily your fault, either, because there's a **lot** of misinformation out there, for obvious (financially-motivated) reasons. The number one takeaway that I hope you recognize is the need to start verifying facts firsthand rather than believing what others tell you: *Don't trust, verify.*

You can disagree with Satoshi all you want, but at least be honest about the fact that you are doing so. The whitepaper talks explicitly about using fraud proofs and alerts for SPV security, and then goes on to say, "Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification." Or is the BCH approach supposed to be "Don't worry, no businesses will ever receive frequent payments"?
Furthermore, it's hard to pretend that an attack vector requiring a single entity to control &gt;50% hashrate is dismissable because *Bitmain already has this*.
For anyone actually interested in learning more about SPV and its limitations, see [Lopp's excellent write-up]( The user I'm replying to is here to try to troll and subtly shill altcoins, so this link is intended for anyone else out there actually interested in learning more.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:35:27


No, not at all. I never said anything even remotely resembling that. You should do your own research and more importantly do your own critical thinking, and you should identify those who reason thoroughly and accurately and are vindicated by reality, and you should continue to ask questions and learn from anyone who you judge to know more than you.


Right, you can go through and list the specific individual trade-offs that any given coin made relative to Bitcoin (and in fact I'm telling you outright that I've personally done so), but as you've correctly observed, digital scarcity can potentially be strongly assured with **Bitcoin** but not **cryptocurrency**.


Yes, aside from the many low-level architectural advantages that Bitcoin enjoys, it has the multi-sided network effect in its favor, it (uniquely) boasts true leaderlessness, and it represents the Schelling point of the new digital monetary frontier. That's exactly right.


That's correct, of course. That's why we each need to *continually* assess and reassess our own assumptions and conclusions as the future unfolds.


You're certainly free to think that, but of course, the "some unspecified coin will probably overthrow Bitcoin" argument lacks any weight without substantiation or elaboration as to the specifics of the rationale. Since this isn't the appropriate subreddit to try to promote altcoins in, if you'd like to discuss the specifics of any particular project/network/token feel free to message me privately and I'd be happy to swap thoughts with you. If your argument is more general, a la "at some point *something* will out-innovate Bitcoin" then it's trivially dismissable on a prima facie basis, just like an unconsidered "Bitcoin will fail because digital tokens are dumb" stance would be.


You don't need to run a node to transact on/with/in the Lightning Network. It's possible (actually likely) that you've been misinformed by reading fallacious negative propaganda regarding the Lightning Network, judging from this apparent misconception and the prevalence of such propaganda, much of which originates from convincing-sounding Bitcoin-related domains/namespaces (e.g. the dotcom website, the  twitter handle, and the rbtc subreddit) that are unfortunately not actually Bitcoin portals/resources at all.


That's fine, but so far you haven't actually provided any arguments to substantiate this "claim" (perhaps more accurately described as a "hunch") and furthermore, you are new to the world of cryptocurrency and have no demonstrable track record of correct predictions or reasoning which might confer respect from those of us that do. Over the years, I've watched hundreds of users delete their own accounts out of shame after suffering the embarrassments of reality; I'm happy to hear your arguments out and answer any questions you have, but your personal assessment doesn't mean much to me until you've demonstrated the capacity for critical insight.

There are a **lot** of red flags on this post. It looks like a concern troll trying slightly harder to disguise their intent than we're used to.
The "let's start with a disclaimer" bit is a tiny bit strange. The post basically starts by saying "Don't worry, I'm on 'your side', even though it might not seem like it and you haven't ever seen me before!" Suspicious right out of the gate.
They go on to say "I looked at lnd and found out it requires btcd"... *which isn't true at all*. In fact lnd works fine with Core; the OP either didn't actually spend more than 10 seconds looking into this, or is trying to deceive. Either way, red flag.
Then we get to the "C is very bad, why not Rust?" bit... [just a couple days after Peter Todd tweeted this]( OP mentions that they were aware of this tweet, too... again, this sounds like a concern troll trying to parrot a particular talking point. In the comments that question this point, OP doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject (seems more like they're trying to "fake their way through it"), making it seem even more likely that they're not actually offering an opinion of their own, but actually just repeating something they saw a knowledgeable developer tweet and then trying to pass it off as a personal insight. Notice that they aren't able to suggest any *other* languages that would have satisfied them... just the one that Peter Todd mentioned explicitly.
They mention a few things like "those nodes I connected to put 0 satoshis into the channel, so they wouldn't be able to receive my payment" and "routing was giving 'too expensive' error even for 5% fees" which are further red flags...
And then we get to the comments, where they say a bunch of ridiculous things like "[C is obsolete]( (what a ridiculous and obviously-false statement), "[this is the point for small blockers]( (I have never seen anyone *except* for rbtc trolls ever use the phrase "small blockers") and "[Ouch.]( in response to someone saying they had set up and used LN on mainnet *with no issues whatsoever*. That's not an appropriate or even relevant response, that's something a troll would say.
To top it all off, [they don't even have any crash reports to offer]( how *convenient* that the dog ate their digital homework here.
This is a long string of red flags, and I see that it's being brigaded by anti-Bitcoin subreddits as I type this. I try to give the benefit of the doubt when possible, but in this case, there's very little doubt to give the benefit of.

Alright. [Here]( your comment said: "Weird how you failed to quote the one thing that explains what you're missing but managed to quote everything else. Selective reading? **What happens if some providers choose not to support the features of a given soft fork for whatever reasons they have?**" Ironically enough, that was *all* you said there, despite the fact that the comment you were responding to made multiple separate points (most of which you still haven't quite grasped) and asked you direct questions which have remained unanswered. In other words, this is another clear example of you projecting (accusing me of "selective reading" and skipping over relevant sections of the comment I replied to, when in fact I had not done so and *you* were presently guilty of that very activity).


This is *another* non sequitur. No one has said any of my ideas are bad here. This is roughly the equivalent of Bob asking Alice "Do you always spin in circles when you see a rainbow overhead?" in the middle of their cats-and-dogs conversation.


Please read the rest of the paragraph following the question you just tried to answer. Here, I'll quote it for you: **Any block-explorer that didn't display the transactions properly would simply add more privacy by doing so (not strong privacy or anything, but local obfuscation if nothing else), which would be an advantage. Any wallets that don't support the Schnorrified Coinjoining would simply not be able to participate in the process, and would continue working as they always have. They would still be able to receive payments that were sourced from those who did aggregate and mix the sends, and they would show up in their old legacy wallet just like always (just like any legacy wallet can receive a Segwit payment and never even worry about the format the sender used).** The next paragraph is salient here, too: **There is no disadvantage that I can see here, and certainly no segregation that would result from the feature being implemented and used by those who preferred it (whether it was the default for any given wallet or not).**
You must have forgotten to read that part, considering how off-the-mark your attempt at answering the question was.


It is, indeed. I'm trying to simplify things for you, but you're quite emotional and not able to see reason, it seems.


I've been pinpointing your fallacious reasoning and calmly explaining exactly where you're wrong (and why), in simple terms, from the beginning. If you want something "more constructive" than that, and aren't able to acknowledge or appreciate anything that I'm telling you (despite the child-friendly simplifications and presentations I'm offering), then there may indeed be little point in trying to continue.


Actually, it was you who brought up network forks, as my link above shows. Furthermore, you did so while ignoring pretty much the entirety of the comment(s) you were replying to at the time, effectively trying to achieve a total change of subject to nothing *but* network forks, and from there you continually tried to shoehorn the gradual adoption of Segwit (a soft fork) by various services in the ecosystem into the conversation, despite its lack of relevance in the present context. As I patiently explained *why* this was irrelevant, you grew more and more illogical and defensive, to the point where you're now pretending like I brought up network forks and basically living in an angry and bitter fantasy world.
Take a few deep breaths, count backwards from ten, and try to get a grip on your emotions. Once you've cooled off, read the paragraph(s) you shut out the first time (which have been pasted again in this comment, and bolded for emphasis). You just might have a "eureka" moment.

Bitcoin maximalism was never "needed", it's just the natural conclusion that a serious amount of critical and well-informed thought will lead to.

The verb "reinstate" is a bit misleading here. It's arguable whether crypto-to-crypto trades *ever* qualified as like-kind transactions (and a much, much stronger case can be made that they never have). I don't have high hopes for this particular initiative, and you should certainly be very up-front about the fact that **crypto-to-crypto trades are currently taxed (in the United States) and should be accounted for accordingly**.


Again, I'm not very optimistic about your chances here.


Not necessarily; only if the asset has appreciated in value since acquisition.


This isn't phrased very well... "market cap" is a bogus metric in cryptocurrency, easily games and highly misleading. We want cryptocurrency's tremendous *potential* to benefit the economy, but the "market cap" (and especially the cumulative one) isn't really a meaningful part of that.
All in all, I might sound pessimistic here, but it sounds like you're trying to bite off more than you can chew.

An interesting point. If we're looking for a maximally level playing field in the mining sector, wouldn't we want to strive for *all* patents to be opened up for universal use? If anything, it seems like we would *especially* want to work towards distributing access to those which are controlled or owned by entities wielding significant patent-based leverage.


It seems like changes to the protocol which serve to level the playing field by introducing added resistance to mining monopolization should be *exactly* the sort of upgrades we would most want to make. It doesn't matter who holds (or is trying to gain) the monopoly; if we can maximize decentralization with an update (or in this case, by *opposing* an update that could potentially be activated unilaterally by a particular conglomerate) then that has merit in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:38:02


It doesn't. You yourself just admitted this.
Now, of course, you're moving the goalposts in a textbook "No True Scotsman" moment: signaling suddenly indicates intent to run code when *a majority* of miners are signaling a certain way, otherwise it's meaningless.
You want to know the best part? *We know that this is wrong, too!* You see, there have been quite a few times where a majority of miners were "signaling EC support", and yet almost every one of them never actually bothered running the code or trying to fork (with the hilarious exception of Roger Ver, *on accident*).
EC code was both available *and* had the "support" of the majority of miners at the time... and yet here we are, SegWit activated and still running Bitcoin.

It's not solely a matter of "how many nodes exist right now"; alas, if only things were so simple.
You can develop a better mental framework by [reading this]( and earnestly reflecting on the ideas therein.
Think about all those spoofed XT/Classic/Unlimited nodes, and how little *actual decentralization* they represented, as a metric. Think about how long it took for SegWit to activate, despite a supermajority of user+node+developer support; it literally came down to *the economic majority* versus *one giant mining cartel fighting to preserve an exploit*, with the former finally emerging victorious through the UASF. Think about [this]( and [this]( Think about how most businesses "accepting Bitcoin" use Coinbase or Bitpay, rather than running a node themselves. Think about what this does to *trust* within the network.
The bottom line is: don't let your brain short-circuit when you first see a number. *Think things through.* There is much more gray than there is black or white.

Sure, but historically speaking, recommendations against further Bitcoin investment (however well intentioned) have shaped up to be poor advice.
Before the inevitable retort of "past performance is not a guarantee of future results", I'd like to point out that many of us have spent a great deal of time analyzing Bitcoin and its potential as "money of the future", and we aren't basing our expectations on "past performance" alone.

To be perfectly clear and make sure that at least the basics are understood, Bitcoin maximalists don't try to argue that "altcoins will stop existing entirely" but rather that from architectural, ideological, and economic perspectives, Bitcoin is considerably better-designed and implemented than alternative tokens/networks, and that over time (i.e. decades, not months or years) this will become more and more evident in the market and world.

Are you taking about in 2011, 2013, 2016, or 2017? Because each of those years exhibited multi-thousand-percent returns.
Of course, if you extend your time horizon arbitrarily far, *nothing* is sustainable. But if you think that Bitcoin will never recover to (and exceed) the prices it has recently achieved, you are betting against the trend without a real leg to stand on.


Oh, dear heavens no. Bitcoin hasn't yet reached the price magnitudes necessary for stability (that would be *far* above the $20k mark).


If you think USD is a substitute for Bitcoin, you must be earlier along in your education than I'd thought. You need to do *a lot* more reading.


Not even close. Copper is not gold.


True, and it has been so for many years, while multiple massive upward revaluations (bubbles) have taken place. My view has been immensely lucrative and vindicated beyond the wildest dreams of most people.


The same could be said for snail mail when email first came upon the scene. In fact, the same *was* said.
Some nerds argued that the Internet would be a Big Deal. Most didn't care, and dismissed it until much later, when it became obvious that it really did have a lot to offer the world.


Again, Bitcoin has quite a ways to go before it reaches anything that can be considered "priced for perfection"; we have at least one more big bubble before that starts being a realistic description.
And you underestimate what I've taken into account, considerably. Yes, the powers-that-be will resist (and have been resisting, from the beginning) the rise of Bitcoin. That is expected and accounted for.


Then you haven't done your research, because I literally got into this same argument **five years ago**, and I can dig up the Reddit comments to prove it, if you really want me to.
What you're saying is not something new and fresh. People have said *the exact same thing* after every single [Bitcoin Hype Cycle]( and haven't been right yet.
It doesn't matter, though. People like you aren't able to integrate new information and update their mental schemas accordingly, no matter how much people like me try to help you do so. More often than not, naysayers who have their arguments completely debunked by Bitcoin's behavior wind up deleting their accounts or comments out of shame. I wouldn't be surprised to see you join their ranks, but it's not worth any more time trying to get through to you with actual facts and logic. You just close your metaphorical eyes and stick your metaphorical fingers in your metaphorical ears.

Let's go over what I said here and make sure the main point is understood, and then I'll give you a couple more links that will help build on top of the original statement.
*Right, you can go through and list the specific individual trade-offs that any given coin made relative to Bitcoin (and in fact I'm telling you outright that I've personally done so), but as you've correctly observed, digital scarcity can potentially be strongly assured with Bitcoin but not cryptocurrency.*
The two salient points here are that: 
1) Pretty much any meaningful or interesting technical deviations from the Bitcoin template are ultimately **trade-offs**, where an improvement along one axis is (hopefully) introduced, while an expense or cost along another axis is incurred in exchange for this benefit. We can go over the specifics of any given technical trade-off (and there will be plenty, without a doubt, and things will get very complex very fast if we're being thorough in our assessment), but it's going to vary on a case-by-case basis depending on what exactly we're putting under the proverbial microscope in that moment.
2) If we're looking at this from the perspective of speculation, profits, investments, or financial returns, we want to make sure we properly appreciate the role of *scarcity* in the bigger picture. When you said "BTC coins are scarce in the context of BTC, but not in the context of more forks or in the context of other coins" you were highlighting a critical insight that should be fully understood by anyone trying to get a mental grip on this subject: *Bitcoin* is scarce, yes, and the Nakamoto Consensus model appears to give us relatively strong game-theoretic assurances as to the preservation of this property, but Nakamoto Consensus is also (deliberately) radically convergent and self-reinforcing with respect to the network effect. That is to say, altcoins offer *less* strong assurances as to finality and scarcity, which can be seen both *a priori* and *a posteriori*.
For some must-read resources regarding the above points, see [Bitcoin - a 6-sided Market and Network Effect]( Nick Szabo's [Money, blockchains, and social scalability]( and Gwern's [Bitcoin is Worse is Better]( You can read [a couple of my thoughts regarding some flagship altcoins here]( a decent (if perhaps over-impassioned and simplistic) breakdown of liquidity effects in [The Coming Demise of the Altcoins]( and excellent expositions on Bitcoin's existential position in [Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory]( [Hyperbitcoinization: Winner Takes All]( and while we're on the subject, let's also include Szabo's classic historical walkthrough [Shelling Out: The Origins of Money]( If you have read and fully appreciated the core insights from the above links, and you are also interested in further resources that "zoom in" on a specific concept, approach, or idea (and Bitcoin's advantage relative to it), let me know.
The TL;DR here is that Bitcoin was built and optimized to be **electronic money** and came shipped with a self-reinforcing feedback-loop adoption propulsion mechanism. While it is undeniably true that objectively smaller clone/tweak networks operating in the shadow of the primary protocol will boast higher volatility in accordance with their lower liquidity, thereby attracting uninformed retail investors (especially over short-term time horizons), this doesn't represent an existential threat to Bitcoin. Indeed, we should expect profit-yielding knowledge differentials to be exploited for as long as society struggles to understand and realize the true advantages of a decentralized, energy-based monetary architecture. In other words, it's obvious why altcoins exist, and obvious why they will *continue* to exist, but from a financial perspective, a grab-bag index-fund of "top cryptocurrencies" (even if it's algorithmically rebalanced over take-your-pick timeframes) has consistently historically *under*performed relative to Bitcoin in terms of long-term price appreciation. If you really understand the links above, it's pretty obvious why.


Bitcoin is a protocol which doesn't natively recognize spin-off protocols, and within that protocol digital scarcity is relatively strongly assured. You can cryptographically verify whether any given "coin" (i.e. *transaction output*) is a legitimate Bitcoin output by simply finding the heaviest-by-hash chain and running a deterministic verification function over the data in that chain. The process by which validation occurs is described succinctly in [the original whitepaper]( If you've been sent or sold some token that doesn't validate according to the Bitcoin protocol rules, or which only exists on a chain that isn't the main-chain, you haven't actually received any bitcoins (and it is always up to the end-user to validate and ensure whether they have or have not received bitcoins).
It's true that people aren't generally very educated when it comes to cryptographic verification and open-source validation and such technical matters, and that this (again) creates an opportunity for talented salesmen to take advantage of. And on top of that, most people get very uncomfortable when confronted with their own lack of knowledge, and would prefer the simplistic-but-misleading sales brochures to the nuanced, thoroughly-considered engineering realities.




Okay, so let's be clear here: if you're *asking others to do your research for you, you're trusting, not verifying*. I will, of course, help to point you in the right direction, but the wider point that I'm making is that **you need to try to get in the habit of doing this sort of thing yourself**, if you want to maximize your chances of success, knowledge, and profits.
Fees: here we see misleading statements in both columns. With regards to the left column, see the [Lightning Factories]( and [Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment
Channel Networks]( papers, and with regards to the right, per-transaction proof-of-work is still a type of fee (albeit a small one), and this is directly commensurate with the degree of "weak subjectivity" that is introduced into the foundations of an alternative block-lattice stake/representative-based consensus mechanism. In other words, the transaction costs being represented as "Free" when they're actually abstracted into the protocol consensus as (almost certainly economically unsustainable) subjectivity is disingenuous at best.
Ease-of-use: similarly misleading; time-locks in Lightning Network are user-configurable; see [the Lightning whitepaper]( (which is admittedly dense) or [Rusty Russell's short breakdown here]( Even setting aside watchtower-esque solutions, the user has full control over the specifics of their Lightning contract state (e.g. timeout duration and current balance). You have to be online to transact (or realize that a transaction has occurred), **period**, so the right column is essentially dismissing the "until ready to sign payment" while not affording the same treatment to the left-column (which would presumably read "until ready to consider payment received").
Availability: the Lightning Network is fully available. Use it yourself if you'd like.
Staking: incorrect. Recipients can receive funds through Lightning without staking anything.
Security: (see *Ease-of-use* and *Fees* sections above)
Environment: (see *Fees* section above); this final row is also illustrative in that it shows a fundamental disconnect from the bigger picture; the important assurances you want of your money are the "objectivity" which energy-denominated consensus taps into.

There are patent concerns (an unlevel playing field is not good for decentralization) when it comes to covert ASICBoost, but that's only the tip of the iceberg.
A much bigger concern is the perverse incentives the covert form introduces, like *upgrade inertia, inefficiencies in transaction processing, and motivation to mine empty or near-empty blocks*.
Overt ASICBoost doesn't introduce these sorts of incentives or issues. It's much less harmful to the network on a technical level.

It is lower than that, actually. Try it yourself. You can get 2 satoshi/byte transactions confirmed reasonably quickly today. The "$5 average" is not relevant to what *you* have to pay for a standard transaction, because it is heavily skewed by the inclusion of huge batching transactions from exchanges and services, and naive fee-estimation software.
But we don't want fake merchant adoption, really. It doesn't help Bitcoin meaningfully unless they *actually* accept it (rather than accepting dollars through Bitcoin payment processors).

[This article has an *excellent* comparison (and technical explanation) of the two techniques.](
TL;DR: the only downside to the overt approach is that 2 version bytes (which, according to BIP9, are used for soft-fork deployment signalling) are used as a nonce instead. From users' perspectives, this isn't really a drawback at all.

@_date: 2018-02-06 03:01:49
Unfortunately both answers to you so far are incorrect.
Segwit is a new transaction format on Bitcoin which allows more transactions to fit inside each block by increasing the maximum blocksize and weighting the different bytes of the transactions differently. Basically, the "signature data" bytes are separated from the "base data" bytes in a Segwit transaction, which offers a number of great benefits.
If big Bitcoin services like Coinbase use Segwit, Bitcoin will be able to process many more transactions per second than it could otherwise, and everyone can expect to be able to pay lower fees on their transactions.
Beyond that, Segwit paves the way for other powerful Bitcoin innovations (like Schnorr signatures, scripting improvements, and second layers like the Lightning Network), so if Coinbase implements it, they are a lot more "future-ready" than they would be without it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:54:16
That is literally the status quo...
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:09:18


I already have multiple published, and more in the works. But thank you.


That is not an issue (you seem to have it backwards). Any address type can *receive* from a Segwit address just fine; support for this is the default and requires no special or new engineering.


No, it was not. None of those links demonstrate any exchanges or services "not supporting receiving from a Segwit address"; the first one is regarding sending *to* a Segwit address, the second one is regarding a low-fee unconfirmed transaction not showing up in a wallet yet, and the third one is regarding sending *to* a bech32 address (which is not yet recognized on the sending platform).
The only "problem" here is you being confused. Those links don't show what you think they show.


Actually, I'm explaining to you exactly what you're confused about, and the source of your confusion, and presenting you with the truth so that you can clear it up. When you're confronted with the truth, you seem to have a habit of ignoring it and trying to change the subject to distract from what just happened.
One example of this happening was you saying that I was the one who brought up soft forks (and demanding a quote from you to show that it was you who did so). When I provided such a quote, you changed the subject.
Another example is where you tried to accuse me of "selective reading" when in fact it was you who was guilty of doing so. After I spent the time to explain that I had not done so, and then later pointed out that you *had*, you changed the subject.
A list of other examples can be found in the various non sequiturs you've trotted out, which I repeatedly explained the irrelevance of, only to be met with the same type of (distractionary) response.
There's an obvious pattern here.


I have explained, multiple times now, why this is false and why no "segregation" is caused by enabling Schnorr+Coinjoin transactions in a particular wallet/client implementation by default. In fact, I put it in bold in my last comment, and went out of my way to direct your attention to it. I'll paste it once more here, and maybe this time you'll actually read (or even better, *understand*) it.
**Any block-explorer that didn't display the transactions properly would simply add more privacy by doing so (not strong privacy or anything, but local obfuscation if nothing else), which would be an advantage. Any wallets that don't support the Schnorrified Coinjoining would simply not be able to participate in the process, and would continue working as they always have. They would still be able to receive payments that were sourced from those who did aggregate and mix the sends, and they would show up in their old legacy wallet just like always (just like any legacy wallet can receive a Segwit payment and never even worry about the format the sender used). There is no disadvantage that I can see here, and certainly no segregation that would result from the feature being implemented and used by those who preferred it (whether it was the default for any given wallet or not).**

Whether or not you run a full node is entirely orthogonal to the purpose of the Lightning Network.
Running a node is entirely about limiting counterparty trust. That is the incentive to do so. It's perfectly fine if you (or anyone else) choose *not* to run a full node, but it's important to understand that this necessarily changes the level of trust involved in your usage of Bitcoin. If you recognize and are personally fine with the trust trade-off involved, then your choice to not to run a node isn't a problem. You're not helping nor harming anyone else with that decision.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:18:21
There are a few (slightly different but fundamentally equivalent) icarnations of it, but I really like two in particular: [The Bitcoin Hype Cycle]( and the [Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory]( Krawisz wrote [a bit]( about it, and Ledra Capital did [a good piece]( on the multi-sided network effect that is worth a read. Before any of that was written, Satoshi wrote [a very brief thought experiment]( that laid the foundation for all of this, and it seems like the trickiest part of the whole process is the very earliest stages, bootstrapping from "worth nothing" to "worth something"... after that, it's mostly a matter of basic incentives. "If you suddenly drop a deflationary money into a bucket of inflationary alternatives, the rational response is obvious." I wouldn't say the result is *inevitable*, but it's pretty close.
Maybe some altcoin will come along and somehow steal the prize, though I personally haven't seen any that seem to have that sort of potential (or even close to it); Bitcoin is fundamentally optimized as *decentralized sound money*, and every alternative so far seems to be making trade-offs to veer from that original paradigm. You can't rule out the possibility entirely, though. But aside from that "risk", it's hard to see how the pattern could play out any way but the obvious one.

Haven't you ever heard the phrase: "Don't trust, verify"?


Manually poring over transactions is almost *never* worthwhile, actually... I continue to overestimate people like you.


False, actually. You can get a transaction confirmed in a timely manner (a few blocks) with less than 10 sat/byte. If you would perform the simple experiment suggested above, you'd be able to confirm this firsthand. For some reason you'd rather not do so (likely to cling to a false narrative).
It's funny how people such as yourself feel belittled by the statement of true (and trivially verifiable) facts. Talk about oversensitive!
@_date: 2018-11-05 02:52:17


Bitcoin is a commodity (a digital commodity) and allows direct ownership (through exclusive private key possession). The "floors" that you've identified exist in Bitcoin, too.
If your argument is that "digital commodities don't count as 'real' commodities" then you'll have to elaborate on why you feel that way, otherwise your argument completely lacks substance and falls flat.


The exact same "arguments" can, obviously, be applied to Bitcoin, without any detriment to the integrity of the reasoning whatsoever. If you feel otherwise, explain precisely why (it's more likely than not that your attempt to do so will tangibly demonstrate the flaw in the argument, so I actually do recommend trying).


Well, that's simply not true. Bitcoin has accumulated billions of dollars' worth of computation cycles (and the electricity and associated logistical costs thereof) "behind it", and if you want to assert that this is "nothing" then you'll have to elaborate on why you think so. 


Two points on this: *not all uses of money are infinitesimally temporary*, and *because of liquidity limitations, it is not true that bitcoin is equally useful at $1 and at $10k*... in fact, Bitcoin is **much, much** less useful (and valuable in a practical sense) at $1/coin than at $10k/coin simply because of what the overall market is able to accommodate at those respective price levels. At $1/coin it's *literally impossible* to execute multi-million dollar transactions without losing massive percentages along the way due to slippage, and this phenomenon holds true in less pronounced ways even on smaller transaction amounts. And to reiterate: economic processes take nonzero amounts of time, and plenty of these processes (and the agents involved) are meaningfully sensitive to market fluctuations of the monetary technology used (whether it be fiat, gold, or cryptocurrency). Pretending otherwise is, frankly, rather silly.


If losses (**or gains**) are to be had, then yes, investors will be the ones reaping them. I don't think anyone is arguing or disagreeing on that point. Ultimately, if Bitcoin is net valuable to the world, investors will capitalize on that surplus value that it provides, enables, realizes, or taps into. If it isn't, investors will eat the losses. That's obvious (and uninteresting on its own); the question is whether it *is* valuable or not, and I personally have not seen anyone convincingly argue that it isn't.

Up 1000% then down 80% still leaves you up 120% from where you started.
Even better is going up roughly *4000%* and then dropping by only *60%* or so. But the specifics aren't what's important, just the end result; value isn't just being stored, it's being captured.

Some of us are. I certainly do swing trade a little bit, and take profits where I believe it is appropriate to do so (I started selling when we first climbed above $6k, which was a bit hasty in retrospect... and kept selling up until prices around $18k), but I also make sure to keep the majority of my coins in cold-storage at all times, and I can't speak on behalf of anyone other than myself.


Great job, that's an awesome return. Seriously, congratulations. Also good that you have a price target for a re-buy, too (having a plan is important).


I understand where you're coming from on this one, and it's definitely a mentality that we should do our best to fight against (and I've personally made that exact mistake at a casino, literally, in my past... multiple times). Opportunity cost is a real thing, and shouldn't be ignored.
My counterpoint to the above is that Bitcoin has exhibited a bullish trend (and tends to "surprisingly" burst upwards, seemingly out of nowhere, on a relatively regular basis) since it was created, so I like to keep a persistent investment in it at all times, "just in case", knowing that I can't perfectly time  or predict the market (no one can). Having cashed out far more than my initial investment long ago, I feel better, since I *do* consider it "playing with house money"... but you're right, this is a dangerous mentality and if I'm being perfectly honest, it's fallacious at its core.


Agreed. Sounds like we're both pretty much on the same wavelength (though I might be a little more bullish on Bitcoin in the long-term).
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:31:34
That is incorrect. 1 BTC in the past (assuming "the past" means "prior to August 2017") is worth less than 1 BTC today, because bitcoins were trading for significantly less than the current price in that past.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has not hard forked (not even once) in the past 3 years. What *has* happened, and what you are likely trying to allude to, is that multiple *altcoin airdrops* have been granted automatically to holders of Bitcoin over this time period.
What you said, as stated, is technically incorrect. If you had said something more precise and accurate, like "Any private keys which entailed ownership of 1 BTC prior to August 2017 currently entail ownership of more than just 1 BTC, assuming that the various airdrops granted to those private keys have not yet been claimed," then that would be true.

It doesn't seem like you understand what Bitcoin Core is, in that case, which means this thread is meant for someone like you. Core is a *software client*, not a cryptocurrency. "Bitcoin Core" is to "Bitcoin ABC" as "Bitcoin" is to "Bitcoin Cash" (or "Bcash"). 
There are other client implementations that are compatible with Bitcoin Core (like btcd, Bitcore, Knots, Parity Bitcoin, etc) which connect to the Bitcoin network and allow you to use the *Bitcoin* currency.
When you use "Bitcoin Core" to refer to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, it's a misuse of terminology, exactly like saying "Do you accept Bitcoin ABC?" would be incorrect if you were asking about BCH. Rather than avoiding confusion, it just shows that you don't really understand what you're talking about. Imagine someone saying "I watch the emailnet on my YouTube" to you... you would probably be able to guess that they meant that they like to watch YouTube videos (or something like that), but you'd also realize that the person saying it doesn't have a solid grasp of the terminology they're trying to use.

1) We did increase the maximum blocksize limit. Stop lying by pretending otherwise.
2) They did a lot more than just increase the blocksize limit, they completely broke compatibility with Bitcoin (even at the SPV level) and fundamentally changed the difficulty algorithm away from Satoshi's design (and have made many more deviations from Bitcoin since, including automatic ten-block checkpoints which replace Bitcoin's proof-of-work determinism with a new consensus mechanism that can't be trustlessly verified by those who aren't online and witnessing it at the time of the checkpoint... see the third-to-last sentence of the whitepaper to appreciate what a radical deviation this represents from Bitcoin).
3) It's a bit disingenuous to say that "the community was split", and much more accurate to say that *extreme* superminority decided to *leave* the Bitcoin community. Even with Bitmain gambling by shoving all-in on BCH and Ver attempting to use his Bitcoin-related IP (including rbtc, the .com website, and the  Twitter handle) to confuse and mislead newcomers, the BCH altcoin is currently worth less than 4% of the real Bitcoin, and all metrics regarding BCH adoption, usage, or progress are indicating a steady collapse into total irrelevance and abandonment.

SegWit's capacity benefits are manifold and still in the process of manifesting.
The longer it takes for users to switch over, *the more obvious it is that increased capacity is not an actual priority to most users*. The slower that SegWit adoption happens, the stronger the proof of how ridiculously fake the manufactured "capacity crisis" really was.
Astroturfers have tried their damnedest to take control, but Bitcoin is good at resisting such things. Only naive people have fallen for the narrative.

Anecdotally, I took that ridiculously-easy "engineering challenge" quiz you guys put up a couple years ago, had a phone interview, and even though the tone of the conversation was pleasant enough, any time I started to talk about anything *remotely* technical, the girl I was talking to clearly didn't understand a lick of what I was saying. It was surreal; she would ask "Have you built anything like a Bitcoin wallet before?" and I would answer "Yep! I've built a few different wallets, the stacks I used were these, and some interesting notes about the experience were X, Y, and Z! I'm happy to email you a link to the GitHub repos for at least a couple of these if you'd like." Then she would fall silent for a few seconds, and be completely unable to follow the question up with something relevant, or apparently even begin to appreciate the answer. It was obvious that whoever was assigned to be hiring engineers didn't know a thing about engineering... which says a lot about how Coinbase does things.
A few days later she emailed me saying "Thanks but no thanks!"
It really felt like I was speaking to a child. Even when almost every single question felt *perfectly* tailor-made for my experience, the person on the other end was just not knowledgeable enough to have a conversation about what we were supposed to be having a conversation about.
Even if you guys had offered the job to me, it's doubtful I would have accepted... but it wouldn't be because I "don't want to work at a company", it would be because I "don't want to work at a company which is built on foundations of incompetence", which is (regrettably) the impression I've received from the interview experience I went through, not to mention the numerous fiascos you guys have been involved with over the past 16 months or so...
So, yeah. The problem is almost certainly more internal than you are trying to imply. You guys have issues, and painting it like "Wow no one qualified wants to work at *any* company!" is either disingenuous or outright stupid; I can't even tell which... you *do* work at Coinbase, after all.

I've always found [Paul Sztorc's treatment of the subject]( particularly compelling.
I also have never seen Poelstra's "On Stake and Consensus" document given the treatment I believe it deserves, at least with regards to "pure PoS" solutions. Slashing (and other such jazz) are, as far as I can tell, fundamentally just obfuscation at the end of the day... and the "weak subjectivity" argument has always seemed to boil down to: "Imagine a blockchain... *but with trust!*"
I *don't* think that "it's clear that PoW sucks" at all, and I think that's a fairly big assumption to go in with. I think the conclusion that "PoW is doomed to centralization" is pessimistic to the point of defeatism, and I am particularly interested to see how things play out now that Bitcoin (and thus PoW) is finally reaching "The Big Leagues", so to speak. It's still early days, in my opinion, and it remains to be seen how exactly this wondrous experiment ultimately winds up playing out. Every proposal I've seen so far that deviates from "the Bitcoin formula" (as I understand it) seems, to me, to be a regression. Bitcoin (and PoW) might not be perfect, but from what I can tell, it's as close as we've got (so far).

Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer** electronic cash system. Its core value-add is that it is decentralized.
As Satoshi said at the beginning:


That's one reason why it's so ridiculous to see people trying to highlight and emphasize the "cash" part of Bitcoin's whitepaper subtitle; electronic cash existed before Bitcoin, and what makes Bitcoin special is that it's **decentralized** electronic cash.
Satoshi understood things very deeply, and made a number of design decisions that most people (even those who consider themselves "well informed about crypto/blockchains") don't yet appreciate. You've found a great quote that helps to show a little of what Satoshi thought about Bitcoin, but it's also worth remembering his other quote: "I'm better with code than with words".
Satoshi deliberately programmed the blocksize limit as a hard consensus rule, then went on to oppose and discourage others from trying to "patch out" this consensus rule without community-wide consensus and a long-lead-time, multiple-precautions-taken update. Anyone who tries to quote Satoshi's "we can phase it in" comment as if it indicates that Nakamoto would support a specific incompatible fork proposal is either very ignorant or (more likely) purposefully trying to mislead others.

It seems to me that "They wanted to increase the block size. They consider us as an attack by not raising it" is seriously misleading, because it strongly implies that we did not increase the blocksize limit in Bitcoin. We did. So unless you're trying to say that "They **incorrectly** consider us as an attack **based on a false premise**..." then the comment, as written, feeds into the myth that I'm criticizing.
Your comment *also* misleadingly implied that there was a large/meaningful split in Bitcoin (i.e. that a significant fraction of the community went one way, and the rest went another). All metrics clearly indicate that the overwhelming majority of the community remained unified and in support of Bitcoin, while a tiny, **tiny** fraction of the community splintered off to create and push their own spin-off altcoin. I understand that you didn't explicitly say that there was a 50/50 split or anything like that, but the phrasing you used definitely makes it seem like there was a sizable fracture in the community (which there truthfully was not, despite how loud Ver is).
By way of analogy, if someone came around and claimed that "The scientific community was split between 2 different ideologies (Flat Earth versus Spherical Earth) and will be for a long time to come" then certainly you would say that this misrepresents the reality of the situation, right?

So the problem here is not Bitcoin, it's multiple contradictory assumptions you are (probably accidentally) making. 
Assumption 1: Bitcoin has to increase in value over time (because supply is limited and demand is "continually increasing with adoption, population growth and economic prosperity").
Assumption 2: Bitcoin might not necessarily increase in value over time (it has a nonzero risk).
These already directly contradict each other, but you're trying to have it both ways.
Assumption 3: There is no possible equilibrium at which *some* agents will be willing to spend their bitcoins while *others* will retain their coins in the hopes of future returns.
Assumption 3, in particular, is silly (and inherently assumes an identical risk tolerance and demand profile of every single economic agent in the universe, an exceptionally unrealistic assumption).
Again, there's no paradox here. Some people want apples, other people want more money. The people with the money (which would be bitcoins, in the case of a bitcoin-based economy) who want apples instead, will trade their money (BTC) in exchange for apples. This leaves both transactors satisfied, regardless of how price-deflationary of an underlying asset the money is. If it is exceptionally deflationary, then the apple buyer should choose to trade a very small amount (as small as they are willing to part with) in exchange for their apples, and should seek to replenish their supply of coins as swiftly and effectively as they are able to, lest they miss out on future returns.

The whitepaper describes what Bitcoin is quite well (other than surface-level stuff like "1 CPU, 1 vote" when CPUs don't stand a chance of getting any meaningful hash share in today's mining landscape). Bitcoin still follows the "unstructured simplicity" described in the whitepaper, and has (by far) the most accumulated SHA-256d work, so the chain is still very much the canonical Bitcoin chain. It is still peer-to-peer electronic cash, still uses the same Script as always, and we've even implemented some of Satoshi's ideas for later improvements to Bitcoin, like high-frequency trading HTLCs (even networking them together into the Lightning Network) and RBF.
Fortunately, Bitcoin is still just as Bitcoin as it ever was, and Satoshi would almost certainly be very happy to see how far it has come and how much it has grown while still adhering to the same old beautiful vision.
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:34:09
Great question. Basically, because the changes relative to Bitcoin's architecture/approach are either incremental or fundamental, and I've taken the (incredibly demanding quantity of) time to assess them each in turn, if not utterly comprehensively then at least sufficiently in accordance with their respective "seriousness" or "influence coefficient" achieved in the world of cryptocurrency thus far. My personal assessment of the "respectable Bitcoin maximalists" (e.g. the group of people that the names in the list above came from) is that they've essentially done the same thing, and arrived at similar (if not identical) conclusions on the subject.
In other words, after fully grokking Bitcoin in full, I've spent thousands of hours comparing and contrasting its model to the myriad "alt models" that have been created and explored since 2009, and Bitcoin has won out in every case so far. Nakamoto's high-level prescience is truly unparalleled.

This is slightly inaccurate; SegWit transactions are serialized such that the signature data is moved to the end of *the transaction*, not the block. The witness data is marked so that it can be stripped out when needed, but it is still right there alongside the base transaction data by default (not elsewhere in the block).

Well, Bitcoin was **never** that to begin with; the whole system is based on the **opposite** of costlessness. Bitcoin is deliberately **costly** (that's the reason why proof-of-work works as a practical consensus mechanism to begin with, and how the system can continue to function with a finite number of total possible coins over longer time horizons).


Bitcoin is a **money** system for anyone who wants to use it. It has been possible to launder money through Bitcoin since it originally took on a nonzero trading value, but that was many years ago.


How did we let Bitcoin continue to grow and thrive and increase in value? By working hard on improving it (and the ecosystem around it) and educating those who are willing to learn.

Plenty of us are invested in Bitcoin (and up massively on our investment) and *did* expect such a crash to happen. As an example, two months ago, I explicitly predicted this would happen:




Bitcoin has a habit of shooting up a few thousand percent, and then going through a significant retracement to find a new (higher) price floor after doing so. If you thought that this community was blindsided by the recent price drop, you haven't been paying very close attention. We even had an [announcement thread stickied to the top of the subreddit for over a month]( warning about exactly this.

This is false. Having spent *a lot* of time getting to know Roger, I can say with certainty that the opposite is the case.
He is a proven liar. I myself have caught him lying (and proven that he was deliberately doing so) on numerous separate occasions. When I compile the proof together and ask him for comment, he invariably stops responding, no matter how politely I phrase the inquiry. These days, I have generally stopped going out of my way to be overly polite, and simply point out the disinformation and falsehoods directly; he predictably refuses to respond (at least on his main account).


This is similarly false.


Unfortunately, if you are well-informed and a principled human being, you'll likely never get that chance, because Roger refuses to engage in honest dialogue with such people. Sometimes he'll "debate" with knowledgeable people, but his end invariably consists of talking-point repetition (no matter how contextually irrelevant) and lowest-common-denominator emotional appeals which almost always just serve as subject changes and distractions.


As someone who has spent a considerable amount of time **proving**, with absolutely no room for ambiguity, that Roger is a willing and enthusiastic liar (who seems to be motivated by greed and megalomania more than any sort of altruism or nobility), I can tell you that this statement is objectively false. At this point, there is a **long** list of instances wherein Roger has deliberately lied to push forward his own personal agenda(s); as an employee who is literally paid to further his agenda, you are (of course) going to obstinately refuse to acknowledge anything on the list, but that doesn't mean anything other than that *you* are a deceptive and immoral person, too.
It is a sad fact that Roger is an immoral liar and an enemy of Bitcoin (as both a network and a movement). It is even more unfortunate how well-funded he is, and how willing he is to eschew anything resembling principles or integrity in the name of furthering his own personal interests.

Your article continually argues that it is a "coincidence" that fees have dropped after SegWit activated. This is not true at all, but to understand properly you have to remember the reason why it took so long for SegWit to activate at all: (covert) ASICBOOST.
Bitmain went on record saying that they don't use ASICBOOST on mainnet. Of course, this makes no sense (and they obviously do). Even so, the activation of SegWit put them in the unenviable position of either keeping up the facade or losing great face. They chose to keep up the facade, but were unwilling to relinquish the efficiency advantage offered by the exploit. Their solution was to launch Bcash, an altcoin defined by the fact that it *doesn't support SegWit*.
This means that those who were trying to manfacture the illusion of a capacity crisis (via spamming the network with unnecessary transactions) are suddenly faced with a real opportunity cost by continuing to do so. On top of that, their spam will have a diminishing effect (and they know it) now that SegWit has effectively paved the way forward for a doubling of the per-block transaction capacity.
As rational and greedy agents, they have pretty much stopped spamming altogether. Of course, this means that the blocks are no longer full (they're averaging about 0.75-0.8 MB in size these days) and that normal Bitcoin users are able to enjoy lower fees as a result.
It's not a coincidence at all, you just have to spend a minute thinking about it.

The figure is *trivially* gameable, and there are meaningful incentives to do exactly that. These incentives have been at play for years.

Every buy is also a sale.
What you *might* want to do is download exchange data (plenty of sources out there for this), and classify the trades where price moved *up* relative to its previous location to be "buys" and other trades to be "sells" or "no-movements"; alternatively, if you're getting real-time data and are able to compare the live order-books with the trades being made, you can base your categories off of who was the maker and who was the taker in the trade. Short of some classification scheme like this, though, there's no real meaningful way to delineate "buys" from "sells" because, as I said, they're both the same thing, just trades viewed from different perspectives.

What features?
Also, it's easy to change a centralized entity. The very fact that Bitcoin is *resistant* to change *is* its value. 
I know that it is hard to fathom, and a completely counterintuitive worldview. But think about it for a bit, honestly. If Bitcoin (the protocol) is malleable, there really are no protections afforded by its blockchain architecture and there is no value added. Trust is back in the formula.
Put another way: digital tokens are not scarce. Bitcoins are. 
It really doesn't make sense to even *want* the protocol properties of Bitcoin to be able to frictionlessly change, other than uncontroversial performance upgrade stuff. The whole premise is that Bitcoin is a stable consensus protocol, beyond the whims of men (or as close to it as possible) and governed much more strongly by math than by power-hungry people and corporations and governments. If the core, underlying protocol is strong enough to resist that stuff in a meaningful way, and retain its fundamental properties in the face of adversity, then the equilibrium state is **ideal money**, which should (in theory) result in a **black hole of value**.
This is "ten minutes before the Singularity" type stuff. It's heavy. But it's what got a lot of us excited about this project to begin with. 
It's possible that the people who "get" Bitcoin in the way that I'm talking about are now outnumbered by the newcomers (who don't) by this point. And it's totally possible, as much as I hate to admit it, that the get-rich-quickers (which, admit it, deep down we can all empathize with) ultimately have their way and rob the Bitcoin brand name of its spirit and purpose in an attempt to simplify and "improve" it.

Quite a bit, it sounds like. One of the cooler aspects is the "smart privacy" stuff.
Your question (to me) seems like asking "Are you really that pumped about being able to selectively reveal information in one direction, or is there something else that I'm missing?" in response to public key cryptography.

Actually, what you're saying here is unintentionally misleading. The mining reward will drop to relatively miniscule levels within two decades; it's hard to intuitively appreciate how dramatically a geometric function behaves after just a few iterations. If the transaction fees are not supplanting the inflation subsidy in 18 years or so, Bitcoin has a serious problem, and it surviving another century (at least at any meaningful scale) is a highly dubious proposition.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:07:10
Hashrate follows price. It's a lagging metric, because it's impossible to instantaneously produce mining hardware. Put another way, the chip fabrication process is relatively slow when compared to price movements in this space.
The hashrate increase we're seeing now is the result of decisions made months ago. Decisions made in response to the bull market.

Simple: every single statement and claim that I have made has stood strong, without anything resembling a refutation materializing from your end. Go ahead, look back over the whole exchange, you'll see exactly what I mean. There aren't any dangling loose ends.
Meanwhile, you've made *tons* of half-baked arguments and false claims that I have picked apart and refuted directly. You claimed there was a paradox, and I demonstrated that there was no such thing. You claimed that a 2000% annual return for Bitcoin was not repeatable, and I explained that it was not only so, but that *it has happened many times already*. You claimed that "nothing" I have said is "fact or logic", and I pointed out that I had just finished saying that "Copper is not gold", which means that *you have inadvertently just argued that copper is literally gold*. You claimed that USD is a substitute for Bitcoin (as if that is meaningfully true and thus precludes significant success on Bitcoin's part), and I pointed out that this argument holds equally well for Rai stones being a substitute for USD (and correctly predicted that you would refuse to acknowledge this point).
You don't see how I am claiming to have won the argument because you are wilfully ignoring 90% of the points I'm making, just like so many of your predecessors did.


Considering the fact that I *already pointed out that this same arguments holds equally true for Rai stones being a substitute for USD*, and you have chosen to leave it be, it stands to reason that you must be arguing here that Rai stones are a substitute for USD. I must say, this is a better argument than your previous one that "Copper is gold", but not by much.


Tell yourself whatever you need to hear, buddy.


The sky is indeed blue. Unfortunately for you, this is a [non sequitur]( and is entirely irrelevant to the discussion. I have made no claims to the contrary, and the color of the sky has no bearing on any of the statements either of us have made in this thread.
You knew that, of course, but you desperately want "the last word" and felt like this might somehow serve to ridicule the points I've been making and the arguments I've put forth. It flopped miserably, as you can see.

That's because there's not really any merit to BCH; if you're interested in an altcoin with high transaction capacity, there are plenty that have higher capacity *and* lower fees than BCH, and many of them handle more transaction volume in the real world anyway.
Furthermore, BCH is marketed through lies and deceit, which Bitcoiners generally don't approve of. In short: BCH is a scam-coin, which is why almost no one outside of Roger Ver's sockpuppet-filled echo-chamber advocates or supports it.

It is, and it can. Bitcoin represents a quantum upgrade to *money itself*. That doesn't seem to have sunk in.


Yes, markets work in cycles, and Bitcoin grows in bubbles. That's been the case ever since it started growing. In fact, analyzing the eerily repetitive, self-similar bubble pattern of Bitcoin was what made me initially invest in it so many years ago. The crashes are part of the experience, and as a swing trader who is willing to take profits with 10-15% of my holdings (and has historically traded *incredibly* successfully in this market), I have already set aside post-bubble funds to try and buy a little back towards what I hope to be a market bottom. This *is* another awesome aspect of Bitcoin, and if you thought the price would shoot directly up without any corrections or drops along the way, you are even more confused than you first seemed.


Right; the point is not that Bitcoin's world domination is *inevitable*, it's that *if* it is ever used in the capacity of a "spending currency" at meaningful scale, it will come *after* the market has been saturated.
You are the one saying "There's a paradox, look, Bitcoin can't offer returns and then also be a spendable currency!" I am explaining in simple terms how it can indeed do both. Now you're changing the argument to "Well you must have no experience in other investments, and Bitcoin's price is volatile, and it's not inevitable that it will take over the world!" I do have investment experience outside of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is volatile and that is not a problem from my perspective, and I am not arguing that there is anything like a guarantee of world domination.

Decent compilation, hopefully you're aware of Nakamoto Institute already.
Since you did do a deep dive, I'm surprised to see you arrive at this particular conclusion:


My impression after an obsessive deep-dive (or two, or three) was that it's *obvious* beyond doubt that Satoshi was one person.
His writing style was remarkably consistent; it doesn't take an expert in stylometrics to determine that *if* Satoshi was a group effort, they clearly delegated the "public communications" role to a single individual, and never let anyone else near the microphone.
The thing is, the *vast* majority of the public communications Satoshi put out were *technical* in nature. He would walk through his thought process on different design elements or updates or options being considered on a regular basis, and he didn't shy from diving into the implementation minutiae. Whoever was doing the communicating obviously understood the code backwards and forwards; I had the unshakeable impression that the Satoshi doing all the speaking was also the Satoshi who built the whole thing.
He was an incredibly insightful and thorough thinker who had a knack for the Bird's Eye View, and he worked very hard on Bitcoin... but it wasn't like the first version was bug-free or anything. On the Szabo section you say:


The first version of Bitcoin allowed anyone to spend anyone else's coins with a super-easy-to-insert op code, it allowed miners to print themselves billions of bitcoins by taking advantage of a value-overflow issue, it allowed any miner to DoS the network with a relatively simple-to-code transaction flood script, included *poker* and *marketplace* stubs of code that were never finished (much less used), and wasn't even properly limited to 21M coins (it included perpetual inflation, with 4 batches of 21M coins being produced every mibillenium). It also was Windows-only. Some of those are pretty serious bugs or oversights.
Finally, just the fact that Satoshi managed to keep his identity secret so successfully is a strong indication of it being an individual effort (bulletproof op sec gets superexponentially more difficult for each additional person involved).
The bottom line here is that it seems **much** more likely that Satoshi was a single person than a group effort. I don't see any actual arguments to the contrary, to be honest.

 A good hash function (like SHA-256) takes an input of *any* length, and creates a deterministic output of a small, fixed length from it. So you can take a sentence like "Hello, world!" and hash it, and it will make a 32-byte output, or you can take a full-length Shakespeare play and hash *that*, and it will create a different 32-byte output. If you hash the same input it will always create the same output, but you can't know what that output will be unless you actually try hashing the same input yourself (in other words, "guess and check").
Hashing is useful outside of cryptocurrencies because you can take an entire program (or a password) and verify it by hashing it and comparing it against what its hash is supposed to be (which can be transmitted or stored separately). It's useful as a proof-of-work function for Bitcoin because it's easy to check that someone's input data hashes to something in particular, and because you can't generate an *input* from a given *output* (in other words, a hash function is "one-way", and can't be reversed). This means that we can make an arbitrary rule, like "The hash output must start with ten or more '0's for the input to be considered valid" and the only way to find an input that satisfies that rule is to try one, check if it starts with enough zeros, and if not, try another one (and keep going until you find one that does). Once you find a good input, you can announce it to the world, and even if it took you a hundred trillion tries (you performed that much "work") it is easy for anyone else to verify that your final input is good/valid (they just need to hash it once themselves to "prove that you did the work").
It won't "run out" because Bitcoin keeps making it where more and more zeros are needed in order for an input to be "valid" (in other words, the *difficulty* is increasing).
It's a lot less like solving a complicated calculus equation, and a lot more like rolling fifty dice and hoping to roll all snake-eyes in the process. And this "work" you do doesn't help with *anything* other than securing the Bitcoin blockchain (otherwise it would actually complicate the incentive structure involved and conceivably introduce a vulnerability into the system).
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:15:03
Short answer: **no**.
Longer answer: [when it comes to mining bitcoin, the world's supercomputers *combined* would be hashing at a rate *much less than* 0.01 to 0.001% of the network.]( The LHC boasts [on the order of 100,000 cores]( (or [~200k CPUs]( plus the [power of the WLGC]( and though these resources combined are capable of [absolutely staggering levels of data throughput]( crucially, [the computations and analysis involved are "general-purpose"]( rather than specialized for a specific role like SHA-256 hashing.
The Bitcoin network is many, many, many orders of magnitude more powerful than the LHC (including the supplemental worldwide-distributed grid network involved), but *only when it comes to hashing*. For computing anything else, the LHC is going to be unimaginably more powerful (SHA-256 ASICs won't really do you any good on other sorts of computations).
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:42:30
...and as I said above, **not a single Bitcoin block was successfully mined, according to that article**, because we are *way* past the point where anything other than a SHA-256d ASIC stands a meaningful chance of finding a successful nonce for a valid Bitcoin block.
It is a common misconception that a supercomputer (or a fleet/cluster of normal computers) could possibly mine Bitcoin competitively these days. That era is far behind us.

Sure: if you want to enjoy effectively instant and almost-fee-free Bitcoin transactions, the Lightning Network allows you to do so. There's the usage incentive for most users.
By allocating capital into a Lightning channel and keeping it balanced, you can also help to route others' payments (and charge fees for doing so), so this represents another (marginal) incentive for participation. However, Lightning's primary advantages and benefits are not "easy money for payment routers" or anything like that; routing fees are merely a secondary property, and ideally we want them remain minimized (fortunately open market competition seems to ensure this will likely remain the case).
You seem to be thinking about it somewhat backwards, wondering "How much money can I really make from this?" rather than "How much cheaper and faster is this going to make my Bitcoin payments?" 


That's probably correct at the moment. Again, Lightning wasn't designed to be a moneymaking scheme, it was designed to facilitate instant, almost-fee-free Bitcoin payments. If you want to make money off of Bitcoin, your best bet is probably via speculative investment (i.e. buying and holding), not routing or mining. If you want to transact quickly and/or cheaply with Bitcoin, your best bet is probably via the Lightning Network.


No, the Bitcoin price increasing would not make the Lightning Network less suitable for microtransactions at all. It's unclear where this impression would have originated from, but the answer to your question is definitely no.

It is in place just like the rest of the consensus rules are. And it's hard to argue that their coins would be "worthless" but easy to argue that their coins would be "worth less", just like we see with altcoin spinoffs/airdrops like BCH, which made controversial consensus changes itself.


Oh dear, no. Yet another egregious misunderstanding out of you! I'm noticing a pattern...
The protocol doesn't "punish making changes", it punishes *breaking from consensus*. Plenty of changes are made on a daily basis; most have zero consensus impact.

Have you ever seen the mod logs of rbtc discussed or analyzed? The only times I ever have are when I myself bring the subject up over there, and I am *always*, without fail, called horrible things for doing so (no matter how polite I am being). No one is ever willing to acknowledge the facts that those mod logs reveal, and in fact go out of their way to attack anyone who references them honestly.
Given the truths above, how exactly are the open mod logs conferring any superiority? There does not seem to be any benefits being realized from them, and in fact, I have firsthand proof of harm that they have done (in the form of added hostility and toxicity directed at those who would speak of them).


To clarify, this sub is moderated to keep the discussion on **Bitcoin** and not **any** altcoins (except in very rare cases where the discussion of a particular altcoin is exceptionally relevant to Bitcoin in some way). Plenty of altcoin discussion (usually mindless promotion) is removed from here every day, and if the user(s) responsible do not appear interested in contributing anything more than promoting/spamming/shilling their favored altcoins, they are indeed banned because that's not what this subreddit is focused on or about. 
BCH is an altcoin that is especially intent on promotion (being devoid of any technical merit) and in particular intent on a highly misleading campaign to pretend that it is "the true Bitcoin" (which it objectively is not), so we have to clean up a *lot* of content regarding this coin, but it's false to claim that this subreddit discusses this altcoin on a "constant" basis. We do not, and in fact submissions regarding BCH are (in the *vast* majority of cases) flagged as "altcoin" or "airdrop" submissions, allowing the bot to politely direct the user to a more relevant subreddit where their submission might be more relevant and well-received. If you see any submissions about BCH (whether positive *or* negative) that don't have to do with actual Bitcoin, and which haven't been flagged and removed yet, *report them to the moderators* so that they can be removed! It's that simple.


That is **exactly** what the moderation policies of this subreddit are designed to do, and a huge distinction between this subreddit and rbtc. We focus on Bitcoin, while they focus on us.

There's nothing wrong with increasing the blocksize. It was increased with Segwit, after all, which was a widely-celebrated upgrade.
What there **is** something wrong with is trying to force contentious consensus changes upon the Bitcoin userbase without concern for their consent or preferences on the matter, and it is especially bad if you try to bypass/ignore the peer review of the Bitcoin technical community when doing so.
The blocksize limit, and the approach that the Bitcoin community takes with regards to it, became a *governance* issue rather than a *scaling* issue. It is possible that this was part of Satoshi's original intent when implementing it as a consensus parameter to begin with.
We should both consider ourselves lucky and be very proud of the fact that the Bitcoin collective has managed to unite behind a scaling path which encourages efficient and optimized chain usage, adheres to Satoshi's design and architecture, and minimizes end-user validation costs and reliance upon counterparty trust. As a bonus, the path chosen seems to have spurred along the development and growth of (perhaps the first) truly useful decentalized apps (dApps) like the Lightning Network. It's awesome to watch Bitcoin smart contracts get used at significant scales.

It still seems like you don't really "get" the design of Bitcoin.

Ethereum was **not** described as a payment platform, though (re-read my comment above, where I pointed this out). And when they held their ICO, there was no functionality yet, no platform was built yet, and thus they were a "pre-functioning utility token" by any meaningful definition of the term.

No, "miners being able to collude in order to activate a backwards-incompatible consensus change" is **not** part of the consensus protocol of Bitcoin, and never has been. The whitepaper itself **clearly** refutes this directly:


chain. **Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes**, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. An attacker can **only** try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.](

Yes. In fact, that's exactly what I just did.


It is an uninteresting truism to state that "If everyone accepted counterparty trust in Bitcoin, then using Bitcoin wouldn't eliminate/avoid counterparty trust." That's obviously and self-evidently true.


Running your own node avoids the need to trust counterparties. The blockchain was designed to allow transactions to take place without the need to trust counterparties. The entire value proposition of a blockchain is that it allows this.
You are probably right that most "normal people" don't particularly appreciate the value proposition of Bitcoin (at least not yet). That's been the case from the beginning, and will continue to be the case for quite some time to come. All we can do is continue to spread knowledge, truth, and education to those who are willing to listen, and make our own personal evaluations on what is "worth it" to us (when it comes to investing, running a node, transacting, contracting, or anything else that has to do with a blockchain) and act accordingly.

That's the same question as "Why would Satoshi wish to remain anonymous?"
There are a few good reasons to do so. It helps to keep Bitcoin leaderless, it keeps him from danger or being unduly targeted, it allows freedom to express yourself without worrying about it being accidental Holy Doctrine, etc.
Also, privacy is a one-way function; once you give it up, you can never get it back. And with possession of the relevant private keys, Satoshi is capable of coming forward at any time... so in the absence of a compelling reason to do so, it is strategically optimal to remain pseudonymous (or "gone").

It's something for the developers of that particular implementation to be aware of, if they plan on extending their swap contract method to coins that incorporate smaller secret-size limits.

Not quite, but almost. The transaction isn't actually going to be any smaller, but it will have a smaller "weight" because its witness bytes (the signature part) will each only count as one weight unit (rather than the default *four* weight units per byte). Since there is no longer a block *size* limit and instead there is a block *weight* limit, the rational strategy for miners is to prioritize transactions according to "fee paid per weight unit", which means that you won't need to pay as much of a fee for a SegWit transaction with a lower weight.

One is a tweet shamelessly shilling an ICO. The other is a github commit that is (at least slightly) related to Bitcoin; the rise of "in-browser mining" has been being discussed recently as an alternative to the conventional ad-based models. 
Quit with the spamming *and* the trolling, please.

The rising block-confirmation demand (higher fees) had been going on for quite some time, and if anything, correlated with exponential price *growth* during the recent bull market.
Coinbase listing BCH correlated with the *end* of the rapid price growth. I'm not claiming it *caused* it, but it timed up with it almost exactly.

Honestly, it's nice to know that you are fully trolling. I had thought you were serious up until this comment. Usually I'm better at spotting you folk earlier in the conversation. 
In any case, for anyone else who didn't bother to click the link I gave and see what Satoshi actually says, here it is in full (it makes the troll above look particularly funny):










In case you missed it, that's a post where Satoshi talks about the obsessive lengths he went to, in order to make sure that upgrades to Bitcoin could be implemented as soft forks (though the term "soft fork" actually came later), because of how the core design was set in stone by the first version of Bitcoin (note: *not* the whitepaper). In other words, the exact opposite of what the troll is saying. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:15:26
Yes, and once again, *no one argues that this is the "goal" of Bitcoin*.
You certainly do love your strawmen, I'll give you that.

Over the long term, without a persistent backlog, there's a "fee sniping" risk, where it becomes hypothetically more profitable to "re-mine" at a certain block height, rather than working to extend the chain. As rational miners are a fundamental assumption underpinning Bitcoin, this would be a problematic circumstance.
In the short term, a backlog is an indication of actual, hard-to-fake demand (and establishes realistic economic expectations during this transitionary period of Bitcoin's growth). Also, in general, gradual shifts are better (healthier and less-lossy) than sudden shocks in economic systems.
A byte is eight bits of data. Most bytes of a transaction count for 4 "weight units" each, except for the witness data of Segwit transactions (which is the part that contains the signature or other "authorization proof"). These bytes count for just 1 weight unit each.
Technically, there is actually no longer a "block size limit" in Bitcoin any more (ever since Segwit activated), and instead there is a "block weight limit"... this means that rational miners actually try to prioritize transactions according to "fee paid per weight unit", since that's the most profitable way to pack a block full of data. This is a *very* little understood component of Bitcoin right now (partially because it's such a new thing, partially because it's so technical/confusing, and partially because some people deliberately try to misrepresent how it works, for political reasons).
Let me know if any of that was too confusing or poorly explained!

Keep on telling yourself that. Maybe you'll eventually even believe it.


Your "points" are literally this, verbatim: "You’re still demonstrating a lot of cognitive and emotional error in your posts. Confirmation bias, representativeness, etc." You haven't actually tried to demonstrate that this is true, you've just asserted it blindly. In other words, you've basically said "Nuh uh!" and not bothered to support your statement in the slightest. If you want to try, go right ahead. It should be fun to watch, at the very least.


Yes, the fact that copper is not gold is an "opinion" I hold quite strongly. Apparently your "opinion" differs on this point.


Now you're just contradicting yourself. You said earlier that **nothing** I had said was "fact or logic", moments after I said "Copper is not gold." I'm sorry, if you can't even keep your arguments consistent, that's that.


Again, this is (easily demonstrated) inconsistency. Your argument that "USD is like Bitcoin" is (and I quote, verbatim): "Regardless of the technology, the security, whatever, they have the exact same use... how is that not a substitute?" That is the entirety of your argument.
I already pointed out multiple things that Bitcoin can do which USD *cannot* do (just like USD can do things that Rai stones cannot do), but since your argument is that "they have the exact same use [and it doesn't matter whether they are exactly equivalent or have identical functionality in every respect], so they are necessarily substitutes" then you must admit that Rai stones satisfy this requirement perfectly well. Rai stones **are** like USD **in the exact same way that USD is like Bitcoin**; they are not the *exact same thing*, but they have the same use, and that is the only criteria that you have listed thus far for something to be a substitute of another thing.
Re-read the above paragraph until you understand it. *That* is how an argument is destroyed.


If putting "GOOD" in all-caps magically makes an argument sound, then I can just as well say "Rai stones are a substitute for USD, a GOOD substitute for USD." They can replicate most of USD's functionality. Granted, they can't replicate *all* of it, but USD can't replicate *all* of Bitcoin's functionality either. The argument holds equally well in both cases. That's the point.


Meaningfully depend on the fundamental properties of the protocol in the face of serious adversity.


Talk about creating a strawman argument! I guess if you can't beat the arguments that I'm *actually* making, make up a few, put words in my mouth, and argue against them instead! Again, following in the footsteps of your predecessors, I see.


What "very real issues" are these, precisely? I'm addressing everything you're saying, point by point. Meanwhile you're skipping over most of what I am.


A few more repetitions and I'm *sure* you'll have yourself convinced.

While it is being adopted, it is risky and lucrative. After it has saturated the market, both of those aspects will diminish considerably.
And this is fine.


Holding or saving Bitcoin **is** using it. In fact, during these early stages of growth, it is *the most rational* use of it.


Yes. Bitcoin is awesome. 


Yes, it can. You keep repeating this, but it doesn't actually hold up to any scrutiny, as I've been pointing out over and over.
Basically, you're struggling with the concept of price deflation in general. A deflationary (or in this case, disinflationary) currency creates no paradox, it just has different properties from an inflationary one. Yes, you should be less frivolous about spending or throwing around a money that tends to increase in value over time. No, that doesn't create any paradoxes.
A huge element that you don't seem to be "getting" is that Bitcoin's usage profile will evolve over time (just like the Internet's did; people weren't streaming videos in 1993). At first, it makes more sense to acquire and use Bitcoin for savings and investment/speculation purposes, because of its risk and return attributes. As it reaches "market saturation" levels, and has been adopted by a reasonable percentage of the final population that can be expected to use it, both of these will become less pronounced; it will be much less risky, and offer much less in terms of potential returns. At that stage, spending will increase, especially because it will be such a desirable money (relative to inflationary alternatives) that merchants will exhibit higher demand for it, offering discounts if consumers pay in Bitcoin rather than fiat.
You're overly worried about Gresham's Law, basically, but failing to consider the fact that the system is dynamic and that people will respond to incentives.

Just for the record, it's really hard to appropriately answer "ETA" questions when it comes to software engineering. The best strategy is to estimate how long you think it will take, and then *heavily* pad that answer to (attempt to) account for [Hofstadter's Law]( and then inevitably disappoint the person that you are providing the answer to because of how pessimistic your "estimate" is... and then perhaps miss the deadline anyway, double-disappointing them.
If they don't wind up giving you a direct answer here, don't take it personally; it's a lose-lose proposition from their perspective.

Bitcoin is very unique in this regard. It really adds to the mystique.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:03:23


False; not quite. But this is a good thing; we don't *want* an empty mempool. Ideally, it should always have a backlog of fee-paying transactions pending confirmation (at least a small one).


True, but you're better off paying 2 sat/byte if you want relatively quick confirmation (and *even better off* thinking in terms of satoshis per *weight unit*).


Not quite; more like "a couple/few cents" in most cases. With Lightning Network, fraction-of-a-cent fees are a reality, but Lightning Network, though functional, is still very young and in the "early alpha" or "experimental" stage.


False. This is overoptimistic and naive. We're making fantastic headway, and soon the Lightning Network will be reaching a "beta" (and then "production/gold") stage, which will allow anyone who cares about fast and cheap payments to get what they want on Bitcoin... but scaling is unlikely to *ever* be "solved once and for all", and even if it *does* reach such a state, the "debate" has progressed past the point where the truth actually matters to the Bitcoin-antagonists. They represent the new generation of Buttcoiners, and no amount of Bitcoin-proving-them-wrong is likely to get through to them; they'll just get more and more bitter (and ignorable) as time goes on.

@_date: 2018-02-20 18:15:13


In terms of transaction fees, that would probably be as good as it gets. Other than that, as few outputs as possible is what you're aiming for (because output data isn't witness data, and witness data counts for less weight than non-witness-data, also known as "base data").


That might be backwards, if my interpretation is correct. Witness data costs 1/4 as much as base data, so the higher the percentage of witness data, the less a transaction costs (per byte).


Absolutely correct, spot on. I'm surprised that wallets are taking so long to do this, in fact. I don't know of any that are yet.

Every single time Bitcoin rallies, people try to retroactively pin the explanation on some nefarious boogeyman behind the scenes. "It was all The Manipulator!" "It was all Willybot!" "It was all Tether!"
No, it was none of those things. Maybe each of those boogeymen actually existed, but none of them had the effect that conspiracists want to attribute to them. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, the best sound money the world has ever seen and the most revolutionary technological breakthrough since the Internet itself. It is growing, and the nature of the market hivemind is that it grows in cycles, fits and spurts. That means "bubbles" with an upward trajectory.
If your pet theory doesn't successfully predict these price movements **in advance**, toss it out. There is a theory that *does*, which no one has ever come close to being able to refute, which makes those who understand it very wealthy.

Blockstream is a company founded by a few Core developers, which has (at least so far) shown no signs of doing anything but contributing positively to the Bitcoin ecosystem. I am waiting to hear what your specific accusation is against Maxwell and/or Blockstream, but understand that if you come around quoting (many-times-debunked) conspiracy theories from rbtc, you're now talking to someone who can actually respond with facts and citations against such drivel.

First, you just changed the claim... that's called "moving the goalposts" and is actually a classic logical fallacy.
Second, **no**, Lightning Network is not touted as "the" solution to anything.

Marketcap is trivially gameable (*far* more gameable than "total fees paid"), and has been gamed past any meaning because there are incentives to do exactly that. I've written extensively on this subject before, but suffice to say: you can launch an ERC20 token with an arbitrarily high supply granted to the launcher, and sell a couple for $1 each, and suddenly have the largest marketcap ever seen in crypto. Getting listed on CMC-esque websites would require a tiny bit of effort, but consider the principle demonstrated beyond doubt at this point.
Marketcap is blatantly misleading, and not "fair" whatsoever. Calling it "good enough" is naive.

Bitcoin has value for many reasons. You're, again, just digging yourself deeper into that hole we talked about.


It can be (and is, and will continue to be) used as a currency. It can be used as a portfolio hedge (if you have any sort of finance background, the alpha and beta profiles of Bitcoin are a portfolio risk manager's dream come true). It can be used as a means of value storage. It can be used as a medium of communication and immutability, even.
Bitcoin is **money**, not just **currency**. You might think that those two things are exact synonyms, but again, that would be you guessing (and guessing wrong).

No, the point of bigger blocks is to orchestrate a social attack on Bitcoin enlisting every shining example of the Dunning Kruger phenomenon out there, yourself quite clearly included.
Bitcoin adoption is increasing, as proven by the strong bull market we've been in for *years* now, and we cheer it on all the time. In fact, your weird and obsessive anti-Bitcoin subreddit (rbtc) continually mocks this subreddit for cheering and meme'ing about Bitcoin adoption and price rising.
No one is cheering about a decrease in adoption over here. I mean, we couldn't be, because it's not happening. We're cheering about the fact that SegWit has reduced fees so dramatically, primarily because it has made it considerably more expensive for Bitmain&amp;co to spam Bitcoin when they incur the full opportunity cost of *not* mining their ASICBOOSTable altcoin (bcash) by doing so.
We celebrate the (at least temporary) cessation of a long-term spam attack. 
Big blocks don't increase adoption. Bcash isn't used at all, really. You chose the wrong side, bud, and all the smart people in the space are now laughing at you while you flail around ineffectually trying to rationalize things.

You should seriously apologize for this weird misrepresentation.
Firstly, a fee market has existed since (at least) 2012. Whether or not there is a block subsidy, you have been able to prioritize your transactions by including a fee payment *for over 5 years*. Don't be afraid of the free market and a little bit of competition.
Secondly, the engineers who you are implicitly accusing of "trying to make a fee market happen asap" are **the ones who have been working tirelessly to optimize the code and increase throughput and capacity and scalability, so that fees can be as small as possible**. If you are mad about the competitive transaction fee rates you've seen over the past year or so, direct your anger at Bitmain (who started a massive anti-SegWit campaign to preserve their ASICBOOST advantage, capping capacity at 1MB/block for far longer than it needed to be, and who regularly mine a disproportionate quantity of empty/nearly-empty blocks *even to this day*), direct your anger at Roger Ver (who has done the same things, and runs a mining pool that *still* will not include SegWit transactions or any blocks over 1MB in size, and which for some reason regularly mines very small blocks even when many transactions are queued in the mempool), and direct your anger at the spammers who have artificially inflated fee rates up until the Bcash opportunity cost of doing so became unconscionable (who are likely the same entities listed above). Do *not* direct your anger at the engineers and programmers who have done everything they can to increase capacity, safely, in a way that reduces the fees we have to pay *in both the short and the long term* because they bother to think these things through thoroughly.
You should seriously apologize for what you're insinuating here. If you are upset, blame those responsible for that which is upsetting you. Don't spin a false narrative like the trolls do.

No, he answered "how".
*Why* should the prices of the assets be correlated in the first place (such that arbitrage occurs at all)? That is a separate question entirely. Think of it this way: if someone showed us charts showing that the price of gold was intimately correlated with the price of potatoes, you might find that surprising. If you asked "Why is that?" then it would be unsatisfactory for the person to respond: "Arbitrage!"
So the question of "why" demands that we instead try our best to explain what causes the correlation to begin with.
My best guess at an answer is above: like it or not, altcoins basically exist in Bitcoin's shadow. They ride the coat-tails of the King, hoping for him to slip up, but all the while actually depending on him for any chance of significant success.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:52:07


Really, now? I said "Copper is not gold." You're telling me that's not a fact?
Apparently you are now arguing that copper is literally gold. This is the level of inanity people like you stoop to, *routinely*. Thank you for proving my point so well. 


It's more that "I put forth arguments that no one is able to counter, and then put my money where my mouth is, and have had those arguments validated *time and time again*, while my 'opponents' wind up deleting their comments and accounts out of shame."
By the way, when I talk about people having deleted their accounts out of shame after arguing against me, it's not a "single instance" sort of thing. There have been more than 5 accounts, *on reddit alone*, that have wound up doing so after having been embarrassed by me in arguments just like this one.


Because it can't do plenty of things that Bitcoin can, obviously. Can you memorize your USD private keys and waltz across any national border with the entirety of your USD-denominated wealth *stored in your mind*? No? Thought not.
Can you donate your USD to Wikileaks during a banking blockade? No? Thought not.
I can keep going, but I don't really need to.


I'm not joking, but I'm certainly laughing.


The USD is a substitute for Bitcoin in the same way that [Rai stones]( are a substitute for the USD. After all, "they have the exact same use... how is that not a substitute?"
But you're not going to acknowledge this point. You're not going to acknowledge that Rai stones completely refute your argument. You're going to continue sticking those metaphorical fingers in those metaphorical ears of yours. It's truly pitiable.


Again, you're not the first person who has resorted to this as a final, desperate resort; "you sound arrogant in your responses, so you must be wrong" is a non sequitur that is only ever said by someone who realizes, deep down, that they just lost an argument and have nowhere else to turn.
I don't have to curb my tone to preserve the feelings of those who try to argue against me despite not having put *nearly* as much critical thought into the subject of discussion as I have, especially when they repeatedly fail to acknowledge any of the points I'm making and get more and more hostile and defensive along the way. Frankly, your sensitive disposition is nothing more than an amusement to me, considering the circumstances under which our paths crossed. You showed up, said some dumb stuff that hundreds before you have said before (and embarrassed yourself in the process), ignored the helpful information I provided you, and now you're upset. Not much more needs to be said, so let's call it here and go our separate ways.

There's no "correct" answer, but your current strategy (known as "dollar cost averaging") is lauded in the Bitcoin community as a wise, low-stress, and historically *very* profitable one. Basically, the benefits are that you accumulate Bitcoin without worrying yourself too much by trying to "time the market", and assuming that the long-term trend holds up moving forward, you actually acquire a respectable stake and wind up outperforming the vast majority of day-traders when the bull market eventually re-materializes. The good news is, the dollar cost averaging strategy winds up netting you more coins at a lower cost-basis than most active trading strategies would; the bad news is, if the bull market somehow winds up never happening, you end up buying a continually-depreciating asset.
Personally, I think you have the right idea, and it sounds like you're playing the game intelligently. Of course, I am a stranger on the Internet who will willingly admit a heavy pro-Bitcoin bias, so take that with an appropriately-sized grain of salt.

While there exists a discrepancy between "the best that SHA-256d ASIC chip fabs can achieve" and "the best that *any* chip fabs can achieve", there are interesting economic implications. For instance, if you are able to produce "better than the best" Bitcoin mining chips, simply by virtue of being a big fish in a (relatively) small pond, there's a big incentive to actually *use* those chips yourself and mine yourself some bitcoins. While it does defocus your company a bit, and force you to play "two different games at once" (one being chip fabrication and the other being digital currency mining and speculation), you'd be able to get away with this for as long as you had an edge on the rest of the industry. However, if you reach the "Big Leagues" where the Fortune-500 companies are meaningfully involved and competing against you (and you're all effectively ramming up against Moore's Law together), it's going to be a *lot* harder to sustain such a diffused strategy, and more likely than not, competitors will take advantage of the opportunity to specialize and focus on *just* the chip fabrication side of things, "outsourcing" the actual mining to other players and actors in the market.
The gap has been steadily closing. Bitcoin chips are finally reaching the Big Leagues, and companies like Intel, Toshiba, Samsung, TSMC, etc will eventually be meaningfully participating in the field.
My comment doesn't have to do with the mining difficulty, it has to do with the economics of chip design and fabrication.

Look at LocalBitcoins volumes. Look at Bitcoin-related website hits and forum participation.
Heck, anyone who has been involved with Bitcoin can tell you, anecdotally, friends and family get interested during the bubbles, and ignore it or dismiss it during the lulls.
Adoption absolutely correlates to price. Intimately. You're lying to yourself if you pretend otherwise.

So the answer to my previous question was **yes**, you're totally just guessing.
Seriously, there has been *so* much analysis of Bitcoin volatility (I'm talking everything from websites to research papers to Reddit comments) and it has been dampening steadily as the market cap grows.

Is this the first time you have read this email of Satoshi's? If so, there are hundreds of forum posts and emails that you might be interested in reading, to learn more about how Satoshi thought about Bitcoin.
It is very clear that Satoshi intended Bitcoin to store (and ideally accumulate) value over time. He explicitly likened Bitcoin to digital gold on numerous occasions (even mentioning gold mining in the whitepaper). Heck, just read the last excerpt of the email in the OP's screenshot.
Anyone who is trying to argue that Bitcoin is **only** a store of value is clearly wrong; it's money, after all, and has a smart contract platform *built in* with the Script engine. But no one actually does seem to be arguing that, as far as I can tell, and it's mostly just used as a strawman argument by those who want to pump certain altcoins and spread confusion.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:27:10
Percentage of total nodes isn't really all that relevant when it comes to UASFs, that's just a strawman that rbtc liked to drudge up whenever possible, despite everyone else continually explaining and re-explaining that this is a lame and weak strawman (just like I'm having to do again, right now).


The only impact it was designed to have is "activating SegWit on August 1 at the latest". **That is it.** If someone told you that UASFs were meant to do anything more than that, they lied to you and you fell for it.
The concept of a flag day UASF is a game-theoretical soft fork activation model that relies on the backing of an economic majority. If the economic majority commit to the code, or if there is a reasonable market belief that they could or might, then the most profitable mining strategy is to adhere to the soft fork activation being demanded, because this bears you the least risk *and you know that the same holds true for all the other miners*. 
If the threat of the economic majority's backing is *not* realistic, then the miners do not necessarily have a strong game-theoretical incentive to enforce the soft fork. Importantly, it doesn't even require the support of a hashrate majority to render appreciable the risk of a chain takeover from the UASF side. That was the particularly powerful aspect of the game theory involved.
What happens in the scenario where the economic majority *doesn't* back the UASF *and* the threat of such isn't powerful enough to trigger the game theory implications mentioned above? The users running UASF nodes stop connecting to Bitcoin (and probably eventually give up and go back to running normal Bitcoin client software again).


No. SegWit was delayed because it hurts miners who heavily rely on covert ASICBOOST for their competitive advantage.
There are about 20 smoking guns on that one.

It's not. If you don't actually demand Bitcoin, you're not adopting Bitcoin. It's a straightforward, consistent, and reasonable argument.


That's equivalent to saying "Of course most merchants aren't going to adopt Bitcoin for now." It's essentially just blanket pessimism. You might be right, of course, but there are compelling reasons to actually adopt Bitcoin (hence the adoption we do see, which is what causes our periodic bubbles).


They'll *never* be able to use it to pay their expenses if the collectors of such payments don't accept/adopt Bitcoin. The ideal we're working towards is a closed-loop economy where this changes.


There are compelling arguments to adopt Bitcoin (for situations where censorship-risk is low, most of these arguments revolve around profits), despite the tax implications. Almost all of the accounting can be automated, and if you're paying taxes later (rather than *reducing taxes owed*), that necessarily means you made money via your adoption. Generally, the tax implications of *making money at all* are a hassle.


Most miners *don't* accept Bitcoin (they mine it)... though my understanding is that most professional mining operations do keep a portion of the BTC that they mine, which refutes the point I believe you're trying to make.
Again, **if they don't wind up owning BTC after all is said and done, there has not been any actual adoption**... this is effectively a truism. It should be fairly self-evident, in fact, if you think through a simple thought-experiment at the extreme end of things. Imagine that *every person on Earth* is willing to "accept" Bitcoin (i.e. instantly convert it to fiat and take possession of that fiat), but *no one* is willing to hold any BTC themselves for any length of time. The demand for BTC is nil in this example (as no one keeps a non-zero balance), and the price per coin will drop to **$0**. This scenario represents *zero* Bitcoin adoption, even though everyone is willing to "accept" it, proving the point rather handily.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:28:57
Actually, Bitcoin already lost almost 100% market share to altcoins when I launched thieflarcoin a couple weeks back. 100 trillion coins, sold one to my friend for $1, boom, I single-handedly took over almost 100% market share. Bitcoin lost that battle.
*Cumulative transaction fees paid* is a much better metric for "which crypto is actually valuable" than gameable metrics like market share (as calculated via "market cap").

This doesn't really make sense. He would have to be a sysadmin working at a Bitcoin mining pool, because clusters of anything other than SHA-256d ASICs aren't going to stand a serious chance of mining a *single* Bitcoin block, *much less* multiple in a row like this.

Newer isn't better, and [sidechains]( (and related or similar technology) are on the horizon.


It's clearly *pretty* private, since it's used on DNMs quite successfully and regularly. Sure, there are coins with better base-layer privacy, e.g. Monero, but Monero actually scales *far* worse than Bitcoin (and technically is continually inflationary). There are *trade-offs* incurred by baking in that privacy on layer one.
As for Bitcoin, there are many privacy enhancements in the pipeline, on a number of fronts. One particularly interesting proposition is that of [Mimblewimble]( being developed as a Bitcoin sidechain. This would allow privacy as good as Monero's, but in a much more scalable way.


It's actually pretty darn fast. The ten minute average block interval was chosen for a reason (orphan rate management). Satoshi could have made block times target 10 seconds each, but he *didn't*, and you will have to do some reading and thinking to understand why.
Also, the [Lightning Network]( is basically coming online right now. Virtually free **instant** transactions, at scale.


Yes, that's what high demand for a scarce resource will result in. That's not a problem, that's a reason to celebrate.


Nonsense. Wherever did you get that idea?


Good. The older it looks, the better. The thing holding Bitcoin back the *most* is that it's not already established as "money" in the minds of most people, and that it will take *years* and *years* for it to earn that title. Every day that goes by strengthens Bitcoin in this respect, because it just needs to continue doing what it's doing, to prove its worth.


Only to the extent that I spoke of above.


What "improvements" are you referring to? Litecoin ported SegWit over... is that what you mean? Ethereum sacrificed decentralizability and scalability for robust statefulness at the base level, despite the fact that without a perfect oracle this doesn't do you any good, and with a perfect oracle you might as well just use a Bitcoin multisig setup...
Neither of those coins offer any "improvements" over Bitcoin, on a fundamental level. They represent *deviations* from Bitcoin's design, but this inevitably translates to *trade-offs*. You have to spend some time actually thinking about and building software to truly appreciate this fact, but if you want to put in the hours, you will eventually realize the truth of it.


Judging from the rest of this paragraph/argument, this is probably just more "falling for the sales brochure" in action (no offense intended). Yes, there are a lot of altcoins, which are each self-described as "better than the best thing you could ever imagine"... but dig a little deeper and you'll start to see the *astounding* lack-of-depth to almost every single one of these projects.

I see that they *do* treat it as a "payment token" (and that the only reference to ETH in this document states that they're not reclassifying it), which is also interesting, but for different reasons. This is definitely remarkably inconsistent with the narrative and literature that was pushed so strongly for the first few years of marketing by the Foundation and their supporters; "it's not money, it's not supposed to function as a currency, it's a 'fuel' for the 'platform' and isn't even trying to compete with BTC in the 'money' or 'currency' niche at all!"
I mean, from their very own official [What is Ether?]( page:


Then again, their whole strategy has always amounted to "pivot whenever problems arise" so it's not like this is particularly surprising... though it's definitely strange how FINMA decided to classify ETH in light of the above.
If ETH is a payment token, it seems like "utility tokens" arguably don't exist.

I second what said, [johoe's mempool page]( is my personal favorite resource when it comes to fee estimation and wait times (though you do sort of have to "eyeball" and "guesstimate" a little bit)... but aside from that, I just wanted to say: **good job** for asking this question. It's a very smart thing to do; most people just assume that the earn.com link (or the wallet they use) is "correct" without bothering to double-check, which sucks because then they end up overpaying (and ironically encouraging others to do so, by accidentally and unnecessarily dragging up the "average fee" figure in the process).
So, seriously, well done! You're behaving more intelligently than the *vast* majority of people out there... even if it seems like a simple question, it indicates that you're smart enough to ask questions and dig a little deeper into things past the first glance.

It can absolutely hold true for a technology like Bitcoin.
Money itself is a technology; without it, the inefficiencies of barter would prevent the full benefits of *gains from trade* from being harnessed by the traders in question. The more efficient the monetary technology is, the higher proportions of these gains can be realized.
The fact that every bitcoin possessed by one entity means one less bitcoin is available to other entities does *not* imply that Bitcoin itself is a zero-sum game.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:55:43
That's true, they'll be able to "see" the next hop. But the hops after that will be less trackable to them; it could be you spending the coins on that "branch", or it could be the merchant.
Furthermore, if you bought a game for $25 (instead of $50) originally, it wouldn't be possible for the exchange which gave you your $100 of BTC to tell whether you spent $25 and got $75 in change, or spent $75 and got $25 in change. Or rather, it wouldn't be possible without external information (like knowing the merchant's address or something like that).

Yeah, that much is obvious. You're an anti-Bitcoiner (or "buttcoiner", if you will). 


If you care about usage, then go ahead and acknowledge that the Bcash altcoin enjoys a sliver of a fraction of the usage that Bitcoin does, and go ahead and acknowledge the fact that this proves that the morons' rallying call of "big blocks = big adoption" is total bunk.
Of course, you're a troll, so you won't do either of the above. You'll ignore the inconvenient facts and do your best to silence the cognitive dissonance that results from doing so.


The troll brigade, you mean?


You are attacking Bitcoin, because its design is predicated upon free market competition (and has since day one)? Hey, if you don't like Satoshi's design, you're free to leave it alone. No one is coercing you into interacting with the Bitcoin network.


Calling attacks what they are, and stupid people what *they* are, most definitely helps the discussion.

You have it totally backwards. *Core developers control Blockstream*, not the other way around.

Sure. This oughta be good.




Fair enough assumptions.


So, N=400000. That's going to be an up-front cost of somewhere between $40k and $400k. Alright, relatively expensive setup cost, but if they can profit $3M from it, then it is profitable in the end.


Uh, what? Here is where things start to get a little weird, and we start to see the argument devolve. "Due to lightning's flaws"? What flaws, exactly? If you're setting up 400,000 channels with one side staked already, that isn't a flaw in any meaningful sense of the word... that's just you establishing channels pathologically. Also, it's not "difficult to get paid at all as a new LN user"; this is a myth repeated by people who don't understand how LN works. You can be paid as a new LN user by just creating a Segwit address (which can initially be empty) and having another LN user open a channel with you; it's roughly the same level-of-difficulty that it takes to receive a normal (P2PKH) Bitcoin payment for the first time.


What partners, exactly? In order to open a channel with someone, either you're going to be funding it out-of-pocket, or you have to convince the counterparty to cooperate with you. Your EvilPathologicalChannelBot is going to have a hard time doing so... which is a glaring, gaping flaw in this "attack"; one might reasonably call this a *show-stopper*.


If I understand this section correctly, it is basically stretching that show-stopper above past any point of reason; it's trying to establish a context in which you've set up hundreds of thousands of LN channels with willing counterparties and nearly-emptied your own side of the channel, hoping that the counterparties involved don't bother to close the channels after you've done so and they've received what payments they can reasonably expect out of you. Since you're presumably anonymous as you orchestrate this attack, you've also somehow convinced these counterparties not to worry about the nearly-empty counterparty on the other end of their channels *while the network itself has hundreds of thousands of other channels exhibiting similar properties*.
This section is basically saying, "Ok, bear with me here... imagine you've convinced a bunch of people to take unnecessary risks involving you as a counterparty, without ever letting them know your identity, and at any point these people can eliminate that risk by simply settling up the channel state (thereby taking your money), and for some reason they don't, even though it's totally trivial and rational to do so... now we're talking!" To say this is *contrived* doesn't do it justice.


The math itself is relatively uninteresting (I'm not going to waste time trying to prove that a [double-decker bus *can* fly, after all]( though I will take a moment to note that the argument seems to be relying on large figures; despite the obviously-false initial claim that "the concept holds for nearly all cases", on smaller scales the attack doesn't work whatsoever, because there's space enough in blocks to accommodate the would-be victims' transactions. Meanwhile, on large scales (i.e. operating under the assumptions upon which this attack is predicated, when the Lightning Network is processing massive levels of transaction volume), a different input assumption (namely, that blocks are naturally/normally 75% full) is suddenly extremely questionable.
It seems like the intent here is to "throw some numbers into the mix to distract from the actual logic", which is something that certain communities are becoming more and more fond of these days.


Actually, after all is said and done, the maximum revenue the attacker could conceivably net is **4.4 BTC**, and that is assuming that they manage to *entirely empty out the Lightning Network* (i.e. it is under the assumption that their attack is magically successful in robbing every single Lightning Network user of their entire balance).
In an imaginary scenario in which this attacker is able to convince hundreds of thousands of users (who are currently not even using the LN) to enter into bidirectional payment-channel arrangements with them... without knowing who the attacker is or having some external form of recourse established... while also preventing (or more likely, just hoping against) those users from bothering to close out their channels as it becomes prudent (and, again, *trivial*) to do so... which would, of course, stop the attack in its tracks and result in the attacker simply *losing* their BTC that they tried to elaborately position for this network-wide attack... and without this having any sort of impact on the available/remainder block-capacity of the base layer, which is yet another means by which the whole scheme falls apart...
I guess this is an interesting thought experiment if you're really bored and don't mind how ridiculously far-fetched the setup is. As a plausible attack vector, not so much.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:06:14


It sounds like you should be supporting the BDPL and the usage of overt ASICBoost, in that case.


I have already addressed this (the disruption this is poised to cause is *positive* in nature, and the "inconvenience" is simply "not being able to deploy more than 65,000 soft forks simultaneously" which isn't a significant drawback at all).


Technically, *any* specs are "vulnerable to immediate deprecation by a trivial soft fork" because any blocks can be orphaned by a majority miner collusion. As I said above, evil soft forks *are* a concern, **which is, ironically enough, a reason why overt ASICBoost is a welcome development** (again, as explained above).
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:29:45
Yeah, I think that's a fair summary.
The idea is basically to double-spend after/while doing so via taking advantage of imbalanced channel states (publishing a flood of more favorable prior states, which at most risks the attacker's remaining channel balance(s)).

Definitionally speaking, it is the one that remains consensus-compatible with the version(s) that preceded it. In this case, that is (obviously) Bitcoin, and *not* any of the various airdropped altcoins (like BTG, SBTC, BCH, UBTC, etc).

Mainly it's because [he has a **long** history of lying]( has a lot of money which he has used to buy Bitcoin-related namespaces (like the "btc" subreddit, the bitcoin(dot)com domain name, and apparently the  Twitter handle, too) which he then uses as platforms to spread anti-Bitcoin propaganda in a weird and disturbingly antagonistic attempt to pump altcoins he is invested in. Oh, and the fact that he is a raging egomaniac plays into it, too (he has tried very hard to give himself the nickname "Bitcoin Jesus" but, as you can see, the Bitcoin community has completely rejected this attempt, for obvious reasons).
Finally, he's very vocal and outspoken, and relies almost entirely on populist, emotion-based appeals (which, as mentioned above, more often than not include provably false statements) and he tends to devolve into emotional outbursts (which sometimes include [blatantly-faked tears]( and other times include [ridiculous, unprofessional fits of rage]( surprisingly frequently.

I don't actually claim that. It would benefit those that hold that currency (relative to those that don't), but it could certainly have a net negative overall impact on the GDP (or perhaps even employment rates); if your metric of "benefit society" is "the higher the GDP, the better" then a strong case could be made for a deflationary currency running counter to that goal.


Bitcoin itself won't "justify" anything (it is a faceless, conscienceless protocol). The basic incentives involved will motivate rational economic actors to continue using Bitcoin (in particular, accumulating and saving it) for as long as it offers an especially attractive risk-to-reward value proposition... but that doesn't mean that it is "good" or anything like that. It just means it will continue to exist.


At this time, real.


I personally believe that prices being denominated in Bitcoin will be one of the last eventualities to occur during its growth and life-cycle (assuming that this ever even happens, which is a big assumption). Bitcoin is much more likely to exist *alongside* other, traditional, incumbent monies and tender, in particular because nation-states (and international organizations like the EU) want to be able to collect taxes in their own given fiat money for a variety of reasons.
Historically, most instances of deflation (at least in modern times when solid data has been available) have been caused/accompanied by problematic economic circumstances and troubles that serve as irritating confounding variables, meaning that it's tough to find empirical evidence regarding how a *healthy* modern deflationary society would look like. We can reason through it a little bit; like you said, anyone who took on a significant level of debt (denominated in the deflationary asset/currency) would suffer disproportionately, according to how severe that deflation turned out to be.
My personal answer to this "issue" is simple: *don't take on Bitcoin-based debts* (or more generally, *any* debts where the underlying asset can reasonably be considered or expected to be deflationary during the term of your debt). If you do decide to do so, make sure you get *very* attractive terms or rates, such that you do not wind up being blindsided by another growth spurt. If at all possible, denominate your debts in an inflationary currency, and your savings in a deflationary one. For as long as uncapped fiat monies exist (which, to my estimation, will be a *long* time yet), this will be possible.
Of course, the advice above will not be followed by everyone, no matter how good it is. But we can't do anything about people making idiotic mistakes other than try our best to warn against them. If someone wants to go out and get a Bitcoin loan without a robust plan for paying it back, that's a bad idea, and I will tell them so, but I can't make their decisions for them. If it's someone close and dear to me, I'll do my best to dissuade them, but if it's some random person on the Internet, after a few gentle suggestions, I'd probably get in a brief argument with them and wind up mocking them and moving on.
Again, to reiterate what I said above, I don't expect Bitcoin to be used as a unit of account for quite some time, and by the time it *is* used in this capacity (assuming it ever is), I would expect it to have saturated the markets that it is likely to saturate, and the price to have leveled off accordingly. 
In the "[diffusion of innovations]( theory (which [communication technologies in particular tend to follow]( this would occur during the latter stages of the "Late Majority" and from the "Laggard" phase onward, and this is when the Bitcoin price would likely "stabilize" to a degree, relative to its incredible volatility leading up to this stage. This is shown in the ["plateau" phase of this graph]( the ["mature technology" phase of this graph]( the ["laggard" phase of this graph](
After that, the price of Bitcoin *should* still grow over time (assuming economic output continues to grow), but not at stupidly-unsustainable and incredibly-unpredictable rates. That's when actual considerable levels of expenditure should most reasonably be expected to start taking place. Until then, I think it's premature to expect (or hope for) people to spend Bitcoin more than they have to, and we should instead treat speculative investment and niche-market support as the primary use-cases of the tech.
A lot of people (even extremely pro-Bitcoin users) disagree with the above assertion, and try very hard to encourage other Bitcoin users to "spend their coins to help the Bitcoin economy"; I don't think this makes much sense, considering how incentives are currently arranged. The whole reason Bitcoin works is because it *uses* human greed to its extreme advantage (in numerous ways); trying to fight against greed is a losing strategy, and fundamentally anti-Bitcoin.


At risk of repeating myself: I think prices will continue to be denominated in things other than Bitcoin for a very long time, *even* if Bitcoin continues to grow and be adopted at impressive or alarming rates.
Assuming we've reached technological maturity, and the price deflation levels have tapered off, and companies/services start to actually price things in Bitcoin, they would still surely change prices over time in response to deflation (just as they do now in response to *in*flation).
The biggest costs of this sort of price adjustment is with "sticky" things like wages, where employees are going to be very unsatisfied if their paychecks are adjusted downwards (even if it maps to an equivalent wage to what they were receiving before, after factoring in deflation). People like it when their gasoline costs them less units of money, but they *don't* like it when they are paid less units of money. The exact consequences of this are difficult to predict, especially because this is many years out *at best*, and society is hard enough to predict even with "normal" economics afoot.
If you have insights regarding what any of this would look like, I'm all ears, of course. I have spent a lot of time dwelling on such questions, but past a certain point, the answers get fuzzier and fuzzier until it winds up sounding like "Well things would look *different*, that's for sure!"

They could mine Bitcoin blocks using ASICBOOST overtly. They are choosing not to do so (they are still mining empty blocks -- actually more of them, proportionally, than they used to before SegWit activated) which is an indication that covert ASICBOOST is probably still being used... the bad news is that doing this foregoes fees and revenue, hurting their bottom line. So they are begrudgingly mining Bitcoin while enthusiastically mining Bcash (even when it is significantly below profit parity).
In other words: they're sticking with the "oh we wouldn't use ASICBOOST and those empty blocks are, like, our Satoshi-given right" storyline, while getting what they can out of their exploit-friendly hardware with their spinoff coin.


Opportunity cost. You can either point your (ASICBOOST-augmented) hashrate at Bcash, or at Bitcoin, but not both. They are apparently opting to point the bulk of their hashrate towards milking the Bcash cow for as long as possible. This means that any fee-paying transactions they make on Bitcoin will cost them, as the other miners happily gobble up those fees.
You can spam Bitcoin if you're a big miner while bleeding out *very little* in terms of fees. You can't do the same if your hashrate is pointed elsewhere.

This is the exact opposite of true.
The whole schism started when Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen said "Hey rather than follow the Bitcoin path that Satoshi had in mind (where transaction fees steadily replace the block reward as the primary mining incentive) let's instead drop that whole premise and instead rely on assurance contracts and altruism, where a single benevolent dictator (Hearn) unilaterally controls the codebase, and where ultimately fully-validating nodes are no longer affordable to normal users."
That is what the pitch of BitcoinXT was. You probably didn't even know about the "replace transaction fees with assurance contracts" bit, and you'll probably try to dismiss it rather than take a moment to verify it yourself and consider how radical of a departure from the original Bitcoin idea it represents.
In any case, *that* was the XT pitch. Everyone who had a serious understanding of Bitcoin basically united in opposition to this takeover attempt, while the gullible and shortsighted decided to splinter off into a counter-Bitcoin movement that continues to this day.
And you have the nerve to say that Core is supporting something contrary to the "original idea and vision"... you trolls are absolutely shameless.

Makes a lot more sense once you realize how meaningless "market cap" is as a metric these days.
To compare fair-launch coins against one another (which, from a quick glance at the "top" 30 coins listed on CMC, is basically comprised of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero) it makes some sense. For airdrops, premines, instamines, ICOs, etc (like BCH and EOS), it's just a big and virtually-meaningless number.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:10:51
Well, the BCH side is based on "trying to piggyback (or even steal) a brand name", preserving a particular miner-advantageous exploit (at the expense of users, decentralization, and protocol robustness), the willingness to sacrifice the ability to afford to run a node, and profiting proven liars and conmen.
It has (so far) exhibited a much more centralized and singularly-controlled development process (a single developer has decided every single major development decision so far, in almost every case against significant and vocal backlash from other developers who are trying to contribute).
It has a *much* smaller community (and accordantly a much smaller price and market cap), which is quite clearly defined by its antagonism to the *larger* community that Bitcoin itself enjoys. The BCH community is also highly irrational (demonstrably so), morally bereft enough to embrace outright lies and falsehoods, and notoriously prone to spreading conspiracy theories based around emotional-appeals; they are effectively a subset of militant trolls who are particularly adept at taking advantage of Brandolini's Law in every way possible.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is what it has always been: an antifragile engine of economic prosperity and growth, continually expanding as the world recognizes its potential and its stack (note: *not* just the bottom layer) is constantly being developed and refined by some of the best and brightest engineers in the world.

Okay, is it that you don't understand how bets and odds work?
That's fine if you like BestCoin more than Bitcoin, but *if you are not willing to trade 1 BTC for 1 BestCoin, you don't actually appraise its odds of being valued more than Bitcoin as more than 50%*.
The risk of the devs dying in a plane crash *is part of those odds*. In the end, whether you're worried about plane crashes or aliens or businesses revoking agreements, *you are valuing HypothetiCoins lower than Bitcoins*. This is perfectly rational, because *Bitcoins exist* and they are already valuable, whereas Bizcoins and BestCoins do not, and in fact *may never exist*.

False. See the [Wikileaks banking blockade]( or the financial censorship of donations to Edward Snowden or [other PayPal-related financial censorship]( or the [Cyprus bank bail-ins]( (and other similar historical examples) for cases where people have been prevented from using, accessing, or transferring the money that ostensibly belonged to them. See also: Darknet Markets.
You can't send electronic payments anywhere in the world today without Bitcoin (or something like it) because doing so requires centralized transaction approval that is (at least in some cases) not actually granted.
You can go ahead and try to move the goalposts now if you really want to, but your statement here is objectively false.


Also false. Bitcoin transaction finalization takes *minutes* (or *hours* if you want to be ultra-safe) whereas legacy financial transaction settlement and finalization generally takes *months*.
Of course, this is abstracted away from the direct user experience so that you don't have to acknowledge it directly in most scenarios and contexts, but it is the simple fact of the matter. Otherwise, chargebacks and other consumer-protection services simply wouldn't be possible. You have essentially fallen for an illusion (one which is possible to create in Bitcoin, too, of course, but which there isn't a particularly pressing demand or market priority for at the moment).
Furthermore, plenty of money transmission service providers charge percentages of the total amount transferred, whereas Bitcoin uses a (market competitive) fees-per-weight-unit mechanism that allows effectively flat-rate transfers no matter the total value being sent *and* payment-channel solutions that can reduce fees-per-payment down to virtually zero-cost without incurring custodial/trust-related risks or concerns into the mix.
So, again, what you have said here is false and indicates little more than ignorance on your part.


The same is true in the case of Bitcoin.


That entirely depends on the form that the funds take. History is rife with examples of national currencies collapsing *much* worse than "20% in a week", from the hyperinflation seen in the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, Russia, Venezuela, and countless others. This phenomenon has continued to occur all over the world to this day.
The "standard troll response" to this historical insight is to take the "No True Scotsman" approach, trying to narrow the scope of discussion to "big" currencies like the US Dollar... [but even that argument is bunk, and would mostly just show that you're historically ignorant](


This is **true**, because "collectible" just means "worth collecting; of interest to a collector" and Bitcoin definitely qualifies under this standard definition. Unfortunately for your thesis, this isn't a bad thing.


This is obviously false, as Bitcoin has facilitated plenty of trade (again, research Darknet Markets to learn more) and thus has provided direct economic value, whether you like it or not.


This is true of **literally anything**.


False, [by definition]( It is not a *national* currency, but it is definitely a currency (and a commodity, and a collectible, and a network, and a consensus protocol, and many many more things).


False, again [by definition](


Arguably fork/airdrops like BTG and BCH represented Bitcoin dividends.
Pretty much every claim you have made, and every "argument" you've put forth, has been completely false and just demonstrated how ignorant you are. You seem to be a bitter and jealous troll, which we have no shortage of around here, but you're not even bright enough to sound even *slightly* clever or mix in enough truth to make your comment more credible. I could expand upon the neat use-cases that Bitcoin allows which simply aren't possible with pre-Bitcoin tech (like the ability to *memorize a few words and store your funds in your mind* and then waltz across national borders easily, or to create and execute smart contracts that require no human arbitration whatsoever) but it wouldn't do any good, because you're not here to learn more and grow as a person, you're here to troll and spread misinformation.

For a non-Lightning payment.
Lightning Network (and other upper-layer solutions) allow us to reduce or amortize this to arbitrary degrees. Unicast payments allow effectively infinitesimal per-transaction fees to be feasible, both economically and technically.
But yes, if we're ignoring every other layer of the stack except for the bottom layer, something on the order of 1 satoshi per 100 bytes forms a sort of lower boundary for fees. I'm not sure how relevant of a figure this will ever truly be, though.

To get things other than Bitcoin, of course.
Take it to the extreme: would you rather I gave you a trillion dollars that you won't be allowed to spend (because it is cryptographically locked up) for 2000 years, or $100 today that you can spend whenever you want?
If you chose the $100 (despite it being so much smaller than the trillion dollar payout) then you have your answer.

Quick hypothetical: you decide to buy $100 of Bitcoin. Then you decide to buy a video game for $50 of Bitcoin. Assume that the merchant uses a one-time address to receive your payment, and you use a one-time address to receive the change from the payment.
Now assume that someone else wants to figure out what bitcoins you own. How can they tell apart the merchant's address from your change address, both of which received $50 from the payment you made? Without some other information to go on, they simply can't.
That's the idea in its simplest form.

As far as I am aware, the only reasonably big company that actually accepts Bitcoin is Overstock.
Other companies (like Microsoft, Expedia, etc) accept **dollars** through Bitcoin payment processors, rather than truly accepting Bitcoin.
The distinction is huge, because *actually* accepting Bitcoin represents true demand and a meaningful move towards a closed-loop economy, while allowing people to convert their BTC into dollars (which you then accept) at the time of sale is merely a fluid and easy cash-out option that represents zero new demand and no real progress towards a Bitcoin-based economy. For the consumer, there aren't really big advantages to paying with Bitcoin, either (even if you are using the spend-and-replace method there are solid reasons to use credit cards and dollars instead: Gresham's Law, reward points, and strengthening your credit score, to list a few) and it is unreasonable to expect for people to behave altruistically rather than naturally in response to the relevant incentives in place.
In short, spending your BTC through payment processors that just immediately cash it out and deliver fiat to the merchant arguably **hurts** Bitcoin more than it "helps" it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:52:13
Bitcoin is one big shared ledger, keeping track of who owns what coins. The only way we are all able to keep track of this without a central coordinator/authority is by agreeing on the rules of the protocol, and then following them (and ignoring the people/ledgers which don't follow the same rules that we do). When we are running compatible rulesets, we are "in consensus" with each other, meaning that we will end up with the same ledger state as long as we can connect and communicate with each other.
Anyone can mess with their own rules (no one can stop them from doing so), but if they mess with the "consensus-critical rules" then they're going to wind up with a different ledger result in the end, meaning that from anyone else's perspective, they basically live in another reality (and are ignored). For instance, you can modify your own ledger so that you have an extra few thousand bitcoins at your own address, and I have no way of preventing you from doing this... all I can do is keep following my own rules, and ignore you if you violate them. So if you tried to *spend* those bitcoins (which, from my perspective, do not exist), my node will just ignore you. Your ledger doesn't match mine, and is obviously not using the same rules, because what you're trying to do breaks mine. You're not in consensus with me, nor with the rest of the network.
So if you make a change that isn't compatible with the rules that the other Bitcoin users are already running, you are now running something that is not-Bitcoin. Being backward-compatible is what guarantees you to be still using Bitcoin (you're still "playing by the rules", so to speak). Our respective ledgers will continue to match, and we won't wind up in a position where you think you have a different balance than I think you do.
In the end, the *only* thing that Bitcoin is designed to do is to ensure that everyone winds up with the same ledgers (i.e. that there is a consensus on the balance of each address), without a central authority to control that ledger. Since it's in every individual's best interest to mess with the ledger to give themselves a higher balance, the only way that we can stay properly in sync with each other is to run consensus-compatible rulesets.
If someone makes a backwards-incompatible change to the consensus rules, even if they manage to convince *most* other users to go along with the change, any users that *don't* do so (e.g. because they don't like the change in the first place) are technically still using Bitcoin, while the people who went with the change are now running a new coin. It could still replace Bitcoin (humans are social creatures and language evolves), but it complicates matters because suddenly we have separate branches of the chain that different groups consider valid, where the address balances on each will end up diverging. In other words, this quite literally represents "Bitcoin breaking".
I apologize if that was too many words, or written in a patronizing tone (or anything like that). Just trying to boil it down to the best of my ability.

Roger Ver is a serial liar. A while ago I compiled together a [non-comprehensive list of examples of his lies]( which included things like claiming to be banned from a subreddit he wasn't actually banned in (and then accidentally posting in it), egregiously misrepresenting his trial (which has a public court transcript available to contrast against), the infamous case where he vouched for Mt.Gox shortly before it imploded, and actions/policies he has taken with regards to the website(s) he controls.
In a classic case of psychological projection, Roger Ver told [a string of lies]( while accusing Aaron van Wirdum of being a liar.
As you can see from the thread above, Roger is often presented information which he deliberately chooses to ignore or suppress. Another excellent example of this is the case where [a single user went out of their way to vandalize a subreddit]( (which was repeatedly explained to Roger), and then Roger tried to [misrepresent the episode anyway]( Yet another example of this is when Roger [flagrantly misrepresented history]( and was promptly made aware of how disingenous his depiction was, only to record [a video two days later which repeated (and doubled down on) the very same lie]( (as well as making more untruthful statements). Note that Roger conspicuously refuses to respond to or acknowledge the facts of the matter when they are brought to his attention; [here's another example of him doing the same thing after making an unsubstantiated claim]( (on a related note, if you were wondering what I was referring to in the first paragraph of the previous link, see [here]( this well-documented political overmoderation/censorship of rbtc is another subject I've been trying to ask Roger about and only ever get crickets in response).
On a more "silly" and "minor" note, he likes to make misleading post titles like "[What I (Roger Ver) think about OP_GROUP]( without actually saying what he thinks about the proposal (instead engaging in a blatant bait-and-switch where he goes on to make more lies about how their community has "free and open discussion" despite the fact that this is false; see the preceding paragraph to get a fuller picture and appreciation of this). On an unrelated-to-crypto note, he has gone out of his way to [defend dogfighting]( which isn't "dishonest" per se, but is reprehensible in another way.
He frequently makes directly-contradictory statements, like when he said ["I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC" and then two weeks later said "I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash."]( Note that even when he makes statements like this (which *cannot* both be true) he will sometimes try to retroactively qualify one or the other in an attempt at further deception; this represents [more lying]( In the same vein, his mining pool [signals support for BIPs that it doesn't enforce](
He repeatedly pushes the false (and destructively misleading) propaganda that "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash"; not only will he resort to [extremely childish images]( in the name of this cause (and [repeat the tactic like a broken record]( but [effectively sponsors it on the bitcoin(dot)com website and the rbtc subreddit (both of which he controls)]( to put the icing on the cake, the website was involved in [a "bitter dispute" between Ver and OKCoin which resulted from Ver's "suspicious activity"]( and [he most likely bought the subreddit in an under-the-table deal in direct violation of reddit's Terms-of-Service](
There are other times where his lies and misrepresentations are more subtle. [Take this post]( for instance; not only is he purposefully misconstruing a quote (which he apparently doesn't even understand the underlying logic of) and pretending that it is referencing an asset *which didn't even exist at the time*, but in the image/slide Roger created, he includes a screenshot of a **BitPay service fee** as if it is a **Bitcoin network fee** during a time period in which Bitcoin transactions using *1 cent fees* were being processed. It's almost impressive *how much* duplicity Roger was able to cram into a single slide.
Another ridiculous misrepresentation he tried to get away with was the time where he mocked Andreas Antonopoulos on Twitter, and then had the gall to [later claim he "made Andreas a millionaire"]( essentially trying to take personal credit for the donations that the community (and especially  provided.
He will [relentlessly promote the known scammer Craig Wright]( promoting links like [this one]( (where it is claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi and has possession of Satoshi's private keys) while saying things like ["In regards to me saying that Craig Wright is Satoshi, uh, **I have never said that publicly**"]( 
As part of his propaganda campaign, he'll shamelessly repeat untrue headlines like ["Bitcoin cash is surging as other cryptocurrencies fall"]( when the reality of the situation is that [most of the time, exchanging your BCH for BTC would have been far more profitable than not doing so]( and this has proven more and more true as time has gone on (another fact Roger refuses to ever concede).
He will [reference fake projects]( (which [do not exist, and represent nothing more than misinformation for trolls to parrot]( and gets [*extremely* emotional and irrationally upset]( when people use the phrase "bcash" to refer to BCH (despite being willing to repeatedly and aggressively misrepresent "Bitcoin" as "Bitcoin Core", even though the former is a network and asset and the latter is a software client and node implementation). Note that the video link just provided includes Roger Ver "rage quitting" from the interview with the quote: "I've never hired a single sockpuppet" which [has now been proven to be *another* false statement](
A long time ago, he also [abused his admin rights on blockchain(dot)info to dox (and fully publish) a user's information]( over a *$50 dispute* which was the result of *Roger accidentally sending the user BTC* and which had *nothing to do with blockchain(dot)info in the first place*. When the community lambasted him for this (obviously unethical) behavior, he locked and edited the thread to try to cover it up and sweep it under the rug. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for Roger's reputation), the incident is archived.
This isn't a comprehensive breakdown, either. [Others have compiled]( similar [histories]( of [Roger Ver lying]( and even *those* don't cover everything. There are tons of other examples where Roger Ver showed the world his true colors, and **they are ugly**.

Good post, but I'm not sure I agree with this bit:


I haven't seen any cryptocoins yet that have tech even *nearly* as good as Bitcoin's, and I spend a *lot* of time looking over different projects' source code.
To understand why Bitcoin's code is the way that it is, you have to go back to first principles and really think about the problem(s) being solved in a critical way. Bitcoin is hyper-scalable relative to almost all other blockchains, sports some of the strongest applied crypto the world has ever seen, and has a very "pure" and utilitarian design.
There has been a lot of fuss about blockchains which exhibit "rich statefulness" (which are interesting, but maybe not so economically viable in the long term) and DAGs (which unfortunately as currently implemented basically un-solve the double-spend problem when it comes to reliably establishing distributed consensus when value is at stake) but most of this stuff boils down to little more than complex cash grabs without fundamental value... and then there's privacy-oriented tech (e.g. ring signatures) which typically incurs pretty big tradeoffs in other areas, and which we will probably be able to reap the benefits of (in Bitcoin) one way or another.
But the above pedantry aside, yes, you've got it.

It was a way for them to *save face*, for the most part, because it was gradually becoming more and more obvious that they were initially **very wrong** to dismiss Bitcoin and the revolutionary potential it represents. Being able to say "Oh, I'm a fan of 'blockchain' but not 'bitcoin', it's *the technology* that is so powerful" was a way to camouflage their backpedalling from the original "Bitcoin is a joke/bubble/ponzi" stance. Most of this phenomenon was surely subconscious and almost none of these people actually had any clue what they were talking about, it was just a convenient, politically-correct way to string buzzwords together to pretend like they "got it" (which, of course, was transparently false to the few of us who *actually* did).

Thanks, but no thanks. Got a dream job elsewhere, surrounded by people who *do* value and understand good engineering. Meanwhile, everything I've seen out of Coinbase since then has continually lowered my opinion of the company and its culture.
Good job on finally implementing SegWit, though. Can't wait for BCH to be delisted, though I suppose we'll have to wait quite a while on that one.

There's an important insight that I had a long time ago, though, which I think is relevant here. It is basically the following: *be careful to distinguish between the macro and the micro perspective, when it comes to Bitcoin*.
What I mean by that is that *even* if we both agree that a Bitcoin-dominated world would lead to inefficiency and loss on the macroeconomic level, hurting society at large, that doesn't actually strongly incentivize either of us to avoid taking personal advantage of it ourselves. In other words, if you expect Bitcoin to hurt the world by becoming more and more valuable over time, *the rational response is to acquire and hold it*, even though you might dislike the net effect it has on society. After all, your expectations in this scenario are that it will prove to be a profitable investment, regardless of the inefficiencies it might result in for the world at large.
It's a tragedy of the commons, yes, and it's not something to celebrate. But the incentives, and basic human greed, mean that ***if*** you think Bitcoin will hurt the world by being such a deflationary money, then the correct thing to do, personally, is to squirrel some away.
There's a [very brief essay]( on this subject, which has a few good excerpts worth quoting: "Bitcoin adoption happens one person at a time, and this is true for potential attackers as well as the rest of us... Bitcoin tends to oppose organizations rather than people. Even someone who stands to lose from Bitcoin by not reacting to it, such as a banker or government agent, stands to gain a great deal by buying now... Thus, the agency problem with Bitcoin affects bitcoin competitors as well as Bitcoin holders... Nearly any government agent who begins to see bitcoin as a potential threat must also simultaneously see it as an opportunity. He, too, can invest in Bitcoin. And why shouldn’t he? Bitcoin may be a threat to his livelihood, but it may well be making him an offer he can’t refuse. How can an organization that stands to lose by the adoption of Bitcoin provide its members with a better opportunity for staying loyal than Bitcoin provides for defection? ... Even those who might resist the temptation to defect would have to think about the defection of his fellows... If such an attack would be unlikely to succeed, then buying now would be the only intelligent action. Regardless of whether he liked Bitcoin, it would be futile to continue pursuing a doomed cause... Potential Bitcoin attackers are in a Prisoner’s Dilemma... Bitcoin attracts inside men to act as covert saboteurs."
You get the idea: ultimately, Bitcoin works via grassroots, bottom-up growth. This is unlike anything that came before it (I'm setting aside that which came *after* it, i.e. other cryptos, for the time being, because it's a separate subject from this one), and it's a *very* powerful aspect of it.


...unless they were self-interested and it offered a significantly more attractive value proposition than the alternatives. Right?
Thought experiment: *ceteris paribus*, assuming that *everything* else is equal, would you rather keep your savings in inflationary-dollars, or deflationary-dollars, if given the choice? 
(I know that "ceteris paribus" is an unfair assumption and granting an awful lot, but for the purposes of this particular thought experiment, it helps to demonstrate the principle directly.)
The only reasonable answer here is "deflationary-dollars", of course. Of course, Bitcoin isn't as good as dollars in a lot of ways (most importantly, the size of the network of users), but it *does* have that "killer app" of "tends to go up in value over time, instead of down", and then a few other nice properties on top of that, to seal the deal.
It's *not* a guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to perform like it has performed so far, and similarly there is no guarantee that a widespread government clamp-down isn't just-around-the-corner. It seems less likely as time goes on and more and more laws and regulations arise *around* Bitcoin, but we can't rule it out. But the gap between "network size" is gradually (and sometimes not-so-gradually) diminishing, and over time as liquidity improves the volatility discrepancy is likewise diminishing (believe it or not, [this actually seems to hold true]( on mutli-year timeframes)... these are the primary competitive advantages that USD offers over BTC, and both are becoming less prominent; meanwhile, the advantages BTC offers over USD are getting *more* prominent as the technology and infrastructure improves and matures.


You wouldn't, unless it crossed some threshold of temptation for you (offering to improve your quality of life in some obvious way). The big driver of growth is (so far), as I've said, speculation... which has proven lucrative for the majority of speculators/investors so far. Another driver of growth is niche markets (like darknet markets and censorship-prone payments, both of which do not work with traditional monies)... but I would argue that these drivers are becoming less and less relevant as time moves on.
You will probably dismiss the analogy as flawed for some reason or another, but it really is appropriate, in my opinion: the same sort of statement could have been made about email in 1992. "Take my own view, for example. I'm fine with traditional mail - I have plenty of stamps, don't correspond all that often and have had all my needs satisfied with the postal service. Why would I support any change with an upfront cost of implementation (especially if I don't have an expensive, awkward computer or Internet connection already, and don't have interest in programming)?" In 1992, email was barely starting to take off, and for most people, it *didn't* have much to offer relative to snail-mail. Twenty five years later, it's hard to imagine getting by without it.
Bitcoin might not be for you (or for most people) right now, and not even die-hard believers generally try to argue that it is. We are looking at the technology's *potential* (and honestly, there is *a lot* of it), and we're thinking many years (or decades) out, trying to see past today and into the promise of tomorrow. Bitcoin lays the foundation for many exciting new possibilities, whether you've personally looked into them (or even considered them) or not. I said earlier that it represents a "quantum upgrade to money itself"... this might sound like the ravings of a lunatic, but again (and pardon the repeated analogy): imagine what a nerd in 1992 would sound like when trying to describe how awesome of an impact the Internet would have over the next few decades. They would sound similarly insane.
Maybe Bitcoin doesn't end up succeeding like the Internet has. So far, it seems to be doing rather well, though.


I really don't see why not, though. Especially if we continue denominating prices in the inflationary currency; if that's the case, what exactly is going to stop the deflationary currency from continuing to exist (and grow, as more and more people respond to the natural incentive of "wanting more money over time" and its viability is proven via continued survival)?

Just as an example (and I don't think this is a good idea, and we should do our best to avoid soft forks like this, but it demonstrates the point quickly): we could create a new set of consensus rules with a higher limit, and then require each normal Bitcoin block to only contain a maximum of *one* transaction (the coinbase transaction), which includes the Merkle root of a *different* block that uses the new rules.
Old clients would not be able to see the new block, and to them it would look like Bitcoin only processes one transaction per block (which would be weird and perhaps frustrating), but they would not see any consensus rules being violated, and wouldn't be forked off the chain. It would be a perfectly valid soft fork, in other words. Meanwhile, anyone with a modern client would see the new, second block that the first one links to, which has an arbitrarily high new weight/size limit.
...and there you go. Soft fork limit increase.

Part of the non sequitur, you mean?


It seems like you're the one missing things here.


Not quite; this is another example of something *you're* missing, amusingly enough. Usually when quoting a section of a reddit comment, it is to provide context for the next statement(s) you make which address it directly. This technique doesn't require a *full* quote, just enough to make it clear what you're responding to in any given section of a comment. Here's an example:
**Alice:** I like dogs. I don't like cats. Dogs are almost always sweet, but cats are often mean. When it's nice outside, I like to play fetch with my dogs. Do you have a dog?
**Bob:** "I like dogs"... well, me too, Alice. But I *also* like cats. "Dogs are almost always sweet"... yes, but that makes it a little bit less special, in my eyes. If a cat shows affection, it feels extra nice, because you know you've *earned* it, whereas dogs are often indiscriminate with their love. "Do you  have a dog?" Yes, I do! Two, in fact. I also have a cat, and love all my pets.
Notice how Bob didn't quote the "I don't like cats" and "but cats are often mean" excerpts, or the part about fetching? He didn't need to, and in fact, it's a little bit more natural of a response as a result. It's clear that Bob's reply covers the different statements that Alice made, even though he didn't copy every single word she said into it. Alice mentioned that cats are mean sometimes, and a very stupid reader might jump to the conclusion that Bob "selectively read" over that part... but someone who was a little bit brighter would see that Bob's response was appropriate and that he was well aware of Alice's perspective, and in fact that what he said and brought to the dialogue actually addressed that point perfectly. 
You might want to think about Bob and Alice in this little example for a bit.


Do you know what the phrase "non sequitur" means? I suggest you Google it.
The "default enable" approach suggested above is not a fork of any kind. When you ask a question about soft forks (or go on a tangent about explorers displaying Segwit transactions), it just shows that you don't understand what you're responding to.
You're fumbling around foolishly and (quite amusingly) throwing weird accusations at those around you as you do.

You don't need to take my word at all, as you can see direct **proof** of my claim by the fact that, in the linked thread itself, I provided the results of the comparison. I mean, I literally *compiled together numerous links proving the claim*, which is what the thread itself represents. There's no need to take my word when the proof is already provided, and served as the foundation of the very thread you're linking to.
I have a simple question for you: will you ever provide me comprehensive financial records for you and your family? Yes or No that's all I want. My answer is the same as yours is, whatever that may be.
Of course, the only evidence we have against you being a human trafficker is *your word*, until you provide those records. We're supposed to take the word of someone like you, someone willing to treat humans like livestock or mere commodities? Continue avoiding the accusations, continue failing to provide *any* sort of evidence in favor of you *not* being a human trafficker, and prove my point.

This article is posted by a well-known troll, and doesn't even *slightly* resemble a "mathematical proof" as it claims to. It has been debunked numerous times, but it's important to realize that the "can anyone debunk this?" question is a bit like asking: "Can anyone debunk the claim that Bitcoin is just one big Ponzi scheme?" Yes, we can, and plenty of people have done so in plenty of different ways, but the question itself is generally indicative of either trolling or severe ignorance (so it's generally frowned upon).
In any case, see the following for a few examples of rebuttals/debunkings:
* [Simulating a Decentralized Lightning Network with 10 Million Users]( this piece alone is definitive, because it demonstrates empirically that Fyookball's "proof" is anything but.
* [Murch's response]( which explains how broken the argument is *before you even bother looking at any math*
* [A response to Jonald Fyookball’s article “Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution”](
As Murch once excellently put it: "Consider this anology: We're discussing airplane designs for optimal transport capacity per fuel usage. Fyookball presents his model, an omnibus. He complains that his math shows that the doubledecker bus doesn't fly at all. Would you check the math or critique the model?" and later: "Fyookball's article is useless because it builds a strawman and torches it. It simply doesn't properly describe how LN works."

It doesn't matter what price coins reach, it won't magically make your mining profitable when you assess the opportunity costs of doing so. You have to use electricity to mine coins, and that electricity costs money. If you're looking to invest, just buy coins with that money instead (it's far more efficient and you will get more "bang for your buck"). 
In any case, you wouldn't be able to mine even a fraction of a bitcoin with a general purpose computer these days. You can go buy a dedicated Bitcoin miner (an "ASIC") if you want to mine, but again: *if you are concerned about profit at all, this is not the way to go*.

Atomic swaps allow you to trade across blockchains which have different tokens sporting variable floating prices; sidechains allow you to use tokens *pegged to Bitcoin's price*, effectively granting all the powers of the sidechain to *bitcoins* themselves.
So, for instance, you will be able to atomically swap LTC for BTC, but if you do it today, you'll be exchanging at a different rate than if you did it a month from now. With sidechains, you'd be able to swap at deterministic rates (usually 1:1), meaning that you can basically "enable and disable" features for your bitcoins, without fragmenting investment in the space.
The key difference is that it gives all the powers of any altchain to Bitcoin itself, meaning that an investment into Bitcoin effectively represents an investment into *all possible cryptocurrency*. It's a profound and powerful idea, but implementing the peg itself in a perfectly trustless way is non-trivial, to say the least.

The answer is pretty much "as much as possible" and *without a doubt* "more than we have right now". And yes, smaller blocks *would* be much better, in terms of decentralization potential. There are trade-offs to making the limit *too* small, of course, as I mentioned in my final paragraph above.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:10:12
Yes, such a crazy coincidence that the miners all suddenly became so interested in activating SegWit "from their own volition" after so many months of refusing to signal... and so convenient that they did so in time for the UASF flag day that was set. Three different times, on three different coins.
What would have happened is a chain split, of course. *If* the UASF chain ever overtook the other in cumulative work, it would have wiped it out (the reverse not holding true). It is an asymmetric game; that is the critical point.

No, replay protection only makes sense if you want to protect users against accidental loss of funds.
There is absolutely no way to make it impossible for the other side of the fork to survive. You cannot force users to run code of your choosing; that is the entire point of Bitcoin.

If all users of Bitcoin disappear (and don't come back, and aren't replaced), Bitcoin will die.
If all developers of Bitcoin disappear (and don't come back, and aren't replaced), Bitcoin will die.
If all miners of Bitcoin disappear (and don't come back, and aren't replaced), Bitcoin will die.
Fortunately, none of these are realistic possibilities, because the incentive structure that Bitcoin represents pretty much wholly precludes any of them from happening.

You're doing exactly what I just mocked. "*You already trust, though!*" Perhaps try re-reading my comment with this in mind.


Is Bitfinex some almighty authority that decides the definition of Bitcoin? We could just as well take Gemini's definition to prove the opposite point.


That's not "what we see here", that's an assumption you're hastily making.


Sounds like you might be quoting two separate people and conflating them together mentally. "Person A said X, but Person B said not-X! Aha, I've spotted a contradiction!"


Perhaps if you state things as if they are facts, you can convince *yourself*, but you're not doing a good job of convincing anyone else.


According to Craig Wright, he is Satoshi. Quoting known conmen as authorities isn't a strong argument.


You didn't cite two experts, you cited one conman and one expert.


That's right, you don't.


As I've explained (multiple times now), I fully understand the "weak subjectivity" argument. If you're under the impression that repeating it enough times will suddenly convince me of its truth, I don't know what to tell you. 


Or "dispute this", but what's a misrepresentation or two among friends, eh?


And some people thought Dorian Nakamoto was Satoshi. That doesn't mean that the identity of Satoshi is "weakly subjective", nor that the false beliefs of these people were valid. But hey, if this is uncomfortable for you to acknowledge, by all means, refuse.


In many cases, the official site is yet another scam. But yes, altcoins *do* tend to pale relative to Bitcoin when it comes to pretty much anything relevant to the underlying value proposition of a blockchain.


The problem (it seems to me) is that you're forcing words in my mouth. If you really want to argue against a strawman, I don't really need to be here for it. Do it privately, please.


A bit of an overstatement; I'm unaware of *any* successful eclipse attacks being executed in the wild. If it were "extremely vulnerable" then surely there would be a long list of documented attacks and victims to this particular exploit.
In practice, if you can connect to *any* nodes not controlled by the attacker, you're golden. An extremely low bar to get over.


Ironically, *you're* the one getting religiously overzealous here. "I'm right I'm right can't you see that I'm right?!? Roger Ver will tell you Bitcoin is something other than Bitcoin, doesn't that prove my point?!?" Frankly, you sound a bit desperate... so it's a little bit funny to see you calling *others* "religious" when it comes to subjects you obviously can't keep your cool about.


More strawmen. Seriously, have these conversations with yourself elsewhere. I don't need a notification each time you come up with a new imaginary opponent to argue against.


"I'm right I'm right can't you see that I'm right?!?"


Well at least you admit it! This is a big reveal, because Bitcoin is designed *entirely* around eliminating trustiness. Sounds like you don't like Bitcoin's raison d'être (which is fine), but don't be upset that those of us who *do* aren't that impressed with your arguments that revolve around *rejecting this goal from the start*. We're trying to do something different; you're not into it, that's fine. But relax about it, and quit getting all religious about it!


You did include it as a reference, but you didn't actually seem to appreciate the insight(s) it offered. Oh well. I'll read your paper in more depth later (you certainly aren't stupid, and the paper looks good, even if you *do* get a little frothy when things don't go your way in a casual reddit conversation).


Ah, that's about what I expected.
Not willing to bother understanding arguments that run contrary to your own beliefs; sounds an awful lot like "religious zealotry" in action!


Just the central thesis.

Lightning is a global network, so asking "where is it" is like asking "where is Bitcoin" or "where is the internet"... it's anywhere that the nodes are.

Personally, I'd recommend Electrum or GreenAddress, but both of those are for Bitcoin and don't include serious altcoin support (which I'm betting you want, considering the two wallets you mentioned).
I don't know as much about the multicurrency wallets, unfortunately, though I believe Coinomi is open source and supports a bunch of coins. Exodus and Jaxx are super popular and user-friendly, so you might end up just sticking with one of them purely for convenience, but I would be very hesitant to store/manage your life savings with one of them. For smaller/medium-sized amounts you probably don't need to sweat it as much.

Price is a function of supply and demand. Always. In any market.
If you bring a significant new chunk of demand to the table in a market where supply is fixed or predetermined, it's going to have an effect on the price. That's how it works.
You can do things (like spreading your buys out on multiple different exchanges, and trickling them in rather than executing them all at once) to make the effect less pronounced, but at the end of the day, if you want to buy up a bunch of bitcoins, you're inevitably going to be driving the price up, at least in a small way.
In this specific scenario, you simply **can't** buy 30,000 BTC through Coinbase. You can't even buy 1000 BTC through them. They don't offer that sort of available supply through their broker service. Try it yourself (go through the steps to place such a buy order), and you'll run into a limit at some point. This limit is orders of magnitude lower than 30k BTC.
At the time of the first US Marshals Auction (there were 3 or 4), when Draper bought up all 30k available, bitcoins were a bit above $600 apiece, meaning that the "market rate" for such a buy, factoring slippage out, would have been about $18M. It's more likely that you'd have to pay significantly more than $20M to actually acquire a sum like that at the time, even if you did things carefully and OTC rather than "on-market".

Bitcoin is subject to DDoS attacks all the time. If the client you're trying to bootstrap can't withstand a DDoS attack, sorry, but that's a problem *you* need to sort out.
Also, discussing things is not forbidden on this subreddit. Promoting contentious hard-forking clients (which would fracture the consensus that Bitcoin is designed wholly to induce) is against the rules, and thus not tolerated here.
For the record, the moderators of rbtc remove comments and posts that *do not even break any subreddit rules*, without explanation, *all the time*. Whenever you try to bring it up over there (even if you provide [direct proof]( people don't want to talk about it or acknowledge it, and instead inevitably try to change the subject to discuss *this* subreddit, instead. When this is [brought up to Ver]( (to debunk yet another of [his lies]( he invariably refuses to respond.
The subreddit is a [cesspool *pretending* to be a bastion of free speech]( run by a [narcissist who is a full-blown enemy of Bitcoin](

It's good to realize that we *can* swap out the Proof of Work algorithm, if needed. But there isn't anything even remotely resembling consensus (or even majority support) for such a proposal... calling it controversial is a massive understatement.
Furthermore, it's possible that the SHA-256 ASIC playing field is finally nearing a point where things will start to get more "level", so this is a bit premature, in my opinion. Let's give it a year or two, and if things get worse rather than better during that time, we can revisit the subject.

Every time I review the mod logs of rbtc, I see plenty of cases of the moderators removing comments and posts that they don't like (the most common infraction is to use the word "bcash" without supporting the coin, which will almost always ensure your post is removed manually by a mod).
Just a couple days ago, [I threw together a list of recent examples of this happening]( adding to *another* list I had compiled together a month or two ago. Note: this is not the result of intensive analysis or anything, both times were just cases me taking a ten-minute glance at the recent mod logs and copy-pasting the examples to a text document. It's an everyday thing over there.
The most unsettling part is what happens when you try to bring this up (to highlight the blatant hypocrisy) over there: the entire subreddit springs to the defense of the moderators, claiming that the removals are justified and inevitably trying to change the subject to discuss *other* subreddits' moderation policies. Almost always the argument goes: "These are obvious trolls" or "Bitcoin Gold is an obvious scam (though I can't really explain exactly how), so it's off-topic and mentions of it should be removed" or other such glaring inconsistencies. It's very interesting to watch them desperately flip-flopping in such obvious ways as soon as they *dislike* the removed content.
Bottom line: rbtc moderators remove content and ban people (even users and posts which don't break any rules) all the time. If you want to say that the rBitcoin moderation is "censorship" then you necessarily must admit that the rbtc moderation is also "censorship" (and from what I can tell, the situation actually appears to be *worse* over there, with mods removing posts based on their own political opinions or ideology, with no explanation and the removal reason of: "spam").

The percentage of Segwit-using transactions doesn't matter like you seem to be assuming it does. You don't get bent out of shape over the percentage of P2SH payments, do you? Use Segwit if and when it makes sense for *you* to do so, and don't worry about what others are doing.
The same is true for Lightning Network. Truly appreciating Bitcoin's decentralized nature means recognizing that *you* hold the power: the power to run a full node (or not), the power to retain sole possession of the private keys (or not), the power to retain reasonable economic privacy (or not), and the power to use/adopt any new Bitcoin technology (or not).
It makes no sense to worry about specific percentages of others' transaction formats when plenty of blocks aren't even at capacity.

Oh boy. This is, to put it lightly, *not even slightly realistic*.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:36:56
Read the first sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper:


This is the problem that Bitcoin solves. 
There is *not* a "more efficient and sensible" way to solve this problem than with a blockchain (or at least not one that I'm aware of). I didn't claim that Bitcoin is the only way to store value trustlessly and without risk of censorship (it's not; gold works too), but you *did* claim that "the only real use for blockchain technology is for a censorship resistant, trustless store of information" which is false, and I've explained *precisely* why it is false. 
In other words, you're arguing against a strawman, whereas I'm actually directly debunking what you claimed.
Once again, *general information doesn't suffer from a double-spend problem in p2p contexts*. Try to take a moment and understand what I'm *actually saying*, my friend. 


In what way? Most early Bitcoin skeptics that I read *didn't take the time to understand the design of Bitcoin and the value it provides*, and rushed to prematurely dismiss it. For instance, I remember a lot of articles making fun of how there were "only 21 million coins, but there are 7 billion people, I guess the dumb nerds never realized that there aren't enough coins for people!"... which just indicated that the author(s) of the article(s) hadn't taken the time to learn that bitcoins are highly divisible. The authors didn't understand the technology they were trying to criticize, even on a basic level.
In contrast, I'm here, explaining *exactly* why your claims are bunk, and I have years and years of research and well-reasoned arguments to back up what I'm saying. So far, your *only* argument has been "Well you sound like an early Bitcoin skeptic!" without actually supporting your claim. I could just as well say "You sound like a Nazi!" and my claim would make just as much sense as yours does. Notice that I'm not doing that, though.
If you have an argument, do your best to make it. The [survivorship]( and [strawman]( fallacies don't qualify as real arguments, though, so you're going to have to try something new.

You might want to check the numbers again, buddy. F2Pool dropped out a little while ago, and now you're working with outdated figures.
And that's not to mention the fact that we know the signaling is fake anyway, and that miners mine what is most profitable (which, judging from all futures prices available, will remain *Bitcoin* and not B2Xcoin).
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:44:45


No, not quite. The consensus rules dictate validity. The strongest chain within those consensus rules (where "strongest" is defined by "most cumulative proof-of-work expended) determines the canonical chain, but *not* validity. From [the whitepaper](


If there were no validity requirements outside of "proof of work" then there would be no 21M coin limit, because any miner would be free to violate the consensus rules which establish that limit (or any other limit, for that matter).

Look around you. The majority of the community is *strongly* opposed to an unnecessary, political hard fork. 
You will dismiss this fact by saying "Oh but that's just and it's a moderated echo chamber so we only get to see one side of the debate!" That is what is known as a *No True Scotsman* argument; you are discounting the opinions of everyone who disagrees with you, so that you can pretend like the engineers who have built Bitcoin into what it is today are "pretty much the only ones objecting" to your favorite hard-fork flavor of the week.
In *every* public poll, on *every* market (whether an ephemeral and ad hoc offer to trade or an actual exchange with a futures market in place), on *every* node counting service, in *every* development-related metric, the community support is *overwhelmingly* in favor of Bitcoin. The economic majority clearly does *not* want a rushed and haphazard (and *technically unnecessary* even according to its strongest proponents!) fork to double the base block size. You can shove your fingers in your ears and bury your head in the sand all you want, but quit with the lies about Core being "the only ones" on the community's side. Everyone who has taken the time to understand Bitcoin is on Bitcoin's side, *not* just the Core developers.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:21:12
Plenty of comments of his over there don't even mention Core, and just bash Bitcoin directly. Upvoted heavily every time, of course. In fact, I don't believe I've ever seen him downvoted to negative karma over there.
And that's all ignoring the fact that in terms of tech, Core *is* Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:42:38
Core isn't really a "team" like you're imagining. It literally *is* anyone who has worked on the Bitcoin consensus protocol or reference client.
Some people contribute more regularly than others, and some people do so casually. The regulars are generally what you probably think of when you imagine "Core" but really, the umbrella is a lot more inclusive than that. Gavin Andresen was a part of Core (but by no means the "leader" like he used to pretend), for instance. He stopped actively contributing, but could always do so again if he were so inclined.
But the bottom line is, Core is a lot bigger than just a couple of guys with commit access. It literally *is* everyone who works on the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:00:41
$5 is way overpaying; for most transactions $0.06 or less is sufficient. Try it. You can get 2 satoshi/byte transactions confirmed reasonably quickly today. The "$5 average" is not relevant to what *you* have to pay for a standard transaction, because it is heavily skewed by the inclusion of huge batching transactions from exchanges and services, and naive fee-estimation software.

@_date: 2018-02-24 21:11:43
Also (at risk of providing you an excuse to again dodge the references), I'll answer your final question:


In and of itself, not necessarily. I can come up with a few trivial proof-of-work algorithms that I would be the only one able to provide valid work for, which (of course) means that these types of algorithms are centralized.
However, in the case of Bitcoin, we have empirical evidence (I hesitate to term it "proof" though others might well do so) that **yes**, the network is decentralized: it has resisted all attempts (even when the attempts are seemingly backed by a supermajority of network hashrate) at top-down exertion of control. In other words, all incompatible consensus changes (i.e. hard forks) have failed so far, *even* S2X. If the network were truly centralized under majority-hashrate control (as you are apparently asserting), the explanation for this failure ought to be an interesting exercise in mental gymnastics to witness.
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:47:03
The other way around, actually.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:53:56
Deflation is not actually a "serious known economic problem", though it can exacerbate certain economic problems if it occurs in the wrong sort of context and it can arguably have a negative impact on certain metrics commonly associated with "economic health/success" (e.g. GDP and unemployment rates).
Of course, these metrics aren't *actually* objective measures of success or prosperity, as both can be [absurdly inflated to an arbitrary degree in a number of obvious and silly ways]( and in my personal opinion, the utopic ideal we should be striving for as a society is **100% *un*employment**, though of course that's a ways off and the rub is getting from here to there in a healthy way.
Bottom line: the simplifications (and in some ways propaganda) that you learned in your high school Intro to Economics class aren't the end-all-be-all of economic truth, believe it or not.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:38:43

@_date: 2017-10-01 17:26:07
It's not our fault that you don't even slightly understand the nature of antifragility.
Bitcoin isn't magically antifragile because of a few thousand lines of C++ code. It's antifragile because of the incentives that code sets up, and how *people* respond to these incentives.
One of the ways that people respond to these incentives is by telling their friends and family about Bitcoin, and spreading the good word. Another type of response is building cool Bitcoin-related products or launching cool Bitcoin-related services on the market. Another type of response is defending Bitcoin in random forum arguments online. Another type of response is trying to push through pro-Bitcoin legislation so that governmental agencies respond as positively as possible to this disruptive force and movement. Another type of response is suing people who try to attack Bitcoin in illegal ways.
None of these responses are in any way immoral, nor are any of them unexpected if you properly understand incentives and the fact that the world isn't going to magically change overnight. You can shout yourself hoarse saying "Anyone who runs to the government isn't really a Bitcoiner and they should be ashamed!" but all you're really saying in that case is "I am naive and clueless, and I don't have the slightest idea how things work in the real world."
Relax. People will do what they do. Don't hate them for it, just do your best to understand them and their motivations. Respond accordingly.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:14:28
You don't need an extra incentive to spend money... why would you? The incentive to spend money is *wanting things other than money*. 
If everyone is afraid to buy things (other than what they need) because of a fear of missing out on future gains from holding their money, then wow, that money is awesome and demand for it must be exploding (proving the point rather well). Hooray for society, at that point.
And of course, if that is happening, it means that adoption of Bitcoin is continuing to grow; once it has been fully adopted, the future gains that anyone stands to realize from holding their coins are exactly equal to the rate of economic growth in society (which is as fair of an equilibrium possible).
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:41:19
I'll do an itemized list of the points you have deliberately refused to acknowledge, then.
1) Bitcoin adoption is increasing, as proven by the strong bull market we've been in for years now, and we cheer it on all the time. In fact, your weird and obsessive anti-Bitcoin subreddit (rbtc) continually mocks this subreddit for cheering and meme'ing about Bitcoin adoption and price rising.
**Please acknowledge the fact that all of the above is correct.**
2) No one is cheering about a decrease in adoption over here. I mean, we couldn't be, because it's not happening. 
**This disproves your original claim. Please acknowledge this fact, and apologize for your untruthful statements.**
3) We're cheering about the fact that SegWit has reduced fees so dramatically, primarily because it has made it considerably more expensive for Bitmain&amp;co to spam Bitcoin when they incur the full opportunity cost of not mining their ASICBOOSTable altcoin (bcash) by doing so.
**Please acknowledge the truth of this statement, and admit that SegWit's activation has had a remarkable impact in terms of reducing average competitive fee-rates on Bitcoin.**
4) We celebrate the (at least temporary) cessation of a long-term spam attack.
**Please acknowledge this spam attack, and the fact that it has (not so coincidentally) stopped right after SegWit activated and the bcash opportunity cost became a serious consideration for the spammers.**
5) Big blocks don't increase adoption. Bcash isn't used at all, really.
**Please acknowledge this fact, which AGAIN disproves your original comment, and apologize for your misleading and untruthful statements.**
6) If you care about usage, then go ahead and acknowledge that the Bcash altcoin enjoys a sliver of a fraction of the usage that Bitcoin does, and go ahead and acknowledge the fact that this proves that the morons' rallying call of "big blocks = big adoption" is total bunk.
**Please, again, acknowledge this fact and apologize accordingly. Admit that "big blocks = big adoption" is a stupid and empirically disproved hypothesis.**
7) Of course, you're a troll, so you won't do either of the above. You'll ignore the inconvenient facts and do your best to silence the cognitive dissonance that results from doing so.
**Please acknowledge that I was completely correct in my prediction here.**
8) The troll brigade, you mean?
**Please acknowledge the fact that we have conclusive evidence of mass-scale brigading from the rbtc subreddit and the company you associate with.**
9) You are attacking Bitcoin, because its design is predicated upon free market competition (and has since day one)? Hey, if you don't like Satoshi's design, you're free to leave it alone. No one is coercing you into interacting with the Bitcoin network.
**Please acknowledge the fact that Satoshi designed Bitcoin such that network incentives are sustained by transaction fees (established in a free and open market) over the medium and long term, and then apologize for the fact that you have pretended (lied) about this not being the case while alleging that it is somehow an artifact of the post-Satoshi Core developers' contributions.**
Finally, please acknowledge the fact that you *have*, without a doubt, been ignoring all these points that I've been making, and pointedly refusing to acknowledge a single one.
A cowardly troll would refuse to acknowledge all the facts laid out in this comment, even after having them repeated like this. Someone who is *not* a troll would do the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:33:26


For a backwards-incompatible consensus update, there needs to be unanimous agreement on the specifics of the change in question, or else a chain split is likely to occur in which the identity of each side is in question. The *entire* point of Bitcoin, the *one* thing it is designed to do, is to prevent loss-of-consensus (like what this would represent), and to ensure that *one* authoritative ledger state exists and is programmatically identifiable. So a split like this would represent Bitcoin "failing" at the one thing it was built to do.
Note, also, that the BCH "split" does *not* represent Bitcoin failing as described above. Instead, that is clearly identifiable as an *altcoin* launching, where Bitcoin itself continues forward and maintains a single coherent chain and consensus state. So what has actually happened is that Bitcoin has *succeeded* despite the attacks it was subjected to by a minority subset of its users/community.
Furthermore, technically speaking, a hard fork is able to change *anything* about the system, including the 21M coin cap. If the system were easy to hard fork, it would effectively be worthless. I understand that this is counterintuitive at first, but if you spend a lot of time thinking about the valuable properties Bitcoin exhibits relative to alternative systems that came before it, you'll realize that many (if not all) of them derive from a particular form of immutability; if the system could be changed arbitrarily on a whim, there's not really much advantage to it being decentralized at any given point in time, because this can (quite trivially) be stripped or circumvented by a long (perhaps infinitely so) list of (in many cases seemingly benign) changes, and once it is truly centralized, there's no real chance of it reverting back to an uncontrolled and valuable state.
So that's why hard forks, in principle, are not as trivial as you might initially expect, and are "a big deal" especially when they involve a controversial change.
I already linked you to a comment explaining why the *specific* hard fork proposals that have been made thus far were rejected (to summarize: they were *all* quite obviously terrible proposals, and eventually every one of them was proven so).
Note, however, that the blocksize limit **was** increased, with Segwit. The old 1MB limit was completely removed from the consensus code, and was replaced with a new *weight limit* (4M WU, to be specific, which translates to an effective 3.7MB limit if you're still measuring things in bytes, which you probably shouldn't be).
So, again, realize that the limit **was** increased.


As I've already pointed out, Satoshi added the limit in June 2010, and continued making code updates for many months afterwards. It was *not* the last change he made to the code (far from it), though if you mean to say that he left it in the consensus code in the final version of Bitcoin that existed when he stopped actively developing for the project under the "Satoshi" pseudonym, yes, that's correct (and it should serve as a clue that maybe he considered it more important than certain people might want you to believe).


He didn't actually say that; in fact, he *never* publicly explained his reasoning for putting the limit in. If you try to find a direct quote from him on this subject, you'll eventually realize you cannot. It's actually conspicuous how he avoided explaining his specific reasoning for adding the limit in place, because it was a source of controversy even when he was still around and openly discussing it.
You have fallen victim to misinformation campaigns and false propaganda, it seems. Go ahead and try to find a direct quote if you doubt what I've said. Good luck.


That is false. The minrelayfee was added a few months *after* the blocksize limit was.
I have already provided links to both, so it is unclear why you are trying to lie here.


Note that Andreas pretty clearly aligns in the "pro-Bitcoin" camp these days, and that most in the BCH community consider him a "scammer", a "sell-out", a "shill", and even "human scum" (to list a few recent epithets from memory).
Note, also, that Bitcoin has most definitely taken the route to best enable poor/disenfranchised people all over the world to be able to harness (and afford) the power of a money free from government corruption. Trying to sustainably support a global economy on a self-validated broadcast system is a bit silly, in terms of network design; a unicast solution (and/or a stack-based approach) is quite obviously (to any network engineer, at least) the sanest and most efficient approach.
Basically, if we want sound money and we want it to support affordable transactions over the long-term, that will require an entire *stack* of well-engineered technology. Like it or not, that's how big and complex networks or systems work (and for good reasons). The stack won't be finished overnight (on the contrary, it will take many years to come to full fruition), but it's in the works as we speak, and as I already mentioned, some of the best minds in the world are toiling away at it in the background.

The Wikipedia entry is accurate and also supports the claim that Roger Ver is lying.
Signature data is not part of the txid hash in SegWit transactions. It is still serialized with the transaction and included in blocks along with the rest of the data.
Roger's description is inaccurate because the signature data is absolutely included in the blockchain,  is absolutely included with the transaction it is a part of, and it is absolutely used during blockchain validation.

Recently Chaincode has actually had a much larger presence in terms of Core contributions than Blockstream (paying John Newberry, Matt Corallo, and Alex Morcos, who are 3 of the top 5 contributors in 0.15.0).
The MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Chaincode, BCC, Ciphrex Corp, Metaco, Digital Bitbox... there are many companies that finance Core development.
I am surprised you fell for the "evil Blockstream controls Core" conspiracy theories without ever taking a moment to Google the facts of the matter. 
Core is a decentralized group of developers, *not* a company. I know it can be hard to wrap your mind around a decentralized movement like Bitcoin, but you should try to get in the habit of doing your own research so that you can begin to do so.

Politics, mainly.
36% of miners are still signaling *Unlimited* support (which is wholly incompatible with NYA/S2X). If you take miners' signaling at face value, the math doesn't even add up, and you run into a direct contradiction (130% &gt; 100%). 
If you subtract that 36% off of the NYA figure (because this portion clearly doesn't actually represent serious support, in light of this contradiction) then **only 59% of hashrate remains**. If you also factor out F2Pool (who said they are signaling but won't actually run SegWit2X when the time comes) this figure is **less than 50%**.
Considering that miner signaling is the *one* metric all the S2X supporters are most proud of, this paints a pretty ugly picture. No wonder SegWit2X futures are priced so low and no one is willing to trade BTC for S2Xcoins.

And I just explained how the entire concept of the UASF has apparently gone over your head.


You mean *other than the fact that it was 100% successful*?
That's the entire point: you can't satisfactorily measure economic support *other than* by making the market decide. The UASF is simply a way to force that to happen by a certain date.
It was successful, because the only goal was to have SegWit activate on August 1. That happened.


The impact of the game theory I'm describing *is* the NYA. 


The UASF was 100% successful on all three coins, like I said earlier.

...or were you just trolling, trying to prematurely dismiss numerous citations at once via fixating on a single quote from the first in the series that basically says "Now, we can't know *for sure* that this was a deliberately-orchestrated attack (even though that's exactly what it looks like)..."?

The success of the UASF prompted the mining conglomerate that is covertly using ASICBOOST to spin off their own coin where the exploit is still possible, which created real opportunity costs to spamming Bitcoin, and rendered it no longer cost-effective to do. 
We users started realizing the benefits of SegWit as soon as bcash forked off; notice how the spam stopped pretty much overnight, and average transaction fee rates have plummeted accordingly.
Just because you haven't figured something out doesn't mean it "makes zero sense"; try asking more questions and you'll have a much easier time figuring this stuff out.

No... no, not at all. From the whitepaper:


chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.
The "attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest
chain" is in reference to a 51% attack, in case that wasn't obvious.
The security model of Bitcoin is *much* stronger than you seem to appreciate.

The whitepaper only mentions SHA-256 once:


hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
In other words, the whitepaper seems to indicate that the specific hashing algorithm doesn't particularly matter, just that it exhibits useful work-proving qualities, and SHA-256 is used as an example of an algorithm that fits the bill.
This was later confirmed by Satoshi even more explicitly, when he openly discussed how the proof of work algorithm in Bitcoin could be replaced in the event of the network needing to do so.

Erik, it's a bit concerning that you *still* haven't acknowledged [the comments I made ten days ago]( which fairly comprehensively lay out why *your own reasoning on the subject* represents an excellent case for why to *oppose* SegWit2X.
I have been trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here, but that is becoming more and more difficult as you continue to support S2X despite your own arguments making such a strong case against it. It seems more and more likely that you are deliberately avoiding the recognition of the uncomfortable truths that I have tried to politely point out... and this begs the question of what your motivations truly are.
I still don't want to assume that you are trying to attack Bitcoin and its community, but every time you chime in supporting S2X despite the fact that your only arguments for why you ever did so *now represent arguments for why you should oppose it*, it worries me more and more.
Previously you dodged the issue by saying that you were "busy" but is this really a valid excuse, when the blog post that I went through represents the *only* defense of the S2X fork that you have ever made, and you continue to regularly support said fork in public while mercilessly attacking those in the community who do not?

Right, no bank can do that either. I mentioned that in my previous comment.
Bitcoin is special because it allows you to take actual control of your money, such that you don't have to worry about whether the bank (or Coinbase) is able to "pay out" when you want it. If you don't take advantage of this, realize that you're taking a very real risk, and if you end up suffering from it, you're mostly going to hear "Yeah, we warned you. Not your keys, not your coins." Many years ago, Mt. Gox was considered "the safest Bitcoin exchange" and it seemed unfathomable that they could ever wind up spectacularly insolvent... believe it or not, even after it started exhibiting withdrawal issues on the fiat side of things, many people were *still* arguing that "Don't worry, it's Mt. Gox, they are as good as it gets in the crypto world." From the perspective of someone who has been involved in this sector for many years, you sound surprisingly similar to those who came before you.
Coinbase is relatively easy for newcomers to use, indeed. They have a number of issues, though, if you spend a little bit more time doing research into the matter. Their upper management has exhibited gross incompetency in a number of respects (and are likely currently being investigated on insider trading allegations), their engineering department and technical architecture are notoriously substandard (which is a huge red flag when it comes to this industry, because proper security is *hard*), they have made some *very* big mistakes in terms of UTXO management which could hypothetically render huge portions of their coins inaccessible (which, alone, could cause insolvency), they have made a number of highly questionable business decisions and political maneuvers (none of which have proven fatal *yet*, but which certainly don't inspire confidence in their future), they have one of the least responsive and most-backed-up support departments in the industry (just stop by some time to catch a glimpse), and though I could keep going here, hopefully you get the idea.
The niche that Coinbase currently fills (easy on-ramp for newbies) has secured them a solid foothold, that's true. But they are far from perfect, and if you really try to tally up all the warts and red flags, you'd be surprised how many you wind up finding. I'm not saying "Don't use Coinbase/GDAX" but I *am* saying "Don't think of them as a risk-free, too-big-to-fail company, and *don't* keep too much of your holdings on their platform."

I like how "optimism" is a given... :)
Bitcoin will continue growing, like it always has. We have a bear market on our hands, it seems, but trying to guess when (or at what price) it will turn around is a fool's errand. "Why" it will turn around (i.e. what's fueling my perspective here) is the same logic that has been at play since the Genesis Block: Bitcoin is a quantum upgrade to money itself.
When the next bull market (and the bubble it will inevitably result in) does materialize, it's entirely possible that it will be the one to finally ["cross the chasm"]( which would be... well, *exciting* to say the least. [Hyperbitcoinization]( is a more realistic possibility than most people seem to realize or admit.
But perhaps we're still a few years out from this sort of thing. It's tempting to be overoptimistic once you understand the stakes that Bitcoin is playing for (and how beautifully things have been shaping up so far), so it's wise to keep your expectations in check along the way. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and don't expect to get rich quick overnight or anything like that. Stay smart, keep the "worst case scenario" in mind, and remember that patience is wisdom.

These two sentences contradict one another. The first indicates that you understand the tokens, the second indicates the opposite.


Yes, indeed, because the BT2 future token *represents the fork not canceling and instead succeeding in replacing Bitcoin*. If that doesn't happen, the token which represents this *is* worth nothing, *by definition*.


What do you mean? The BT2 token represents *the fork occurring and succeeding*. If it doesn't occur, the token is worthless. **By definition.**

Discuss hard forks if you would like, but don't try to promote them unless there is overwhelming consensus for the update. To date, no hard fork has achieved anything even close to that.
The typical troll response to the above is "Well how can consensus be achieved without discussing it first?" and the obvious answer is: "Either through actual technical channels (i.e. not reddit, obviously) or through open (even reddit-based) discussion that isn't trying to prematurely promote the backwards-incompatible change before contention can be gauged!"

It's annoying that well-financed attackers are willing to go to such effort to try and accumulate power from "within"(ish), but not really a serious threat. Ver and Wu made their play, and overplayed their cards. The market is punishing them for their insolence as we speak (BCH is considerably down relative to Bitcoin, in every single meaningful metric there is).
They have a strong foothold in the mining space, a strong foothold in various Bitcoin-related namespaces, a vast war chest of funds that they are only gradually working through, fingers in lots of Bitcoin-related companies' pies, and an absolutely jawdropping lack of moral integrity. These assets have been irritating to suffer the effects of, but at this point it is clear that they are losing serious sums of money via opportunity cost, and the market doesn't actually consider them to be a serious contender for the Bitcoin brand whatsoever, so they've been losing social capital hand over fist (Ver especially), which will be almost impossible to recoup.

In all cases where "the math" has been done, it has lead to the same conclusion: a block limit *lower than 1MB* would be best for decentralization at this stage. If node counts appeared to be organically rising along with the price and general adoption, it would probably be a lot less controversial (and easier to coordinate) a blocksize limit increase beyond that which SegWit has already achieved.
Of course, trade-offs must be made. Many of us have accepted the admission of larger blocks on Bitcoin, despite the centralizing impact this clearly has (easily understood *a priori* but also demonstrated empirically by now), because throughput is important, too. But it isn't a free lunch.

I plan on hosting an altrustic "I'll watch your channels for free" service, myself. Just submit your most recent channel-state and if it supercedes the previous "most recent state" that I've seen for that channel, I'll overwrite the old one.
By my estimations, this will cost me next-to-nothing beyond what I'm already paying to run a full node, and honestly, giving back to Bitcoin is something I'm always trying to figure out ways to do. If I can single-handedly kill one of the biggest criticisms of the Lightning Network (or come reasonably close to doing so) at very little cost to myself, heck, why *not* do so?
The best part is that no one has to trust me at all in this setup; I don't have the ability to do anything more than "have your back" in case your counterparty tries to scam you.

That is one of at least twenty ways in which they are incompatible.
Consensus is far more precise than you seem to realize. Consensus protocols require *very* strict adherence to rules in order to be reliable. Unlimited and 2X have incompatible rulesets (in a great number of ways).
Please do not try to "guess and argue" when it comes to technical matters like this. It can only serve to confuse and mislead.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:19:43
We *do* have to agree. That's the nature of consensus protocols. Without agreement on the rules of the protocol, no network is possible.
Of course, people are free to leave and try to establish their *own* protocols with different rules. And they do so, all the time. The only thing that anyone here objects to is *trying to pretend like your new protocol is the original protocol and trying to name it "Bitcoin"*.
If these people would just quit trying to steal the Bitcoin brand, no one would fault them. But that is apparently too much to ask.

This is quoting Satoshi, not "quoting Satoshi" (though he is *on* as he quotes Satoshi).
And what do you mean by "play that game"? Satoshi was a vocal advocate of [soft forks to upgrade Bitcoin]( (and strongly [discouraged hard fork attempts]( any time they were brought up), he continually [strove to keep Bitcoin as transaction-centric and lightweight as possible]( (*consistently* [rejecting and discouraging patches that tried to increase the blocksize limit]( he was also [adamantly opposed]( to [out-of-consensus Bitcoin implementations]( He believed that [any hypothetical hard forks should *only* be performed with long lead times and with extreme precautions taken to ensure that the changes are uncontroversial, **needed**, and safely adopted by the full network before being activated]( preemptively agreeing with almost every modern Bitcoin developer on the issue. He explicitly said that the blocksize limit *wasn't* an attempt to limit transaction spam on the network, and that [the minrelayfee was the "first try" to do so]( months later. He also explained that [hashrate doesn't define validity, and that no matter *how* much mining power someone has, they are not able to dictate the consensus parameters of Bitcoin](
All of these stances echo the sentiments and beliefs (still) expressed by the Bitcoin community, especially in Bitcoin-friendly forums like Anti-Bitcoin subreddits (like rbtc and rButtcoin) regularly misrepresent Satoshi, so if anyone should be avoiding "playing that game" it would be the trolls from those parts.

It also says 30% of blocks are mined by Unlimited (EC) miners.
Obviously you shouldn't put much stock into noncommittal coinbase-text-only signaling.
But to answer your question directly: yes, that is based on wrong information. You are missing the fact that miners can put anything they want into the coinbase text, and that multiple mining operations who currently include the "NYA" text have actually publicly stated that they are not following through with 2X.

There are no counterarguments other than political ones. I am totally willing to acknowledge other opinions and sides, but in this case *there aren't any other sides*, technically speaking.
There are **no** advantages in waiting until the last possible moment before disconnecting incompatible peers. **None!** There are multiple advantages in disconnecting beforehand and allowing the network topology to "prepare" for the fork.
Are you able to appreciate the preceding paragraph? Do you understand it?
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:14:08
If you're going to be leaving commentary on the subject, *please* actually [read the reasoning]( involved; there are *many* good reasons to disconnect well before any hard fork actually occurs, and really *no* advantages in not doing so.
What you think is "just a dick move" is a prudent and well-reasoned decision, which isn't really controversial at all on a technical level. The only reason there's any hubbub whatsoever is that there is virtually *zero* actual user or community support for the btc1 fork, which Silbert&amp;Garzik are desperately trying to pretend away, and this straightforward engineering decision hurts any effort to do so. This apparently pushed Garzik into a form of political retaliation (as one might expect), and here we find ourselves.

Where's the actual source data? These charts really look like someone is out to pick some cherries...
It seems fairly obvious that cryptos are  coupled to Bitcoin because it is, essentially, the one doing all the heavy lifting. Bitcoin is revolutionary, and represents a "cryptographic sound money ideal", and has driven the sector since its launch. Altcoins (yes, even your personal favorite altcoin, no matter how special you may think it is) have been riding Bitcoin's coat-tails and basically piggybacking on its brand-name since it started seeing adoption. News articles, headlines, soundbites, and any other type of exposure inevitably follows the "XYZ coin, which uses blockchain (**the technology powering BITCOIN**), is doing something or other..."
Most people don't recognize the other coins' names except in relation to Bitcoin, and whether you like that fact or not, it's the reality. The "market cap" metric is easily (trivially, even) abused and gamed, and most new altcoins these days have (essentially) central corporations with marketing/PR departments and advertising budgets that put out fancy sales brochures and press releases, whereas Bitcoin is a truly decentralized, messy, grassroots, from-the-bottom-up phenomenon which doesn't have some official agency representing it. These factors combined have given many people the mistaken impression that Bitcoin is in some way fading in relevance and that altcoins are "taking over" or "technically superior" or any of a hundred different similar perspectives; really, Bitcoin is still the reason why alts have any wind in their sails.
If you're looking for an answer to "why do altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin's movements?" then Tether is not the answer. Tether isn't in the driver's seat on this thing.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:48:05


This should serve as a huge clue for you to dig a little deeper and try to figure out *why* Bitcoin exhibits such unique behavior. Hint: "it's the blockchain, not Bitcoin" is a red herring. Hint: money is a technology (a network technology, at that). Hint: whether or not nation states would benefit from a modern deflationary/sound monetary standard, *individuals* certainly would, *if and only if* the option were legitimately available to them; until now, it hasn't been.
Or try thinking of it this way: for the sake of a thought experiment, imagine that the world moved to a new digital gold standard (something with the benefits of gold plus the ability to magically teleport through communications media). Set aside "Bitcoin" itself, and just assume *an asset* did succeed in filling this niche. Gold has no central issuer (if it did, it wouldn't be a very good or fair money), so this hypothetical successful "new gold" shouldn't, either. So what would this thing look like, in terms of market activity, as it was adopted and saturated the market? It obviously wouldn't shoot *directly* from $0 to $X (where X is some unimaginably high figure); that's not how markets work. There would be price discovery, which would take place in phases or cycles, as the asset was adopted, tested, and used by more and more market segments (like [any technology]( goes through, except this time pretty directly tying the asset price to the adoption). In fact, if you really sit down and run through this thought experiment properly, giving it your full attention and trying your best to imagine what things would most realistically look like as they played out in the actual global market, the conclusion is pretty inescapable: it would look like Bitcoin. At first, huge segments of the market (and monetary incumbents) would mock and ridicule the innovation, leveraging the power of the press and media to that effect, trying to suppress and resist its growth. If it managed to survive and weather this resistance, getting adopted anyway, it would do so in self-compounding growth cycles, rocketing upwards dramatically before rediscovering a new floor/baseline/foundation from which to perform its next thrust.
Now, that's not to say that Bitcoin will necessarily take over the world; remember, we assumed success at the outset. But it should *definitely* give you pause, and prompt any intelligent and self-interested person to spend a little more time researching it and figuring out whether it really could represent such an asset, or the potential thereof. If you ask me, at this point it seems more likely than not... but I've felt that way for over 5 years now, and maybe you'll reach a different conclusion.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:41:57
It does, indeed. Technically, every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract (the predicate, expressed in Script, must be satisfied in order for the transaction to be considered valid). Most transactions are admittedly very *simple* smart contracts, of the form "if a valid signature is provided from private key X which corresponds on the sep256k1 ECDSA curve to public key Y which hashes (via SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, and Base58Check) to address Z, the transaction is valid"... but this is indeed a smart contract.
Of course, Bitcoin is remarkably expressive *beyond* that simple construct, and you can do [a lot more]( with Script than just what is described above. Furthermore, improvements on the Bitcoin smart-contracting side are still being researched and implemented, like [MAST]( which will allow such contracts to be expressed more efficiently (and with added privacy benefits, too).
The idea that Bitcoin doesn't have smart contracts is a misconception which is probably the result of aggressive marketing by the team behind Ethereum (who have tried to differentiate themselves by making their own smart contracting language more "developer-friendly" in many ways, as well as closer to "Turing expressiveness" right out-of-the-box, at the very real cost of privacy, security, fungibility, efficiency, scalability, and general optimization as a monetary instrument). Whatever their marketing brochures say, Bitcoin is quite capable of handling smart contracts on its own, and this has been the case since it was first created.
As an interesting note, the idea to "generalize" Bitcoin (into an Ethereum-like protocol) actually predates Ethereum by many years... it was being discussed back in 2010, in fact. Satoshi himself [said that it was a bad idea]( because the design fundamentally "doesn't scale".
It's pretty clear that [he was right about that]( though if you're willing to admit "trustiness" into the protocol, you can actually sidestep a lot of the issues that would normally result from this trade-off. Of course, that invites the question of "Why bother using a blockchain at all, then?" (and there are other ways to harness all the "power" of Ethereum on top of a network like Bitcoin, anyway) but this is rapidly veering away from the question you asked, and probably too much to cram in a single reddit comment, anyway.

Better yet, "market cap" shouldn't be treated as an important figure in crypto at all, especially if you're trying to compare premined/instamined/ninjamined/airdropped coins against vanilla, fair-launch coins. In the "top 30 cryptos by market cap" I believe there are only *three* that fall in the latter category (Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero); the other 27 have gamed or abused the "market cap" metric significantly.
The market cap metric is a joke these days. The quicker people realize this, the better.

Good job, congratulations on the gains and it sounds like you're smart enough (and putting enough serious thought into this) that you'll continue making a lot more.
I'm not saying not to use Coinbase, because they *are* one of the most "trustworthy" companies out there right now. I would personally recommend Gemini over Coinbase, since they're just a *little* bit better in every way that Coinbase is good (in my opinion) and haven't got the same number of warts... but if I'm not mistaken, it can take a couple weeks to get verified on there.
Anyway, all I'm *really* trying to argue is "Don't trust them with your life savings if you can avoid it, and realize that even the best companies have risk." Sounds like you get the message, so good on you.

The "forgot about it for a few years" strategy has proven to be one of the most profitable strategies of all. I'm only half-kidding here.
It turns out that it's *really* hard to pay attention to Bitcoin and keep any money in it. The damn tech/ecosystem does everything it can to scare you off, and even us die-hard believers wind up questioning everything during the constant doomsday-scenarios that somehow keep cropping up.
By the way, depending on where/how you stored that coin you bought, you might be able to claim a (fairly long list of) fork-coins, like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, SuperBitcoin, and a few others. All in all, they add up to about $1000 per coin (it sounds like you had a full coin, which means it would be a free thousand dollars you could claim). It would take about an hour or two of work to claim them all and cash them out to BTC (which you could then sell for dollars if you wanted).
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:04:09


That's not really true. You could keep forking Bcash, for instance, and if both sides of any given fork have the EDA enabled, there's no reason that either side would necessarily die (even though both share the same PoW and difficulty algorithms).
Interestingly enough, this means that *any* hard fork of Bcash pretty much *can't* kill the chain it forked from; the EDA will keep it "alive" as long as someone is bored enough to mine it.

Again, airdropping your initial supply to holders of BTC does not make you Bitcoin.


This is a contradiction in terms. It does not make sense. It's like saying "Vimeo is a flavour of YouTube with an incompatible website."


UNIX is not a consensus protocol, nor is it a cryptocurrency. The existence of umbrella terms in general does not mean that "Bitcoin" is one.


There is no such thing as "the Bitcoin family"; there is **Bitcoin** and there are **altcoins**.


Altcoins are not Bitcoin, actually. If they were, then the "total supply of Bitcoin" wouldn't be finite at all, it would be infinite.


That is not "the reality now", that is simply you not understanding what you're talking about.


This, again, just shows that you don't know what you're talking about. If you want to argue that Bitcoin is a "family" then there are *thousands* of members of that family.
If you want to whittle it down to those cryptocurrencies which airdropped to holders of BTC and use "Bitcoin" somewhere in their name, then you have to include "Bitcoin Faith", "Ultimate Bitcoin", "Super Bitcoin", "Bitcoin God", "Bitcoin Clashic", "Bitcoin Gold", "Bitcoin Diamond", "Bitcoin Ruby", and quite a few more.
The fact that you're trying to hold an untenable position that there are "three versions of Bitcoin" (even using your flawed definition of the term) just shows how incredibly uninformed you are.


It does not, and as I already explained: *it's impossible to give it a differentiator without this creating a regressive issue*. You skipped over that part of the comment, I notice.


These people are either deliberately trying to mislead newcomers, or do not understand what they are talking about. If a fringe group of idiots decides to start calling airplanes "bicycles" that does not mean that society should or will suddenly start using the word "bicycle" to refer to airplanes.

Why use a blockchain rather than just a database, if a nation or central power controls the economic parameters, thereby obviating the need for a competitive consensus process?

Yes, exactly. That is exactly what the bet would represent. There's counterparty risk because you have to deposit into Bitfinex in the meantime, but factoring that out, yes.


It's perfectly fair. If you aren't confident that the hard fork will be successful, then don't take the bet. If you are, then do.
Your whine that "It isn't fair" makes *zero* sense. What else could the bet possibly represent?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:37:45

I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to Erik Voorhees (and still do), but unfortunately he *does* appear to be demonstrating malicious/nefarious intent in this case. On four separate occasions now, I've politely tried to ask to [simply acknowledge that his own blog post now represents a compelling list of arguments in favor of **opposing** the contentious SegWit2x hard fork attempt]( and he has been deliberately (and unfortunately rather blatantly) avoiding doing so, at all costs.
He claimed to want to unite the community, and he claimed that he wanted a more open and transparent dialogue. I used to believe that these were his goals, but it is not possible to reconcile this belief with the reality of the situation in this case. The only possible conclusion here is that Erik does have malicious intent, and until he takes the time to demonstrate otherwise, I no longer think we can assume good faith on his part.
This has nothing to do with how much money he has. This is a matter of **self-contradiction**, **lack of integrity**, and **cowardice**. 
When certain actions can cause financial harm to others, and you have no valid reasons to perform those actions (and it is made known to you that this is the case), you *cannot* go on to perform those actions *unless* you have malicious intent. I wish Erik was a good guy, I truly do, but he's been working hard to disprove that hypothesis.

It wasn't Core that refused to hard fork. The *community* has rejected every hard fork proposal made to date (and Core are part of the community).
Not one has gotten the requisite support to be a safe and non-contentious upgrade. Until one does, all attempts to violently force a network-wide consensus-breaking update should be considered outright attacks against Bitcoin.
If you don't like the Bitcoin consensus rules, fine. But you don't get to dictate new rules to those who *are* okay with Bitcoin, and who are peacefully using it to store or transfer our wealth.
Bitcoin Core isn't some organization in control of Bitcoin. It is simply the collection of developers (and processes) that have worked on the software that makes Bitcoin tick. They don't merge in code changes that have legitimate technical controversy, nor should they. If they started doing so, I am confident that Bitcoin would route around them and find a new repository to live in, where the stewards were more  scrupulous and honorable. Fortunately, there doesn't appear to be any danger of this, and Core have shown no signs of irresponsibility so far.

The UASF activated SegWit, *not once*, but *three separate times*, on *three separate coins*. We know exactly what happened.

What is essentially happening is you're saying "you *trust* the experts in cryptography to have vetted the libraries used, so what's the harm in adding a bit more *trust* into the process, and allowing the 'experts in blockchain XYZ' to have vetted the chain used?"
Sorry, it's just not a convincing argument, no matter how much you might like it. It's like saying "You *assume* the Cosmological Principle when reasoning about very-distant star systems, so why not *assume* bipedal carbon-based hominids have evolved elsewhere in that same Universe?" You might think this is an extremely convincing argument, but others of us just don't see it that way.
In short, you're orienting your thrusters in the wrong direction. We work to *minimize* (or come as close to *eliminating*) trust in our architecture and design when it comes to a decentralized blockchain, because, well... **that's the point.** If you say "Aha, but you *haven't* completely eliminated it, because in a superficial way, trust will *always* exist when there's a human involved (and you are, after all, a human)!" that's all well and good, but if you use it to try to justify leaking *more* trustiness into the design... well, in short: no thank you.
Also worth noting that you seem to be carefully avoiding both Sztorc's and Poelstra's works that I have referenced, as if they *don't* already provide direct answers to the questions you're asking. I'd be interested if you believe you have meaningful responses to these works (though I strongly suspect that you do not).

The two best resources to understand this phenomenon are these:
[Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory](
[The Bitcoin Hype Cycle](
The first one goes into more depth, while the second one is a few years older and summarizes the process a little bit more concisely.
The bottom line is that Bitcoin is a quantum upgrade to money itself, and comes pre-packaged with [direct incentives to adopt]( Adoption means fresh demand, and in a disinflationary predictable-supply context, such demand results in positive price feedback loops. Throw in some human nature (economic cycles) and you wind up with consistent, fractally-growing "price bubbles" on your way up the S-curve.
Bitcoin's kind of a big deal.

It is for the sake of the chain being secured, so that if someone tried to "rewrite history" in any way, it is pretty much impossibly expensive to do so. The "proof of work" requires energy to be used to find or create a block, while making it easy/trivial to *check* when a block is found or created; adding to the ledger is expensive, while verifying it is cheap. Beyond that, hashing in cryptocurrency doesn't have any other benefits, that's right.


The system is transitioning to a transaction-fee based mining reward, so by the time the final bitcoin is mined, there will still be an incentive for miners to keep building new blocks on the chain (whichever miner processes or includes a particular transaction gets to claim the fee attached to it).
A few years ago, a lot of people doubted that this long-term plan was sustainable, and argued that no one would be willing to pay transaction fees in Bitcoin... but in the past year or two, they were proven wrong in a fairly spectacular way. It seems that even when fees reach very high levels (like an average of $50 per transaction), demand still surprisingly exists and there are transactors willing to pay those fees.
So there never has to be a point where mining facilities/hardware suddenly "become useless", because they can still get their reward and incentive in the form of fees (rather than inflation).

The irony, the preposterous irony. How about you acknowledge the facts that I pointed out? Here they are again, **and this time, don't ignore them**:
If you are mad about the competitive transaction fee rates you've seen over the past year or so, direct your anger at Bitmain (who started a massive anti-SegWit campaign to preserve their ASICBOOST advantage, capping capacity at 1MB/block for far longer than it needed to be, and who regularly mine a disproportionate quantity of empty/nearly-empty blocks even to this day), direct your anger at Roger Ver (who has done the same things, and runs a mining pool that still will not include SegWit transactions or any blocks over 1MB in size, and which for some reason regularly mines very small blocks even when many transactions are queued in the mempool), and direct your anger at the spammers who have artificially inflated fee rates up until the Bcash opportunity cost of doing so became unconscionable (who are likely the same entities listed above). Do not direct your anger at the engineers and programmers who have done everything they can to increase capacity, safely, in a way that reduces the fees we have to pay in both the short and the long term because they bother to think these things through thoroughly.

The meaningfulness of transaction fees here is because they represent a difficult-to-game metric or indicator of demand and value.

Do yourself a favor and look into what a "user activated soft fork" is. In the case of activating SegWit, UASFs have been used on *three different coins* (Litecoin, Vertcoin, and Bitcoin), and in each case, the miners (who were trying to *resist* the activation of SegWit for political reasons) capitulated to the demands of the economic majority and signaled SegWit.
If this had *just* happened on Bitcoin, there might be some reasonable doubt as to whether it was the UASF or the NYA that truly got SegWit activated. But since we have seen an unbroken *pattern* of UASF victories (where, in each case, the miners scrambled to "agree" to activate it -- allegedly *coincidentally* right before the UASF would have started rejecting their blocks, after months and months of refusing to signal) we can confidently say that the NYA was nothing more than an attempt for the miners to save face, and the UASF is what truly brought SegWit to mainnet.

Generally because they are invested into altcoins and are trying to discredit Bitcoin by misleading others.


No, SegWit doesn't "centralize" Bitcoin at all, other than by increasing the size that blocks can be (which will marginally increase the cost of running a fully validating node, like any other blocksize limit increase would). 
The Lightning Network is actually one of the smartest ways to keep Bitcoin *decentralized*, by the way, by keeping these full validation costs down while allowing transactions at large scales and low costs to still take place.


Atomic swaps are basically just pairs of transactions (on different blockchains) where completing one of the transactions reveals a value that necessarily allows the other transaction to complete, too. In other words, it is a cryptographic way to ensure that either *both* transactions occur, or *neither* occur, while preventing it from being possible that *one* transaction occurs while the other does not. This allows you to make trustless trades between blockchains, like "I'll give you 1 BTC for 1000 LTC", without using an exchange or a middleman.

Just try a 2 sat/byte transaction yourself and see whether it is confirmed in a timely manner. Flag it RBF if you want to be safe and not risk your 3 cents. 
Digging around manually in blocks to see if you can spot a low fee transaction by hand is hilarious, though. It's hard to imagine that sounding like a smart idea to someone, but I guess I do tend to overestimate people.

For a backwards-incompatible consensus-code update to maintain chain identity, it requires an effectively unanimous migration (where the prior consensus ruleset is entirely abandoned, stopping the obsolete chain in its tracks). For such a change to occur, it would have to be an indisputable upgrade (i.e. pretty much entirely uncontroversial).
It's actually possible that Bitcoin *never* hard forks in the future. This might be surprising, but pretty much any technical upgrade can be achieved in a backwards-compatible way; soft-forks can achieve pretty much anything hard-forks can, if you get clever (and careful) enough with your implementation. Yes, that includes increases to the blockweight limit, though for now, we're still very far away from needing something along those lines.

Ethereum and Bcash were both massively pre-mined. 
Market cap is a problematic metric to the extent that it is gameable; significantly pre-mined coin supplies represent one way to game the metric.
The glut of pre-mined ICO coins is traditionally included in the "market share dominance percentage" metric, too. 
The bottom line is: you're looking at a trivially gameable metric that has been significantly gamed already, and still treating it as if it were meaningful. 
When you look at metrics that are *much* less gameable, like "transaction fees paid", you see that Bitcoin's market share is much more impressive than you had given it credit for. Ironically enough, you're trying to argue that "transaction fees" are a sign of *waning* relevance, when in reality they are one of the best indicators of *growing* relevance when it comes to a cryptocurrency. They represent demand incarnate.
Take a moment to think this through, rather than mindlessly downvoting and trying to desperately rationalize your previous set of beliefs.

This is **the exact same** as saying: "The Bitcoin market does not currently, in aggregate, consider transaction throughput to be a pain point, and is perfectly fine with the typical fee rates we are seeing and experiencing on the network."
If people really wanted lower fees, they would use SegWit. Since many aren't doing so, they're obviously just fine with the fees they are paying per byte.

Ok, then why do you seem to be having such a difficult time understanding the simple principles that I have been explaining, and why are you continually expressing confusion on the matter?
If you estimated the odds of a successful S2X fork to be *greater than 50%* (where "successful" is defined by "ultimately producing coins worth more than bitcoins"), you would unhesitatingly accept a 1:1 trade offer for bitcoins-to-bizcoins (unless a better offer was presented). The fact that you do *not* accept this offer (again, *regardless of your reasoning*) means that you necessarily *do not* believe that the chances of a S2X coin being worth more than a BTC in the end are greater than 50% (and in fact you believe that they are less than 50% -- considerably so, judging from your comments here).
When you try to argue "the offer is unfair because the fork may never occur" it is **the exact same thing** as you saying "bitcoins are worth more to me than hypothetical bizcoins"; the two statements are logically equivalent. The fact that you do not seem able to appreciate this equivalency indicates that you are not being truthful about your level-of-understanding (or at least that you are not qualified for the position that you claim to hold, although I suppose that it is possible to "work in risk management" without actually meaningfully understanding the principles involved in such a field; you could, for instance, be the janitor or secretary at a risk management company or something like that).
So, let us be very clear here, before we part ways: do you understand the equivalence between these two statements?
1) I do not believe that a 1:1 trade of bitcoins-to-bizcoins is fair, because there is extra risk assumed by the person trading their bitcoins (which do exist) that is not assumed by the person trading their bizcoins (which do not, and may never).
2) In my estimation, bizcoins are currently worth less than bitcoins.

You missed the point entirely. We know for a fact that *at least* 30% of the miners are signaling support for features that they aren't running, have no intention of running, and will almost certainly never actually run.
So subtract the 30% from the 94%, *at minimum*, before trying to trot it out as a figure of actual miner support. You'll probably want to also subtract out F2Pool's 10%, too (they're not signaling EC), as well as most of Slush's hashrate. That leaves you with somewhere in the ballpark of 50-60% that could be signaling NYA meaningfully... *but only if you put any stock into signaling at all, which you can clearly tell you should not!*

SegWit wasn't originally a blocksize increase. The reason that the weight was introduced was as a compromise to the big blockers.
They were *very* happy with it, at first, too. It was only after a few months that the anti-SegWit movement began (most likely due to Bitmain realizing that it would impact covert ASICBOOST and financing a campaign against it).
But in any case, the Core team *did* listen to the considerations of the big blockers, and even gave them a wonderful, elegant blocksize increase. Then the goalposts moved, and ever since then it has been about "firing Core no matter what" rather than improving Bitcoin. You can't really "include changes that would make them happier" when those changes are just "get rid of the developers" for all intents and purposes.

I do see where you're coming from, since I feel the same way, but to be fair, Bitcoin *does* seem like a scam or get-rich-quick scheme or fantasy until you spend a significant amount of time grokking it. 
It's far more difficult to understand and be convinced of the merit of it than almost anything else.
I would argue (Buttcoin brigades be damned) that possessing the ability to fully understand Bitcoin enough to appreciate its merit is a very impressive capability or trait. It requires a relatively rare balance of knowledge, conceptual flexibility, and open-mindedness to fully see all the moving parts (with their benefits and drawbacks) and why they fit together and work as they do.
And, of course, there are people who "love" and support Bitcoin but *don't* really understand it thoroughly or with due depth. As with anything, there are dumb fanboys doing their thing. Since it sounds so much like a scam, it would stand to reason that plenty of scam-susceptible people do "go Bitcoin" eventually. That can't be helped, and I can fully understand why that might seem annoying from the outside. Not that I agree with the sentiment of but I do understand it.

What do you mean by "only" 4.6 BTC? That's huge. The vast majority of Lightning Network's utility will almost certainly be in facilitating transfers far smaller than 1 BTC in size.
It's very strange to expect otherwise, and even stranger to expect channel capacities to be huge in the earliest days of the network (before the various development teams have even stopped discouraging mainnet use, no less).

Agreed, and it sucks. I definitely don't ignore it, though. I go out of my way to correct the misconceptions and lies that are being repeated by Ver's army... I just try to do so on their home turf (despite the karmic fallout this so often results in), to poke holes in the charade from the inside.
The unfortunate reality is that they've gotten *very* good at leveraging Brandolini's Law to their advantage, and they have learned how to gish gallop and muddy the waters incredibly well... so really, giving them *any* airtime more than necessary stands just as much of a chance of turning into an "accidental advertisement" as it does of actually teaching newcomers the truth. There's a happy balance to be struck somewhere, and feeling out exactly where it is isn't an easy task, but in this specific case there isn't really new information included in the tweet, and the info that *is* included is some of the "weakest" (or at least most irrelevant, when it comes to crypto) dirt that you can dig up on Ver. It's basically just free press for the guy.
I have typed up lists of lies that he's told and ridiculous stunts that he has pulled (like the "doxxing and publishing someone's full information that was retrieved with admin access from bc.i's internal databases over a $50 squabble which resulted from sending them BTC on accident through a different service" incident). Others have compiled similar lists. He's a known liar, ignorant in all things technical, and has consistently proven his lack of honor or moral integrity in ways that are *far* more pertinent than his felonious shipping of explosives or history as a politician... so referencing these things out of the blue isn't particularly effective, anyway.
Again, I'm not ignoring Ver's influence, but I'm doing what I can to combat it. That includes starving him of attention when possible, just as it includes trying to spread the truth in response to him spreading his lies.

Actually, good point. Huge mistake on my part.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:07:56
This is a really good question, and the answer will surprise you. The reason it takes so long to get your bitcoin is actually that *your dollars are slow*, believe it or not. For the first time, you are being forced to see just how *slow* non-Bitcoin money is. 
When you pay someone via credit card or ACH transfer, the payment takes days (or in some cases months) to totally finalize. In the meantime, the payment can actually be reversed. [Credit card fraud is massively ubiquitous.]( These sorts of risks have to be accounted and paid for, one way or another.
With Bitcoin, things are much more instant. In a matter of minutes, your payments are finalized, and from then on, the person who received the coins can go their merry way and know *for a fact* that the money is now theirs, and safe from being reversed. 
So if someone offers you dollars for your bitcoins, you have to be aware that they can change their mind, and take the dollars away from you, but you can't do that with coins that you gave them. Once you send them, you give up control of those bitcoins. If you are a company selling bitcoins (like Coinbase is), you have to be confident that the person buying bitcoins from you is not going to turn around and reverse their payment (getting both the bitcoins and the dollars). You have to wait until you are almost *sure* that the dollars are fully yours, before relinquishing control of your bitcoins to the buyer.
Once you are in Bitcoin, though, of course everything moves much more quickly. It is transitioning from fiat to coins that incurs the friction and slow-down.
TL;DR: The problem is not Bitcoin, it's your dollars.

The "initial point" that you accuse me of "derailing" was this:


This is 100% false, and my comment directly corrected it, explaining the truth of the matter. In fact, if you look back at the thread, *my response is the only one that directly addresses the original subject!*
Look, we get it, you're upset because you lost an argument online. But stop trolling and username-summoning me with accusations that have no basis in reality. That is harassment.
Also, the word you wanted to use was *tangentially*. Cute attempt, though.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:52:53
Yes, Bitcoin is divisible. Yes, it could hit $1M per coin (really, as long as it doesn't implode and demand for it persists, this is inevitable because the total supply of dollars is not constrained as the total supply of bitcoins is). Yes, most people can't reasonably afford full coins any more. Yes, with every Bitcoin price increase the relative valuation of fiat currencies drops more and more. I can't speak to your 63%/43% statistics but they very well could be true. And yes, investors will (and should) try to invest in such a way to maximize their expected returns.
Looks like we are pretty much in agreement on most points. That last one, in particular, is interesting, because if you think about it, as a digital gold-like asset not closely correlated to other asset classes (i.e. from a finance perspective, it has very attractive *alpha* and *beta* values), Bitcoin should *absolutely* be included in well-diversified financial portfolios managed by investors who are trying to maximize their returns. Even though it's a "risky" asset, its presence in a portfolio actually *minimizes* portfolio risk in most cases, because of its beta. Finance is crazy!
Since it is not yet prevalent in most such portfolios, that should give you an idea of just how much potential for growth remains.
Anyway, it sounds like you're still in the "skeptic" phase but asking the right questions, so I'm confident you'll reach intelligent conclusions if you keep tugging the thread for long enough. May your journey be as enjoyable as it is enlightening!

Let's recap, shall we? 
You incorrectly claimed that there is no correlation between the market cap and price volatility of Bitcoin. I corrected this, and explained that with a few minutes of quick research, you can find the truth. 
You then freaked out.
You also claimed that adoption and price are totally uncorrelated (again, totally incorrect). I explained that this, too, is false, and I provided a handful of metrics that wholly prove the point. 
You, again, freaked out. This time you tried to say "Oh people buying and holding and using bitcoins doesn't count as adoption, only people relinquishing bitcoins does for some reason!" as a desperate attempt to avoid acknowledging the basic fact that **you were wrong, end of story**. 
I then provided you with a nice, newbie-friendly explanation of what "using" Bitcoin actually is, and where the value of the coin comes from. This is actually a well-known (classic) piece; the fact that you tried to make fun of it actually just further confirms that you're a newcomer to this space and that you haven't spent a whole lot of time reading and learning yet. It's okay, we've all been there. But again, it's best not to try to argue with people about this stuff until *after* you've put in the hours to figure it out yourself.
Of course, your bruised ego prevented you from reading and learning from the link I supplied, and instead you've lashed out and tried to attack me, the person who has been helpfully trying to educate you so that you don't continue acting the fool. You're emotionally agitated, so you're shutting out new information and trying to convince yourself that I'm some malevolent entity trying to trick you or something. It is quite ironic.
I've done three minutes of googling on my phone, to get you started, but I suspect that little ego of yours will get in the way yet again. It's up to you whether you learn and grow, or fall deeper into the pit of agitation and falsehood.
Also, by the way: you have said "I'm out" and "that's it, I'm done" and "I'm seeing my way out of this conversation" in pretty much every comment you've left. It comes across as a bit silly.

Their debts are all held in inflationary currency. These debts would not magically convert into Bitcoin debts, and I doubt that people would be so eager to take on debt denominated in a deflationary currency, so the "problem" you're citing doesn't actually exist and doesn't seem like it ever would. Please enlighten me if I'm mistaken on this in some way.

So, again, I ask you: where's the problem, exactly?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:44:11
The fork not happening *is* one way that the fork could not work out.
But more importantly...
**It doesn't matter what you use to justify why you think the bet is not fair. In the end, you are still saying "1 Bizcoin is worth less than 1 Bitcoin to me."**
The OP also assumes the corollary risk of "If the Bitcoin chain dies once Bizcoin launches, he loses his Bizcoins anyway." But again, this isn't really relevant.
When you say "That bet is not fair because there is a risk that the fork never happens" you are simultaneously saying "In my estimation, there is a less than 50% chance that Bizcoins are ever worth as much as (or more than) Bitcoins." 
**It is the same statement.**
I do not know how much more simply I could explain this. What exactly is confusing you?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:05:32
The tokens are exactly what they seem, and represent futures for possible outcomes of the upcoming Bizcoin fork attempt. Bitfinex has laid out the terms very clearly and fairly.
If you believe that the S2X fork will be successful, you should go buy BT2 and sell BT1. If you believe it will fail, you should do the opposite. 
It is straightforward and maximally fair. Those who say otherwise lack a basic understanding of what the tokens *are*.

The fact that "a publicly traded company would have frozen his stock options in exactly the same way" is entirely irrelevant.

I don't know what you have in mind when you say "fold" (because it doesn't really make sense to "fold" money itself)... but I will say that if you mean "Convert my money into non-monetary goods and/or services" then I'm happy to tell you that I do so on a regular basis. I use my money to buy groceries, cars, vacations, and all sorts of other things.
You seem like you wish that Bitcoin would *not* succeed (or rather, *continue* to succeed), and it seems like it upsets you on a personal level that it works as advertised, and the implications of this functionality. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, but I'll try to make one friendly suggestion before we part ways: it's typically a bad idea to identify yourself as "anti-something" (especially when you haven't taken the time to truly understand that thing); positioning yourself like this sets you up to be frustrated and angry if and when that thing succeeds to any degree. A healthier approach is to find something *else* that you *do* like, and be "pro-something" instead.

It depends on the hard-fork. If it's an uncontroversial upgrade, well-specified, well-implemented, and well-tested, there's nothing scary about it.
So far, no such proposals have been made. In fact, of the hard-fork proposals that *have* been made, [**every single one has been a non-starter because of it being fundamentally terrible**]( I urge you to read the linked comment thoroughly, and make sure that you understand every sentence therein. It really does explain the history of each hard-fork proposal to date.


Satoshi's own words also include things like: 
* "[Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices]( (note that he is *supporting* this "tyranny" in his comment, urging prudence when it comes to scaling and remembering that chain-space is a fundamentally limited resource)
* "[Don't use this patch, it'll make you incompatible with the network, to your own detriment. We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.]( (note that he was strongly discouraging anyone from using a consensus-incompatible blocksize-increasing patch, and that he advocated a "phased in change" *if we get closer to needing it*, which is an eerily-perfect description of what Segwit represents)
* "[The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.  Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of.  The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time.  It would have been an explosion of special cases.  The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates.  The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met... Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them.  All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, **even though they may not know how to read them**... these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.]( (note that he is talking as if the very idea of a hard-fork is fundamentally anti-Bitcoin, and should be avoided if at all possible, and describing how much effort he put in *from the beginning* towards making sure important changes can be soft-forked in later... also notice how his description of how he envisioned future transaction-version upgrades working is an *absolutely perfect* description of how Segwit works, with old nodes not fully understanding the new transaction types but being able to remain in-consensus anyway)
* "[I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.]( (notice how this goes directly against the common rbtc narrative that "we need multiple different compatible reference implementations")
Satoshi said a lot of things, and if you really want to, you can dig up different quotes of his to support contradicting goals or factions. Any time increasing the blocksize limit came up in conversation, he *strongly* discouraged actually doing so. Whenever people suggested he pre-program in an increase (or even pre-specify one, to "lay out the plan ahead of time"), he deliberately (and even conspicuously, in some cases) ignored the suggestion, carefully answering and responding to *everything else* the person had said *except* for that one point. People told him that the limit would become controversial later on down the road, and he knew that this would be the case... and yet, he left it there anyway.


Speaking of quotes from Satoshi, he actually said that the minrelayfee (which was implemented a couple months after the blocksize limit was) was "[a first try at intentionally trying to prevent]( spam attacks on the network. This fairly conclusively kills the "blocksize limit was meant to limit spam" narrative in its tracks... but I think if you rephrase it to "the blocksize limit was implemented to protect against certain denial-of-service attacks" then you will have a much stronger case.


That's not true, actually. The blocksize limit was put in place on [July 15, 2010]( and Satoshi stayed around for many months after that, committing updates regularly.
Finally, (and this is important): **Segwit increased the blocksize to a 3.7MB limit**. Segwit *is* a blocksize increase. We reached consensus for a blocksize increase, and implemented it... the engineers were just brilliant enough to implement it in a backwards-compatible manner. So please, keep that in mind when discussing the limit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:01:43
Just so you are aware, the standard nonce space is exhausted by a single standard Antminer S9 about 3000 times per second; the extraNonce value needs  to be incremented after that in order to continue mining.
This is definitely outside of the scope of your demo here, but it's worth mentioning to keep things in perspective, at least.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:45:29


That's a pretty hasty (and I would argue incorrect) conclusion to draw. It's still possible to mine ASICBoost covertly with Segwit deployed, it's just extremely conspicuous (empty blocks are frowned upon). There's also the distinct possibility that a certain altcoin (and community) exists primarily to preserve the profitability of the covert ASICBoost exploit, and this community is notoriously hostile to Bitcoin and the public image thereof.


Hardly. The BDPL is pretty awesome, all things considered.


Arguably the opposite, actually.


Frankly, I don't really see it. The version-rolling can (relatively trivially) be accounted for. If anything, the "disruption" that the introduction of overt ASICBoost (cleverly combined with the BDPL) might result in is the positive, welcome kind. [Bitmain's hegemony]( is fairly worrisome at this point; some disruption on this front would be an incredibly good thing for the Bitcoin network.


It's not clear what you're referring to here.


I wouldn't consider it the end of the world or anything, but considering the Bitmain situation, it would be less-than-ideal, and I personally would speak out against such an effort. Considering Bitmain's current stranglehold over SHA-256d, "evil" soft forks seem like one of the most worrying attack vectors that Bitcoin is currently susceptible to.

@_date: 2017-10-05 03:36:10
It's a subreddit *defined* by antitheticality. This subreddit is about Bitcoin. In fact, we deliberately work hard to keep it so. That subreddit is not; rather, it is about *discontentment*. At any given hour, you can go look at their front page (I'm not even bothering to do so right now, because this literally holds true 24/7) and the majority of the posts there are complaints, violent and retaliationary rhetoric, absolutely shameless promotion of *anything that could possibly be construed as a "competitor" to Bitcoin*, and brazenly negative cult-of-personality obsessions. It is impossible to exaggerate the hypocrisy and dishonesty so purely embodied by that subreddit. 
To top it off, they regularly brigade this subreddit and purposefully stir up drama (I mean, take a look around you right here) which means we're effectively *forced* to deal with their bullshit, one way or the other. When we clean the place up from all this nonsense, you get the inevitable and incessant shrieks of "CENSORSHIP!" and when we don't, you get drama-filled threads chock full of noise where the signal never stands a chance, and then drive-by concern trolls like you chiming in to say "Haha look you guys are no better than them!" while we shake our heads and facepalm.
The thing is, it's *too* obvious. I thank my lucky stars that Bitcoin's first round of "arch-nemeses" are so resoundingly incompetent; if the opposition were even halfway clever this would be a much nastier episode. As it stands, anyone with half a brain can see the disparity in quality and rationality between the two "factions" and get the lay of the land pretty quickly. I'm sure the attacks will improve over time, but for now it's a pretty clean sweep.

IOTA is revolutionary in that it *un-solves the double-spend problem!*
In Bitcoin, the ledger is designed to converge upon a state of consensus. In IOTA, there is no such convergence. In fact, if you factor out special centralized validator nodes ("coordinators") from the equation, any attacker with a GPU or two would be able to double-spend at will (especially easily during periods of low network transaction load).
Their whitepaper is a mishmash of ridiculous assumptions a la "if an attacker focused on this completely-contrived and not-at-all-relevant type of attack (rather than just double-spending by out-hashing other users), here's a series of math symbols and formulas to sort of model that and prove something no one ever cared or asked about" and represents one of the most brazen attempts at academic handwaving that I've ever borne witness to. It sure does entice the rubes, though, I'll grant them that.

You think demonstrably incorrectly.
The OP described the performance of a Bitcoin-related portfolio once you factor out the 10 best days per annum. You asked what things would be like if you factored out 90% of the remaining (poor-performance) days of the year. This is (approximately) equivalent to a portfolio which lacks any Bitcoin component whatsoever. I pointed this out and observed that this necessarily forgoes the tens of thousands of percent returns that Bitcoin has provided since the beginning of 2013.

He's referencing [this analysis]( and sort of lazily paraphrasing (or misremembering) a lot of it. 
Furthermore, that analysis has been critiqued (some might even say "debunked") numerous times since then; it included a lot of assumptions phrased as facts.
Finally, Satoshi is perfectly capable of spending coins that he mined without upsetting the market; the easiest way to do so would be spending the most-recently-mined coins first (which would effectively be "drowned out" by the aggregate public mining profile and indistinguishable from other coins mined around that time).

First, I want to mention that I was impressed with the article, which was written well (and in a fair and balanced tone, no less). I also laughed out loud at one of your other articles a few weeks ago (specifically the one about IOTA), so I respect what you're doing in general.
My question is: why was "Bitcoin Core" listed as a 4-poop-emoji "shitcoin" on your site for a while? It appeared to be referencing **Bitcoin**, with the ticker **BTC**, rather than the [Bitcoin Core cryptocurrency]( which implies a number of not-so-great things. You are clearly intelligent enough to be able to distinguish between a software repository and a blockchain token, so even the *naming* on the website was a big red flag, and at least to me, served as a strong indication of dishonest intent. Aside from that, no supportive reasoning was provided to explain why exactly BTC was marked as it was, adding another red flag into the mix.
I hope the rest of your series retains the quality you began with, but I worry that there's a more sinister agenda here in light of the above.

No, I do not. The subreddit enforces certain rules, and curates content according to those rules (and if users deliberately break those rules, [they are appropriately ejected from the subreddit]( Large online communities need good moderation in order to facilitate quality discussions; see the excellent [Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism]( Less-Wrong article linked in the sidebar for a fuller appreciation of this concept.
In fact, we can see **direct** proof that the moderation policies of are having a positive effect, by taking a look at the "alternative" at rbtc. That place is basically comprised of 100% hatred, irrationality, and falsehoods... and as I already mentioned earlier, *they remove content they disagree with all the time, even if it doesn't break any rules!* It's obvious that the policies here are having *some* positive effect when you contrast the quality-of-discussion against that place.


I was. Things got heated. It was an interesting time.


That's simply not true. Posts mentioning BCH were allowed (but not allowed to overrun the front page); posts trying to *lie* about it or *promote it* were not allowed, because they directly violate subreddit rules. In any case, this is a subreddit about Bitcoin; for subreddits about altcoins see and for subreddits about airdropped altcoins (like BCH or BTG) see We even have a custom flair and bot-script set up to help redirect people to this subreddit: [see this comment for an example]( It sounds like you are repeating a false narrative here; I'm sure plenty of people didn't know about the launch of BCH, but that wasn't because of the moderation policies of if anything, *too much* BCH-related content was approved here.

It's kind of funny how you keep trying to pretend that I'm somehow upset or trying to argue here. The only thing I've done is politely ask you to support your claim, and then calmly observe that you continually refuse to do so. If that's what you call a "tantrum" then you have a very nonstandard definition of that word. May I recommend a dictionary?
Here was the original commenter's statement (who was not me):


The observation that the banking infrastructure which supports non-Bitcoin payment processing is costly to run (for a number of reasons) is a perfectly valid observation. Here was your response:




If anyone here is throwing a tantrum, it's pretty clear it's you.
You made the claims that the argument is "dumb" and "intentionally misleading" although it is neither. Banks, their physical buildings, their employees, and their computers *do* cost money to maintain. Nothing is misleading about that. The commenter did not claim that Bitcoin can do everything that banks can do for cheaper costs, and they did not say that Bitcoin has equivalent transaction volume to other payment networks.
Your statement was a claim, and no matter how much you pretend that it is unquestionably true, that is not the case. And here you are, desperately (and pathetically) doing your best to try and avoid actually supporting your argument.
You can't support your argument, or you already would have. The best you can do is toss an impotent *ad hominem* or two at me.

I think it's less zealotry and more the fact that your fantasy doesn't make sense in any way, and this subreddit has explained why hundreds of times at this point.
Basically, a "closed" system like what you describe has no need for a blockchain. If you trust the other banks involved (as in your SWIFT example) then you don't need a blockchain. Just a database with a strict read/write access protocol.
The blockchain enables you to safely interact with untrusted nodes. That's what the term means. You and many others like you have heard the "Blockchain great, Bitcoin meh" meme so often that you believe it, but you haven't spent enough time considering what that means or if it makes sense.
It doesn't. A blockchain is not some super-database. It is big and wasteful and clunky, but it allows you to transact without trusting the other nodes involved on the network. A SWIFT or other interbank transfer protocol would in no way benefit from trying to implement some half-blockchain Frankensteinian abomination, and we're tired of explaining why to people who don't understand the technology they're pontificating about.

You're missing something: hashing is only profitable if the block rewards make it so. 
As an extreme example, consider bitcoins worth $0.00001 each. How much would anyone pay to mine those coins? Not much at all. 
That means someone could come along and decide to buy $10,000 of mining gear and just 51% attack the network for lulz.
Get it now? "As long as hashing is profitable and hard" means "as long as Bitcoin is worth enough" - they are the same statement.

How so?


No, not necessarily. A network with 500 nodes being used to validate and process transactions, run by 500 different people dispersed across the world is a "better" Bitcoin network than one with 50,000 nodes all run by a single guy in Delaware. The first network might have 100x fewer nodes, but is 500x more decentralized than the other.
Even more relevantly, a network with 500 nodes *each running different consensus rules* is nowhere near as strong or valuable as a network with 499 nodes running consensus-compatible code.
It's not as simple as "more nodes is better" and you'll notice that no one (not even Garzik) is trying to argue that "having more nodes is better so we shouldn't disconnect S2X nodes". That's not a real argument.
You have done an excellent job of proving my point that there are no actual counterarguments against the service bit disconnection, though. Thank you for that.

"Near second"? Not even close.
Ethereum isn't good at the things Bitcoin is good at. Granted, most people don't yet realize or appreciate what those things actually are (leaderlessness, immutability, sound monetary policy, self-validability, unforgeable and inimitable costliness of ledger extension, etc) but suffice to say, Ethereum is *particularly* bad at these sorts of things. This arguably represents Ethereum's "differentiating value proposition" relative to Bitcoin; it makes aggressive fundamental trade-offs *away* from the direction of **ideal money** to try instead to offer a "world computer" of very questionable and haphazard tokenomics.
It doesn't matter if their "eth2 PoS plan" is 100% successful in everything it could ever hope to achieve, it still wouldn't make Ethereum suddenly better than Bitcoin at the things that Bitcoin is good at. Ethereum is not "a near second" at all, it's not even playing the same game. It would only look that way to someone who *still* hasn't put in the time and effort to understand what makes Bitcoin so special.

The "replay protection" that was added basically [boils down to]( "if your transaction includes an output to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi, we promise not to mine that transaction on Bizcoin"... but there's nothing really preventing them from doing so, ~~and in fact if their intent is to *attack and try to kill* Bitcoin (as they have made very clear on numerous occasions it is), then reneging on such a policy would be exactly what you would expect (and what might do the most damage to Bitcoin in the hopes of driving people to Bizcoin instead).~~
Meanwhile, *even if they adhere to the policy*, it would needlessly bloat Bitcoin's UTXO set... it is an unambiguously hostile, disingenuous approach that doesn't really meaningfully represent actual replay protection.

Thanks for providing these quotes. I now see why you're asking what you're asking, and it's a good question.
Basically, the blocks in Bitcoin take 10 minutes on average to mine (if they're being mined faster than this, then the network will increase the difficulty to slow them down; if they're being mined slower than this, it will decrease the difficulty so that they're easier to find, and are mined quicker). 
If the block-time were set to a smaller average, like 5 minutes or 1 minute, then less Proof-of-Work would be needed to mine each block (by definition). This means that it requires **more blocks** to be mined for a particular transaction to be considered equivalently secure as in a 10-minute-blocktime scenario. 
It is the proof of work that makes double-spending such a difficult task. When the hashing problem takes ten minutes per block, this represents a much higher level of "work" required per block, meaning that much more CPU resources must be dedicated to the task, meaning that any transactions included in a block are reasonably secure, because such a huge expenditure would be required to execute a double-spend. If the hashing problem only took 1 minute of work to mine, then it would take about 10 blocks before you achieved a similar level of "work" that would be required to double-spend such a transaction.

Please show me where people said this.
It's about number of blocks. If, somehow, a year went by when no blocks were mined, your 1-confirmation transaction is no more "secure" than after 9 minutes wherein no blocks were mined.
Of course, you could be referring to the propagation of a transaction throughout the network, which takes seconds regardless of whether a block is mined. But it takes blocks being mined after your transaction is confirmed before you can safely say a double-spend of that transaction is infeasible.

This is perhaps my favorite part of the claim. You think that the second-biggest address, in terms of bitcoin balance, represents the second-largest holder of bitcoin in the world.
Do I really have to explain the problems with that assumption? Let me know if I do...

It's not at all like this.
It's like a futures market where you can buy a token that represents "Bitcoin staying Bitcoin" or alternatively a token that represents "SegWit2X killing Bitcoin and taking its place" as the possible outcome-representative tokens.


Apparently not, because you're babbling about car races and making a fool of yourself.

Don't worry too much about labels. Strange innovations kind of warp them. 
It's quasi-currency, quasi-investment, quasi-commodity, quasi-company, quasi-protocol, quasi-private, quasi-public, quasi-money. And a lot of other things, too.
It's very weird. But in any case, the point is that deflation can exist just fine without dragging debtors down into an inevitable nightmare. Surely you agree that even if Bitcoin grows and "succeeds" meaningfully, there will still be plenty of USD used and in circulation, right?

Yes. The very first word in the quote from me: "If"
That is a crucial word. I'm not planning for Amazon to adopt Bitcoin at all; I'm saying that **if** they do, then a certain outcome will occur. 
Saying "If the sun goes supernova tomorrow, we will die" is not planning for the sun to go supernova, nor is it saying that such a thing is likely to occur. Not even close. What that statement says is that *if* the sun does a certain thing (explode), *then* a certain other thing (our death) will follow. 


No, this is you missing the point. Bitcoin doesn't have any capacity issues. Bitcoin can handle whatever traffic hits it. You're still not getting my point...

Read the actual rule from the sidebar:


Cobra isn't promoting any such client software. I don't believe such software even currently exists. He's also not trying to force anything through without overwhelming consensus; he's trying to get a dialogue started to see if such consensus can be achieved.
You're allowed to discuss proposals here, and always have been. You're not allowed to violate the rule above. Cobra isn't breaking any rules in this blog post. If he forked Core, swapped in a PoW change, and said "Hey run this software instead of Core, let's fork Bitcoin!" that would be in violation of the rule, and we would flag it for removal.

@_date: 2017-10-06 19:20:59
We have seen (at least) 3, I just explained that.
The *entire point* of such UASFs is to force the miners to start mining blocks that activate the upgrade in question (in this case, SegWit). The success scenario is that miners fall in line and do what the economic majority is demanding, because trying to do otherwise risks their blocks being orphaned by the userbase (thereby incurring the proof of work energy loss but not yielding valuable block rewards). Yes, we know that "the gun can shoot" because it is a very small amount of well-tested code; rejecting non-signaling blocks is trivial.
If you're asking "Have any miners tried mining blocks that do *not* adhere to the UASF rules, despite this risk?" then the answer is yes. We see that with Bcash. What happens in such scenarios is that the non-UASF chain splits off into an altcoin.

It's remarkable to me that people are trying to weigh in on the matter when they're not even cursorily informed on the subject in the first place. Since I'm using a very specific phrase ("proof of reserves") with a very specific meaning in Bitcoin, the assumption is that anyone trying to engage me in discussion has at least a surface-level understanding of what that phrase means. 


I am not aware of a "Proof of Liabilities" scheme or how such a thing would work, only Proof of Reserves, and PoR would only work on the crypto-side of things (fiat doesn't have these capabilities).
Fortunately, Proof of Reserves doesn't require a 3rd party auditor, nor does it require trusting that every depositor verifies their balance.

No offense, but you don't seem to understand what I'm saying at all.


It's actually surprising how badly you interpreted my comment, if this is what you got out of it.
The point is that it doesn't matter if Walmart or Amazon or Greece or the UN want to use Bitcoin; Bitcoin will scale to accommodate the volume of traffic that it needs to. If and when a large organization decides to get involved, **there will be an actual reason to increase the blocksize**, so the blocksize will be increased. Until that reason exists, don't get your hopes up too high for a massive blocksize increase.


I believe you don't know what that phrase means.

Did you read the article, though, to see what specific questions it raises?








In other words, this article reaffirms exactly what I said above: the proof proved exactly what it proved (that Mark K. had control of at least 424,242.4242 BTC on 2011-06-23 06:50:15). 
Again, as I mentioned above, what it did *not* prove is that Gox would have control of these coins 3 years later.

The Blockchain may be relatively expensive to run in aggregate, but on a microscopic level (i.e. the only frame of reference that matters for any individual participant) it is by far the cheapest manner of transferring value from one party to another, without a custodian handling the transfer for you.
The Bitcoin blockchain is, without a shadow of a doubt, the tool best suited for machine micropayments.
Only a frothy-mouthed Buttcoiner who spends hours each day talking about "Satoshi's spaceship" (even though that hasn't been funny for 8 months now) would argue otherwise. And, of course, there's little reason to take such morons seriously.

Yeah, the only problem is: there are no actual benefits of a centralized blockchain. It'd be like an "offline Internet terminal" - it's an oxymoron.
The entire benefit of a blockchain, the only reason why the tech is revolutionary, is the decentralized consensus it manages to achieve. Everything else can be done better and cheaper with a database, but that consensus is key.
So if you have a central authority instead, and they offer you a blockchain, the natural next question everyone will ask is: "What benefits would using this have?"

They didn't "not attack" -- in fact, there is proof that GHash double spent at one point.

I have seen you reference this blog post many times now, as your sole "defense" of why you continue to support S2X in the face of overwhelming community and ecosystem backlash. I would like to take a moment to politely address and rebut every argument made in the blog post, and I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to consider what I write and grace me with a thorough response, if you disagree with me about any of this.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.


We currently see *less* than 95% support for S2X/NYA and if F2Pool does indeed stop signaling (as Wang Chun has indicated they intend to) this will likely drop to ~80% or so. Does this mean that consensus for the NYA no longer exists? If not, what if (hypothetically speaking) the miner support dropped even further... to below 50%? Would you still argue that "miner consensus for the NYA exists because at one point in the past the signaling was 95%+" even though thay signaling figure is now outdated?


I think the status quo now (with SegWit activated on Bitcoin and Bcash available for anyone who wants 8MB blocks instead) is not really "a state of atrophy nobody wants" and it seems to be somewhat disingenuous to pretend that it is such. Would you mind explaining how the *current* situation in Bitcoin (the status quo *now*) qualifies as such a state? 


Ever since SegWit activated and Bcash splintered off, transaction confirmations and average fee rates have been improving dramatically from users' perspectives. The trend appears to have successfully reversed.


This is a very gameable metric, unfortunately. I can launch an ERC-20 token in a few minutes with an arbitrarily large token supply, sell one for $1 to my daughter, and *technically* subsume 99.999% of the Total Crypto Market Cap single-handedly and overnight.
Granted, this would be taking it very much *to the extreme* and would not maximize my chances to profit off of this token, but the principle is important to understand (and it is important to understand that creators of altcoins and crypto-tokens continually take advantage of this effect in subtle and not-so-subtle ways).
In other words, the "If measurements matter" in this section is quite suspect, because the specific measurements you are citing are significantly gameable and there are meaningful incentives to do exactly that.


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Solutions have *happened*.


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. There is no impasse any more.


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Bitcoin is not "sitting idle" in any sense.


One of the *most important* core virtues of Bitcoin is that the consensus rules of the protocol are not subject to arbitrary changes by powerful entities. If they were, things like the 21-million-coin-cap would be much less "set in stone" and many of the underlying fundamental assumptions that go into Bitcoin would be invalidated. The consensus protocol is deliberately structured to be *very hard* to modify. This is a strength of Bitcoin's, and perhaps even its most important one.


I believe that this is a powerful sentence and statement, but I think it applies much better to the assumption that S2X will be accepted *as* Bitcoin by the market at large. This particular assumption seems to be the *only* offered rationale behind the omission of strong replay protection in the S2X codebase, which is the largest source of technical controversy around the initiative. 
I think you are right: prudent caretakers *cannot* make massive assumptions and then plow forward as if these assumptions are inviolate truths. Strong replay protection should therefore be included in *any* hard fork proposal that doesn't have near-100% support from *all stakeholders* in the community (developers and individual users included). 
I have yet to hear an argument to the contrary, other than "Just assume S2X wins." Is this not a huge cause for concern?


A contentious split in the blockchain already occurred with Bcash. Nothing can be done about that now.


A contentious hard fork already occurred with Bcash. You were correct, and now such a technical rebellion has occurred.


Yes, so if there is a large *social* pushback against S2X (which it would be very difficult to deny that there is), then shouldn't that factor in to whether or not you continue to support it?




Yes, and now that SegWit is active on Bitcoin and Bcash has split off via a hard fork, both paths are available and both sides can take the path they favor.


**Yes, wholly agreed.**
S2X *is* the threat of a contentious hard fork now. Please do not discount the opinions of the users who do not support this hard fork, because like you say: by doing so, you only serve to increase the threat and the damage that it could do to the community.


Yes, we should work on finding unity. S2X (and the supporters thereof) doesn't seem interested in doing so. We should work on finding common ground, and this should *necessarily* include common ground with the developers who have been steadily (and voluntarily) improving Bitcoin for the past 5 years.


How does a contentious (and by your own admission technically unnecessary) 2MB hard fork on a network with SegWit already active, *especially in a context where an alternative 8MB chain already exists*, have any "potential to unify"?
I think that if you take a step back and honestly assess the situation *as it stands now*, the only valid conclusion that you could possibly reach is that the 2MB fork *only* has the potential to split the community even worse than it currently is. It is clear that many people oppose the fork, but support SegWit (and others oppose SegWit, but like the 8MB fork idea and already support Bcash as a result), so combining "the worst of both worlds" stands no real chance of facilitating unity.

It is definitionally impossible to lose more than 100% of a direct long investment into Bitcoin.


The market price of Bitcoin has dropped ("the bubble popped") by more than 70% on *many* separate occasions. Once in 2010, once in 2011, twice in 2013, and now once in early 2018. It's part of [The Bitcoin Hype Cycle]( and it's something that us old-timers are *very* used to, and expect. Two months ago, I explicitly predicted that this type of drop would happen soon:






No, that is not a loss **at all**, that is a 3200% **gain** from your initial cost basis. You would be up $9700 from a $300 investment. Double check your math, my friend.


In percentage terms, *much* more, both after 2013 and in 2011. The 2011 bubble went from $0.11 to $32 and back down to under $2. *That* was a mean drop.
This one hasn't necessarily bottomed yet, though. It could potentially be harsher. But so far, it's not that bad.

One glaring hole in the theory is that Satoshi knowingly sent him 50BTC in the first-ever transaction on the young network.

Define "mining centralization" please. Does pointing your miner to a mining pool mean that you've been "centralized"? If so, isn't mining Bitcoin *at all* a form of centralization, since Bitcoin itself could be considered one giant mining pool?


Any function a computer performs can be optimized for.

Any Bitcoin transaction (other than a block reward coinbase) will spend exactly as many inputs as outputs - they will always match. If there are more outputs than inputs, the transaction is invalid. However, if there are more inputs than there are outputs, the leftover amount is considered a transaction fee and goes to the miner who found the block.
Any decent wallet software will make sure that you don't pay a huge fee by accident, typically by sending the leftover inputs to another address you control (known as a "change address") rather than as a fee. However, you can craft transactions manually (rather than with a wallet) and if you don't double-check your math, you can accidentally forget to spend all the inputs, which lets the miner gobble up the leftovers.
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:41:32
It leads to the opposite, actually. The higher the price of Bitcoin, the more people spend it. It's the wealth effect, and it is supported by empirical data... The "hoarding" hypothesis was pretty much  definitively disproven in November 2013.

Poor logic, my friend. The fact that a bank switched from full to fractional reserves (and subsequently failed and shut down as a result of doing so) does not mean that they could not survive on the original paradigm. Not by a long shot.

No, no, no. You misunderstand Proof of Reserves.
If I deposit 1 BTC and you deposit 1 BTC and the exchange posts a (properly done) proof of its BTC reserves, then we will each be able to verify that *our coin* is still held by the exchange. They could not lend out one of our coins and then post a PoR using the coin they have left to trick us into thinking that both our coins are held by them.
That is not how it works. I see now that you fundamentally do not understand what Proof of Reserves in cryptocurrency implies. It's fascinating stuff, if you're interested in reading further! Definitely showcases a neat aspect to Bitcoin.

That's a very good question without a straightforward answer. As I understand it, it depends on:
* The cost per transaction of an on-chain transaction on the Bitcoin network (which is **not** that silly "$10-$30" figure which that stupid Blockchain.info chart touts)... somewhere between $0.001 and $0.15
* The number, structure, and usage details of the payment channels used in LN.
If you reuse a payment channel hundreds of times, it's going to make the "cost per transaction" on that payment channel decrease by a huge factor. However, if you set up a payment channel, use it twice, and then close it (bundle it up into an on-chain transaction), it won't have as significant of an impact.

I am genuinely impressed with your response. Good on you for taking a step back to reassess matters.
I have spent a lot of time researching this and verifying it firsthand, and I consider myself fairly well informed on the subject, and I'm always more than happy to discuss it if you want. If any other developers say something that doesn't seem to jive with what I've said, I'd like to hear it and see if I can spot where the issue is.
In any case, I definitely agree that SegWit, alone, isn't going to be enough of a capacity upgrade to breathe easy in Bitcoin, especially since any benefits it provides are going to take a while to materialize. Another redditor pointed out to me recently that he wouldn't be using SegWit transactions for a little while, and perhaps never for high-value transactions, and I realized that I feel the same way. It will take a long while (without any security holes being discovered) before I'm fully convinced that SegWit transactions are as safe as vanilla transactions... and I think this is a common and understandable sentiment. So, it's true that we might not even be seeing 1.6-2MB blocks for a while, even after SegWit is active, because not everyone will want to make SegWit transactions (even if they are cheaper!).
And as a final note, I really hope that SegWit isn't politically blocked by some (perhaps well-meaning) mining pool(s). I don't think it's a silver bullet scaling solution, by any means, but it *does* help in a number of ways, and we have months of rigorous testing data for it. A hard fork to increase the blocksize further is not a bad idea, but we should do it *on top of* SegWit when we do it. At least, that's my opinion.

Bill is a smart guy, and he made some good points. Japan's blessing probably did have an impact, and he's right about the impact of the general lack-of-sellers in the Bitcoin community.
However, I would argue that a *much* bigger factor was **the halvening**. If the market were perfectly rational this would not be expected to have a large effect, **but it's not**, not yet at least. I was among the cadre of folks who was arguing (on a daily basis) that the halvening would have a huge positive impact on the price *in the year or two following its actual occurrence*, based on a few (of what I consider to be fundamentally sound) arguments and the empirical evidence we have regarding the first halvening in 2012 (and the double-bubble of 2013 that followed). It's essentially a supply crunch (or to be more accurate, an *inflation crunch*) that is only truly taken into account once the ball starts rolling, rather than in advance (as the EMH might tempt you to expect).
The halvening was huge, not on "the day of" but in the months that followed, as everyone's coins got that much more precious, relatively speaking.
I'm not going to lie, it's a bit frustrating to see my arguments and predictions (often made years in advance) continually validated, without the rest of the community "waking up" to that fact. Some of us have been on-the-dot, explaining what is coming and our reasoning on why exactly we expect it to be so, while newcomers (and old-time naysayers alike) keep dismissing what we say, by and large.
Called the bubble in 2013, called the reason it would pop, called the bubble in 2017, called the pop, and still getting ignored or mocked to this day. Weird feeling. Oh well!

Well, I understand making the claim that "The entire world population can't use Bitcoin at once, provided nothing changes between now and the time that they all adopt it" but that's not the same as saying "A currency network is impossible with the current technology."

Bottom line: everyone parsing everyone else's smart contracts incurs a cost. In order for someone to bear that cost, they must have an incentive to do so. There is no meaningful incentive to do so when you can solve the same exact problem *without* everyone parsing everyone else's smart contracts, minimizing costs and achieving identical results.
Bitcoin makes sense, because there is a careful balance of incentives; mining is an open competition for a monetary reward, and the cost of performing an attack is (almost tautologically) higher than the reward for participating honestly in the open competition. It's cost effective for some people or organizations to mine, so they do. In Ethereum, there is no such balance of incentives. The design is basically "Let's do Google Apps Engine... *on a blockchain!!!*" which isn't the least bit cost effective or economic.
Of course, people like to pump pennycoins, and their Foundation has really good PR, and people in general don't really appreciate the value that a blockchain *does* add, so the mere pump of the token has been enough to obfuscate the fact that the design fundamentally makes no sense... but watch it over a long term. You'll see what I'm talking about, but it will take years to play out. Ultimately the truth has a way of unraveling in the market. If I'm right, and the "everyone computes everyone else's contracts for some reason" model is fundamentally not a cost effective solution, we should see this reflected in the network activity and token value. Stay tuned.

I think if this was an isolated incident, you might be able to make an argument that there was no cause/effect relationship. The real kicker is that the miners were refusing to signal SegWit for *months*, despite the code being available, well-reviewed, and merged... *on three separate coins*. All three of these coins' communities produced UASF code in response, and *in all three cases*, the miners suddenly came together, reached a hasty agreement before the flag day was reached, and activated SegWit as desired. 
Months and months of idle non-signaling (or in the case of Bitcoin, falsely signaling for alts like Unlimited/Classic/etc), followed by a rapid "Okay we have agreed activate SegWit!" agreement right as the respective UASF support materialized...

When you say "The odds are unfair" you are *also* saying "To me, Bizcoins are worth less than Bitcoins." 
In other words, you are currently valuing Bizcoins as *less valuable than Bitcoins*. Your reasoning (at least the component of it that you have explained so far) is that you believe that there is significant risk that the S2X fork *never happens* or otherwise *fails*, which is why you consider a 1:1 trade to be "unfair" and why you are rejecting the offer from OP.
You have proven his point rather well! Everyone else who is refusing the offered trade is doing likewise. We can confidently say that the market (or at least the portion of it here in this thread) is valuing Bizcoins lower than Bitcoins. Hooray!

If you restrict your definition of "support" to only include "miner support" then perhaps (though it still might be arguable, to be frank). But, if you would allow me another hypothetical: if all the miners hypothetically reached 95% support to redistribute the first million bitcoins amongst themselves, and non-mining users unanimously rejected this plan, could you really say that it "cannot be considered contentious"? 
Returning from the realm of the hypothetical to that of reality: if *no* current Bitcoin developers support a given fork, can you honestly claim that it "cannot be considered contentious"? 
Do you believe that non-mining users and stakeholders should have *absolutely no say* in the future of Bitcoin? 


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Finally, neither userbase seems to consider S2X an improvement over the coin of their choice. I don't believe that your argument here can reasonably be considered to still hold, in light of these facts.


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. S2X is really the *only* catalyst for further schism and infighting that remains. 
The risk implicit in this proposal’s hard fork must be said to be necessarily *equal to* the danger of *another* contentious hard fork. 


Again, SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. S2X does not deliver to *either* side "what it desires most" and both sides already *have* paths forward.


SegWit has activated successfully. Bitcoin's best engineers almost unanimously oppose S2X. If you want to invoke their legacy, name, and work, it must necessarily be *in opposition* to the NYA.


SegWit is active. A contentious hard fork has already occurred. Greater transaction capacity has already been achieved for both sides. S2X can *only* serve to divide further, it fundamentally *cannot* unite the community given today's context.
I have gone through and thoroughly explained why the reasoning in this blog post (which may once have been valid) is no longer relevant nor valid. In fact, almost every argument you made in the article can now be said to apply equally well *in opposition to S2X*. 
I understand that you have another argument in favor of supporting S2X, which ultimately represents "keeping your word" and I do not want to argue that for now. I am simply trying to address the reasoning *in this article*, because I have seen you link to it many times as a form of "defense" of S2X but I believe that in all honesty, it no longer can reasonably be termed as such.
I believe that you are an honest and sincere man, and I hope very much that you acknowledge and reflect on what I have said here. If you assess this situation maturely and honorably, I believe that you will reach the same conclusions that I have laid out above (and if not, I would be very interested to hear your exact reasoning).

That's up for you to decide; there is not really such a thing as "objectively fair betting odds" on things more complex than coinflips. 
What you are indicating is that you *do not* believe the offer is fair, which means that you believe that Bizcoins are worth *less* than Bitcoins. Part of this is due to the fact that you apparently do not believe that the fork will successfully occur (which means that you would be assuming extra risk by taking the bet, resulting in you discounting the "fair value" of Bizcoins to some value lower than 1 BTC).
In other words, if you think the bet is *not* fair, that is *the exact same* as you saying "I value Bitcoins more than I do Bizcoins." You cannot get around that.

 I want to say that "shouting your Satoshi theories from the mountaintops" is disrespectful to begin with.
Doing research into the subject is great and all, but show some respect, man. Even if you *did* figure it out, aren't you doing Satoshi a disservice by trying to draw attention to your revelation?
Second, you're almost certainly wrong. Namely, the "Hal Finney was part of Satoshi" bit doesn't make any sense.
[As I just wrote, less than a day ago](






To follow this up, see [this comment]( where I elaborate on why "Finney collaborated with Szabo" Is an unnecessary complication to the theory, which makes far less sense than Szabo being Satoshi himself. Really, it just doesn't add up.
I notice that you haven't really explained why you think Hal Finney was involved, except for a misremembered "offer to help code it" incident which never actually occurred:


This isn't what actually happened. What *did* happen is that Nick Szabo said [in a comment]( "I suspect this is all obscure enough that (a) it may require most people to sit down and work it out for themselves carefully before it can be well understood, and (b) it would greatly benefit from a demonstration, an experimental market (with e.g. a trusted third party substituted for the complex security that would be needed for a real system). Anybody want to help me code one up?" The [2005 post]( was a separate post entirely, and didn't include the comment/request (you're basically mentally conflating the two posts).
Notice that Hal Finney didn't actually chime in on either post (though it's worth noting that he did implement RPOW to begin with, and had been discussing ecash and Bitcoin-like protocols with Szabo as far back as the early 90s), and there are archives of both this post and the blog sitemap available as far back as 2006 which corroborate this. If the comment(s) were available before then, and then Szabo scrubbed the mentions any time after 2007, it would be visible in the archvies, like the "re-dating the bit gold post" is ([see here](
In short, the theory that "Szabo is Satoshi" makes a lot of sense. The theory that "Hal Finney was also part of it" doesn't, really, because Hal was contributing as Hal, and whoever was piloting the Satoshi account(s) was clearly also the author of the code.

It's not even that far out of a coincidence at all... they weren't next-door-neighbors or anything, and in fact there's no evidence the two men even knew each other.

What does "cost on the network" mean? You're going to have to define that term there, because as you're using it now it's highly ambiguous. My best guess for what you mean is "the maximum blocksize allowed", judging from context, but it doesn't make any sense to say SegWit has a higher "cost on the network" than any other type of blocksize increase (e.g. a hardfork). 
Also, by the way, you have to capitalize the "B" in "MB", otherwise it stands for "megabit"... and the maximum blocksize is already 8 Mb large, if that's the unit you want to use. It kind of highlights how little you understand about what you're talking about when you confuse your units like this; that's not the type of mistake that people who understand software development make. 
Speaking of obvious mistakes that highlight how little you know about what you're talking about...


All signature data is witness data. This means that essentially **every single Bitcoin transaction ever** includes a significant amount of witness data.


I re-read this sentence about three times before I was satisfied that it makes absolutely no sense. "People will be able to produce about 1.7Mb of transaction before the first quota fills up"? What is "the first quota" supposed to mean? What are you even trying to communicate here?
If the intent was to say that "With the typical transaction profile seen on the network today, it's likely that the average blocks on a fully-SegWit-friendly network would be about 1.7MB in size", then yes, that is correct. Of course, that would not be "filling up" any imaginary "first quota", whatever that is supposed to mean, but surely you'll be enlightening all of us here with your translation shortly.

He just answered this. It's an almost perfectly competitive market, and marginal cost of transaction inclusion approaches zero. This *is* the answer to your question, but you need a freshman-in-highschool's understanding of economics to recognize it.


They have...


You mean back before there were enough transactions to fill 1MB every 10 minutes? Well, obviously because not enough transactions were being made to fill the blocks... what an inane question.


In a typical Chinese mining pool, &gt;40% of the hashrate is actually located outside of China. You are quite mistaken on this point, by the pool operators' own admission.
But it's true that if we naively removed the 1MB limit, it would induce a strong centralizing effect on the network due to the phenomenon being discussed here. You're right about that. Good thing the limit is in place.


Haha, a brief stop by will show just how hilariously false of a claim this is.


The funny thing is, is *always* wrong. Pretty much entirely without exception. It is the ultimate contrarian indicator. Right now, the party line in that sub is "SegWit won't activate because 95% agreement can't be reached without ViaBTC's consent" so we can know with reasonable certainty that SegWit will activate just fine on mainnet.

A few things to note here. Bitcoin is technically *disinflationary* at this time, if we're talking about supply inflation (which is distinct from *deflationary*). If you're talking about price deflation, then you are arguing that "any moron should be able to see that Bitcoin will go up in price" which is not at all true, and a point of massive dispute (and if it *were* so obvious, we would see effectively-immediate hyperbitcoinization as a result). Most people *don't* believe that Bitcoin is going to continue rising in price (despite its supply growth curve) and this is absolutely a niche opinion right now. Of course, most people don't have "a correct understanding of monetary economics" either, but that brings us to yet *another* point: such a thing probably does not objectively exist, anyway.
So many little giveaways in this tiny sentence... I remember when the trolls used to show glimmers of intelligence.  Better times.


It's not the sole factor, no, and I never made that claim.


There's a bit of that going on, too. But it's a slow process, and it's more like "cosmic Bitcoin background radiation" that is more useful for years-to-decades price extrapolations than it is for the near- or mid-term. 


Not sure what you're trying to mock, exactly. I didn't call the exact top of the 2013 bubble, but I called that the bubble would occur (and pass $1000, due to a East-West "feedback loop" because China was finally starting to play the Bitcoin game) when the price was still hovering above $100, and correctly predicted that the most likely end of the cycle would be caused by regulatory/legislative clamp-down (remember the "China bans Bitcoin!" scares, anyone?)... and more recently, when redditors asked me "Can you share some of your future predictions" [I said](


Note that despite never having claimed to be able to call an exact top, the "$20k top" is right there, the exact middle prediction, made while the price was still in the $11k range. Note also that I included a disclaimer warning readers that the prediction wasn't precisely tradeable, and though I nailed the order of magnitude pretty impressively (and even got the timeframe eerily right), it wasn't a prediction that allows you to base your day trades perfectly on.
Going back to even older posts, I was arguing that we'd very likely see prices north of $10k within 2 years of the 2016 halvening, *over a year before the halvening occurred*, so let's just get that out of the way now and save you from some doomed goalpost-shifting nonsense before it begins.


Not only is that a ridiculous conclusion in the first place and basically just childish hyperbole, but you have no idea what my financial situation is like and I have no intention of being baited by an obvious troll into disclosing it anyway.
Like I said, these predictions are publicly verifiable for anyone who cares to check (or even ask), but instead of curiosity or recognition I am more often met with crude and ignorant attempts at derision, of which you're an excellent example.

Basically, [Roger Ver has been spending a lot of money to try to misrepresent altcoins *as* Bitcoin]( and though there's not any "smoking gun" proof on the matter, there's a lot of reason to believe that he essentially bought the  Twitter handle (like he did with bitcoin(dot)com and [very likely did with the subreddit](

Whether or not anyone chooses to contribute to Bitcoin development is up to them. There isn't an obvious "money-grab" opportunity when it comes to just rolling up your sleeves and writing code (or offering peer review, or testing, or documentation, or any other type of technical contribution) for Bitcoin, though... so the most obvious explanation here is that Vitalik was more interested in the rewards for launching (not to mention governing) an altcoin than he was in helping with Bitcoin protocol development.
He wrote some (fairly simple) Bitcoin-oriented Python tools and a minimal library, but that's all he ever tried to do in this department. His choice to do an ICO (and from then on to actively deride Bitcoin whenever he got the chance in what seems to be an underhanded effort at promoting his own platform) is lamentable, but speaks more to his quality-of-character (or lack thereof) than anything else.
Also, just for the record and while we're on the subject, Satoshi pretty much said "Let's *not* try and turn Bitcoin into something generalized like Ethereum, because that [doesn't scale]( and we can always do cross-chain atomic swaps if we really need to." So the whole idea of "making Bitcoin into an Ethereum-like protocol" was shot down by Satoshi years before Vitalik even started paying attention to cryptocurrency... if he wanted to pursue building such a network, that's his right, but let's not pretend like "if we were nicer, we could have prevented Ethereum from existing" (or even like that would be a desirable outcome). Ethereum has a lot of warts that we're lucky Bitcoin does not suffer from (though it certainly has its own).


Cobra is a purely-pseudonymous actor in the space who inexplicably was handed (effectively) "final say" over the content of bitcoin.org, which has served as the "de facto official Bitcoin site" since the beginning of the project. At least some of his accounts were compromised a while back, and we have no way of knowing whether control was ever regained by the "original Cobra" (or even who that is, or what their qualifications are). The current controller of (at least some) of Cobra's social accounts seems to enjoy attention and stirring up drama, and many people are uncomfortable with the seeming influence that such a divisive entity might theoretically destructively wield if they were so inclined, especially because we have no proof (or even evidence) that the account(s) haven't fallen into "the wrong hands" (as they did before, and where they very conceivably could have remained). Cobra is not responsible (as far as we know) for the creation or launch of any altcoins, though, so once again, your "I wonder how many altcoins we can breed" statement doesn't really make any sense in this context, and it looks more like you're trolling than like you're trying to contribute something meaningful here.

Not only are multisig and payment channels excellent examples of smart contracts, but technically *every single Bitcoin transaction* is a smart contract, believe it or not, because of how the Bitcoin Script system works.
Each transaction is basically a "reassignment of conditions that must be fulfilled to 'spend' a certain UTXO" and though most are of the (relatively simple) form: "allow spending if a valid signature corresponding to public key XYZ accompanies the output", under-the-hood this is expressed in a much more versatile Script language than you might initially expect.
I think the point you're trying to make (which, if you don't mind me paraphrasing, is something like "fully Turing-expressive smart contracting capabilities are massively overrated and overhyped relative to their utility versus much simpler and more practical smart contracts like Bitcoin's transactions") is totally valid, though. It's true that "smart contracts" is basically a buzzword these days, and most of the "flashy" examples that jump to mind are pretty ridiculous when you take a close look at them.

I am saying that "Market Cap is pretty much a meaningless metric entirely".
Interestingly enough, I think that Bitcoin and Litecoin (and Monero) are probably three of the coins from which you might be able to *somewhat* compare the relative market caps of (and get sorta-kinda decent results from)... but that's because all three of these coins are "true fair launch" coins. If you include other altcoins (*any* of the "Top 30" altcoins other than these three) then suddenly the market cap comparison becomes **totally** ridiculous, and essentially completely meaningless. So if you asked the question with "ETH" in the place of "LTC" I would answer "Yes, the market cap comparison means basically nothing" *even though ETH has the second largest market cap in crypto*, because the figures are highly misleading (and in the case of ETH, gamed to a significant degree). Comparing the (few and far between) fair launch coins is *slightly* different, but that's not what this chart depicts, anyway.
The point is that "it doesn't matter if the figure is big if it can be gamed"; my comment(s) above should show that it can be gamed *even to the point to where the coin is "bigger than Bitcoin".*

Okay, but you're not appreciating what I'm telling you, which is that **market cap is a joke of a metric in the first place**.
I can release a new ERC20 token named "MarketCapJokeCoin" which has a supply of 100,000,000,000,000 tokens, and then sell one of those tokens for $1 to a friend of mine. My coin's market cap now represents well over **99%** of the "Total Crypto Market Cap" figure, and reduces Bitcoin's share (even by your silly "top 5 only" measurement) to &lt;0.1%.
Does this mean my coin is really that important? No, obviously not.
And before you reply with "But CoinMarketCap might not list your coin" or something ridiculous like that, realize that this isn't an actual, meaningful argument... I could bribe them, or I could work harder to make my "market cap manipulation" less obvious / more subtle, like other altcoins and tokens do... the point still stands. The principle has been demonstrated.
**The "market cap" metric is bunk, period.** It's gameable, and gamed (to varying degrees). That's that.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:47:55
Yes, I agree with that. More adoption means more liquidity which means less drastic price swings.
And since you're not trying to make fun of other people (on a regular basis) on the basis of them "not understanding economics" while pretending to be a super amazing incredible economist yourself, and you are willing (and gracious) enough to admit a tiny terminological oversight, my opinion of you is that *you're a cool dude who seems good-hearted, friendly, and reasonably intelligent*.

@_date: 2018-04-08 17:04:10
The whole point I'm making is that the "market cap" figure is a joke, and easily gameable by coins/tokens that purposefully set out to game it. Bitcoin is *obviously* not one of these, and is the quintessential "fair launch" coin which lies on the exact opposite end of the "gaming the metric" spectrum. You've misunderstood my point severely.
Beyond that, the "relative trading restriction" doesn't particularly matter; there are dozens of obvious ways to game the metric, like airdropping initial supplies or skewing the mining rewards (arbitrarily extremely) towards the launch period. The principle is what's important, and you're allowing it to soar far over your head.
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:07:18
Not on a large scale, because the whole reason Bitcoin works is because the cost to attack (double-spend) outweighs the cost to play fair and honest.
If price drops too much, but people are still trying to use colored coins to make big-ticket transactions in some way, they are vulnerable to a 51% attack and successful double-spend because it costs so little to do so. It would only be a matter of time before this was exploited.

The [Great Chinese Feedback Loop]( post, made when bitcoins were around $160 each, shows my reasoning on the latter 2013 bubble (and predicting what I considered to be the only plausible catalyst for why it would eventually pop), which was later validated with the "China bans Bitcoin" nonsense. Earlier comments than that post (in BitcoinMarkets) were discussing the realistic possibility of $1000+ prices on the forthcoming bull-run.
For the "calling the effect of the halvening in advance" corroboration, I once compiled together a really nice list of links to comments that I had made about it, but can't find it right now. Oh well, a quick search turned [this comment from 2015]( [this one]( and [this one (both from 2016) reiterating the logic]( and then [this one]( to hammer the same point home.

In theory, Bitcoin is partition-tolerant, because "the proof of work speaks for itself" and the weaker forks would ultimately be reorganized and orphaned by the strongest one in the event of the network reconnecting or becoming whole again.
In practice, it's likely that other issues would rear their heads. The weaker forks would probably implement protection against such reorganization, for one (which would mean that the split(s) would be permanent), and if enough of the hashpower was divided up, even reaching the next difficulty adjustment block could be problematic and painful, which could conceivably prompt "emergency" updates (e.g. proof-of-work algorithm swapouts).
Network partitions are *no joke* when it comes to distributed consensus. Bitcoin's "answer" boils down to work-proofs, but you're correct to point out that it would be a crazy period with a lot of big unknowns.

The number of bitcoins that an exchange "should" control is the number that have been deposited by depositors. Any depositor can verify that their funds (at least, the Bitcoin portion of them) are under the exchange's control if a valid proof of reserves is published.

I agree, that's a much better metric (as long as you're looking at fee-charging exchanges' volumes), precisely because it would be costly to try to game.
Another metric that might be worth looking at is "network fees paid", because once again, this would cost money to try to inflate. Some cryptocurrencies are now using per-transaction work-proofs in the place of fees, though, which complicates this one... so I think you're right, and that trade volume is probably the best metric we've got available right now.

Yeah, I agree. But I consider most of these to be "abundantly obvious" though... and yet I'm met with people arguing against me or mocking my thoughts pretty much every time I speak up.
I understand the broken clock phenomenon. But just speaking of my own explicit predictions, it's something like 75 proven correct and 3 wrong. Not all of these have to do with the price, though (I'm including stuff like "Segwit will lock in on mainnet before August 1" and "Craig Wright won't actually provide signatures from Satoshi's early private keys like he promised to" and "the 2X fork attempt will not take over and kill the original chain" which are just as often met with loud opposition). Instead of the people who I originally argue against coming around to acknowledge (or even apologize) when my statements are eventually validated, in the vast majority of cases they just continue mocking me. On top of that, if it's pointed out that I've been proven correct time and time again, I hear "broken clock!" and sneering even when my logic was carefully laid out to support my arguments, and people saying "well it was *obvious* that what you said was the case" in retrospect despite it having been met with loud (and often vicious) disagreement when I spoke up originally.
It's not really a big deal, just surprises me. I just naturally would have expected a little bit more recognition when things get so regularly validated, but I guess that's not how the real world works.
TL;DR is, I guess: ignore the haters.

Honestly, if the anti-Bitcoin community (who mostly congregate in rbtc these days) wasn't so aggressively dishonest and willing to deliberately misrepresent matters at every available opportunity, I would wholeheartedly support opening the mod logs. As it stands, it would probably just result in a lot more (unjustified but loud) noise out of them, and ultimately do more harm than good.

Though the Craig Wright bits were funny (the [negative gamma]( parts [in particular]( Vitalik apparently [doesn't understand a few things about the Lightning Network]( entering a channel can be totally free for the recipient; the sending party simply funds it. Also, it's pretty obvious that he is trying to legitimize [arguments that aren't actually legitimate]( "what makes something sound money" is being backed by a (scarce) commodity (or actually being a commodity itself) and thus not susceptible to arbitrary levels of emission/inflation by a central governing agency. Ver likes to [mock people about having "no understanding of economics"]( and try (pathetically hard) to [brag about his own knowledge of economics]( but this is a demonstration of him showing *just how little he knows*; he doesn't even have a grasp of basic terminology! To see him say stuff like this (and see Vitalik "agree") is facepalm-inducing, to say the least.

...is far less than half of the subscriber count to this subreddit, proving my point? Not to mention the fact that subscriber counts are trivial to game (reddit accounts don't cost anything to register, after all), and if you look at [hourly active users, the subreddit sticks out like a sore thumb]( not fluctuating regularly at all, indicating that most of the subscribers there are likely sockpuppets and bots (and its figures are massively inflated relative to subreddits that see actual organic or legitimate visits/activity).
Meanwhile, on metrics that are more expensive to game (like hashrate or price), the splinter group doesn't even seem able to sustain *10%* of the actual Bitcoin values... and even on gameable metrics like "total transaction volume" the same picture is painted.

The quote is "Roger: I think transactions/usage is what *makes* something sound money" which is just false. And no, you're incorrect, money is not "more sound if more people are using it" and all that shows is that you don't know what "sound money" means.
One of the *critiques* that has been historically leveled against sound money is that it is *prone* to swings in value (because its value is fundamentally market-driven rather than stabilized by some intervening or fiddling government); that's arguably the biggest rationalization for *why* modern governments pretty much all use fiat money instead of sound money. Whether this "stabilization" is truly sustainable (or even worthwhile to pursue) over the long-term is another subject entirely, my only point here is that Roger, much like you, doesn't seem to understand what the phrase "sound money" actually means in economic parlance. "Sound" isn't just a loose synonym for "good" or anything.
Your "interpretation" would be like arguing to a mathematician "Pi is a *rational number* because circles are perfectly rational geometric shapes, much more 'rational' than silly things like hexagons or octagons, and pi is intimately related to circles!" The phrase "rational number" has an actual meaning in mathematics, and your "argument" in this example would just show that you're not well versed with this meaning.

"Before it has a chance to scale"? 
Bitcoin will scale when there is a reason for it to. The only reason the blocksize hasn't been increased is because there isn't agreement that it should be increased.
If we see a sudden surge in traffic (from Amazon, for instance), it will be quite obvious that an increase makes sense, so we will increase the blocksize.

Satoshi was (pretty clearly) obsessed with identity security, and it seems like he was extremely knowledgeable with regards to informational security. I would find it incredibly surprising if he wasn't aware of (and taking into account) stylometry as a possible vulnerability in terms of identity management.
In light of this, the British spellings and idioms (which he did use very consistently) have never seemed to be that compelling of a data point (at least in my book). Similarly, the "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." embedded in the Genesis Block, which is sometimes cited as evidence that Satoshi lived in the UK, seems like it could just as well be a deliberate red herring.
Committing to a "pretend I'm British" approach would be a very clever way to obscure your identity from determined researchers, and I don't put it past Satoshi at all. Perhaps I'm overthinking it, but that's my opinion on the subject.
The timezones are tricky, too, and invite another relevant question: what hours did he keep? I know plenty of engineers who do their best work late at night, and depending on his occupation (which is another thing we don't know anything about), his opportunity for "time-slots dedicated to Bitcoin" would have been affected. All of this is hard to guess at. However, one thing worth mentioning is that on the rare situations when a "crisis" would emerge, Satoshi would consistently be fairly quick to respond. He seems to have been able to keep a relatively close eye on Bitcoin's growth during the early years.
I don't personally know where Szabo was employed during this time (and in fact, the general lack of identity information that we have access to about Szabo is a point in favor of the hypothesis that he is Satoshi, if you ask me). The two biggest points *against* this hypothesis are: 1) He has denied it outright, and 2) It seems like if we're going to attribute legendary anonymity-preservation abilities to Satoshi, it's hard to reconcile that with "...except it's pretty easy to guess who he is if you know much about Nick Szabo."
Regardless, both men are geniuses.

"Optimal" in this context meaning "most profitable for the miner in question", not "optimal for Bitcoin at large".
If I were a big mining pool, I might choose 5MB blocks and then include a bunch of heavy-sigop transactions that take 20 minutes to verify. I myself don't have to verify them before building my next block, but the rest of the network sure does. And while they are busy doing so, I'm mining forward. 
Now suddenly, they have two options: join my pool (mine cooperatively with me) to be able to skip the tx verification, like me, or try to mine without verifying the transactions in the blocks that I produce. If they choose the latter option, I'll produce some invalid blocks and publish those alongside my valid ones. Anyone unlucky enough to choose the wrong fork is going to waste all their hashpower mining on an ultimately-doomed chain. So I've just effectively cut their EV in half. 
So that basically leaves one rational choice: consolidation of miners into one pool. Every other option is irrational and unprofitable for the competing miners.
I'm better informed than the market because I understand the above. Do you?

I may not be getting the point you're trying to make, though. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:03:46
Well, that's an interesting way to phrase it. I'm glad you brought that up, because it really *is* the important point: the point is not to increase the maximum block size (which SegWit *does* do), the point is to increase *capacity*! We should be having discussions about *capacity*, and framing our arguments regarding SegWit and how it helps or hurts in terms of achieving maximum capacity in that context. The maximum allowed block size is just *one* aspect of capacity, and even though we're going from a 1MB maximum blocksize to a 4MB maximum blocksize with SegWit, is that *enough* capacity for Bitcoin to meaningfully succeed? On top of that, if we can save 40% of space in other ways, like clever new signature mechanisms, will *that* be enough to achieve the sort of capacity we all want?
I don't think it will, not immediately. SegWit isn't *enough* on its own to solve scalability, long-term. No blocksize increase will be. We know that. So we have to think beyond that, and try to think out the very smartest way to scale Bitcoin. I'm talking about order-of-magnitude improvements. Those are the conversations we need to be focusing our efforts on. Those are the game changers. We need to concentrate all of our firepower into solving the order-of-magnitude solutions. We have to judge which ones we think are the smartest, based on the technical merits of the solution and the design constraints of maintaining a massively distributed online censor-resistant consensus ledger of money that we call The Blockchain, and we have to flesh them out and check over every nook and cranny of them, prioritize them, and get them done.
You're right: this is a problem of *capacity*, not of block sizes.

The witness data is indeed separate from the other data (hence the "segregated" in "segregated witness") but it's still part of the block. The Merkle root is included in the coinbase transaction and the full witness data transmitted alongside the rest of the block. Non-upgraded nodes would not recognize (thus don't receive) the witness data, so from their perspective, the block is just a normal 1MB-capped block with a weird hash in the coinbase. Upgraded nodes recognize and parse it all.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:52:19
No, that's not true. The usable size is 2.7MB larger. That's why there are 3.7MB blocks on Testnet.
You can keep trying to spin it as negatively as possible, but first you need to take a moment or two to understand it. You're still making false assertions that indicate you don't understand the capacity increase.
I am going to explain, one final time, what the 1.7MB figure represents. You can ignore me if you want, but until you understand this point, you will always look uninformed to people who do, and it will be very hard for intelligent people to take you seriously.
SegWit is a blocksize increase to 4MB. However, 3MB of this is reserved for the witness data (the signature data) of the transactions. If a lot of very-signature-heavy transactions (like multisig transactions) are made, then it is possible to use almost all 4MB available (effectively, in practice, it maxes out at 3.7MB blocks). However, most transactions being made today are *not* multisig transactions. If we take a random typical block today, pluck out all the transactions in it, and re-craft them as SegWit-style transactions, the odds are that we'll be able to fit 60-100% more per block than we can fit without SegWit (i.e. we'd see 1.6-2MB blocks if everyone were using SegWit for their transactions and nothing else changed).
So, to recap: the maximum size that blocks can be after SegWit goes live is 3.7MB. There is nothing illusory about this figure; if a 3.7MB block shows up, that block really does contain 3.7MB of transaction data, and in a non-SegWit network it would take 4 blocks to include/process all those transactions. But this is in extreme cases, where almost all the transactions are heavily signature-intensive. If we instead assume that most transactions remain exactly how they are today, except formatted for SegWit, then we're likely to see somewhere between 60% and 100% more transactions fitting in each block; the best estimates I've personally seen puts the figure at around 80% (1.8MB blocks).
Of course, if people don't actually need more capacity, they don't need to use SegWit. And miners are, naturally, free to mine at a soft cap figure (like how they were mostly mining blocks &lt;750kB until a few months ago, even though 1MB blocks were possible). But SegWit *allows* this further capacity, unambiguously.

That is incredibly incorrect.
Bitcoin has been through [quite a few bubbles]( The first few peaked 3-4 months apart (and found their respective floors even quicker than that). The next bear market took longer to find its floor, and the following bubble didn't peak until almost 2 years after the preceding one, but the price found its floor less than 5 months after the bubble peaked in mid-2011. Then we had 2 bubbles in 2013 (peaking 8 months apart and with the market finding its bottom in less than 5), and then we had to wait almost 4 years to see another bubble peak (though the market found its floor after about 1 year, in early 2015).
Your guesswork is wrong. It's definitely possible that the current bear market lasts a while, but historically, the market has found its footing far quicker than you seem to think.

If the person asking the question is knowledgeable enough to realize that routing in such a context is a tricky issue, then they should be able to understand an appropriate answer, e.g. "For a small or medium sized network, a global route table can be maintained; for larger and more complex/mature networks, it gets trickier, but a few rounds of 'six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon' will demonstrate that the problem is much more tractable than you might intuitively assume."

The thread that was from was full of remarkable insight and prescience. [Hal's original thread-starting email]( is discussing (and lamenting) how payee anonymity is hard to preserve because of the double-spend problem, and at the end he concludes:


It's amazing to see these legends discussing Bitcoin so many years before its launch. Hal eventually created RPOW, too, which is (essentially) the ingredient missing from the recipe back in the 90s.
Another thing that stuck out to me while reading this is the fact that they use the word "coin" to refer to ecash payments (including Szabo, in the email you linked). The whole "bitcoin/bitgold" naming overlap is already a compelling data point itself; combine it with the fact that Szabo was using the "coin" parlance for over a decade and you have a *really* hard-to-ignore point. And then on top of all of that, you have the "pseudonym" email you linked to earlier, where Szabo describes the difficulty in avoiding leaving "pointers to your True Name"...
Honestly, you've performed some really remarkably astute research here, and I think I'm more convinced than I've ever been that Szabo is Satoshi. I had gone from convinced to skeptical to ambivalent and now (largely thanks to you) I'm back to convinced.
I've read a few of Szabo's essays here and there, but it's usually been fairly casual reading (not like the way I've obsessively combed through what Satoshi wrote). In the next few weeks, I think I'm going to take a deeper dive. If I find anything especially noteworthy, I'll be sure to send it your way.

This is actually factually incorrect. It indicates a very deep misunderstanding of how SegWit works.
If you took all the transactions from a SegWit block that is 3.7MB large, and formatted them as normal (non-SegWit) transactions, do you know how much space they would take up? 3.7MB of space.
SegWit is a blocksize increase, so saying it "a very poor solution compared to growing the block size" is self-contradictory; it does do exactly that. It just doesn't require a hard fork to increase the max blocksize.

It doesn't "eliminate" any type of covert ASICBoost (as the link you just provided explains). It makes it clunkier and/or less efficient (motivating a miner to mine empty blocks, or at least blocks lacking Segwit transactions, if they want to exploit at anything close to reasonable efficiency).

The theory I'm doubting is that it was Hal Finney *and* Nick Szabo collaborating as Satoshi, and some of the supportive reasoning I've provided is that Szabo was discussing the importance of *not* linking your pseudonym to your True Name if you're trying to keep your identity secure, even as far back as the early 90s.

No, you're trying to change the argument and what he said, and you're actually voicing a *separate* misunderstanding here yourself.
Vitalik's exact quote:


Note those last 12 words: "you can't **collect a payment for the first time** if it's smaller"; Vitalik is talking about *receiving* a payment smaller than 10000 satoshis, and arguing that it's impossible. He is wrong, because you absolutely can collect a payment smaller than that, if someone establishes a payment channel with an address you control on the other end, starting your balance off at something smaller than 10000 satoshis.
In any case, your (different, changed) argument is still wrong, because again, the sender (i.e. the party funding the channel) can set up the initial channel balance as described above. Even if the fee for doing so exceeds the initial amount granted to the counterparty on the other end, the whole point of Lightning Network is that the on-chain fees paid to enter/fund/top-up/close channels are able to be amortized over arbitrary-length chains of transactions, reducing the effective "per-transaction fee" to an infinitesimal figure in the process.
Essentially, if you're going to be closing the channels immediately/shortly after opening them, you're not taking advantage of the benefits the Lightning Network offers. And sure, you can come with hundreds of ways to "not use Lightning very intelligently" if you want to, they're just not that interesting or noteworthy.
Nice try there, though.

Yes, it is.


Yes, that's the point. It demonstrates how silly the "market cap" figure is, and why it shouldn't be taken seriously at all.


Nope, not at all. [It has been abused in various ways]( because there are [very easy]( ways to game the metric, and because it is a nice, singular, quantifiable number that many people (naively) take seriously, there are serious incentives to actually do so. Over time, a number of [surprisingly effective techniques]( have arisen, all natural responses to this set of incentives.
You clearly haven't spent much time thinking about this.


It's just as bunk as "measuring the sizes of physical coins to guess what their values are"; quarters are bigger than pennies and nickels, but **oops**, dimes ruin the whole thing. You could say "in this scenario, it's still not 'bunk' because it's just a metric" but you'd be just as wrong: it's a metric, *and* it's definitely bunk.


That's *not* obvious, because the market cap figure is essentially meaningless due to how gameable it is. You're trying to have the cake and eat it, too; if you argue that the metric is not gameable, then this hypothetical buyer should trust the fact that the coin earned a $100 trillion market cap... if they are able to "obviously see" that the coin doesn't deserve that market cap, you just admitted that the metric is completely gameable.

You can actually see a [bunch of 3.7MB blocks on Testnet]( where SegWit is active already. It is a fact that the max blocksize, with SegWit active, is 4MB. You simply cannot deny this when I have linked you to 3.7MB blocks in a SegWit-active network. 
From the quote you yourself have linked to:


So if you want to talk about "max blocksize" then the figure is 4MB. If you want to talk about "effective limit in practice, given the current typical transaction profile on the network" then the 1.6 to 2MB figure is relevant. But we were talking about the maximum blocksize, which is unambiguously 4MB in SegWit. I mean, again, go look at the 3.7MB blocks I have linked you to. Click through them! Explore them! You'll find 3.7MB worth of transaction data there to pore over!
I'm not "quoting a 4MB value", I have verified the code diffs myself. I ran a SegNet node before it was even available on the main Testnet, so I could see what was what. I verify things firsthand, you see. So I know for a fact exactly what SegWit does to the blocksize, and I have blocks on my hard drive to prove it. 


So the best proposal you have is "let's fiddle with this arbitrary limit and introduce a new one"? Rather than solving the problem cleanly? Even though pretty much every expert agrees that this is a dumb and clunky approach?


No, it couldn't. Not without segregating the witness data. *That's the point.*

Who ever said that storage costs were the biggest concern? I don't think I've heard any competent developers (and certainly no Core contributors) voice concerns over storage costs foremost; bandwidth, for instance, is a much more pertinent concern.
Besides that, the *real* centralization concerns come into play with a **floating** blocksize, especially if it's not properly incentive-aligned (i.e. if there is no cost to bloating your blocks as a miner). That's where things get real ugly under hypothetical adversarial conditions.
In other words, you may not realize it, but you're creating a strawman here, and massively misrepresenting the concerns of Bitcoin's engineers.

The community was never "torn in half", a small fraction (comprised almost entirely of the most antagonistic, illogical, and dishonest members) splintered off to make their own altcoin, while the remaining Bitcoiners (the vast majority) increased the limit intelligently and are continuing along just fine.

Szabo has a degree in Computer Science so he is definitely capable of programming, and is just as cypherpunk as Finney.
The big problem with the "Hal wrote the code" theory is that whoever piloted the Satoshi mouthpieces (that is to say, whoever "spoke as Satoshi in all the emails and forum posts") was quite obviously one person with a consistent voice, and this person quite obviously knew the code backwards and forwards, inside and out. Whoever was doing the public speaking was *also* doing the programming; check out Satoshi's BitcoinTalk account history and this becomes very clear very quickly. 95%+ of the posts are technical in nature and regarding esoteric minutae, and yet are spoken in the same "voice" and expressed in an unwaveringly-consistent way.
So it becomes a question of "Well if Hal was writing the code, then what was Nick doing?" and this should be a clue that you took a wrong turn somewhere along the way.
But Hal *did* contribute code to Bitcoin. He did so as Hal Finney, [using his "halfinney" account]( The theory that he was "part of Satoshi" just doesn't make any sense, and doesn't answer any questions satisfactorily.
Meanwhile, Szabo was writing [back in 1993]( about his own struggles in terms of keeping his pseudonyms secured properly, and discussing tools and techniques to "avoid leaving pointers to my True Name lying around -- excess **mail to/from my True Name**, shared files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable logins, etc."
If Finney and Szabo *were* collaborating as Satoshi, it seems pretty obvious that Szabo would have strongly discouraged Finney from chiming in too early on the initial mailing list announcement, and from being the "first ever recipient of a Bitcoin transaction"... that stuff would just be *sloppy* beyond the point of tolerability, and directly violate the "avoid pointers to your True Name" principle that Szabo was so concerned with.
Again, the "Hal Finney was part of it" theory doesn't withstand any serious scrutiny, in my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong, but to me it seems silly and contrived.

You will want to read [On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward]( to properly understand the issue. In a nutshell: transaction fees have to replace the mining reward as the primary incentive powering and motivating Bitcoin mining. If there aren't more transactions waiting for confirmation than can fit in the next block, it will be more profitable and rational for miners to ignore each others' blocks and try to claim the fees themselves. The only known solution to this problem is a perpetual backlog of transactions (i.e. demand for scarce block space exceeds supply of it), in which context the incentives powering Bitcoin remain intact.
Don't worry, though, this doesn't mean that you will be forced to pay a million dollars to confirm each Bitcoin transaction you make. We can implement additional layers to the blockchain stack to get the best of all worlds (faster/instant confirmations, low fees, and high security) and allow self-interested participants to make the tradeoffs that make the most sense for whatever it is they are doing. 
If you're interested in learning more about this sort of scaling, read up on the [Lightning Network]( model.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:21:29


Yes, this is a valid model in some ways, but it also might tempt you towards some false conclusions in some contexts. For instance, if you're thinking in terms of a completely fixed supply (i.e. taking the model to the extreme), and suddenly hundreds of thousands of DPR coins are seized and auctioned off to the market, you might want to say "oh those coins won't have an effect on the price, because supply didn't really increase, they were there all along!" This is naive, and demonstrates that when it comes to evaluating price (and its potential movement) it is important to distinguish between *circulating* or *available supply* and *total supply*; the former is inflationary, the latter (perhaps mildly) deflationary... and the former is the relevant figure.


Again, if your prerequisite includes that this prediction is correct, this is a (perhaps impossibly) high bar to set.


Let's be clear here: most of my predictions do not necessarily concern the price (at least not directly). Stuff like "Segwit will lock in on mainnet before August 1", "Craig Wright won't provide signatures using Satoshi's private keys despite his promises to do so", "2x won't take over and kill the original chain" and other similar contextually-relevant arguments make up the majority of my "prediction portfolio", and price-related ones are a tiny fraction of it.


Again, it's not always (or even "usually") price action that validates what I say. And while you're (mostly) correct that it's usually impossible to "prove causality beyond a doubt", in every case I'm willing to expound thoroughly on my reasoning and logic, discuss and consider opposing perspectives (and explain the specifics of why I ultimately disagree with them), and lay out my thoughts in advance of the event(s) in question. When dozens and dozens of these sorts of arguments have their conclusions proven true over the months and years as virtually *none* of them are proven false, despite the fact that in every case a significant chunk of people disagreed with me at the time, it's hard to seriously argue that this is "survivorship bias and nothing else"; the logic is there, laid-out and visible to the world, and well-defended when the situation calls for it. Ignore or dismiss this all you want, but realize you're just (ironically) proving me correct in the process.


Okay, I'm willing to hear out your full argument here. Why, exactly, do you think Mercury's transit will have this specific effect on Bitcoin's price? Have you backtested historical market data and found a convincing correlation? Do you have *any* supportive arguments whatsoever? Or is this just "a gut feeling"?
Note: I'm not arguing that your conclusion will prove incorrect (though if four years go by and the price stays below $100k, I do think it would be fair to count this as an example of "you being wrong"). Though you don't have an impressive track record that I am aware of and have not demonstrated particularly strong reasoning skills thus far in our discussion, I withhold judgment on the quality of the argument/prediction entirely until I've heard the details behind it.

@_date: 2016-10-26 19:31:20


This makes no sense. Any finite blocksize will have the "problem" of a transaction backlog. This, in fact, is not a problem at all, it is a sign that Bitcoin is useful and that the immutability, finitude, and censorship-resistance it offers (the primary value-adds that Bitcoin boasts) are valuable enough to generate significant demand for access to the Blockchain.
If you go increase the max blocksize to 1000x what it is right now, I could use a script to spam a bunch of fee-free transactions to fill that space up no problem. But there are real, clear costs to such an increase, and they are fundamentally at odds with the properties of Bitcoin that make it valuable in the first place.
The blocksize is not important at all. Capacity is reasonably important (no more important than fungibility or censorship-resistance or plenty of other properties, but important nonetheless), and the brightest engineers in the space have absolutely incredible plans for increasing capacity without threatening the underlying technology's core tenets. The *other* sub is actually anti-Bitcoin and will take every opportunity they can get to spout crazy conspiracy theories, general technological ignorance, and regularly-debunked fallacious arguments. Their sub is more for promoting altcoins than helping Bitcoin scale (and has been for a while now), but of course they would never admit it.

If you were a superhero, you would be Non-Sequitur Man.
Let's, for the moment, set aside the fact that "how many time did you used payment channel" is borderline unintelligible. Let's also set aside the fact that "how many time did you used payment channel" is, logically, a total non sequitur in the context of the discussion, because "how many time did you used payment channel" isn't, in the slightest, a reasonable metric by which a rational individual can gauge how comparatively critical the routing component of Lightning Network is. And finally, let's set aside the fact that at this time pretty much all working payment channel solutions are PoCs, only available on testnets, and/or trusty in design; that is to say, not actually intended for general use on mainnet yet.
Even having set *all* of that aside, we're still left with the fact that "without routing LN is useless" is *completely missing the point of the comment you replied to*. It's almost impressive how much of a *whoosh* this moment represents. Let me break this down for you...
When someone makes a claim (like "Lightning Network could support thousands of transactions per second") and then explains directly why that point is true (like "Lightning Network is made up of payment channels, which individually can handle thousands and thousands of transactions per second because they ultimately only require 2 blockchain settlement transactions"), you should do your very best to understand what that person has said before you start responding. In some cases, as here, you'll blurt out a response that isn't relevant to the point at hand. That's okay, it happens. But then, if that person explains "What you just said isn't relevant to the point here" and goes on to clarify why exactly that's the case, you will find you have two options before you. You can either spend a moment considering the possibility that you misunderstood the situation or argument, and try to find out where exactly you went wrong, *or* you can again brutishly respond without bothering to understand what it is you're missing.
You have apparently chosen the latter option. It is not the one I would have recommended. So here's another chance, big guy, you can do this. Want to take a step back and go over the conversation again, see if you can spot where you *whoosh*ed? How about giving it a try?

Lightning Network is particularly suited for relatively frequent, low-value payments. For larger transaction amounts, direct on-chain (channel-less) payments make more economic sense; Lightning is not designed or optimized for this particular use case.
A 5+ BTC capacity on Lightning Network is more than enough (some might even argue it is *overkill*), at least for the vast majority of its intended usage.

What? I didn't say that, at all. You should go back and re-read what I have said so far, so that we're on the same page.
Bottom line: if you don't want decentralization, it is cheaper and more efficient to use a database than a blockchain. So much so, in fact, that using a blockchain makes no sense at all.
This is why the "private interbank blockchain" is such a naive idea. What would be a good idea, instead, is to use a private interbank database with proper permissions/access settings applied. People who don't know much about software typically say "Oh they'll use a blockchain for its magical efficiency and cost-savings!" without realizing that a database is better for both of those things.

Bitcoin is e-cash. If you need e-cash, it's the best tool for the job. It's also digital gold. If you want digital gold, you want Bitcoin.
The answer to "What is Bitcoin" definitely will vary depending on who you ask. If you ask an uninformed troll, they might start ranting about ponzi schemes or eating dog food for dinner, whereas if you ask a reasonable and well-informed person, they might explain that Bitcoin is electronic cash built of cryptographic primitives with an issuance schedule inspired by gold mining.

No, Bitcoin's market cap is bigger than Litecoin's market cap, but that doesn't really tell us anything meaningful, **because market cap is a joke of a metric**.
Again, it doesn't become magically meaningful at some arbitrary threshold. Your logic is either bad or nonexistent. The fact that Bitcoin has a larger market cap than any altcoins right now does not mean that the metric is a good one; it's still bunk, even though it correctly indicates that Bitcoin is more influential than Litecoin.
If I said "the size of a physical coin doesn't indicate how (relatively) valuable it is" and you responded with "but a quarter is bigger than a dime, so maybe that tells us something?" it would be just as valid (or rather, *in*valid) of an argument. Nickels are bigger than pennies, but smaller than dimes. Dimes are smaller than pennies. The "size-to-value" theory is bunk, even if it holds true in the "quarters versus dimes" case.

That's false for a number of reasons. You can move 1000 satoshis with Bitcoin just fine. One example of how to do so is via batching a number of conceptual transactions or payments together into a single network/Bitcoin transaction, and having that be confirmed on-chain (rather than having each individual constituent transaction submitted separately). With signature aggregation techniques like Schnorr, this gets even more powerful and has an even more profound impact on what's possible and viable.
But we can do *better*. We can set up payment channels to get our fees much, much lower.
With regards to the Lightning Network, which is probably the most economically viable decentralized micropayments platform yet conceived, after opening a payment channel, you are able to amortize the fees for doing so over an arbitrary-length chain of transactions, reducing the per-transaction fee to *a few satoshis* or even *less than a satoshi per payment*. The Lightning Network is operational on mainnet *today*, so these sorts of things are a reality (though the software is still being avidly tested and should only be considered in the "early beta" stage right now).
What Vitalik voiced as a criticism of the Lightning Network was the following (which is also wrong):


The reason this is incorrect is because payment channels can be unilaterally funded. Vitalik doesn't seem aware of this fact, which means that what he said here is actually just a misunderstanding on his part.

Day-trading actually does create wealth and value, by reallocating economic resources from incorrect investors and inefficient assets/investment-vehicles to efficient and correct ones.
For anyone interested in learning more, "gains from trade" is a great thing to Google first and foremost. Once you've appreciated the fact that specialization and exchange can allow for greater net productivity, the final ingredient worth considering is trade friction; if these gains from trade are impeded or lessened by an inefficient or imbalanced medium of exchange (e.g. pre-Bitcoin money), that is a net loss for society. Fortunately, because Bitcoin is a superior monetary protocol that is much more fair to participants, it allows us to harness the gains from trade to a greater degree, and brings value to the world (and lots of it). In other words, Bitcoin represents a positive-sum game, and is basically the exact opposite of a Ponzi scheme on a fundamental level.

It seems much more likely that Satoshi was a single person than a group effort. It's not clear exactly why so many people assume that Hal was directly involved *as* Nakamoto (especially since he was openly involved from the earliest days *as* himself).
Hal Finney was a legend and definitely contributed to Bitcoin both philosophically and as an early supporter and user, but bundling him as "part of Satoshi" is a bit silly, given the facts that we know.
The Szabo = Nakamoto theory is pretty darn convincing, though.
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:35:22
What do you mean? You might be confused here. The halving is just Bitcoin's predefined inflation schedule playing out in the real world.
If Bitcoin demand is anywhere even *close* to what it's been through 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 so far, though, the price **has** to rise dramatically, because marginal supply just won't be able to satisfy it any more -- it won't even come close.

Notice that the comment there includes "pretty much said", rather than "said"? Is English not your first language or something?
If I claimed that in [your comment above]( you pretty much said "His comment is legible, and both your accusations against Vitalik being a money grabber and your reference to what Satoshi wrote are both misleading" it does not represent me trying to argue that those were the literal words you wrote (otherwise, I wouldn't use the phrase "pretty much" at all, and would have just copy-and-pasted the comment verbatim). This is a pretty common (and completely valid) way to reference something, especially when trying to paraphrase or summarize longer comments/submissions/essays/etc.
In both cases, my representations of what was said are fair and accurate. I have not used any strawman arguments, I've simply explained the truth while *you* do so.


1) You said (and I quote verbatim): "despite your accusations of vitalik being a money grabber"; I did not do this. This is a strawman argument.
2) You said (and I quote verbatim): "you shouldn't use an assumption of what satoshi said as a literal quote"; I did not do this. This is a strawman argument.
Now that you're accusing me of creating strawman arguments myself, **that is the third strawman argument you've tried**. Just stop.

Smart contracts work on Bitcoin, too. It doesn't have native Turing expressivity like Ethereum does, but there are (many very valid) reasons why structuring the network such that the complex processing is done "at the edges, by the parties who care" rather than "in the middle, redundantly, by everyone" could be considered a superior approach. Furthermore, pretty much any halfway-interesting smart contract follows a pattern of: "depending on external input data, transfer some form of value to a particular destination" which can be done (arguably much more efficiently, securely, and understandably) with Bitcoin and an oracle (likely using multisignature) than with Ethereum and an oracle. As long as you have an oracle, Bitcoin+multisig works just as well as any fancy contract you could build with Ethereum (which, let's remember, *would still inevitably need an oracle* for that data input).


That's not true at all. Vitalik never contributed to Bitcoin Core/QT (and never even tried).
He claims he considered trying to implement Ethereum via OP_RETURN, but decided not to when he saw Luke-Jr passionately arguing that non-monetary use cases of Bitcoin's blockchain should be discouraged. Not only is this very likely post hoc rationalization, but even if we take a leap of faith and take Vitalik at his word, he never "got rejected" at all, and in fact never tried to contribute anything to Bitcoin protocol development; what you are saying now is a total myth.


Again, you're repeating a myth. He never *tried* to add any features to Bitcoin. You can't say he "wasn't allowed" because he never even made an attempt.
Also, he claims he was going to try a Counterparty-esque approach, which does not require a hard fork (Counterparty works fine). The much-more-likely reason he didn't take this route is because there was virtually no demand for Counterparty (and essentially there still isn't), and he probably figured an ICO represented a bigger opportunity to make a splash. Which wasn't wrong, but certainly isn't a noble motive worth admiration or anything.

Ok, well, it sounds like you're not following the saga that closely, which is understandable and puts things in a different light.
But the story has already unfolded, and at this point the matter is satisfactorily settled: Craig Wright is a conman, scam artist, and a pathological liar. He has made about a dozen verifiably-false claims in the past 7 or 8 months, and been caught retroactively editing his own posts to insert false evidence to support these lies, and been caught plagiarizing various sources multiple times...
Now, consider this: the **only** link between Kleiman and Bitcoin/Satoshi is Craig Wright. The entire reason Gizmodo wrote that nonsense article was because of Craig Wright's hints and lies.
No actual evidence exists that links Dave Kleiman to Bitcoin *except* for Craig Wright's claims.

You severely misunderstand; we could easily achieve thousands of transactions per second with almost no routing whatsoever. Once a payment channel is established, linked parties can transact thousands or tens or hundreds of thousands of times before the channel is closed.

The inflation rate dropped by 50% about 10 months ago (this is known as a "reward halvening" and they happen once every four years in Bitcoin). The current price growth is largely attributable to that.
Back in 2012, the very first halvening occurred. The next year (2013) had **two** distinct Bitcoin bubbles, going from $5ish to $260ish early in the year, and then $100ish to $1100ish later in the year. The second halvening happened midway through last year, and history appears to be repeating itself (or at least rhyming) as a result.

It would do no such thing. In fact, it would almost certainly *increase* security dramatically, because the absolute value of the cost-of-attack is actually only one variable in the equation; another (even more relevant) variable would be "likelihood of a single adversary being able to afford said cost" which, right now with the Bitmain de facto monopoly, is depressingly low.
How much would it cost Jihan Wu to 51% attack Bitcoin today? How much would it cost him to 51% attack it if we used SHA-3/keccak instead, and the global community of Bitcoiners responded rationally?
Almost without a doubt, the latter scenario is "more secure" versus an adversarial Jihan Wu.

The most likely reason you are confused about this is that the fee is not explicitly shown to you up front, in most cases (the merchants are simply charging you a higher price on the goods/services you purchase, rather than displaying it as two separate fields of "Price" and "Processing Fee").
This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is so exciting; for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin transactions incur less payment processing fees than credit cards, by a wiiiide margin. Whether this holds true in the long-term remains to be seen.

There is blatant, undeniable empirical evidence that mining pools are not the true arbiters of the miners that participate in them. Despite this, so many people, such as yourself, are incapable of comprehending the distinction between a miner and a mining pool.

What? You were doing relatively well up until here. But then you just stop with "it works out to be quite modest" without justification or logic.
Here, let's *actually* do the math on this.
Any way you slice it, there must be an average of more than $1.5M worth of fresh Bitcoin demand entering the market, *every single day*, to support prices at this level. The past year's worth of bull-market is irrefutable indication that, on average, *more* than this level of demand is entering the market every day, which of course results in the price rising relative to the USD.
Now, when M is cut in half (going from a needed **$1.6M per day** of fresh demand to sustain the price to only **$800k per day** to achieve the same effect), any positive price-pressure that results from a demand surplus is amplified. If we assume marginal demand merely stays *relatively close* to the levels Bitcoin has been seeing for the past 3 years, that's a minimum of $800k per day that needs to be satisfied with market buys (applying upward pressure on the price). 
The only context in which the Bitcoin reward halving does *not* result in a dramatic upwards revaluation, therefore, would be one where demand (for whatever reason) significantly decreased around the same time as the halving occurs. If you want to argue that there will be a significant reduction in daily demand for Bitcoin in the next year or so, then it's reasonable to also posit that the halving doesn't result in a severe price increase.
And don't forget, this is all *before* we take into account any positive feedback loops and/or self-fulfilling prophecies that result from the aforementioned phenomena. Without a doubt, though, as miners (and other market participants) experience positive price pressure, they become more and more willing to hold the asset for longer intervals and enter more "market long" positions or withhold from shorting. Humans are greedy. All effects mentioned above therefore compound by nature.

In the field of applied cryptography, "electronic cash" actually refers to a digital money with particular properties; an early example being [Chaumian ecash]( Bitcoin was created to be (and very much still is, and likely always will be) this sort of electronic cash. This doesn't imply anything about the eventual transaction fee rates that the open-market blockchain competition equilibrates upon, though. In other words, electronic cash with 10% transaction fees is still electronic cash.
Bitcoin is also analogous to digital gold (and always has been, and likely always will be). From the whitepaper:


Satoshi regularly [likened Bitcoin to gold](
 and [gold mining]( in fact. It is both digital gold and digital cash, and was designed (from the very beginning) to be so. The two are not mutually exclusive, and Bitcoin is fulfilling both roles admirably.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:35:00
It's not a stupid question at all.
SegWit is a clever trick that was developed which achieves a number of benefits, but the two most interesting ones are this:
1) By allowing signature data to be treated separately from other transaction data in Bitcoin, it allows more transactions to fit in each Bitcoin block. This basically means that more people will be able to use Bitcoin (and that average fees-per-transaction should drop). It is a "capacity increase", and one awesome thing about it is that it doesn't require a "hard fork" which basically just means "an upgrade that a supermajority of nodes and miners must agree on, because with significant disagreement a network split could occur where a lot of people could potentially lose money". Hard forks are generally seen as more risky than soft forks (and SegWit is currently being implemented as a soft fork).
2) SegWit actually solves another known issue in Bitcoin called "transaction malleability", which is a little technical quirk in the protocol which is rather annoying. The great thing about this is that transaction malleability was preventing much much cooler technology (like the Lightning Network) from being viable. Lightning Network is basically a layer on top of Bitcoin that would allow thousands of times more transactions to take place through "payment channels" without needing all these transactions to take up block space. A working Lightning Network would be the Holy Grail of scaling, and would basically mean that Bitcoin transactions can be instant and virtually free, and that Bitcoin can support billions of people using it for everyday commerce.
So, basically, SegWit is seen as a relatively safe upgrade that lays the foundation for serious scaling and other improvements.

There's an equilibrium mechanism in place. It doesn't matter, because it's predetermined explicitly and even if some miners drop out because they're not profitable any more, difficulty will adjust accordingly.

The rest of your comment depends on this being true, and it isn't.
I can think of a few different ways to compete with them. If the model works, what prohibits other mining operations from replicating it?
Answer: nothing.
If some company in China starts doing *the same exact thing as 21* then they reap the exact same "$0 electricity cost" benefits. So why shouldn't such a copycat operation arise?

On average, every ten minutes, one Bitcoin block is created by a lucky Bitcoin miner out there. If you sent a Bitcoin transaction, and it is one of the transactions included in a block, that counts as one *confirmation* of your transaction (because it's now been "confirmed" as part of The Blockchain).
But let's pretend another lucky miner managed to create an *alternative* Bitcoin block, which did *not* include your transaction in it, at the same height in The Blockchain as the block with your transaction in it. If miners kept mining on top of *this* block instead (adding more blocks onto the branch of The Blockchain without your transaction in it) then your transaction ends up not actually being sent... so it wasn't really truly confirmed to be part of the chain, in the end. 
But if miners keep mining blocks that reference the block that *does* have your transaction in it, each additional block adds one confirmation to your payment. It becomes exponentially more expensive to "un-confirm" your transaction with each new block built on top of the one that it's in, because in order to reverse that payment, miners would have to mine not only an alternative block without your transaction in it, but more blocks on top of that one, too. 
The [original Bitcoin whitepaper]( laid out the math for all of this. In a nutshell, if your transaction gets 6 or more confirmations (meaning it is included in a block and then 5 more blocks are built on top of that one) then it is *extremely* unlikely to ever be reversed or un-done.
10 confirmations generally means that your transaction is "as good as gold" and officially part of The Blockchain for all time. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:58:46


Firstly, SegWit increases the max blocksize to 4MB.
Secondly, if we just hard-forked the MAX_BLOCKSIZE constant from 1000000 to 2000000, it's possible to create and include transactions that take &gt;10 minutes to verify (quadratic sigops attack). This, alone, shows just how bad of an idea merely changing that constant would be.
But you don't understand this, of course, or else you wouldn't say "There is no argument I've seen against 2MB blocks that holds water". So what we have here is a case of one side understanding the issue, and the other not. It's unsurprising, then, that you don't agree with the experts who understand what they're talking about; you simply aren't informed enough to comprehend their arguments and reasoning. But your own ignorance is something only you have the power to remedy.

The original claim was that "you can't move 1000 satoshis on Bitcoin, it's impossible, fees would exceed it anyway"... this was incorrect. The new claim (that isolated dust outputs aren't very spendable right now) is much more defensible, but also much less of a serious issue. And for the record, the minrelayfee exists in BCH, too (and is the same value, in fact) so the exact same problem exists with knockoff Bitcoin-airdrop altcoins (the only difference being that their "satoshis" are worth less than one tenth of ours, and this figure is pretty steadily dwindling).


The Lightning Network is a layer above the base (blockchain) layer and is relatively young right now, so it will probably be a while before bitcoin.org starts listing Lightning wallets/software.
If you are looking for a wallet with "official" mainnet support and a user-friendly GUI, Eclair might be the only one right now (which is a phone app). Zap has a slick interface but I don't think they have officially released a mainnet release yet. Lightning Labs' lnd has full mainnet support but requires command-line interaction at the moment.
The TL;DR is that you should be Googling "Lightning Network wallet" rather than starting from a general Bitcoin portal.

This is a fellow who is shockingly gullible and impressionable, and he found himself in a social position where the level-headed engineers started taking him less and less seriously, while his nastiest behavior got continually cheered on by a weird (and perhaps paid) splinter group of subversives trying to "wrest control of Bitcoin" from the developers in the space (who, incidentally, aren't even smart enough to realize that this doesn't make sense to begin with).

In what way? Don't handwave, answer explicitly. Just saying "it's better!" is not a real answer.


Uh, neither would a private blockchain. The immutability is a property of the decentralization, not some magical property automatically bestowed on a system just because it involves the word "blockchain" in its name.


This is amusing, because none of this is beneficial, and most actually represent drawbacks to the blockchain model. Blockchains "waste" processing power that would not be necessary to use in a shared database model, and incur redundant storage costs that would be avoided with a nice centralized storage solution.
The entire last paragraph is more handwaving. "It'd be better because it's better," basically. 
So far, you have explained exactly zero reasons why a proprietary blockchain would be a superior solution to a shared database alternative, but somehow managed to step on your own toes in the comment and accidentally highlight *drawbacks* to your approach.

Bitcoin has never had any scalability problems. The network is designed to grow as it needs to, and I see no evidence of it encountering any bottleneck issues so far.

You only need to anchor the proofs in the Blockchain for those benefits, though. Having your contracts redundantly computed doesn't confer any advantages over at-the-edge computation by parties to which the contracts are relevant. Otherwise the system bears enormous costs to all participants, without any incentives for those participants to bear those costs. It makes no sense.
The problem with Ethereum is *much* deeper than just their central dictators' ability to hard-fork away any illusory immutability and contracts that they didn't like the results of. The actual network design makes no sense and doesn't have incentives balanced even rudimentarily, and that's well before we start talking about the social problems and poor implementation details.

Ripple is doing a great job demonstrating just how meaningful the "market cap" metric is when the coin is significantly premined and centralized.

Why are you evaluating based on expenditures? Bitcoin is in an early "accumulate coins" phase rather than a later "spend" phase right now.
Furthermore, the coin has sustained its longest bear market period in its entire history over the past 2 years, so expenditures will naturally be lower these days. You should Google the "wealth effect" if you have some time to kill.
In short, LocalBitcoins data reflects the state of adoption. Those other metrics reflect the state of expenditures, which is irrelevant to this thread.

It really sounds like you're having trouble grasping the basics here. I can't tell if there's a language barrier or if you just have a hard time communicating via typing, but your every sentence is a veritable puzzle, and beyond that, it seems like you have more than a couple concepts completely backwards in your mental schema. The general user story for Lightning Network would be funding a public channel once, transacting through that channel for every transaction in which Lightning is economically viable to route through (in the preliminary tests of Flare and Eclair, on an *alpha implementation* it was an 80% routing success rate *in under a half a second*, which is to say that the initial results are **incredibly** promising), and then closing out this channel every so often to start a new one (perhaps once per month). Even if we're being pessimistic and assuming we can do no better than that initial 80% figure in terms of routing success and never ever optimize at all, that means we've *still* multiplied our transaction throughput capacity by **5** with widespread Lightning use. 


Oh, 1000 TPS with Lightning Network is *definitely* feasible. Network-wide, Lightning should theoretically be able to perform many orders of magnitude greater transactions/second than Visa. We've crunched the numbers. They look good.


Not aware of anyone dismissing it outright. But we have working systems now, and it's a matter of tying them together neatly and vetting them. It's not like routing is trivial, but it's also *certainly* not going to prevent Lightning Network from having a huge positive impact, as in *multiple orders of magnitude*, on Bitcoin's capacity.

Sure thing. Lightning Network is actually simpler to understand than SegWit, in my opinion.
Lightning Network is a network of "channels", which are basically just shared Bitcoin accounts. You and I can open up a channel between us by sending our coins to a shared multisignature address, which we can both withdraw our respective balances from at any time (back to a normal Bitcoin address that we have full control of). 
Once we have this channel open, we can make transactions to each other without actually publishing anything to The Blockchain. This means that on our transactions to one another, we don't have to wait for any block confirmations, we don't have to worry about the fees that on-chain transactions might require for quicker confirmation, and we don't have to worry about "dust limits" (meaning we can send tiny, tiny amounts to each other without any issues). We can basically get the same sort of cryptographic security that we would get with Bitcoin, but we don't have to worry about actual blockchain confirmations until there was a dispute between us, and one of us decides to "close out" the channel and redeem the last-agreed-upon balance.
The easiest way to understand how this works is with an example, I think. 
1) You and I both send 1 BTC into a shared channel. 
2) I buy a bunch of widgets from you, and give you a signature allowing you to withdraw 1.5 BTC (so that I can only withdraw 0.5 BTC now). Basically, I pay you 0.5 BTC.
3) You don't actually push this signature/transaction to The Blockchain. You set it aside for whenever you're ready to close the channel between us.
4) Later, you buy some doodads from me for 0.1 BTC. Just like in step 2, you give me a signature that allows me to withdraw 0.6 BTC from the channel, which would leave you with 1.4 BTC that you could withdraw. 
5) Again, I don't push this transaction to The Blockchain, I just hold on to it.
6) Later on, you insult my wife, and I decide I'm never going to do business with you again. I decide to close out the channel, by publishing the last transaction you sent me (which gives me 0.6 BTC) to The Blockchain. You get the 1.4 BTC left over, of course, because that was the last agreed-upon balance between us, and no matter how much I hate your guts I can't prevent you from receiving those funds that are rightfully yours.
The important note is that at *every step along the way, either one of us could close the channel out, and redeem our standing balance*.
We could theoretically make millions of transactions to one another over our channel, and when all is said and done this only result in a couple of on-chain transactions. If these sorts of channels are being used frequently, billions and billions of Bitcoin transactions could be taking place all over the world without completely bloating The Blockchain.

No, I mean exactly what I said, and SegWit **is** an increase in the max blocksize to 4MB. You can go look at the blocks I linked to. That is indisputable proof of the claim. 
The source of your misunderstanding is that SegWit *allows* blocks up to 4MB (hence why it is a max blocksize increase to 4MB), but most blocks are not expected to be that large, even with full SegWit usage. With full SegWit usage, and assuming most transactions are similar in profile to those we see on the network today, we should see blocks reaching sizes of 1.6MB to 2MB on the network. They could, of course, be larger (and will be, if people make many signature-intensive transactions in a given block), but on average blocks will likely not be larger than 2-3MB in practice, even with full SegWit adoption.
SegWit increases the max blocksize to 4MB, period. It does not mean that suddenly there will be a bunch of 4MB blocks on the network.
Like I said, only you can cure your own ignorance. Take this as an opportunity to learn; I clearly have a much deeper understanding of the subject than you, and I am willing to patiently explain things to you if you politely ask.

I hope you're not offended by this response, but you are severely confused. Double spending is trivially prevented in a centralized-ledger paradigm; the ledger-keeper simply doesn't allow it to occur. It is only a problem if you want the ledger to be decentralized (i.e. there is no central authority overseeing entries).
Decentralization isn't the "solution" to double-spending, it is the reason why it is a problem in the first place. Proof of Work and game theory form the solution.

No, it's not. But you can tell yourself whatever you want, if it helps you sleep at night by justifying your favorite shitcoin (which is, by the way, **absolutely plummeting in value** recently).


"Fixing" it? There's nothing broken to "fix", so what are you on about?


Great rebuttal, captain. Oh wait, no. It's not. You can say "nonsense" to anything, but that doesn't make it actual nonsense. Maybe you want to make another attempt here?


An "artificially limited good"? What's "artificial" about digital scarcity? There's nothing artificial about it, or if you *really* want to call it "artificial" then your shitcoin is an "artificially unlimited good" in that case. Woohoo.


Uh, no, it's not? Nothing in the definition of "money" implies that inflation is an advantageous attribute. Nice try, lol.


"Will tend to converge on the inflation" -- this is the literary equivalent of a toddler trying on his dad's suit. You combined words, but they didn't actually come out as a coherent sentence. You were kinda sorta close, but no cigar, kiddo.
Regardless of your failure to properly express yourself in this case, it's pretty obvious what you were *trying* to say, so I'll take a moment to address that.
Why is deflation undesirable, when you are technically capable of dividing your monetary tokens to smaller and smaller units? 
Good luck answering the above question. Hahahahaha.


There's nothing about it that seems advantageous. It's like if I said "the coin works on Mars"; the statement itself is easily interpretable, but the relevance to our discussion is incredibly tenuous. What's vague is why you mentioned this at all.


The beautiful, glorious irony! Your entire comment has been " Wrong", "Nonsense", "Nuh-uh" dismissals with no actual basis or supportive reasoning. Your stating it as such doesn't really mean anything, my friend.


Ok, so what's the **advantage** of doing so over a deterministic wallet? Oh, were you hastily interpreting the statement as "11 and 10 are identical in every respect" rather than the more intelligent interpretation of "there is no advantage to 11 that isn't already conferred by 10"? Looks like you were. Oopsie daises, should have taken a moment to think things through!


Look, I know you want to justify your shitcoin by any means necessary, and when someone like me comes along and very rapidly identifies the shitcoin as bullshit, you naturally want to lash out and dismiss the points I've raised. You want to rationalize your bad decisions by any means necessary, so you frantically tell yourself "Oh he simply must not *understand* why my shitcoin is the best! That must be it!"
Little wonder that you would do this, too! Your precious shitcoin is absolutely **tanking** in value (sorry, bud, but the shitcoin business is rough), so you're probably down *a lot* of money recently, and you're emotionally on edge as a result. Typically this would be a good time to take a step back and reassess your stance, but hey, getting all hot and bothered on Reddit is another way to handle the rage and frustration you have pent up inside you as a result of your financial losses.

@_date: 2016-05-25 02:20:41


Fun fact: it doesn't even matter! 
Demand is demand, and supply is supply. It really doesn't matter if the newly mined coins are sold on exchanges, sold over the counter, sold on LocalBitcoins, or held by the miners who mined them. They wind up in the pockets of those who demand them.
If marginal demand remains constant while marginal supply drops significantly, that's all you need to know. Price **must** go up in that scenario.
Mind you, this is *if* demand remains constant. There's no way around the conclusion, provided the premises (demand stays constant or close to it, supply inflation is cut in half) hold true.

SegWit increases the maximum blocksize by replacing it with a larger limit (the blockweight limit). Old nodes are, by definition, incapable of increasing their blocksize limit (as soon as they do, they're not "old nodes" any more), regardless of what changes or upgrades new nodes implement.
Many people are confused into believing that this means SegWit therefore cannot represent an increase in the maximum blocksize, because it retains backwards compatibility with old nodes. It's pretty clever how it does...
Basically, if your node asks "Hey, please give me block  then my node will respond "Alright, are you upgraded to support SegWit?"
If your node says "yes" then my node will send yours the whole block, which is 2.5MB in size, and includes all the signatures (witness data) for the transactions.
If your node instead says "no" then my node will take block  and strip out all the witness data from it. In this example, the witness data is 1.6MB in size, so once it has been removed, all that is left is a 0.9MB block (which I send to you).
As you can see, your node didn't get the full block (all 2.5MB) because it's not upgraded and couldn't handle the specially-formatted witness data. That doesn't mean that the witness data isn't part of the block -- it is! I just don't send it to your node when you ask for the block, because you wouldn't understand it. In effect, your node is basically running with the setting to prune witness data enabled by default.
This is how SegWit increases the blocksize while maintaining backwards-compatibility.
It is a blocksize increase, which has the witness data formatted in a way that makes it cleanly strippable. This nice, efficient format **in no way** makes SegWit "not a blocksize increase", it just provides a means of backwards compatibility that other blocksize increases wouldn't be able to provide.

You send collateral (usually bitcoins) to an exchange that provides shorting (margin trading). You place a margin short on Bitcoin. If the price rises too much, the exchange keeps your coins, and your balance is now 0 even though you made a nonzero deposit there. If the price falls instead, you can close your short in profit, and your balance will be larger than what you deposited after you do.

Yes, true. That's a caveat worth mentioning.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:14:09
Yeah, agreed. The only problem is that we can't actually assume that any more, in the face of empirical evidence to the contrary.
GHash.io wouldn't start charging negligible pool fees even as they approached (and briefly exceeded) 51% total hashrate, in the face of a *very* vocal and disapproving community. It was irrational, and ultimately they wound up losing market share in a massive way... but they illustrated the principle that "mining pools can behave against the best interests of Bitcoin" rather well.
More recently (and relevantly), Bitmain and all its subsidiaries (i.e. basically every pool supporting BU) appear to be incentivized by their covert ASICBOOST competitive advantage, and are therefore actively opposing upgrades to the system (which, again, are being loudly demanded) and stonewalling all scaling progress. This is obviously bad for Bitcoin at large, but Bitmain et al are still doing so, for the sake of individual localized profits.
Bitcoin can't survive off of "hoping against the adversarial case", so it's our job as community members to continue protecting our interests as best we can. Right now, supporting SegWit and opposing BU is about as much as you can do, as a non-mining user, to help Bitcoin (besides buying and holding, of course). So we all have our role to play.

We have the solution coded up and ready (it's called "SegWit"), but unfortunately one big mining monopoly (Bitmain) has found an "exploit" that makes them millions and millions of dollars per year, and the upgrade that will reduce fees interferes with this exploit. They are therefore doing everything they can to prevent the upgrade from activating. There are solutions in terms of activating the upgrade anyway, but the community is still busy determining the safest and most effective way to do so.
Right now, Bitcoin is not as useful for small purchases that can be done just as well with your credit card. It will likely take a couple years before it starts to outperform credit cards in small-value transactions that don't stand a high chance of being censored. For now, the main value and utility Bitcoin provides is as an investment, a portfolio hedge, a digital asset that (when properly secured) is not able to be confiscated from you, or as a protocol for transactions that aren't possible elsewhere (like buying illegal goods online, remitting money across borders, and circumventing capital controls).
After SegWit activates, though, Bitcoin will gain the capability to handle hundreds or thousands of times as many transactions (for far, far lower fees per transaction) as layer-two solutions become possible.

Bitcoin adoption proceeds as healthily as possible, with demand gradually trickling in so that price grows from $x to $y. It doesn't matter what x and y are, just that they are sufficiently different values. Let's say $300 to $700 for now.
Now, what happens as a result of this gradual growth? Increased confidence amongst the existing pool of users, increased utility for all network participants (after all, more liquidity means more stability and more utility),  increased appeal to any potential investors who are waiting on the sidelines but currently unconvinced... and finally, increased attention. News articles inevitably get published acknowledging the growth and returns. "Bitcoin continues year-long bull market", "Bitcoin - the new gold?", "DOW down, Bitcoin up", etc etc etc. In a nutshell, the media observes the growth.
And what does that cause? *More* interest, *more* market confidence, *more* news coverage. It's a feedback loop. There's no conceivable way for the feedback loop *not* to manifest, assuming that the gradual growth persists. 
The newcomers, who have only ever experienced a bull market, are able to flaunt their wealth and brag to their friends and family. They want their loved ones to prosper, too, so they help them get set up on Coinbase or whatever. Growth accelerates and compounds.
Now the price starts climbing a little more quickly, a little more noticeably. The news articles get more and more sensational and prolific, and... well, you get the idea. The speculative frenzy begins in earnest. The market gets overexuberant. In short, greed takes over.
And once again, as it has many times before and most likely will do many times again, Bitcoin bubbles.
For as long as Man is greedy and Bitcoin has a relatively small "market cap", it won't be able to grow gradually for extended periods of time. It is not possible for the hivemind to keep its greed in check; history screams this simple fact over and over at us. Logic backs it up.
In the future, *if* Bitcoin is able to achieve a reasonably-large global presence and the liquidity pool is sufficiently enlarged, the volatility can be softened and tempered (and logically this is what should take place, assuming adoption continues). But if you want to go from $200 to $1000 in gradual $1-a-day steps, I'm sorry, but you're hoping for the impossible. 
I would *love* for that particular impossibility to manifest, somehow. But I understand the market enough not to kid myself.

I see that "censorship resistance" and "trustlessness" are (validly) considered potential drivers of demand; what are your thoughts on "predictable supply" (i.e. "inflation resistance") as another example of such a driver? It doesn't seem to fit cleanly under either other umbrella, in my opinion.

The CONOP should be minimized if at all possible. It's okay if some people cannot afford to run a node. It's not okay if *no one* can.

No, I didn't. Read what I *did* write. Hint: it includes a clause about demand.
**If** marginal demand stays constant and marginal supply drops, price **must** rise. This is not the same as saying "price must increase dramatically after the halving" and you should be embarrassed for typing up so many words and wasting both of our time.

First, because "Emergent Consensus" is a terrible proposal, for many reasons.

@_date: 2017-05-19 14:35:26
Again, though, the value proposition of Bitcoin is that, as a protocol, it minimizes the level of trust required to transact. If you reintroduce trust into the equation (which not running a node yourself necessarily does), it levels the playing field, and the core advantage Bitcoin has over other monies is gone. It's okay for individual users of the coins to choose not to run nodes, certainly, but if it's *totally impossible* for you or I to feasibly run a fully-validating node, that has profound implications for the Bitcoin network, as a whole. Arguably, some might reasonably regard that as a "catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin experiment" in a big sense.
It's a very interesting and complex subject, that's for sure.
@_date: 2015-03-11 03:26:35
None of this requires a blockchain. You're just talking about an encrypted database.
You don't appear to understand what a blockchain achieves. All a blockchain achieves is decentralized consensus. 
No, it doesn't speed things up. Network bandwidth is where speed comes in. No, it doesn't secure things. That's just plain old encryption. A blockchain actually sacrifices speed and increases storage costs, but in exchange, it grants decentralization.
This is not "the bitcoin blockchain" I'm referring to. This is the technology of blockchains in general.
You, and so many like you, still do not appear to understand this technology.

If you generate and then erase a private key, it's the same as you not generating it at all.

Great questions, I'll do my best to answer them to the best of my ability.


Sort of. Coins in a Lightning Network channel have to be in "hot storage" rather than "cold storage" by the very nature of channels, and to receive a LN transaction you would have to actually get the signed script in some way. Just like you can't be sure of your Bitcoin balance without being connected to the network, you can't know if you received a LN transaction without being connected to the network. Once you have ahold of the authorizing script/signature, you can be confident that the funds assigned to you are under your control and that you can close out the channel with them at any time. And finally, for a Lightning Network *node* to route payments, it would, naturally, also have to be connected to the network/Internet. Again, this is exactly like nodes in Bitcoin.
This could be interpreted as a "problem" but I don't know if I'd go so far as to say it's a "major problem". Definitely something to keep in mind!


I am not 100% sure about this, since I haven't been able to review/play with an actual LN implementation yet, but I *believe* that it would still require me to manually withdraw my coins from the channel. Of course, I'd be able to withdraw at my leisure, so there would be no rush, because the only signature needed to transfer those coins is my own.


No, you would be free to withdraw to any address of your choosing. A channel-closing transaction is just like any other Bitcoin transaction, and can be directed wherever you want it to go.


Tough to say. If it provides more benefits to them than drawbacks, I would certainly expect them to.


The transactions in LN are basically just cryptographic signatures entitling the channel-users to redeem their funds whenever they feel like it. If you (or your software) is careful about signature validation, Lightning Network transactions are pretty final and can be treated as "as good as gold", because all it takes is one Bitcoin transaction broadcast to get things confirmed on-chain. An exchange could accept LN transactions and update their internal account balances accordingly, just like they do with other Bitcoin transactions (except without needing to wait for confirmation).


It won't be part of Bitcoin Core, it's a separate project entirely (and it wouldn't make logistical sense to bundle their code together). But it would make sense for wallet providers to bundle in LN compatibility into *their* code, because a wallet with LN features available would be more useful/powerful than one without.

Very nicely summarized.

@_date: 2016-05-24 11:55:30
Complain to the merchant, not to the network.
Bitcoin is all open source; if you don't understand payments and confirmations, that's on you. It's orders of magnitude faster than other remote payment options (like credit cards and wire transfers), so it actually **is** far closer to "instant" than any real alternatives. 
You're simply complaining about the merchant or payment processor's policy. isn't the place for this.

There are no "majority requirements" in BU code. None at all. Each miner advertises what size blocks they will tolerate, and are free to mine whatever size blocks they want (at any time, with or without the support of the majority). The idea is that if the majority isn't on board, the block is rejected, and let's just ignore the costs of reorganizations and orphaned chains because who cares about the fact that Bitcoin was designed specifically around minimizing such costs?
I'm not even kidding. You can't make this stuff up.

Another great question, and fortunately the answer is yes.
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:26:26
Which one? The big one in April or the smaller one in November?
Actually, it doesn't really matter. The answer is the same: Bitcoin is the best money mankind has ever seen. It received more exposure, so more people became aware of it, which, in turn, meant that more people bought it (having seen its superiority), so price rose.
Didn't hurt that the first halvening occurred in late 2012, so marginal supply wasn't sufficient to handle incoming demand (**hint, hint**).
And with the November run-up, China had finally decided to check Bitcoin out. This was basically the second major nation to seriously start participating in Bitcoin, so of course the marginal demand that represents will have a dramatic effect on price.
Don't listen to the parrots who caw on and on about Willybot. A few minutes of critical thought pretty much eliminates that as a realistic rationale, but that doesn't stop the Buttcoiners from desperately trying to harp it as such.

Nothing has been dragging. The max blocksize is not important (but incidentally, it is being increased to 4MB with SegWit, which is being released this week and could activate in the next 2 months). What is important is capacity. And naively increasing the blocksize is, by far, the worst and riskiest way to achieve greater capacity.
A bunch of anti-Bitcoiners have formed a different subreddit where they socially attack Bitcoin every single day, obsessing over the blocksize and trying to fracture the network despite pretty much every single engineer who understands the system telling them exactly why every terrible idea they propose is awful.

It's not a theory; I've merely presented the facts of the matter.
Furthermore, the expectation that "Bitcoin should have already taken over credit cards" is remarkably naive. Even if Bitcoin were inarguably better in every way, that doesn't necessarily mean that it would displace credit cards within a year or two, *at all*. To expect this would be particularly silly, because there are switching costs when it comes to currencies, and the USD (and other national fiat currencies) have existing networks that are much, much larger than the fledgling network Bitcoin is in the process of bootstrapping. You should read into the network effect; it's fascinating stuff. But the TL;DR is that, no, the superiority of Bitcoin over credit cards in particular respects is by no means a guarantee of a successful coup d'etat overnight.
I'm starting to get the impression that you're not actually trying to have a real conversation here, though, and that you'd instead prefer to push a particular narrative or bias, regardless of how true or false it may be. I'm hoping that I'm wrong, though.
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:35:51
It's abundantly clear you're not an expert, don't worry.
I *have* done my research, and a great deal of critical thinking, and I've reached conclusions based upon these things. Furthermore, in dozens of discussions similar to this one, I have *never* had someone provide a reasonable answer to the question: "What benefits would a private blockchain provide over a properly-set-up shared database?"
Never. Once.
Know why? There isn't a valid answer to the question. One simply does not exist.
@_date: 2015-10-21 14:37:16
Yes, but it would almost certainly take billions of years before anyone generated an address that you had saved away, even if you were generating billions per second.

@_date: 2017-05-19 01:40:22
Sorry, I assumed the worst, because the whole "put words in someone else's mouth" thing has happened to me far too many times in these subreddits.
To be clear, I don't believe that changing the Proof of Work algorithm is "perfectly fine" or particularly "safe", though I do consider it to be a possible upgrade path that Bitcoin could conceivably take. 
I simply wanted to point out that it wouldn't necessarily be a nightmare scenario when looked at in terms of network security, in particular because of a currently suboptimal Bitmain pseudo-monopoly that seems to be (at least temporarily) adversely affecting Bitcoin. 
I certainly don't think we have a good enough reason to change the PoW function right now. It's a nice option to have as a fallback, though.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:42:12
The only thing you proved is that if you are willing to redefine enough words, you can pretend any statement is any other statement.
If I recall correctly, the last time we had a conversation about this, the original Bitcoin whitepaper was "proven" (with your ridiculous redefinition method) to be a description of an extraterrestrial invasion of Earth, much to my amusement and your embarrassment.
@_date: 2015-10-11 19:53:16
Your entire argument is "I assure you, this is the case." You don't have any supportive statements or points, you just "assure me" that Bitcoin is in a "everyone should be spending bitcoin rather than accumulating it" phase, when it's clearly not the case.
At this time, the marginal utility of using Bitcoin for consumer payments over credit cards is far less than the marginal utility of using Bitcoin for wealth storage versus infinitely-inflating governmental fiat currency alternatives.
The reality is that most Bitcoiners get into Bitcoin for the value proposition it represents as an investment, not for the value proposition it represents (at this point in time) when making retail payments. Of course, as the ecosystem evolves and matures, naturally other facets to Bitcoin (like its viability for handling consumer payments) will develop and improve, but right now, no one is saying "You know what? I'll buy some Bitcoin so I can go shopping on Amazon!" 
And lest we forget, again I want to repeat that it is absolutely irrelevant to bring up Bitpay performance figures when we're talking about global Bitcoin adoption. We're talking about LocalBitcoins charts here, not Bitpay. There are plenty of threads about Bitpay specifically if you want to go talk about it where it's relevant, but when we're discussing global adoption (and how impressively it's taking off, as evidenced by the LBC charts from the OP), let's try to stay on topic, okay?

It's definitely possible. As the market grows and matures, it will likely build inertia (and gradually start to resemble more traditional markets, which go through years or even decades-long market cycles).
The counterargument that I can see is "Mt. Gox imploding really contributed to an especially-long bear market, so perhaps this one won't last as long." This makes sense, too, and it's really hard to guess which makes *more* sense.
I think that generally speaking, "bubbles slowing down over time" is something we should definitely plan around.

No, history can be trivially altered unless there is a cost of doing so. Which is why Proof of Work is used.

Your comment is almost **entirely** devoid of truth. 
There are a *lot* more than 2 parameters.
BitUSD absolutely involves counterparty risk. 
Furthermore, BitUSD is a token that is *supposed* to be equivalent in value to a real dollar. This actually means that it is worth **less than a dollar** because it is factually inferior in a number of ways to a real dollar:
1) It can't be used to pay taxes.
2) It is not legal tender.
3) It is susceptible to bugs or flaws in the protocol, whether they are known or not. There is no "lender of last resort" to guarantee the peg.
4) It is not insured, nor insurable.
5) It is not accepted where dollars are accepted (it has a tiny network). It is arguably not really accepted **anywhere at all**.
For these reasons, the price of a BitUSD would require a premium relative to actual dollars, to be a competitive asset. Notice that no such premium exists, rendering it a decisively inferior asset. 
Read up on Proof of Stake and its limitations before trying to respond, please.

No need to apologize, it's a good question.
No, Gavin hasn't really backed this up with anything more than a tweet or two. The group that like to identify as the "big blocks crowd" have started to argue more and more frequently that nodes aren't important in Bitcoin, and that we shouldn't prioritize users being able to afford the cost of running one.
This is most likely in response to the fact that node support for "alternative clients" (like XT, Classic, BU, etc) is abysmally low (and fairly transparently faked), the fact that XThin software is now notorious for its negative impact on node stability, and the reality that significantly larger blocks would rapidly make Bitcoin nodes cost prohibitive to run... all of which are pretty difficult to reconcile with the perspective that nodes are important in Bitcoin.
I personally think this is a very foolish set of beliefs to hold, and is mainly borne of desperation and ignorance. I think the cost of node operation (the [CONOP]( should be kept to a minimum for the sake of preserving Bitcoin's value proposition.

Entirely possible with a database! Also more economical/cheap with a database.


Either the network involves mining or it doesn't. Later you talk about *not* using PoW, here you're assuming you *do* use PoW. Still stepping on your own toes, I see.


You're really starting to go off the deep end here. Nothing you've described is "free" at all. It's being paid for by the nodes who make up the network. The more private the network, the higher cost per node. No such thing as a free lunch, dontchaknow.


Yeah, and you can enable logging on a shared database. Still waiting for a **benefit** over a database. Still conspicuously missing from your replies...
It is starting to seem like you have fundamental misunderstandings in many different areas, but you might be best served by researching databases. You seem to think they're incapable of things that they're entirely capable of. Things they've been capable of for decades.


I have to assume you're referring to Proof of Stake here, unless you've secretly invented a revolutionary new system and haven't unveiled it yet. Proof of Stake is fundamentally vulnerable to reorgs, what with the whole Nothing-at-Stake issue and all. Gregory Maxwell has done a great job of illustrating this, if you want to hit up the old Google machine.


And after all is said and done, you have **still provided absolutely ZERO reasons why a private blockchain is a superior solution to a shared database**!

This metric is **highly** misleading. If you are putting much stock into it, you're setting yourself up to be confused and disappointed down the line.
Market cap is an *incredibly* gameable metric, and the "fair launch" coins (like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero) are *massively* underrepresented if you naively gauge things via "market cap" like so many newbies do. Meanwhile, *because* so many people take it seriously, new coins and tokens are constantly finding ways to puff their market cap figures up, which isn't hard at all to do, but makes the metric completely meaningless for the purposes of comparing cryptocurrency sizes/influences.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:43:18
What is proven is that as fees supplant the block reward as mining incentive, the demand for block space must exceed the supply thereof, otherwise the assumptions of the incentive scheme don't hold.
I can respect the perspective that our priority should be focused on expanding the demand, rather than restricting supply, especially in the near- to mid-term. However, it's also important to remember that tradeoffs are inevitable for any evolution of the initial protocol. We just have to evaluate proposals on their merit, to the best of our respective abilities.

VISA takes *months* for payments to settle. Bitcoin takes *minutes*.
It's like you're not even bothering to compare apples to oranges, and are instead comparing apple seeds to orange trees.


Right, and here is why my analogy is so apt. The USPS already had its infrastructure. Everyone already had mailing addresses, and email was not convenient because relatively few friends and family used the technology. To send and receive emails you needed to buy a computer, a bad dial-up Internet connection, and type your letters up on that infernal machine before being able to use SMTP. Seriously who wants to do that? Furthermore if you're not at your desk, you can't send emails at all : yay!

Not only is having pending transactions not something to worry about, it is actually *necessary* to have a permanent backlog of transactions awaiting confirmation, for Bitcoin to survive in the long term (meaning longer than a decade or so).

At this point I couldn't tell if you were serious or trolling. Bitcoin is a protocol; would you say "email requires just as many employees as the USPS"? 
Companies *in* Bitcoin require employees. Bitcoin does not.


This is not an indelible property of Bitcoin; it is a consequence of its youth. I have a hard time taking arguments seriously when they focus so much on where the ball is, and not at all on where it's heading.

Consumption will be no more discouraged, in aggregate, than it is right now. Whether or not the money of the world is deflationary, people will still compete to accrue wealth. Just because postponing expenditure results in a net increase of wealth (which, in fact, it does even in an inflationary regime, as long as investment instruments are available at all) does not mean that suddenly greed will stop serving its purpose. People will always want more, and *that* is what drives production.
I don't need to build a car factory today, no. No one does, in fact. But the fact that dollars are inflating has no bearing on that fact whatsoever. The reason that all those car factories got built is not inflation, it's that some people wanted more money than they currently had, and they decided that car factories were a good way to get it.

Almost all altcoins are pump-and-dump schemes. Sure, some actually do attempt some interesting experimental innovation, but these are few, far between, and not readily-identifiable even by extremely informed agents in the space. As such, the altcoin space is riddled with horror stories and arguably hurts the public image of cryptocurrency significantly. 
Altcoins dilute the scarcity of Bitcoin, to a degree. Of course they don't really threaten it in a major way, but one of the fundamental strengths of Bitcoin is its immutable scarcity. Attempts to "equalize" altcoins are simultaneously attempts to undermine this scarcity, whether or not this is deliberate. It is therefore  rational behavior for someone invested in Bitcoin to discourage such developments. You're watching the network effect in action.
Even though they're all basically clones using the same basic formula, and support for altcoins should be relatively trivial to implement, all extra work costs capital. Time and money spent debugging Litecoin and Dogecoin issues is necessarily not spent improving other aspects of the platform or service. It is a waste of capital from the perspective of the Bitcoin community (take a look at the subreddit you're in).
There is a memetic misconception that "Bitcoin is too expensive" and altcoins (intentionally or not) perpetuate this meme by seeming to offer options where the "boat hasn't already sailed"; newcomers sometimes buy into scamcoins because they think Bitcoin doesn't have as much upside potential (which is absurd), and then get burned as a result. It's unfortunate, but true.
They may not confuse you, but to someone just hearing about crypto, the information overload can be a deterrent, whether you like it or not. "Oh goodness, you mean I have to choose a coin now?!"
Basically, it doesn't make sense to be in this subreddit complaining about people not supporting altcoins. Go to their respective subreddits for that stuff.

I would have to think about it. 
If the PR had gone through peer review and the consensus among experts was that it represented a safe upgrade path forward, then I'd probably be receptive to it (and wouldn't sell my holdings in response).
Considering the fact that we already have a community-approved upgrade that *doesn't* represent an irrational compromise, though, there is little chance of consensus forming around such a silly (and politically-oriented) idea. A good old-fashioned UASF (or two) is probably the best way out of this gridlock. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:13:56
First, thanks for your response. Very well said, and you've done a great job of clarifying what you were driving at and solidifying your point - which is sound.


I'm not "missing the point" - I wasn't trying to defend Ver's valuation techniques in the slightest. I was pointing out that the "Bitcoin as bread, network as bakery" analogy was terribly flawed and would not lead to any real insight. I don't want to have this misconstrued as me saying "The Bitcoin market cap should reflect x or y" or anything like that; I don't have any dogs in that fight.


Here you're entirely mistaken, unfortunately. Either the network renders a valuable service, and its tokens are proportionally valuable, or it doesn't (relative to alternative networks) and the tokens are accordingly not valuable. The bitcoins which the network uses as tokens are both *scarce* and *necessary* for usage of the network, so the only way for the network to render a valuable service for anyone is through the usage of those tokens. 
This is **not** me saying "bitcoins will be worth a hundred thousand dollars" here. This is me acknowledging simple economics and basic logic. There is not a way to divorce the network utility from the scarce tokens that represent the ability to participate on that network; they are inextricably linked. Admitting that the network is valuable **is the exact same thing** as admitting the tokens are valuable.


You're absolutely right here.


True; if an alternative network arises that offers significant and backwards-incompatible improvements on the Bitcoin network, it stands to reason that this network should rationally absorb the value that was previously captured by Bitcoin. Every day that passes makes this seem less and less likely, but I am definitely keeping my eyes and ears peeled and perked just in case an altcoin ever seems up to the task. 
Should be fun to watch, at the very least.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:06:50
Your entire argument is: "Nah, it still doesn't have intrinsic value, trust me. I mean, you can't trade *the entire network*, can you?! Ha! Ha!"
No, you can't trade the entire network. You can trade tokens on it. They have intrinsic value, by your own definition, because they are the only means of using the aforementioned network, and they are finite in supply.
You don't have to trade every single gold atom in existence in order for gold to have "intrinsic value" (by your definition), just as you don't need to trade the entire blockchain for individual bitcoins to have intrinsic value.
Your argument is so weak it's funny. But at least you tried to respond, finally; I'll give you that.

You're gullible, pal.
Consider this: the only evidence **whatsoever** regarding a link between Kleiman and Satoshi is from our favorite little clown, Craig Wright.
What do we **know** about Craig Wright? We know that he has lied (and been caught openly red-handed in these lies) more than 5 times in this whole saga. We know that the scripts and code he has posted contained multiple bugs/malicious obfuscation. We know that he pretended that some Sartre speech text document hashed to the same hash of a public transaction Satoshi made years ago. We know he is being pursued for tax evasion and has a history of fraud. We know that he has gone back and retroactively tampered with blog posts to insert fake back-dated evidence to make it seem like he was involved in Bitcoin's creation (years later). We know that he has made multiple promises and then failed to fulfill them. We know that not a single aspect of his story withstands real scrutiny.
...and yet, you think (for some inexplicable reason) that his weird vague claims about Kleiman are solid evidence in favor of Kleiman being Satoshi.
Seriously, be embarrassed.

Once again, just because this is too incredible of an opportunity to pass up... **you forgot entirely what the conversation was about, and thought that you had identified a crucial conditional I left out, and legitimately thought you were going for the jugular and winning the argument.** The irony of your last comment is just wonderful.

Please read the original Bitcoin whitepaper and do a little bit of research into Proof of Work and what it represents and achieves.
Miners are not "a necessary evil" at all; if you think they're "evil" that simply shows you don't understand the blockchain or what it does.
I know how tempting it can be to want to find "the next big thing" and how, without a solid grasp of what the blockchain is, it may seem like "Proof of Stake" is a super duper improvement on the Bitcoin paradigm, but unfortunately PoS actually represents massive steps backwards; it effectively castrates the blockchain model. 
The 2 reasons why PoS has any traction whatsoever are...
1) The actual problem which is solved by a blockchain is a fundamentally difficult concept to understand, and many (like yourself) don't fully grasp the role that PoW plays in this solution.
2) Any altcoin that tried to follow the tried-and-true PoW model would naturally look terrible in comparison to Bitcoin's massive mining network, so devs try to get around that by trying another (fundamentally insecure, though confusingly so) alternative model which can't have its oranges so directly compared to Bitcoin's apples.
You'll have to do your own research and critical thought to fully understand the concepts I'm sharing here.

Nope, you are absolutely and totally incorrect. SegWit transactions are still on the blockchain, including their witness data, which is serialized right along with them directly into the block. If you go look at the bytes that make up a block with SegWit enabled, the transaction data (including the witness portion) is right there, in the block, mixed in with all the non-witness-data as always.
The beauty of it is that the BIP-141 transaction format specification is designed so that *the witness data can be easily stripped away if you want to do so*, which allows witness-stripped blocks to be delivered to clients that haven't yet upgraded to recognize the new format.

Not true. Decentralization confers other benefits on top of censorship resistance, in particular with relation to digital commodities, which might otherwise lack unanimously-enforced scarcity.

You can send actual dollars through other centralized services for less than half a cent in fees, without any exchange rate risk whatsoever.
There is **absolutely** no benefit to BitUSD over real USD. None. I'm sorry that reality is what it is, but the fundamentally centralized DPoS model does not offer any benefits over other cheaper alternatives.

Bitcoin transactions are really cool, but they aren't perfect. Fortunately Satoshi (the inventor of Bitcoin) actually programmed it so that transaction upgrades can happen without breaking the "consensus" that Bitcoin is built on. SegWit is an example of one of these upgrades.
Basically SegWit is a way to reformat transactions so that the "signature" on the transaction can be dealt with separately from the other data in it. This particular upgrade actually allows a *bunch* of other awesome upgrades to Bitcoin, and will help Bitcoin to (safely) handle much more traffic than it can now.

To use the payment network, you need to have bitcoins. They're the only units that can be transmitted via the network.
To have bitcoins, you must buy them. To buy them, you need to provide capital to buy them with.

Wow, you are *really really mad*, and it's funny, because you have nothing to be mad about. I'm sorry your pet theory isn't true, and I'm sorry you don't have any arguments to support it, kiddo.
So it's pretty obvious to anyone who has actually read their respective writings that Satoshi and Nick have different thinking styles, different writing styles, and different visions for what Bitcoin is and is not.
For most semi-intelligent people, this is sufficient to discredit the hypothesis that "OMG WHAT IF NICK IS SATOSHI!?!?!1 WOW WOULDN'T THAT BE CRAZY OMFG!"
But *on top of this*, you have Szabo himself *repeatedly denying that he is Satoshi*, in numerous different contexts. You have people like Wei Dai asserting that [“No, I’m pretty sure it’s not him.”]( You have the fact that Nick Szabo started posting and making public appearances more and more frequently *after* the community started childishly speculating on him being Satoshi, which would make **no sense whatsoever** if he really was Satoshi. 
Nick isn't a C++ programmer, either. 
And as Gwern says:


So we have a veritable **deluge** of reasons why Szabo is not Nakamoto, and anyone with half a brain could see that the theory doesn't hold up to scrutiny. And then *your* entire argument is "I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I HAVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY INCORRECT HYPOTHESIS, THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON YOU FOR SOME REASON!"

Unfortunately, most of what you said is misrepresentative enough that it could reasonably be called an outright lie.


The Bitcoin community hasn't really been "split" in any meaningful sense. A couple of businesses (most importantly Roger Ver's and Jihan Wu's) decided to mine, support, and promote an altcoin, at significant (and ongoing) cost to themselves, and Ver in particular has funded a massive propaganda campaign to feign as if the community *had* split, but in reality the Bitcoin community has remained stolidly pro-Bitcoin throughout the entire kerfluffle. It's about as much of a "split" in the community as the flat-earth movement is a "split" in the scientific community.
At this point, it is generally only the extremely gullible or uninformed who fall for the (admittedly well-funded) narrative and spiel. It's not clear whether you're in one of these categories, or if your motives are more sinister, but regardless, the credibility of Ver (and the other couple of bcash supporters that matter) continues to plummet as their knockoff joke of an airdrop languishes in Bitcoin's shadow.
In any case, plenty of people in the (real) Bitcoin community are fine with block size increases (we *did* activate SegWit, after all... even going so far as to *demand* it via the UASF); what relatively few are fine with is **centralized control of Bitcoin**, which is, ultimately, the impulse that BCH represents.


More accurately, those of us that recognized BCH for the shitcoin that it is were able to cash out (i.e. convert our airdropped holdings to Bitcoin) at **many multiples of the current price ratio**, which has followed the standard shitcoin price trajectory of "early pump followed by successively-less-effective pump-and-dump spurts"... the pattern that I'm sure many of us here know all too well.


Don't make me laugh. Most of the whitepaper focuses on the importance of cumulative work and chain convergence, and Satoshi **strongly** discouraged minority "fork" attempts like what BCH claims to be, *at every opportunity*. Bitcoin is unambiguously the "closest to Satoshi's original whitepaper" as well as Satoshi's "original vision" for Bitcoin; Satoshi was the one who hard-coded in the blocksize limit into Bitcoin's consensus rules, after all, and defended it against a minority-demanded increase whenever the subject was brought up. Pretending like Satoshi would have supported Bcash rather than Bitcoin is the most disgustingly dishonest thing you can do, to the point where it immediately raises questions about your intentions and integrity.


Those are not even *close* to the only "downsides" of BCH. More importantly, it is centrally controlled, laughably insecure, poorly-engineered, and supported by a disproportionately loud and toxic community of (almost exclusively) irrational wannabe-pariahs, and its sole value proposition boils down to "tricking people into thinking it's the real Bitcoin" rather than anything genuinely worthwhile.


...to say the least.


Not even close to accurate. Most transaction fees are on the order of 10¢, and you can almost always get by with less (and have been able to for years now). It's not "congested", it is **popular**, and people are willing to pay to take advantage of Bitcoin's utility and value. More people use Lightning Network than any other smart contract in the world. It is, in fact, arguably the first non-trivial smart contract solution providing true economic value in the real world. The Lightning Network alone boasts more daily active addresses and online nodes than the entire BCH network, on a regular basis.


Time has already told, stop pretending that BCH is anything more than a sad shitcoin and Bitcoin-wannabe.

Here's what you did: you took Bitcoin, a communicative device, and said "without communication isn't this worthless?" Your point is basically "if it's digital in nature, it can't have *intrinsic value* (according to this weird definition I just made up on the spot to suit my current argument)"
The Internet has intrinsic value, if the phrase "intrinsic value" is to be meaningful in any sense. But alone on a desert island without the possibility of communication, the Internet would do you no good. "So it must not have value!" you roar triumphantly...
That's silly.


Then it is a weak idea, concept, or rhetorical tool. It is essentially meaningless if you can't even define it without contradicting yourself.


Sure, I'll agree with your point here. And by any meaningful usage of the term, Bitcoin and its blockchain have a tremendous intrinsic value. Just because they are digital and communicative in nature does not preclude them from being intrinsically valuable, unless you want to deliberately warp the definition of "intrinsic value" to specifically preclude Bitcoin and similar technologies. Which, again, is just silly.

Not a single one of those 20 payments is posted to the chain, so this user opting to use Lightning Network rather than vanilla on-chain transactions will free up 20 transactions' worth of space in a block for other users to use. If a significant subset of users is using Lightning Network, it allows multiple orders of magnitude of more users to transact in Bitcoin.

Not really, and here's why: there is no advantage that BitUSD have over **actual dollars**. They're not accepted at Amazon, or Best Buy, or anywhere outside of a couple peripheral crypto exchanges.
The non-volatility eliminates perhaps the biggest selling point of Bitcoin: chance of financial return or **profit**.
There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will increase in value, of course. But there's a chance, and this is without a doubt its largest driver of consumer adoption.
With BitUSD, there is a guarantee that the asset will **not** appreciate.
I feel bad for Bitshares apologists.

Let's take this point-by-point, shall we?
1, 2, and 10 are done by Elements Alpha and Bitcoin.
3, 5, 6, and 9 are not advantages, just design decisions (and not even necessarily intelligent ones).
4 is laughable and most certainly a *dis*advantage from any rational agent's perspective.
7 *might* be an advantage, but is rather vague so I'm not able to tell for sure.
8 is pure lol
11 is just a repeat of 10.
So that means, out of your eleven bullet points, **maybe one** is an advantage. And honestly, even that's granting a lot of benefit of the doubt.

Ethereum and other altcoins will trend to $0 in the long term. Bitcoin will trend upwards in terms of price.
Altcoins will always look "cheap" relative to Bitcoin, but the problem is that as more and more time goes by, they will get cheaper and cheaper. 
So far, not a single altcoin has been created that has a long-term chance of survival. Alts like Ethereum might one day make useful Bitcoin sidechains, but their standalone chains/ledgers will ultimately die out as the markets come to terms with their nonexistent value propositions.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:31:49
Nope. You are talking nonsense. Expenditures do not cause upward pressure on the price, no way, no how. 
Price is a function of supply and demand. Supply is algorithmically determined in Bitcoin, so the only variable determinant of price is demand. If demand goes up, so does the price. Expenditures do not represent additional demand, so they do not determine price per coin. Only demand does.
If everyone wanted Bitcoin more than they wanted anything else (effectively infinite demand), no one would be spending it and the price would skyrocket. Your hypothesis is trivially invalidated *a priori*.

The terrible model in which computation is performed redundantly by uninterested network nodes, rather than at the edges by the parties to whom the computations/contracts are relevant?

Generally, the "free" in "free" market means "free from government intervention", but I guess you can generalize to "free from any undue influence whatsoever" and render the phrase so hypothetical as to be useless, if you really want to.
In other words, if you want "free market" to mean "a market free from anyone exerting their power or influence in any way" then you basically mean "a hypothetical spherical-cow-in-a-vacuum fantasy market that will never and arguably can never actually exist" and at that point there's really not much room for discussion.
People, including miners and developers and owners of fora and journalists and investors, are allowed to behave in what they consider to be their best interests, whether you like it or not. This is true in any free market.
You might disagree with theymos' moderation policies (hell, I know I do!) but you can't say "oh the market is not free because theymos is the top moderator of one discussion subreddit" without abandoning all pretense of logic. Theymos can do what he wants. Core can do what they want. You can go whine about how a hard-fork is inexplicably necessary even though we're getting a **bigger and safer capacity increase** without risking one, and that is perfectly fine. You can even summon hundreds of sockpuppet accounts and publish hoaxes about "Terminator plans" and other FUD, all you want. That doesn't make this market any less free, it just makes you an enemy of Bitcoin progress.
The market has spoken. Core has a solid scaling strategy, and so far, all other alternatives have been laughably bad, with scant-to-nil serious developer support and no long-term strategies to speak of and nothing but silly sockpuppet brigades and temporarily-rented-McNodes to create the illusion of community support. The subreddit has degenerated into an echo-chamber of unrelenting stupidity and inanity, and even if there *was* a good initial rationale for an exodus from and thus a solid reason for the other sub to exist, unfortunately for you and your conspiratorial cohorts, the quality of dialogue in (censored or not) is absolutely overwhelmingly superior to the cesspool of idiocy that turned out to be. I stop by there from time to time. It is outright laughable.
So, yeah. I understand that you guys  truly do, for the most part, believe in the cause you are championing. The problem is, none of you are intelligent enough to do anything about it, and the rest of us have a global distributed technology we're trying to build and support in the meantime.
You, are probably the creme de la creme, and frankly, I respect you more than I respect pretty much anyone else who takes that place seriously. But I also cringe a little bit when I think about you, because even though you're fairly intelligent, you still haven't managed to take a step back and reevaluate the playing field.
Yes, this place is censored, and yes, that sucks. That doesn't mean we should hard-fork to 2MB blocks, especially since we're getting bigger blocks than that with a soft fork anyway. I sincerely hope somehow I get through to you, and you have a revelation that you are *wasting your time and effort* and *associating exclusively with morons*, so that you can get a grip and rejoin those of us who truly want Bitcoin to succeed, and are fighting for that cause.

It's not a matter of being offended. I can pre-mine a new cryptocurrency with 100,000,000,000,000,000 coins, sell one coin for $1, and then claim I have a larger "market cap" than the US dollar.
The fact that I pre-mined the coin invalidates the market cap figure, for obvious reasons. 
No one is offended. Some of us just understand this point, and some of us are still struggling to. You appear to be in the latter category. That's okay, we all learn at our own pace. Don't hesitate to ask questions when you find yourself confused.

Looks like you're confused here. Ethereum just hard-forked to bail out the contract. If the contract was not a failure of Ethereum, then a hard fork would obviously not occur over it. But the DAO failing **was** Ethereum failing, which is why they scrambled to hard fork and "fix" it. Of course, they did so at the expense of every single selling point Ethereum allegedly used to have...
Now we get to watch the Hot Potato jump around a bit before Ethereum goes the way of the Doge.

Your answer:


I couldn't make this up if I tried. You're quite funny.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:57:17


I didn't say that, nice strawman. It's true that BCH isn't superior to Bitcoin in any real ways, and it's true that it is a centralized shitcoin which can't even compete on low transaction fees against other coins like Dogecoin, Nano, etc... but that doesn't mean that "Bitcoin has zero flaws" and it's silly that you're trying to put words like that in my mouth. It just further hammers home your malicious intent here.


Those are percentages of *time-locked funds*, not nodes. Since the Lightning Network is noncustodial, this doesn't make it centralized or affect the trust model it is based upon in any meaningful way. Someone could come along and put 1,000,000 BTC into Lightning Network payment channels, and control **99%** of the total funds on there, and it wouldn't make Lightning Network any less useful or valuable to the rest of us.


That's not my answer to that at all. My answer is: *you don't seem to understand the Lightning Network model or utility at all, if you think that someone having a bunch of funds in it is a bad or undesirable thing*.


Yes, most fee estimators significantly overestimate the fees necessary to be confirmed quickly, that's well known at this point. I actually made a less-than-ten-cent-fee transaction shortly before my last reply to you, and it confirmed in less than an hour.
If you want or need instant and/or dirt-cheap payments, **that's what the Lightning Network allows**. If you need to check out in a physical store and aren't willing to wait for confirmations (which, even if you're looking for just a single block, could always take half an hour or more due to the fundamental variance in Bitcoin mining) then you are basically singing the Lightning Network's praises without realizing it. No matter how big blocks get or how centralized your Bitcoin-knockoff is, mining still follows a Poisson distribution (once again, see the whitepaper) and confirmations could (and by the nature of statistics, often *will*) take much longer than you are suggesting you're willing to wait.


Every day of my life, actually. Perhaps you need to educate yourself on how traditional (e.g. credit/debit) payments work, behind-the-scenes.


Don't worry, it confirmed quickly as I'd hoped. No luck necessary; I'm not ignorant so I don't overpay in fees, and I have never had an issue getting confirmed in a timely manner.


You did not try to be objective. My previous reply laid out a great number of things that were completely false in your first comment, most of which you conspicuously failed to acknowledge. Your reply contains more untrue (or just severely confused) nonsense which indicates, yet again, that you're not actually having a good-faith dialogue but rather that you're just here to try to shill a centralized shitcoin and trash talk Bitcoin for its continued adherence to Satoshi's vision, while disingenuously pretending like you're "trying to be objective". It's not fooling anyone who is well-informed in the space, and if you're trying to fool the less-informed, shame on you.

It's a terrible comparison. Bitcoins are nothing like bread, and the network is nothing like a bakery.
A better comparison would be against gold. Buying bitcoins is like buying gold. Mining bitcoins is like mining gold (it requires capital to get a mining venture up and running, but you can potentially profit from mining more gold than you could have bought directly with that capital). 
Both gold and bitcoins are scarce in nature, and in a way, buying bitcoins from a miner is financing them just like buying gold from a gold miner is.
This analogy is still imperfect, but it's far and away better than the "Bitcoin is a bakery" atrocity you're trying to throw together.

No one said anything about "perfect and glorious", so quit with the silly strawmen. 
1) For a blockchain to work, it must have a native token.
2) There will always necessarily be transactional friction in changing from one blockchain to another, but not necessarily any such friction in changing to a sidechain.
3) To date, no one has ever produced a single altcoin model that wouldn't work as a sidechain.
4) Finally, there are advantages to larger and more popular protocols. These are called Network Effects.
It is irrational, therefore, to conclude that altcoins will play a meaningful role in the future rather than sidechain implementations of the same ideas.

It would be inconsistent to believe this, and yet not classify inflation of other currencies (e.g. the dollar, bolivar, peso, yuan) in the same way.
Traditionally, inflation is *not* treated or classified as a negative externality. If you want to develop your own little model in which it *is*, you are free to do so, as long as you are consistent in how you apply the label/category to other currencies and commodities (including gold). I'm not sure what benefit there would be to doing so, but if you think you have one, go for it.

If Bitcoin even manages to survive for another decade, its relative rate of inflation would make it more rational to hold/use than any alternative currencies.
People don't seem to appreciate how this incentive scheme is set up. If Bitcoin can coast along, alongside everything else, without any major low-level catastrophes, there is almost no way that it doesn't become a black hole of value.

Bitcoin isn't "terribly slow to make upgrades", we just have large swaths of very intelligent people who are working on **long term, real solutions** to the problems that a decentralized blockchain must work through, and these people are unwilling to compromise Bitcoin's value proposition even when under a veritable siege of completely uninformed idiots demanding a non-solution for the short term.
A hard fork to change the max blocksize to 2MB is a dumb idea. SegWit gets us **bigger** blocks than that, anyway. If you come and propose "Hey, we should hard fork Bitcoin to allow 42 million coins to exist rather than 21!" and then everyone ignores you, you can't then say "Wow Bitcoin is totally slow to upgrade!" based off of our rejection of your proposal. And this is true no matter how many sockpuppet accounts you use to spread your propaganda, and no matter how many McNodes you rent on AWS using their free one-month-trial thing to pad the stats and make it seem like your proposal has meaningful support.

The thing that you're apparently missing is that the image is not a literal depiction of reality, but rather an [analogy](
I'm not defending the image or OP, mostly because it's low-quality content that I would like to see less of in and because the "scaling debate" is a dead horse that's really not worth beating at this point... but I'm still happy to explain the point being made: basically, "attempting to scale in the straightforward-but-naive way is misguided when we could instead prioritize the development of new technology to achieve superior results".


There are quite a few points that can be made here:
1) The Bitcoin community already *did* "compromise on the blocksize" in 2017, replacing the old 1MB limit with a significantly-higher 4M WU limit. It seems that you recognize this fact from your other comments here, so that's good.
2) Right now, Bitcoin isn't even seeing the new, higher limit get fully taken advantage of, indicating that the base-layer throughput is more than sufficient for the current levels of organic transaction activity that we enjoy, and that *another* follow-up increase in the limit isn't a particularly pressing priority or pain-point, all things considered.
3) If given the choice between minimizing the [CONOP]( and maximizing base-layer throughput, it seems that a considerable portion of Bitcoin's userbase would prioritize the former over the latter. This is justifiable for many reasons, but to reduce things down to a digestible summary, let's just say: *decentralization is the number one priority in Bitcoin*, and it's what sets Bitcoin apart from the litany of shitcoins riding on its coattails.
4) Even if we restrict our focus to base-layer throughput (and there is no good reason to do so), there are better ways to maximize that figure than "iNcReaSe tHe BLoCkSizE!!1!" which are unfortunately neglected in the absence of pressure to adopt and/or develop them (e.g. transaction batching and fee-management algorithms/tools), and currently the best-understood, most-obvious, most-direct, and most-powerful form that pressure can take is only manifest when blocks are full (or nearly so) and fees become meaningful to users.
5) There are large, powerful, well-financed actors who have repeatedly demonstrated a lack of moral scruples and an eager willingness to attack Bitcoin in creative and pernicious ways. These antagonists would almost certainly not hesitate to do everything in their power to fracture, confuse, and harm Bitcoin if granted an opportunity to do so; a hard-fork proposal, and in particular one which is contentious (see  above) and/or concerns the blockweight limit, would represent exactly this sort of opportunity. This makes a blockweight-limit-increase an all-risk, almost-no-reward proposal (at least for right now and in the near-term future).
6) According to our best understanding, full blocks are not only *not a bad thing*, but actually *outright beneficial* and perhaps even *necessary* for Bitcoin over medium- or long-term time horizons. No one has yet proposed an even somewhat compelling analysis of what timelines we should be focused on or what the transition period duration(s) should be when it comes to Bitcoin's economic maturation and the epochs thereof, much less one which indicates that working to maximize per-block transaction-space leeway in the short-term is healthy or desirable. Until such analysis takes place and is peer-reviewed and accepted as valid, the premise that "we should strive to make blocks not-full" is arguably backwards. On top of this, disincentivizing chain-bloat is worthwhile in and of itself.
7) Base-layer throughput isn't even necessarily a figure that is worth trying to increase in the first place. Solutions involving secondary or tertiary layers of the Bitcoin stack, including payment-channel-based tech, sidechains, aggregative tools, and the like (e.g. Lightning Network, eltoo, compression techniques, other off-chain approaches, and all the supplemental or complementary tools and tricks that go along with these things) are already available for users who prioritize fast or cheap transactions, and boast the added benefit of *not threatening Bitcoin's fundamental value-add* too. These sorts of things are constantly being improved and updated (largely thanks to the pressure mentioned in  above), and *already* provide noncustodial, trust-minimized mechanisms for virtually-instant and virtually-free Bitcoin payments for those users who want or need them.
This is all off the top of my head, and I could probably keep going, but the main point is that there aren't really any good reasons to demand or champion a hard fork regarding an increase in the blockweight limit right now, and there are *plenty* of good reasons not to. So let's focus on productive things instead.

Andreas argues there that Lightning Network brings privacy benefits to payments which isn't conducive to KYC.
So knowing that electronic cash is a term that specifically refers to **privacy**-centric digital assets, the argument Antonopoulos is making is that Lightning Network makes Bitcoin *too good as e-cash* for privacy-hostile bank-like operations (e.g. Coinbase).
Of course, the argument (whether you agree with it or not) doesn't apply to any exchanges which support privacy-oriented technology like Monero or Zcash.

Not "everyone", obviously, but the main point is still true.
In the months prior to the 2016 halvening (when BTC was trading for ~$500), I predicted that we could reach $10,000+ prices in 2017 after the supply-side effects of the halvening had multiple months to set in. As this prediction came true and we crossed the $10,000 mark, I predicted that the bubble could conceivably reach $20,000+ prices, but that it would certainly fall "60-90%" in the following months after doing so. Before the bubble popped, when I was asked where I thought the new price "floor" might be during the next bear market, my guess was basically "somewhere around $3000" though I'm happy to concede that it could drop even lower than that (especially via a short-lived flash-crash type event, which is something we've seen before in Bitcoin).
Similarly, theymos wrote a ["Don't invest recklessly"]( post last year, warning that "there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point" and that prices could fall to less-than-$2000 figures when this came to pass. We had that post stickied in for multiple weeks, in fact.
The smart thing to do is to pay attention to those who have been around for a while and who have had their arguments validated and proven correct, while ignoring the noisier folks who lack predictive track records and/or sound arguments.

Yes, it's much less of a shitcoin than, say, ether. The problem is not that Monero has no worthwhile innovations included in its codebase, it is that it fundamentally cannot compete with The Blockchain, and would be much better suited as a sidechain.
Every time you bring this up in though, you get nothing but responses which indicate that the responding commenters fundamentally do not understand sidechains.
In my experience, I have never seen someone truly understand what sidechains are capable of who also thinks altcoins like Monero will survive, long-term. You either don't get sidechains or you *do* understand the inevitability of the demise of standalone blockchains like Monero's. The day that someone who *does* understand sidechains is able to explain to me why Monero doesn't work *even better* as a sidechain will be the day that I stop calling it a shitcoin.

Ok, I read the "article", which was actually a Prezi powerpoint, and was quite disappointed. I have come to the sad realization that you're just trying to shill a shitcoin, as I had first thought.
Once again, I make my point, and of course you'll do your best not to acknowledge this simple fact: **everything Monero does and allows works better as a sidechain than as an altcoin**. Boom. End of story. 
You, of course, are invested (both psychologically and financially) in not coming to terms with this truth, so right now as you read my point, I'm sure your mind is frantically trying to justify ways in which what I say is not true. "No, it needs to be a separate coin because, um, tail emission, or because... well..."
No. Sidechains will be perfectly capable of tail emission issuance schedules. The fact of the matter is, *there are good, sound reasons to use a sidechain version of Monero, and to believe that doing so is financially rational*. However, conversely, there are *not* good, sound reasons to believe that as an investment over the long term, Monero will rise in value. It almost certainly will not. In fact, to date, not a single conceived altcoin includes a real rationale for why the model isn't better suited as a sidechain implementation, beyond the fact that a rigorously cryptographically secure two-way peg has not been fully developed yet.
So please don't bother trying to proselytize Monero to me any more. If you're using it to buy drugs online, that's one thing, and I can respect you for it. But if you legitimately think that it is a good long-term investment then the bad news is you haven't put enough thought into this. It's a bad idea, and if you don't take a moment to appreciate the things I'm telling you, you'll probably have to learn this the hard way.

Interesting premise, and I don't necessarily disagree, but the main issue with your argument now is that "useful as a medium of exchange" and "spent a lot" are not synonymous. 
I could possess a token or unit of the most perfect money imaginable, one which can be transported risklessly and frictionlessly and is objectively superior to all alternatives in every monetary function, and if it yields me better returns than any other financial instrument or investment that I'm aware of, you can be sure that I would be in no rush to spend it. We can imagine a universe where such a money exists, and is coveted fanatically by everyone everywhere (i.e. there exists astronomical demand for it), but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is being spent more often than other types of (inferior) monies. Gresham's Law comes to mind.
Naturally, spendability is a desirable feature of any monetary instrument. But it's not as simple as "The more it is spent or the more spendable it is, the more valuable it will be!" (and in fact, the velocity of money is typically inversely correlated with the price of that money; M*V = P*Q).
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:25:11
So the only point of contention here is the definition of the term "shitcoin". Fair enough. Not sure why you downvoted honest discussion, but hey, reddiquette is pretty much dead anyway.
My personal definition of "shitcoin" would be something like: "Any altcoin that will rationally trend towards a value of $0 in the long term." Logically, all altcoins that will ultimately not survive independently beyond the advent of cryptographically-secure Bitcoin sidechains fall into this category for me, including Monero.
If your definition of "shitcoin" is narrower, and is something more like "an altcoin that includes no worthwhile innovations over the Bitcoin model" then Monero won't fall into that category. And that's perfectly fine.
To be clear, I have nothing against Monero's technical features, and look forward to using the sidechains that harken from them when it is appropriate to do so. As far as investments go, though, pretty much any money you put into altcoins (Monero very much included) is money *not* invested into Bitcoin, where it rationally belongs.

You can mine and broadcast blocks that do not include Segwit transactions, but you cannot mine blocks that are invalid under Segwit rules (or more accurately, you *can* mine them, they'll just be rejected by the rest of the network, immediately and permanently orphaned).


It might be worth reading about [what backward compatibility actually is]( Since I can use Segwit-serialized transactions to send to (or receive from) legacy-style Bitcoin addresses, it is indeed a backward compatible upgrade.


You were under a mistaken impression. Were you not around (or not paying attention) to the UASF movement? Bitcoin users and services started running software set up to reject any blocks that *didn't* signal for Segwit activation and support, but by August 1 2017 all Bitcoin miners started mining on Segwit-compatible consensus rules, which meant that no chains or blocks were orphaned.


Segwit **is** a consensus change. All soft forks are.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:55:21


Basically, yes, but replace "users" with "addresses" instead.
This is a simplification, but it is accurate enough for what you're asking.


UTXO stands for "unspent transaction outputs" and they are *both* the "leftover balances" *and* the "sent funds" of any transaction. So, to simplify, if I have a total of 1.0 BTC in one big chunk in my address A, that is a UTXO. If I send half of it to your (originally empty) address B, ignoring fees, that means that the original UTXO is destroyed and that there are now *two* UTXOs created from it: 0.5 BTC in your address B, and 0.5 BTC in my "change address" C.
In this example, any node which processes this transaction would delete the first UTXO (from address A) from its UTXO database, and create the two new UTXOs (in addresses B and C) in its place. So later on, if you spent your coins from address B, the node doesn't have to worry about the old (deleted) UTXO in address A, because it effectively doesn't exist anymore.


Users' balances are the sum of the UTXOs that currently exist in addresses that they have control over. So a wallet has to keep track of all the private keys corresponding to the addresses within it, and when displaying total balance, it will add all of the balances together and show the final result.

Most Bitcoiners don't actually seem to demand that. Instead, they want politicians to remain as hands-free and non-intrusive as possible.

Most of what you wrote is true, but let's be honest: the bubble *will* pop. The real question is: how high does it reach before it does, and how low does it dip after it does?
Saying "Bitcoin's in a bubble" doesn't tell you much, even though it's true. If the bubble is going to top at $4k and fall back down to $800, that's one thing... if it tops out at $15k and falls back down to $4k, that's quite another. Neither is an impossible outcome.

My definition of "shitcoin" is "any crypto token which should, over the long-term, trend towards a value of 0 BTC".
Monero is definitely in that category, as is Litecoin, as is Ethereum. Each of these blockchains will be Bitcoin sidechains before long, and as there's no additional value to having standalone blockchains, the sidechain implementations will naturally persevere and prosper due to the network effect.
Others can define "shitcoin" as something more restrictive, like "a coin that provides no worthwhile innovations over the Bitcoin model whatsoever" but when we're talking about *investments*, as we are right now, I think my definition is more appropriate.

Not sure why you would think or say this. ETC is more valuable than ETH-F right now, despite a lower hashrate. It is therefore in every miner's immediate interest to mine the more-lucrative and less-competitive (not to mention less-mutable) ETC. This should, unless somehow interrupted, create a feedback loop that culminates in a mass exodus from ETH-F.
At that point, anything can happen, but it's clear that ETH-F is looking awful fucked.

I appreciate the kind words.
I believe that Bitcoin will surely reach new all-time-highs in the future, but right now I don't have any good guesses on how long this will take. There are so many factors to consider at this point (halvening timelines, altcoin growth and general ecosystem fragmentation, disinformation portals like Bitcoin-dot-com, institutional entrants and ETF/futures-related phenomena, second-layer development, etc) that it's gotten exceptionally difficult to predict how the future might specifically unfold.
The market increased in terms of depth/liquidity so much over the past decade, and the volatility-related implications (in particular with respect to other cryptocurrencies) *really* complicate any sort of predictive reasoning... and on top of it all, there's "market reflexivity" to take into account; at some point it seems like the "obvious patterns" of Bitcoin's price history (like the run-ups that occur in the months following each reward halvening) will start to be recognized by "Mr. Market" and have their impact(s) felt sooner or more *efficiently* than in prior days. But there's no obvious trend in the cycle-lengths that I can see: up until late 2013, it seemed like things were "accelerating", with each successive Hype Cycle coming quicker and quicker on the tails of the last one... but then Mt. Gox collapsed and we experienced an unprecedentedly-long bear market.
Anyway, sadly, the bottom line here is that I currently don't have a strong opinion on how long we'll have to wait to see new all-time-highs. Things have gotten very complex and it's really hard to consider every variable thoroughly at this point.

No, you completely misunderstand soft forks. A soft fork involves the implicit orphaning and rejection of now-out-of-consensus blocks. The economic incentives drive miners not to bother even *trying* to mine/produce such blocks, which is why not many blocks are orphaned in practice by soft forks on Bitcoin mainnet, but the following sentences are *completely* incorrect:


The problem (and logical breakdown) here is that you (and Kalin101) are assuming:
1) New consensus rules are enabled (which reject blocks with coinbase rewards in excess of 0.25 BTC).
2) A subset of miners ignore these consensus rules, continuing to mine the old coinbase amounts.
3) These miners' blocks are orphaned by the miners who *do* honor the new consensus rules, which has led you to the (completely mistaken) conclusion that "This wouldn't be a soft fork because soft forks don't result in incompatibilities and blocks being orphaned like this, that's their 'merit'."
You fail to realize that *any* soft fork (including Segwit and P2SH) would result in blocks being orphaned **if a subset of miners ignored the new consensus restrictions of that soft fork** (step 2 above). It is a *fundamental* misunderstanding on your part, and indicates that you need to do more research before trying to weigh in on discussions like this.

My primary point was that it shouldn't have a negative effect on demand, because the merchants who are immediately "cashing out" all their Bitcoin through Bitpay never represented true economic demand in the first place. But I see now that I actually said something quite different than this. Thank you for the correction.

In this case, whoever leaked the original data definitely acted out of malice (the usage of malware pretty much categorically establishes so). Whether that person was the *same* person who wrote the infamous Willy Report based upon the leaked data is an open question, though I would say it's definitely the simplest and most obvious hypothesis there is. 
Combined with the rhetoric, I still think that the writer of the report seems to have been acting out of malice. In any case, whether we chalk it up to stupidity or malice, the end conclusion is the same: the Willy Report is elaborate fan fiction.

No, all Lightning Network channels are smart contracts operating fully on the main chain, no sidechains are involved. Not every intermediate payment *through* a Lightning channel will be published to the main chain, only the beginning (opening) and finalization (closing) transactions are. But the intermediate transactions are not on separate blockchains or sidechains of any sort, they're simply managed in users' wallet software just like private keys are.

I personally do believe that Bitcoin is poised to shape the world like the Internet has/is, and would argue that it does represent a revolution of sorts.


Both. I think of Bitcoin as **money**, meaning that its utility is both in terms of a "store of value" *and* as a "medium of exchange". Eventually, hopefully, it will be a common "unit of account" too, but we're not there yet.
In terms of what we should focus on improving or preserving from an engineering standpoint, I would definitely argue that the "store of value" should be the primary concern of the underlying network and protocol. I argue this because I think it's pretty clear that the primary driver of adoption during these early years is the speculative investment potential and profit opportunity. Financial returns are universally-relevant and powerful incentives, and like it or not, most people are "in it for the money" in some way or another.
If we ever reach a point where a significant fraction of society *actually* believes in the value of Bitcoin, to the point where they demand it themselves, then payments in Bitcoin would naturally rise. However, it would be a function of *demand* (people preferring to be paid in bitcoins) rather than the mostly-illusory "send Bitcoin to payment processor who sends fiat to merchant" arrangements we see right now. While these are nice options to have and it's good that Coinbase and BitPay (and a few others) offer such services, it isn't a driver of adoption and it doesn't really leverage Bitcoin's special value or utility. Alternative payment-processing scenarios can be as smooth as waving smartphone or smartwatch towards a scanner, after all.
We might eventually reach that "success" point, though, if the network continues to function reliably and the ecosystem continues to grow (which it seems to do in almost-eerily self-similar "Hype Cycles" of increasing magnitude) like it has over the past decade. I'm confident that if we *do* get there, the surface-level end-user experience of transacting will be perfected without too much ado.
In other words, I'm not too worried about the "currency" side of things, because I think it will naturally work itself out over time.

To mine a block, it generally takes tens of quadrillions of attempts (hashes). Adding a transaction (or a few thousand transactions) into the block does not slow down the mining process in any meaningful way (not even 0.0000001%).
The problem here is that you're not accustomed to thinking in terms of the relevant scale(s). Beyond that, there are the fees that are included with transactions (an integral part of Bitcoin's design) and the overall system health, of which price per coin is a function, both serving as economic incentives to include transactions in blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:40:23




Lightning Network enables *instant* and *trust-free* Bitcoin transactions, which is quite literally impossible by definition on the lowest layer. Beyond that, it will make possible *orders of magnitude* scaling returns without correspondingly large costs to the network on a macroscopic level (what with the blockchain being massively redundantly hosted and processed). To reduce it to a soundbite: it represents scaling *the smart way*.


It requires consensus, because that is how Bitcoin works, on a technical level.

Using Core (testnet) you can use the addwitnessaddress call:


You can also use any Electrum version &gt;2.8.0 to make a SegWit transaction (either on Bitcoin's testnet or on Litecoin's mainnet). I don't have the explicit instructions on-hand (and am on mobile at the moment), but if I recall correctly it is a fairly straightforward process.

You're referring to the whitepaper that describes how Bitcoin's mining process is deliberately designed to be analogous to gold mining? The one which has most of its content dedicated towards explaining how proof-of-work engenders chain convergence incentives?
I think it's pretty clear that most members of the Bitcoin community understand the whitepaper, especially relative to the various little anti-Bitcoin communities (especially those that desperately try to emphasize "cash" in the subtitle, rather than "peer-to-peer", in apparent ignorance of the fact that "electronic cash" is a decades-old term-of-art in applied cryptography). It's also pretty clear that most of us here understand that Bitcoin is considerably more versatile than gold when it comes to digital contexts, which is why there is so much innovation (and celebration of said innovation) in terms of extending the "Bitcoin stack" in valuable (and sustainable) ways.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:10:10
Fair enough. I'll do so at the top of thread.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:09:16
Not only can you not guarantee anything of the sort, but your premise is hilariously ridiculous to begin with.
The only assumption that we can reasonably make about miners is that they are economically rational, i.e. that they would prefer more profits over less profits. This is a foundation underpinning Bitcoin's operating model.
A truth that most the less-intelligent tend to overlook is that in many cases, miners' incentives and interests are directly opposed to those of non-mining users. The wider Bitcoin userbase would prefer there to be as many disparate, competing, non-colluding mining entities as possible because this ensures censorship resistance, immutability of the disinflationary monetary policy, and systemic resistance to powerful (e.g. nation-state-level) network antagonists. In contrast, each distinct mining entity would prefer to have as much control and hash-share as possible, so as to maximize both profits and their influence or power in the space. Similarly, users want to pay as little as possible in transaction fees, while miners would prefer higher transaction fees because these fees *go to the miners*.
The one dimension in which users and miners are in clear alignment on is that of trading-price-per-coin, which both groups would prefer to be maximized. The best way to maximize this, of course, is to ensure that Bitcoin delivers on the *unique* promises that it grants, relative to alternative systems. Almost every one of these stems directly from Bitcoin's decentralized architecture; any meaningful value-add of Bitcoin is inarguably a product of this.
If two or three thousand house-payment transactions were being processed every ten minutes (which is what your "few people using it" scenario would be, assuming base-layer per-block capacity remains at its current levels) then miners would likely be compensated very handsomely. You could certainly crunch the numbers to achieve the same sort of miner compensation with "tiny fees and 70% of the world population using Bitcoin for minor daily transactions" but not while keeping the chain affordable to validate for more than one or two large controlling entities. That would represent an unambiguous sacrifice of all the benefits of decentralization, including any sort of regulatory arbitrage, any form of reliable monetary policy, and the whole "elimination of trust in counterparties" that the Bitcoin whitepaper describes and that the community currently aspires to achieve or preserve.
Fortunately, though, because a lot of people in Bitcoin are intelligent engineers who are patient and wise enough to take a multi-year (or multi-decade) outlook on these matters, the foundations have been established and are currently being iteratively improved upon which allow users of Bitcoin to reap *both* the decentralized, self-sovereign values *and* the low-friction, fast-and-cheap transactability that many are looking for. The only ones who fail to recognize this are either gullible enough to have fallen for a scammer's sales brochure or simply lack the knowledge/insight required to understand the subject on a level deep enough to form a reasonable perspective on it. The solution, of course, is to simply explain what these people are missing or overlooking when appropriate, and to ignore them if or when they demonstrate an unwillingness to learn.

No, what Karpeles *actually* admitted and said is [documented here]( He denied accusations of embezzlement and claimed that Mt. Gox managed its liabilities via an "obligation exchange"... then Kolin Burges, who [attended the trial without an interpreter]( went on to tweet this as "[Karpeles admits operating Willy bot]( this tweet went on to be quoted in (and form the foundation of) numerous articles.
To interpret Karpeles' testimony/plea in 2017 as a confirmation of the content in The Willy Report is unwise and misrepresentative. The trial didn't even pertain to any automated trading, nor to accounts that the Report claimed were associated with Willy, nor even to Mt. Gox's collapse; it concerned alleged individual embezzlement and Karpeles' own personal, manually-operated trading account.

So, to you, $1000 would not improve your life enough right now to warrant removing the opportunity you think you have at earning another $9000 in this next year by not spending it.
Great. Don't spend it, then. In fact, if you have more money to spare, put it into Bitcoin (if you really expect us to get to $10k sometime in the near future).
If you *don't* expect it to go up, then "cashing out" at $1000 is fine, and you should enjoy the profit you got from being patient between the $300 and the $1000 price-sticker. The day that the current value of your BTC outweighs the future earnings potential you gauge it to reasonably have, you can spend it or convert it to fiat.

Fees are voluntary, and to be honest right now there are often no fees at all in practice when sending Bitcoins anywhere. Over time, though, they're expected to start playing a larger role (to continue providing miners with incentive to mine, when the block rewards are tiny). Bitcoin is very much in its infancy.
By the way, I have been fanatically researching everything remotely related to Bitcoin for the past 6 months, and like nothing more than to discuss what I've come to learn with anyone who's interested. At any point at all, let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer.

Covert ASICBOOST is, by definition, not incontrovertibly detectable. The only signs that it is being exploited would be an irregular ordering of transactions and/or a statistical tendency towards more empty blocks than other mining operations. Bitmain have exhibited both (their transactions are regularly unusally ordered, and they mine far more empty blocks than any other pools). This is not definitive proof of them using covert ASICBOOST, though.
They have invested tens of millions of dollars into modifying their chip design (and fab factories' production process) to ensure that their hardware is able to run ASICBOOST. They have also gone out of their way to attempt to patent (and legally monopolize) the usage of this exploit. 
In other words, it's obvious that Bitmain has been exploiting the covert ASICBOOST vulnerability. It is also obvious that you are not here to actually learn more and have a genuine discussion, because all of the above is already well-known.

The "Bitcoin Days" metric is what you're looking for, most commonly referred to in the context of another metric: Bitcoin Days Destroyed.
Basically, if you leave 1BTC at an address for 10 days, unmoved, that "creates" 10 Bitcoin Days. Moving it on the eleventh day would "destroy" all 10 of those Bitcoin Days. Similarly, leaving 10 coins untouched for 1 day will "create" 10 BDs. Leaving 10BTC unmoved for 10 days means that 100 BDs are created (which are destroyed when they move). You get the idea.
This metric doesn't single-handedly answer all the questions you may want to ask on this front, but it is a good statistic to keep an eye on, and seems to be (at least part of) what you're asking for. Sometimes when the Bitcoin Days Destroyed spikes up appreciably, it precedes a sizable sell-off (price drop), as it can indicate an early holder moving their coin stash (which might indicate intent to sell).

I don't think that "infinity" is the value/price it will converge upon; it would more likely be something like "the cumulative value of all non-Bitcoin assets, divided by the total supply of circulating bitcoins" (with a margin of error to account for market inefficiencies), which would only occur if the market achieves full saturation (i.e. adoption reaches/approaches 100% of humanity).

No, no, no, no, no.
The size of the blocks decreases geometrically over time. [See this chart](
This means that there is not going to be some sudden day where people are freaking out over the last Bitcoin being mined... instead, every 4 years the size of a block just cuts in half. Long before we reach 2140 (the estimated year when the final, 21 millionth, Bitcoin is mined) the block reward is going to be a minor portion of the incentive to continue mining. 
The way it's supposed to work is that gradually, over time, the fees paid on the transactions (to prioritize them over other transactions vying to be included in the blocks) will take over the role of "miner incentive" - in other words, people would still be running their ASICs, but to garner the BTC fees that transactors are willing to pay to have their transactions verified (rather than to gain the block reward, which will be tiny or nonexistent eventually).
Another poor assumption is that Bitcoin is valued for the anonymity it provides. The most marvelous appeal of Bitcoin transactions is that they are so darned cheap compared to the alternative methods of e-commerce. Try moving money through the Internet or across the world in any other way and enjoy institutional fees; do so with Bitcoin and pay virtually nothing.

You're generally pretty on-the-mark, but this one leaves a bit to be desired. You say "If you make it too expensive" but the cost per transaction is not the result of some single person saying "I think I'll make fees *this* expensive!" 
Transaction fees are the result of a complex web of checks-and-balances wherein a rent-seeking cartel is literally powering the network *as a byproduct* while network users bid to compete in an open market for space in the ever-growing Bitcoin ledger. They are an emergent phenomenon.
Seeing as how they are literally *necessary* for the survival of the network, in the long term, it should not be terrifying to see layer-one fees rise to levels that make rational actors hesitate before unnecessarily dumping data into the ledger (which, of course, is a behavior that inevitably increases validation costs network-wide).

Sure, there are "a number of possible use cases for Ethereum", just like there are a number of possible use cases for cicada shells. The thing is, for each of these use cases, there is a smarter, more efficient, cheaper, and less ridiculous alternative solution or solution-enabling platform.

You have not demonstrated the ability to do so here. In fact, as I've pointed out multiple times already: **you have blatantly avoided acknowledging almost every single fact I have presented you**, apparently doing your best to dodge every meaningful point raised response to your comments.

Instead of taking into account what I have pointed out, you've [thrown strawman arguments and sloppy misunderstandings at me]( [demanded txids that wouldn't even prove anything]( [responded with impotent ad hominems]( and [mindlessly repeated that you are "objective"]( despite all available evidence clearly indicating otherwise.

So far, you've been awkwardly unwilling to do so. You just keep repeating (as if trying to convince yourself) that I am "blinded" and that you are "objective and understanding", but I doubt even *you* buy it at this point.

Day traders are **great** for Bitcoin.
Think about your average day-trader. He hears about Bitcoin, decides to try his hand at it.
He either...
1) Loses some money on a bad call, because Bitcoin is so darn unique. 
2) Gets in, gets out, enjoys a little profit from doing so.
In scenario  the trader basically just gives his money away to the Bitcoin community. It's like a "Bitcoin donation" that we all split among ourselves. They will probably not be returning to Bitcoin for a while because they think it's a scam or that it's not for them. Fine! Thanks for the money.
In scenario  the trader managed to escape unscathed. They actually *took* money from Bitcoin. 
But here's the thing... in scenario  the trader is going to initially be proud of himself and will probably manage to resist coming back to Bitcoin for a little while... but if it keeps growing while he's away, and he keeps seeing potential profits that he's missing out on, eventually he's going to say, "You know what, *I* made money in Bitcoin. Other people are making money in Bitcoin. Maybe I should grab a couple more and just see how things go for round 2."
Then they're back, and they're injecting more money into the system.
So either way, as long as Bitcoin is plodding along fine without any given individual trader (spoiler: it is) then ultimately any traders getting involved in Bitcoin will probably end up contributing their funds to the cause, regardless of how well they do.

Hey man, I want to check back and ask a quick question: did you ever expand the full headers in that email? Where was it sent from?
As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the email *did* ask for a valid bank account number (multiple times) which screams **SCAM** to me. Also, they used *no* specifics in the email with which to identify your account. And finally, if you were able to successfully withdraw all your funds from Bitstamp without a problem that seems to indicate your account was functioning normally (further indicating the source of this email may not, in fact, be Bitstamp). 
You didn't mention any "ACCOUNT PENDING TERMINATION" alerts or anything when you logged into the website, either...
It sounds like it's very likely some scamming fuck managed to "spook" you out of Bitstamp. Fortunately you only responded back to the scammer themselves (and with no mention of a bank account number!), so you've had no correspondence with the real Bitstamp other than withdrawing your bitcoins suddenly. After double-checking the full headers (and confirming where the email came from, as much as you can) you might just want to "buy back in" and continue business as usual.

No, Segwit was originally developed without a blocksize limit increase included. The blocksize being lifted from 1MB to 4M WU was a compromise to the "big blockers" of the time. Segwit2x was a closed-door corporate takeover attempt with pretty much *zero* developer support and *very* scant support in the wider Bitcoin community. Fortunately, Bitcoin is decentralized and was underestimated by the attempted dictators, ultimately resisting the takeover attempt spectacularly.


It was actually [called off shortly before the "2X" part was supposed to activate]( (and the fact that it *could* even be called off by a tiny committee shows just how much of a centralized initiative it was in the first place). You're right, though, that the code was hilariously buggy (due to lacking any peer review whatsoever) and wouldn't have activated or worked properly even if it hadn't been called off.


I didn't say "4MB" anywhere in my comment, I said "4M WU" instead. Blocks in Bitcoin are now limited according to *weight* rather than *size*, and the fact that you don't seem aware of the distinction(s) made in my previous comment indicates that you may not have been reading it closely enough.


1) That doesn't cover point 
2) What you said in the linked comment isn't even accurate in the first place.


That may well be true, but it's not relevant to anything that I've said. To reiterate something that my previous comment already included (in multiple sections): if you want near-instant and near-free Bitcoin transactions, they're possible already. Pretending otherwise is disingenuous to the point where suspicion of your motives is warranted.


That's not the only weakness/disadvantage/vulnerability incurred by increased costs of validation and node operation, nor is that the standard definition of centralization. Ease of collusion, while important, is less of a concern than preserving both legislative arbitrage and the inherent veto power that consumer-run nodes are granted in Bitcoin's consensus model, both of which are paramount in terms of defensibility against *truly* powerful entities that might one day try to thwart Bitcoin or the liberties it grants us (e.g. disgruntled nation states or banks).


Soft forks in general don't require the same degree of unanimity that hard forks do, but it is inaccurate to say that only 40% of the Bitcoin ecosystem (or even only 40% of the Bitcoin *mining* ecosystem) signaled support for Segwit. In fact, *100%* of miners signaled support of Segwit by the UASF activation deadline, which was no coincidence and should make perfect sense to anyone who understood the game theory of the situation.


Craig Wright never got "trounced" by any decentralized systems, though I do recall that a certain centralized altcoin was able to *survive* despite his support of a comparably-centralized spinoff fork from it... which isn't a particularly impressive feat, anyway (especially considering the fact that consensus-redefining checkpoints were introduced by the central planners in the effort to "win" this ridiculous "war"). But it's not like this is relevant, anyway; centralized altcoins hard fork all the time, and accordingly don't actually offer any truly sound monetary policy (or technical foundations) like Bitcoin proper does.


Once again, you're missing the point. Not only that, but you're skipping over the bulk of what you're quoting, seemingly deliberately. It is seeming more and more obvious that you're here with an agenda, rather than to have a serious discussion or to educate yourself on the things that you're overlooking and misunderstanding.


That's probably at least partially because you have selectively ignored most of the points that I raised in my previous comment, and are most likely in the habit of doing so whenever you're confronted with facts (and opinions) that you don't want to acknowledge. 


Exactly, which is why the 1MB limit was deprecated and replaced with a higher limit (4M WU) in Segwit. A balance *was* struck, and we're still in the process of leveraging the introduced improvements and capacity increase(s) to the extent that is accordingly possible.


You're not even *trying* to represent things honestly at this point. You're not "forced" to use the Lightning Network at all, unless you want near-instant transactions. Fees of 1sat/vbyte are routinely confirmed in Bitcoin (and if Bitcoin's satoshis are 10 or 20 or 100x more valuable than shitcoins' base-units, that's an unambiguous symptom of success). If you'd like to enjoy lower (even sub-satoshi) fees, then yes, you will need to use something other than the base-layer, because the other users on the network don't have to (and don't want to) subsidize your payments. Pretending that you're "forced" to use the Lightning Network is just ridiculous. Get out of here with that nonsense.


Not so; you may be thinking of non-networked payment channels.


You don't have to open a channel to "a place nearby that you solicit" at all, that's what is so nice about the "Network" part of "Lightning Network". If you're just here to misrepresent things as if they work in ways that they don't, you're not fooling anyone.


I suspect this is an imaginary situation that you've concocted to try to spread a malicious and untrue narrative, but hey, maybe you really *did* experience such a situation... however, I wonder if it was relatively recently or whether it was a while ago (when Lightning was significantly less mature), and whether you were doing something silly or misguided during the process (perhaps even intentionally). Glancing over your comment history, it seems like you're the type that might go out of your way to make a mistake so that you can later blame the technology (rather than being more honest about the experience).


It's not a matter of whether "I prioritize it", it's a matter of there being zero good reasons to demand or champion a hard fork regarding an increase in the blockweight limit right now, and plenty of good reasons not to.


Yes, you're right about that. Mostly, it has come to light how small, toxic, disproportionately-loud, centralized, morally-bereft, and clearly-wrong the "BiG bLoCks At aLL cOsTs!" faction truly is, while true Bitcoin has continued growing and thriving and improving.


So you're willing to ignore and conspicuously sidestep almost every point I raise, misrepresent numerous different incidents and technologies, and then dismiss the reasoning and perspective of what seems to be the clear majority of Bitcoin users... and then wrap it all up with "we'll agree to disagree". Not exactly a surprise at this point.
If you feel like going back to my previous comment and actually taking the time to understand and address the points within it, wonderful. Otherwise, there's no need to respond with more vacuous and disingenuous drivel.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:22:54

On a similar note, a lot of people get really bent out of shape over Satoshi allegedly controlling a huge hoard of coins...
Who deserves those coins most of all? I'd rather they were in Satoshi's possession than anyone else's, not only because he is the cause behind all of this and deserves a reward, but because he has demonstrated incredible restraint in "cashing out" at all... He is a stabilizing force on the market and for now should be seen as nothing but a benefactor.

In fact "electronic cash" is a term of art in applied cryptography. It was many decades old by the time Bitcoin was created, and Bitcoin's key differentiating aspect from the e-cash systems that predate it is the **peer-to-peer** element.
The definition of electronic cash is basically a privacy-oriented, cryptographically-transferable digital bearer asset. Bitcoin unambiguously qualifies as such, of course, and it is worth noting that *even if median fees per on-chain transaction skyrocket in Bitcoin*, it would continue to qualify. In fact, fees have been an integral part of Bitcoin's design since day one, a required component over the long term.
What is particularly great about Bitcoin is that the users who really prioritize low fees and/or instant payments have decentralized applications like the Lightning Network which allow them to get what they want from Bitcoin, **without compromising the peer-to-peer foundation that differentiates Bitcoin from other types of e-cash**. The bottom layer of the Bitcoin stack is not necessarily the best place for low-value, low-economic-impact transactions and activities to be processed, because the bottom layer must be redundantly processed and validated by any peer on the network (including the peers who onboard in the future). Other layers don't suffer this burden in the same way.
Imagine if every Netflix movie you watched *required* every other peer on the Internet to validate your stream. That simply wouldn't be sustainable from a network perspective, and we would have an Internet that is radically centralized (even more than the status quo) and accordingly less valuable or societally transformative. Fortunately, we don't need all Internet peers to come to consensus for you to stream your movies and TV shows, but we *do* need to come to consensus in Bitcoin for you to ensure that your coins are where you expect or hope for them to be without involving a counterparty and the third-party risk it would introduce.
So if you know what the definition of electronic cash is, you know that Bitcoin is exactly that, and if you know why Bitcoin is valuable and useful, you know that trying to handwave away the inevitable free-rider problem won't allow the system to sustainably scale while preserving its underlying value.

All facts considered, the "Willy Report" looks like it was probably a manipulative farce. When the source data it is based on "leaked" it was bundled with bitcoin-stealing malware. The source data was *nowhere near* complete, missing huge sections of trade data. Even worse, the missing data was *randomly* absent, not just a straightforward partial dump, which strongly implies that the data was doctored (likely significantly) before being leaked. To date no one has offered an even semi-plausible alternative explanation as to why the data set was incomplete in the manner that it was. The report itself made a number of suspicious and spurious jumps in logic interspersed with plenty of wild conjectures, and seemed to deliberately pander to existing conspiratorial narratives (essentially positioning itself as "confirmation" of other rumors at the time). The language in the report was (obviously and deliberately) phrased to imply or assert that Bitcoin's market behavior during the latter half of 2013 was largely due to the (very possibly falsified) Markus/Willy trading and a grand Mt. Gox conspiracy which ultimately didn't even make logical sense and ignores both Gox's alleged incentives at the time as well as multiple other publicly-recognized data points from the period. To top it all off, the person who seems to have put such obsessive work and research into this topic (which should also set alarm bells ringing, as yet another red flag in this ordeal) is not of any repute and has not produced any other notable works or analysis, either before or since.
All in all, the Willy Report should be viewed as "malicious fan fiction" rather than a serious analysis.

**BIP** stands for Bitcoin Improvement *Proposal*.
**ASIC** stands for Application-Specific Integrated *Circuit*. 
**Bitmain** 
A company that allegedly manufactures hardware responsible for approximately 70% of the network's current hashrate. They were caught spending money to patent and produce chips with **covert ASICBoost** capabilities (i.e. the exploitation of a vulnerability in Bitcoin's proof-of-work implementation which we now know can be fixed with a witness commitment soft fork requirement). This may well be the single worst centralization hazard in Bitcoin.
Though Bitmain have publicly denied that they use this technology on the main network (despite the significant expenditures clearly put forth to make them capable of doing exactly that), all empirical evidence and point towards this being an untrue claim. Preserving the advantage that ASICBoost exploitation provides Bitmain seems to be the primary rationale behind miner-resistance to SegWit. Bitmain were also later found to have embedded remotely-exploitable (and man-in-the-middleable) backdoor software in their miners, called **Antbleed**, which they only acknowledged after it was independently discovered by external security auditors.
In other words, Bitmain is a highly controversial company that has a long track record of behavior that is malicious from the perspective of the rest of the Bitcoin network's users.
**Bitcoin Unlimited** 
A malicious governance attack against Bitcoin. [The project, in general, is notoriously incompetent.](
**Blockstream** 
Bitcoin application developers, most famous for their pioneering research work into *sidechains* (modular extensions to Bitcoin which give it all the powers of any other blockchain, but while preserving the 21 million coin limit) and their widely-acclaimed defensive patent license, setting the bar for other companies in the space. They are indeed the target for many conspiracy theories in the fringe anti-Bitcoin subreddits, despite their considerable contributions towards Bitcoin protocol maintenance and development.
**Jihan Wu** 
The owner of Bitmain, controversial due to his role in mining-centralization, his antagonistic tweets and rhetoric, the covert ASICBoost exploitation he has apparently been abusing and fighting to preserve, the Antbleed revelations and what they revealed about Bitmain, and his [recent threats to attempt to attack Bitcoin by privately mining a majority-hashrate altcoin under his sole control and attempting to brand it as "Bitcoin"]( Jihan Wu is arguably the primary party responsible for the (relatively) high fee rates that Bitcoin has touted for the past six months.

Good point, well said.
But with Bitcoin wallets, the "safe" can never *really* be "owned" - all "safe"s exist before we ever get around to using them... we just pick one (at random) to store our Bitcoin balances in. So saying "this wallet is mine!" is identical to saying "I have the key to this safe!" - if someone else has the key, too, but just hasn't used the safe to store anything, they could claim ownership just as much as you do *of the safe itself*. 
Clearly, it's still theft - they only watched that safe for the express purpose of withdrawing others' Bitcoins that were sent to it, and never truly intended to use it for safekeeping of their own funds. But the abstractness of the entire operation is fun to muse upon.

I don't have any "beliefs" on the matter. The Silbert Agreement said a "hard fork to 2MB". That's that. Anything else you add in ("doubling capacity", "8M blockweight", etc) is a subjective and personal interpretation... **and would still be COOP-compatible anyway**.


Doubling the base blocksize to 2MB (so that non-SegWit transactions can take up to 2MB of space) **cannot** be done as a soft fork, actually.

I believe was basically saying: "At a *minimum* bitcoins are tethered to real-world value/expenditure through the input costs (electricity/hardware) required to participate in the mining process" i.e. bitcoins cannot be "free" in the traditionally-understood sense. You're not wrong, but neither is he.


Checking credit history is not free. What ends up happening with **credit card transactions is usually a 1-3% fee plus a $0.20 baseline fee**. This prohibits microtransactions, for one, and is also generally undesirable for obvious reasons. 
**Bitcoin reduces this to 0-1% fees** (closer to 0 than to 1, too). 
There are other arguments in favor of Bitcoin, too, obviously... but that's really all you should need to know.

If you can generate a Bitcoin address, you can receive Bitcoin. All you have to do is provide your Bitcoin address (you can paste it on the web-page or bill of sale or wherever) and they can send you the BTC and show you the payment on the blockchain.

If you sell a Bitcoin on Mt. Gox, it gives you the $ in your Gox account.
Then if you want to withdraw that $ (and get it **out** of Mt. Gox) you have to initiate the process and wait and hope. 
As far as I understand it, you will not be getting that money for at least a month, if that. Most people wait weeks and then just cancel the withdrawal and buy back their BTC instead. 
In short: *you can't really withdraw USD from Mt. Gox*.

Everything that you just wrote is false and deliberately misrepresentative. It is also (unsurprisingly) naive, failing to take into account the power of splicing, submarine swaps, channel factories, and other such options.
The truth is that the Lightning Network is ready today, and ready in a way that doesn't ignore the fundamental limitations of distributed consensus or undermine the value of the host network. By contrast, most altcoins simply make the trade-off of maximizing base layer throughput at the cost of decentralization and the preservation of self-sovereignty, and hoping that most people are too ignorant to realize the costs incurred. You're living, breathing proof that the strategy "works" in the short term, but that's not something to be proud of.

@_date: 2013-12-27 23:53:00
I agree with you, Bitcoin falls under the high-risk category... but for the sake of playing Devil's Advocate....


You mean "Bitcoin holders move to the more profitable altcoin and continue to enjoy absurdly lucrative gains, especially because we're going to be the first to recognize its superiority considering we understand the mechanics of the system better than those who are not Bitcoiners."
This is not a doomsday scenario, it would be a fantastic opportunity for the community. We're savvier in this domain. We'll do better than fine.


One huge selling point of Bitcoin is it is a trustless model. Take that away and you're left with "basically the same thing we already had" and the bankcoin doesn't sound like it confers any actual superiority to Bitcoin. Would it still be a distributed mining protocol? If not, it's not really cryptocurrency, it's just "funbux". The only way to get people to adopt that new thing would be to promise them returns on it that they weren't getting otherwise. Where do those returns come from? 
This is basically saying "what if the banks gave out free money to adopt a new game they made up?" Sure, I'd sign up. Then I'd cash out and buy BTC with that free money.
You can't strip out fundamental aspects of cryptocurrency and expect it to work equally well. There are so many problems and pitfalls to this that I don't even know where to begin. If you would like to outline more details of your proposed "bankcoin" I would be glad to point out exactly why it wouldn't work. I am confident I would be able to.


It's called "cornering the market" and it's a lot harder in practice than you're imagining (though of course not impossible). If they wanted to do this, they would have to make us rich first. Or they would have to agree unequivocally to strike all at once and there could be no dissent within their ranks, which is so unlikely we can basically label it as "impossible" and it's a close enough approximation as to make no difference. If *any* given entity involved in the scheme defected (and it would be in the best interest for each individual to do exactly that) the entire thing would unravel and the main effect would be that the preexisting owners of Bitcoin would be a lot richer as a result of the attempt.


To pull this off at this stage would require lots and lots and lots of ASICs. ASICs have to be built. Building them requires factories. Factories for this purpose are being constructed as I write this. In order to compete (much less trounce) the private sector in this arena, you would have to be able to outproduce everyone else combined, and you would have to do so without the world realizing what you are doing. Otherwise you'll just spur the arms-race even more, and will be just another player mining Bitcoin, which you now have an incentive to preserve and protect because of your stake in the game.
Additionally, someone having 51% of the mining capacity does not automatically ruin Bitcoin. They would be able to pull some undeniably annoying shenanigans, but to be honest, who do you expect the government to victimize with a double-spend attack? If the angle is "sabotage Bitcoin by simply muddying up the blockchain and making other miners give up" I can see that being a problem... but again, this would just cause a prompt exodus to the next-best cryptocurrency and we can play this game all day, since you're playing on *our* turf. 
And when it ultimately comes out that the government(s) are building huge multimillion $ factories solely to sabotage Bitcoin, how do you think the citizens and taxpayers would react? "Good job Uncle Sam, you teach those guys a lesson!"?


This was definitely the scariest and most realistic prospect of the bunch, *up until the Senate hearings in November*. After essentially promising to do **not that** in a publicly-broadcast format, I sleep a lot easier with my money in Bitcoin.
Sure, it's not completely impossible and anything could happen. But they recently said "We'll leave Bitcoin itself alone and go for the criminals who use Bitcoin as a tool of circumventing the law instead." It seems unlikely that one day they'd say "jk lol fuk u get rekt" out of the blue.

They have fucked me over (in the same way as OP) three separate orders now. I've logged multiple support requests (using contact as well as "Email Us a Question" from inside my Coinbase account) and I've been waiting about five days now to hear back from them on it. 
It definitely doesn't look like they're going to "honor it" and I'm not even sure I'll ever get a response, at this point. 
I, also, am just waiting the 30 days (it's actually almost up) before Level II is achieved, but honestly, I've found this company to be much, much less professional, courteous, or honorable as the reviews I'd read seemed to indicate. 
Hoping they come through (in which case I'll update my saga) but it's looking like they do what they can to scam you for that first month while you're forced to be a Level I verified customer. 
--Prices of bitcoins rose while we held on to those bucks for you? Well, nevermind, we're not going to honor that deal we had with you! Got questions why?

So far every investment (still held) in Bitcoin that wasn't made on April 8, 9, or 10th this year has "ended well" for the investor. That's pretty damn "short term" if you ask me... the only way in which it doesn't qualify as "short term" is if your definition of "short term" is synonymous with "the timeframe in which the price ultimately drops after a quick rise."

Once you take a "black-and-white" stance like you seem to have done, you can't fairly assess the information at hand.

Good question, and I agree that it's the kicker. I don't have any more say on the matter than the next fellow, but I'll give my personal answer here, for whatever it's worth.
In no specific order, I'd like to see clear indications of:
* Ubiquitous usage of upper layers of the stack, and a "you know it when you see it" level of technological maturity on this front. Best case scenario, we reach a point where Lightning Network, or something like it, is being used for an appreciable portion (ideally more than half) of all Bitcoin transactions for a sustained period of weeks or months, and all the neat tricks like [submarine swaps, splicing, channel factories, AMP,  etc]( are in full swing and being handled smoothly by the most popular wallet software (hopefully in the background)...
* Transaction batching, coinjoins, and signature aggregation as commonplace as could be reasonably expected...
* Full node counts increasing...
* Quality fee estimation tools and algorithms being used, such that the fee market appears to be functioning in a sane and sustainable way...
* A quality BIP as unburdened by politics and rancor as possible, adequately addressing the various nuances and implications of the proposal itself as well as the network context into which it would be deployed, which receives and withstands substantial peer review by the wider technical community...
* Widespread (almost unanimous) support of the proposal by the Bitcoin community (altcoiners and other parties with notable conflicts of interest can be excluded from consideration as "part of the community" here)...
* Fraud proofs or any sort of significant improvements to the bootstrap process and duration...
* High-quality research into the long-term economics of Bitcoin, its fee markets and mining process, the bandwidth/memory/storage constraints and costs that are relevant to its operation and validation, etc... and review thereof...
* A different compelling reason to hard fork which serves to reframe the question from "Why?" to "Why not?"...
I don't particularly think that *all* of these criteria would need to be satisfied simultaneously, but some "critical mass" of the above would need to be achieved, I think. It's unfortunately not a question that can be answered precisely or definitively, but I think if we saw evidence of significant levels of upper-layer usage, a high-quality BIP championed in a civil and professional way, legitimate indications of widespread community support, and (importantly) no compelling counterarguments against the general idea/approach, then that would be sufficient.

This is still assuming you can convert $ to Mh/s fluidly, though. Checking out [Avalon's store]( shows that the maximum order quantity on their chips is 200,000, and that the lead time for these once they're ordered is 9 to 10 weeks. As the user "Eastwind" from your link points out:


Of course, there are other vendors of ASICs and other factors to consider - perhaps you *could* make a swift gambit and meaningfully disrupt the market with a $20m investment, but I'm still mulling this all over and haven't quite decided what I believe the outcome would be.

That's because the transaction profile of the network is continually evolving. The historical trend towards increased multisig/P2SH usage is the primary factor that has caused SegWit's effective blocksize increase grow from ~0.7 to ~1.1 additional MB in the past two years.
The original estimate (2 years ago) was that blocks would be about 1.7MB in size, on average, on a full-SegWit network. Since then, as P2SH has grown in popularity, the figure has grown to 2.1MB.

I absolutely love reading Satoshi's words. He was so careful. Nary a word out of place, and he doesn't bother wasting his time on frivolities at all. I would also encourage you to pore through the history of "satoshi" on bitcointalk.org where he continued to be an active member for a couple years.
You also picked out 2 of my very favorite quotes of his here. I absolutely love how his answer in the first is "oops, I've already done it" and his comment in the second is self-contradictory; who are you kidding, Nakamoto? You are amazing with words, too.
The other favorite Satoshi moment of mine was when someone on bitcointalk.org asked about whether the Bitcoin protocol could be modified so that the units could be subdivided into smaller than 2 decimal places ("in case it ever gets worth a serious amount") and Satoshi stopped by to say, basically, "it only shows 2 decimal places in the client, but behind the scenes there are actually 8" and the OP was like "Oh, wow, future-proof. Good job." As far as I know, this was the first time that the divisibility was made known outside of the source-code itself... so it was essentially a trick up his sleeve he neglected to mention at first.
It's like "hey what about this?" and Satoshi's answer was always "I already thought of that."

Let me also say that I have a great respect for you (and you're RES-tagged as intelligent and have a glowing green number next to your username). This particular exchange was the least-flattering one I've seen you involved in, to be honest, because you seem to be parroting a "black-and-white" philosophy backed by conspiratorial beliefs (and simultaneously fail to realize that I'm sympathetic to those beliefs)... but I do not think much less of you as a result. I just want you to see things with a bit richer of a perspective; there are Bad Men and they do have A Lot of Power, but they don't control *everything*. 
My personal hypothesis concerning Satoshi's identity is formed almost exclusively from my analysis of his prose. Most of what I've read is from that cryptography mailing list where he debuted Bitcoin. He strikes me as a smart kid (20-something) who had a *really, really great fucking idea* and executed it with masterful precision. He is the Albert Einstein or Kurt Gödel of our age, and I have nothing but respect for the man. 
It's not a rigorous proof, at all, of course, but it's a very powerful impression that I have. I won't lie: I scoff a little every time I read "the organization known as Satoshi Nakamoto". I'd be so proud to be that dude.
If you haven't read the Cryptography mailing list already that I'm referencing, I *highly, highly* recommend it. Satoshi has a way with words.

Why bother with *my* definition of [currency?]( Just Google ["define currency"]( and click [any link]( and you'll have [your answer.]( It's seriously [not that hard.](
I suppose you could try and argue that "it has to be issued by a country to qualify as a currency by *my* definition" if you really wanted to limit the usage of the term to that. But doing so would be tantamount to defining the term so as not to include Bitcoin explicitly. It'd be akin to arguing that a circle is not a "shape" because you define "shape" to be "a finitely-sided polygon." Sure, you'd win your own little straw-man argument, but it would basically be ignoring the more general (and truer) meaning of the term "shape" to take this route.
To be honest, that was a damn good analogy to pull right out of my ass.

Fascinating points. Well said.
As Bitcoin grows, though, it is going to get a lot murkier when transactions are flying every which way. Not only will mixers and other similar methods become more prevalent and used, but the sheer volume of transactions is going to obscure the money trail considerably.
Scripts will surely be written solely for obfuscating the identities behind transactions. If you're going to follow every single bitcent I send anywhere and assign it a 50% probability as still belonging to me, pretty soon you're going to be tangled up in all the transactions I'm *actually* making, and you're going to be following the trail of lots of money that I have nothing to do with any more.
The landscape is definitely going to change. But I think it's more exciting than it is scary; let's see what sort of insight we can glean from the blockchain! It's an opportunity to learn and progress.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:18:26
Satoshi actually said that the minrelay settings were *the very first attempt at mitigating spam in Bitcoin*, well after the blocksize limit was already in place. So you are entirely mistaken that the blocksize limit was intended as a spam-prevention mechanism.
Since you don't even understand why the limit was introduced in the first place (as is obvious from the fact that you're contradicting Satoshi directly), perhaps it would be best if you stopped muddying the discussion with your uninformed and already-debunked speculation... in other words, *lurk more* until you *know more*, and only *then* should you start trying to participate in discussions on the subject (beyond asking questions).

This is an interesting one. Only time will tell, to be honest.
Keep in mind that using Bitcoin does not preclude you from using other currencies, too. There's no mutual exclusivity that needs to be accounted for. Perhaps Bitcoin will never be used by as many people as the dollar is (in fact, it probably will not), but again, we'll have to wait and see. There are a lot of people in the world, and a stateless and relatively frictionless currency has its merits.
In any case, since my initial reply I've thought of a TL;DR for it, so I'll just put it here: **deflation may well be an exacerbator in times of economic crisis, but in no way has it been demonstrated to be an initial causal agent thereof.** Time will tell.

From the [Bitcoin wiki](


This is not a simple suggestion. This is a requirement. Most people when asked to create a secure password, with everything they've heard about creating a password, will still create a password that if used for a brainwallet, will result in the eventual theft of their funds. The simple fact of the matter is that hacking a brainwallet password is a mathematical exercise that requires no internet access, no communication, and leaves no trace, so hackers can collectively try multiple trillions of passwords every second in the privacy of their own homes with the very same equipment they use for mining bitcoins (in the usual sense). Your bank might tell you that a 10 character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols is a strong password, but it is not strong enough to secure a brainwallet. A password that might be strong enough for traditional banking or a social website is typically unacceptable for a brainwallet.
**A brainwallet passphrase, at a minimum, needs to be an entire original sentence that does not appear in any song or literature.** Security is enhanced simply by including some sort of memorable personal information, which doesn't necessarily even have to be secret (e.g. an e-mail address, or phone number). A good brainwallet passphrase will have dozens of characters.
No offense, OP, ~~but you deserved to lose those coins~~. Why on earth would you *use* a brainwallet in the first place, without reading this, much less send over $1500 to it? 
Edit: I was definitely too harsh. You don't *deserve* to lose that much capital at all and I apologize for alleging such. Still... I'm surprised you opted to use a brainwallet without taking into consideration the One Rule of Brainwallets.

Define "the dominant currency" and I'll tell you whether or not I agree. If you're going to define it as "the currency in which loans are denominated" then yeah, sure, you're totally right for that particular definition. If you're going to define it as "the currency which holds value stronger than alternatives" (which of course you will not), I'm going to have to humbly disagree. 
You see, I understand your point. You simply haven't caught on that "dominant currency" is not a scientifically rigorous phrase, and yet you're still using it as if there's an objective fact-of-the-matter that I'm refusing to acknowledge. It's inane.

As has been explained to you already, this is almost certainly due to a concurrent cause. They hit deflation when something goes wrong.

Yes, it's actually a fascinating and much-puzzled-over topic. Forbes recently had an article titled *[How Bitcoin Spread Violates a Fundamental Economic Law]( in fact.
I'd guess they're surviving off of a combination of brand-name and market momentum, at this point. They're probably not in as dire of straits as some seem to suspect (in fact, with a 10-15% spread in price this indicates that the market is about 85-90% confident that Mt.Gox will be fine in the end) and they might just be keeping hush about it as they get everything in order with the regulators and lawsuits. If Bitcoin happens to take off during that time, it's going to legitimize their business and holdings significantly; it'd be smooth sailing for them at that point. Just a matter of time after that before legal matters are sorted. They may just be betting on Bitcoin hitting it big soon, and playing things conservatively for the time being.

This, right here, should cause anyone with a lick of intelligence to categorize it as a centralized shitcoin and treat it as such.

You have a funny definition of the word "fact" - really, the only way that you could say that this was a "fact" in any meaningful sense of the word is if *you* were the head of every single central bank in the world and you had set the policies yourself.
If you're not the head of any central banks (spoiler alert: you're not) then you can't really use the word "fact" here. You don't know why they do what they do. At most, you know what they *say* about why they do what they do. A far cry away from "simply a fact" if you ask me.


...yes, once the crisis hits, things are bad. Everything after that can be construed as a result of the crisis hitting (or rather, the underlying cause of the crisis). 
Sure, the deflationary spiral worsens an already-bad-situation in these times. I'll accept that conclusion and you won't hear a peep of an argument from me about that. 
*I* understand *your* point. Here's the problem: *you* don't understand *mine*. 
*My* point is that deflation itself cannot be objectively pinpointed as the impetus for economic downfall. You can point to it as a contributory culprit in times when downfall is already underway, but we simply have no laboratory experiments where deflation has occurred in a vacuum so you can't start tossing around words like "truth" and "fact" unless you qualify them heavily with contextual inclusions.
With the possible exception of gold (which you must admit has historically survived as a potent form of wealth), *never* has there been an example of a deflationary currency being introduced "into the wild" like Bitcoin has.
By any metric of growth or success, Bitcoin is doing phenomenal. So far, spending within the Bitcoin economy/ecosystem has been *increasing drastically over time*, so your argument that "deflation kills economies" is being empirically discredited before your very eyes. If you'll take a moment to acknowledge my argument here (and not some stripped-down nonsensical paraphrase of one aspect of it) I will continue to discuss this with you, but if your response is going to be "deflation is bad lol you bitcoin fanatics are so dumb" then I'd rather you not bother typing anything up. I've heard that argument, and I've rebutted it. So far you have not returned the favor.

And finally, Bitcoins are **damn interesting**. I don't care what you say, this is some fascinating stuff right here. 
You can argue monetary policy and the history of the dollar (or other traditional currencies) are just as interesting... perhaps that's true. Personally, I can't imagine something neater than Satoshi's legacy.

Ah, fair point. Never thought of it like that. He certainly could have *ties* to those who are in power, which would certainly help influence whether laws constrict it or allow it to flourish. 
It *does* seem like such a background would threaten his anonymity (any secret gets a lot harder to keep, the more people who are involved). But we *are* talking about the Primary Keepers of Secrets here, in the first place.
Also, the nice thing about Bitcoin (and I think you and I can definitely agree on this point) is that:
No matter *who* created it, it has something to offer the world, and those who recognize this and get involved sooner rather than later are going to accumulate wealth as a result.
So regardless of whether it's a global conspiracy or whether it's more like Prometheus bestowing Man with Fire, I think the clever few (you and me and everyone else here) are going to be better off (at least financially) as a result.

Now we are getting somewhere.
So in your view, the "legitimacy" of Bitcoin (as money, or as an article deserving of attention on Wikipedia, or whatever) will only come when it has a solid historical foundation to rest upon.
I can understand that perspective, definitely. I think it's a bit "unfair" to Bitcoin, because it seems to me that it's tantamount to saying "nothing new or young can be legitimate/important" but I'm a bit of a futurist myself, so I'm biased in favor of emerging tech and trends. 
I myself have faith that one day Bitcoin (or its progeny) will become an undeniably important concept in the world within a few years... but we won't know until those years pass. In other words...
We'll see.

Anyone buying Bitcoin as an investment is going to hold out until their Bitcoin is worth something "reasonable" to them. 
If you want to see prices stabilize, we're going to have to saturate the Bitcoin ecosystem with all the demand it's ever going to get. Until then prices will continue to climb as demand increases, because supply is predictable and relatively stable.
If you notice this and decide to buy BTC and sit on it until it reaches a fair market value (hint: $1000 is nowhere close to the ultimate "fair market value" of a bitcoin) and then spend your stash as you see fit, there's nothing wrong with that. That's a rational and intelligent approach to the situation. 
In other words, if you want to see Bitcoin become the "currency of the masses" then you also want to see the price of a bitcoin skyrocket until it hits a ridiculously large figure and finally "settles" - the two outcomes go hand-in-hand. There aren't enough bitcoins to go around if we're only charging a thousand bucks a pop for them, sorry. 
Yes, spend your bitcoins if you want to in the meantime. There's nothing wrong with that and it needs to be done if we're ever going to get from A to B. But *investing in Bitcoin is fine, too*.

I do not believe you understand what the word "conspiracy" means. An anonymous contribution or a secret withheld does not a conspiracy make. 


Good question, but hopefully one that we never have to answer firsthand. There are speculations as to the answer, but I don't claim to be an expert on the matter so my predictions would be moot.


It is not. 
As I've tried to express here (apparently inadequately): my argument is simply that the reins of power are not as constrictive and capable as you seem to be assuming. The horse can buck a bit, and it does. 
Let us boil down the main disagreement we have in this:
You believe Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for a government or organization of great political clout, and that the reason that we are not seeing Big Brother "crack down" on Bitcoin is because they invented it and are behind it.
I believe Satoshi Nakamoto was probably a genius (maybe a couple of geniuses, actually, but I'm inclined to say it was primarily one individual) who came up with a really clever idea that has happened to get off the ground enough for big players to take notice. 
We won't have definitive proof until he/they makes a move (spends the coins or declares their identity). Until then the speculation is certainly fun.
Bitcoin has still not grown into its massive potential. As two well-researched fellows who find the idea fascinating, we naturally want to extrapolate and say "If it keeps growing, isn't it a threat to those in power? Why wouldn't they just *kill* it before it gets the chance to really hurt them?" but matters are **NOT** that simple. First off, very few incumbent authorities have even shown Bitcoin a serious interest (I can assure you the vast majority has not spent the amount of time researching the subject that I have). So earlier when you said "You think you know more about the economy than the Big Boys?" and called me foolish, I must respond: "No, but I bet I know a lot more about Bitcoin than they do." Perhaps in a year that will not hold true. Perhaps it doesn't even now. 
Bitcoin's certainly "on their radar" now, but to bestow them prematurely with the honor of being its creators is silly. We should hopefully have real answers concerning Satoshi one day. Until then, I believe in the (much more aesthetically-appealing) story that he was a genius who bestowed Man with a gift.

Perhaps that's your reason. You can't confidently assume what everyone else's reason for believing in the future of Bitcoin is.

Also, to address this point specifically...
No, I'm saying that for every $1 invested into Bitcoins *before* the masses catch on, you will net $x in return from the "laggards" who did not realize what an opportunity this is until it was fairly priced. The "$x" could be $10, but I'm betting it will be a lot higher than that.

This is flatly untrue. What has come of it is a client-side hosts-file quickfix, an admission from the manufacturer themselves (and a firmware patch that allegedly solves the problem -- though of course less conclusively than the hosts-file fix), public awareness of the issue, and accompanying sentiment.
Honestly, the AntBleed exposure has been as successful as you could reasonably expect it to be. Major losses didn't occur *precisely because* some people went out of their way to shine a light on the issue. They deserve our heartfelt gratitude.

It *can* be viewed in a conspiratorial light, sure...
But I think we're just seeing the infamous Lag of Beaurocracy at its finest.
Additionally, the very nature of Bitcoin is designed so that fighting it is immeasurably more difficult (**less profitable**) than participating in it. If the Illuminati are actually as efficient as the tinfoils make them out to be, sure, they're either scheming against Bitcoin or are behind it... but it's a lot easier to envision that the world is made up of individual agents who are a lot less coordinated and capable than the doomsayers make out, and thus far they've seen Bitcoin as "cute and frivolous," "a pipe dream," "a Ponzi scheme," etc etc. 
As the merit of Bitcoin continues to distinguish itself in the worldstage, these individual agents (or at least a portion of them) will inevitably "jump on board" and then it'd be significantly more difficult to coordinatedly quell the revolution.

Where on earth did you get that silly notion? *Of course* Bitcoin is an investment! Personally I think it's one of the best ones you can make.
It will remain so until the technology is widely adopted and the demand has already saturated the market. Once adoption starts to slow down, we can revisit the question "Is it or is it not an investment?" but until then, you're deluding yourself if you think otherwise. Perhaps you don't think it's a *good* investment or a *smart* investment, but an investment it most certainly is.

Great post, my friend. I have one thing I want to mention...


I *do* dimly detect a danger down this road, though. 
Hypothetically, let's say some supergovernment says "Alright everyone, we'll redeem CoinValidation-validated Bitcoins for $x apiece." In effect, they'd destroy fungibility of Bitcoins in one fell swoop, because now Joe Schmo feels fine buying Validated Coins ("it's backed by the guvmint!") but won't accept your Bitcoins. It's a "sideways" attack on the Bitcoin network, by actually *using* Bitcoin itself as the protocol of choice, but massively ostracizing the Early Adopters' coins with a new layer of sophistication* on top of it.

My point is not "You're stupid if you haven't bought Bitcoin."
It's something a little more like: "You're either stupid or lazy if you have had the advantages of Bitcoin explained to you and you write it off as a scam and never bother to entertain the possibility that it *does* have potential. You're petty and base if you try to gloat when the price per Bitcoin falters and you think its because the 'ponzi scheme is inevitably collapsing' or 'the bubble is finally popping'. You're a lying fool if you proclaim to know what will happen in this exciting new arena, and yet haven't actually made any money from doing so. If you purport to be an expert on a topic and you make statements or actions concerning it, and then your beliefs are contradicted before your very eyes, but you maintain your prior position and choose to ignore the data and the arguments of the opposing viewpoint, you are not a smart human."

Your bank is charging you for all those services, though. You don't realize this consciously most of the time, of course, because it is the job of the bank to make sure you don't realize what you're paying them.
It is my personal theory that Bitcoin, by outsourcing the "trouble" of transaction verification and monetary inflation to the network itself, is helping to spread the profits that have traditionally been monopolized by banks to the community much more directly. In an abstract way, I believe it returns the Wealth of Man to the 99%.
My only evidence of this so far (aside from the logic that led me to this conclusion itself) is the fact that all reasonable participants of the Bitcoin ecosystem have profited considerably from their involvement so far. 
Will this always hold true? Perhaps not. But one can hope.

All it would take is a government accepting CoinValidated coins for taxes, and/or proscribing the usage of non-Validated coins.
For what reason would they do something like this? Well, if it reaches a certain level of *obviousness* that the dollar is plummeting, perhaps they'll try to "get in" on the crypto game. But only if they can still sway the rules.

If you want "easy, safe" and you don't necessarily want "anonymous" then Coinbase is perfect for you. 
Localbitcoins is going to cost you a 10-20% premium on the Coinbase prices, so Coinbase is better if you want cheap coins, too. 
And you can certainly always mix or wash your coins if you want to detach your personal info from your Bitcoin stash. So I don't really understand why you're saying "Do NOT use coinbase" unless you're planning on heading straight to the Silk Road after you get your BTC.

Yes, you are absolutely right; such functionality will require a third party. It is also not unfair to compare such a third party to a bank in some respects. 
The thing to realize is that Bitcoin allows for things that banks (and our existing financial ecosystem) do not, and it *also* allows for the same things that have been going on already (like reversible payments) and it just so happens to lower fees across the board. 
It does away with the need to "credit check" someone (requiring sensitive personal information and costly research into their financial status) who is trying to offer capital for some service or exchange. Now you can just check the blockchain and if they're good for it, it will show. 
In other words, we sacrifice nothing of what we used to have, but we gain a lot of stuff that we didn't.
Bitcoin is a superior protocol for the transmission of value, no question about it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:35:29
Yeah man, it's not like Bitcoin just went fully international with China eclipsing Western demand entirely, the United States government declared that they want it to grow and prosper and consider it an opportunity rather than a threat, merchant adoption and integration surged significantly forward, the general sentiment of the press and public shifted towards more positive and hopeful tones than ever before, and new records and headlines have been earned steadily.
And of course there has been no consolidation or corrections on the price during that time (signaling strength and stability and a continued general faith in the rise).
Yeah, it's totally doomed. Nothing but hype. We're definitely headed to $0.05 bitcoins by December, so place your Bid orders now for that crash that will definitely be here in like 5 minutes.

Bitcoin wallets *can* be vastly more secure than any other property you own. You could theoretically generate a brain-wallet and it would have to be *tortured* out of you before your Bitcoins were compromised.


You can literally send Bitcoins [via email]( If you gave me your email address right now, I could send you $10 in Bitcoin within 2 minutes. You don't even have to want to receive them - they'd be yours as soon as I wanted them to. It's not even so much as they can be sent "like" email, they can be sent *as* email. 


May I cite the [Bitcoin wiki]( here and say "At the moment, many transactions are typically processed in a way where no fee is expected at all, but for transactions which draw coins from many bitcoin addresses and therefore have a large data size, a small transaction fee is usually expected."

Technically once that address has been used to send bitcoins anywhere it "reveals" its public key in a way that makes it vulnerable to a quantum attack a la Shor's algorithm. 
It's a stretch, admittedly, but "good practice" in Bitcoin is to only use an address for receiving bitcoins, and when you use it to spend, spend *all* its inputs and move the remainder to a new, un-used address.

It looks like you skimmed my initial post without actually taking the time to consider the point I was making, decided to quibble over semantics instead of focusing on the point I was making, and have since had your ego wounded while I dance circles around you with my rhetoric. 
I'll take this time here to repeat a few things that you may have missed on your first read-through:


Notice the "dimly"? You see how I was conveying the idea that this is a remote possibility?


Notice the "hypothetically"? See how I wasn't saying "this is how it is going to happen"? That's important to note.


Notice the constant-reminders I've been outputting that this is not something I consider likely? Are you starting to see how foolish you've made yourself look?
Now, by contrast, let's see what *you've* been saying:


The dollar itself is what you'd be redeeming it for. Of course you would get a "funny look" because you'd be saying "Here's my legal tender, can you give me legal tender for this?"
This is not the same as saying "Here's my [x]. Can you give me legal tender for this?" In this specific instance, [x] is Bitcoins (or, more specifically, CoinValidated Bitcoins). 
Your hypothetical scenario is patently absurd, and you should feel bad.


Getting a bit ahead of yourself there, sport.


You went from arguing semantics to prematurely declaring victory to "your mom" jokes in 3 replies. Now all you have to do is invoke Godwin's Law!

I absolutely hear where you're coming from, too. 
My first buy through them was flagged as "high-risk" and ended up costing me a good chunk when the price rose from $90 to $120 or so. I was *pissed* and probably sent them 15 emails full of vitriol. For a couple of weeks, I **hated** Coinbase.
In the end, they honored the buy and whitelisted my account, and since then I've always felt a kinship for the company, so I occasionally try to defend them when they're getting bashed on.
They're not perfect, but at least relatively speaking, they're one of the more reliable pillars in the Bitcoin industry.

You have a funny, nonstandard definition of the word "legitimacy" there.
I'm just a bit confused why you think I'm arguing that Bitcoin needs to be treated equivalently to the USD or some other government-issued currency. I never said that. 
From your perspective, any stocks in a company are "funbux," too. 
*Gold* might even qualify as "funbux" with your definition, because how many people use gold as money? It may even be less than the number that use Bitcoin. 
Your definitions are too rigid to be meaningful. I know you think it was clever to edit your "Monopoly money" hyperbole into a "gift card" one, but unfortunately it didn't make your stance seem any less ridiculous. 
Bitcoin is a commodity. I'm not arguing that the majority of people use it for transactions yet, so don't worry about convincing me that it's "still just a niche thing used by a tiny minority" because that's a waste of both of our time. My one and only stance here is that it is a naive perspective indeed which asserts:

How do you not see this? Your Bitcoins appreciating in value will not make you stop spending money altogether. You just won't spend it as willy-nilly anymore (at least, not until you're rich).


No no no no no no. Money will still be spent. People still want things. You are assuming that we won't spend our money because we make more money? That's actually beyond stupid. A child could see that this makes no sense.
You want to eat? That'll cost you. Want a car? Spend money. Want a house? Rent due? Want to get the girlfriend a ring? *You will have to spend your Bitcoins when you have demand for a product or a service.* You save the rest. It's that simple.

Any time the price is rising, it's increasing the incentive for new investors to get involved.

You can't say "this is simply a fact" unless it can be rigorously proven. If you can rigorously prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, you've earned the right to say "this is a fact" - I would love to see you try. But without being the one who made the decisions, you will ultimately fail. Go for it, if you think it can be proven, do it rigorously. Otherwise it's a conjecture. Perhaps a reasonable one, but a conjecture nonetheless.

You still don't seem to see the problem. It's your step 3:


The "high priced exchange" is almost always Gox. You can't "put the money in your bank account" from Gox. It's effectively impossible to withdraw fiat from Gox in less than a month.
The arbitrage doesn't work, because Gox withdrawals don't work. You don't have to reason it out any further. That's the problem and that's why the price discrepancy persists.
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:34:26
Congrats on that.
All I know is I've made about 8 transactions so far, and the 3 that went through *happened* to be during times when the price was stabilized over that week. The other 5 would have made me tidy little profits, but Coinbase conveniently decided *those* were higher-risk than the others.
From my perspective, it seems pretty skewed. Obviously this is one data point, but judging from the complaints in this subreddit, I'm not alone...

Hello, friend. 
I'm very interested in learning more along these lines (Bitcoin has sparked an avid interest in cryptography for me). If you have the time and know the answers, would you mind explaining this in a bit more detail?
As I understand it so far, initially when Bitcoins are sent to a particular address, they are safe from cryptoanalytic attacks because neither the public key nor the private key have been exposed to the world. Once this address is used to initiate and sign a transaction itself (in other words, once any Bitcoins in that wallet are spent in any way) the public key is necessarily exposed to the world in a way that it had previously not been. 
Am I right so far?
This exposure of the public key of an address then means that someone exploiting Shor's technique could theoretically derive the private key (and thus spend the remaining balance of that wallet/address themselves)? This surprises me greatly, most of all because I've only ever seen it mentioned in the comments on Reddit (namely, here).
I realize that Shor's algorithm is a quantum-computing approach (and thus it's probably a safe assumption that no one out there is currently maliciously harvesting Bitcoins with this technique) so that's somewhat reassuring... it's also reassuring that so far in deriving prime factors with this method:


... but most of my daydreams concerning Bitcoin are long-term and far-future; I don't believe in taking for granted things like "quantum attacks aren't something to worry about." 
Another question: the Big O of a Shor-approach looks to be


What would that mean in regards to ECDSA? Are we talking, "A million-dollar quantum computer could find your private key with a century's worth of brute-force attempts"? I wish I knew how to phrase this question a bit more intelligently, but I guess what I'm asking is, "Can this be dumbed down just a tiny bit so I can comprehend it?"
If, indeed, using an address to send any coins anywhere creates an opportunity for malicious actors to steal the rest, that means that any company accepting Bitcoins cannot safely maintain a single "RECIPIENT" address which they then forward to sub-wallets or accounts (which I had hitherto assumed would be a possibility). 
The more I think about it, the more inconvenient and bothersome the implications of this revelation seem to be. This means that any transaction I do with Bitcoin at all requires me to generate one more address (or public/private key-pair) to forward my remaining balance to, assuming I want my coins as safe as possible... is that right? So setting up a button for a "Donations" address on a web-page would only be useful until you wanted to *use* any of its accumulated balance, at which point the button's address needs updating. 
I had read about the Bitcoin-QT client generating 100 key-pairs by default for a given wallet, but if Bitcoin starts getting used seriously, it sounds like any reasonably-active consumer would go through those in a couple of weeks with their transactions. Is the response to this observation just "Yeah, so what? You can generate another batch of 100 at that point"? 
If you have any particular resources that would help me develop as a cryptographer, please point me in that direction. I pore over Wikipedia and the Bitcoin wiki on a daily basis, but my comprehension-level varies drastically from page to page and I have yet to develop a proper "method" of learning this stuff.

A lot of people have trouble fathoming how Bitcoin can continue doing so well because they try to break it down and apply **one** label to it.
Bitcoin is not just a currency, and it's not just a store of value. 
It's difficult to appreciate how much Bitcoin is capable of being, because up until it came along, there has never been *anything* like it.  For instance, gold works well as a store of value, but not as a currency. Fiat currencies are the opposite. Because we've never had a technology that taps into the "best of both worlds" we've subconsciously grown used to thinking they're mutually exclusive, that there is some fundamental incompatibility between the two.
As it turns out, there's probably not. We'll have to wait and see how things play out, of course, but so far the outlook is promising, to say the least.

Deflation is not what is driving Bitcoin's price up. I can see why you might be confused on this point, though.
What increases the price per Bitcoin is the fundamental scarcity of Bitcoins combined with increased adoption/demand. Where supply meets demand is where the price of a Bitcoin lay. When you see the price go up, what you are really seeing is the demand for Bitcoins increasing.
Bitcoin is an inflationary currency, and will be so for more than a century. That is what mining does: creates more Bitcoins!

Go ahead and double-verify your account and add a VISA card. You can buy your coins and get them instantly. So Coinbase is fine.
The *only* reason this "high-risk" thing is a problem is that the existing systems of payment are slow and reversible. ACH transfers take days (and in some cases weeks) and you're demanding that Coinbase give you the coins before they receive the money from you (and without knowing whether you are going to scam them beforehand). That's unreasonable to request.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:32:45
Yes, I read that comment. Did you?


If you have Bitcoin in your Coinbase account already (which of course everyone involved in this hypothetical would) then you can use the existing stash in your account to buy the gyft card and just replenish that amount (even if it takes 4 days).
1-3 weeks, regardless, is hyperbole. It's like you're trying to create a fault where none exists.

It's very easy to determine a percentage. In this case, the percentage is 12%. You ignoring the fact that this is the percent fee you're paying to transmit money doesn't change the fact that that's the exact percent fee you're paying to transmit money. 
 


It does. It's called Bitcoin. It's working right now. You can transfer millions of dollars of value and pay less than 10 cents in fees to do so. It's not a daydream. It's happening right now, every day.


You've never transmitted bitcoins, if you believe this. It takes 10 minutes to an hour (depending on how paranoid you feel like being) in 99% of cases. It almost *never* costs more than 1% unless you're transmitting a very very small value.
You need to do some research.

Isn't a strong counterpoint the very-evident cycle of "bubbles" in Bitcoin's history, wherein *every time* the price stabilized significantly above where it had been prior to the spike? Why was the $10-$240-$100 bubble "special" in any way? It looks to me like the pattern does what the pattern does... sure, we can posit explanations as to *why* it stabilized at X instead of Y, but that's basically just guesswork.

Bitcoin *is* successful. And it will continue to grow until there is a legitimate reason for it not to. So far, no such reason has surfaced.
You don't have a choice what you "pay" the early adopters, because you don't control the market, silly. You're just one dude. If you don't want to give Satoshi or whoever the going-rate for their bitcoins, you don't have to. But someone else will, so have fun standing on the sidelines.


Good luck on that. Since Facebook's privacy controls are shit, why not just implement an identical platform with different settings controls?
Network effect, my friend. The Bitcoin network is secured by the computational power of all miners involved. If you can find a more equitable protocol, by all means develop and release it and hope for the best... but good luck getting anyone to adopt it, when adopting Bitcoins means personal profit while adopting your EqualCoins means socialistic redistribution of wealth.


For one, this is speculation. I've already read the articles you've read, so don't think you have an informational advantage on this. It's not clear how many coins Satoshi owns. 
I'm not going to deny that he *probably does* have close to that amount, though. Which brings me to my next point...
He hasn't spent any of them. 
Just think on that for a while.


It already *is* flying just fine as a global currency. China's adoption is looking viral. Germany has declared it private money. America shows no signs of slowing down their Bitcoin usage. Buttercoin and co. are working to address the remittances market with this tool, and are probably going to have some great news for us soon. 
Like it or not, Bitcoin is a beautiful and elegant system that has demonstrated in practice its resiliency. You don't have to participate, but you can't stop its momentum, either.

Where on Earth did you get the idea that Blockstream has no stake in the scaling debate? 
Blockstream is made up of people who both love and understand Bitcoin, and who want it to flourish. Just like you or I, these people have opinions on how it should scale.
Samson Mow and Adam Back are both smart guys who have very well-informed opinions on Bitcoin. Why would you expect them to be quiet about what they believe in?
Really, the best thing about Blockstream is that they help to set up a sort of "litmus test" in the wild. Pretty much anyone who is peddling a Blockstream-oriented conspiracy theory immediately exposes that they aren't being honest, genuine, or intelligent. Their hand is exposed to those of us who are paying attention.

You're right. My mental radar is all warped by Bitcoin-time. I guess it's only been a subjective week.




Wrong. The other question is: "When?"




I can think of 1.351 billion reasons: China. 


I fully have. I'm just not convinced that going from $120 to $220 is where the first dramatic correction of this impending rise (which I fully expect is on its way before Christmas hits) is going to take place. I'm probably going to be cashing *in* a bit more in the next couple of days; funds were locked up or else I'd have been in last Friday. Call me crazy, but I think we're going to see some juiciness *very* soon, and so far in the past few days the markets (and the articles they've spawned) agree.


Of course. Hopefully this isn't the last real bubble, either... though one might think the public would finally get it after this one.
Fun times, fun times.
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:53:07
Fantastic post. I want to chime in on a couple of points real quick.


Bitcoin *does* enable things that are impossible in other systems, like trustless escrow or hypothetical autonomous agents. Sure, right now these are basically just neat ideas and we haven't seen most of the potential get properly harnessed yet... but Bitcoin *does* open up new possibilities. It's surprising that you're not at least a little excited by that.
Also, it's hardly fair to say something that averages more than 1000% return every single year "sucks"... In all honesty, Bitcoin has been the best investment there is ever since it came around. Whether or not you recognize anything special about it doesn't change the fact that some people obviously do find value in it, or else it wouldn't be growing so damn impressively.


Ah, not quite.

"might as well be dead tech" is a bit much, but your point still stands.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:31:34
Ok, fair.
But if demand is growing gradually and steadily, rather than in the drastic spurts that it's been doing while Bitcoin is so young, the price increases shouldn't be so dramatic. So the price deflation wouldn't be so much of a worry at that point.
Also, at a certain point it should be a lot easier for speculators and investors to derive actual methods for predicting demand increases and other market analytics. At that point, the equilibrium price for a Bitcoin should be a lot more straightforward to calculate and agree upon than it is right now. Once we have some serious expectations set into place on an aggregate level, the "future demand" should begin to be priced in more accurately.

Irrelevant for all Bitcoin transactions which are not "cashing in" or "cashing out" at an exchange.

"Base ten" =/= "Base 10"
The phrase "base 10" can mean anything, because you're using digits to represent the value of the base. You have to use a word like "ten" to specify that you mean the standard definition of "base 10" like how you are using it.
To demonstrate...
Let us use base three-hundred-and-ninety-million, nine-hundred-twenty-eight-thousand, seven-hundred-eighty-seven as our numeral system.
The Bitcoin difficulty is now 10 in this base. Clearly in "base ten" it is not "10" but in our arbitrarily-defined-numeral-system it is indeed represented as the digits "one zero" or "10"

And yet Bitcoin does it for cheaper.
You can postulate "Maybe one day Bitcoin transactions will be more expensive than 'traditional' ones!" but there's no reason to believe this will occur. Bitcoin makes this a competitive process. The fact of the matter is that it's cheaper. That's the truth. For merchants (especially small businesses with relatively-small transaction sizes) this is an unignorable advantage.
It's **inherently advantageous** about Bitcoin because *look*, it's happening right now. You can send five million dollars for a fee of a nickel.
"Maybe one day the credit card companies and banks can work something out that achieves these sorts of fees!"
Bitcoin already has. It's working, right now. In practice. Every day that goes by makes it that much more obvious. Perhaps decades in the future the fees in the Bitcoin protocol will prove to be suboptimal and something better will come lumbering along. We can only hope this *does* happen! Until then, just take a look around and see how everything's performing. Bitcoin has virtually 0 fees. Everything else has $0.2+&gt;1%. This is reality.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:47:37
I can assure you, neither of you know what the concept of Karma is. You call it imaginary, but without even understanding the fundamentals of the definition of the concept, your assessment of how "imaginary" it is or is not means little to nothing. 
To understand what Karma is actually supposed to represent, forget about the colloquial concept of "what goes around comes around" because it will just confuse you. 
A much more meaningful interpretation can be summarized like so:


In other words, Karma is what you get when you identify the Self as the Universe. If I punch you, I don't have to worry about the Universe one day punching *me* (although practically speaking, maybe I should, because you're going to want revenge)... rather, the damage is done to the Universe with the initial punch. The pain has been dealt to the Universe, which I am a tendril of. By hurting, I hurt.
This is not "imaginary" any more than saying a particular painting is beautiful is an "imaginary" opinion. You may not feel this way, because your perspective may not directly coincide with those who *do* believe in Karma (the **real** definition of Karma, not the bastardized colloquial nonsense), but that does not invalidate the converse perspective at all. The Universe *can* be seen as One, and there is nothing more "imaginary" about this than saying that we can be seen as separate and distinct individuals.

Bitpay is a subscription service. You'd have to go to their website directly for the exact rates, but it's quite affordable. So, basically, if you're subscribed to a Bitpay plan and someone buys from you with btc, you don't pay ANY fees. Your "fee" is the cost of the subscription in the first place.
With PayPal and other online CC or e-check services, fees range from 1%-4% plus a small flat-rate usually and in rare instances can be significantly higher.
This, in my opinion, is one of the biggest selling points and benefits of Bitcoin.

Ah yes, the old "if you hoard it you are a bad person and it will die" argument. 
Saving an asset that you expect to appreciate in value tremendously for a later date when it has reached a more reasonable price is not "hoarding" and Bitcoin is not going to die if people keep buying it and saving it because they think it is currently undervalued. Please stop trying to pretend otherwise. It is dumb.

The way Bitcoins are generated is by a lottery, basically. How else can you do it fairly in a decentralized system?
A block is a chunk of Bitcoins generated every ten minutes. The "winner of the lottery" (who in actuality had a highly-specialized computer happen to hash the "lottery-winning" byte in that ten minutes) gets the "prize" AKA the block. Currently this is 25 Bitcoins per block. It is designed to decrease over time (thus eventually capping out the total number of Bitcoins produced).
To "buy a lottery ticket" in this analogy is to dedicate a specific computer (in today's age, "ASIC" miners which are super-efficient-Bitcoin-mining-chips) to "hashing" a bunch of random guesses at the winning string. Cumulatively, this means that all miners everywhere are trying to dedicate more processing power towards winning these Bitcoin block rewards, and in the process of doing so they just so happen to ensure all the transactions that everyday users and spenders of Bitcoin want to be sent, eventually do get sent, for relatively tiny transaction fees. 
You really don't have to worry too much about the mining world in Bitcoin in order to be able to *use* Bitcoin as a tool for spending money online or even investing. I'd recommend doing so (more because it's fascinating than anything else) but it's more like "really interesting background processes" than anything else.

Despite the condescension thickly strewn throughout your comment, you make a good argument.
However, it's still ultimately a subjective classification. From your Investopedia speculating vs investing article:


This is why I buy bitcoins... because I have analyzed the relevant factors and reached a conclusion that Bitcoin is fundamentally superior to other payment-processing networks. 
Bitcoin day-traders may be speculating, but people who buy and hold long-term as a result of their analysis may just as well be classified as "investors."
To help you understand a little better, consider the following:
If you were to read Western Union's business statement, do a little market research, and decide to buy a few shares of Western Union stock, you would be *investing* in Western Union. From your own quote: "investments include the purchase of bonds, **stocks** or real estate property."
Do you follow so far?
Now, Western Union is a company. It provides a service (namely, to aid in the transfer of wealth from one location to another). The company does not "produce" anything; they own no factories and make no widgets. Their profits (and stock price) are entirely based on the revenues generated by the financial service they provide.
Bitcoin can be thought of as a distributed company, and bitcoins themselves can be thought of as virtually-infinitely-divisible shares in that company. Bitcoin provides the *exact same service* as Western Union, too, so you really can't pretend like the comparison is irrelevant. Everything Western Union does, Bitcoin does better. So if I, with my Western Union shares, decided to liquidate my holdings and convert them into "Bitcoin stock" (i.e. bitcoins) would my portfolio suddenly change from an "investment" to a "speculation"? Obviously you believe so. I am not willing to admit such just yet.
Sure, you can say that acquiring bitcoins is "speculating" and you won't get an argument from me. If you say conclusively that it's "not investing," though, I really think your opinion on the matter is too simplistic.

Alright. I'll feed the troll, just this once. Then I'm out, kid.


Click a link. I provided 4. Here's a few of the relevant definitions from those links: "something that is used as a medium of exchange; money"; "the fact or quality of being widely accepted and circulated from person to person"; "Money in any form when in actual use as a medium of exchange, especially circulating paper money"; "Transmission from person to person as a medium of exchange; circulation"; "A currency (from Middle English curraunt, meaning in circulation) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation, as a medium of exchange, especially circulating paper money... A much more general use of the word currency is anything that is used in any circumstances, as a medium of exchange. In this use, 'currency' is a synonym for the concept of money."
Literally any one of the above definitions (and those were just scrapped together from the links I provided) works perfectly here, and reinforces my point. 


Not unless those are being used in some system of exchange that I have been unaware of. So, my answer at the moment is "no" unless there's some black market that uses Coca Cola as a unit with which to buy other goods. I have yet to see anything be bought for in "Coca Cola cans," you utter fool. Perhaps you're confusing the words "commodity" and "currency"? 
Once again, I'm shaking my head here. This will be my last response to your trolling unless you put forth some sort of coherent counter-argument or make a real point. If you have been serious this whole time, then I invite you to take a step back and assess yourself as a person.

I have researched this (independently but intensely) and I would say I am as "sure" of this as I am of any other strongly-held conviction of mine.
It does indeed seem to be true that quantum-entangled particles can allow two remote observers to become aware of a bit of information simultaneously. What it does *not* allow is for one of those two observers to manipulate **what the information actually is**. So yes, you could open your box, peer inside, and know with certainty a particular aspect of the particle that Alice over in Andromeda would be able to observe by opening her own box... But you couldn't send her a message with this method. 
What you *could* do is tell Alice beforehand: "If your particle has a positive spin when you check it, then kill Fred" and then when you determine that her particle does indeed have a positive spin then you can safely make the assumption that Alice is probably murdering Fred right now... But you didn't communicate faster than light in this scenario, and you have no way of knowing with certainty whether Alice actually is going to kill Fred (regardless of what properties her particle has).
If you'd like to know more about how the Lorentz frames come into play and prohibit faster-than-light communication, I may be able to dig up a webpage or two for further reading.

I have no obligation to Wikipedia to donate anything. The fact that it's called a "donation" and not a "subscription" is a testament to that fact.
If I needed to know about a particular subject, I could use Google for my research. There are free alternatives to Wikipedia for knowledge, so even though I have used (and will continue to use) the service while it is available to me, I find it annoying when they plaster Jimmy Wales all over the site and basically beg me for money on my visits. I find Wikipedia ads much more annoying than regular ads, because I (and my software) filter regular ads from reaching my conscious perception, but Wikipedia ads manage to actually cross that threshold. 
I've toyed with the idea of donating to them, but that would be like rewarding a dog with a treat right after it did something naughty. Sends the wrong signal and all.
If they start accepting Bitcoins, I will send them a donation forthwith. The message this sends would be more palatable to me; even though it encourages their pleading on one hand, it would reflect support for Bitcoin and pad its stats in a way that I agree with.
To try and salvage your analogy (and then respond appropriately), I'll put it this way: if Target started accepting Bitcoin, I would indeed stop shopping at Walmart and do the bulk of my shopping at Target as a direct result. In this scenario, my answer to your question is a resounding **yes**.

You don't have to cash out your entire stash at the peak, you know. There are other ways to "time" markets.
Saying "You'd have to be a fool to try to maximize your gains during times of volatility!" is beyond silly. Plenty of people try and succeed at beating the numbers during times like these. I am one. 
Have I sold yet? No, because I think we still have plenty of momentum. 
Will I sell the entirety of my Bitcoin stash? Never.
Will I take some profits when we hit $2k price tags? Absolutely. With a little under a third of my total portfolio, if you're interested in the specifics. 
I'll probably take out another 5-10% at $3k, if we hit it. And depending on how things look from there, I'll re-gauge everything and figure out what I'm doing with the remainder. 
I'll be waiting at (what I hope is) the bottom when Bitcoin re-stabilizes, too, to gobble up all the discounted coins while they're available. 
If you go through my post history (especially in I have successfully predicted very specific aspects of the markets in the past few months.

In my opinion, that would just cause a much more gradual (less dramatic and sudden) change in price, and would primarily only be affecting Chinese exchanges.
It's hard to imagine what would happen if this *wasn't* the case, because I think the feedback loop is sort of an inevitable consequence in our global economy of a sudden increase in the demand from a new region. Until now with Bitcoin, this hasn't happened on a large scale.
Basically, if demand goes up somewhere else, the local investors are going to take notice and try to "factor it in" to their mental estimates. So they would, perhaps subconsciously, begin trading at a higher price as a result. The same phenomenon (looking across the ocean and seeing that the price is rising in the other exchanges) would inspire confidence in China, and encourage more money inflow. Loop established.

Whoa whoa whoa, slow down.


What hypothesis do you mean? The hypothesis that Bitcoin is *not* created by the banking cartels and Illuminati?


Do not presume I have not done my research here, my brother. 


Whew, glad I never said anything like that! 




Perhaps. At least in the US and wherever else they can bully efficiently. 
As has been proclaimed time and time again, though, "kill" Bitcoin and what's to stop an alternative cryptocurrency from arising to fill that lucrative niche? You want to ban *all* cryptocurrency, in that case? Explain to me again how nice-and-neat your money-laundering laws apply to this scenario. (Hint: they don't. Not easily, at least, and not without long passages of time as the courts file through the documents they have to).


Fortunately I never said that either! Every time you call me "foolish" or "naive" it turns out you're actually shadowboxing a strawman. 


Perhaps because "they" aren't as all-powerful as you make out.


So China is 100% devoid of black markets and crime? Wow, that's news to me. 


Define "gone", my friend. "Gone" =/= "illegal" and as a psychonaut, you should know better than to assume as much.
Look, before you get *really* angry here, let me tell you that I'm on your side with most of the stuff that I dub "tinfoil-y" because I understand that the undeserving elite in the world really do have a sickening hold on the politics of our age. As much as I wish I were as apolitical as I was in the carefree days of my youth, I've grown older and more jaded, and over time I've come to realize that the conspiracy-nutters have been right, all along. Talk about a windfall of corroboration in the past couple of years (Occupy Wall St, Assange, Snowden, etc)... 
But *you*, sir, are the one being willfully ignorant if you're going to ignore the fact that matters are complex, and the cogs of the Great Machinery that runs our farce-of-a-government turn vvveeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyy slowly and have their own internal conflicts and hiccups along the way. 
The Illuminati are *not* all-powerful (at least not yet) because we're still having this conversation on reddit, are we not? Are you going to allege "It's all just part of the misdirection!" ad nauseum? Is it turtles all the way down to you (except instead of turtles, Gray Men or Reptilians or Rothschilds or Kochs)?
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:46:29
Right now, the fees are optional (if you're sending more than 0.1 BTC... if you're sending less, you may have to include a 0.005BTC fee for it to be considered a legitimate transaction rather than "dust" or "spam"). So right now it's cheap/free because miners are still getting healthy block rewards every 10 minutes.
Miners have no incentive *not* to include as many transactions as they can on the blocks they mine, so they (by default) should just accept all valid transactions that they "see" - the only reason to choose one transaction over another is if you only have enough room on the block for one of them, and one includes a miner fee while the other does not. In other words, fees are a way to prioritize your transactions over other legitimate transactions waiting to be included in a block.
The reason why this is cheap (relative to other systems used in today's online world of commerce) is because you no longer have to worry about running a credit check or verifying the purchase history of anyone sending you a Bitcoin; you can just check the blockchain and confirm that the payment was received. *This* is the beauty of Bitcoin: it actually manages to do away with the middlemen in transactions. No credit checks necessary means we no longer need big banking institutions keeping track of people's purchasing history in order to make sure they're "good for the money" when they try to buy something online. No single entity controls the transactions, so they cannot take advantage of their lopsided power. Instead it's a cumulative (distributed) effort which is performed by the miners.
Removing the need for credit-history-investigations while still providing a mechanism for validating transactions in a public ledger is going to revolutionize payment processing. The fees are going to be as low as they possibly can afford to be (because it's a competitive environment) and we're going to do away with the status quo of $0.20 + 1-3% that credit cards require in order to function.

Your argument is somewhat regressive here.
What makes a constitution any different than a Terms of Service agreement? 
Really, the only distinction I can see is that the constitution is mandatorily applied to all persons who happen to be born in that geographic location, whereas a ToS is only applicable should one willingly engage in business with the entity from which it is provided.
It's *entirely* arbitrary to say "Oh, no constitution? Then you are subject to an entirely different system of judgment/appraisal!"

Looks like you may have skimmed a crucial part of my post there, pal.


Keeping an internal database of who bought which Bitcoin from you can only go so far. Did you read the Satoshi quote you embedded in your comment? His entire point was that Bitcoin was built with privacy considerations in mind; since all addresses are pseudonymous and cost nothing to generate, even if you "remember" which coin was originally mine, I can bounce it around myself if I want to throw you off the trail. Or use a mixing service.

Just so's you know, you can always just get a fraction of a bitcoin. You could set aside $20 and sit on a tenth of a coin.
It may never go as low as you want it to, and it'd be a pity to never have tested it out early on if it *does* skyrocket.

@_date: 2013-12-27 12:13:59


No, no, no. Electricity/equipment are **entirely irrelevant** because we are talking about the fee paid by the consumer for the payment to be processed. What goes on behind-the-scenes, i.e. what makes up the fee, has **no** bearing here. It quite simply does not and should not factor in, because those miners are going to mine regardless of whether you send your payment or not. All that matters to *you*, the end-user, is what you end up forking over when you send your payment to have it processed successfully and reliably.


No, that 20¢ figure was just a random number made up by a redditor in a hypothetical scenario where things had *already gotten worse in Bitcoin*. It is not representative of the current reality. 


Not sure if this is true, but perhaps it is. If they can do it, great. But personally when it comes to efficiency my bet is on the legions of bright and dedicated nerds comprising the crypto-community and their collaborative open-source initiatives rather than the bloated (and in my opinion stagnant) banking infrastructure that has had hundreds of years to implement optimizations and seems to have neglected to significantly do so in all of that time.


The same argument goes for "postal service vs email" and "horse-drawn buggy vs automobile"... It's not actually an argument at all. Just a lack of imagination or foresight.

Yeah, after getting repeatedly rejected I started buying Bitcoins one-or-two-at-a-time...
I have a couple due to arrive in my account in an hour and a half. The price rose $10 today, so I'm anticipating a "high-risk transaction" message is about to come through (if my theory of them scamming me has any truth to it).

@_date: 2013-12-03 19:42:20
I've enjoyed this exchange considerably, and I think you make your points very well, but I just wanted to contribute a thought or two.


Keynesian assumption. This is also a subjective statement.


No, there's not. There's the exact same level of incentive in capital investment: if you want more money, invest your existing money more intelligently. That does not change when you take an economy from an inflationary system to a deflationary one. The name of the game remains the same.


What? I honestly can't even begin to parse this.


I think we've empirically disproven the "trickle-down" effect by now. Please quit parroting that like it's a real argument. 
Wealth redistribution **does not happen** in the status quo inflationary system. That's why we have the 99% v 1% discrepancy. That's not a bunch of hippies complaining that "they have it rough"; that's an actual existing socioeconomic issue. If you are going to argue that "we're doing fine when it comes to redistributing the wealth" you are living in a fantasy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:03:22

* 10 bits = 1c
* 1000 bits = $1
* 1,000,000 bits = $1000 = 1 BTC
* 100 satoshis = 1 bit

The "intrinsic value" of Bitcoin is that it directly allocates the burden of handling/verifying the transactions of an information-based exchange of value to the network as a whole. 
It presents a mechanism ("mining") which amounts to competitive transaction processing and thus, hopefully, minimal fees incurred for that role.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:15:49
"It seems very reasonable to say" is not a very solid argument. Why is iron more intrinsically useful than gold? Why is gold intrinsically more valuable than bitcoin? 
You can't just handwave this part of the post, because it's really the *only* argument you're trying to make. *Why* would you say iron &gt; gold &gt; bitcoin? I don't necessarily agree; convince me.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:52:20
Don't we sort of agree that the penetration rate of Bitcoin has to get to a reasonable number, and thus the price has to rise a few more orders of magnitude before we stabilize (and begin to "thrive as a currency" - as if we're not already)?

Ah, but you'd be lucky to even keep pace with inflation on the interest rates that banks offer consumers. 
The price rise in Bitcoin dwarfs the interest rates banks give. This cannot be denied at the moment. If you have some thorough analysis that leads you to believe that this will not be the case in the future, of course bring it to the table. Until then let's use the numbers we've got and draw our conclusions off those.
As it stands, keeping your money in the bank is basically losing you potential cryptocurrency profits. Sure, they offer "returns" too, but Bitcoin is winning by a long shot right now.

Hello. I've had similar misgivings, but after thinking it through I still think this *could* work, to an extent. 
What will (hopefully) happen is that the massive wealth which is now being concentrated into the 1% will be redistributed somewhat to the portion of the 99% who bought Bitcoin early. Granted, some of the 1% will also get involved with Bitcoin so they will become even *more* wealthy than they already are... but so it goes.
The reason why we can all be millionaires off of Bitcoin is because right now we're all kind of *poor*. We don't realize it, because the basic middle-class living standards are so comfortable these days in the First World, but our aggregate economic output would **already make us rich** if it were distributed more fairly.
I'm sure you've seen those infographics representing the massive discrepancy in wealth distribution these days. Let me know if not and I'll dig one up. Bitcoin could hypothetically "shuffle this around" a bit, by retaining and gaining value as the dollar plummets alongside it.

No... the redlist proposal that Mike Hearn has been proposing would be built directly into the fabric of Bitcoin. "Voluntary adoption" would not be at the merchant-level, it would be at the miner-level.
The problem that was trying to highlight is the fact that once these manipulative mechanisms exist in the network, those with power (US gov't et al) would leverage them to their own purposes and this very feasibly could negatively impact consumers later on.

They were hit with multiple lawsuits at once and it is rumored that they are insolvent. In other words, even though they are still a huge exchange, they might not have enough money (USD) to be able to pay everyone who wants to cash out. 
This is, of course, just speculation without seeing their balance sheets. However, it *is* a legitimate concern because, as you've noticed, why else wouldn't they allow withdrawals?
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:47:31


Yes. That was the easiest question to answer, ever!

You must not have read what he said. 


That means hedge your bets.
He did **not** say: "Go full bitcoin."

Alright man. Have a good night.

Personally I am not worried about my Bitcoins being traced to me at this point in time. If that means I'm "lax in Bitcoin security" then so be it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:09:32
What is a "funbux" man? It seems like you're desperately trying to imbue Bitcoin with a negative connotation, but you don't seem to be succeeding because there's no basis for doing so. If you can buy cars, cellphones, drugs, porn, gifts with it, is there any reason to consider it something *other* than money?
I suppose it is "fun" in that you can make a lot of money just by holding Bitcoins. Do you just mean it's funner than regular $ because your purchasing power increases while you possess bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:07:07
A key insight.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:18:45
I've always thought of it as a flourish, of sorts. 
The first sentence from his original bitcoin.pdf paper:


trusted third parties to process electronic payments. 
He aimed to try a new system. If the whole point is to build a system in which you don't have to trust *anyone*, I think it's perfectly reasonable to stay anonymous to help make your point. By doing so, you prove your point as you're making it.
He was showing off.

~~For Level I verified accounts they will basically charge your bank account, keep the funds (and of course gather interest) for a week, and if the price of Bitcoins rises they just don't pay out and instead refund your purchase while handwaving the scam away by calling it a "high-risk transaction" with no justification.~~ 
~~In other words, at least a small part of their business model appears to hinge on scamming new customers for the first month.~~
I was wrong. They're badass. Go Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:48:18
You responded very well. Hopefully they respond with more information; I'll be checking back here to see if there's an update.

But he wouldn't do so if there was a chance it could get him thrown in jail. 
Investing in a Bitcoin payment processing company right after the Chinese banks forbade things like that could jeopardize a lot more than his capital investment, and I would imagine that this man is a prudent individual and checked up before making any big moves. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:18:17
Agreed. It doesn't even necessarily "point to the negative," either. The example sentence implies the person is just unsure whether this will occur or not.
Meaning they definitely consider it possible.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:45:28
Quite true. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:55:09
I noticed an error on slide 7.




That should probably read "anonymous but not private," eh?
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:40:46


Correct. No central entity makes Bitcoins, so when you buy one, you're actually trading your USD or other currency for the other person's Bitcoins. LocalBitcoins is basically the Craigslist of Bitcoin and it has a nice escrow service that helps with the transactions.


Bingo. The aggregate of these prices is the average current price of a bitcoin.


They go wherever you want to send them. One option is to use a wallet of your own (like MultiBit or Bitcoin-QT) which would essentially give you complete control of your coins - you'd be your own bank. If you do this (or at least if you store a large amount of money in this way), read up extensively on best security practices; you don't want to mess up and put your BTC at risk.
Optionally, you can leave the Bitcoins in the exchange or in an online wallet (like at Coinbase or Blockchain.info). If you do this, you are basically trusting that online wallet provider as if they were your bank... you'll still be able to access and send your bitcoins where you want to, as long as that company has not gone under or turned out to be scam artists or whatever. Do your research before trusting any companies - a cursory Google search goes a long way.


Well, again, this depends on how *you* want to manage *your* funds. You could theoretically leave all (or some) of your Bitcoins in your account at Coinbase, for instance (I do this with a portion of my holdings, in case I want to cash some out conveniently). If you download a Bitcoin client like Bitcoin-QT to run your own wallet on your computer (again, be *very* security-conscious if this is the route you take) then it will have a bunch of addresses pre-generated for you, and you can create more addresses as you go. 
If you want to think of a Bitcoin address as a "bank account for every transaction" you're free to do so, but the basic idea is that **it's very easy to create new addresses and be able to spend the coins associated with them, but very difficult (basically impossible) to spend the coins associated with an address you did not generate**. 


As I mentioned earlier, with LocalBitcoins, sort of. It's almost exactly like Craigslist; if you put the coins out there, eventually you'll hear offers for them.
If you use another company like Coinbase, you can link a US bank account with your Coinbase account and convert your $ to Bitcoin and back at the going-rate for Bitcoins, pretty easily. These are just straight ACH transfers to the bank.
Or you could sign up at an exchange (like Bitstamp or Mt.Gox) and sell the coins there, but in those cases normally you have to involve wire transfers or other mechanisms of cash transfer if you are requesting your profits be sent to you.
In short: there are options.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:50:40


Except for, you know, the fact that *the fees exist*. You keep postulating a world where these fees *don't* exist but you're ignoring reality where they *do*. Why do you bury your head in the sands of fantasy?




It is *very* different. If you want to send me $0.001 for an article I wrote, but you don't think it's worth a penny, you **cannot do so with dollars**. You can with Bitcoin. This is a "microtransaction" and it simply is not viable in other systems. By contrast, it's happening all the time with Bitcoin.


You very much do not understand Bitcoin. We need no crystal ball. We have a protocol.


You don't understand what "monetary inflation" is. It's when more units of currency are produced, thus diluting the purchasing power of the money already in circulation. Bitcoins *cannot* have this, by nature.
The reason that Bitcoins can never hyperinflate is because the process of mining (which is the **only** way to make new Bitcoins) does not allow for more Bitcoins to be produced than a predetermined block reward. 
[Please read this wiki article if you need more information](
There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins. This is not an "unfounded claim," this is verifiable knowledge about the system. Please go do some research before trying to bash this phenomenon. It's clear from your response here that you fundamentally misunderstand Bitcoin (and "inflation" in general). Saying "one day Bitcoin will undergo hyperinflation" is like saying "one day 7 will not be a prime number." It doesn't make sense. It means you don't understand the concepts we're discussing, or you're confused on the terminology.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:17:42
Yeah that discussion was a shitshow. I tried to spread enlightenment; a few listened for a moment. Most just downvoted and scoffed.
It just shows how much potential Bitcoin still has to go up. People who consider themselves "experts" in these matters still have not caught on, even though the trends are obvious at this point.
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:03:42
I hadn't thought of that. Strap in, everyone. We're going well past the moon.

The rapid increases in value are a result of adoption and demand. 
You don't *need* to loan it just yet. The time for Bitcoin loans has not come.

What about Quit cherrypicking bullshit subreddits and assuming that makes your argument any stronger.
@_date: 2013-10-14 04:05:58
I am happy to see the green (it's the color that belongs on the charts) but I'd *really* like things to calm down for just a few more days as I ready more capital to invest.
@_date: 2013-10-21 04:40:33


I've been toying with this idea in my mind for a while.
To me, Bitcoin seems like the Wild Wild West right now, though, and I want to bet on the safest things I can for now. That's why I stick with companies that have been community-verified to be honest and above-board (like Coinbase) and try my best not to get too involved with the riskier ones like Mt.Gox or BFL. 
Just playing it "safe" in Bitcoinland for now, in other words. Or at least as safe as possible.

Terrible answer.
"Reddit has a lot of shit subreddits, so it's like, entrenched, you know? Why should we try and be any better than Reddit at large?"


Where is that writ in stone? That's your flimsy take on it, not the Word of the Reddit Gods. 


How so? "Hurt the subreddit" by culling some of the rampant stupidity from it, you mean? That doesn't sound like "hurting" to me.


That's not what everyone wants. You're pandering to the lowest common denominator, which colloquially is known as "selling out".
Basically you think "hey things are gonna suck inevitably, why should I go out of my way to mitigate that problem?" You're just lazy.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:25:31

No. You are lowballing it very hard.
(I know you weren't asking me, but I still want to chime in. Sorry; thanks.)
We will see $1000 Bitcoins by December. We may droop a bit from there, but don't count on it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:12:37
Of course. But not today. Not today, *at all*.
In a week and a half, we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:56:51


No... the $800 number is entirely arbitrary. You have no actual figures or data telling you "it's too small for its shoes" and you're just guessing.
This is not real analysis. Tell me what a fair price for a Bitcoin is, if not $800 or so. 
I think Bitcoin is too small for its shoes and that a more reasonable fair price is somewhere around $2k. Why are your numbers better than mine? So far, every day makes me look a little more right.
I'm not saying we *won't* bubble, crash, bubble, crash. Of course we will. It's the nature of the beast. But you're talking as if we're already at the peak of the bubble and we're about to plummet... this is not a foregone conclusion. I think we'll add another thousand bucks to the price tag before we're at risk of any current bubble popping... and I have plenty of reasons for believing so.

Ok, thank you for the source. Somehow the 2 hits had indeed become blurred as one in my mind.


Technically, no. was talking about the blackmailer (FriendlyChemist). Essentially everyone in the discussion thus far has been talking about the blackmailer.

Sorry; not convinced at all. Your argument basically boils down to "Reporters said it so it must be true" + hyperbole.
Looks *a lot* more like a smear campaign from every angle I can see. You claim it's basically an undisputed "fact" that he is a loathsome person and that he's an asshole etc etc but I humbly disagree. I still think he's a stand-up guy and that he has demonstrated great nobility and prudence throughout his life and career. 
I have read enough articles to get a similar impression concerning his narcissism or egocentric view, but to be fair, he *does* sound like one of the more badass and intelligent persons I've ever researched. Having pride in their achievements and work is not a real reason to hate a person over. 
Here's the real reason I still support him: from every *fact* that I can see, he's in the right. Every quote I've seen attributed to him and every interview I've seen him do strike me as balanced, informed, careful, intelligent. I've seen slander, too, but it's always secondhand and dubious compared to the firsthand glimpses of his character that I've managed to witness.
Sorry, your wall of text just didn't do it for me. I've been having a similar debate with a friend for some time now, so I've heard it all before, and it still comes up short of influencing my opinion of the man. Honestly it just makes me pity the populace a little more, knowing that the media is able to spin things so effectively and so few readers actually do their own thinking.
