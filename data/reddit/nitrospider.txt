what are you doing, you've posted this comment twice here. You new here freind? or just another ethereum fanboy spammer?

Completely unethical. Also consider the amount of money they spent marketing the damn thing (literally millions). 
@_date: 2016-02-16 05:06:59
alright thats three times now, you're not doing yourself any service bud.

Also, i dont know if you've ever tried to send ethereum over the network, but it litterally takes HOURS to complete a transaction.

I appreciate the explanation, however this leads me to ask one more question. 
If there are 2^96 possible private/public keypairs that could correspond with any given address, does that mean any said group of 2^96 public keys could generate the same address as oneanother? How does the blockchain know what the corresponding public address is?

Exactly. 
This video is hilarious, though i don't see it's relevance.

I could release a cryptocurrency with a million confirmations a second, its an arbitrary variable set by the creator, just like the amount of coins in circulation.

Ethereum was premined, had an ipo and is not scalable, It's a large scale pump and dump scam. The technology is neat the currency is worthless.

I understand that trezor uses a random word seed, has this technology been comprimised at all?

If you really beleived in the ethereum technology you would not be holding Ethereum, you would be holding the ethical DOA clone Expanse, because any coin with a premine of considerable size is a scam and (90% premine is extremely unreasonable). The source code is up, meaning that if this technology is the future, Ethereum will not be. An ethical clone will be much more attractive to anyone reasonable.

Buy a single purpose computer to store your coins, I would recommend Trezor. You should not trust 3rd parties with your wealth, that's the whole idea behind decentralization.
