Binomial models for probability, P(1 success in 1000000 trials) = One success in 1 million seconds of trying for a block = (1000000 choose 1 ) (1/1000000) (1-1/1000000)^(999999) = .36 where 1000000 seconds is about 10 days, ish. I did the math earlier and I am approximating my memory of it.
EDIT: Figured out that I fucked up, I assumed one success every second, multiply my time (10 days) by 600 and you get the real estimated probability, a 36% chance in two years. Not counting rising difficulties etc etc...

Bitcoin is only valuable because people say its valuable, just like gold.

I appreciate this response

List out the things you can do with a dollar, this list is very long. Compare this to the list of the things you can do with a bitcoin, this list is very short.

But its not the same, I can trust that everyone in America who wants to exchange goods or services with me will do so with an appropriate amount of dollars. I can trust nobody in America, or anywhere else on Earth, to exchange bitcoin with me.

The dollar is valuable because it is very commonly used as an exchange of goods and services, Bitcoin is not. I can take a dollar to any store or restaurant in America and exchange it for something that I consider valuable, I cannot do the same thing with Bitcoin. Sure there are some online retailers that accept Bitcoin but the scope and value can't compare to the dollar.

If this is the case, assuming binomial probability model holds here for independent seconds of hashing, wouldn't I have a 36% chance of getting a block within 10 days and a better chance after that of getting $100,000 presumably a lot more than the price of the rig and electricity? I have a very rudimentary understanding of both probability and bitcoin

I made a comment about this slightly below

Sure, this is a completely reasonable claim to make. However, why would bitcoin become the standard? Because its purely digital and decentralized? To the uninitiated this seems very risky. Bitcoin becoming a standard of exchange also makes it difficult to make in-person transactions while every current physical currency has adapted to have online use, bitcoin adapting to have physical use seems pretty impossible. There are limits to digital currency and I don't see why they could be overcome to displace modern currency as a standard.
