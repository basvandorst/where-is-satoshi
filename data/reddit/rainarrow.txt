It's actually a good thing because it indicates new people are joining the market 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:20:44
Well I guess the market is far from rational, they see “ban” and “shutdown” and they panic sell

No worries, China will be banning Bitcoin again tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:06:16
Sources say the Chinese gov is going to shut down all mining operations. Then later news stated it’s only going to regulate the electricity usage, not closing them.

Instead you spend the mining cost of South Africa

No, Bitcoin is only known to give cancer in the State of California. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:18:43
Phew, at least I know I'm safe now
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:22:56
Yeah, just fuck off, mate
@_date: 2018-09-28 02:41:46
Do you mean on-chain transactions or exchange trade volume?
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:57:28
No I don't. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:15:06
Probably just another delay. Small chance of straight denial, although unlikely. Approval at this time would be a miracle.

Everyone keep saying that, but the 5800 has been branched before and bounced quickly for 2 times 
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:53:15
Looks the price took very little reaction though 
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:55:29
Could it be because CBOE future expiration?
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:34:25
Bakkt is subject to CFTC approval though

1.	The Bitcoin blockchain (or any fork using the Bitcoin protocol) gets updated every 10 min ON AVERAGE. It fluctuates with hashrate. For example, if lots of new hashrate is added to the network, blocktime will be reduced to &lt;10min until the next difficulty adjustment. 
2.	Consensus simply means everyone agrees on the content (ordered transactions) of a block. If everyone can generate a block whenever they want (without the mining protocol), then the network will be flooded with every version of blocks that includes recent transactions(which can be included in different orders) and none of them will get consensus.

So we better make sure he never wakes up again??

@_date: 2018-10-02 02:33:05
Didn’t we have something very similar in 2014-15?

The price discovery has finished after 10 years, and the market has determined the fair price of a Bitcoin to be 6650

If you don't do transactions frequently then it doesn't make a difference - just do them on chain.
It only makes sense if you exchange money often - in which case you keep a LN channel open, and only settle on-chain once in a while.

I agree a traditional “escrow” requires trust between the 2 parties involved in the transaction and the escrow, which defeats the trustless nature of crypto transactions. Good point.

Not just life. It’s life, the universe, and everything 
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:59:00
And that “intermediary address” is typically called an escrow account

You spelt HODL wrong
