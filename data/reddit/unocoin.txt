First, I like the fact that Mr. Rajan, while he was heading the IMF many years ago, confidently stood in front of the world and predicted the 2008 crisis.  Secondly, I love the fact that he's an electrical engineer and has the capacity to understand bitcoin at a protocol level.  He doesn't need to read the newspaper about bitcoin, he can read Satoshi's whitepaper (and actually get it!).

Both volatility and security are much less of a concern today as opposed to a year or two ago.  In another 1 or 2 years, concerns over volatility and security will reduce even further.  The fact that he acknowledges that "virtual currencies will certainly get much better, much safer and over time will be the form of transaction” is a very promising sign.

I absolutely agree.  But you must admit, the points he brought up are actually non-issues.  Gandhi said it best:  "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."

They can try (see mintchip), but when you have all the smartest people on earth (Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Michael Dell, Marc Andreesen, Nas, Snoop, etc :) speaking highly of bitcoin, the writing is on the wall.   It is like saying that 'governments really want to invent their own internet'.

Unocoin is India's Leading Bitcoin Company.  We make it easy to securely buy, use and accept bitcoin online. 
Unocoin just released the world's first Bitcoin Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).  SIP is a new and exciting way to acquire bitcoin.
Rather than spending all of your money on bitcoin at once, this is a more conservative approach towards investing in bitcoin. This technique allows you to commit a fixed INR amount towards bitcoin on a regular schedule irrespective of the price. You need to fund your INR wallet and schedule the orders to start with SIP. You may invest as little as 50 INR per interval. This feature helps with financial discipline by averaging out your cost and there by reducing your risk and exposure.
