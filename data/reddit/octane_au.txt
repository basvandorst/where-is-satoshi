The first recorded Gold prices? You mean before FIAT? When one ounce = one ounce. Or after FIAT? When it was manipulated?  Compared to the first recorded Bitcoin prices when no one had heard of it, and you could mine thousannds of them on your computer at home in a day?
My point is, it's a useless comparison. Particularly for people who bought Bitcoin 1 year ago who would have twice as much money left had they bought gold instead.
The first 6 or 7 years of Bitcoins price history is irrelevant really, because the the stock to flow ratio was so poor compared to gold, and the general public weren't aware of it. Even now, they're not, and 99% of people (even people currently holding it) still don't understand its place in today's or tomorrow's financial system, and why hard, as opposed to soft money is so important.
Stop talking about prices, and start to educate yourself on hard vs soft money, and that's where you'll see the real value of Bitcoin (and the lack of value of altcoins because they're not hard money like Bitcoin/gold is)

I'd like to see these stats for buying gold vs bitcoin 12 months ago though.

The OP was simply cherry picking dates as you mentioned, and it's a pointless exercise, which is why I made my first comment about also being able to cherry pick dates to disprove the OP.
Do some research on stock to flow, and hard money vs soft money. I'm not saying bitcoin isn't a good bet, because it is. But using price only is akin to the idiocy of the tulip craze because you're not understanding the real value of Bitcoin as a Hard Money system.
What if bitcoin goes to 1,000,000, but  you can still only buy a cheap car with 1 bitcoin, because rather than bitcoin going up, the USD (or whatever FIAT system you use) becomes near worthless?  People bought Tulips because the value went up exponentially, but at the end of the day, it was just a flower which could be planted (printed) at will and people got rekt.
That's why HARD Money is so important, because it becomes more scarce over time compared to soft money (FIAT, Tulips etc) which can be printed and devalued at will, and if you don't get that, then you're in Bitcoin for short sighted reasons.
This is also why all Alt-coins don't qualify as hard money because they're not sufficiently protected by their network's hash rate to prevent a 51% attack, which means they're not immutable. Bitcoin however, is sufficiently protected in that regard, so that and it's stock to flow ratio qualify it as Hard Money.
Anyway, all I really wanted to do was show that OP was cherry picking dates which simply weren't relevant to each other. 10 years ago, bitcoin was unheard of, and useless as a financial instrument. Gold already had thousands of years of market integration. It's a pointless comparison.

I second has turned pretty toxic in the last year or so. All they seem to do is bang on about censorship issues, and fud anyone who doesn't support their idea of on-chain scaling.
I'm totally fine with constructive and respectful debates, and I do agree with a lot of the points raised in that sub, but it generally doesn't seem that they're capable of having these debates without sensationalized accusations and insults. Every time I go there, I leave angry at the childish finger pointing and general lack of any constructive arguments.

Yeah back in early 2017 I bought $500 of hashing power on a 1 year contract split between mining BTC and Zcash, and it returned well under $100 over the year. Total scam, even in a huge bull market.

I've seen people just giving out a paper note with the private key containing some Satoshis, instructions on how to redeem (like a mobile wallet link etc), and a statement saying that if it's not redeemed within a week, it will be forfeited back to the tipper.
Good way to get people interested in using the infrastructure!

I've been using BTCMarkets since mid-2016 and have had literally zero issues or complaints with them. Personally I hate Bcash/BCH or whatever they want to call it, but BTCM are using the correct ticker symbol. No reason to boycott them.
Vote with your wallet and just don't trade Bcash with them.

If you bought before mid-2017, you haven't lost anything except paper profits, and we all know paper profits are not profits. :-)

This is why Jamie Dimon etc will be on the wrong side of history.

That's exactly when things are manipulated. When it's calm.
Accumulation and distribution phases. Then when they're done, they pump (or dump, depending on their intentions) and let the average retail guy FOMO their way in and push the price higher (or lower)
Once the retail guys are in, the smarter whales are reversing their positions.

Unless they have the secret key on them, they're trash.
