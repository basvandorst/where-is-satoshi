Bitcoin is complicated and hard to use, what if we all worked together to make paper or digital notes that REPRESENTED the bitcoin... and we traded that instead? That would save a lot of time and energy!
That way everyone could use it! We could even get a group of people to hold onto the coins themselves to keep them safe (there is a limited supply after all.)
I understand that it would be dangerous to just trust that group of people, but what if the government protected the people from bad behavior by making sure that it was insured and stable by other "Bitcoin distribution and safe-holding organizations" (better name to come)

Well then I hope your economic status represents your intelligence.

Well then you have a good point, maybe we do need a new system.  
This one obviously doesn't work

I don't know if you know what you're stance is, that or I don't.  
In 3 sentences you went from  "they need bitcoin to prevent corruption, manipulation and corruption" to "I will enslave them with my disproportionate power that they can't hope to compete with"  
Why do YOU think the social and economic benefits of bitcoin are, and why does society need it if it will lead to massive inequality (I don't think that it will, but you implied that you think it will)?

I never claimed to be a bright man, and I'm doubling down now...I didn't know anyone else used dollars, and that their dollars were worth less than ours. It makes sense why we say "the US Dollar" now though. I thought it was "your honor" or "her Royal Highness" rules. 
I think it'd be best if I stop trying to make financial decisions for myself.

This is exactly the kind of apocalypse scale fear-mongering I needed to buy some more bitcoin!   
I mean I was buying it anyway.... but this scare-tactic (more justified than the mass medias scare-tactics because we're the good guys ofc ) really helped me out a lot! Thanks!
