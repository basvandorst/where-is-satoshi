Mostly a FUDing hater. When bitcoin hits $1000 im gonna buy it all up then hire two hookers and snort coke off their asses. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:31
$100 here we come

the only adoption bitcoin has ever had is in the dark web for buying drugs and shit. You're probably right. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:55:52
ye I think lightning ruined bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:20:59
what if this means bitcoin is actually topping out and people are resorting to alt coins? Could be the bubble popping... certainly looks like it
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:10:21
huge wave of normies piling in. It's hitting critical mass. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:20:12
i'd say it'll reach 6-7 trillion cap before the bubble bursts
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:50:14
ye tether is about to crash this whole crypto market
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:38:58
I think the bubble is popping
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:37:07
death to carbon taxes! alalalalalallaallalala
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:29:52
Just bought some more bitcoin cash! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:15:59
Ye everyone coin is down. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:24
Is this the beginning of the bubble burst? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:22:16
I can't wait for Emperor Trump to kill taxes

I think bitcoin will see at least a 50% correction within the next couple of years but it'll overall keep trending upwards. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:31:40
omg that's genius! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:20
Not everyone who is selling is panic selling. I estimate a good portion is stop losses being reached. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:19:38
Ill be rubbing my hands together gleefully while they are shipped off to a fema camp when the fiat bubble bursts. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:18:05
Draining the swamp as we type! 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:51:33
yeah my thoughts exactly lmao. If bitcoins becomes a global currency a 10% drop could cause a massive economic depression to tirgger
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:48:16
wow its so interesting see this information out in the open... like it's just there for anyone. I wonder what the largest bank account in the world is... 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:25:52
Seems like central bankers' worst nightmare... The part on it being programmable stood out the most. My kidnapping business can finally take off where I'll get my bitcoins every time. The transaction scripts ensures it.
