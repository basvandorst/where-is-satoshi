Not going to delete the post, but I totally understand your point of view. Blockchain is the future, who is this loser with his sob story? Hopefully, we're both millionaires in 10 years. Cheers!

I still don't get it: trading a super-simple last name like "Bell" which no one has trouble pronouncing or spelling, for a longer, more difficult last name?! Speaking as a person who has a long last name that everyone has been mispronouncing my entire life, this seems insane to me.

Andreas, go do your homework.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:52:57
Yeah, I don't want to really get into the merits of it. I was more curious if anything came of it. Here you have the top guy in the Bitcoin-space dumping water on himself, then nominating some other well known individuals, and then nothing... not a tweet from Andreas or Roger saying they donated instead of dumping water on their heads. Seemed a little cringe-worthy to be honest, that it didn't really amount to anything.

She beat me up today because I went and saw my family on Christmas. I'm not a weakling, but I'm not going to hit her back, as I'm afraid I would lose my kids, so I just let her hit me in the head over and over. In my heart, I know I should leave her, but I fear the reality of seeing my kids on the weekends, as well as financial things that won't be good if I leave her. Come on Bitcoin... to the moon!

Dvorak is a joke. He's spent decades writing click-bait articles.

I think you mean it was shit. Embarrassing.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:07:37
She thinks my family is horrible and I shouldn't spend time with them. Obviously, I'm biased, but my family are nice people. Her parents even say she's crazy, but they are too afraid of her to do anything about it. In terms of physical violence: as a man you can't do shit. If I were to call the cops, she could just say that I hit her, and I would be forced to leave the house, if not arrested.

By the way, the type of "object" i'm referring to would ideally be something along the lines of Kialara: 
I love it, unfortunately, it's not trustless.

Guys, maybe put on a tie and sit behind a desk or something. The content is good, but man it's hard to watch the visuals. Presentation is important.

 sorry. I'm a bit drunk at the moment, and maybe revealed too much.

Isn't this a good thing? It's better if consumers have more transparency into the fees they are paying. Typically, these are hidden fees buried in the sale price. Think it through: this actually helps Bitcoin.

I have thought of that many times. How do I install hidden cameras all over the house without her noticing the installation? I do have audio recordings on my iPhone from various incidents, but it's hard to prove context with muffled audio alone. I will consider the camera option, but it's going to be tough to have enough of them installed around the house (running on batteries?) waiting for an incident to occur... and hoping she doesn't find one in the meantime?!

Wow, it's held as much as: $1,706.48.

It's completely hypothetical. I'm just wondering what the answer is when taking these conditions into account. The math shouldn't be that difficult, and I'm sure others have arrived at an answer years ago.
@_date: 2014-10-19 05:56:17
But if it's BIP-38 encrypted or something like that then someone is in possession of the passphrase that unlocks the private key, correct? If so, then how can you ever "sell" a physical bitcoin, without telling the buyer what the passphase is? You would both be in possession of the passphrase at that point. What I am proposing is a completely trustless system, where no one, at any point, has had access to the private key, in any manner, whether it be encrypted or not.

Yeah, she's a technology luddite. The bitcoin stash is safe.

So easy on paper, right? We're in the middle of renovating a house and have a pre-construction condo that will be ready at the end of 2015. We're literally talking about a million dollars, and we are middle-class people. She doesn't seem to care about driving us both into debt. I'm stuck with her at least until 2016, at which point I can probably make a cleaner break, but it breaks my heart that the kids are in the middle of this. At the same time I feel guilty for subjecting the kids to this.

No one is cheating. She's just a psycho.

No diversification is good: hence, the reason we have some real-estate holdings, as well as other investments. Bitcoin actually makes up a tiny fraction of my investments, at this point.

 are you serious with that comment? First of all it's rather presumptuous: maybe I have let jesus christ into my life. But I haven't. I'm an atheist. She's Hindu. I can feel you nodding your head across the internet...

So is it fair to say then that the upper limit would be:
@_date: 2014-09-28 06:45:23
It's a decentralized, cryptographically-secure form of payment. It's trustless, meaning that peer to peer transactions can occur in a safe manner, without fear of double-spending. No middle-men required. It's finite and not controlled by a governing body that can continue to print more of it, thus diluting its value. It's the internet of money.

What you describe sounds awesome. My concern, however, is permanence of the private key over time (perhaps decades) given that you are storing it in flash memory. I was hoping that there could be a more mechanical solution where the private key is actually set in a more permanent form, that's not so easily wiped-out.
Imagine a chain of 256 on/off bits. In my example, I used magnetic bucky-balls that would lock into a chain as the object is shaken which completes a circuit. The orientation they happen to take as the chain is built is either 1 or 0, so you get your randomized chain of 256 bits -- the private key. Maybe magnets are not the best example, as vigorous shaking would probably not get them to separate within the object, so they would likely all be stuck together as soon as the object is produced.
But ultimately the goal would be some degree of permanence of the private key, like the the tumblers on a briefcase lock they wouldn't move on their own if encased within the object: 
So initially the "bits" need to be able to shake around to produce a random result, but then you need to make the private key persistent. My example was the pin in a grenade. Pulling the pin out, locks the "bits" in place. Would last years/decades/centuries without any power so it could be safely used as money.

Unfortunately, I can't save the kids. One of the big reasons I'm still here is to protect the kids. It's very, very difficult for a man to get the kids in this type of circumstance. More likely scenario is that I would be forced to leave.

Long term, buddy. I bought in at $150, so even the current price is a good return.

Nice effort, but I'm sorry that looks terrible.

I think I read that the 100,000,000 units that make up each bitcoin could technically be divided even further, maybe through a hard fork. Even if this isn't the case, if Bitcoin ever got to this level, you would have off-chain transactions that would divide up Satoshis even further.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:17:18
That's all fine. I'm not quibbling with the total amount. I'm quibbling with the block reward number. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:22:43
2 kids. Also: it's not a million dollars in debt, as these assests (homes) have value and can be sold. So really, worst case scenerio we're probably talking about $100K at stake. Why did I sign-off on it? Cuz I'm an idiot, who thought that buying her the house of her dreams would help resolve our issues. Yes, I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:14:43
Yeah, but it doesn't even end cleanly in 140 years or so. It gets to the point where the division leads to less than a satoshi so mining has to stop. He should have worked backwards: decide on a year he wanted mining to end and have the block reward be exactly 1 satoshi and then multiple backwards to 2009.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:28:24
Yeah, I should probably keep my mouth shut about bitcoin around her.
