I suggest Bitcoin Cash Core, BCC.
Or Bitcoin Core Cash.  
Doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:00:32
Just look at th price of BCash, and Ver's other nasty project - ZCash, and how they are holding against BTC.
The lunatics, ladies and gentlemen, have NOT taken over the asylum.
Kind Regards.

er, my son knows how to claim my BTC in the event of my death.  Does that help?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:09:49
'people had access to the same amount of coins'
Pity that even after screwing up they can't at least be grammatical: it is same 'number' of coins, not 'amount.'
Sloppy work all round.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:15:21
The truth, Mr Ver, will always out.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:25:02
Don't worry, BCash is dead.  Look at its price against BTC.
I'm fully out.
Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:13:52
Of course it is not, it is a Ver shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:10:42
..and in a market that is untrusted, their known untrustworthiness is causing everything they touch to do the anti-Midas touch - it turns to shit.
Take, for example, the recent terrible performances of Shitcoin Cash and ZCash - both of them Ver projects and therefore not trusted.
Invest in honesty, above all, for a medium to long term gain: e.g. BTC (despite its flaws) and Monero (despite its flaws!)
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:01:42
He's taken all the mugs' money.  
And kept all his real BTC by all accounts.
He's probably bored with that scam BCash project now.
I wish he were back in prison.

If you've got thousands of dollars stored - why quibble over a few dollars?  I use the Trezor.  Very intuitive, and not so tiny you could lose it.  
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:16:51
I got out of ZCash when I saw the Ver connection.  Put that 20% of my real BTC portfolio into Monero instead.
Both are proper, decentralised, cryptocoins with real trust and/or utility.
Imagine my happiness to see that, although BTC has suffered, both BCash and ZCash have suffered more than my new, *honest*, portfolio.
Good luck mate.

Quantity is grammatically better, but as a countable noun, 'number' goes with coins.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:46:52
Don't be silly - would you rather have your son lose his inheritance?
He has all the low security details.  The final high security details are stored elsewhere for him.
Tut!  Do you think you are all being chased after by masked men?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:50:24
It is here to stay.  3 months maximum for 20k again.  I've seen all this before.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:02:44
Fuck off, pedant.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:56:28
What are people's thoughts on the continuing threat to BTC from hard-forks, in particular the BCash fork which has claimed to be BTC and even taken over r/BTC?
Will this cause continued instability and FUD when BTC recovers?
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:32:38
Thanks, that is very comforting and sensible.  
In an old-fashioned way, I just hate dishonesty, and wouldn't want it to play out for them.
I wouldn't mind at all if they were an honest coin, and had even kept their distinctive green logo.  But the hijacking of the orange, and r/BTC etc. is reprehensible to me.  Anyway, cheers for your wise words.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:39:16
So it is not relevant that a fake coin is impinging upon you?  Christ, maybe Ver is right.  And I hate to say that, you CNT.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:48:59
BCash aka Shitcoin Cash = 0.12 BTC today, and continuing to fall.
I hate their scam with a passion, but luckily it isn't working anyway.  
You'd be a fool to purposefully buy this dishonest little coin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:39:04
It is a conspiracy!  Run by, er, blockchain, er, or something.
p.s.  BCash = 0.133
To the moon.  Not sure which moon.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:04:02
I Ver what you are saying.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:52:31
Have CONbase completed their investigation about the alleged insider-dealing surrounding the sudden launch of Ver's shitcoin on their platform?
Have they refunded all people who bought this altcoin at 8000 USD?
Have the links between Ver and CONbase been uncovered yet?  
I have a journalist friend who has uncovered most of this quagmire, but who would like more information before going to print.
Please furnish.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:23:09
Monero will do just fine - don't worry.  
Monero is the perfect complement to BTC - I'm in for 20%
There are some real shitcoins out there - neither real BTC or Monero are one of them.
Hold on for a few weeks - you'll see !
Good luck mate.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:43:17
Heh - you silly sausage.
p.s. I will sell you a sausage for one BCash - don't delay, it may be the best deal you get.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:00:35
Is this the real Bitcoin?
I thought BCash was the real bitcoin.
Doh!  Now I am really confused.
I'd better cross-post this to the guys at BTC and see what those mendacious bastards think.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:54:51
Ver is also behind Zcash, which is why the privacy coin part of my portfolio is Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:31:47
Almost all is red.  And that would mean crypto as a concept is dead - which is unlikely.  
Ethereum doing quite well - but I don't rate it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:32:13
Heh.  Some are falling faster than others - notably Ver's dishonest shitcoin.
Do you enjoy stating the obvious?
I love it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:01:36
I have never encouraged anyone to buy anything.  I also have no objection to BCH as a hard-fork, but I do object to blatant dishonesty and passing off.
I bought my real BTC several years ago, and they have been a good investment.  I received your shitcoin free, and luckily sold them at 1.8 and moved into a more honest coin with greater utility - it is doing extremely well.
Correction: 0.18 - Heh - that will be the day!
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:09:00
I don't recall nations' constitutions being dishonest, passing-off, and symbolised by a convicted criminal with his middle finger stuck up.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:04:40
Pure FUD
