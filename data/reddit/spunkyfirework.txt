I feel your pain. I've made mistakes along the way and lost money, actually goofed up today and lost $200 on GDAX due to using the Stop / Limit in completely the wrong way, which was the final incentive to write this guide and get it verified by the community to hopefully help other people like me out.
I mean, the main thing is how volatile and unpredictable it is. I did a Stop Limit sale on 1 BTC at $3300 couple of hours ago because I figured it would drop even lower, and it sure did, and my BTC was converted back to USD. Went further down for a couple hours too. Now it's up at $3400 so I really should wait for it to drop below $3300 before I re buy. But then it's like, what if it just keeps going up though, and I miss the train completely? I dunno. You kind of have to know when to go with your gut and when to cut and run. I wish I had cashed out a couple weeks back when it was scraping $5000 but you live and learn – that was before I knew about GDAX and the selling fee on Coinbase was eye watering.
I've found the investing.com quite useful. There's comments at the bottom of the page too, which vary from spam to quite insightful. But ultimately nobody anywhere really knows what is going on. It's a crap shoot. 
Some people say hold (or HODL, I should say), some say SELL it's going to down to zero, others say perfect time to BUY. I guess just go with your gut and treat it like Vegas i.e. – don't buy any more than you're willing to lose and you'll be ok.

SO, regarding the Limit / Stop thing, I guess it's just not possible to have a thing set up where you say "ok, sell if it goes up $100, but also sell if it goes down $50" Like kind of a double ended protection / profit thing?

Yeah that's a good solution. Also, I wasnt aware that the trading programs supported crypto.

AH, good to know. Yes I've seen fees on my fulfilled order lists and wondered why.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:22:58
I see no reason why not. I actually tested these out on much smaller amounts (0.01 BTC) as I was writing it.

Thanks. I guess so, yes. I also posted it to I'm not interested in trading specifically, I'm just extremely interested in not paying Coinbase buying fees. 4% Credit Card / 1.5% Bank Account vs 0.25% on GDAX (or in the case of Limit or Stop orders, FREE!) And with Coinbase owning GDAX, they allow free transfer between the two websites.
Luckily I'm kinda new to crypto, so i've only been using Coinbase for a few months. I'd really be kicking myself had I discover that like 5 years from now.

*** I just fixed the  in the post. A copy / paste goof up had 3450 as the stop figure instead of 3400 ***

Thanks. Good to know it's pretty correct. This was my first stab at it, i'm no expert. I have a vague understanding of the Bid and Ask but thats about where my knowledge ends regarding how it affects the spread, etc.
