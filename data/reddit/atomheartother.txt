Sorry if I said anything wrong, that's just how it sounded and it sounded very cute. I don't speak a word of the language.

There's a Bitcoin ATM being built in Montreal too, I saw it today!

Why is this getting downvoted? he's asking a question.
I recommend you watch [this video by vihart]( explains it pretty well in my humble opinion.
Edit: Now me? Ok am I missing something here, what the fuck reddit

"Bitocoino" said by that announcer is the cutest thing ever.
Yes, yes, right, people losing money.
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:18:10
Thanks! This is awesome!
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:42:43
This is theft.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:59:06
Thanks for asking - and being replied to - I didn't get it either c:

This wouldn't have happened if those people didn't store their BTC in an **exchange**.
@_date: 2014-04-15 06:12:52
might be interested in this!
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:34:57
I'm sorry what was that?
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:37:54
Sorry for the silly question, how does one put Bitcoin in a physical envelope?
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:17:58
I would boycott paypal, but I just don't have another alternative to send and receive money online... Though now Bitcoin has started to grow I try to use it as little as possible and buy on sites that allow bitcoin...

@_date: 2014-02-26 18:35:38
That was very clever and you should feel good.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:36:54
This is sarcastic right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:34:06
I am so havily confused by this comment, are you implying greed doesn't exist, or that anyone acknowledging its existence is an idiot, or something else?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:25:57
I feel like I'm missing some context here.
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:48:23
I didn't get the reference.
^^I ^^still ^^upvoted.

I WAS TOO FOCUSED ON THE KITTY 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:10:20
Nope, 0.001 !
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:39:16
Well in a way, this is all 15 bucks I invested months ago to me, I wouldn't care **that** much about losing it but obviously that wouldn't be fun.
But then if I withdraw it it's... 0.001 BTC fee! That's like 6 cents, **do you even know what I can buy with 6 cents?!**
You're right, doing that now, thanks Edit: yes. 60 cents. I know, Shh.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:05:25
Now I'm slightly upset, we were on the way to 1k but then everyone sold ;_;
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:38:19
I don't get why this is a systematic reply to any post saying bitcoin is similar to a market.
We get that it's not a market, but you have to admit, it behaves a whole lot like one.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:57:06
I understand, however they may have different causes to their behavior, the matter of the fact is that Bitcoin obeys a lot of classic economics law...
I'm not denying what you're saying is true in any way, I agree, but yeah, we're not contradicting each other in any way.

What's USD?
