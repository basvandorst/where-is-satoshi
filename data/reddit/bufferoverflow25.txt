i dont mean to make you look bad, but i was really worried as my rent is due saturday..
Eduardo Fernandez, a guy working for you was the one emailing me, i just checked my mail, he emailed me a little while back "Hello! Thank you for your message and sorry for the delay in getting your SEPA withdrawals.
We had an issue with our system last week that has now been fixed, your withdrawals will reach you most likely tomorrow.
You can read more in our community forum here: 
I am very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.
Bye! Let us know if we can help you with anything else."
sorry for panicking without reason, but you can imagine how it looked from my perspective

yea i figured it out, some of the btc's used in the transaction where still getting confirmed and that transaction took a while to finish
it took around 10h total
the fee was 46 satoshi/byte, so it was ok, not too much but should have been confirmed within an hour where all the btc ok to start with...
