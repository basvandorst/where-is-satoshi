Fake site, from the source code:


&lt;big style="font-family: Shruti; font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;big style="font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold;"&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span style="color: white; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold;"&gt;2. Image to hide the file&amp; in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold;" /&gt;
&lt;span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold;"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=" onclick="this.href='/WinRAR-x64-501.exe'" style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold;"&gt;Compression Software: WinRAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br style="font-weight: bold;" /&gt;
The download link looks like a normal URL but from the code you can tell it downloads a different file located on the server.
OP thinks he's being smart by using private WHOIS but you can still report him to GoDaddy and let them know what's going on.
So no OP, they don't host the file locally, you've asked the code to download the file from your local server and made it look like it's downloading from the WinRAR site.

Assets - maybe.
Property - I don't see how they classified as property because technically anything that you own is property unless you use it in the sense of physical location. If were classing Bitcoin as property then we should be classing fiat money as property since it belongs to one individual.
Best thing to do would be to class it as a digital item in the form of a private key. You simply can't attempt to classify Bitcoin as property because just because someone has access to a private key doesn't always mean they own in, in cases of stolen keys for example. There is no way to prove transfer of ownership, all you can prove is that x individual used x private key to access x wallet.

Don't know why the fuck you're getting downvoted. This is why I hate Reddit's hivemind sometimes but I thought at least in the more technically inclined subreddits there'd be more maturity and actually debate instead of people just downvoting. We're here to discuss - that's how people grow. Not by shunning posts down (with the exception of spam.)
Anyway back on topic, the Bitcoins weren't seized because they were a currency. They were seized simply they hold value. In any kind of drug case they will usually take all proceeds from the case that they can trace. For example, imagine Ross had a shitty home before the supposed start of SR. 6 months in he buys a $1 million mansion. Feds would seize the house unless they Ross could prove he brought it through legitimate funds.
Anything of value can be seized, this includes virtual things such as domain names.

Sadly, Moneypak can do what they like.
Clearly states:
Cancellation and Suspension. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit your use of the MoneyPak. We may suspend the use of the MoneyPak with or without cause or notice, other than as required by applicable law. If you would like to cancel the use of your MoneyPak and obtain a refund for the remaining balance, call Green Dot at 1-800-GREENDOT. Our cancellation of MoneyPak privileges will not otherwise affect your rights and obligations under this Agreement. If we cancel or suspend your MoneyPak privileges through no fault of yours, you will be entitled to a refund of any remaining balance, as provided in this Agreement.'
People need to start reading the terms and conditions. Companies are getting away with what you deem as immoral because you're allowing them to. When you opened up a PayPal account you agreed to their terms and conditions. When you redeemed that Moneypak you agreed to follow their rules. If you don't like what they're doing, stop using their service. Let them know that you're not going to stand for it and take your business elsewhere. Companies like eBay and PayPal aren't there because they're always good companies, they're there because they've dominated their respective markets and made it easy for you to use their services.
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:51:00


Yeah that's because they're at the top of their respective ladders. You have to be in a certain position to make those kind of transactions. Not everyone can just jump in...unlike BTC, if you hit a good niche then you're set, like PrimeDice / SatoshiDice. It's not like they are geniuses, but damn $11mill for a website that looks after itself? Not too bad imho.

I wasn't taking anyone's side. I merely replied to you because I thought it was aimed at me. I agree that lizard could have put it in a much more polite way but there was no need for your sarcasm. You're the one who asked for clarification on a subject and I explained to you that policy is policy.

BFL have stated that since their products are shipping, no refunds are being sent. You could have obtained a refund before shipping started.
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:17:15
I agree that BFL is a bad company but people really need to stop saying you will not get a ROI. ROI depends completely on how much BTC will be worth in the future. Not to mention unless you specifically brought BTC to fund then you would have been better of holding onto it but I'm fairly sure the majority of people are early adopters who hoarded their coins.
Let's look at it this way. I had 10 coins when the price was $10. I waited until we reached the peak of $210. I sold them all. My profit is about $2000. I invest $300 of that into the Jalepeno. If I get my Jalepeno in the next few weeks, I will make on average 0.04 coins. At the moment, yes it will take me a long time to make back $300, BUT in about 6 months time, I will have about 5 coins (let's say 5 to make up for difficulty) - if the price reaches to $200 again, I can sell those 5 coins and I'm still in major profit.
People are basing their ROI on USD and not what BTC could be worth which is what we should start doing....but with that said, let's move away from BFL and stop giving them business. I'm sure if we all pooled our money together, we could easily manufacture USB miners. If 1GH/s is costing less than 0.37BTC, if ALOT more people contributed we could easily lower manufacturing costs. Personally I think the fact that the more you buy the cheaper it becomes is holding a lot of people who don't have the funding back...now if only someone would launch a crowdfunding project where we could buy a shit load of Avalon chips and PCB boards.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:12:25
From my point of view, Bitcoin won't be a real threat until there's a cheap way to cash to fiat.
MTGox require verification and p2p traders often think it's okay to charge huge excesses on top of marketprice to sell their coins while paying way below market to buy them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:10:22
This is what I mean. Instead of actual discussion you just decided to make a smarty pants comment. Sorry if I took it the wrong way but this is one of the posts that I think is failing the community. 
You can still make a profit by charging a % each way. I think charging above MTGox and below Bitstamp is a bit unfair.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:04:43
I'm sure people felt like this when the $290 -&gt; $110 crash happened. The golden rule is to not invest anything you can afford to lose and cash out at a time that you feel is acceptable.
For example, if BTC reaches $2000 and you cash out be happy that you made your initial investment back. You've still made a profit.

Check out the User-Agent and the IP address.
 
It's a TOR exit node.
Whatever is happening it isn't some kiddy who randomly decided to try and get into services. It's a lot bigger than that, using TOR to hide their identities and programming, probably to attempt to automate some services.

I wouldn't say it in that way.
The way I see it, the police are given training on how to catch cyber criminals. I personally believe you cannot train someone to catch people like this. You can't have people follow a set list of rules. You have to have people who actually understand what goes on behind each process, not some monkeys who will just repeat what they've been taught.
@_date: 2013-08-02 12:14:43
I'm actually in a very good mood. However it seems like you're hurt that your question was answered by yourself. First your sarcastic comment and now downvoting all my posts? That's lovely. :)
I think you should pay more attention to the things you buy and learn to read the terms and conditions then maybe you wouldn't have to worry about whether or not your BFL product will ship. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 11:09:59
Good idea - do you think you personally would benefit from a service where you were provided with say a Shell gift card and you could manage your account online? You pay in BTC and your card is refilled within 12 hours (but would usually be done instantly.)
@_date: 2013-09-24 14:06:56
Thank you - even the early adapter logic is stupid. If anything it just goes to show how real money is vulnerable to inflation. If you had $10 back in the day you'd be worse off now due to inflation. Using BTC as an example, if you had $10 back in the day you are now better off.

@_date: 2013-08-20 11:48:54
Always assume every point of access is vulnerable, especially with Bitcoins. What you're forgetting is that you are not actually in control of the Bitcoins. They are stored on a server that belongs to MTGox and their hosting company. It is vulnerable, to physical theft and damage. Let's assume for one second that the thief steals the server where the coins are stored. He may not be able to decrypt the wallet, but they are still not in your possession.
While 2FA is becoming a industry standard, you must never assume you are secure because there is always a weak point in your chain - usually human based that is susceptible to penetration. 
If you really want to keep your coins 100% safe, buy a small device such as a USB or Raspberry Pi, put your encrypted wallet on that device and then encrypt the storage device with something like Bitlocker or TrueCrypt - and never let that device connect to a machine with remote access. Always keep it offline. Then put the USB in a 10 ton safe.

ICANN which is like the domain name authority will ask the registrar to force you to verify your information by any needs possible if they get a complaint from someone.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:04:16
It's not fishy at all, it's following AML policy.
It's possible your BTC transfer triggered some alert, maybe you received coins from with traces from a known dodgy address.
Basically, don't use MTGOX if you're not willing to provide identification. Even if it is just for Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:34:28
@_date: 2013-08-21 09:10:53
Using a merchant service that converts the coins into fiat currency would be the only option. Unless the gov heavily regulates BTC (which would be impossible) - charities won't accept it simply because they need to have a level of transparency and Bitcoin doesn't provide that (in terms of actual individual identification)
@_date: 2013-08-02 13:16:35
I wasn't being sarcastic at all. I was reinforcing the point you made, and adding on that it's policy.
That eye-for-an-eye mentality doesn't work well.

I don't know why you got downvoted, everyone who cares about their BTC should be running everything on an isolated network. I'll probably get downvoted for this too but I honestly don't care lol. You have people in this community who complain about lack of Bitcoin security but won't implement their own protocols. 
I'm not saying the user is stupid, but please don't blame anyone but yourself if you fall for this kind of thing. This isn't LB's fault 100%, yes their inputs should have been sanitized, but you need to always assume then nothing is 100% safe.

Upovted but let's hold all judgement until we find out what's happening. We don't even know if it's their email system that's broken, it could be another part of the website that's affecting emails being sent out.
@_date: 2013-08-02 12:02:13


I may have done so but even then, OP asked 'I am just curious if fighting them is worth the effort.' I don't see the point of asking this question if their policy clearly states no refunds. No company is going to throw away potential money. 
In all honesty, I don't care but someone else might not find the sarcasm appreciative especially when they're trying to help.

@_date: 2013-08-02 12:06:31
It's not borderline illegal lol. You agreed to their terms and conditions and you knew it was a pre-order with potential delays. Find me any piece of official text from applicable law or from an official BFL statement saying that your order was guaranteed within x time frame. You were told that there would be delays, you could have asked for a refund before they started shipping.
@_date: 2013-08-02 10:34:11
You can't block a P2P network. You can take down the client but there will always be ways to bypass it. There's nothing stopping me from running a 100M RJ-45 cable to the next computer and the next computer runs another cable and so on and so on. Of course I'm just being silly, but you could achieve this with wireless technology. 
Look at Limewire. All it did was allow a GUI interface for people to connect to each other and share questionable files. They shut down the client because it was being abused, not because the actual concept was illegal. The same with Megaupload. It wasn't gone after because of the concept but because it enabled people to share copyrighted files. However the funny thing is we can apply that logic to almost every sort of file transmission protocol. People seem to forget, before the internet existed media was shared on physical copies. Floppies and CDs were passed with files that weren't 100% legit. The internet just made it easier.
The creator of The Pirate Bay said it the best. The current form of TBP must die so something greater can take it's place. In a way, when a service gets taken down it sort of works as evolution. Liberty Reserve was a great service, but because the company itself was dealing with fiat currency it forgot to get the correct paperwork dealt with. That was it's downfall. Bitcoin itself doesn't have to deal with that, but the companies using the protocol do. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:03:42
It makes me sad that the one ASIC company that delivered decided to pull this kind of stunt :( as if they weren't happy with the $10 million in pre-orders they used the products to make the network harder to mine on and then do something like this.
Don't get me wrong, the BTC concept is great and I love it but it's things like this that would probably put newcomers off. All this shows is that some people in the BTC community are just in it for the profit rather than setting up some kind of legacy. We have an amazing concept on our hands that we should pass onto the next generation but instead everyone just cares about the money.
The world banks have started to regulate BTC, were not just a crazy fad now. We are on the possible verge of changing how we pay for things. No more making money off credit card interest when people are barely getting by etc but instead we will probably fuck it up by 
A) Scaring away new people to the system.
B) Thinking about profit rather than what we create for the future.
It's already happening, everyone is ALWAYS shouting about how USB miners won't have a ROI - yeah in BTC they won't. They always say 'Hold onto your coins, that'll make more profit'.....it's not about the profit. It's about owning a certain amount of hash power that would be 10x the cost with something like a GPU, it's about decentralizing the network even more so there is even less chance of a network owning 51% of the power. Can you imagine if the miners dropped to something like $10? You could offer them as freebies with your products, and all they have to do is plug it in when their PC is up. Your protecting the network as well. WHat if BTC goes up like it did last time? Your 0.05 coins that you mined will have paid itself off for it. I'd understand if you were dropping something like $10k on a miner but you're not, it's less than a $100 and it's a novelty. 
I love BTC and what it holds for the future but god damn it sometimes humans can be stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:08:12
Thank you =)
I do agree, most of the time it's like "omg $500" and I'm just sitting there thinking....okay great, how does this help the cause? BTC could have been at $0.10 and still had the same effect. Last price is just what people were willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-08-21 11:39:53
That's a good idea - it somehow leans towards a Reddit style model where you get upvoted with Bitcoins but I have the feeling a pay-to-view / read model may fail.
However, if we somehow figured out how to obtain rights to certain media we could very well launch a marketplace that takes BTC for media. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:53:24
This is it. Literally one line of code and you get a new address, or you can easily force a new address. No problem with verification as the right code will ensure your server verifies payment and what not.
Alternatively, use a merchant service like Coinbase.

No real point &amp; I do apologize, it is a bit messy. It was just a collection of thoughts I wanted to get out. I mean we have this great system in place with so much potential and it just feels like it's going to waste because people are constantly thinking short term.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:03:25
I said this a while ago and have been saying it for a while. When you have a decentralized protocol like Bitcoin, it comes with problems. You don't get the features that are promised to you without some kind of sacrifice on your side. It's as simple as that, you either have great convenience or give up a bit of your time and get out of your comfort zone in order to ensure your security. 
Web wallets are exactly that, you are trusting someone else to hold your money (your private key) on their server. It's the same as handing someone your physical wallet. While what has been said below is true, the fact is you can never assume that a server is 100% safe. The same way banks can't be trusted 100% either. If someone inside the bank wants to steal your money, they'll do it, regardless of consequences. Consequences don't matter, if someone wants to break a rule they'll do it. 
So as said below, your private key is the thing you need to keep safe. The only way you can do this is if the person who is looking after your private key makes sure not even physical access to the server would cause a breach of it or if you personally look after it yourself. Of course this doesn't stop the actual theft of it, it just means the thief wasted his time.

Interesting. Thanks for the explanation, always wondered why someone with a million dollars or something just didn't invest inside it.
