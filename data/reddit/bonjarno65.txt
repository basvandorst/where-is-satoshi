False dichotomy
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:45:47
You're wrong - the outcomes are the same. Japan and Canada have longer life expectancies. Shopping around is a stupid idea - who the fuck is gonna shop when they just broke their leg or just heard they have cancer? How can you shop for a product if you don't know what kind of treatment you'll need? It's a stupid idea really, but its good for insurance companies. Glad to see you're on their side fool. 
Fact: we pay 2x the price for healthcare than Japan and Canada. We pay more cause we can't collectively bargain for lower prices. Idiot 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:21:27
It’s not me that thinks it’s best - the evidence clearly shows lower prices for similar coverage over seas - that’s what many healthcare professionals and statisticians and economists have found. 
Basically you want to live in a fancy neighborhood (I.e. the USA) and not be forced to pay the price of upkeep. Everyone must pay to keep things in order. 
If you don’t like participating, move to the ghetto (I.e a third world nation). There there is no public healthcare, education, or police. Everything is opt in.

Dang your friend can lose 200K? I wish I could do that
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:18:52
Your facts are wrong. Cancer survivability rates are higher in other countries with universal healthcare: 
Which makes sense - because there people don’t have to sell their homes to get treatment. The allocation of healthcare is far more efficient. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:04:52
Socialism doesn't scale, but healthcare and education for everyone does. Thats why swedes don't have to go into debt to pay for healthcare and we do in the USA. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:55:10
If it’s snobby to think evidence of efficiency is what matters in government resources then I am the biggest snob in the world - you’re still dumb and ideological though 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:09:41
Lol having the most advanced healthcare centers has (almost) nothing to do with survivability of cancer for the average American vs average British person. The survivability is higher in the UK for some cancers. You’re really dumb. 
Again: The British, Canadians, and literally almost every other 1st country pay upto 50% less for healthcare, with better lifespans and similar health outcomes. Those are facts.  
Click the link I shared above and observe the cancer survivability rates in different countries, as reported by the Center for Disease Control. Dumbass!

Lol I’ve spent my entire life studying scientific falsifiability (literally - I have a doctorate in physics). 
Here you go - an entire chapter covering the relationship between investment in public education and economic growth: 
Again: taxes to pay for education, among other things, lead to more wealth for you based on evidence. No man is an island. Quit whining 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:04:56
I agree that taxes shouldn’t pay for wars. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t pay for  healthcare, education, etc. This is why our country sucks - a lack of nuanced critical thinking and civic duty is making us a laughing stock.

So slick - Putin can say he “won” future elections to the Russian people, when all he really did was rig the block chain. Most people probably don’t know blockchain tech can be rigged. 
It also gives him complete centralized, unalterable data/control of Russian citizens. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:41:00
Exact same argument applies. You and everyone else have benefited tremendously from public services. Taxes pay for those services. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:29:51
Evidence is evidence. You’re not entitled to your own facts sir 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:46:17
Not contradictory statements 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:12:29
Part 2: there is plenty of evidence that for-profit education is awful. Just compare Devry “University” to University of California, Los Angeles or literally any other state school. UCLA costs a fraction of what Devry costs and has far better outcomes. 
The incentive for for-profit education is perverse- recruit as many people as possible, saddle them with debt, pay teachers as little as possible, provide as few benefits to students as possible.
Some things are better for the public sector, and if you ditch free market ideology and look at evidence, you will understand this. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:52:03
A teacher paid for by taxes taught you to read and write so you can be on the internet complaining. Appreciate it, quit whining, and pay your taxes. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:48:49
No but I do prefer to have certain services be government funded from my taxes, rather than from in-efficient and in-expensive corporations
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:44:24
I wonder how he plans to control it - the dude loves centralized control and blockchain is all about decentralization so I don't get it 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:47:07
Yes - also call your rep, donate, campaign, share on Facebook, March, and protest and organize. That’s what will change it if you don’t like it 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:25:11
Yeah that private school didn’t treat you well cause you’re still ignorant. An educated workforce generates far more wealth than a non educated one - just compare the USA (or any other western country) salaries and those in Nigeria. Paying for others’ education directly leads to a bigger pay check for you. Dumbass. 
Again: we don’t have a sense of civic duty in this country anymore. It’s why the rest of the 1st world has long since left us behind in terms of living and education standards for the average person. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:27:48
I don’t want to pay extra - that’s why I want my healthcare to be half price - with the same outcomes - like it is in Germany and Canada and everywhere else with an ounce of common sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:44:39
Harvard is private but it also non profit and also very expensive. Public schools are not as good but far far less expensive. Public schools are still more efficient. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:23:57
It's totally falsifiable. There are tons of studies showing investing in education leads to an educated workforce that creates wealth for everyone. 
The best analogy for taxes is a mortgage. If you like your nice, crime-free neighborhood, pay your mortgage. Otherwise, move to the ghetto (i.e. a 3rd world nation) - there the mortgage will be super cheap, and you don't have to pay for clean streets or police or the local school - cause they won't exist.

The vote for funding the TSA and all those other things come ma through your rep in Senate and House. If you don’t like your reps, vote them out
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:32:22
Says the dude who drives on roads paid for by taxes, streets cleaned by taxes, lives in a safe neighborhood due to police paid by taxes, got atleast 12 years of free education paid by taxes... 
Quit whining - if you don’t want to be forced to pay taxes then stop using public services and move to Nigeria - where there are no public services and no taxes. 
TLDR: it costs $$ to have a civil society you idiot.  Don’t like it? Move to a 3rd world nation. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:22:12
I literally said there are peer reviews, scientific sociology studies based in statistical and experimental methods showing that investing in education is beneficial for society. Do you want to see the peer reviewed research? 
It’s because of that research that I advocate for you to quit whining and pay your taxes - cause things that benefit the public benefit you (and me and everyone). 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:52:52
Duh 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:42:48
I meant the current wars. It’s totally fine to think “taxes should pay for things I like” that’s why there’s a vote. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:50:38
You’re both dumb. The fact is some things are more efficiently done in the public sector, and that includes roads. Efficiency of allocation of resources is a measurable thing - no ideology necessary. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:05:56
Ah I get your problem - you didn’t understand the generic argument I am making. Again, for the (probably) fifth time: investment in public education creates a an educated workforce that produces wealth for everyone. It doesn’t matter if you, your mom or your entire family went to private school. So quit whining. 
I provided evidence for this claim using the links of an entire chapter of a book from the World Bank - though there is way way more evidence than that.
