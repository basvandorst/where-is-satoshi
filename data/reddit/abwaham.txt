My guess is you were not around in may/june.  The market may have changed, but it may not have

You're not a good swing trader

If atomic swaps over lightning become a thing transactions can be settled on a variety of blockchains. Wouldn't require a block size increase necessarily

Bought my first btc there.  Worked well

Of course its speculation, it just seems logical that this is what will occur.  It will be much harder to adopt BTC as a currency or store of value if it continues going through 80% retracements.  
I was using the analogy of a sine wave, for which frequency and amplitude are the correct terms.  I felt like it illustrated my point, I am not trying to say that the price curve is a sine wave (although it sort of is).

Litecoin is manipulated to the fullest IMO.  Its not a pump and dump coin, ownership is so centralised that the P+Ds cant have the effects they do in other markets.   However the very obvious sell and buy walls have kept it in an extremely narrow channel for months now.  
A few whales have been riding LTC for BTC profits since the early part of the year, and Im sure it has made a couple of people extraordinarily wealthy

I have probably spent far too long looking at diagrams like this but my opinion differs slightly from these projections.  I cant see a future BTC going through 80-90% retracements as user base and adoption picks up.  Each cycle increases the number of long term hodlers and the confidence that BTC wont collapse or disappear.  Also more people trying to profit by selling the tops and buying the bottoms limiting the size of the swings.
The future that I think is more likely is that volatility will decrease and the cycles will become faster and smaller.  Logically this probably has to happen if BTC is going to be adopted as a global medium of exchange and/or store of value.
To put it in scientific terms the amplitude of price variations will decrease and the frequency increase.
Just my 2c.

Never short BTC

Both BCH pumps have occurred with heavy South Korean volume. This is not to say that South Koreans are the perpetrators, just that their exchanges were used.
My guess would be that this was Chinese coin being traded at massive volume.  Data dash showed the scale of money flowing through Bithumb et al during the attack in his video while it occurred, unfortunately I cant find any way to show this data here.

Haha that's true. I hope they lost a lot of money. Burned fingers are a potent reminder.

Litecoin is one of my largest holdings. I was just commenting on the price action this year. As the de facto testnet for btc, ltc has the best chance for serious adoption compared to most coins. At its current price point though it can fall prey to well resourced individual actors imho.

Lightning requires you to be online all the time otherwise you endanger your channel. This device would be plug and play and maintain your lightning channels for bitcoin, litecoin and vertcoin. It would also allow you to securely access your funds with your phone or other verified device.

It's ok to not understand things. You should be less hard on yourself
