Thank you, bob!
EDIT: Man that Trezor is expensive. But that's the price of security, right? :)

How does this site guarantee that the private key I was generated isn't in use by someone else? It seems like it was stochastically generated, which has a non-0 probability of just being a duplicate of someone else's, right?

I asked another user this, but how do these private key generators guarantee that I don't receive a duplicate of someone else's? Maybe I'll just look up a paper wallet guide.
Thanks again for all the help!

As silly as it seems, I was only just convinced to plunge into Bitcoin due to the news about the Coinbase Exchange. That and the ridiculously generous folks here did a ChangeTip initiative, which seriously helped me in drinking the Kool-Aid.
I have created a Coinbase account with a ludicrously long password that is easy to remember, but I don't intend to keep my money there. When I purchase BTC through Bitcoin, I will then immediately move it to a vault (is that colloquially how it's referred to?). This is where things fall apart for me.
I'd like to have a wallet that is essentially offline, for long term storage, and one accessible from my phone. I understand how these interfaces are all just essentially private keys, but there appears to be some perks to keeping some of it online, such as the ability to even spend it. Should I just keep online money with Coinbase and choose some other methodology for offline storage? Does anyone have a suggestion for the latter?
