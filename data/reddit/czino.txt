Your math is a bit off. You need just as much as there are currently if you don't own any. 
If you just get 1.11 million you add to the overall hash power and only get 1/3 of the total hash power.
So you need at least 2.22 million ant miners or 2.22 billion USD (not counting setup and electricity cost as well as some other fixed costed like maintaining a building and employees)
Unless you buy out other farms or already own a big part of the total hash power. But this is where math gets a bit trickier.

Maybe people who fall for it deserve to get there money stolen but I don't think so. And it's fun to waste a scammers time to discourage them from doing so

So let's say I bought 0.01 BTC for 60$ at a price of 6000$ in the morning and then go grocery shopping. While I shop I see that BTC is now worth 6600$ and I think: "Cool I can buy groceries for 66$".
Then I spend all my 0.01 BTC at the checkout.
Do I now have to proof that I "sold" my BTC at a 10% profit? But I already paid taxes on the food, how do they account in?

Please take a step back and look how the price moved on a broader scale.
The market goes down for 100 days after going up for around 900 days, I would not call the future very dim just yet.

I just think it's still too early to tell, but of course the situation should be reevaluated on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.
