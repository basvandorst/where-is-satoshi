I get your point. You, and many others, like the things taxes pay for. So that would mean you have an incentive to pay your taxes. That's perfectly consistent with my comment.


I disagree with that. I don't expect anyone to be forced to give away part of their income.

Perhaps. I don't know. Last time I checked (a long time ago), the main Bitcoin client created an unencrypted wallet, so I haven't used it for that reason. But that's probably changed by now. I don't know. Hopefully someone else can answer.

You are backing up the access to the bitcoin addresses currently in your wallet, even with coins that were added after the backup.
So if you back up, and then receive money at a *new* address, that won't be counted in the backup. Some clients do tricky things, such as creating new 'change' addresses without making it clear, so I think it is a good idea to make another backup anyway.

Why do you need to be verified to use Mt Gox?

Did you sort this out?

Or better yet: buy bitcoins with them. :)

Interesting. If there is an S curve for the market share percentage, the BTCUSD pair is equivalent to the ratio of one market share divided by another.
Where S(t) is Bitcoin's market share, assuming only two competing currencies, and S(t) being an S curve S(t)  = S(final)/(1+e^{-x}):
- value of 1 BTC = total currency market * S(t) / number of bitcoins existing
- value of 1 USD = total currency market * (1-(S(t))) / number of dollars existing
So the BTCUSD price would be the ratio of those.
And that still turns out to be an S curve, although it levels off at a later time than the adoption curve:
(I don't know much about this, so I might be wrong)

a tyranny of the majority.

Yeah. In some ways, changes in currency have already changed the way they do taxes. E.g., the Euro created a situation where there wasn't the option of an inflation tax, so they had to simply steal directly from bank accounts.
But I don't think governments will be very imaginative - they will try to cling to the status quo way of taxation, probably right up until taxation completely disappears.

I was hoping not to see this, but I'm glad it's opposed. If this is used, it will abused so much, and it doesn't actually help victims of a crime anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:59:19
Ok. What's your point?
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:45:25
I store mine on blockchain.info also, with an encrypted backup on dropbox.
The advantage is that I can easily spend them, and it is easy to use and has a nice interface.
The disadvantage is that I think (and please correct me if I'm wrong) they could change their website at any time to just make it steal my coins they next time I log in.... I'm hoping that they don't do that. But it's still safer than putting your money in a bank where the government can snatch it at any time.

The good thing about Bitcoin is that people can decide for themselves whether or not they want to pay taxes. When it's a good idea to pay taxes (e.g. if you buy a house) people will pay. But when it's a bad idea, people have a strong incentive not to pay, and so they shouldn't pay.
Governments already hate Bitcoin so they will try to put a strain on merchants anyway. Taxes make little to no difference there.
Bitcoin lets you avoid having your money stolen by governments, and would be pretty stupid to ignore that opportunity.

You mean 1 satoshi is one 100,000,000th of a bitcoin.

Nothing at all happens? Not even an error message? Maybe try using Chrome instead (if you aren't already)?

I'm selfish for not wanting to force people to pay taxes?
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:07:58
I completely agree.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:48:19
Try going to blockchain.info/wallet/yourwalletidentifierhere maybe?
I'm no expert at this though.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:07:58
Blockchain.info has an email function. If they don't accept the coins, then they go back to the sender I believe.

My understanding is that Zeitgeist supporters want a centralised, moneyless, economy without any private exchange. Bitcoin is a decentralized form of money, designed to facilitate exchange - the complete opposite.
However, they claim to be non-violent and in favour of technology, so some may like it.
