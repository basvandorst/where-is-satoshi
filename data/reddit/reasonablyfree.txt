That's not intrinsic value. Nothing has intrinsic value. It's subjective. That sandwich has no value to someone who is on a hunger strike.

Not at all new to fractional reserve. But if the banks are already minimizing excess reserves, if the amount of resources loaned increases without a corresponding increase in resources saved, you're going to end up with a lot of misallocation of resources.

I'm not sure about European banks. You're absolutely right about the U.S. banks, but of course that's an historical anomaly.

Keeping money in a savings account is not "holding cash." The money in a savings account is money that savers have deferred spending and loaned to the bank so that the bank can loan it to borrowers who wish to use it to, say, start a new business or build property. Circulation of the money doesn't stop. Savings isn't a black hole where money can't escape.
Negative interest rates on savings actually would *encourage* the public to hold liquid cash instead of depositing it and allowing it to be loaned out. At least the mattress doesn't charge 0.25% interest.

Food doesn't have intrinsic value either. Go to the Muslim world and see how much value a ham sandwich has.

Why would anyone want to punish savers? Do they not realize that you need savers to have borrows? Otherwise you're lending resources that do not exist. Saving is deferred spending.
