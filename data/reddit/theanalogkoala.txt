But you cant leave your backup deadman switch with your lawyer. He will steal it. You need to leave a small trinket with your lawyer who will give it to your only daughter for sentimental value. 
But on the trinket it will say “where all the ants go run run run” and then the number 108. This will trigger deep memories in your daughter. She will go to the family crypt outside of which she used to play with the anthills. She will go to niche 108 and the epitaph will say “love never dies”. Then she will see a space on the concrete block that fits the trinket. On pressing it in, the wall will shift revealing a stone staircase. She will go down, finding a musty office full of maps, books, papers, all your research on the occult and a variety of ancient and modern weapons. She will play the video marked “play me” and learn you are likely trapped on a tropical island ruled by a madman name Dr. Laurent. Your daughter will learned to use the weapons during a dramatic montage and, using the BTC fortune you left her, she will travel to the island with a ragtag bunch of ex Army Rangers and free you, after a fierce battle, in which you appear to be shot down. 
Then you all return to the US and you realize that you’re not dead after all but now your secret life is exposed and you don’t have any more BTC because your daughter used it in your rescue. Sucks.

I know the Austrians that hang around here disagree, but the economy of the 1800s was extremely chaotic in large part due to lack of the right kinds of regulation.

Sorry just saw this. Spending doesn’t affect the price (yet) because there is so little spending. 
Tracking  volume is hard. Many of the exchanges shift coins amongst themselves by painting the tape and doing wash sales (basically self dealing to affect price). Bitcoin is not regulated so these things that are illegal in securities trading happen all the time in Bitcoin. 
It is very hard to know the true volume (i.e fiat being exchanged for bitcoin) and that is part of why volatility is so high. There just aren’t a ton of transactions.

You know, I think this forum is strengthened when we exchange different ideas and opinions. I have a different opinion than you do so now I'm a hater and a "little B". I know you would prefer this forum to be a hyper-positive echo chamber to soothe your fears regarding the price of Bitcoin, but there are others here that actually value the free expression of ideas. Please, you can do better than insulting people who disagree with you.
First of all, I agree with you that Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme. I never said it was. I said it had a characterisitic of a Ponzi scheme. 
You've now twice said that new money is needed for the price to rise. A Ponzi scheme gives high returns by paying off early investors with the investments of later investors. This is what is happening in Bitcoin. It isn't a Pozni scheme because a Ponzi has other characteristics that Bitcoin does not share. So it seems we are in agreement. 
If you're having trouble following me, consider this analogy. If I say "Dinosaurs had feathers, which are a characterisitic of birds", and you said "I don't believe dinosaurs are birds, dinosaurs are REPTILES you little B", then you would be lacking reading comprehension and making yourself look like a fool.
I sincerely hope the price spikes and you are able to find someone to take you out of your position so you can get a Lambo. I really do.

An hour ago I looked at a thread about how difficult it is to safely pass bitcoin to your heirs. One comment suggested encasing a USB stick with your private key into concrete in your floor (a la John Wick, I guess). If your money is in a brokerage account they just pass it on for you when you die.
Yesterday I read a thread about a guy who lost more than 3 BTC getting phished while hooking up his Trezor. Sure, he screwed up, but a centralized bank would just refund his money. Last year I got my identity stolen down in Austin. I just got new credit cards and after 30 minutes on the phone got my money back. 
So, not feeling this meme. Sure the banking system has its problems but BTC is creating different ones while it solves others.

100% pay the tax. Avoiding it is like picking up dollar bills in front of a steamroller. It isn't worth it.
The cost basis thing is tricky. If you know roughly when you made the purchases of the BTC then you can look at historical prices to estimate the cost basis. Since you don't have documentation be prepared that the IRS may disallow the cost basis and calculate it from $0. I would advise you to keep enough cash to pay this additional tax if requested. If the bitcoin is old, the difference in tax between $0 and what you paid is probably small. Might be better to just claim $0 (although that depends of course on your situation).
If you have any newer bitcoin it would be better to sell that (especially if you can document the purchase). If you have any bitcoin that has lost money, it may be even better to sell that. You don't have to worry about kicking up any wash sale questions because the regulations on crypto wash sales have not yet been clarified by the IRS.
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:16:54
Yeah, the IRS won't care. Make sure you fill in a schedule D when you do your tax return this year, and make an early payment if you expect to owe a lot because the one thing to watch out for is if you need to pay a lot of tax along with your return you can actually get a penalty for underpayment. 
To avoid that, you need to make the capital gains payment from your bitcoin sale in the quarter you make the sale, don't just wait until you do your taxes next year. Here is a helpful link: [

I'm sorry your friend ran into financial trouble and chose to take his own life. That is terrible. I wish he could have held on until things get better. I don't see how I'm being judgmental. Your friend made the best decisions he could given the information he had. But it doesn't follow that the 401k plan is a tool of the "banksters" and is economic slavery.
If your friend needed the money from his 401k to stave off foreclosure or pay medical bills that would be a hardship withdrawal and would be without penalty. If it was for other bills he could have taken a 72t early distribution penalty free. Why didn't he set up a 72t distribution schedule? Unfortunately it looks like he paid the early withdrawal penalty unnecessarily. 
The early withdrawal penalty is there to discourage people from using the money unwisely, but there are mechanisms built into it (such as the 72t) to help people who run into trouble. Maybe your friend didn't research his plan before he withdrew the money, so the IRS just charged him the penalty.
And, for the record, I understand 2008 very well. I also lost my job (in 2009, though). I had enough of an emergency fund to see me through until I got another job. I was lucky in that it only took me about 6 months to find new work.
But the point of my comment wasn't to attack your friend, it was to question if a program put in place to encourage retirement savings somehow makes the users slaves. I disagree. If you think that using a 401k means turning over title to your money, then don't use it. But all the rules and regulations are public so I think it weakens your point to use so much hyperbole.

If you define durability as "something that is not easily destroyed" then Bitcoin needs some work here. It is way too easy to lose your keys and then the value is essentially destroyed. 
I would add that good money needs to be easy to use. Bitcoin is not easy to use in any way, shape, or form.
I think this is why in part a lot of people are backing away from the currency angle and moving more towards "store of value"
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:48:19
So the government sets up a plan (401k) that lets  you defer taxes until retirement on a small amount of money each year, which is often matched somewhat. 
Your friend loses his job. He doesn't have enough emergency funds so he withdraws from his 401k. The government makes him pay the taxes he would have if he hadn't used the 401k at all plus a 10% penalty. 
That's economic slavery?

I agree the rigs will be more efficient in time, so yes, at a fixed hash rate they will use less power in the future. However, two points. First mining rigs are already highly optimized and the power the rate of efficiency gains you’ll get from just waiting (essentially Moore’s Law) is declining. Some people here thing Moore’s Law is a physical law rather than an observation. It’s slowing down. I’m in the electronics business and the consolidation in the industry the last 10 years, the increased interest in open-source hardware, and the rise of system houses (Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and so on) doing their own silicon is testament to Moore’s Law grinding to a halt. 
Also, imagine I’m totally wrong and someone invents a mining rig that uses 1% of the power of current rigs at a given hashrate. Electricity is a major cost of mining, so this is equivalent to saying this rig would reduce the cost of mining. Then new miners would show up as there would be more profit to be had. The new miners would increase the hashrate. Then, the network would increase the difficulty until the cost to mine went up until it met demand. This is how the network defends itself and is why proof of work is inherently power inefficient.

That's true, and that is what makes me nervous to be honest.

There are other options. It could keep bouncing around for years between 2000 and 20000 or so as whales convert their stacks into fiat and ransomware criminals sell off their ill gotten gains. Eventually something else might become the speculative vehicle. Then it would grind down as hodlers and true believers slowly give up. I think it could go down to hundreds but not zero. It does have uses. 
It could moon. I think this is much less likely than you do. It would require the transaction bottlenecks to be resolved (LN is not viable yet) and it would require some method of making it user friendly for people who don’t want the risk of being their own bank. It would also require the largest wealth transfer in history from very powerful people to people who haven’t traditionally had power. This would be unprecedented and painful. 
It could also settle on an intermediate price given long term demand. With so much speculation and manipulation no one really has a feel for the actual organic demand. 
No one knows what is going to happen. I think the odds of a 100X gain are a lot less than 1 in 2, but that’s just my opinion. In fact I would bet a significant amount of money it never hits 100k 
When people give reasons for why it will moon (for example if it replaces gold) they usually gloss over that extremely powerful people will have a huge incentive to make sure that doesn’t happen. If bitcoin moons it will only be after a world war.

As someone in the industry I respectfully disagree. Moore’s Law is almost done as performance is power constrained rather than device speed constrained.  In terms of density we have a few more generations to go but the improvements now are typically reduced cost in large volumes, not performance. The trend is now application specific computing but bitcoin has already gone down that road. 
A computer from 5 years ago is still pretty high end. I’m the 90s a high end computer from five years earlier was practically junk.
Edit: the Wikipedia link you gave actually agrees with me that Moore’s Law is slowing down.

The fourth sentence of the introduct to Satoshi’s white paper states: “The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions... “
Easily spendable money was literally Satioshi’s second justification for Bitcoin! He obviously meant micropayments for “small casual transactions” because they are not well served by credit card companies and in the introduction he is describing commercial internet commerce systems (i.e. credit cards)
The digital gold / private money idea was part of it but only in the last few years has the public seized on it once Bitcoin got popular enough to bog down the system.

It doesn't fit it perfectly (in my opinion), but they share a lot of characteristics (for now). Basically, a Ponzi has a head, while this is decentralized. There isn't anyone steering the ship (although there is a cartel manipulating).
For me the scariest thing is so many moonboys on here buy Bitcoin with the only exit strategy is to hold until number go up. That will work until it doesn't, and using it as speculation vehicle makes it useless for most other uses.

Yes of course I know the difference. However, the way bitcoin is being used as a medium for speculation has real parallels with a Ponzi scheme. It's not a Ponzi, but shares some characteristics (not inherently, but the way it is used).
Bitcoin has a solid long-term use case and technology but I think it threatened existentially by speculation. Everyone is focused on "number go up" and it is virtually unused except to speculate. It is far, far to volatile to be used as a currency and its price should be irrelevant, however with it constantly going up and down 50% it is useless at the moment.
My real concern is that this speculation and get-rich-quick sentiment is going to be what destroys bitcoin.

Spoiler alert, it’s not. I’ve thought about it a lot and I can’t think of a scenario where it moons. Sure, it can still stick around and be valuable but moon?
Even if the planet decides to move to cryptocurrency what do you think the odds are that the governments of the world will hand over the largest wealth transfer in history to a bunch of cypher punks, John birch types and money launderers.

Over the last couple of hundred years real estate has more or less tracked inflation, and stock investments have beaten inflation by a large margin over time. Meaning, $1000 in 1970 invested in real estate or stocks would have more purchasing power today. 
The “central bank robs us blind” thing is only correct if you “invest” in cash, and that would be stupid. 
Bitcoin has a lot going for it but I wish it wasn’t associated with Austrian economics and the John Birch society. I think we would get more traction and be better off if we weren’t obsessed with the Fed.

Slippery slope? Bitcoin is the most manipulated investment I can think of. You can profit from that but if you ignore it you may be in for a world of hurt.

Good analysis but I have to disagree that that mining rigs will become vastly more efficient for a couple of reasons. 
First, the hashing function is specifically designed to be resistant to simplification. In essence a miner generates random numbers and checks to see if they are smaller than some threshold. The difficulty adjusts with hashtags by moving the threshold. There is no shortcut (if their were bitcoin wouldn’t be secure). 
The low-hanging fruits for efficiency (general purpose CPU —&gt; GPU —&gt; ASIC) have already been picked, and with Moore’s law almost done the future possible gains are real but limited (in other words most of the efficiency gains are behind us).  
Also, the difficulty adjusts with the hashrate. So, if magical super efficient mining rigs showed up the difficulty would moon and we would kind of be back where we started. 
The interesting part of your TED talk is about TX fees. Presumably they will moon as fewer coins are awarded. Also are you saying miners may be propping up the price by not selling coins? How are they paying their expenses? Investment?

The hard part is the odds of bitcoin going up 100X are unknown. Certainly it would require a lot more adoption.

Technology generations are still happening at a reduced rate but the benefit we are seeing from each new node is decreasing. Going from 180nm to 90nm was a much, much bigger deal from a performance standpoint than 22nm to 11nm is. 
As the device shrinks, the gate oxide thickness is reduced to keep a constant electric field. This means tunneling current greatly increases the power dissipation as smaller feature sizes are used. People have used different materials for the gate dielectric (for example moving from SiO2 to HfO2) but that only partially mitigates the problem. 
Semiconductor power has two components, static and dynamic. More advanced technologies have more leakage (tunnel current) but traditionally less dynamic power due to reduced capacitance. This isn’t the case anymore as interconnect rather than device performance is limiting the power reduction you used to get for free by shrinking.
I spend a lot of my time worrying about power dissipation. There will not be vast improvements in power efficiency in mining rigs as long as we are still using silicon.

That's a bold, bold statement without a lot of evidence. In fact the vast amount of manipulation and scams surrounding Bitcoin suggest otherwise.

I'm curious. If the price goes sideways for six months will you then say "It's a volatile asset that is down massively this year"?

You may not have meant it this way, but your comment could be interpreted as you think Bitcoin is a religion where you are happy to wait forever for something that will never happen.

I guarantee that most people are here to get rich even if they claim to be here for ideology or the technology. 
Hodling does nothing to promote bitcoin and is merely rent seeking behavior. The people who truly believe in bitcoin as more than a get rich quick scheme are using it and trying to find new ways to use it, not just sit on it.

Not a great analogy. So I guess fiat is collapsing, then recovering 40% in a few weeks, then collapsing again, then recovering and so on?
Bitcoin is way more volatile than fiat.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:07:00
But it’s inflationary for the next century. More are mined everyday.

But a stock does indeed have tangible value. The book value of a company is the value of everything it owns (equipment, furniture, inventory, real estate and on) minus its debts. If the market cap of a company falls below book value then often a private “vulture capital” firm will buy it, and you will receive money for your stock. 
Saying a company has no value beyond mass psychology is nuts. Surely many stocks are above this value (since the price bakes in expectations) but stocks absolutely have value.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:44:38
And it’s lost half its value over the last two years, which is also insane. Bitcoin is volatile.

It's impossible to know since it's a nonlinear system. One the one hand, the actual traded volume is incredibly thin so it wouldn't take much to make the price spike. One the other hand, though, as the price goes up people will come out of the woodwork liquidating their holdings. This in a nutshell is why Bitcoin is so volatile. If there was a huge influx of investment it would cause even wilder swings but it wouldn't take anywhere near a trillion to get the price to 75k. It took only tens or 100s of millions or a few billions (depending on who's analysis you believe) to swing bitcoin to 20k in 2017. There is so much shenanigans related to volume (because this is an unregulated market) that it is impossible to know how much real money changes hands. But, that said, it would be far, far less than a trillion to get to 75k coins.

For such a prophet he didn’t seem to know that Moore’s law was already grinding to a halt when he wrote this. We just bought a new compute server and it’s 10% faster than the one it replaced from 7 years ago.

They don’t completely control the economy but they completely control the currency. If you can’t pay taxes in bitcoin you’re forced to convert to fiat.

You may be waiting a very long time. The John Birch Society was formed in 1958 and we've been expecting the collapse of the monetary system "any day now" since about then.
Also, how does a monetary system that would concentrate wealth even more than it is concentrated today make the world a more peaceful and sustainable place? Genuinely curious about your perspective.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:58:02
That’s just not true. Bitcoin is highly concentrated in a few early adopters. A very small percentage of people are holding the lions share.

I think you missed his point. If TA worked and everyone did it, any benefit would be nullified and it would be reduced to luck. 
Very few professional fund managers can beat the market consistently. TA is no different.

Your equation makes no sense. The three parameters you use have no clear relation whatsoever to the value of bitcoin. You assert without a shred of evidence a quantitative relationship to them. I can play too:
Price of bitcoin = % of bitcoin held by whales x new money in the market (in millions US$) / number of exchange hacks in last three months. 
My equation is utterly meaningless. Like yours.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:40:11
Of course. Close to a 10% rise in one day is totally not manipulation. Totally.

Given that Bakkt was going to be a reality "really, really soon" for at least the last year, don't you think they would have done this before?

Quantum computing would likely break bitcoin. The algorithm could be modified to resist a quantum attack but that would require consensus and there is little reason bitcoin would win over a bespoke a “quantum coin” that is designed for quantum procession from the ground up. 
If some tech were developed to greatly reduce power dissipation in digital circuits it would probably be very good for bitcoin, but there isn’t really anything like that on the horizon. There are many potential solutions but all seem far away from practice.

This is messed up. Now you’re on the hook for something completely out of your control. She is dumb to invest her future in something she knows nothing about and she is cruel for putting the responsibility on you. 
This is a screwed up relationship dynamic and I think you are part of the problem. At the very least you need to make sure she understands what she is doing and accepts half the responsibility.

First off, you carry the burden to support your own assertions. Not me. The issue isn’t the number you chose. It’s that the mathematical relationship you present is not supported in any way by evidence. 
When you make a bold assertion (such as your equation has any meaning), it is your responsibility to support it. It is NOT the responsibility of those who question its validity to support themselves.

I don’t understand your comment about my second paragraph. Could you please eloborare on my misunderstanding?
And the reason I’m more concerned about quantum attacks than you are is the extreme subtlety of quantum algorithms. I’m not super confident developers will be able to secure an existing codebase. The stakes would be so high (if a practical quantum computer ever comes to pass). Of course that is just an opinion based on experience.

It is possible to design electronics to run at a few degrees (liquid Helium temp) or a little below. But there are a few problems. 
You typically use dilution refrigerators to get that cold. They can only dissipate a few 10s of nanowatts so the amount of computation you could do is minimal. Probably less than needed to mine Bitcoin. 
People have designed supercomputers at liquid nitrogen temperature (roughly -200 C) but it is likely the costs of doing this and the energy required to cool would greatly exceed the benefit. 
It is true that electronics get faster as you cool down until you reach a point called “freeze out” and then they go slowly if they work at all. 
The alternative is to use superconducting logic and a few degrees kelvin. It is fast but not capable of running the mining algorithm (device density not good enough).
