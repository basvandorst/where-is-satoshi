Well you have the fruits of your rudeness. Hope they're sweet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:41:09
Lol, sure.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:54:51
Well now I want to upvote. Guess I was snarky too.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:13:22
And we are all colored shocked
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:56:28
Welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:46:12
Because of your snarky title, yeah have a downvote.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:38
Can't dethrone the Doge, but definitely a solid addition to the team.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:03:12
Yes you do, if you look closer. His change was not implemented. What Core is doing is not what he spoke about.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:14
Yes, yes he was. Get your info outside this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:05:08
Yep. But let's keep burying our heads in the sand, right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:06:22
Core didn't want a currency, they wanted something to hold value.
Ta-da! The votes that users made with their wallets(sticking to Core) are simply bearing their fruit.
This isn't unexpected.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:06:50
Because Core
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:28:35
What about the recent fees?
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:05:18
Jesus Christ your opinions on unions are narrow.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:10:25
Ignore anything Theymos or Luke-jr says.
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:28:06
Because this subreddit is poisonous? I wouldn't exactly want people new to Bitcoin getting their first impression from this place.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:04:43
Likewise. I thought this post would involve a joke of some sort.
@_date: 2016-11-12 03:42:42
Yeah, completely mind-blowing that politicians at the highest level aren't true to their word. Crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:16:13
Not for users? Man, your comment has that special kind of tone to it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:57:22
I was not aware I was arguing anything at all, other than this tone is unexpected from this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:00:21
Be careful with this interest of yours of pointing out hypocrisy in this sub, comrade. We will be sent to potato farm for discussing master's doublespeak.
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:38:27
The best use of the internet ever.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:55:57
Some might say that the best purpose of bitcoin is to be money rather than to make money.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:58:34
Yeah, this is a kind of weak brag.
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:20:45
Nah, actual adoption by masses
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:50:40
I don't know, our growing wealth disparity and ridiculous health care costs aren't exactly the crown jewels of capitalism.
@_date: 2016-10-25 16:46:33
How dare those millions people now have insurance. For shame, they should be spending more money for such a valuable business commodity as health!
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:24:42
You are asking the wrong crowd.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:17:41
I don't think you know what those words mean.
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:54:54
You know, I am sure the best way to get people on to Bitcoin is to call them idiots.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:07:02
People in the world receive help.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:25:26
What does this even mean
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:06:41
Decent argument, but I have to give you shit for starting off with "Sigh...."
@_date: 2016-10-25 17:11:06
They have competed, and now we have lower and lower ratios of every premium dollar that is actually spent on healthcare. I encourage you to read Deadly Spin,  by a former PR executive of CIGNA. And read his statements to the Senate.
