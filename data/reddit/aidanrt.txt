If I don't know what that means, neither does a new adopter of Bitcoin, who after a $15 purchase with a $15 fee, caused by some bizarre situation involving something called "Segwit", probably will then immediately give up on the "currency".

The funniest thing is that this sub is obsessed with rises and falls in price. It shows that for the most part no one here actually cares about the real mission of Bitcoin, as a decentralized currency that unites people in liberation from the finance system, and rather they just care about making money.

Dude, holding is ISOLATING the product from exchanges in the marketplace. Value is only derived from exchanges in a marketplace. End of story. Yes buying is healthy for bitcoin. Buying is NOT holding, and holding is absolutely terrible for bitcoin. Holding is treating bitcoin as an investment, and if everyone treats it as an investment IT WILL FAIL.
Edit this comment is probably at least slightly false and probably more

Well the article certainly does enough to make me evaluate my positions.
First of all by the definition of liquidity, holding decreases liquidity. The article is specifically saying that by getting greedy, holding Bitcoin and decreasing liquidity, eventually everyone will value Bitcoin highly and success will have occurred. At that point liquidity will be high.
I disagree with this in a couple ways. First of all, spending is not trying to get rid of something you claim to value. It is a *demonstration* of its value as well, as a merchant is then exposed to the ways in which Bitcoin is better than fiat (of course this assumes Bitcoin actually does have practical advantages over the dollar that a merchant would value). Secondly if everyone passively holds, how do new people become exposed to the possibility of using Bitcoin instead of the dollar?
It seems to me that for everyone to value Bitcoin more, more people need to know about it and need to know how to use it, need to know that it's useful, rather than the people who already know how to use it hoarding it. And spending and buying accomplishes this.
But maybe I'm wrong and everybody needs to just keep being greedy until eventually someone wants to spend their millions. But we've seen with the dollar, hoarders often don't want to spend. I don't feel that's a recipe for BTC to become the dominant currency.

Lol holding is not buying. Holding is stagnating, which can't happen because Bitcoin is not dominant yet. Buying is demand-increasing, and demand requires supply - selling. Holding is utterly useless in advancing Bitcoin.
Funny that you're the one accusing people of misunderstanding economics.
