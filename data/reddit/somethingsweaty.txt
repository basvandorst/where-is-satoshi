True, nobody knows for sure.  But, there are still crashes.  Hell, it just dropped by $100 today.

I am drug free.  I don't consume alcohol, tobacco, or even caffeine.  I just sold my house last week.  I do not aspire to be homeless but damn sure don't want to slave my life away either.  I'm working on finding that happy medium.  Starting over DEBT FREE.

Unless the government steps in, the value will continue to increase far beyond what it at now.  It is still possible to invest now and become very rich.   But, if the government steps in and regulates it and/or deems it illegal it will be completely worthless.
How much are you willing to lose completely?  That's how much you should invest.

Ugh, it's still relatively new.  Can't expect the world to change overnight.

I understand that but there are drug addicts, rich and poor..  If the man doesn't want to live by societies fucked up rules who are you to belittle him?  I say more power to him because fuck this debt slavery that is considered "normal" according to society.  I hope to be as free as this man one day..

Fuck you man.  Not everyone wants to be a slave of the system.  You just go be a good peasant and get in to debt buying a big house and fancy car and spend your whole life working to pay for it.  Keep pretending you are well off and ignore the fact that 1% of the population has 99% of the money.

Wait for a crash to buy.
