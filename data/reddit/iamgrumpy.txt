They sure are. Why do you think I'm so damned grumpy.
You can't even be critical of bitcoin or it will get deleted. At least on the DogeCoin reddit they have the decency to simply ignore those posts and let them rot

Many people do think it will replace fiat, but not me.
How is bitcoin "far superior" to gold? Gold is not easily traceable, can be found in the poorest parts of the world (as well as the richest and anywhere else), it can be used for more than just payments (semiconductors etc), established as a means of store of wealth and is fun to look at. 
I doubt bitcoin can be used for anywhere near the number of purposes gold can. an that is why GOLD/natural resources are better than bitcoin

It is the fault of the owners of the gambling site. The owners must have no morals by not even offering gambling addiction help. The owners are also responsible for this and are blatently stealing from this poor guy. He's obviously got an addiction. We don't want a drug dealer selling meth to a methhead. Some a gambling dealer let the gambler continue to get their addiction fix is no better.

I highly doubt everyone, or even most, of the people using bitcoin are over 18.
And free will is a fallacy almost as bad as the gamblers fallacy this poor soul fell in to.
If you had free will, would you really be engaging with me right now, or would you just have closed your browser window? The universe needs yin and yang, it needs addicts (like this poor guy) and dealers (like the just-dice admins). So what you may think is free will is really you doing what is required to make the universe even again.

Sure, but was that enough? In some jurisdictions it is not enough to warn someone. I do not want to see your brilliant money making scheme come down because of a moron.
Why didn't you ban them? There are certain codes of conduct even casinos run by. A rule of the trade is Don't let a known addict in your doors or you are asking to get your profits seized. Idiots like the one we are discussing are what gives you a bad name.

Yes, would you like to be sneezy

This isn't mainstream, nor is it a positive view on bitcoin.
Drugs are mainstream but you don't see people posting comics that are obviously stabs against drug subculture.
This wasn't printed in color, was in the daily news paper and had grammatical errors. This was obviously one of their crappier comics or they would have posted it on sunday.
That's okay though, keep thinking this is a positive comic. If you wish hard enough maybe you can even get a pony for your birthday.

Doing such would be good CYA policy

Finally an intelligent answer that actually gives me some reasons.
Thank you, and I actually mean thank you. 
Some people do not get what the point of my posts are, but you do.
r/bitcoin needs to learn to think more, assess critically, and reply with actual reasons versus "fiat is evil".
Clear, thought out and informative post.
Thank you

So they are unable to design chips and now want free help so they can make a load of money. Where do I sign up?!? Can I sign away all of my IP, or do I need to go ask Mt. Gox?

I do not know which is a worse investment. Buying a mine, or selling it for bitcoin.
