Yes, but if their value is more stable, you aren't going to sell in a dip. That's the point.

I heavily recommend against buying bitcoin to guard against a financial crisis unless you can afford to leave it there. Many people would need to sell their bitcoin to pay for rent, food or what have you, and that means they could well sell in the middle of a price crash.
Go with something safer and less volatile like physical gold shares, unless you can afford to leave the money alone.

You do have the trade war with China to worry about. The dollar has been performing very strongly recently, which, if you're paying in dollars, has made buying gold favourable if you want to avoid risk in the future. And in pounds, the price of gold [has trended downwards]( so if you are likely to withdraw money from your choice of instrument within five years, or you are bearish on the long term prospects of US stocks, I would still go with gold.

They can sell at any time, but if they sell in a dip, they get far less money for their bitcoin. They've effectively thrown money away.

People will pay their rent and food in whatever is common and valuable at the time, or in equivalent value. A barter economy is likely to rise in things like fuel, food, shelter and tools in this 'financial collapse' scenario. Firstly, bitcoin needs electricity (A lot of it) to function, and secondly, people need to see it as valuable. 
Even gold in such a scenario wouldn't be perfect because you'd need to find somebody who will accept your gold in exchange for tangible things that are valuable and needed right now which would only happen if the person was very confident in their food, water and shelter, and you also need to have your gold split into easily sellable pieces. An ingot isn't very useful, as you'll be overpaying for whatever you're buying.

China could engage in a currency war with the US to make its exports extremely competitive. China could also flood the market with all of the US national debt bonds that they hold. They're certainly not 'all out of ammo', they just can't do a 'tit for tat' tariff proposal. If they wanted to economically hurt the US, they're very much able to.

I'm actually rather against bitcoin mate. Watch your assumptions. I believe the wild energy usage of the proof of work algorithm is unsustainable, and the system currently in place supports centralisation due to the ballooning ledger size and ASIC prevalence.
I like the fact that you didn't even attempt to respond properly to my comment or include any evidence.

That's quite correct, and another reason I don't particularly trust the high growth rate we are currently seeing to be sustainable in the medium to long term. Higher spending with lower taxes simply isn't able to keep up. The debt to GDP ratio is the one that matters, and the US is currently at about 105%, compared to Japan which is at 250+%, so it does have a while to fall, but that is another reason to be skeptic of the future of US stocks and the dollar.

So it didn't drop 50% in five years, my claim still stands.
As for the USD being a stable store of value... [the 1980s and 2009 disagree]( Those big spikes are where the dollar lost value relative to gold.
And the USD is a fiat currency, as in the only reason it holds value is because the US government says it does, whereas gold is backed physically by a real metal. You can't have hyperinflation because there is only a finite supply of the metal, therefore it is more stable.
I'd have thought being in a bitcoin subreddit you'd have known that.

[The value of gold has not dropped 50% over five years]( It has gone down since the five years, when you'd expect it to go up due to inflation. That's because investors are perceiving less risk. The 2009 financial crash caused a huge spike in gold prices and the [dollar has performed unusually strongly recently]( And the reason that gold prices tend to fluctuate is because,

Yes, but if the buying power of their bitcoin falls (Which it does when the price falls), it's functionally the same. If it is a currency, its value can rise and fall with respect to other currencies. And if it has another crash right when the pound does, people are going to have a very hard time putting food on the table.
And bitcoin cannot buy most things today like food, water, housing and so on. You have to change it back into the host country's currency to spend that. It's best to use a commodity that has a fairly stable 'value' for that, as the buying power of gold doesn't change year on year.
