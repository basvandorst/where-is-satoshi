How in the fuck is that ironic. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:59:29
Somewhat sure!
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:19:01
Ahh good point! Still the same idea though its never going faster then c

Any apparent slowing of light is due to absorption and re-emitting in the material medium. It's still moving at the speed of light as it transfers from atom to atom.

Man I remember when Coinbase had a 0.1BTC referral. Posted mine on reddit and got 0.4BTC
@_date: 2012-08-16 09:13:27
Hah modest sum my ass ;)

So the money that you would be hypothetically getting is from people who have bots set up to trade in hopes they make money with it but in this case they would actually loose? Correct?
@_date: 2012-08-14 20:36:03
I tried to transfer as well and It said there was a problem and to try again. The transfer just went back into my account. It seems like they are having some problems and I would hope they would reimburse you.

I got my 0.5 out to mtgox so it does happen. 
@_date: 2012-01-03 01:12:57
Oh your right my bad.
@_date: 2012-10-14 17:31:42
wow I never thought about mining being so worth it in places that are lower income. 
@_date: 2012-01-02 22:08:53
I wonder how many Mhash/s that card will pull!
@_date: 2012-08-13 08:11:29
True but after all I may not have posted it if it weren't for the referral. I don't see why it would upset people. The option to non-referral is still there. 
@_date: 2012-08-16 09:19:42
I don't see how you would actually make money. How would that trade go through? I don't think I'm understanding the picture properly 
@_date: 2012-08-12 22:19:16
You have to varify your account and then you get it. You need your email and phone its just a text you get with at number.
@_date: 2012-01-03 06:17:26
Interesting way of calculating it. But who knows maybe the new architecture is better or worse for mining.
@_date: 2012-08-13 07:46:16
Yea I thought about that but whats the harm of a few downvotes. I just wanted to see if I would get any referrals. 
@_date: 2012-08-13 07:58:03
You can opp'ed to just have a text sent instead. I didn't like the app idea either, I don't know why the text isn't default. 
@_date: 2012-01-03 01:13:51
That's what I thought so I find it surprising they would mention it in there key notes.
@_date: 2012-08-16 09:08:42
And how exactly does this bug work
@_date: 2012-01-03 01:46:48
Slow reader =P
@_date: 2012-08-13 06:42:22
They may not let such a new account withdraw yet. Maybe try again tomorrow?

I'm sorry but I'm really not seeing "definite correlation between the dead spots on the map and countries identified as "repressed". You have a small blog. It's only known in the USA, that's most blogs. Then there's a bunch of other countries that have a tiny bit of traffic. That doesn't mean anything. You don't have nearly the volume of visitors to make the claim you are. Oh look Libya is repressed yet has the same traffic as France. Same as Ukraine and Belarus. Even if you did have the traffic to make an accurate assessment there are just as many cases that disprove your claim as prove it.

The website seems like a good way to get value out of your bitcoins. The Prices seem reasonable. But a much better buy when bitcoin prices are high.
@_date: 2011-10-22 17:38:35
You sound crazy
@_date: 2011-10-22 23:34:42
Uhh with 8 characters theres 99999999 different combos and thats with only numbers. If they use letter too, and I think they are, it goes up exponentially. So no a ton of coins will not have the same 8-character code
Edit: 208827064586 with letters
@_date: 2011-09-12 06:33:24
Bitch you seriously need to explain why -.-
@_date: 2011-10-24 02:21:46
Why would you try and find one that "matches"? That code is just to check the balance. So if you did what your saying all you would accomplish is seeing the balance of a bunch of unknown people's coins. Pointless.

Yet another case of people thinking about Fibonacci way to deeply

how many BTC do you have?
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:25:33
And how much does each box cost? And the wattage?
