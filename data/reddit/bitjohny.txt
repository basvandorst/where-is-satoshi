I am really going to need an explanation on the 36% and how this happened. I go to the site and see the following:
"Multi-sig Hot wallet
Provided by BitGo (BitGo FAQ)
Only holds minimal amounts (~0.5% of customer funds)"
and you probably want to take off the part that reads: 
We pride ourselves on being the most secure bitcoin exchange."
and explain how this happened if: 
"Further, since we now enforce multi-institutional second factor authentication (Bitfinex will be the first factor and BitGo the second factor), attackers are required to compromise both institutions before getting funds."... because this smells that BitGo got compromised and we should be able to claim insurance off of them. 
I have been mostly on the sidelines because of the communication but as of late we haven't been receiving much and I feel there is a vacuum of information regarding how this happened. I see a lot of people are also having trouble figuring out how you came up with the 36%... I was expecting a little less than that without socializing the loss with other coins so we need some clarity here please.

Hard to know for sure but these oddities are concerning... Also, the increase in trading volumes during spikes seem to not affect those 'top' exchanges either to the upside or downside.

Yeah, I struggle with all these accusations mostly focused on bitfinex and market manipulation... when things look super sketchy on other "higher" volume exchanges. I think the community needs to be more critical and analytical as well of the rest.
