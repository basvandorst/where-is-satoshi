SegWit transactions are still measured via their size in bytes. The discount with SegWit transactions happen because they take up less bytes, not because they are simply SegWit.

Not that I’m aware of.   I am curious if this is something that’s also available.  You can always check meetup.com to see if if there are local crypto hangouts.

I know right?! See you in the ₿itcoin Citadel! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:56:28
You're a little off on your math. 
1 Satoshi is 0.00000001 
With ₿itcoin at $9200 $1 USD == 0.00010870 BTC or 10870 Satoshi.  ₿itcoin needs to be at $100,000,000 before 1 Satoshi == $1 USD
Edit: Awe crap, I can't read. 
That means ₿itcoin will need to be at $1,000,000 for 1 Satoshi to be equal to a penny. Man, wouldn't that be something....

It's not a serious flaw. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and is deflationary by nature. It's a **feature** not a flaw.

Thanks for linking your transaction. It looks like you only paid a 5 Satoshi per Byte fee. Transactions which you want to confirm quickly currently need ~150 Sat/Byte fee.

Could you link to the transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:58:56
I was going to buy yesterday but it was on a Bullrun to $5k which it almost hit. I think I saw it go as high as $4980. I felt like waiting a little bit to see if it would come down after the run and just bought some more at $4,520 after watching the depth charts on GDAX.   I think now is a good time to buy as it seems there is support at $4500.

I am still unsure of the benefits of investing in GBTC vs just buying bitcoin.   GBTC trades at like a 2x premium over bitcoin IIRC.
