Who wants to use a currency named Herv, anyway? I'm also hoping your real name isn't Herv :(

Would you recommend your top-three suggestions for a Bitcoin virgin? I feel overwhelmed and do not know where to begin.

ಠ_ರೃ what a plum full post of kindness. One upvote for you, good citizen @_date: 2014-11-09 16:42:38
Please enjoy 1 upvote as dessert, good sir and/or madam.

Please do this, good sirs and/or ma'ams! I would gladly join and abandon the others.
