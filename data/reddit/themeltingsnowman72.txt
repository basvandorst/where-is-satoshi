I was there when the post went up, at around 11 mins old. The original twisted post was there, and I kept having a look. Somewhere between 35 mins and 50 mins the twisted post was edited, I then copy/posted it into the thread. At the time it looked like a third party had jumped in, neither twisted, nor giveaway guy as the style looked completely different.
My timings however are spot on, I always look at how old posts are for some reason and I remember seeing 11, 35 and 51.

I know they were worth $1.6, but it hasn't said how much he actually paid in total for that.

Well there you go. And I just spoke to the girl in question, she confirmed her Reddit account had been hacked.

God. Do you need everything explained in B I G. L E T T E R S?
She put up her address a few days ago. This morning, it was announced she was the winner by hacker number 1. Number 1 posted the link to her comment which won. LATER, hacker number 2, went into her account, changed the address (probably hoping maybe money hadn't been sent, but hacker number 1 had ALREADY chosen her address) and left a troll comment as an edit saying the money was now laundered. Why? Fuck knows what goes on in the heads of some Redditors, shits and giggles probably.
So no, Number 1 had got the address BEFORE number 2 hacked in.  Do you understand now?

Jeez dude, you really need too get out more.

Can someone explain to a noob (me) why this is exciting news? 
@_date: 2016-08-24 11:19:28
Username certainly fucking checks out.

Biological parents are normally from different families.
Dog breeding is pure and complete in-breeding. It is probably the worst kind of animal cruelty that is completely socially acceptable. Pure breds have far shorter lives, and suffer from many congenital diseases that cause the animals to suffer greatly as they get past 5-6 years old.
