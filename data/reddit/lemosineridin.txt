@_date: 2019-07-17 11:59:32
I agree. They may be forced to play hopscotch with the orange faced regime, but the go ahead nonetheless.  What, (if any) price swing do you see as a result?
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:47:38
Just for fun I’ve been setting limit buys at 300-400 below the current price. It’s been a good day

I’m not here to argue, chief. This is not an ALT SUB though, and I’m simply poking fun at the amount of times BTC (and rock dwelling alts) have died since their debuts.

@_date: 2019-07-09 18:08:22
Not arguing for argument sake, but I do think the “average person” has a number in mind. For those who’ve been in this space for a while I would think you’re correct in thinking that it’s arbitrary.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:05:09

Saying that would cause a big dip insinuates that most ppl who have crypto are criminals. (I.e. not paying gains). They know I have it. I claimed losses last year (because my dumbass lost money figuring out the market)  they can send all the carrier pigeons in the world.  All this shows is that the US is desperate to scrape money off the coattails of cryptocurrency as it falls into an impending recession. AGAIN.

But the 4 hour chart!!! ��
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:12:08
I just dunno what this market needs. It seems like the more it gets what it wants from innovation, recognition, tanking national currencies etc.. it goes down. Maybe the most recent futures closing will rekindle a rally? I’m at a loss

@_date: 2019-07-15 00:49:19
That’s not how it works
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:13:53
But if it’s opposite... I think we get back into the 12’s very quickly
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:10:05
Yes. However, it takes a solid 3-5 business days.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:24:04

Somewhat concerned with the weekly/monthly chart.  Each pump or gains lead us to a lower high away from 13.8. Then test lower lows... what is different about this one? I really hope this 9k thing was a simple pit stop

Thank you. I appreciate your time and willingness to help me wrap my mind around something.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:57:36
is it at 5.5? You’re the only thing bring out the negativity in me today.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:28:12
It’s unpredictable in nature but a fairly simple game.  Buy high and sell low. Read charts until  you can’t breathe and always panic sell the dips.

@_date: 2019-07-11 21:13:35
It’s too obvious
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:40:08
These articles that surface out of the blue taking about things in absolutes make my head explode. Last week it’s going to 100k. This week the rally is over for remainder of the year.  Its terrible reporting.

@_date: 2019-07-31 01:08:33
I mean Coinbase send alerts of 5-10% swings. I just silence them. Sucks to wake up to. Sometimes lol
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:30:12
The worst part about panic selling is...
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:13:46
Also, (you’ll pay a larger fee) BUT you can buy on coinbase regular and send it to pro immediately with 0 fee
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:26:19
I’ve learned so much from BTC, and then I buy at a high number and watch it drop for a while. So I HODL. All this time I wonder... when it drops like this, why do the “bulls” not respond with a punch of their own.  Is it in their best interest to just sell along with others so they can ride the action back up? Sounds like a great plan if you have the liquidity to do so... (I know, I know... DCA). But really, where is the bull response?
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:40:06
Why the downvote? Is it a shitty question
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:29:20
Anyone think the pullback has influence on reaching ATH
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:44:04
You speculate, and speculate, not taking any stance. You throw out percentages and stats that NOBODY can validate or even find (for example: your stat about percentages of Americans that own and hold)  you’re simply a boob. I will waste no further time helping you get your rocks of in your mother’s basement. If you have a job you need to be fired for time theft. Just disappear

One large green candle in the form of a bull response can change the entire landscape.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:08:36
Excited about this cup and handle. Explain
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:40:44
You’re absolutely correct. I dunno how many times I’ve been burnt trying to trade through a pullback to recoup losses.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:35:39
I could feel it coming. So I just HODL’d

I think it’s important that you’re watching the news. But break down what you’re saying. Congress is expressing concerns about crypto. (Hell Yeahhh they are) 
Regulating it can mean safety and trust for large investments to come.

Well all of this sounds delightful.

The charts show the whales are being very patient today.  Waiting for the purchases to complete. Dump, causing panic. Then they will buy them cheaper. But that’s okay. Because I just HODL.  Ugh. Pump it!!!

So much worse.

We haven’t had a good pump in a while.  It appears to be small gains followed by equally larger but inorganic dumping.  Why can’t we play the whale pump game again ?  Genuine question

I won’t answer that. But the sentiment is shit right now. So most of your troll/ shorters will say no for obvious reasons (as you’ll see). 
On the other hand you have:
Adoption, big players entering, ETF possibilities, Bakkt, proper custodial services, good regulation... etc.

The problem is just that....   it might not do the latter 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:03:31
I’ll match your bet and double down 
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:58:19

How was Feb. 5th for you 
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:59:04
Microsoft and Starbucks accepting BTC in November of THIS YEAR.   That’s incredible.  I’m sure old news to some but huge strides. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:03:13
Agreed. (Move comma one right) 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:02:41
Friday pump tomorrow.  And some Holiday pay for my middle class plus investors ����
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:35:21
Roger that... continuous prodding...
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:37:51
Thank you for acknowledging. Now I’m going to downvote you 
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:00:46
We can drop 450 in 1.5 hours... but hover within 100 for 2 days.  I don’t understand how I’m still surprised by that 
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:49:33
F MAY GO AWAY
@_date: 2018-08-30 21:55:19
Breaking through 7k again would be killer 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:27:19
Holy triceratops shit dude.  Did you not read where I fucking said I have no idea what it will do.  That’s why I just watch it.  Typically it will do exactly the opposite. But being the troll you’ve grown into (or maybe you just came like that) you read what you want to hear and spit out garbage in a sarcastic ass way ... 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:34:41
Got Em 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:23:10
Again Jerry?! Clean yourself up

Yessss they can 
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:50:02
Awhhh. Downvote Debby is here.  It worked yesterday when I Booed. Trying it again. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:05:41
Good morning Asia.  Bitcoin anyone? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:52:14

Hello everyone and welcome to Pump and Dump Festival 2018.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:04:55
Gosh thanks.  My directional math was failing me!
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:54:00
You’re Kidding?! 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:14:25
I hope you’re right 
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:22:30
It’s a dare downvotets. Sheesh 
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:08:19
Haha I know but it’s how I say it.  They 10’s. I bought em from somebody but they nice though lmao 
I copped my first titty fondling during that scene when I was 12!  Ahhh. The good days 
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:12:40
Nobel prize winning “NonGNonM” makes obvious troll statements rated at a 4 for originality.

Trying to find a light in a dark cave. I feel you   
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:07:51
Welllll shit 
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:12:37
I apologized once. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:28:29
I would positively rather hang out in the 8’s 
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:50:39
No problem here. Nothing to see 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:51:18
Remember when ETFs didn’t mean shit

Holy Santa clause shit.  This made my day. Month even. ��
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:19:09
At noon I want to look and see 8600.  Again this is a want. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:02:16
Listen.. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:40:45
Well if I start looking like the ppl who I wait in line for at the gas stations just kill me now... “I’ll have a 12, uhhh a 21... ��
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:31:12
I’m out on my initial investment for the year in October.  If we do t get to 8200 it will be at a loss.  But, I’ll be extremely happy as to not check the price when I wake up, at lunch, 2pm, after work... and then again at bedtime. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:19:40
Both of you are right.  I’m the epitome of this scenario. I’m a poor week away from being done.  
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:53:39
I’ve witnessed big time uptrends with low volume 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:13:27
Well... yes.  History has proved that dumb-dumb 
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:06:52
You were late to the feelings party.  I just had an epiphany that this is mf’in butter and that it provides entertainment even if I’m losing money on it. (I can afford what I would lose). Plus I’ve won .4 BTC over the past 3 weeks to hedge loses. 12-3-2.  Kma 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:58:26
It is a proven entity according to a guest on The JRE that there are paid Fudsters AS WELL AS FOMO providers. He’s a doctor lol. That’s my source 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:33:09
By the way.... the general public doesn’t concern me nearly as much as corporations and big business adoption.  Joe smith who invests .2 BTC is very popular. But eBay, Starbucks, and McDonald’s adoption is far more substantial. And as technology grows to meet the needs of those entities...  you take your guess at the value 
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:22:48
Must have forgotten to post that TA during one of your “trips” dipfuck.  You have history FudStar 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:51:10
Thanks for your honesty though
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:10:15
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:29:32
And to you the same. Easy enough right 
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:47:57
Well.  I bought in the 8ks to begin with.  It could go to 10 in 2.5 days.  I’ve seen it do this kinda thing both ways.  The future is bright.  She’s always a lady 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:18:26
But the price is congruent with other current prices lol. Sooo. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:27:00
Ppl have been asking this question for 5 years lol 
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:09:35
See. I told you I should bring out the Booo 
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:09:58
Well wait a minute here. Just because it’s one giant pumpstick doesn’t mean it’s not growth by an entity claiming a position.  I’ll take it 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:52:59
Entities really want this thing suppresssed 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:06:26
Can’t take a man serious who lives a second life, is obsessed with masturbation, Muslims, and mushrooms. ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:34:48
Thanks man. Mood ����
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:15:46
Apparently it has nothing to do with the increases in technology, more awareness, less fear of regulation, lower fees, faster transaction times, or just an overwhelming sense of improvement.  Apparently none of that ...
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:59:23
You heard that?! 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:51:30
I love the stability.  Very attractive to large investers easy to produce the jump in the morning. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:38:31
Please 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:37:55
Would you agree these dips are are very “well orchestrated” in order to provide cheaper investment opportunities for “Future investors”
I’d really like opinions on this. It seems overly conspicuous to me 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:44:18
Look at those strong finger muscles. Cowards and pussies troll. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:28:19
I would love to meet you and have a whiskey.  You’re literally the biggest asshole here but I can’t help but laugh lol 
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:42:52
I feel like calling out big money here.  Show your face other than skateboard barting up and down these streets.  The ceiling is the Roof!!!
@_date: 2018-08-01 11:57:39
Okay then, good dip people. Upwards and onwards 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:54:47
Please don’t. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:41:13
How is it ever confirmed 
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:04:04
 Cool doom and gloom buddy 
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:26:28
I’ll wait 
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:44:03
As soon as it shows 8 I’m buying again. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:23:22
Thaaaats depressing 
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:50:21
All it takes is one 1k push to gain excitement again. This boring weak nature is not new for ppl who have been doing this for 3 years
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:55:49
Was thinking the same.  When I buy it’s “available instantly” and then usually debited within 24 hours 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:07:43
Hahahaha. How much time ya got champ 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:57:41
With the attention span of humans in this time of the world... I think the future “price” of BTC will be decided in the next 6 months.  
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:04:43
Omg. Right?!   So bad 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:45:49
Hahaha. I get downvotes for saying it looks like a glitch occurred?  
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:18:18
You’re just not witty or funny.  I know it’s sarcasm, but it’s not even good sarcasm. It’s as if your meter is permanently set on subpar mediocrity 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:26:11
I can see it too.  It looks to be a glitch.  I’m seeing like 144,,,,,,,,,
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:07:33
The price is moving nonetheless. So there is that. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:48:40
Bitcoin looks like my monthly statement right now. The pumps being my income and the dumps signify bills and when things break unexpectedly. I just keep hoping nothing breaks ....
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:48:50
Orrrr. We’re just somewhere in the middle 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:10:43
Look! It’s the Tweedles 
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:05:19
Your logic is undeniable.  
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:08:26
I used to get so nervous about this stuff. Now it’s just entertainment.  It goes up, really high. Then it comes down. Then it goes up higher. Lol it’s not hard.  It’s just the frontier of the whole fucking money world.  Might as well hang out 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:07:53
Upward popsicles 
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:54:25
I had the same thought 
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:36:13
I’m good with today being over 
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:14:22
Great guess man. Really imaginative 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:12:58
I can feel it. Can you 
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:48:38
Lol I’m on my phone and I own a landscaping company lol. Picture that

“These guys want to get rich again”.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:13:40
I dunno man. Lol 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:40:01
We’re all getting older. What will you tell the ppl you interact with the most about these times of Coin?
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:57:54
What I mean by that is it’s a 3 day event during “Blockchain week”. Plenty of pump time a-comin 
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:00:04
I hate to be the “relax” guy. But... 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:44:59
It’s like your mother in more ways than youve described 
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:49:16
Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market undoubtedly had one of the best weeks in history in terms of merchant adoption and institutionalization of digital assets, given the announcement of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Microsoft, and Starbucks to create a cryptocurrency exchange and to accept digital assets as a payment method.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:11:03
Enough about the ETF. Don’t need it. Never have. This is the ppls money!!!!!! 
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:54:54
The ride will be trying but fun 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:58:40

Yuuup.  Every time I go to sleep I prepare to be poorer when I wake up.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:25:28
You okay?
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:18:25
I sure hope so 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:55:23
Although not surprised by dips at this point... I’m a little taken aback by it. The timing is odd. I’ve literally read no valid reasons for drops of the 500 in a day nature 
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:08:47
Stay long 
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:58:50
It’s 4% lol 
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:10:04
Honestly man I’m pretty positive that we’re going to test lows within 24 hours followed by an astounding pumpalumpagous 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:50:50
You’re wrong 
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:13:17
Really 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:28:14
The same person theee days earlier pointing his tail to sky while moaning “mooooon”
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:46:13
Once again this provides Reddit a reason for a character limit.  Your points, although well thought out are skewed. Metals can be used as a standard for value... however they’re not. That’s just one.  
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:12:56
Nawh.  It actually being manipulated 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:04:53
Why are there so many broke people investing in the most volatile thing known to this world  
“Drop so I can afford it”   What happens when you finally “afford it” and it drops more? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:23:27
I know what I’ll be hodling at the end of the day 
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:28:12
It will pass 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:35:37
What did you win 
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:46:34
Dammit.  Cmon. 8500. LEGO 
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:23:49
I’ve never understood the take a step back to take two forward with this platform. Is it an OCD thing where you have to shut the door twice before you walk through it? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:00:58
Sorry dude. I was just trolling the troller. Serious Meter was about a 2 there 
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:51:02
Go home.  You don’t get it 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:27:50
You’re not speculating a notion of speculation here are you?
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:29:45
I’ve said it before.  These whales need to be aware that there will nothing left of they’re not careful 
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:33:22
I took care of it 
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:41:24
Oh shiiiiiit lol 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:26:25
I’d be crazy if I didn’t ask what too 5 were
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:03:32
If you just asked, you’ve created the only reporting anyone would need
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:33:51
Went from booing to clapping today. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:45:57
That’s 4/10. 40/100. 400/1000... so on 
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:18:37
I don’t mind some foreplay 
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:16:23

Second pump in 3.2.1...
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:26:52
I’m holding the shit out of some coin right now 
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:21:57
You’re tired 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:51:33
I gotta start booing more often 
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:41:39
I want to get excited. So bad 
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:31:01
I’m ready!
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:58:37
Seriously like torture.  I’m turning it off. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:33:51
Lol yup 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:06:40
Hello. I’m here 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:53:01
And I diiiid 
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:34:43
Holy shit. Lmao. He’s wild 
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:17:35
Starting to agree man. It’s annoying at least 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:42:25
Agree 
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:47:29
Good news they said.  
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:43:18
Could be.  If my comments are not 100% positive towards the current price ppl get mad.  But I’m not a troll. I like to think I’m an innocent bystander �� 
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:12:21
Still 5 months left of this particular season 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:01:42
I saw that as well 
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:23:18
Today has been a weird song and dance.  We shall see what tomorrow has in store 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:56:41
If you don’t own crypto and you “participate” in this room at all... your life is sad. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:23:01
I’m also confused by the notion. As crypto enthusiasts would be thrilled to know that “whales” aren’t simply dumping for profit.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:12:23
This is at least good for word of mouth.  CHEAP Coin 
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:23:24
Strong hands.  I do expect dumps. No, I will not guess to what level but those buy orders are going up.  Everyone knows we’re stalled out right now.  Meanwhile the technology and necessary regulatory issues are being ironed out.  
I’ll wait 
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:47:31
I honestly want to ask the same question 
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:30:03
Stands on table in middle of room and lets  out exaggerated BOOOOOOOOOOO’s 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:16:58
YES!  Finally...  an IDFK 
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:25:59
What if you’re capable of both? *mind blown*
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:36:11
Two whale pumps and it’s “ohh my gaawwddd!!!!  We gotta jump in”.  Cmon. Everyone knows that 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:27:31
No doubt man.  He’s a giant debauchery 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:19:49
My logic is “it just won’t” lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:49:25
Everything that’s happening is a good scenario for BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:17:00
Typically right around the time my confidence goes to an all time low the market gives reason for hope.  News is mostly optimistic but I really think it’s just simple manipulation and accumulation going on.  Moon and June rhyme?
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:33:16
Haha. He doesn’t know lol 
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:58:58
I want to buy right now so badly. I just had to invest an unexpected amount of money into my business and I’m out of funds for a couple weeks. Agghhhhh
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:00:52
3 minutes 
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:01:47
See it can’t come to that 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:33:25
Volatility on HIGH right now 
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:07:53
Short it.  
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:27:17
Oh!  I read them. I read all of it lol 
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:46:38
That’s what I keep repeating lol 
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:04:00
Just a little run away from  5 digits 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:04:06
No man, mooo on. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:52:49
I mean we thought I would give you an upvote sir 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:32:21
I want to just stand up an Booo loudly 
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:23:26
The Starbucks pump coming 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:06:10
Hey now! Cheap coins 
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:43:11
BTC needs an initiative.  A purpose type cause.  Going green lol. Like that

I liked you better 8 days ago 
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:49:32
There’s a lot of money being moved around by people “dipping their toes”.  
I’m a huge Hodler myself. I will be fine if I “lose” my two chunks (both big buys were in the 8ks) but it seems that the powers that be have us on a string.  IMO it’s simple collaboration between two sides.  You guys sell all yours....  we will buy it back and trade you the profits.  Seems like a big bag of shit right now honestly, and I’m pretty positive about it 90% of the time.
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:55:08
I’m comfortable. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:44:32
I always await SOME kind of positive news (have we not gotten that?! Am I missing something) 
I’m getting extremely impatient 
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:48:03
Why are you actually here 
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:00:52
Good luck with your pumps, good luck with your dumps. When Moon? When Lambo? I like my sums in lumps!  Ohhhhh. Have a fun weekend everyone. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:33:42

Lively bunch in here 
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:50:32
We may have bounced back but it certainly doesn’t feel like a reversal. The charts are aligning once again to the downside
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:38:36
I get cold feet when we sit here like this. The last time I remember we this pattern. 6k went to 4 real quick.   
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:29:43
Well, we’re lower than we were two years ago. Sorta troubling to me

Hey bud. I’m in this for the LONG. But we can spit out YTD all we want. Still down from 2 years ago
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:23:31
Agreed.  You don’t need a TA if you have eyeballs IMO.  The charts are almost symmetrical steps into the cellar
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:52:35
I’ve been waiting 1.4 years lol 
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:39:07
I mean.. I like Memes.  It spreads adoption in millennial crowds. However, if you can come up with the 55+ crowd memes lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:14:37
It is funny though how 15k was tight around the corner in all the news articles only a few months back. Now, the exact same publications are projecting 2.5k
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:54:37
There are still ppl with major confidence out there. But the charts typically don’t lie... and they’re screaming down down down
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:58:18
I appreciate your speech on my behalf.
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:36:57
Bro you’re not kidding.  I’m patiently losing money over here lol.  “Oh god you invested money you can’t afford to lose”. No. I just invested money dangerously with a a higher interest rate than I would like lol. Cmon 5k!

Lmao 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:37:46
It seems to me ( this is an observation ) So do t get them in a wad but I honestly feel that if there was institutional money “lining up at the gates” we would see more evidence of that.  Or are they all breaking the law by sending messages to one another about the dates and times to buy? That could be happening... I just think it’s highly unlikely and interest (although I’m on the sidelines watching this bleed)  is dwindling by the  week. I wish moons and Lambo for all but I just think the ship may have been boarded already. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:50:09
It’s too volatile they said. Too much fluctuation...  well... here it is
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:01:57

That’s usually when a breakout one way or the other occurs so he’s not far off. Look at the 3M Chart.

I think I might be ready to buy another coin ��
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:29:02
I’m not a believer it’s bottomed. I really think tests of 6k are coming before we head to 10
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:54:00
8800 would suffice
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:05:00

Wellllll.  It’s almost April.  When 5k?
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:30:40
When I’m BTC history has price stayed statistically or percentage in this tight of a range?  Real question 
@_date: 2018-10-04 22:45:27
Do you 
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:22:17
This thing needs a 5300 drop.  Then 10k is huge. ATH IS 4x the money.  
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:46:55
Someone really hates the idea of 7500
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:06:55

all 4 areas need work. I believe, unfortunately, that with in order to truly be decentralized, adoption will be slow.  Boomers and uninformed individuals don’t trust it due to that fact. (These are just my opinions and do not portray whole truths)
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:53:03
This is similar to starting a 2 cycle chainsaw in the spring time AMIRITE

ArticleS related to BTC are extremely annoying.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:10:36
Completely normal 15% daily drops and -30% on the week.  No problem. Nothing to see here
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:09:23
Why the hell does Coinbase (I’ve just been too lazy to set up a new wallet) put a 5 day fraud hold on purchases already cleared by my bank.

@_date: 2019-11-21 13:02:15
Orrrr.  I need someone to hold my hand.  Since the recent 10k drop I’ve been considering selling and buying back lower. (A move I hate doing that would surely backfire)
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:45:20
Thank you. Tell jim_Bob to get over his mini breakdown and learn to answer straightforward questions. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 22:17:28
I love having sold at 7k and watching this (I sold at a loss after holding ALLLL year so don’t bitch) I needed the money.  I’ll come back but I’m very interested to see what low 6’s does to ppls psyche. (Now you can contribute to the conversations without trolling or acting like you know more than tone else). Love you guys 
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:02:29
Okay WHEW.  I didn’t miss the moon ��

But I’m more at peace right now for some reason than I’ve ever been.  It’s all because of a comment I heard 3 months ago...  “we should hold onto it... you know they want to get rich again”. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:58:43
This occurs every time. Don’t worry

Honestly man...  I laughed and I like this guy 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:02:51
I can’t wait 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:58:57
I hate this but it’s trendy 
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:37:31
This has become so predictable and frustrating.   Yet, I don’t sell before the Simpson movie starts again. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:19:14
Annnnd falling.   It’s sad when you can watch the dump.  
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:56:29
Anybody home 
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:53:38
This looks like yesterday.  Again. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:04:13
Sorry 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:27:17
This has to be the time big money will dive in.  
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:19:54
But, this one hasn’t unfolded yet 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:10:10
I literally look every 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:27:02
They just don’t want it to happen.  Manipulate. 
Ppl still buy. I know tons of ppl buying.  But it’s really strange to me that the charts are clockwork.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:39:42
Realized thPugh 
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:05:09
Give it a whirl
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:53:07
Wait. Wait one damn second here. I haven’t seen a daily Hopium in a while have I?!
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:07:02
Take a step back so I can get some extension on this ...
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:58:33
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:55:03
Remember the gold standard?  Cmon man.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:09:46
Absolutely 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:35:23
This was posted yesterday sooooo
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:47:04
Get back above 7 k FFS 
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:39:23
Do you come up to traffic lights hoping it turns red? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:36:54
Someone.  Finally. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:22:00
The powers that be will not let this rise right now. Every time it does...  dump city.   I dunno how I feel about my positions in the 8’s.   I’m strong all up in the 8’s.   It’s so close, but yet it seems so far away just to get back 
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:09:09
All it takes is one move in the direction of confidence and we’re playing ball again 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:08:08
Along what your self esteem. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:23:47

@_date: 2018-06-28 23:12:34
There he is 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:58:00
Congrats man.  Life accomplishment 
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:57:38
On a Saturday?! Of all days
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:01:50
Another insight that discredits history (of the actual entity being discussed) 
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:55:17
It just feels like I’m going to read some stupid article tomorrow about how 12k BTC was “rejected” and so dropped tom10.5.  
The whales are trading right now, but not longing.  They will.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:09:40
Best comment I’ve seen yet. All timer
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:39:03
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:44:43
Just a question. I just have a feeling we retrace 10.8. Stay there for a while. I’m wrong usually. But. It truly is a sentiment type game
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:09:50
Where I’m from it’s basically just a red neck guy with little to no worth 
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:07:57
If we close about 10.3 I’ll be happy about the dip response and slowly rise through August. Explode around October 15th
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:31:20
It’s the “do you have the nuts to ride this ride, squeeze”
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:22:15
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:39:25
And trigger volume 
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:08:54
Looks like a green middle finger. 
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:18:42
That’s impressive
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:33:37
You can blame it on whatever you want.  We need purpose.  That’s all we really need. 
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:12:37
These sell walls are intimidating
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:04:47
This guy.  Love it 
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:47:32
Prophet of sorts ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:16:09
Sometimes I hope you collapse 
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:19:22
Guess 
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:13:52
The pump were about to experience will be that of institutional proportions 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:24:53
Trump? Is that you? 
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:06:25
I was looking at the price.  You know how it starts dropping and you can see it drop fast...  well it was doing that 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:48:11
I may be one of the only ppl in here who understands that ref 
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:14:11
Tough to keep a good man down. (I think BTC could be a woman..?)
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:34:49
One more run at 12.1k. If it Doesn’t land... may retrace 10.9???  I dunno. Just guessing on trends
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:24:45
Literally WTF. Sorry. I’m good
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:39:21
If you’re using savings to pay for rent... is it actually savings

6600 on Monday would be forward thinking �� 
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:56:27
The sun will rise tomorrow. And so will Bitcoin. Well, at least I’m right so far.
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:34:45
Hey bud!  Glad you’re here today ��

You should sell your house too and buy it back cheaper later on
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:30:36
Dumbest shit I’ve seen

To up the ante you must wager something dickhead 
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:36:58
That’s what she said 
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:40:47
Followed by buy orders...
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:30:54
Don’t they expire today or tomorrow 
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:20:43
Yeah I’m not selling.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:22:58
Squeeze before the pump

It feels like a snake that’s about to strike
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:10:40
Been a min since a quick jump like that 
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:54:43
Wasn’t referring to  btw

@_date: 2018-06-10 18:56:26
There’s no way you actually did that 
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:38:30
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:24:17
Right after it hits 100k
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:42:35
You weren’t around for 2018 I presume
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:41:46
What a response
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:11:09
None of this makes sense. None of it...  the more powerful and technologically advanced this gets it drops in value.  Can I buy a vowel?
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:24:03
We’ve all decided that, although tipping is wonderful, kind, raises Lightning’s awareness... it’s a bit obnoxious to do it every single time. We’re taking pennies
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:53:36
4-5 % of your investment will be a minuscule amount in the coming years. Unless you own multiple coins.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:46:59
Well it’s legal now sooooo
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:24:57
I rarely have stop orders filled. Read about “maker orders” and “taker orders”.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:40:43
Go home... 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:19:25
The market wants to rise.  I just think its on hold 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:01:50
On the other hand...  it’s 8am in Korea 
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:41:23
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:12:30
Still is

Short rally by American money. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:30:13
You might as well go buy yourself a roll of scratch offs or wager it all on your favorite team cause quite frankly BTC DGAF about your guesses
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:27:06
What was it a month ago I took a day off when it hit 10k? Lol. R-E-L-A-X
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:46:33
There goes that chart pattern again.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:34:52
We will see it.  Nobody panic lol 
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:26:00
It’s fine
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:13:15
Wall Street is experiencing tough times today. Hoping this can set us up for a little run back to 5 digits!
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:25:24
Shouldn’t it 
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:15:06
14k by end of August would be superb. (Modest)
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:17:53
BOUGHT.... TFD
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:38:59
I appreciate you
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:06:07
11k is just sexy
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:39:29
Or you could simply just watch the first few dumps following a linear pattern and rally. No charts necessary 
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:47:45
Damn you might be right lol 
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:32:41
Which is why their being regulated and forced to secure themselves.  
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:15:44
Main reason is probes into price manipulation. The hack is almost fully recovered.  
I never understand how there can be 30 bits of good, 2 bits of bad and it causes drops.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:22:32
I’ll be here 
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:28:03
I can’t believe I was bull trapped
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:51:16
At least he’s consistent
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:58:43
Did you read all of that?!
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:38:56
Lol. Fine
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:30:17
You tell me when to sell big fellah
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:05:45
Welp... almost had a positive day. (I know... all days bitcoin is still going is a good day). It’s oversold.  Big days/months/years ahead
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:22:12
Nice 
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:15:37
It’s obviously a bull something Richard 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:36:52
But can you buy thing ALL OVER THE WORLD with it?  
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:15:43
That was poorly executed 
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:49:30
Just bought 100.  Let’s do it!
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:13:28
You too huh

The roller coaster meme has never been more prevalent
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:28:36
200 million worth ?  Or almost an even 500 in value or an even 10%. Lmao.  Cmon say it with me.  M-A-Niii
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:07:31
You’ve said nothing.  It’s simple 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:49:22
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:30:45
I guess I’ve just never understood time and effort put towards repulsiveness and negativity. It’s all a common interest. You can be my Shill antonym 
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:10:45
Love the tether news 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:59:35
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:55:16
Did you make that yourself 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:54:31
You can’t seriously know about the future and roller coasters can you 
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:47:40
Freak out and buy
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:47:53
I redact 
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:24:44
Wrong way!
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:38:45
Hahahaha ☝️
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:04:55
Alright buddy(1). Just saying... you surely could conquer great things with your unsupported negative fireside chats 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:04:07
You may have held for 2 months. Me as well.  I need a higher price. It could come.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:34:36
*jumps back in 3 days from now*
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:54:40

@_date: 2019-10-09 15:23:11
Kinda feels like we’re turning this thing around again.  To 16k by 11/1
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:53:08
This is a tug of war of 200$ proportions 
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:34:22
Nope. 
Nope. 
Nope.  Not a political sub. 
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:11:04
Let’s go again!
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:22:27
Yes. I’ve watched it do very close it that in just barely more time
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:38:33
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:57:19
That it pumped and there are more coming throughout the day 
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:55:33
I’m ready. *pokes it with a stick*
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:49:12
Are you sure or are you just inpatient 
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:53:39
Price is being kept here for a purpose unknown.  Fingers crossed 
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:48:21
Not going to kid anyone about the fact I had to look up *petulant*
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:42:43
It’s been a while 
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:15:32
But yeah... still not selling 
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:07:44
Kinda frustrating
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:17:47
Go home. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:37:48

Go home you’re drunk 
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:05:54

I can’t really figure out if you’re trolling or not... so if you are. Kudos. But I think it actually could so I’m doubting myself

Agreed. Me too.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:29:08
This is a very calculated event unfolding. This is called the regulation phase of BTC. Fear it. Have uncertainty about it. But most of all get excited.  As the market works to correct security issues (and it will) people will notice. Heavy, heavy pocketed individuals and business with their trillions of dollars locked away will flood this valley of current doubt and I’m gonna ride that fuckin wave waving my hand and smiling.

Yeah man. You can do that. But you’ll pay a lot more for the instant purchase. (Depends on how much you’re buying but for me it didn’t make sense)

What would you compare the chances of loosing all your money from your checking account (debit cards etc.) or losing all your bitcoin due to a paper wallet? I’d have to say they vary but aren’t too far apart?
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:07:13
I agree. It could go up or down. Hell, even Sideways!

@_date: 2019-06-04 23:15:26
There is an opposite side of that. You can stop loss. Or just limit sell. I’ve set both and nothing  triggered.  I would have about .3-.5 more BTC right now if those orders worked. That’s why I’m confused.  (Yes I guess these prices by blind luck. Don’t

@_date: 2019-10-23 12:59:20
There never is. Sites just simply put the BTC man on a roller coaster down and site “heavy resistance” due to this and that and act like it’s not manipulated.  I don’t care about my Reddit karma.  I’ll set up a booth so you fellas can tell me why this isn’t manipulated
@_date: 2019-06-05 15:17:57

@_date: 2019-10-30 14:40:59
Honestly, I love this game.  It never ceases to amaze me at its highs,  and it’s “lows”.  I believe in it nonetheless. I find myself pouting when the price drops, and jubilant when it’s skyrocketing. I wish, however, we could all stop with the extreme pettiness and devils advocate mentality. Whether you Short, long, or somehow attempt to day trade... quit shitting on each other. Good day sirs and madams.

However, it can also take a 18-22% loss and BTC drop 5%.  Buying Alts is exactly like cheating on your significant other. It’s exciting and dangerous... but sometimes you get caught and wish you would have remembered what you had at home.

@_date: 2019-10-16 12:18:47
In that order?
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:52:09
Coinbase allows withdraw in 5-6 days.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:58:31

@_date: 2019-10-25 23:08:28
Do more you big pussy
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:21:26
I see what you mean now. However for certain amounts it “recommends wire transfer” taking 2-3 days.  So either pay larger fee for instant buy or pay none for waiting. Which if I’m being completely honest... it’s saved me a lot of money cause I was trying to buy at 13.5 lol so today I’ll get it lower (seemingly)
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:58:41

No rhyme or reason typically.  Only speculative
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:43:46
How confident are YOU?  I’ve never known you to have any doubt at all... I personally believe we’re on the cusp of a major increase. BTC is making stride after stride with adoption and utilization techniques. I try not to predict day to day, but more months and years. Happy Friday Mr. Always.

It’s one of my favorite games
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:11:55
Meanwhile, children, BTC IS UP 188% in the last 3 months.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:41:13
That’s what I’ve been waiting for.  This is typical and if you just bought before this. You’re fine.

@_date: 2019-06-09 23:14:18
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:22:57
It may be due to being a level 1 customer. I’ve been at it for quite some time so my limits are higher both ways.  Use Coinbase Pro though.

Come on 10k and a day off ������
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:05:11
I could super use about 4500 soon. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:19:27
You’re telling me! I thought that was funny myself.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:13:53
Like most things in life... it’s only temporary and this too shall pass 
@_date: 2019-06-01 00:55:28
Happy with today honestly
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:38:00
I just keep waiting lol 
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:36:43
I know I’ve Mentioned this toooo many times and it will be unpopular... but... where is the shocking pullback that triggers weak handed sell off? (Like the 17k to 14k flash sale in 2017) I know this time “could be different” but damn.
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:09:08
I thought this was okay as a response lol
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:54:00
Okay... this is okay... 
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:24:54
Hmm. I can only see deposits that have gone through already. More interested in “pending transactions” or incoming ones (say from a betting site) like you can see on Coinbase regular
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:39:21
The whales will push you and push you until you consider giving up.. Don’t Give away your position. HODL your piece of Property in the digital land of freedom.

With no bullish response, I’m starting worry that this run up to a new ATH is premature. I hate to say it. Let’s see what Asia does with this.
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:25:04
Keep selling lmao. Whooooooops
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:02:55
I sold way too early because I have my first child coming. My gains paid for all of the medical bills that had piled up. Felt responsible.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:35:52
Yes, I’ll have the giant green Candle please with 8 beers.

This one seemed too obvious 
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:25:05
Thank you though
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:19:22
Does anyone know on Coinbase Pro if/where you can see incoming transfers of BTC and confirmations (if there are any) similar to how you can see it on the Regular Coinbase app? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:59:07
Totally normal.  Nothing to see here
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:00:04
Even when it goes up lol. Your trolling attempts are futile 
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:50:15
I just keep thinking there will be A major 10-12% correction any day. But it keeps going up. I’ve ridden this roller coaster too many times lol

Hello. ��

I wouldn’t call anyone an idiot who profited off a risky investment. But yeah, not intelligent.

How long can this go on
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:27:12
Keep acting as if I actively make predictions. (Use your eyes to look at recent trends chief) I’m usually not argumentative but TBH... You’re just being a dick because I’m not making cookie cutter Rah-Rah comments that make you feel better about your position.

Guess we will see 6’s in the EST morning
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:12:39
Took me a long time to stop lying to myself.  Don’t get me wrong... still not selling.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:13:45
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:12:32

I read more about it after the fact. But. Now I know. Only a 400$ mistake ??

I would be very careful about shorting this or day trading. I got lucky yesterday but at 6500... support could bounce this thing right off 7ks rear end and further.  Best to Hodl

@_date: 2019-06-06 14:45:22
I made .14 yesterday selling at the beginning of the day and buying back late evening.  First time if ever done it.  Lucky. Very lucky.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:54:53
What if I told you that 7500 would be the lowest price for the rest of 2019?
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:09:13

It’s hard to say. I’m often wrong about investing and sometimes the timing thereof. But what I think this market needs is a little less speculation and FUD. We need a little more cock and balls and the confidence that THIS!!! THE WORLDS FIGHT AGAINST LIES AND CORRUPTION CAN BE TAKEN BY US, the PEOPLE. AAAAAGGHHHHHHHHH!   I’m drunk but hot damn am I inspired. Night everyone.
@_date: 2019-12-04 01:38:23

I’m also buying dips again lol 
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:37:43
These news articles are hilarious.  It’s either “here’s why bitcoin will hit 100k” or how it’s “primed for the big crash”. Aka. They dunno

Yeah man.  Time wasn’t built in a day

Very true.  I don’t root against it.  (Or really anyone in their endeavors here). But alts just scare me occasionally.

Cowardice folk come out to play when times are harder on others. They group together forming a cluster of fuckery also known as a “cluster fuck.”  They’re basically young girls with a voice

@_date: 2018-11-20 20:30:43
Oh yeah 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:25:27
Do you simply sign into your coinbase account or how do you go about this?

@_date: 2018-11-15 15:35:43
Soooo what’s supposed to happen when the SHIT forks?   Do ppl think it’s like Y2K   Why the animosity?

It feels good to own a whole coin. It would feel better if it was worth what I bought it for 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:44:13
I’ll say that it’s fun to watch lol 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:51:46
I feel like I’m talking to whale produced FUD bots 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:26:50
It’s really no different than an experienced CPA finding “loopholes” to avoid paying higher taxes. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:25:08
This stuff gives me that feeling.  I’ve bought dips and been pretty successful.   But now... ?
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:36:03
Everything has a representative. It’s like your parents homie 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:33:03

Time to buy. Start with something comfortable.   See how it goes. Position buy from there. ( up and down.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:49:54
I really just want 1 day. 1 that’s like yes !  Bullish babay!!  But it uh hasn’t been that way for weeks 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:06:06
I don’t need your shit lol   
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:48:42
It’s okay to worry. Bitcoin has had ppl worrying for years right. Somehow it always comes back around. Technology and history thinks it may again. Hope. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:01:20
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:52:12
Well you do them as a part of your personal return and it’s a simple percentage of your earnings or in most cases losses this year. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:13:35
You obviously dunno how big his rims are 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:42:03
Still waiting for that 6500  Mark then breakout 
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:05:45
I don’t think I could look at any more insight, or charts and have any idea where this goes... however, the charts look exactly like the ones from dot com era abs the nasdaq...  just saying.  I hope it goes to 30k by December. But every man for themselves. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:02:20
Anyone heard of a quarter, look forward to next quarter 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:10:34
Simply no way this tech goes away.  Screenshot it. Write it down. Recite it.    No way 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:39:04
I like that 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:35:03
Yeah. For now 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:29:07
How many times do we have to disprove this argument and trolling statement? How many? I’ve watched you use this 15 times.  Someone explains why it’s different but you don’t seem to understand.

There’s a lot of March madness go around. Could we possibly see an improvement in the technology and in influx in money. Big money?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:10:58
Did it lol 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:59:12
You’re so smart. You must have so much money from your intelligence I can’t imagine you even have time to be here. Thank you for gracing us. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:46:13
Oh I just sit around dreaming of 6k. Fuuuck off.  Mods... delete this comment as it needed to be said. I’ve read no rules of reverse trolling.

Unless your paychest is pretty damn good I can’t imagine having to wait to invest lol

I’m commenting to see how far to the right it will actually go. Sorry.

The Dow wiped out its earnings for the entire year today.  No coincidence?
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:33:31
At least I can balance out my 1099 with all my capital losses. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:50:36
This argument is incredibly vague and uneducated.

This activity is fairly typical for sideways movement for a week or longer.  I’m still here. 2 BTC in wallets. Waiting for launch sequence.

I’m with you man lol 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:38:40
Was speaking to my father in-law about BTC yesterday over lunch. I told him I’d pissed away tons of money in the last year...  he knows almost nothing about it but his only words were “Hmmm. Well. I would imagine you’ve lost nothing unless you’ve sold it.”  Hes 70 and doesn’t invest in anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:03:47
It will all work out. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:03:42
It was a legitimate question. Thanks for the essay answer. B+
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:18:12
What’s the angle here? What do his words mean 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:45:15

There really isn’t too much to consider with coin. You’re either an early adopter or you’re not. Are you still early if you buy today? Maybe 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:58:51

Lol.  Here comes April.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:15:56
I imagine that’s how 2014/15 felt 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:59:26
Crazy how we speculate it will go down... in a speculative market, and it DOES 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:14:33
Quit questioning the inevitable. BTC is the future. No articles need to be read.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:34:43
Damn son. I feel like you just provided him with a second asshole. I’m sort of proud and I don’t know you.

What’s your 10 year prediction asshat 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:09:58
Well... considering the coins I bought in the 3’s. Yes. It would be like my own personal Moon 
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:15:31
Or that are greedy, deceptive, or skilled 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:22:22

For the 376th time. Bye 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:52:52
I dunno you man. But yes...  it’s either going to or not right?! I look at it way too much. I tell my friend and I that we need to delete the apps and check back in May 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:31:49
Especially since this has happened 4 times in the last 5 years.  Keep fishing. You’ll catch something, surely 
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:07:14
That math is fairly difficult to pinpoint. You have to calculate market cap, market dominance percentage. Then take the percentage gained based on current price.  Fuckin a lot 
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:25:55
I just want a good day/week/ hell glimmer of hope 
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:53:36

Yeah he’s got this backasswards 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:44:16
Honestly this might be the only way to Moon. Send it so low it’s affordable again. Sounds childish but... looking for answers.  Reaching. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:20:43
Otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:36:33
Can someone do the math for me on a 100$ straight line drop and how much of a dump that is.   It doesn’t seem possible. Buuut it is 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:24:03
I don’t get it big Pete.  What the hell.

That made me laugh so hard for some reason. I think there’s enough momentum to make it happen by End of February
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:35:05
I have the same feels 
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:11:36
This is so frustrating 
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:15:14
Well then ... I apologize. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:35:03
Got em 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:47:24
I’m fine with both 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:26:53
If this is indeed the making of a bull trap it’s pretty well effin orchestrated.  Fomoing out my mouth currently
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:40:40
I honestly think that’s what’s happening though. Because my earning when we go green are going up higher than the rate at which I bought in. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:08:40
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:56:56
I gotta say it... I’ve dumped plenty of time and money into this. I still explain it to ppl although sometimes there are tough questions to answer.  But damn... BTC is like the prom queen who got super fat.  Isn’t it time she got pretty again!!??
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:23:07
And it’s where I Fomod in this morning.

I think you mean half to 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:10:47
Question: going to out myself as s gambler but hey I’m not alone....  when I send BTC to the gaming site at lets say 500$ at 3500. Let’s imagine (hope) I win 500$ so I send 1000 now USD back to my BTC wallet at a 3500 or similar price.  Considering I bought in at higher prices... am I essentially washing my BTC average lower?
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:29:08
Closer than before chief

Btc was once in a funk for 3 years.  Why is everyone selling lol

Look at the week chart.  It’s fluctuating within a defined range.  This “dip” and “support” falls within other than the pump we had a few days back.

@_date: 2018-11-30 14:09:49

@_date: 2018-03-16 13:24:08
Woah. Jumps lol 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:18:34
Okay I gotta ask. Why the spelling of HODL
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:39:12
Why the volume 
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:07:41
I simply don’t understand the negativity. “Drop to 5k already!”  Why. Why would you want that.  I don’t care if the charts say that’s what supposed to happen. What in the hellll is typical about crypto.  Fight back to 8500, then to 9.  Then to 11.  Drop to 5. Jesus

@_date: 2018-03-24 02:18:55

This is complete bull shit   No one posts that.  They just kill themselves 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:14:10
So you’re thought process is that there are enough buyers with enough money (who don’t know about bitcoin or aren’t all in already) to make a bull run sustainable enough to be an actual run? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:07:23

The feeling your parents had... 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:29:33
But when it goes to 8500 by morning everyone here will be like oh man! Oh man! We’re mooning. It’s really happening.  Goes down 5%.  World over 
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:15:08
I totally agree. But I’m in a green sorta mood. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:42:00
Don’t sell it short.  I’m a firm believer of 15 by end of October 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:36:12
Fill me in on that. I’m soecilating that means hold but I’m sorry???

Nope.  Ppl short.  They won’t allow runs.   It can happen for both sides dudes (and cool chicks). This game works both ways.  
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:01:00
I don’t think anyone feels comfortable right now: longers, or shorters...  I like that.

As per the analysis?  What about “as per” grammar... does that count in your nonsense.  -99 karma 
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:01:18
There will be ETFs.  There will. Members of the SEC will see it through and are currently bashing the decision 
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:25:03
They’re trying so hard right now to lower the price.  With every tiny attempt to go higher, immediate drop.

What about Monday? What does Monday look like!!??!!
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:52:10
Typically when I see volume high, price rises shortly after.  Is that correct? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:58:31
So it’s stable a few days and it’s crap. Ok. Your Econ class called. You’ve been purged 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:06:15
Uhhh. I think it’s doing it again

People have been afraid of regulation for years. It causes fear in crypto. Oddly enough, it’s necessary.  Needed. Crypto shows it can provide a safe and stable platform (which it already is but only ~65%) we will grow way more substantially

Dude, futures and shorting.   The only thing I’ve read is by a redditor I despise. However, if I would have followed his scheme this past month I could have quit my job. “Short every rally”.  I think it’s a shit way to “invest” but it could ya e worked.  I’m over all this crap.  A few pumps to keep me around... the. Huge inorganic dumps.

My question once again is why you’re here.  You offer no insight... you’re statements have no validity. You troll, because you have nowhere else to be. Maybe get in your 3k Tahoe with you’re 4K rims and limp into the sunset

Thanks bro. Appreciate the advice. I’m not happy it’s dropping. It’s demoralizing... however, I also watched (without buying) it go from 1,000 to 20k and finally bought in at 8k. I’ve no doubt it will be above 8 k in 2018. But these dips can and will control your whole day if you allow it. No one has ever been buried with dollars or digital coins. Aaron Rodgers: RELAX

Why “Person”
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:30:56
See you soon big guy.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:04:49
Your boy and his strong hands has held for over a year.  And we’re square one.  Let’s. Fucking. Roll.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:02:00
Oh okay
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:42:43
Y’all just haven’t BTC bull ran.  This will be fun.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:53:07
I just feel like I’ve seen it all in this space. I’m pretty jaded to pumps and dumps. I’m just here for the delicious popcorn and ATH’s
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:33:53
Nah. Lol I need a day off
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:20:28
Someone really doesn’t think 6 k is good right now.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:37:41
It’s like the whole day happened in 2 minutes and 37 seconds ��
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:13:57
I loooove limit orders
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:11:30

@_date: 2019-05-28 21:20:39
Memorial Day hangover.

Trust me. I’m all for it. Just have BTC Winter PTSD
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:41:55
My Doc at work and I talked about BTC for 2 hours today during and after lunch. He bought a coin like it was no problem.  Then he proceeded to watch the price allll afternoon lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:04:25
Really like BitScreener
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:42:28
That’s what I see coming. “Crash” lol
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:19:09
Lol. It’s done this for 3 pump cycles. Lol what’s the crying?!
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:12:18
Congrats. Hope you wake up to 8800
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:35:52
When I log in, it doesn’t show my bitcoin wallet funds. ???
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:25:48
Happy holidays.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:40:25
Anyone who is really knowledgeable about this space wouldn’t necessarily care about the ETF decision, right?
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:37:54
Going back above 7k for the day WOULD be a nice signal though
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:27:54
Now that I’m even in my investment... I can’t stop checking price again. ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:40:57
Lmao. BTC doesn’t normally have “events” per say. But game of thrones is over... and 60 minutes did air.  So let’s tune in to see what happens on the next episode of Who wants to be a Millionaire!?
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:31:44
Yeahh. You can’t  do that lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:06:26
To 7650——&gt;8700 —— &gt;9300
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:40:31
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:04:50
Cmon 6 k.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:38:21
This train will Not stop moving. We’ve come from the depths of winter to a place I was worried we’d never see. Don’t be fooled by what seem to be “scary” trading activities.  Wouldn’t be surprised at all to see 9k again by Saturday. Choo-Choo coiners
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:12:18
Where’s the guy who was boasting about getting out at 7900 and his friend giving me a hard time about giving him a hard time? Hodl!
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:46:52
Here we go
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:42:20
Fully expect a few more along the stairway to space.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:22:43
Here comes another.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:34:30
Yeah man. Said it 2 days ago
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:40:43
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:29:57
Lol. You see these squeezes too huh lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:43:54
Not all bulls run at the same speed
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:43:20
Nawh, you’re looking for subscribers to pay you money. Which you’ll probably buy with.  Cmon.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:38:20
For my own personal gains. I also don’t believe in Santa Claus, chief.  Good?
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:52:13
Well... I’ve simply been a hardcore Hodler who bought in last year at current prices.  THIS is a game changer. Thank you again. 
I think it’s a great time for BTC. I’m even now.  So I’m just going to take a break for a small time.  If it drops, cool. I’ll obtain a better position.  If it goes up.  Good for everyone else.  I just FINALLY feel relieved.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:12:35
I often get that feeling when we hover. It’s as if the whales say... “Fine... if no one wants to buy here, let’s take it down.”
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:59:29
It’s been that way for over a year now lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:20:58
Jaded to them. Comes with the space. Always has.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:51:36
I’m very excited about the giddy up from 3.5 to here. I’m not usually, but I feel uneasy today. I wasn’t going to sell at my breakeven point (8700) anyway. This feels like an emotional slap in the mouth though.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:11:53
Kinda reminds me of Sunday.  Yes. Lol this past Sunday we did this before rising. It’s fine.
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:10:39
The bears pressed the wrong key. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:34:46
Go get em tiger
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:52:58
If you can see it and it can make you money it is for sure real 
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:07:32
Did we really just drop 200 from a 60 minute segment
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:08:15
Now this is your HONEST opinion right? 
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:26:38
Huh. What was that
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:29:38
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:52:44
The halving is coming
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:47:37
Finishing the day above 7800 would be a great sign of support
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:42:31

I have planned my 10k celebration. I have a PTO day lined up
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:15:55
Short it 
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:43:52
They too must stop to eat and rest.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:18:56
One of these mornings I’m going to wake up and be overwhelmed with excitement again. For now... I’m simply excited that it’s not lower than when I went to bed. And no. I can’t stop checking. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:59:06
Haha. Cmon. Bust through!!!
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:59:17
You ever seen anything happen in a classic fashion with this?
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:28:56
analysts DID say we’d be going to 3k before back to 4500. So hopefully you’re correct. I’m really really interested to see what happens at 2990.  My orders are set 
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:13:23
Typically I’m just grasping at straws lol
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:12:39
I read that this morning. Guess we’re all searching for answers 
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:20:25
Are we talking about the same consensus that produced absolutely nothing in the way of gains last year?
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:47:00
Great. Happy effing new year 
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:03:25
Bold statement
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:10:05
I wish someone would teach me how to access coinbase Pro. I’m so tired of coinbase’s ridiculous fees

We can leave this person alone now. They’ve been educated enough. K. Cool.
@_date: 2019-05-28 21:36:48
Sitting here KNOWING this will Bart.  Actually I know nothing. Gut feeling.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:37:01
Why 150?  Not 137.68��
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:53:46
Good funny or satire funny?!

8k is like a child playing Peekaboo
@_date: 2019-05-31 11:33:35
Some days it’s hard to see the truth ��
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:47:53
But seriously. Expect pullbacks. This is going to 8k then pullback. 16-20% is as much as it ever does in a day
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:06:35
People who troll comments from hours ago (which are obviously optimistic and hopeful) are unoriginal and lack ability to think for themselves. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:16:45
It’s fine... I’ll wait
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:27:04
Thank you sir

@_date: 2019-05-30 20:47:32
Break even for almost everyone
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:24:41
I’m just happy
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:38:43
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:31:10
Come on ��
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:34:47
I would smile ear to ear if we can reverse this Bart and get back to 9 k this weekend.

All for it
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:17:06
Tell that to the people who purchased homes and vehicles with their “dividends” 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:35:01
Really hard to say.  I just know that speculative folks would probably sell because it would complete the typical chart formation
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:36:35
No reasons have ever been needed for BTC price fluctuations. Learn to accept them.  Become them. Remember endgame.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:30:24
THE FOMO!!!
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:11:16
I don’t make the charts.

Yeah. Chill

Dive right in dragon man 
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:53:07
By saying if he doesn’t care about it, then sell.. makes it sound like if he wants to lose money, hold it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:09:55
Flash Sale. (Grits teeth)
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:55:05
That would give me a small panic attack
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:08:18
Mine is 7800

Uhhh. It’s one pull back. One of many along this road
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:18:05
It’s like the step ladder to hell.
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:23:40
If you had any idea how to make money investing you would be doing so.  You would be here telling others how Not to lose money. Gfy 
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:29:27

You’re the worst. Your perspectives arent thought out. Your viewpoints on TAs are illegitimate, and you’ve never said anything I agree with. I’m sorry your life is so miserable. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:09:33
Because it’s depressing.

@_date: 2018-12-20 17:08:34
Nawh. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:58:17
To do so, do you simply create a sell order which converts it to USD?
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:40:54
Dude you’re awesome. Thank you. So let’s say I have X amount of funds in the “Pro” USD wallet. Can I do the same with a “limit buy order”?

Unlike human beings, whales are conscious breathers, which means they have to remember to breathe, even while sleeping. ... They either “rest quietly in the water, vertically or horizontally, or sleep while swimming slowly next to another animal.”
So, long story short, someone is always watching.

Why not 10K in May? Has a terrific ring to it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:26:26
Well... I suppose it’s time for action. From a semi ignorant standpoint , market would pull back before jumping ~ 9800   BUT it’s tried to dip and won’t. So. Let’s go up. Happy weekend times! ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:55:13
Wellll shit 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:50:13

I’m still very annoyed though as I was 400 away from break even. Going to be a ton of resistance based on thousands of people in my position who will get out when they do. (I’m not but ya know)

A finish at 15 k at the end of the year (very unlikely) would make me a very happy person lol   Just bought BTC

For such a liberal idea of value, the BTC mods sure stick to the script! AMIRITE
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:20:49

Sideways all weekend for U.S. trading due to holiday.  Just assuming.  We all know how assumptions go in BTC land.

Only drawing on logic, hype, and crappy Wall Street days.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:30:55
I had that feeling the whole time it went from 6k to 7k and then to 8.5k
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:55:40
Lol. Only time over ever agreed with you but yes. It is funny.... For NOOOWWWW
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:33:09
There ARE* a bunch. You cannot grammatically fuck up and expect to be taken seriously at all. 
Also, if 2k did happen... wouldn’t it (BTC) still be going? Okay. Thanks.

Downvoting has been known to alleviate butthurt

@_date: 2018-12-14 18:31:41
We’re with ya man. It’s just simple minded folk doing their chores. That’s all 
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:05:40
There are times that I believe that “Whales” and driving forces behind bull runs need a period of accumulation theirselves.   I think now is that time. I think a dip to 7200 or so could could before the train up to 10k

It’s entertaining.  You have to account for the fact that MOST of the weak hands are new weak hands due to recent price increase.  They will fall off quicker than weak hands of the past.

Hello bounce. It’s nice to see you 
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:16:41
I personally check in to make sure you haven’t made any progress with your troll game. ��
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:16:55
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:38:17
I think both of you believe this because it’s gone lower and not gained traction. So you’re simply observing trends
