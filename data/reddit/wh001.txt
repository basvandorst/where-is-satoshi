That is a good idea! I'm not sure of the willingness for the vendors to spill their secrets but it might be worth a shot. I don't know too much about the darknet but I'd imagine they have the same problem haha

From my understanding, gains would have to be realized when they are converted. Wouldn't I have to have a full record for a tax professional to be able to calculate the value at the time of conversion (lets say from an altcoin to BTC) to be able to determine that?

Thanks for the clarification! That is what my understanding was also. Wouldn't your solution be for if I had simply held and then sold to USD now without any sort of conversions? I thought you pay taxes every time the BTC was converted and made a gain. That is the problem I am having due to not having a complete record history.

I am actually serious. The mistake has been made and now I am trying to find a solution. I guess I am asking people for what they would do in my shoes.

Would there be any problems with Amazon if the cards were purchased with stolen credit cards? If someone came knocking on my door asking me to prove I purchased the gift cards from a seller, I feel like I couldn't say anything besides the fact that I purchased them with Bitcoins and they dig deeper to find that I didn't pay capital gains. Especially if I would be buying many gift cards.

The proof that I reported everything is the problem. Without a full trace of everything, the estimated maximum amount paid could be wrong. If I made a transaction and gained $1,000,000 (I would have to pay taxes on that) and then lost $900,000 later on and then gained a little more later (again, taxed), then realistically, I would have to pay more taxes at the end than just the taxes on what I currently have.

I would love to if it was that easy. There are very few records of all of the transactions within the last 3 years. I fully admit I was dumb and should have done things differently. No doubt about that.
If you could provide a good way to cash out in fiat and then pay the full tax amount on the $90k, I would love to hear it. Hence why I am even considering methods of setting up a fake donation address meant to have all my Bitcoins come back to it and then cash it out and pay the tax.
I honestly want to just pay the taxes and cash it all out if there was a way.

Art seems like a great idea, but I have no experience with it :/
