Do/can we have a slack channel for discussion?

Out of curiosity, how many employees does bitfinex have?
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:47:13
Hmm, no replies for more than 8 hours. This makes me worried...
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:42:51
I don't think so...
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:35:04
Too bad no more announcement today.

That's the spirit. Myself also has USD balance only, and I'm prepared for the worst case scenario. We're born empty-handed, and we will die in the same way.

If it declares bankruptcy, where would the remaining digital tokens go?

Thanks for your effort...

I know Bitfinex has limited manpower. Care to share how many employees does the company have? It's ok if it cannot be revealed. Thx

I thought you are in HongKong. Anyway, don't give up

According to 
"Multisig cold wallets to hold crypto-currencies
We have been using multisig addresses for cold storage since the beginning of December 2014. The vast majority of customer bitcoins are stored in the cold wallets. We do not store more than 0.5% of our assets on hot wallets. Our hot wallets are not accessible from the front-end servers."
Does bitfinex use cold storage or not? Typo?

How long does it take to review the announcement? Are we expecting to hear anything from BFX today? (August 6th 2016)

"However, there is also much to worry about. The BitFinex source code is based on the notoriously insecure Bitcoinica source code that was leaked in July, and one forum poster, Davout, found that one could use one of the same exploits against Bitfinex that worked against Bitcoinica when it was still operational: set the leverage to 10,000, put in a small amount of money, and wait for the price to move. "
Could it be possible that the hacker took the similar approach for the exploit?

Any VC/company interested in bitfinex? Just wondering...
