So, it's time to talk about ni23457 (a fraudster who wanted to cheat ChangeNOW). **ni23457 decided to blackmail, and buys shills on Reddit.** Proof of the  It's been a few days and I see the same messages from a lot of redditors. **They post the same thing - spam!** Here they are:
Check yourself. **Their messages are copypast!**

ChageNow = mee? Oh no, are you ill? This story is interesting to me, so I decided to follow it. I admit, in the beginning I supported ni23457, but then I realized that this person hides a lot. This is not an accident, so I'm watching him and his bots.

**I'll add, guys, that andyrgreig is a troll that pays ni23457.** This crook wanted to fool the exchange by sending a fake ID. The deception was revealed, and now he buys the votes of Reddit. Look  There are other trolls 
They write the same, only what that want ni23457. Be careful, do not believe what people say. ni23457 blackmails the exchange, trying to get coins without confirmation of identity.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:08:11


Now he distributes unverified information on the Internet, forgetting to mention that he sent fake ID twice. Do you think an honest person did the same? It's like blackmail!

How you can comment on this, scammer? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:05:19
No, I understand perfectly! I see here the data of some people, who are they? Do you think you can achieve anything? You blame someone, laying out their data, but what do we know about you, Mr. Shadow? Tell me who you are! No? You're pathetic, stop doing nonsense.
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:22:09
Dear ni23457! I think you're not only an idiot, but also an unfortunate rascal. Why are you writing this nonsense? You say, "Your gang has no right to manipulate votes and send false complaints.", But you are so dumb that **you openly offered money for lying**. Do you think you deleted your message? No, you blockhead, it's the Internet! See that  What do you say, Mr. loser?
@_date: 2018-08-26 11:58:50
I think you're an idiot! Than you will justify the words? I know you, you selling shit, look here  **I want to BUY MUCH VOICES! I will pay a lot. I have a lot of money!** So says ni23457 and now you start squealing here OMG! What a stupid trol!
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:34:32
Boom! What do you say about it, Mr. Liar. I still do not hear from you a comment. 
**«I want to BUY MANY VOTES! I will pay a lot. I have a lot of money!»** What is the price of a lie?
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:24:43
If someone decided to change the office, this does not mean that he ran LOL. ni23457, only you manipulate the voices. Here,  you buy votes for $ 2.

Rating says only that people are not able to analyze the facts!
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:06:31
This guy had a problem after sending a fake ID. Now he spreads this shit, misleading everyone. You can read this review.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:38:23
**Your words are absolutely not true.** The coins have already been returned to this guy, but I think it would have happened earlier if he had not sent a fake ID.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:18:22
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:32:06


This is his personal opinion, and I do not intend to discuss such things with you. If he were you, I would have explained to him. You = nobody, just a pathetic troll!
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:01:33
I again see this spam from  Guys, this man is spreading lies, as described in this review.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:01:27
Dude, this rating doesn’t say anything, although you can consider it to be your little victory. There are facts, and they tell me that the guy who created the review about you was damn right when he claimed that you spread false information in order to discredit the exchange.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:42:46
**I think you should stop spreading false information that doesn't make sense.** I will to add my comment in order to clear it up a bit. This guy sent a fake, and after that he accuses changenow of fraud? This is a very stupid act. The user launched an information attack on the company, all the facts were kindly collected by one of the enthusiasts. You can read about it here. 
In early October, the coins was returned to the user, after a thorough investigation. This demonstrates the legality of the company, which operates within the law.
