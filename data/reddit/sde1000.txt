1. If your wallet doesn't broadcast the transaction, the POS system can't see the payment!  This has been a problem with some wallets in the past.  They seem to have been better recently.
2. Bitcoin transactions don't reliably come with a change address.  At some point I intend to add support for the bitcoin payment protocol, which does support change/refund addresses.  (In the short term I'll probably do this by integrating bitpay support into the POS, because they already support the payment protocol.)
3. It's about £1000-worth per month across my five pubs.

We accept unconfirmed transactions, so they are essentially instant.  We figure the risk of a double-spend for a small, in-person transaction is low — and if someone does try it, we can always take their drink off them...

My thinking when setting that policy was that when Bitcoin goes through one of its occasional extreme bubbles, I don't want to end up offering ludicrously high rates just before the crash - hence using the 7-day prices rather than the 24-hour ones.
I'm open to suggestions!  Another policy I considered was using the 24-hour prices but limiting daily rate increases to something like 10%.

The till software uses the [python-qrcode]( library to generate the QR code from the bitcoin: URL.  When it's displaying the code on the screen it uses Unicode block drawing characters.
Our receipt printers are Epson TM-U220s - 8-pin dot matrix.  The driver takes the "matrix" output from the python-qrcode library and generates bitmap printing instructions directly.  I have to overprint four times to get a nice sharp QR code on the paper!  Writing that code really took me back to the early 1980s - it's just like driving the Epson FX-80...
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:36:44
No particular reason; I'm open to using thermal printers for receipts.  They'd be quieter and faster!  We started out in 2004 using the TM-U220 and we just haven't changed since.

Whether the user includes a fee is not under our control!  Surely the wallet should default to including an appropriate fee and require the user to override this if they wish to send a zero-fee transaction?
@_date: 2013-09-08 12:31:57
I also accept Bitcoin payments in my pubs.  Bitcoin Wallet on Android is the wallet we have least problems with - but it's not perfect yet.  Sometimes it gets stuck with a transaction not being transmitted; to give it a "kick" and get it to try again I can use the "Disconnect" option and then start the app again.  Sometimes it has the opposite problem - it says the transaction has not yet been transmitted when it's actually already been received!  It stays in that state until the transaction is included in a block.
It would be nice if there was a menu option for "retransmit this transaction now", until the problem has been completely worked out.
blockchain.info is the wallet we have the most problems with - most of the time the transaction appears on their website but doesn't reach our Bitcoin node until it's eventually included in a block.
@_date: 2013-07-01 15:18:50
Even if we were *only* taking Bitcoin, there are still ways for members of staff to defraud us, but they are considerably reduced!  Details really matter here: for example, they could pour a drink and then pass their own Bitcoin address to the customer!  Detecting this kind of fraud would be easier than with cash, though: a suspicious customer could ask the management whether the address they sent their payment to is really one of ours.

I'm a director of the company that runs the pubs.
It's a bit early to have encountered any legal barriers - it's only been working for a week!  I've tried to set things up so that the pub company (a UK Ltd company) doesn't handle Bitcoins at all: it only ever receives payments in GBP.  From an accounting point of view, accepting Bitcoins is being made to look just like accepting debit and credit cards: there's an external "merchant services provider" (me in a personal capacity) that deals with all the currency conversion stuff.
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:26:42
The Bitcoin address is supplied as a QR code - a fresh address per transaction.  The biggest danger from a UI point of view is paying twice (and if that happens, I can send a refund once the transactions are confirmed).

@_date: 2013-06-23 23:59:33
Absolutely not.  I have had more problems with the blockchain.info app than with any other Android Bitcoin wallet.
The problem is that, when you send a transaction from the app, around 50% of the time it is not broadcast into the Bitcoin network.  It sits around on the blockchain.info servers in an "unconfirmed" state.  Sometimes these transactions eventually make it into a block, and sometimes they just vanish after several days.

Unfortunately, parts of the configuration files are code.  For example:
    # Price policy function
    def pembury_pricepolicy(sd,qty):
        # Start with the standard price
        price=sd['saleprice']*qty
        if sd['dept']==4 and qty==2.0: price=price-0.50 # Spirit doubles
        if sd['dept']==1 and qty==4.0: price=price-1.00 # 4pt jugs
        return price
I'm sure I could come up with a declarative system for this, but it wouldn't be as flexible.  Ultimately I would prefer this kind of configuration to be in the database rather than the config files, but there's a bit of a step between here and there...

I don't mind the publicity, it's just slightly frustrating sometimes: spend three months working on a new pub, get one article in a local paper.  Spend two evenings integrating Bitcoin payments into the pub EPOS system, suddenly everyone wants to know!

I am assuming that blockchain.info has its own private connections to some mining pools, or that it periodically retransmits unconfirmed transactions.  My own node is well connected - it's in a datacenter and typically has around 20 connections open at once.

The main cost of accepting cash is how much the banks charge you to pay it in to a bank account.  "Free banking" is for individuals; businesses pay.  The 0.8% I mentioned is the fee from our current bank.  (We are looking to change, but the reduction will be minor.)
Another cost is the staff time it takes to count the stuff!  We are paying for at least an hour of staff time per day for cash handling.
Cash losses are also an issue - even if the loss itself is small, investigating it takes even more staff time.
The POS system we use was written by me (we needed one that had integrated stock control back in 2004, and I couldn't find one at any kind of decent price, so I wrote one).  It's written in Python and runs on Linux.  (And would probably run on just about anything else if I bothered to try.)  The main reason I haven't open-sourced it is that the management interface is a bit raw and undocumented!
The Bitcoin-related part of it is very small; in the POS software itself it's mostly to do with displaying and printing QR codes.  There's a 500-line Django-based server on our VPN that handles generating new Bitcoin addresses and telling the POS systems whether Bitcoin transactions have been paid or not.  Converting Bitcoins to GBP is currently done manually by me; I'm still experimenting with different methods (hence the test transaction through bitpay I mention above).

A PNG would be much less useful in this context.
1. The till display is in text mode, and can't show arbitrary PNGs
2. The driver for the receipt printer can't print arbitrary graphics.
python-qrcode is a nice, small, simple library.  What's "overkill" about it?

My losses were less than I would have paid in credit card fees, but greater than what it would have cost me to accept cash.  (Credit card fees: 1.4%; my losses: 1.2%; accepting cash 0.8%)
On the other hand, it's a week later now and my percentage losses are smaller!  It's not inconceivable that I might make a small profit soon.
The £15 bank transfer fee that appeared on my test transaction through bitpay really hurt; if that hadn't been there, I would have broken even already.  They don't advertise it up front (at least, I can't find it mentioned anywhere on their website).

The blockchain.info app is shiny, but it's the only one we've actually had problems with - sometimes it doesn't broadcast the transaction over the Bitcoin network, so we don't get to see it until it's somehow eventually included in a block - often several hours or days later.

I think I'm using "rate" the opposite way around to you; I'm talking about GBP per BTC rather than BTC per GBP.  So as I write this it's £86.36 per BTC and in the pubs I am accepting payments at £79.45 per BTC (which is about what the rate was a week ago).  When I say "limiting daily rate increases" I'm talking about limiting the rate at which I increase my offer of GBP for BTC.
The reason I might want to do this is that there is a delay between when I accept the Bitcoins and when I'm able to exchange them for GBP, so I am vulnerable to changes in the exchange rate in the meantime.  I don't want to have to withdraw the facility for people to pay in BTC when the exchange rate is varying rapidly, I just don't want to leave myself overly exposed if there is a rapid rise in GBP per BTC followed by a crash.
I'm offering this facility for people's convenience (and, partly, as an interesting experiment).  If people sometimes choose not to use it and to pay me in cash instead, I'm happy with that too!

VAT is actually shown on that receipt, it's just on the part that's been cut off at the bottom of the photo.  The price you can see on the part of the receipt shown is the VAT-inclusive price.
(When selling to end-users, UK companies are obliged to show VAT-inclusive prices.  It's only companies that sell primarily to other companies [wholesalers, etc.] that are allowed to advertise VAT-exclusive prices.)

For thermal printers, I expect this could could be made simpler - there would be no need for overprinting.  The till code isn't open source yet, mostly because I'm not completely happy with it.  (It's showing its age in many ways, for example it mostly still uses embedded SQL to access the database; I'm in the process of converting it to use the sqlalchemy ORM.)

When I added the Norwich pub to a couple of "where can I spend Bitcoin?" sites, one of them said they wouldn't list the pub unless the website described how the pub accepted Bitcoins.  So, I wrote [the webpage](  It started to get more attention than I anticipated, so I figured I ought to email the managers of the other pubs and let them know what was happening!
My original plan had been to visit the other pubs myself and check it was all working ok before announcing it.  I won't get around most of them, though, until the end of next week - I'm covering for the managers of the Norwich pub who are away on honeymoon at the moment.  Accepting Bitcoin over the counter was a spare-time "I'm stuck in the office anyway..." project.
The EPOS software we use was originally written by me in 2004 - we had a problem with stock control at one of our pubs and wanted something to book in and out every pint we sold.  I had a look around the EPOS market at the time, couldn't find anything suitable at a price that wasn't hideous, so spent a month of evenings writing my own.  We've been using it ever since!  It's written in Python and runs on Ubuntu (originally Debian) in text mode.

Heh.  Yes, it's home-brewed.  I wrote it in 2004 because I needed something that booked stock in and out again, and all the commercial offerings I could find looked poor and horribly expensive.  It's not open-sourced yet, mostly because I'm not completely happy with it - things like the per-pub configuration files and the food ordering menu are actually Python modules so managing an installation requires a certain level of knowledge!
I'm gradually re-writing it with the intention of making it open-source; I mostly need to make it more maintainable.

My original plan for converting Bitcoins accepted by the pubs back to Sterling was to go via OKpay.  When I set up an account there, they were charging 6% to convert Bitcoin to GBP and then a further 1% on GBP withdrawals to a UK bank account.
Now they don't appear to be offering Bitcoin to GBP at all (at least, the option to do so has disappeared from my account).  I'm looking for other routes (I'm waiting to hear back from [bitpay]( for example).  If I find one that's less expensive, I will reduce the "tax"; I don't need to make a huge amount from offering this service but I don't want to make a loss either.
