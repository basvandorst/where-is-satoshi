"current price of bitcoin has future growth expectations built into it"
Really? So you think BTC has the future growth of the next 20 years already priced into it... I find that hard to believe.
They say the currency markets and the stock markets have the growth of the next 6 months priced in.. and thats pushing it..
Your assumption is false.

Look at the reddit bitcoin homepage.. 
What do you see?
I call it "Bitcoin propaganda" 
Its always filled with "Business X now excepts BTC" 
Or news articles that talk about BTC, Or reasons for why BTC will go up in value.
Like I said, the main thing that determines my position is the trend on the 4hr chart, daily, and weekly chart. Then fundamentals. Fundamental are never first because human emotion can ignore fundamentals for a good while.

and bitcoin 2.0 is the solution because the supply of BTC 2.0 wont be limited to 21million, so it will adjust for the worlds demand, creating inflation. Think of all the other currencies in the world, and why they are inflationary and not deflationary like bitcoins.

The Mississippi Bubble (1716 - 1720)
John Law, Controller General of Finances of France, created a trade monopoly on the French colonies in north america (ie Louisiana). So only the Mississippi company could trade good between Louisiana and europe. 
He then told (lied to) the public about the vast amounts of wealth in Louisiana. So the public began to buy up share of the mississippi company. People though their would be great demand for the products of Louisiana and the shares of the company would go up up up (and they would all be rich), so more and more people tried to get a hold of shares. 
One woman drove her horse and carriage around the town where Law lived, day after day, until one day she finally saw him walking in the street. She immediately ordered her driver to crash the carriage into a post near where Law was walking. Law came to the womans aid and even invite her to his home. Once there she asked to buy some stock in the company. Seeing how cleaver she was he sold her some. (She probably regretted it latter). This just an example of how popular this stock was, and what people would do just to get the opportunity to buy it!
Once it became clear there was no vast amount of wealth the companies shares crashed, people lost tons. This with the combination of Laws other doings cause france to go into economic collapse.
Bitcoins could be similar as we, "the public" are being told of the vast amount of weath bitcoins have. The "Louisiana wealth" is the supposed demand the world will have for bitcoins. And I dont have to tell you how everyone here thinks they are going to make a fortune by holding BTC til 10,000 BTC/USD. Once public finds out there is no "Louisiana wealth" ie demand, the bubble will pop.

They are price estimates that I use (and derive from the charts) to know when to exit my trades. Im pretty generous with my picks, it probably will be a lot lower than when i exit, 5-10 maybe.
I guess time will tell. Right now im looking at the charts on the daily timeframe and I see the price is going to break or test 50 either on this daily candle or the next.

Thats a very idealistic view point. 
All currencies will not go bust, they will however slowly go down in value as they have been doing for the last 100 years (see us dollar).
The only way to keep a countries economy growing is to devalue the currency slowly so that debtors can pay off their debts easier and that more money goes into circulation, so that the money in the economy doesn't dry up because of savers. This would cause deflation (see great depression).
This is why your average middle class and above person invests a portion of their money in mutual funds and the stock market. So they dont loose their wealth to inflation. 
Bitcoins could serve as an investment to hedge against inflation but it has to have equal or more appeal than the stock market. And right now its a baby. The infrastructure for it is still being developed and right now people will not put a large portion of their money into bitcoins, unless to speculate.

I go by many names, but most know me a Fundraiser. Because I know how to raise my funds.
All jokes aside, im a day trader, not of bitcoins but of actual currencies. I have been doing this for many years, and this forum brings me back to my roots, I see myself in so many of the posters. I thought the same way, made the same mistakes. 
And yes I have a stake in bitcoins, im short, targeting 30. 
Years of experience both with trading and the human psychology associated with it, makes my calls accurate. 
Of course im not god and yes I do get things wrong. But my analysis tells me there is a ~90% bitcoins will end around 30 in the next few days to 1-4 weeks. So I am taking that trade.

"Bitcoin is like a giant speculation investment game" 
Yup! 100% correct. Everyone here is hoping to become a millionaire through bitcoin.
Look at the speculative bubbles of the last 50 years. A small minority became millionaires, while the rest lost everything.

@_date: 2013-04-22 03:12:07
Well.. this is quite interesting..
They might actually get it below 30, not because of the bogus mtgox report but because this information got leaked (on accident or on purpose). 
Because people are expecting this DDOS and mass sell, a lot of people are likely going to sell their bitcoins before it starts..
And even if the majority doesnt sell, seems like no one will be foolish enough to start buying now..
well! im adding to my short position :))
The price might start going now in anticipation of the attack.

1 BTC x 135 = $135
1 BTC x 300 = $300
Loss of -$165, if it gets to $300. I have $1000 in the account now, so currently very little risk of margin call.
Once I add onto my position the risk of margin call increases, but I will use charts, look for lower lows before I get in (confirmation of bear trend start). Then sell 1 btc every 10 dollar drop or so. And i will put breakeven stops on all the btc before it, so with my strategy risk of a margin call is very low.
This is called a pyramiding strategy.

Seeing how most of the early adopters are tech geeks I would think they would be more driven to cash out, use that money to start a startup tech company and have a very happy 10-20 years pursuing their passion.
Only a small minority of them would think like you just posted. 
I hope everyone who reads this honestly asks themselves if they would wait 20 years so they could become a "Millionaire filantropist" or if they would cash out 2 M now to invest in investments that pay out 10K a month. With enough left over to buy a house, car, and even start up a tech company (which you would have full control over and could make even more that if you held in BTC).

Ok, as a REAL day trader, here is some free advice:
Every professional day trader (actually ANY trader!) has a set of rules, that they come up with (usually from experience or wisdom). If you want to be successful you CANNOT EVER break these rules.
I wont give you all my rules but here are a few:
1) NEVER EVER FUCKING EVER!!!! FUCKING NEVER!! EVER!!! "double down", fucking never! you got that? Seriously! I know your think it now, but DONT! FUCKING NEVER!
When you double down on a losing trade and it goes against you, it has the potential to completely wipe out your entire account. BUT when the trade goes in your favor THEN you can add onto your position. 
Only add onto winning trades, never losing trades.
2) Enter every trade with a price target. A target that you will take profits at and a target that you will take loses at. STICK TO YOUR TARGETS!! FUCKING DO IT! I know you wont, and it will cost you. Say you got in at 100 and your "loss" target is 80. The price will get to 80 and you wont get out because you just cant take the pain of closing your position for a loss. So you say to yourself, "ahh I can wait it out, it will get back to a 100, i know it". WRONG! This may work a few times, but eventually YOU WILL GET BURNED! Because one day it will crash down to 20 and you will have lost your entire trading account. 
It is better to take a loss, and live to trade another day.
3) Do not flight the trend! "I fought the trend and the trend won" &lt;-- little song I sing every time I think of doing it.
Look at the chart, we are currently in a bear trend. My rule is NEVER, NEVER EVER EVER! place a trade that goes against the current trend! NEVER!. 
Those 3 rules are specific to your post because they outline 3 mistakes you and every other amateur trader just made. 
Those 3 rules cost me thousands of dollars to learn, back when I first started day trading. In total all the lessons and rules ive learned have cost me tens of thousands of dollars.
I wont be giving you any more rules, but I will leave you with this piece of advice. After every bad trade you make, take sometime to analyze it and pull some lessons/rules of it. This way, the money you loss wont be lost for nothing.
Disclosure: Im short from 100, 1st target: 40, 2nd target: 30, 3rd target 25.

its because you think bitcoin is more popular than it really is. If all you do is read the r/bitcoin homepage, then yes you will get that impression. Everyday you see a few new shops accepting it or an article promoting it and you think "OMG this is getting big".
But in reality it is not. I live in chicago and i have yet to see ANYTHING related to bitcoins.

It just doesnt work, especially in the long run.
And if you guys all keep buying into the bitcoin 1.0 scam it will only hurt a future crypto currency like btc 2.0, when it comes out, because the public will remember btc 1.0 and think.. o no not this scam again.

Yup that a great strategy (in a developed market) and I have looked into it but the financial tools in place for doing such a trade are not great. 
The only exchange that offers futures is "ICBIT". It is run by someone anonymous, so theres risk in putting money in it. Plus the future is only good until the other person who you bought the future from gets a margin call. So if the BTC crashes from 100 to 50 in one day and the person you bought the future doesnt have the money in his account to cover that lose he will get a margin call and you may only get some fraction of what you thought you would get. Basically your hedge goes to shit. 
The financial tools for hedging bitcoins are shit at best, that is why I dont think you can safely hedge bitcoins right now. 
And tools for actually short selling bitcoins are nonexistant. (A bunch of site claim to be almost there, but none have done it thus far). 
^^ if im wrong about what I said about bitcoin derivatives someone please correct me.

If you are for real, then here is some good advice:
Sell half. You are "millionaire" but only at the current price. Personally I think bitcoin will fall to ~20 in the next 1-3 weeks. 
If this happens then you're not a millionaire anymore.
So sell half, that way if bitcoin ever makes it big you will still make it big, and if it crashes, well at least you will have cashed out a million dollars before it did.
I imagine you are young, so let me open you mind: Invested well, a million dollar can maintain a very good standard of living for you for the rest of your life.
Right now is the perfect time to buy some rental properties.
Imagine buying a few houses around the campus of a big ten school.
Lets say one really big house 3 floors = $230,000
Say you buy 2. 
So lets say half a million spent on buying and doing some renovations on 2 houses that each have 3 floors. (Say they can hold 6 ppl a house)
Avg student pays on housing ~400 per month x 12 (number of students in your houses) = 4,800 a month.
4800 x 12 (months) = $57,600
^ that a very good salary here in the us.
Dont be stupid, if you dont cash out half and invest in safer things you are gambling! Period!
The people here that will tell you to hold on, but they wont tell you one thing. The reason they want you to hold on! They want you to hold because they dont want you to sell! because if you sell you will drive the price lower and they will lose money, because most of the people here are heavily invested in bitcoins.
RIGHT this second we had a huge run up in value for bitcoins, from 50 to 90. This is will not last, we are in a bear market and this was the final leg up before a huge crash that will bring us to 20-30. 
TRUST me! Be smart! cash out half! 
Do not gamble with this.

Im not telling him to gamble, actually quite opposite. OP stated he wants to keep trading and recover funds. I gave him the least risk route (why/how?):
If he takes my advice:
1) He is not betting against the trend
2) He will only add onto his short position as the trade goes into his favor.
So say he only goes short 1-3% of his entire account first, then as the price goes down he adds another 1-3%, then more and more as the price goes lower, leaving room for retraces (so he doesnt get a margin call). Even better as the trade goes lower he can moves individual stops to break even, to minimize risk in case of a reversal. 
3) He is not trying to time the market (like you do with all your little trades).
Seems a lot less riskier than the strategy you employ. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:02:33
Look at the 4hr charts...
What do you see?
Lower lows and lower highs.. (means bear trend)
The bulls are not back, they are just stopping through. 
The post below me is correct, when 85 is breached (and it will be, very soon) then the price is going back to test 50 again, this time it WILL breach 50 heading to 20-30.
Sorry kiddies.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:34:20
30's my target, but I imagine it going lower, maybe to 15 where all of this began. 
The numbers I get from looking at the chart, the reason why I see it falling there is because the entire backbone of bitcoin is based on speculators and not actually users.
So the lower we go the more selling we will encounter, as the early adopters and speculators cash out. 
Logically does it make sense to hold bitcoins if you were an early adopter and currently have 20,000 BTC? 
No. Here's why:
Your net worth is currently around say ~2,000,000 USD. If you hold that in BTC you are gambling. When it comes to that large of an amount of money, not only are you gambling with your life/future but with that of your childrens, your grandchildrens, your great grandchildrens.
The logical investment move:
-Sell 3/4 of your BTC: so you have 1.5 M and 5000 BTC
Now if BTC is really going to take off, then ITS REALLY GOING TO TAKE OFF, right? Like the people on here say, BTC could be worth 1000, 2000, 10,000? 
So if BTCs end up being worth 10K a pop 10 years from now you still stand to make:
-5000 BTC x 10,000USD = 50,000,000.
If you held the entire 20K BTC you would have made 200 million. But what can you buy with 200 M than you cant buy with 50 M.
Catch my drift..
Now! you use that 1.5 M to buy real estate that you can rent. In and around Chicago you can buy condos for 100K or a house for 200K. 
Rental prices are as follows:
2 Bedroom condo - $900/$1200 a month
Single family home - $2000 a month
So say you buy 1 M worth of condo's. Thats 10 condos.
10 condos x $1000 (a month) = $10,000 (A MONTH!)
10,000 a month x 12 years = $120,000 a year!
Do you have any idea how well you can live on 120K a year?!? 
The condos you rent out also protect you against inflation as you can adjust the rent when need be. 
In Summary:
You now own 10 condos which make you 120K a year
You have 500K to do with as you please (buy your own really nice house and mercedes)
You have 5,000 BTC that may or may not be worth a lot in the distant future.
Now put yourself in someones shoes who has 20K BTC. Would you REALLY not do what I just wrote?
Not to mention: Time is money, if you cash out now you can start living the good life, not have to wait 10-20 years (or forever) for the price of BTC to recover.
Thats just what any logically person would do, and what anyone with any REAL money in BTC will do soon of they haven't already.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:39:52
I have thought about BTC some more, here is my new analysis:
If everything goes as planned then yes. But what everyone here assumes is that bitcoins will be as useful as you all think they will be. That is probably where most of my doubt comes from. The usefulness I can see right now is: illegal online businesses, and money laundering. 
Someone mentioned that bitcoins will be huge for international money transfers because there are no fees. But you can send money to anyone with the same bank as you for free, international or domestic, does not matter. This seems a lot easier than having to buy BTCs (pay 1-2% fee ), transfer the bitcoins, then the recipient turns the BTC into domestic currency (another fee) so he can pay rent (because his middle aged landlord doesnt know how to use bitcoins). The average person doesn't do much international business, or send much money internationally anyway. 
Now that I think about it, I see one reason why BTCs might be increasing as much as they are right now.. Since governments are beginning to regulate exchanges the window for money laundering is closing fast. A lot of drug, under-the-table, and hidden untaxed, money may be flowing through the bitcoin exchanges right now. I would love to hear opinions about this.
So once the money laundering window is closed that could be a blow for bitcoins. 
The volatile exchange rate, will scare off businesses because the owners will have to immediately sell off any coins they get paid in to avoid risking loses. The only businesses that tolerate this are the illegal ones like silkroad, they have no alternative.
To accept online payments with no fees (well .25$ but thats nothing) one could use dwolla, safer, not volatile, and easier to use. 
And so we get to supply and demand. The supply here is limited (as everyone pointed out multiple times), we all know that. So all we have to worry about is demand. But the demand is not as high, and perhaps will not be as great as you all hope. 
Demand to use BTC for money tranfers: small
Demand to use BTC for legal purchases: small
Demand to use BTC for storage of wealth: small
Demand to use BTC for illegal purchases: high
Demand to use BTC for money laundering: unknown (but only temporary) 
Demand to use BTC for speculation: very high
I feel for all of these posters libertarian view points. But they just wont materialize. Yes you are all sick of the financial system, of banks and credit card companies, etc, etc.. You all think the rest of the public feels the same and they will jump onto bitcoins. But they dont feel the same way. They love banks and credit cards. They love the easy credit. Average american credit card debt is at 10K per person. Bitcoins will not take over the current financial system, they will not make some global currency that is excepted everywhere around the world. They will not be used to store wealth when there are better, safer, and less riskier investments. Examples: Stocks, metals, bonds, treasuries, real estate, safe heaven currencies, mutual funds, investment banks, etc. 
Please add onto my demand side of the equation with an explanation for why this demand will exist and why at the level you specify.
Thank you!

First world problems: having 1500 in "shit and giggle money"
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:33:50
But see the thing about buying a stock is that you are buying a share in a company. If I buy apple stock that means I own a % of Apple. Which means I have a share in its buildings, its products, all other assets. When apple does good and makes great products it makes money and the company gains wealth which is in turn expressed in its share price. 
Some companies have dividends where they will actually pay shareholders a % of the profits they made. 
What is "real value" does bitcoin have? Its not a company, it makes no products.
The only value it has is what it claims to be, ie a currency. It is a tool used to facilitate trade. Its value is in how useful it is do it job of facilitating trade and how many people use it.

Yup, im fairly new to bitcoins and you have brought up some good points. Since you seem to know a lot about BTC and believe they will work, ill direct this question at you, but I would love to hear everyone's opinion.
What do you think about Litecoins? If the bitcoin network and infrastructure expands and develops to what a lot of people on here think it will, wouldnt it be super simple to integrate another cryptocurrency into that infrastructure like Litecoins? And I image exchanges and business would love to do that as it means more exchange fees, etc. 
So to all the speculators out their, why not speculate in Litecoins? Seems they are way undervalued right now, if you truly believe in the crypocurrency potential, then I imagine they will skyrocket too. Seems like you could buy 20,000 LTC @ ~10K USD and if all goes the way of the BTC cash out at 25LTC/USD, just for example. And boom! Your half way to being a millionaire.. 
So whats the deal with litecoins..

@_date: 2013-03-29 00:53:56
I got a 300% return on my investment, in 2 months time, that is marvelous! 
That kind of thinking, "Oh, I messed up, why did I cash out so soon" is a bad type of thinking to have. Because next time you will be afraid to cash out at a good price because you will be thinking about the profits you can have and not the ones you do have.
Fear and greedy are the 2 most prominent emotions in trading and they are the ones that cost people the most money.

Bitcoins a pump and dump.
Bitcoin creates value out of thin air. 
Speculators in bitcoin are delusional.
Bitcoin holders all claim they are in it for the decentralized, anonymous, world wide currency benefits, but when you suggest to make a new currency which has all the same benefits but remains at a fixed price, they all say, What! why would I buy into a currency that doesn't appreciate in the long run. 
Obviously they want to get rich off late investors..
Most recent thing I read on here is that they want a small country to start using bitcoins as their currency, yeah right!
bitcoins are deflationary by nature and no country would be stupid enough to make bitcoins their currency, it would be economic suicide. 
And once the early adopters start to realize that bitcoin is economically flawed they will dump. I image a lot of them are using bitcoins to buy gold and silver. Its no coincidence that the most money from bitcoin based sales are of metal. People that bought in early are diversifying out.
I believe we are heading into round 2 of the "dump".

Most successful traders have a strategy that they have developed over several years of trading. It incorporates all the mistakes they have made (that every new trader makes).
And as a person who makes a lot of money from this, I can tell you I have never ever thought about selling it.
So honestly.. any successful trader wouldnt be interested, unless you pay VERY well. And I doubt that...

Yes exactly! And also I would never try add more shorts if the trade went against me, ie) say it goes to 150 now, I would never add onto a losing trade, thats called pyramiding in the wrong direction lol.
Right now the price fell to 125 so I sold another bitcoin because the trades going in my favor. 
I also put a "stop" on the 1 bitcoin i sold at 135. So if the price goes to 135 I get out of the trade (1 sold bitcoin @ 135) for no loss (ie breakeven). Ill still have the 1 bitcoin I sold at 125 but thats ok because I know I wont get a margin call and im not pyramiding in the wrong direction. ie) i wont sell anymore bitcoins until the price gets below 125.

@_date: 2013-04-17 15:15:22
and if you just want to be told what to do to make your money back then do this:
Open an acct at bitfinex.com, with bitfinex you can short the market (ie people will loan you bitcoins, you sell them at market, then buy them back  at a lower price and return them to the borrower) you keep the profit you made.
They let you trade on margin so you will make your money back faster (if you do what i say).
Sell 1 bitcoin now, then another at 85
then at 1 @ 82.5
then at 1 @ 80
then at 1 @ 75
then at 1 @ 70
then at 1 @ 65
then at 1 @ 60
then at 1 @ 55
then at 1 @ 50
then at 1 @ 45
then at 1 @ 40
then at 1 @ 35
You might not have enough money to sell 1 entire bitcoin, but thats not the point, the point is to sell a small amount as the trade goes in your favor and pyramid your profits. 
Also when you are selling you must make room for 30-40 price swings in bitcoin. If you dont, and price swings high up like it did this morning you can get a margin call and wipe your entire acct.
Target 30 BTC/USD, when it reachs that price cash out, you will have all your money back a little extra.
Follow these rules to a tee. ^^ Just place the trades and dont think about them.
Ive told you exactly what you need to do make back your loses, but see how this is your first rodeo I would bet that you will not follow it exact and lose. 80% chance..
Sorry that how it goes. I can tell a person where the price will be with 90% accuracy and they will still lose money because they dont know the psychology  of the game. 
Dont feel to bad, think of the money you lost, not as lost, but paid for like a tuition. You gain knowledge and experience. And next time when your older and have a serious amount of money you wont be foolish enough to do what you did again (at least I hope).
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:07:56
they dont have to eliminate it. All they have to do is make it illegal for businesses to accept it as a form of payment. And shut down all the exchanges.
Once that happens all the speculator on here who think bitcoin is the next big thing will abandon ship, crashing the price and destroying bitcoins forever. 
BOOM! and your finished!
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:54:35
btw, here is some advice, look at the daily chart to determine the trend. I see a downward trend. So I will not place a long position, ever! Not until I see a new trend. 
If you short and the price goes against you, chances are it will come back, because we are in a downward trend. If you go long and the 
price goes against you, chances are it wont come back.  
just food for thought.

What about right now, would you advise people to buy BTC today at $90 and hold for the long term? What price do you see this thing going to? Whats your target?
Whenever I enter a trade I have price target. My long term target on this was $100, but once it started growing fast I made a short term target of $50. It reached 50 and I cashed out. No worries no regrets. Its when I break my own rules is when I lose money.

The price of gold is stable because the demand for gold is stable. If tomorrow gold was announced as the new world currency, demand for gold would increase exponentially while supply would remain where its at. This would cause the price to increase drastically. 
If bitcoin is to be a new world currency used by all, demand will just continue to grow, meaning its price will only continue to increase. 
This will cause people to save bitcoins instead of spend, leading to deflation.

"The end of the bank saw a period of runaway inflation, until Jackson's executive order requiring all federal land payments be made in gold or silver, driving all banks to require payments in gold and silver, producing the depression of 1837, which lasted for four years."
Our founding fathers had disputes against a central bank. Some saw its necessity, others (like a lot of you here on this reddit) thought it was "evil".
A central bank is necessary to adjust levels of currency to prevent deflation and too much inflation. Read up on the financial history of the US, start here:
The top GDP countries in world have all adopted a central bank type financial system. There is a reason for that.

Ok for starters this guy has been a loony for a long time now. 
Second, do you guys understand now why BTC 1.0 is going to fail?
The bitcoin system right now is deflationary and purely speculative. Prices will keep fluctuating and keep going up, as people use it as a high risk speculative investment and not a currency. 
Not to mention regulators will shut down all exchange bank accounts. 
I really think you guys need to consider making Bitcoin 2.0.
It will be exactly the same as 1.0 but it will either be pegged to the dollar or gold or not have a limited supply. ie) the supply will increase with demand, keeping prices the same.
Right now all of you are just using BTC 1.0 to get rich quick. Sorry but this system is a ponzi scheme pump &amp; dump by design.
If you really want a decentralized online accepted anywhere in the world with no fees currency think about BTC 2.0.

Reposting this reply, because the reply in which its being posted is downvoted. This is something I think all of you should read:
30's my target, but I imagine it going lower, maybe to 15 where all of this began.
The numbers I get from looking at the chart, the reason why I see it falling there is because the entire backbone of bitcoin is based on speculators and not actually users.
So the lower we go the more selling we will encounter, as the early adopters and speculators cash out.
Logically does it make sense to hold bitcoins if you were an early adopter and currently have 20,000 BTC?
No. Here's why:
Your net worth is currently around say ~2,000,000 USD. If you hold that in BTC you are gambling. When it comes to that large of an amount of money, not only are you gambling with your life/future but with that of your childrens, your grandchildrens, your great grandchildrens.
The logical investment move: -Sell 3/4 of your BTC: so you have 1.5 M and 5000 BTC
Now if BTC is really going to take off, then ITS REALLY GOING TO TAKE OFF, right? Like the people on here say, BTC could be worth 1000, 2000, 10,000?
So if BTCs end up being worth 10K a pop 10 years from now you still stand to make: -5000 BTC x 10,000USD = 50,000,000.
If you held the entire 20K BTC you would have made 200 million. But what can you buy with 200 M than you cant buy with 50 M.
Catch my drift..
Now! you use that 1.5 M to buy real estate that you can rent. In and around Chicago you can buy condos for 100K or a house for 200K.
Rental prices are as follows:
2 Bedroom condo - $900/$1200 a month Single family home - $2000 a month
So say you buy 1 M worth of condo's. Thats 10 condos.
10 condos x $1000 (a month) = $10,000 (A MONTH!)
10,000 a month x 12 years = $120,000 a year!
Do you have any idea how well you can live on 120K a year?!?
The condos you rent out also protect you against inflation as you can adjust the rent when need be.
In Summary:
You now own 10 condos which make you 120K a year
You have 500K to do with as you please (buy your own really nice house and mercedes)
You have 5,000 BTC that may or may not be worth a lot in the distant future.
Now put yourself in someones shoes who has 20K BTC. Would you REALLY not do what I just wrote?
Not to mention: Time is money, if you cash out now you can start living the good life, not have to wait 10-20 years (or forever) for the price of BTC to recover.
Thats just what any logically person would do, and what anyone with any REAL money in BTC will do soon of they haven't already.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:56:16

I keep reading the posts on this Reddit, most are very emotional. Everyone is happy because their bitcoins are worth so much, or sad/angry because they didnt buy in sooner.
1-2 months from now everyone will be depressed when this thing crashes.. 
People have told me that this dramatic rise is great for bitcoin because it gets people interested and this will cause more people to get involved.. Well we have developed a bubble and when the crash comes it will destroy most of the credibility in bitcoins. And the people will realize that all these posts on the front page claiming bitcoins are god, are just bitcoin propaganda used to lure in suckers and jack the price up..
Anyway, I warned all you "followers" in my previous posts..

Cant wait for all the speculators to start selling!

You are not betting that the price of the properties will grow. You are not going to sell those properties, you will pass them down to your kids, they to their kids, and so on and so forth. The point is to live off the rent.
And your family will never go broke.
Is this your first rodeo?

And that is exactly the problem! By excepting an inflationary currency you do whats good for yourself and the country. &lt;-- this will lead to a growing economy and eventually more customers and more profits.
By excepting bitcoins you are only doing whats good for yourself. &lt;-- this in the long run will lead to economic stagnation and depression, resulting in less customers and less profit.

ahhh.. "Fees are taken for holding coins and distributed to miners." I dont like that..
Guess im just going to have to create my own currency ;)  One with an automatic central bank algorithm (or something) that can control the currency supply as need.

I agree the bitcoin may find its value in gambling, but this exponential growth experienced in the past 3 months is because of speculators and not because of the possible value it has in gambling.

I keep reading the posts on this Reddit, most are very emotional. Everyone is happy because their bitcoins are worth so much, or sad/angry because they didnt buy in sooner.
1-2 months from now everyone will be depressed when this thing crashes..
People have told me that this dramatic rise is great for bitcoin because it gets people interested and this will cause more people to get involved.. Well we have developed a bubble and when the crash comes it will destroy most of the credibility in bitcoins. And the people will realize that all these posts on the front page claiming bitcoins are god, are just bitcoin propaganda used to lure in suckers and jack the price up..
Anyway, I warned all you "followers" in my previous posts..
What scares me is how sure you all are that bitcoins are going to be huge.. Im sure theres a good portion of you out there that have put more into this thing than you are prepared to lose.
None so blind as those that are sure they see..

" If the increase in demand is known and expected, like is is with bitcoin,"
so what is the known and expected demand of bitcoin then? If you know it...
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:49:30
The supply of Bitcoins will be decreased by the people. 
If you, like some people on here, expect Bitcoins to be HUGE, I mean used by a lot of people all around the world then you cant compare the demand for gold to the demand for bitcoins.

also when I first read your post I thought you said " We need to have a watcher circlejerk" LOL &gt;:D
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:03:36
shhhh your gonna jinx it!
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:09:35
Ok guys! Thanks for this discussion, I feel i learned a thing or two from you, hope you learned a little from me. 
As for the price of bitcoins, only time will tell.
Have a great night!

Really? If you look at my other posts its 95% seeing it going to 1000 by the end of april and only 5% seeing a crash...
seems like everyone here is now suffering from hindsight bias..
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:15:41
using your assumption growth would be slow and steady over 10 years, not exponential over 3 months.
Thats why I agree bitcoin could be worth a good amount someday, but it is not worth what it is priced at today. 
Thats why I am hoping the people here with dollar signs in their eyes be careful and take a few steps back. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:59:06
funny thing is sites that let you short bitcoins on margin, like bitfinex, are running smoothly. hahaha
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:29:25
im short, dont worry, im going to cash in on the ride down..
Im just saying, after all is said and done, we will need to consider an inflationary currency if we ever want a crypto to be taken seriously.
