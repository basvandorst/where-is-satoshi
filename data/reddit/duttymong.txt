Based on all of [these]( factors, people are theorising that the knock on effect of the all the media coverage we've been seeing could cause a large price increase over the coming weeks. It takes time to verify at the exchange and for bank transfers so next week could see a lot of new buyers. 
Just a theory obviously, you can't predict the weather after all.

afaik They were based in Slovenia and Slovenia doesn't have the best economy right now so they were proactive and moved to the UK. However, in the UK no banks wanted to work with them so they had to keep this split.

I bought bitcoin 3 weeks ago, pleased that the small amount I invested has already eclipsed the annual interest I receive on my other savings accounts (1.8% 0.o)
I use an online wallet primarily, I use this because I travel a lot so therefore want to be able to access my funds should I need them on the go.

@_date: 2013-10-21 17:23:57
I have some of my savings in a tax-free cash ISA at 1.8% (basically nothing). Is it worth taking say 5% and investing in bitcoin as a high risk/high return investment?  And if so, is now the right time to buy or should I hold back buying in case of a bubble pop?
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:55:27
I think so. For example if Bitcoin ever went to $10000 it would be worth $600. Although there is no guarantee, compared to tiny bank interest rates today, its worth the punt/risk.

That money will work more for you in Bitcoin than it will in any bank account available right now. You could cash in and buy an iphone, but imagine in 5 years if BTC is 10k a coin how gutted you'd feel and how worthless that iphone (or whatever) you bought is.
As you bought so low you have nothing to 'lose' even if bitcoin dropped to 0 tomorrow.

Hmm I guess. The more I think of it the more it confuses me. Someone suggested the idea for prostitutes a while ago and there was a logical reason I forget. I think it's so you can manage a *completely offline* wallet, you could give it to employees for example, from Armory's description:
*Watching-only wallets:  "Watching-only" wallets can be used generate addresses and confirm incoming payments, but cannot spend the money.  Keep the full wallet on an offline computer, and maintain it safely from the online computer.  Or create a master wallet for your business, and give a watching-only copy to your employees to do business.  It's impossible for a hacker (or employee) to steal your Bitcoins if your private keys are on a computer that never touched the internet!*

The opponent was not very well informed, which is pretty typical of most people who try to argue against Bitcoin. They don't know it enough to form strong arguments, especially against Max Keiser.

edit: Like the others are saying keep a small position, especially as you believe in BTC for the future. You may be able to put a deposit down on a house with in a year or cover the next big financial debt.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:15:44
Its more profitable to play the bad guy imo. Website hits, twitter followers, advertising etc means he's getting paid either way. 
If BTC succeeds it doesn't really matter to him because he just won't acknowledge it. He'll move on to the next thing and write sensational articles about that too. If it fails he'll gloat and say how he told us so until his fingers fall off. Its win/win.
Those who can, do. Those who can't, become critics. It's better to try your best and fail than criticise and never try.

If you want to get a bit fancy; as well as printing your QR code you can use Armory to create a version of your wallet which has no private keys that you can keep on your phones Bitcoin app, this way you can check your balance when transactions go through and because the Wallet doesn't have the private keys, if you lose your phone then no one can spend your coins.
I think Armory is the only way to do this, not sure though. Maybe someone else knows.

Many people will have read about it but not many will truly understand the what it is and how it could benefit them, let alone figure out how to buy and store them! (Think internet confusion circa. 1994)
The truth is the majority are not ready for Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not yet ready for the majority! All technology has an adoption process. People didn't start using Facebook over night, even though they may have read about it. It took years to get to the point where everybody's gran has one! 
If you look at a [technology adoption chart]( don't think we're even in the 'early adopters' stage yet, maybe very soon now mainstream businesses are getting involved.
In time and when the infrastructure is in place (ATM's, retail stores, management systems that are idiot proof) the 'early majority' of people will begin to use it, presuming it succeeds at all of course!
