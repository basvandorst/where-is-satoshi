Ohhhhh yeah like when bch attempts to do hostile takeovers of btc. Ok shill
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:59:42
And? The only people I know who value forks are just shills. Btc will remain king for a while until eth progresses

Sounds like a real catch. I'm glad my gf doesn't belittle me and actually cares about what I have to say.
Without me asking her, she asked me to put all her savings in btc because "if I believe in it then it's  gotta be worth something". Maybe when you hit big you can get a divorce before you cash out

advice on where to start for that? even $100/day doesn't sound bad, especially if i'm putting that into btc
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:34:28
I read it and I understand?

She's a bartender with no real savings potential. She had ~$250 USD  sitting in a jar and has since added another $100 to btc once she saw her 250 go to 290 in a week. She knows that a crash can happen. She knows that money can just go poof but I honestly don't think btc is going to ever be at 3k again so even if she breaks even she's happy because it's still money. 
I have a bot setup that will sell her coins at her buy in price. I'm just hodling and hoping I can turn my .2 btc into 1 whole btc at some point. I just want to go back to school and stop slaving away all day. Btc is the new American ^tm dream

Why did you replace a 7 year old server with only a 10% performance gain? That's literally a waste of money. 
Fwiw, I went from playing a game at 30fps to playing a game at 144+fps over the last 4 years so I'm not sure what you're getting at with this 10% shit

Do we though? Look st the downvotes he got. I feel like we do a pretty good job shutting down any sexists that try to vocalize.

Holy hell, what shit people. “Petition to force these companies into being more diverse” lmaoooo. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:22:57
No. We really need less people like you in crypto. This isn’t something that we need to give an artificial gender quota to fill to make sure we have enough of each minority. 
If people want to get into crypto, they will get into crypto. No one is gatekeeping. No one is stopping them. They’re just not interested.

Wow, how predictable. You can talk down to a man about his dick size, but if someone issues the same vulgarity to you, it’s a problem. Maybe figure out that you have double standards and should work on that.
