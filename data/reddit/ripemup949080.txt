Answer my question have you even used bitcoin before? Do you know who created it. Dont say satoshi either there are other players who helped develop it in its early days.

Same could be said for USD..., the fundamental value for BTC is the bitcoin network. AKA, the thousands of individuals or groups around the globe that do either a combination of running the BTC network nodes or mining, or a combination of both. Also certain companies like lightning network where the create on-ramps or payment processes to make BTC more accessible to people and try to create a better understanding for BTC.  You are reflecting on the price which is not the long term fundamental value (intrinsic value). You could apply the same talking points to stocks as well. Akin to today, why did the company blue apron rise 50% today just because they added beyond meat to some of their menus or catalog? Disclosure I am long btc, but when I mean long I mean at least to 2025. Looking at the price is a very short sighted way of viewing this. Now, I could be right on my long term call or I could very well be wrong and I will lose money. Reasoning for the drop in price is bc of the senate banking hearing today and Mnuchin + Trump's words about the cryptocurrency space yesterday creating a lot of FUD. There really is no **fundamental** reasoning for price drop.  I am a little concerned about this, however I will only be flatly scared if we chose to go down the path like India and outright ban crypto, but this is unlikely.  However, BTC does experience 40% drops in bull markets and we have experienced this before. So again talk to me in 2025 and you can say I told you so or I can say the same thing to you. I would like to understand your viewpoint on the fundamental value of crypto. And what I mean by that is, payment networks (aka vendors or people accepting btc) which is growing. Companies backing btc and even Jack from twitter using cash app to help promote btc awareness and lightning network to help build the layers on btc network. HODL.

Honest to god question though, do you think bitcoin can make it to 100k within like say the next 40 years
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:54:13
So you do not receive awards like miners do completing blocks? Do you receive a fee for validating transactions with a node?
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:59:47
\*when bitcoin passes gold's market capitalization.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:13:45
6% interest fee is variable remember that. I was about to do the same thing but found out that the 6% fee is not fixed. Look at Ari Paul's twitter he explains alot about this. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:40:14
What's your interest rate and loan term? That makes a huge difference.

How do you run your own node? I've heard of casa node but I'm not entirely sure what a node does? Plz Help.

Not selling any of my BTC till it reaches over a trillion $$ market cap
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:45:36
how much bitcoin do you pay to fill that up?
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:14:36
Also your bitcoin will be locked for a while, you cannot withdraw it like a regular bank account. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:49:24
seems to be working fine with me just checked
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:10:51
So... if I had my own node I know that my incoming transaction is true compared to a third party where I basically have to take them by their word? I still don't really see the significance of owning my own node. Could you elaborate more on this?
@_date: 2019-03-22 16:55:38

@_date: 2019-03-04 21:23:40
Can someone explain to me what the usefulness of casanode is? how does it differ to mining? All I am aware is that a node helps strengthen the network? Can someone expand on this??

I know that its a wallet. I have a ledger. I just want to experiment sending/receiving bitcoin kinda like what venmo does 
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:21:29
So what is the purpose of owning a full node then?

Wouldn't this cause a run of banks? I know if I was getting losing money in my savings account I would just go withdraw it and put it into store of value assets.

@_date: 2019-03-08 16:38:54
I know but what if there's the situation where I want to take a small amount of bitcoin idk lets say $25 and maybe send it to some via mobile. i use my ledger to store bigger amounts
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:16:30
Okay thanks for the clarity. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:46:40
Okay so what would be the whole point of owning a full node then if I could just store my funds on a hardware wallet and just run transaction's off of Ledger's Node? Would the point of owning my own node just to know that my transactions a absolute to the (bitcoin) network? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:43:29
is this legit I was literally just looking at the home page for this lol
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:58:26
He forgot the part were large amounts of gold inventory are stored by Central Banks. They hold the largest share of the world's gold. The central bank sector holds like 33000 tonnes of gold. The U.S. alone holds more gold than like Germany, France, and Italy. And those 4 countries are your top 4 in the top 10. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:14:30
One has 21 million units like 4 million  or so are lost =17 million units only in the world. There are way more units of gold than that in the  world. In a sheer numbers sense bitcoin is more rare.
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:35:36
Okay that sort of makes sense... but how do I know/ execute my transaction through my node? Like for example if I had my own node and I had BTC from an exchange and I wanted to send this BTC from my exchange to my wallet. Is there a address on my node that I send it to from the exchange? Apologies for all the questions just trying to grasp the concept.
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:41:01
There is a flaw in what your saying though if bitcoin appreciates like you say it will (ie bitcoin greater than 1 mil) why would the holders of the 8 million mined bitcoins sell them for the a depreciated dollar? What if the financial system moved away from the dollar/ the world adopted bitcoin or another crypto as the reserve currency. Your whole theory evolves around the USD being the reserve currency, while this is true in the short term. Long term it is likely that USD won't be the world's reserve currency.

Is this/Are you... Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:08:10
So if I wanted ultimate security and anonymity I could in theory have keys on a hardware wallet, then move those keys to a full node address that I own and then to another address on the network if I was sending some funds to another address? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:37:33
Okay but what if there was a scenario where ledger/trezor's servers become compromised? What would happen to the private keys?  
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:05:30
How do they know who to send the questionnaires to? Is it looked up through data from exchanges?
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:02:38
buy crypto with mastercard/fiat, buy ledger/trezor wallet with mastercard, transfer bought crypto from exchange you bought crypto to ledger/trezor wallet and boom, you now have funds you spent on crypto with your mastercard on you cold storage wallet
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:59:57
I don't think you can do that I've never heard of spending crypto through a mastercard maybe I don't understand your problem?
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:31:41

Do you need an account minimum for GDAXX/coinbase. pro? Either way, coinbase is still purchasing bitcoin from another exchange and marking up a premium to the purchaser to buy bitcoin. I would like to eliminate the middleman (aka coinbase). And find the source(the other exchange) and buy bitcoin directly there. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:28:29
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:26:32
Bitcoin is also going to be or already is way more rare than gold. They're similar but not really comparable since mankind has never experienced an asset class like cryptos.
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:28:07

Algorithmic Trading.Using computer code to execute buy and sell orders. It's high frequency quantitative trading. Happens alot in the stock market. Most trading nowadays is done with high frequency trading. Lots of Financial Institutions and hedge fund/private equity do it. If you believe in the future of the crypto space just hodl. This is a long game not a short one. Just don't look at the price right now. That's what I'm doing, I've hodl through the bear market, I can hodl some more no big deal. In my opinion I think its financial institutions and big players that trying to shake out the weak hands right now. Give it through the summertime.

It's zerohedge but there's been correlation when the SP500 drops/risk-on assets drop, bitcoin drops. I think it's interesting bc a little while ago this relationship used to be a negative correlation not a positive one. But I'm hodling for the long term, think 2025 not 2019.  [

I understand and agree with you. The only way for someone like you or me to combat this is to just hodl and not compete with these bots. It is an unwinnable trade unless you have the capital to match the capital behind these trading bots. The people behind these trading bots are ones with massive capital, they want to shake out the market first so they can own it later in the future. Again this is a long term bull run but it will take a long ass time so it would be better to not focus on price for the time being.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:56:33
Held of 200 day moving average for 3 days= new bull run but there will be pull backs 2-3 years time we'll be back in the mania phase. Right now it is like 2014-15 again.

Bitcoin is the market leader, so usually what happens is whatever bitcoin does other crypto markets follow. If I were you some fundamental things to look up would be like the interest in Bitcoin like you can google how many times bitcoin was googled in the past month, how many bitcoin transactions have there been, is it increasing/decreasing? Are nodes increasing/decreasing? Has there been any large purchases of bitcoin? Trading volume? (although that can be unreliable). These are the type of questions you need to ask yourself if your looking at bitcoin as an investment and you need to understand the tech behind bitcoin as well.

This will never happen nopec was first established 20 years ago and nothing has happened then. If we leave the saudis, they're fucked too it's the same relationship as the chinese.

We're gonna get a shake down to remove weak hands when we hit 6000 major resistance, probably going to 3500-5000k through summer then test backup to 6k in fall and break it in late 2019 then ramp up in early 2020.
