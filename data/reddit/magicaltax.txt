I imagine the same happend with silver coins in clay pots 2,000 years ago, the instructions weren't understood, or not communicated.  Hence, the buried pots of treasure still being discovered to this day.

Mark Karpeles already has them...  
does that mean I am dead?
If Mark Karpeles dies, who gets his, or my coins?
If I'm still alive when Mark Karpeles dies, would I get my coins back?  
Wouldn't you think he'd give them back before he dies?
I'm sure many agree.

In today's dollars?  It's more than I'll make in my lifetime...  
I am not alone, there are THOUSANDS of people, just, like, me.
Right now, Mark Karpeles has 2 options...
1.  Do the right thing and maybe be a Saint!
2.  Do the wrong thing, and rot in Hell...

Are you married?  Close siblings?  Parents?
I read a post, a recently widowed wife found a usb stick in the fireproof safe with seed words, asking how to use it to pay for the funeral.  My heart sank, but there's one idea how to leave your bitcoins.  
Nobody plans on dying anytime soon, then it happens before you can do anything.  I know this on a personal level and have suddenly lost family just like that.  Get your shit in order today bud!
I'm just not sure how "fireproof" fireproof safes are, USB could get toast.  Seeds need an even more secure method, I'm sure you are bright enough.
If I had my bitcoins back from Mark Karpeles, they would probably get etched/stamped into metal and placed in a special location.  
Or maybe UV tattoo the words, I first thought about UV invisible ink tattoo's in the mid 90's, my tattoo artist buddies thought it was a cool idea, it exists now and is a thing.
Always imagined that judge who has a swastika invisible tattoo'd on his forehead, in front of a rape case, when they bring out the UV light for the semen sample on the clothing...  Oops!  Now that would be a funny skit for youtube.  Perhaps I should do that, collect ad revenue and fly out to meet &amp; greet Mark Karpeles and personally convince him to return my bitcoins.  
The truth of the matter is, at the end of the day, if Mark Karpeles is reading this, he knows that I can get very, very creative.  I could probably make up something, and say it to him, and his reply could be, you know what!?  I'll do it!  Here's your bitcoins back!  ;)

I buy coffee from there regularly and usually get the Kona but I pulled some killer espresso shots with this coffee from Costa Rica.  OMG!

Due to pending lawsuits, I must decline to comment

You determine when the ride is over.  
How long have you been in?  Sounds like a short time if your "investment" is down.
What would I do in your situation?  Buy more, because it's on SALE right now!  Keep buying all the way down as far as it goes, as much as you can afford to loose.
Just don't ever let Mark Karpeles get his filthy hands on your shit, he's a liar and a thief! P.S. !KRAM UOY KCUF

Mark Karpeles should gift 100% of his public and private Bitcoin Fortune to the creditors, before someone pulls a James Riddle Hoffa... 
Mark, Do it for the family!

I want my BITCOINS back, Mark Karpeles!  
I want to put your cat Tibanne on a skewer and have a nice Kat-Kebab!  Then take a crap on your face.  You slime ball thief!
