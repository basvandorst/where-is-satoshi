It will give any institution the responsibility of holding your crypto assets for you.  Similar to them holding your shares of a company so they can be easily purchased/sold. If even 1% of everyone’s portfolio started to be transferred into crypto, it would ( in my opinion ) start taking off.  Most clauses in financial advisors contracts disallow them to purchase cryptocurrency, but this will allow them to be purchased *legally* as well.

PayPal is considered a bank now, so they can report all your transactions EVER if need be, this alone had me stop using it

“Worked at a bank” 
Yes it is to not allow you full access to your money. We would routinely give an order to a customer who owned a check cashing place and he would come in with a duffel bag and leave with usually around 15-20k in cash.  We did that because he was a strong business customer, but try and withdraw $3k+ randomly at a smaller branch is just about impossible without calling ahead.
