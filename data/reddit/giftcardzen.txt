We'll keep an eye out for them to buy from our sellers. Would love to have them.

Nope! Coinbase accepts any bitcoin. They give the option to send through coinbase...or to a bitcoin address.

Doh! We left that message in there as static...which is so completely confusing. It doesn't change based on what you actually get. Updating that now! Thanks for letting us know about your confusion. I'll update this comment when it's fixed on production.
edit: Updated on the site. Thanks again!

Sure is! We only allow you to buy electronic gift cards though...and note that most of our gift cards are only usable on the US website for that store. I can't guarantee that the card you buy will work overseas.

Absolutely heard. Added it to the list.

Completely agreed about the risk. The one option (which is still not vetted 100%) is to only pay once the card has been used. It's an interesting concept, but I agree that the snags may not be worth it at the moment.

We are using Coinbase for our processing. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:47:23
At the moment, we don't have the option. That's because FPO's are not the safest destinations for either party. That said, Bitcoin really changes that for us, and we'll be reassessing what we can do with how safe Bitcoin actually is.

To be honest, when we first integrated we didn't know people would want the transaction to go the other way. We've had a few requests for getting paid by BTC for cards. It's an interesting idea, and trust that we have already been putting some discussion towards it today.

Great question.  For people buying gift cards from us, we guarantee all cards 100%.  If you ever have an issue, we'll take care of you.
For people selling gift cards to us, they've passed through a thorough process to make sure they're a reputable seller, and their cards are solid.

Unfortunately, most of the gift cards we sell only work in the U.S. - We just opened up international buying mainly because of bitcion, but we can't guarantee that the cards will work anywhere but in the states.

We have Target, and get plenty (read: thousands of dollars worth) of cards go through us each week. They are picked up quickly, so best bet is to sign up for notifications for when we get them in stock.
re: your edit - We guarantee every single card we sell. The people we buy from go through a vetted process before actually selling to us. If you ever have an issue, just give us a call and we'll make all things right.

Very welcome!
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:38:54
Yup yup, exactly how phrased it.
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:55:18
Thanks for the order, we're glad you're happy!  Please let us know if there's anything we can improve.
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:39:52
We'll keep an eye out for them in the market. I don't think many people want to rid of them once they have them though. I'll ping you if I see any show up. Thanks for the suggestion.

We often have iTunes in stock, but it goes out the door really quickly. People don't tend to get rid of their Amazon cards, so they are extremely rare. 
update: We should be getting some more iTunes in this week.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:41:43
Just sent you a PM. We'll take care of ya :-)
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:23:18
Oh man, you are so right. Just updated the image to a generic one. Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:08:43
Thanks for the compliment!
I don't believe we've sent out your Amazon card yet. We haven't sent out any $5 Amazon cards today. Your order was early and you should be **getting a $25 card** shortly.  PM me your order number and I'll make sure it happens.
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:37:51
Sure do! We have one in stock right now, but as you can imagine those sell out within a day of us getting them. If you sign up for notifications you can easily snag a bunch.
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:48:35
Yikes.  We don't know beep_boop_bop.  No idea how to prove that though to your satisfaction.  Ideas?  He is a new customer, and this was his first order.
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:12:42
Thanks so much Justin! Your Amazon card is on it's way. Did you get it?
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:00:42
It's truly our pleasure. You guys are awesome. Best of luck buying your first coins!
