There is no widget as of yet. The idea is set up alerts for price targets  / changes and just forget about it (that is if the price is not reached soon enough, like yesterday for example:)
A widget requires more frequent data usage, whereas the pushed notifications require literally nothing, unless you open up the app, which triggers a refresh.

Sorry, only mtgoxUSD at this time. If the app catches on, we will add more currencies, other markets, as well as more complicated rules.
USD has the highest volume by far at this stage, that is why it was our first choice.

Great for you! We have been involved in the Android market for some years now (before being professional programmers who got enough of the corporate environment), and that is quite far (very far indeed) from the norm. So we really didn't think about it this way - and got caught by surprise, to be honest (the first question is after all "where is the source":)
This was an initial (but fully functional) release, we will see where we take it from here. Depends on feedback as well as interest. We are not against releasing the source, if that is what the community of users will  demand. We do need to find a way to support the operation though, which has to be a little different with open source.

Plain and simple: client validates subscription using Google Play, server is dumb in this regards (for now) and any custom built client could use the server.

Though we did consider this, the feature set will remain small for some time - the primary goal is pushed notifications, so you don't have to keep watching the price for movements.
Placing orders will most likely not be implemented any time soon. We are not brave enough :)

I see your point, however the functionality we provide is not possible without internet permission. Do you only use open source apps on your phone (even not Bitcoin related)?
We have published the app on the Android market, thus associating the app with an entity - sleekbit, taking any credit as well as responsibility.

..hmm haven't thought about opensourcing it, but its definitely an option. We just need to find a way to cover associated server costs.
