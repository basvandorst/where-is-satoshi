Lol what? Setting up a ledger is as easy as it gets, they literally guide you every step on the way. Did you buy it from ledger or did you get it somewhere else?

I dont mean to bash you, im just talking generally. The sudden urge people get to fomo back in when prices go parabolic is exacly what manipulators want, and is why so many people get burned. We have been sitting around 6k for months, and nothing fundamental changed yesterday to support a sudden 20% increase. The risk of it dumping again is very much still there, so dont let your emotions get to you.
