I started buying from 20 bucks up. Stopped at 70 or so. 
Have been selling 90% of my stash from 1000 to 600. 
I'll keep the last 10% in case Bitcoin will go up again, which i doubt but who knows. 
Many early adopters already cashed out and are enjoying their cars and houses. The gold rush is over. I did well. So thank you if you bought my coins.

Yes i see that the financial system is going to shit. I just didn't realize it's a fact that everyone will turn to Bitcoin instead. But thanks for letting me know.

Wow. Why? Why would i talk nonsense. What's the point. He asked to share your story. If you think i'm the only early adopter who cashed already i'm gonna have to dissapoint you. 
I don't understand the hostility and downvoting. What am i doing wrong?
I think Bitcoin is great and will be used for a lot of things. Are people mad i cashed out at a higher price or something? Do people blame me for that?

No i don't think it's over. Bitcoin itself is doing well and will be doing well for stuff where other payment options fail. Darknet payments, transfers to remote areas and stuff like that. 
It's just that after 6 years there are no signs of mainstream adoption and i see no reason why this suddenly would change. 
The 1200 price was pure hype and possibly manipulation. And not because the world moved to Bitcoin. 
But like i said who knows.

Excuse me but i'm new here and wonder if it's normal to get downvoted for sharing my story, as the title asked me to do?

A chart without numbers is pretty much useless.
