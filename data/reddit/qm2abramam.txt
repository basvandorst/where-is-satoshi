Every 100% gain you will sell 10%
At 1000% you will have sold all BTC
Impossible to 10X if you sold ANY before your 1000% gain.
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:40:33
You'll never 10x your money with this strategy, but it is a safe play.

Guys like this only participate in markets rampant in corruption run by themselves and their friends, there's no way for them to rob and steal in this market so basically its just them trying to mislead the uninformed.
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:29:06
Thats a buy signal!
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:54:41
Not if you sell 2% at every 20% rise. Do the math again

How can you not understand a log chart?  Its a chart with price and time data. Any competent person knows how to read a chart. Western censorship at its finest

@_date: 2019-09-26 02:21:04
Laws, common sense, and government cannot coexist together.  You can only have two, never three

Schiff must be under some serious pressure from his investors. His clients understand the impending doom  Of the dollar, yet missing out on huge crypto gains. Good luck Peter and remember the bitcoin community would welcome you with open arms
