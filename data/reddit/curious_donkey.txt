You have to realize the FED are just a group of people that handle pretty much the dollar's ideal "strength". They hand out loans to our country and establish the interest of what we're "supposedly" pay back. The rates have to do with inflation pretty much. Everything as you noticed as a consumer is going up in price (gas, milk, fast food, apartments, whatever) whatever you're buying now, was a lot cheaper 6 six years ago. And the cuts in rates is pretty much to stable loans, keeps interest low so other banks are willing to borrow from the central bank.
Remember it's all bullshit. The dollar is made up from thin air just like everything else including crypto.

Not to worried unless you got anything above 10K
Remember it's an 'asset' not a source of income. Besides the IRS is struggling with budget cuts and downsizing.

You mean Proof of Work or you referring to POW token on ETC block chain it's practically the same as any other coin. Energy expenditure, is complex stuff to be mixing with currency although not impossible. Maybe one day and it's technically made up of thin air too if you think on it XD.

Nothing, hopefully this move helps the FED collapse. The moment you see Cryptos true potential is when the market collapses again. That's when we'll see if it was all worth it. Gold 2.0.

XD relax. I mean the best way to explain anything is with food around. Through text it can be misinterpreted in many ways. Youtube is probably your best bet. Do your own research, learn to research.

Bitcoin is only at a negative if you bought above 8K. Not for people that jumped in at 3K or way before 2017.
