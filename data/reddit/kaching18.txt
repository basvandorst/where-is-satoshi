Then keep your negativity to yourself and don’t respond.  Simple enough.

I read of a situation where you could store your entire file on your phone.  Might be good if traveling.  Also, there are many similar/same-named people whose records can get mixed up.

I’m hearing BTC may work for real estate transactions so that may be a way to go, either buy or pay off an existing loan.

It’s part of the estate.  If there’s no will, it will likely go through probate, wouldn’t it?
And CB (or whatever exchange) couldn’t legally just hand it over.  There’s tax implications as well, even if it’s $50. 
Not a lawyer but I think that’s how it would play out.

I’ve personally met people who not only did well with BTC, but also made over 100k on what would be considered a penny stock.  The timing is ripe, I believe, for investments in crypto.

And that is?

Ever listened to Andreas antonopoulos on YouTube?   He believes BTC will be store of value and that it will be used to move large chunks of money around.  
Why are newly formed ETFs including BTC?   At some point in the future it may fall by the wayside, but I think it will be okay for a while.

Maybe listen to Andreas antonopoulos on YouTube.   He discusses BTC in his videos and presents a compelling argument for it.

What did you mean by two years before the next halvening?   Never heard about that before.   How does that work?

People always throw out the term, “greed.”  What’s wrong with excitement at watching something go up and wanting financial well-being to be able to take care of your family, or having a new vision for the future?  Greed is when you become consumed by acquiring money, tokens.  Balance is the key.   
As this new era gets underway, it’s fun to be in at the start.  I agree that a gradual uptick is a great way to proceed.  I’ve been learning about Elliott wave and it’s really fascinating to watch the patterns. 
Will things go down?   Sure.  But it just creates another buying opportunity.

Get a trezor.

Thank you.   
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:11:26
Yep

Depending on when you bought, capital gains taxes are going to take a huge chunk of your gains, so what’s the point?
Unless I’m missing something, it’s probably best to HODL.

Which wallet do you have?

And that’s what I have a hard time understanding about trading.  With fees and taxes, it would really have to be worth your while to sell. 
Some video I watched, the guy made like $20 in 2-3 minutes.  I don’t think he was in the US.  But for the expenditure of energy and bookkeeping alone, it really wouldn’t be worth it to me.

The IRS is not someone to mess with.  Render unto Caesar and call it a day. 
I have witnessed a couple people who had to deal with them.   It goes on forever.  They put a freeze on your passport.  You have to jump through a lot of hoops. 
Spare yourself the gray hair

Would be nice if true.

Institutional investors lurking around.   The market falls, they swoop in and buy.  At some point the little guy will not be able to get in anymore.  
Depending on how long you’ve held, if it’s less than a year, 10-37%capital gains.   More than a year is 24%.   Add in the transaction fees.   Figure out whether it’s worth your while to take profit.

Thx for the laugh!

We may, but I’ve read it will dip again.  Then the bull run.
