If segwit fails on litecoin, then I expect a massive dump that brings price back to sub $4, lower than LTC was prior to this pump. It would mean the literal death of Litecoin. I hope you didn't buy in recently because it seems like LTC bull rally was short lived and has already died.

Why don't you bitcoiners put your money where your mouth is and convert all your altcoins + some of your BTC to LTC? Lets make this puppy moon.

Don't miss out. You had 2 years to buy LTC at $4; that qas crypto's most epic shakeout in history. LTC rally isn't even a week old, and SegWit isn't even activated yet...

To anyone who owns bitcoin and believes in it:
1. Litecoin is essentially the same thing. It's literally an **improved** copy of Bitcoin.
2. Litecoin has already dealt with the issues Bitcoin is currently dealing with.
3. The second SegWit and LN activates for Litecoin, it will **instantly** become the most progressive and useful (true) cryptocurrency out there.
4. It is not a pump and dump, it has a solid and very long history, and its owner is known and trusted in the community. 
So, with that in mind, why haven't you converted (at least some) of your BTC to LTC yet? 
Also: LTC was stable at $4 for almost 2 years. Massive accumulation has been going on. The price went up 100% in the last week, true. But a reversal of such a long bear trend does not last only 1 or 2 weeks, but usually at least 2 months. LTC could very easily break its ATH (like BTC broke its ATH earlier this year).

hi how are you

Soon, Bitcoin will be the pathetic clone of Litecoin! What a turn of events!
*Loading my LTC bags, this shit is going to Jupiter once Segwit and LN activates. Did you know it will reach 70% within a week?*
