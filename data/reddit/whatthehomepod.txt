Only for Android.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:45:36
Ah I thought you meant Samourai which is Android only..
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:37:15
Monero is though.

Alright. So I tested a few iOS wallets but they are all extremely buggy or non-userfriendly. Any recommendations? I would love to have just one app for Bitcoins and Lightning instead of having all kinds of differents.

Yeah I understand that but I don’t support companies that doesn’t understand the philosophy behind crypto’s

Yeah I know, but I’d prefer something like Green Wallet and the fact that Breez Wallet supports a Visa/Mastercard is for me enough to step away from this country. Blue Wallet, I don’t like the UX.

What happens when I’m over the max?

Oh wait I forgot. GPS inside a phone only acts like a receiver as well. Nevermind.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:47:53
Ass or pie? Congrats.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:08:12
They can’t use GPS?
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:50:58
Wow! Nobody gave me something and I really needed it. Thanks! I don’t know how much but thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:39:55
Me too
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:53:15
Thank you

In undeveloped places they are using sms to pay for things. And there are even a few services that sends/receive Bitcoin with sms.

Give me GTA and I will be allday there.

Alright then I will leave it for now on bottle.li. I hope they make them a little bit user friendly because with all those channels and all its currently not. It would be perfect that a wallet automatically switch when using a small amount the Lightning Network and a high amount using Bitcoin. So that the user doesn’t need to know the technique behind it.
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:01:07
Well thanks anyways. So can I sent it to a regular address?
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:16:36
Both suck

Bitcoin apps are back in the App Store. Apple is releasing CryptoKit with iOS 13 as well.
