Shit, just my bad luck. I haven't used Gox for several months and now I was just going to send some BTC through them, using them as a half-ass mixer. And now 10 BTC is stuck. Or lost...

Only problem: SEPA takes up to 3 weeks right now. Their Polish bank has low withdrawal limits.

Good for you. 
I finally gave up on them today. Fifty-something days without anything. (since mid June) Really pisses me off.
Asked for a cancellation and got it right away . Moving my coins elsewhere.

You don't need to know anything about bitcoin to answer this one. 
"Micro" means 1/1000 000. 
So 10 000 * 1/1000 000 = 0.001 
Edit: stupid mistake (just woke up...)

I almost can't believe he said that. Seemed like a pretty knowledgeable guy in his other comments . My jaw dropped to the floor when I heard it...
Someone should tell him how wrong he is.

I like the term 'glorified accounting book'. Tell me why gold is not one of those, though...

In the current state, the bitcoin system will not scale to millions of transactions per day. The devs are working on that one though. Other than that, I would say no.

You might be human, but there's also a high probability you are an SD employee...

I recommend that you read up on 'colored coins'. Pretty cool stuff.

This will create a lucrative market for private sellers. 
(Travel to Cyprus with a big brainwallet, sell bitcoins at nice rates)

Four years ago today, bitcoin was only four months old, and only  Satoshi and a handful of others were mining.

This is huge! 
Latest user count I could find was 1 million but that was in 2012.

No, not at all. 
Colored coins make it possible to do what you want (if I got you right) by piggybacking the bitcoin blockchain.

Nice one!

Thanks. 
What would be the best client to use in that scenario? 
Given that I would have to install it from scratch everytime I want to transfer money, it would have to be quick and easy to install.

Four years? The only way for that to be true is if you are Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:20:28
Sounds promising! Thanks.

It's over 9000!
