...because a guy who soldered motherboards in the 70's knows best when it comes to international monetary economics.

Also keep in mind that it doesn't take much effort for an exchange (I'm this case, Bitfinex) to conduct an audit of their reserves. Shouldn't be too much to ask from an exchange that turns over billions daily.

The reason it's all forward looking is because very little has actually happened in terms of meaningful real world use. That's just a fact.

You've canceled all withdrawals, it's a STOP, so don't sugarcoat it.
Also, my local bank can fix their systems without halting their operations, so your analogy doesn't work at all.
You are a disgrace to the community.

In hindsight, after all the debacles we've seen over the past few years, why oh why did people stick with it for this long?

...and before he did research, he claimed everyone who bought Bitcoin was a moron.

If so, that's nine lives worth of dead cat bounces. Up $600 from the lows... We've turned the corner.

Investors move markets, agreed. However, investors react to news. Just because you discover patterns in markets after the fact, does not mean that you can predict the future movement in markets. There is no god-given direction inherent in markets that can be deciphered using TA, and you're about to learn this the hard way.

Sorry to say, but that's complete technobabble horseshit. You TS fellows sound sophisticated looking at the price action that went by, but every time a news development happens, your fancy graphs and theory go flying right out the window.

The only thing worse than selling low and buying high, is convincing your mom to sell low and buy high.

What happens when/if the CME BTC instruments become larger than the underlying exchanges? The 'hedges' influence or dictate the price. This is exactly what's been happening to gold and silver for years.
Moreover, what happens when a panicked central bank with infinite fiat pockets wants to 'hedge' against a surging crypto industry?

This is a real world example of how far we are from BTC being an actual, realistic pragmatic solution. Most BTC holders are more excited about the price movement rather than the actual use of the currency as a payment method though.

It kind of sucks with Bitcoin too, though.

You refuted your own rebuttal there, claiming that the 'hallmark of a bubble is when an asset is priced so far above its "true" or "fair" value that it will inevitably crash down'. Bitcoin's intrinsic value is zero, hence it is theoretically trading far above its fair value.

Since when does raising legitimate concerns about a virtual asset going parabolic equal to 'shitting on bitcoin'?
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:51:16
Incorrect. Gold is divisible up until a certain point; the point at which you can no longer realistically carry nor store that small a grain of gold. With BTC, that point has far been exceeded and will continue to head in this direction.
