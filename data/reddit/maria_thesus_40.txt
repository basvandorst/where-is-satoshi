No, I think Electrum only supports Bitcoin.

The problem with we have with bitcoin compared to fiat, is the fact that fiat has little to no chance of dropping to zero value. This is because it is backed by real/public people of power (like the Queen of England) and governments/institutions (USA/Europe/etc). All of them hold tangible assets like buildings and lands.
This shows a clear disadvantage in bitcoin, there is no one and nothing backing it. Its just us, providing speculation and **hope** that it will be something more in the future, thus we are going back to the self-fulfilling prophecy as described above.
Lets *hope* things go well.

It is a subjective value based on speculation and greed. My humble opinion, is that the current bitcoin value is based on the Greater Fool Theory, which you can read here:

My suggestion, is to ask a real accountant.
Imagine the discussion with your local tax authority: Hey Mr.Tax man, yes I had some BTC which I invested into BCH and now I converted everything back into fiat currency. Can I prove any of the above? No of course not....  what? money laundering? But asked this reddit dude and he told me I was ok...

Take a look at Electrum: 
Secure, with lots of important features like cold-storage.

Send wealth, that is the key here.
If the value of bitcoin drops to zero, you'll be sending some digital data that aren't characterised as "wealth" but as nothing but digital air. The whole essence of this wealth depends on the receiving party to actually accept it as such. So we are going back to the Greater Fool Theory, as described above.

I like Electrum, open source, great support and lots of new features in development. The only downside, is that it only supports bitcoin and no altcoins.
If you code, then you will also love the JSON API and the command line daemon.

It is impossible to know if they actually do any mining, or if they are a pyramid scam. When you hear about referrals, that immediately should raise red flags and loud alarms.
I would only trust them, if they are based in my country or another nearby country and I can just go there and see the mining operation myself. Pretty pictures over the internet and live feeds showing data centre rooms are just thin air.
Would you give someone 30,000 $ or € to buy a car that you have seen in pretty photos over the internet? or on a live video feed? I don't think so.

Well, Exodus is not really open source, we can't read and profile the code, so that is the first red flag that things are not well. A wolf wearing a beautiful skin?
Still, there are many other ways to steal coins, running Windows to manage coins is a Bad Idea (TM), there is a really interesting malware that modifies recipient addresses in the Windows memory during copy/paste. Thus you copy a legitimate address to send funds to, you paste it and the result is a different address modified by the malware.
Anyway, it is impossible to know what is going on in your situation, but first start by running a Linux wallet that supports cold-storage or at least try Exodus under Linux. If you can't figure it out, contact Exodus for help.

They don't seem to be doing anything important.
Looking at the code commits on github, they seem to be just making minor or insignificant updates to how the Core builds, or minor changes to testnet and even fixing spelling mistakes. 
I guess they expect to add the Lightning Network to the Core?
Since the Lightning Network is being sponsored by corporations and developed and paid by them, maybe some of the Core developers have joined their team.

It is all greed and speculation, driven by marketing. 
* greed: There is no real essence in bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. But there is a *driving greed* to make money and to speculate as to what will happen in the future. Thus, the two combined forces drive people to invest in bitcoin, which raises the demand (and affects supply), in turn raising prices.
* speculation: Currently, the upward movement is really based on the Greater Fool Theory (which you can read here: 
* marketing: But is it a bubble? If the marketing part I mentioned above manages to make a real dent on society, then bitcoin will become a self-fulfilling prophecy (which you can read about here:  the result will be a bitcoin price that of which none of us ever dreamed about! If the marketing fails to deliver the change needed, then it will all fall like a tower of cards...

Search and read about cold storage. 
The idea, is to have multiple wallets. Do you go around holding all your assets? No, you store most in your local bank and you go around with a small amount for daily expenses. The same can be done with bitcoins, have a cold storage wallet with most of your bitcoins and keep a second live wallet for daily usage.
Look at the electrum wallet:

We moved to a custom implementation for bitcoin payments on our e-shop. We don't support many payment options but at least we control our own system.

The problem is not how many bitcoins are out there, but how they are distributed around the world. In essence, most bitcoins are being held in a limited number of addresses controlled by few individuals. At any time in the future, some of them could decide to dump their bitcoins and that would cause a total collapse.
