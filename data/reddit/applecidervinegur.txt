I'm right there w/you OP. Without any herbal influences, I've been throwing every dollar I can find at Bitcoin. I'm a pretty cash poor dude, but somehow keep finding ways to slowly accumulate more and more. Not one of my friends, with far more resources, has believed enough to buy any.
 I'm also a little tired of the generic "don't gamble more than you can afford to lose" banter. I'm optimistically inspired enough by Bitcoin's potential, that I prefer the "acquire as much Bitcoin as you possibly can, without literally starving for the next 3-5 years."  If this is the biggest disruption to ever hit finance, people will tell their friends in the future how they "could have bought in" before Bitcoin was in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands... But they preferred to buy a new car or take out a fat mortgage or buy some lame stocks at the peak of the market.

Hello Patrick,
I would really like to know whether you personally support integrating more anonymity into the Bitcoin protocol?
As it currently stands, it appears to present substantial privacy problems, revealing one's entire Bitcoin wealth to anyone that they interact with... Unless someone wants to fracture their accounts across countless wallets and/or store their accounts with a larger entity (which seems to ignore the real advantage to be one's own bank).

Not blindly, not on this scale, and definitely not so publicly. He wasn't even this visible with his huge first round investment in Tesla. That investment took about 10 years to hit (30x).

The important thing is locking in a substantial position.

If one can trade on an Official Coinbase exchange, I'm don't see the real point of trading on an ETF. Especially as I would expect an ETF purchase would not give you the most Bitcoin for your buck (as ETF requires it's own management fees/auditing/maintenance.) Also, the ETF would seem to me to be a rougher representation of what Bitcoin is Worth, as opposed to holding a specific amount of Bitcoin, which is transferable across the world 24/7. Plus, if one is worried about holding and getting hacked, Coinbase has their own insurance in addition to the Vault feature.

Have fun fighting the current of progress and the future. You and Ted Kazinsky, allowing the fear of new technology to completely dominate your every thought.  Youre trying to say why Bitcoin is irrelevant, and yet... you can't stop reading about it, thinking about it. It's already permanently lodged in your brain, INCEPTION style.         The beautiful thing about all of us in the Bitcoin community, is that, when you're finally secure enough to come out... learn to love yourself for who you REALLY are, and stop blaming everyone else for your latent insecurities... we will be happy to help you dispose of that antiquated fiat currency of yours.

I would tend to agree with those that feel Silk Road really helped Bitcoin to get started. It still seems to be one of the only practical applications where Bitcoin is hands down the superior currency. Microsoft, Dell, Overstock... glad to see them accepting Bitcoin, but the practical advantage/incentive for the user is nothing compared to Bitcoin's ability to exploit an entirely new global market on Silk Road.

Very enouraging to see Greg so focused on incorporating Privacy into Bitcoin Core. He really broke down, what I would view, a slam dunk argument as to why Bitcoin needs privacy built in to be truly fungible... to live up to its full potential. 
The lack of privacy is still the most glaring flaw in Bitcoin. Inspiring to know that sharp people like Greg are thinking this way and actively involved in improving it.

Dude, well said, true dat. If the Twinz were simply agnostic about incorp privacy into bitcoin core, that wouldn't be so bad, but they've actually championed the government's ability to track every transaction. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:24:08
That level of power, so close to our borders... is frankly terrifying. People in Minnesota, Wisconsin would live in constant terror. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:22:15
That is pure brilliance!! Great find! Def have to repatriate modern day Stewart for a Bitcoin marathon of ads... in a variety of spots around the world (Kenya, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Greece, Russia, etc)
@_date: 2015-09-24 23:25:35
Lets do it... privacy has to be addressed. That's the biggest elephant in the room... after block size. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:01:01
home of Krugman... The Tech-Phobic QE Loving Statist... bet he's still in complete denial of bitcoin's relevance, even after this.  
@_date: 2015-09-03 06:04:31
WTF is wrong with you... that you can't even tolerate feedback on the protocol? It's not some sacred untouchable holy relic. It will evolve. If you're so twitchy and insolent at disagreeable feedback... you ought to go back to your online gaming and stop interacting with living humans. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:36:55
Not impressed by Summers much at all. A lot of long drawn out pauses, overly measured in his responses like some politician in a political debate... super light on meaningful feedback (mostly empty generic generalities). 
Also, the guy sounds like a cardboard statist... "fiat currencies are perfectly fine, gov can shut bitcoin down anytime it wants, poses no threat to nation state sovereignty, etc, etc, etc."
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:10:10
When people make fun of NY accents, southern accents, Boston accents, etc... is that racist?  Bit of a leap. 
To brand the Argentine gov't racist for that seems like a hyper-PC reaction. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:50:36
Gavin's got game... appreciate his desire to see predictability with block sizes just like predictability of new coins. 
Also, appreciate notion that the reward should have prob decreased more continuously as well, without sudden halving. 
As much as a finite supply of 21 million contributes to scarcity/value... does seem that the reward should continue indefinitely, to continuously incentivize miners. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:49:52
As encouraging as it is to see Circle and bitcoin operations expanding... would kind of prefer to see the cancerous evil empire of Goldman Sachs miss the train on this one and get left behind to die a miserable death... like Lehman Bros. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 15:45:10
Not too late to keep accumulating.... when it's $10k+ a coin people will look back at the current prices and think it was pennies on the dollar.
@_date: 2016-10-13 19:02:11
The Blockstream internet information police mob is indeed a true threat to Bitcoin's health. Good point Szabo.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:32:15
The return of the Prodigal Price Point is worthy of some hi-fives... fives all around for our bit bro!!
@_date: 2016-10-02 17:32:48
Let the whole corrupt/idiotic country burn... and be replaced with some rational thinkers using crypto
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:39:03
I'm gonna' place my bet on 21 surprising you. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:48:33
Privacy... Bitcoin needs to integrate privacy into core so your every move can't be tracked... lack of privacy takes away from fungibility
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:20:24
Warning signs were all over the place... shoulda' increased block size until longterm solution avail, but nope... let's give every Alt in the universe an opportunity to take more market share
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:42:45
Oh, this is pure greatness. Bravo Sir!
@_date: 2015-11-03 03:40:24
I keep looking, trying to find some holes in your analysis, a minor neglected detail maybe... but that's as air tight as it comes, sure can't argue with the math... the numbers just don't lie. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:28:47
Big funding is encouraging, but it's the people behind it that resonate most for me. Bilaji wouldn't have left his other duties at A16Z if he didn't have a lot of faith in this. That dude is dialed in, as is Marc Andressen. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:14:00
Way to give the people what they want!!!
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:55:02
Let it ride Brahhhh! 
No risk... No reward. You're Gonna' want to start looking at ocean front property now, to feel out what's best for you, for when Bitcoin goes ballistic in next 3-5yrs. Also might want to start interviewing man servants. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:45:41
Bilaji Shrinivasan (CEO of 21) is definitely a very bright guy. And the folks at A16Z (primary VC fund backing 21) are dialed in, imho. The fact that Bilaji left his full time gig with A16Z to go full time w/21... does suggest to me, there's big potential here.  
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:49:40
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:20:40
Yeah... zerohedge was getting ridiculously zealous on that one.
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:25:31
But is it... really? A superior currency to all others on the planet?
@_date: 2015-10-15 04:12:05
Yup... that's the strike price when I'll think about selling. Everything pre $10k... that's still make it/break it experimentation time. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:42:38
Because his enemies, the Winkelvii, are huge stakeholders/promoters. 
IMHO... Zucky should buy 200,000 BTC. That way... he'll profit even more than Winksterz, remove the conflict of interest. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:19:32
So... Either your daughters will have zero money in their college account in 10 years... (Which is fine cuz college is a conformist scam) or they'll be millionaires and can skip it all together. The Internet can teach them anything their interested in,at a more comprehensive level for free anyway.
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:10:08
What a surprise... Lawsky likes people that frequently engage law enforcement... regulatory capture anyone?
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:34:56
I didn't think that was the case. Thought Finney was in Santa Barbara and Dorian outer parts of Los Angeles.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:28:04
If you or someone could convert this linguistic libertarian goodness into a graphic representation (w/out words)... would be most tight. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 16:21:41
Appreciate the feedback zero hedge... but for more legitimacy maybe clean up the spelling and some of the facts, bitcoin market cap around $4 billion, not 3.
@_date: 2015-10-22 16:04:19
This is purrrty frickin' sweet!  That's more that can be said of the IRS, treating it like a commodity, rather than a "service." 
Hopefully the U.S. will wake the eff up and quit getting all Lawsky (over regulating) on bitsky the newborn coin. In this regard, hope we do as they do in Europa. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:50:12
When you believe... you buy it whenever you can buy it. I've been doin the same, following it all over, prob follow it all the way back up to $1k before I start trying to hunker down on holdings. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:55:46
A lot of the 21 hate seems to be from short minded folks that are only looking at the 21 computer as a mining device. It's NOT primarily designed to mine people... wake up... for one, you don't have to wait 10 minutes for bitcoin confirmations anymore, instantaneous transactions amongst 21 machines is a pretty big deal. There are clearly a lot more possibilities now of integrating micro payments with the web. For all those that had said micropayments weren't feasible because of high transaction fees, this is also a serious counterpoint. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:34:36
I just paid $1.80 to get my transaction through, higher and higher friction not good. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:46:47
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:03:34
Yes, everyday that goes by that Lawsky HAS NOT said anything, I consider a good thing. Lawsky has no clue what he's doing, his first draft proposal was an abomination. Would much rather give the ecosystem more time to build out, before they try to cram it into a one-size-fits-all mold (that can't properly anticipate future development/innovation).
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:55:11
Thanks for article, I'll definitely give it a read. My comments were largely a response to his constant criticism of privatization of UK mail system, criticism of high property rates in UK and endorsing Russel Brands attempt to establish market ceiling on rents, support on ban of all fracking, blatant refrain to criticize any Russian policy makes him appear almost bought off by RT. He also seems to support government sponsored health care at times. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:26:36
That certainly could be the case. I was struck by the fact that he transitioned from his broad activities at A16Z to go full time exclusively as CEO of 21, as significant, at least to me. Esp as Bilaji has been a founder of other successful/innovative tech (Counsyl). I don't see him going "all in" on his time if he didn't think this was huge. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:41:37
Less money for gov the better, less money for the pathetic public education monopoly system the better. The more Bitcoin takes power away from centralized gov... all the mo' betta'
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:48:21
all will be okay, bitcoin  will be there with you for the long haul
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:27:43
Alpha Dog taking the point, nii-hiiice... reminds me of that oft quoted passage in the First Book of Satoshi, where Satoshi said to the Fiscally Wise Parent "when you walk walk wit Bitcoin, show through actions, always so much more impressionable than when scream in street like crazy firecracka" 
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:17:59
Thanks Brahhs!
Been cutting the commerce grass with the ole' Lawnmower App for a little while... nice slow n' steady way to accumulate the immortal coin of the almighty.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:11:52
 Exxxxactly... just like Obama Care legislation architect/million dollar consultant Gerber (Attention Whore &amp; complete jackass).
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:45:12
If Coinbase only charges 1% to switch back and forth from Bitcoin to local currency... couldn't residents of the 30+ countries Coinbase services, only pay 2% to send currency from one country to another? That would se like a much cheaper method of remittance.
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:43:25
Agreed, the guy often gets me amped on his pro Bitcoin decentralization hype.. but then, inevitably, he spews broad paranoia towards virtually everything, eventually slamming the free market, coming off as pro socialist, pro big government, anti decentralization, biting his own tail... and uh Yeahhh... the Dude is coked up out of his head, sounds like Crusty the Clown going ballistic on geo/finance/politics. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:07:41
Lawsky reminds me of some dumb fat attention whore record exec that just came across the coolest edgiest rock band and forces them to cover Barry Manilow.
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:47:45
People on this sub have so much venom towards Coinbase they come off as desperate haters. Go bow down to your Blockstream tyrants.
