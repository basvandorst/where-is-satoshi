Where on the Vaal? We are riding bike around there next weekend, might pop in!
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:29:32
Yeah, I am using greenaddress instead...

Agreed - The people I know who got into BTC recently are swapping BTC for alts now due to the fees.   New users are really frustrated by all this nonsense...  
I also need to move some BTC off an exchange to cold storage, but exchanges are making the fees crazy due to the clogged up mempool.  Sigh

Our government is LITERALLY full of communists.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:19:21
Welcome to reddit...  Where everything is a repost ;)
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:27:35
We are buying Bitcoin, that is what we are up to... To protect ourselves against our corrupt, communist government which wants to nationalize everything, including the reserve bank...  Long live BTC, long live.
@_date: 2014-04-24 13:41:23
This, and more particularly, fuck the central banks and all their central planning!

I used premiumgiftcards cards last night.  Was very quick, less than 10 mins to get my wallet code.  Previously it had taken a bit longer for some reason.  Haven't tried steambitshop, will do that next time! :) Thanks

This is not about which economic model I prefer... I cannot control this in the slightest.  
This is about protecting my wealth against a state which is corrupt and hellbent on self enrichment at the cost of their citizens.  A state which loots tax payer money meant for service delivery to the poorest of the poor.  A state so incompetent \(due to cadre deployment\) that it cannot even properly run a municipality, clinic or hospital, never mind something more complicated like a bank or the reserve bank.  A state which wants to expropriate my home without compensation therefore depriving me of property rights.  A state which has protected the \(ex\) president facing 783 charges of corruption for 14 years and counting.  A state under which violent crime has spiraled out of control, giving SA one of the highest murder rates per capita and the reputation for being the rape capital of the world.
Is this a state under which you want to live? Is this a state you trust to protect your hard earned wealth?

I have seen this before.  It was excellent!
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:18:53
Very interesting!

The sidebar has some useful info - Give it a read.

Humble gaming bundle was my first purchase (We are not really spoilt for choice yet in South Africa).
@_date: 2014-10-22 11:42:07
Thanks for this!!

If I ever visit Sydney I will pay you in BTC.  Keep spreading the word, mate!
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:49:41
Oh haai! :)

Thank you for your generosity kind stranger! :)

I also used eclair wallet to buy cellphone time on bitrefill.  I am super impressed, was really "lightning" quick! The killer app has arrived!

The only other NZ dollar denominated exchange that I can find is   Good luck mate.

South Africa already has a very well developed financial sector (Approximately 20% GDP Q4 2014).  We are already well integrated into the financial world.  Bitcoin is another tool we can add to the arsenal, but bitcoin's potential in Africa lies north of SA's borders (Many migrant and seasonal workers need to send money home).  At this stage, bitcoin is mostly a speculative investment and a way to diversify my portfolio.

My local currency for the past year. [USD vs ZAR](
Bitcoin is not too bad!
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:28:52
Have you by any chance tried 
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:07:39
Agreed, I am also from SA and hedging myself accordingly.
@_date: 2015-02-16 11:46:29
I agree, however as a person living in South Africa, my purchasing power over the last 3-4 years has effectively halved in USD terms.  BTC is not *that* bad considering it is still in its infancy. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:06:28
Yeah... Why not? It would be great to see a country do this and see how well bitcoin holds up. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:47:25
Awesome, just bought some for 917.905USD :)
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:18:15
[bitx]( if you are in South Africa.
@_date: 2013-08-14 19:33:51
Great bundle! At least the money goes to charity and not to EA.
