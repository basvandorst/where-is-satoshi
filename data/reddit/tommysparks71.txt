One of my transactions is on the list so it looks like I will need help

Just to let everyone know this is not a scam &amp; like Sureshok I received my BCH as promised &amp; would advise others who's coins were locked up &amp; on the list to do the same better to have something rather than nothing.
For me the sleepless nights are over too, although I only received 70% of my funds, with the price going up over the last week I can count my lucky stars that the situation could of been a lot worse.
I would like to thank bchsegwitrecover personally for helping to retrieve my coins for me - he/she/them showed morals where others failed rightly or wrongly depending on your view I am pleased I was helped anyway so thank you.
My Fatal transaction was only done 8 days ago, I was trying to send the coins all 33.1 of them back to the cex.io exchange for a quick profit lessons learned I will be Hodling my BCH &amp; BTC From now on just stupid to trade rather than hold long term. 
Playing with your life savings is not a good Idea so this stupid idiot has learnt a valuable lesson.
As easy as it is to complete transactions in micro seconds, I'm sure we all take it for granted sometimes with the speed &amp; ease of this wonderful technology &amp; should be more careful in the future.
The mistake was my own doing I accept that, however these exchanges that make a mint off of everyone show no consumer protection or liability &amp; for financial institutions this is just criminal they do not provide any consumer protection for any of us &amp; this has to change.
I would expect them to know the in's &amp; out's of there own services/platforms they choose to use for financial gain for consumer protection &amp; add warning notices to any deposit &amp; withdrawal addresses highlighting the following "Warning Please make sure the address for this transaction is for the correct Blockchain Platform" it is disgusting that they refuse to help their consumers they are running a legal Financial Business &amp; as such should take responsibility to protect us all RANT OVER - 
As for the change in January to the BCH address format this cannot come soon enough!
With all the greed in the world the OP could of kept them all so their is some Moral Justification in taking the initiative to retrieve peoples coins at a fee I am pleased I used his services.
Also I would like to thank the Article writer &amp; provider on Bitcoin.com &amp; this Forum for the story &amp; Links otherwise I would of had more sleepless nights, as a novice un-tech savvy consumer until the article was issued I was in no mans land &amp; fighting with the exchange for consumer protection &amp; help of which they no nothing about.
Anyway it's been &amp; interesting emotional topic i give you that :-)

Thank you &amp; likewise, yes the poor soul that sent the 81.5 BCH I do hope for them they read reddit or see the article ��!
Because if you search google theirs very limited information out there on this topic &amp; im sure we will not be the last to do this between now &amp; the new BCH address format. 
As for Exchanges they need to step up their consumer protection Knowledge &amp; ability to help in this space to just say theirs nothing we can do to help is just unacceptable ����!
