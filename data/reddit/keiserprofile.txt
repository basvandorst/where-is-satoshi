One misunderstanding four months ago and is jumping all over him. The dude invented BitTorrent, the most widely used decentralized P2P application on the planet that has scaled up filesharing enormously. We need people like him with his to solve our scalability problems.
No wonder so much of the serious technical community stays away from Bitcoinners.
edit: A user messaged me with a correction:
'The misunderstanding was the Bitcoin community, not Bram. He was just analysing hypothetical attacks and documenting his process of learning how Bitcoin works: ["At the end of the post I propose exactly the line of code you gave, and say in the very first sentence that it may in fact already be in the codebase. I wrote this up as part of my own thought process analyzing how things work and to explain it to anyone else who might be interested."](
Just what you'd expect an expert cryptographer to do when learning something new! Take a system, see if you can break it, and come up with fixes without peeking at the answers! Impressive stuff.'

Hidden agendas and bad incentives could be the death of us.
Case in point: Sidechains.
What's the value of sidechains if Bitcoin already has the functionality you need? Those guys are starting with the best intentions I'm sure, but every feature they contribute to Bitcoin Core is a feature a sidechain now *can't* provide. Sidechains are also touted for how they can scale Bitcoin... by moving stuff onto insecure merge-mined altchains whose funds can be stolen by miners. We wouldn't need a thicket of sidechains if we just did the obvious thing and made *Bitcoin itself* scale up to its potential, as Gavin Andresen proposes in his usual down-to-earth keep-it-simple fashion.

Peter Todd has played the PR and politics game better than anyone else. Notice how it was him invited to Bitcoin Bilderberg\^H\^H\^H\^H The Satoshi Roundtable, not any of the actual Core Devs? Notice how he's hanging out with shady Bitcoin Elites at Brock Pierce's [Las Vega parties]( Notice how he's going to Barclay's sponsored "future of (fiat) banking" conferences and taking on consulting gigs with that bank and others? How he's getting away with [blackmailing Bitstamp](
Dismiss it as "Todd-truther" if you want. But Todd is a shady fucker.

Bitcoin Core developer != "Core Developer"
Patrick works on Bitcoin Core (the official name) as a developer. Peter Todd consistently tries to inflate his importance by calling himself a **Core Developer** to give the impression he's a leader in the direction of Bitcoin. That's a term that's existed for years, way before the github repo maintained by the Foundation was rebranded Bitcoin Core.

A positive amount of work would be a good start. As has said repeatedly Peter Todd's contributions are a net negative given his shit attitude. Someone who isn't a team player obviously isn't part of the Core Developer team.

Great quotes, especially on walled-gardens.
Context for those who don't hang out on IRC: Jeff Garzik has been pretty critical of Peter's approach to vulnerabilities before. He exploits them really publicly with little if any time for responsible disclosure, while simultaneously promoting his solutions. (when that "Satoshi" hacker made the invite-only bitcoin-security mailing list archives public you could even see Gavin worried about letting Peter find out about a DoS attack because he thought he'd exploit it) I'm not sure I'd call it blackmail myself, but I can see why some do.

The question is whether Peter Todd makes a living developing Bitcoin Core honestly, or trolling, and how and why he is doing that. Patrick's long ago past form the early days of Bitcoin has nothing to do with that.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:21:14
The core team of people who have contributed significantly to Bitcoin development. For all the conferences and other PR and political bullshit he spends his time on, Peter Todd does not participate actively in that process.

From the guy who was the target of that attack himself, Tom Harding:

Thank you! In a war of personalities paid trolls are the ones with the free time to win the battles against the common Bitcoiner like you and I.

"terrible ideas"
Nice way to describe work that's in part Gavin Andresen's.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:46:45
The last post of his was a nasty rant against Tom Harding/Gavin Andresen's ideas to stop double-spends.

Do we really have to keep reminding people [how incredibly little work]( Peter Todd actually does on Bitcoin Core? He writes about a dozen lines of code a **month**, almost everything being trivial changes and the odd new test. Just the other day the [Bitcoin Foundation had to remind Coindesk that he's not a core developer](

I quoted Patrick because he is the only preson I found who was willng to go on record. It's an open secret in this industry, but like most close-knit industries few people are willing to air dirty laundry.
