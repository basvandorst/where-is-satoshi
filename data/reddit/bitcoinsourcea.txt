So basically an international trade document backed escrow service?

I'm primarily a mobile (iOS/Android) and back-end web developer (Java/Ruby/Python). I do have HTML/CSS experience and some JS experience. 
I'm also moving to the Bay Area on January 6th for good. Looking for a job currently. (To support myself while i work on bitcoin related ventures every other waking hour)

Awesome, thanks! Are you a developer?

Ok I've been looking into this the past few hours. Do you think a third party escrow service would be better than the 2 factor system (BIPS38) built into Bitcoin? (see here  and 
 I'm really thinking about diving into this venture, but confused as to whether or not it is more efficient than the two implementations above based on pre-existing protocol.

Thanks solar-ice. Another question, isn't bitcoin's key feature supposed to be about not needing to trust a third party? An escrow service would take that bitcoin-specific feature away and charge a fee for it. What then would be the benefit of using bitcoin over fiat, other than the fact that its not subject to inflation?

New York. Yup, more opportunity.

That sounds like a great idea. It seems like there is a site that presents itself as a BTC escrow service (  thoughts on that? 
Also, regarding multi-sig transactions, what do you think could be one possible example of a use-case for that?
