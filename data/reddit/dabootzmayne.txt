Which is massively important, especially at this time, instability on essential tools of the market is not acceptable if you ever want to become relevant
and imo this image makes light of something that they should be taking VERY seriously

so bitcoinity is up and running for fun?

yeah obviously he can do whatever he wants and I have no issue with that.
But from a business stand-point this is a poor way to manage your entire system going offline, when you are trying to be relevant.

They are established, people know they are stable and can perform.  Is bitcoin anywhere near as established, recognized, and/or trusted?  Or these tools of bitcoin such as bitcoinity.com, are they established, where we know they're going to be back up no problem? is this a good first impression for people interested in bitcoins for the first time?

In my opinion this is terrible.  Is this really the time to put a meme/non-professional image on your emergency splash page?  When your site is trying to become an integral part of the future economy of Bitcoin.  This is your response to being completely down on most likely one of the most important days of Bitcoin?  Adding to the current panic and instability to the same market you are trying to legitimize?  Terrible.

No but the majority of the people you want to take bitcoins serious do.
