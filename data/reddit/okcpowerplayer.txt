Texas has no income tax and Alaska more or less has a negative income tax. People easily forget just how much varriance there is among states and their laws, Hell  Oklahoma didn't repeal prohibition until Sept, 1959! Oklahoma was also allowing chicken/dog fights while people were serving time for it in other states, *Cough* Michael Vic *cough*

Which one restarted the whole blockchain though? Is what I was asking about. I'm familiar with forks, but I was wondering if any had taken the code and reset the clock, so to speak.

If you value it's price it's a bad idea, but if you value utility I think it's got some benefit. More people would hold coins I'd bet and it would be a more useful p2p digital currency. Just my opinion.

I agree, he could have easily made it to where the supply was in the tens of trillions and only had it go to 3 decimal places and it would have functionally been the same. (My math might be off here, but I think the point is conveyed.) Anything more than 3 decimal places is hard for the average person to conceive of, and with out commas such a long length of decimals is almost too easy to fuck up.

I forgot about litecoin. Thanks. I feel like an idiot now.

I forgot about litecoin. Now I feel stupid. I was just thinking about all the recent forks that created new coins but still kept the chain rolling.

So you think there should be more pools? How do you think that would benefit bitcoin?

I was thinking it would be for all with FOMO. Like everyone has a chance now type of thing. No need to get anyone to switch.

What makes you think this?

It is a hassle, I agree. I think the easiest way to buy it would be to find someone to sell it to you personally. There are way to many scams out there like cashapp where you can buy it but you don't have the keys and you can't send it to a wallet that you own. I have yet to try a bitcoin atm, but I can imagine that the fees are through the roof.

I guess I just value the blockchain over bitcoin if that mmmmakes any sense. I just don't see bitcoin as fulfilling  what  it set out to do in its current iteration.

I was thinking more about the tech. Do you think the tech is lacking in any way. Is there another crypto that has features that bitcoin should Have? That would be a more concise question I should have asked.

None answer the problems with distribution, or the millions (more or less) of btc in satoshi wallet that will never get spent lowering the total supply to 20 million, which never gets talked about.

If it was adequately publicized, like one year out, I bet you could get a ton of folks mybe even with obsolete hardware to give it a shot. It would be more "fair" that way, by that I mean it would be more evenly distributed. I think the reason most people who wished they would have mined in the beginning because it's too late to get it would love a chance at getting into bitcoin. It would level the playing field in a way. Everyone now has a chance to mine the genesis block not just satoshi. Can you see why someone would want to do that? It's the ultimate  do over.

"Bitcoin like currency." I'm begining to think that the crypto to take over the world hasn't even been coded yet. I don't think bitcoin has what it takes, but I do believe some blockchain project will transform the world. There are so many things bitcoin doesn't do.

Fat Tweaker? Did she just get into the game?

People tipping leads to more use which brings us closer to mass use. Feel free to tip me out while you're at it.
