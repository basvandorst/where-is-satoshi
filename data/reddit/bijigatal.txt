Yes, plenty people want ban cigs anyway. But, if they reach their goal, can they provide millions jobs to feed tobacco farmers, cigarette factory workers, their distributors, and so on?  
Will your governments love to lose million dollars excise tax from tobacco products every year?  
I'm living in a country, where tobacco and cigarettes being our economy motors.  15% of our goverment tax income from Tobacco products excise tax. More than 7 Million people hanging on tobacco industry, from farmers to distributors.  
Actually, we don't really care about another country banned tobacco, or kretek. We just want to be tread equal like other cigarettes.

After I made good review about them. They close my account today. [**Coinbase acting like Paypal**](
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:39:29
Indonesia Goverment still fight with US regulation on court. Unfinished till now from 2009. There was a huge demand for our kreteks. But, US tobacco factory will protect their marketshares. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:43:56

watching my monitor and singing "let it gooo.. let it goo..."
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:45:54
yes, it just weird when I praised them yesterday. And suddenly they close my account xD  
It might be still thousands "Illegal goods" being sell trough coinbase. And still doing their business till now.  
    Coinbase must CLEARLY declare what can and cannot to be sell via Coinbase.  
    Coinbase staff, should know how to make differencess between "Illegal stuff" and "regulated stuff"
My bad that I talked about coinbase here. I should be keep silent.
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:25:29
I sell Kretek Cigarettes online. I thought Coinbase are welcome to tobacco products. But, they didn't even give me a valid backup reason to close my account
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:14:19

Myself smoking Black regularly . And yes, its awesome. The original ID version are 16 cigs/pack. 1.6mg Nicotine and 25mg tar.

Thank you for listing our products. List our best selling products, Djarum Black, Dji Sam Soe 234 Super Premiums, and some other high rated cigs will be apreciated.  
Awesome site for product listings. I love it
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:22:45
illegal? no it is not. It just restricted and regulated. As long as we fulfill and follow regulation, none will be arrested. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:44:54
every our customers are responsibility to tax, excise, and blah blah blah if applied.  
one of my loyal customers, from SG. Pay $ 0.78 SGD each sticks he purchase from us. They paid about $ 120 SGD each carton/shipping. And I ship 2 cartons each month to him.  
We don't offer "cheap duty free cigarettes". But we offer "genuine kretek cigarettes" and the cheap is a plus bonus :D
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:51:00
Can you help me how to add my merchant to your site and participating?
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:48:57
no we don't have it sir. We only sell cigarettes for a moment. We are specialist in Kretek Cigarettes
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:29:50
[**They send me some love letter**](  
How lovely they are
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:30:49
gonna check the out shortly. I hope they had merchant plugins for our webstore. Thank you for advices
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:46:15
Yep, even coinbase don't care giving munitions, missiles, coke, marijuana, and counterfeit banknotes that can ruin some country
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:20:10
Yes, you can buy cigarettes (any cigarettes) from internet.  
it might be Illegal to sell kreteks at US. But, Im selling my kretek from Indonesia. I'm not Murrican citizen, I dont have any physical store at US anyway. so, there's no reason US gov ask me to stop selling kreteks.  
About taxed, already described on my Terms and Agreement pages, and repeated on shipping and return. All of our customers are importer. tax, excise, and blah blah may apply. And you had to pay it! period  
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:53:13
PaPoy start to kill every tobaconists, cigs vendors, vape and juice vendors. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:20:01
I set my webstore to maintenance mode, and still working on another merchant payment gateway (not US based company) which can easy implemented plugins on my webstore.  
The most part that I was feel disapointed are, coinbase didnt write about restriction to tobacco products on their site (not anywhere). i can accept it if they already wrote it.  
Whoa... its make me headache really...
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:58:38
As long as I know. Clove cigarettes are not Illegal. But, regulated. When you import it from Indonesia, you may applied to pay excise duty, vat, and so on.  
100% successful shipment to US before. Declared or not declared, they receive their order on their hands. And, none of them being high taxed (only few bucks, vary depend states). And, most of them, are not taxed.  
*Why? That was illegal if you don't pay excise duty!*  
As long they order below 200 sticks of cigarettes are duty free. And, for personal consumption only.  
If clove cigarettes Illegal, I've been sent my customers into jail. And FBI will chasing me.  
I hope my bad engrish can be understand. Im doing this business for years. This is my first time to approach new customers and increase our sales with **Bitcoin payment gateway** that "easy implemented" on our woocommerce site.  
@_date: 2015-09-25 12:58:38
I did a mistake. read the wrong calendar xD. gonna fix that soon. thank you
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:47:01
No, I don't converting to USD fiat. My plan was re-transfer it to my bitcoin.co.id wallet and cash it out.
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:32:41
yes, we offer loyalty rewards. goin to check out your site
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:08:40
so all my US customers will go to Jail ^_^ yay...  
why customs let it go? so US customs are involved distributing illegal goods to their citizen.  
And wait, FBI knock my door :))
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:26:42
related to tobacco products, cigarettes, and specially clove cigarettes (kretek). They don't write anything about it on their ToS. Suddenly they send me a love letter.

And we all know, clove cigarettes are not "flavored cigarettes". Its Clove cigarettes. Same as menthol cigarettes (with real menthol leaves).
