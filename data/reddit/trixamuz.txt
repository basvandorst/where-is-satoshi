For those of you doing Technical Analysis. How do you come up with Bitcoin going past 20k, when the number of circulating BTC is greater now vs 2 years ago?
Volume is lower but moves much faster today than 2 years ago
BTC Dominance is at 66%~70%
The total Cryptocurrency Market Cap is 220~280 Billion
NOT ENOUGH "NEW" Buyers for bitcoin. THE SAME WHALES, INVESTORS and PEOPLE are the ones buying BTC.
Folks!!!!! Everyone needs to do their part and spread the word to everyone they know by word of mouth not just social media and internet.

I don't believe its a ponzi scheme because a ponzi scheme would actually make it ILLEGAL.....so NO. The reality is that you need new OR more money coming in to Bitcoin in order for the price to rise. The Price is determined through the exchanges so.......how else is BTC price suppose to move up? By the way just because you don't agree with FACTS that I wrote doesn't mean you have to down vote me. They say haters are gonna hate. So have a good day, you little B.

I was wondering about when the last Bitcoin will be mined and what will happen to the price. I estimate that the last bitcoin will be mined by March 2022 based off the hash rate and the amount of miners out there in world. Again!!! Its an estimate.....but anyways. To give a number of how many bitcoins will be actually still be in use I see about (+/-)\~19,500,000. The rest of the coins are either in wallets that are lost forever and no one has the keys or they are just lost in transactions. At the rate of Bitcoin being used in more and more places of business as acceptance of payment, it has made me conclude that the price of Bitcoin by April 2022 will have a slight sharp rise of about a 30%-35% within a span of just 2 weeks. Therefore causing Bitcoin to start dividing it into the decimal size. Meaning, that whoever buys anything with bitcoin at that time will only need for example 0.000000000001 BTC. It seems to me that there will be no need to transfer your money into Fiat anymore as you will be able to pay almost everything, if not everything, with BTC. Its time to start loading up NOW!!!!!!! Even if you put in only $100 every 2 weeks or whatever is it that you can put in without making a dent to your lifestyle.
My prediction........remember its just an estimated prediction based off of many factors.........
Bitcoin to be in May 2022=$72,000 USD.
What are your thoughts on the end of the last bitcoin mined and the price by that time. Please have substantiated argument or merit for your points you are making . Thank you guys and have a great day.

How was 17,000,000 BTC mined in just a decade then? and now we have only 4,000,000 to go..
120 years? I don't think so.

This guy should be partnered up with a new Crypto Coin that wants to sell make up.

Bitcoin will be a thing of the past. There is other coins which are just better than bitcoin for everything.....except for store of value, otherwise there is nothing left to it. I'm not going to mention what coins are better, I will let you do your own research and decide for yourself. RIP BTC

Well....Now you are seeing how centralized BTC is with these 2 guys causing the HASH wars. If it wasn't decentralized a few people wouldn't be able to bring the price down like its doing it. 
Forking BTC with BitcoinCash and other forks is what the federal government does with US Treasury !!!!!!Print Print Print!!!!! There is a reason why they ONLY MADE 21 Million of it.........well So much for Decentralized. First before anything else. I just wanted to say that I actually support the original idea of Bitcoin, which was a decentralized system cutting out the middle man (banks and FEDS), but crypto grew too quickly and that is no longer the case. If you still believe that after forking coins is decentralized then I guess my argument ends here.

Mining at the moment is not profitable ......so its just not feasible to be mining any coins right now. Key date to see any kind of gains this year is going to be December 18 2018. You heard it first here.    :)

First off I have been in the Crypto movement since 2011. Second I know what a fork is and I know what bitcoin is as well. There is no need for this misinformed statement. Sir I wish you a great day, take care.

The OP does bring up a good point. I have been pondering about this for 6 years. However, there is a difference in the comparison of ACTUAL gold vs bitcoin being considered digital gold, and its not that gold is physical and bitcoin is in the realm of the digitized world, NO! that's not what I'm referring to. What I mean is that gold has for not just 2 or 3 hundred  years been a standard but has been for thousands of years. Therefore gold has been proven to be a point of agreement where value is determined. Bitcoin is still in a child stage (Please DO NOT CONFUSE CHILD STAGE FOR INFANCY STAGE-WE ALREADY PASSED THAT STAGE), and as such it stills has a long way to go to get to mainstream media on a mass adoption level. Nonetheless, the cracks are starting to show for bitcoin to be in the path of  adoption in this new era we live in. At the same time other ALT coins have become much more EFFECTIVE than bitcoin for use purpose, NOT for store value or standard of measure of value in the crypto world. 
Question is:
Is bitcoin a good investment for the future?
Answer: YES
Why?: Because- As long as there is no original name to pin the creation of Bitcoin other than Satoshi Nakamoto........which we all know is just a pseudonym,  there is no-one to point the finger and say "this is a scam and biased 'Company' that created this coin to make money off of people". Bitcoin is just that, a market thrown in the wilderness to fend for itself with no bank, no institutions, no person, no nothing to be able to be the moderator of the coin. By the way, I'm fully aware of where the most hashing power and mining comes from (China). Its still technically decentralized.
