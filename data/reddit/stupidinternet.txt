And when they do the price will crash to a few cents a coin, if that.

Hey,  he wasnt just memorising any old crap,  he was memorising the very paradigm that bitcoin has disrupted. Bitcoin is clearly bullshit,  otherwise why did he spend 4 years learning the *truth*?

Buy over the space of a few days, or buy in an instant. It takes time to prepare for the auction but you are never half in your position. What do you do if you plan to buy 50k bitcoins, and after one day you have 25k and the price drops? Buy more? Or sell? What if it rises? Do you still buy 25k more? 
Seems much better being able to back out or alter your strategy right up until you make the bid, than being half way into your position with the market moving against you.

Is that the same exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection?

No offense, but are you fucking retarded? No one who has over $100m to spare is giving it to Mark Karpeles.

Bitcoiners have no cards because they are all folding.

It is true, until the 3rd decimal place, then it's not. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:35:56
Still got the same amount of bitcoins.

Will do.

Of course they haven't started raising rates. Have you noticed whenever they so much as mention they might possibly consider it in the future the markets freak out?

Stable as gold. Which moons and wanes it's fair share, but is still considered a good store of wealth by many.
