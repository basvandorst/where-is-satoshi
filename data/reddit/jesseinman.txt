My girlfriend and I sell woodblock photo prints for btc - above link includes a handful of samples. Could make a custom one for 30-40 usd or perhaps work out a deal for one of the ones we've got in stock -shipping to Spain from cali would be 40-50usd let me know if you're interested
Edit: I've got a handful of verified trades over on dogemarket as well - no scam here

Doge is up 29.64%, guess its not an alt then?

Thank you for the constructive reply - I'll e-mail Coinbase and BitPay today. To be honest, I feel stupid for not taking that avenue to start.

Thanks for the well wishes and kind words - I'm sure we've been on the 210 at the same time at some point.. only a matter of time before you see me and the btcmobile

new guy to btc here, been watching from afar for about 2 years and kicking myself in the ass daily for not buying in... people are saying the bubble is going to burst soon but i can't see how, especially now with the great day it had --
to be short, looking to purchase ~200-275 usd in btc tonight before the price climbs any more, is this something you can accomodate?

Would you be interested in contracting out work at all? I've also been looking to offer cassette mastering services and audio touchup / mastering.. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:09:43
no worries, best of luck to you in your endeavors. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:38:48
Definitely interested. Shoot me an invite when the artist slots open up.

Sorry - to be a bit more clear, the user had set up a custom plugin to accept bitcoins on bandcamp - I'm not sure that it'd make sense to contract out my payout from bandcamp in a way that delegated part of the payment to a second third party..
