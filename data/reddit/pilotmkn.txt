The dollar has lost upwards of 90+% of its purchasing power since 1913.
Tell me, oh great wise sage of the future exactly where the world will be in 5 years. Russia and China are mumbling about dumping the dollar. Asia is on the rise. You or I have no clue about the next 5 years. I am lening against it

5-20 years sure.

You're a good serf. Master will reward you.

Obsolete and worthless are two different things. The dollar will still be around, it will just be worth even less than it is now.

The whole point of Bitcoin is there is no central planning. That's a dumb question to ask. You might as well ask a vegan his favorite hamburger recipe.

Sorry, I guess the proper response was to get on our knees and start sucking

The IRS doesn't have the time or resources to go after your $300 bitcoin gain, cowards. You're just tossing your own money down the drain.
@_date: 2014-07-18 02:26:36
Fuck you and your regulations.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:28:54


YES! Bitcoin doesn't need compromise. Its working fine.

You know how I paid my bitcoin taxes? I didnt, because I dont owe those vultures at the IRS a god damned cent.

No, it reflects the community perfect: fuck government, bitcoin is working fine without them. "Fuck Off" is the exact draft change I would propose.
You wanna be like the taxi companies getting their asses handed to them like Uber and Lyft? Keep going. They decided to "draft changes" and embrace their masters and now they are bloated, regulated dinosaurs whose days are numbered.

The government tried for years to invent a working airplane. They spent tens of thousands of dollars trying.
Two guys in a bicycle shop did it in their spare time.
Fun Fact:  Until after WWII, the Smithsonian Institute refused to credit the Wright Bros. with inventing the airplane because the curator had been one of those failed government airplane inventors. 
The Wright Flyer wasn't even on display in the United States, the Wright Bros. sent it overseas to be displayed in a European museum. We're lucky it survived the war.

So, things aren't legitimate unless they help the state rob people basically? I suppose marijuana is also not legit unless they tax it too right?

har har. Until they send in the cops and haul me off to be put in a cage.

So let's give those same evil humans a giant organization with perceived authority and a monopoly on the use of violence to regulate society. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:20:59
That is a serious argument.
You're sitting here trying to say something akin to "Marconi invented the radio, therefore Marconi invented the cell phone!"
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:43:24
The government didn't invent the internet, it strung some cables between a few computers, as if free individuals wouldn't have figured that out on their own.
Entrepreneurs and the market invented the internet and made it what it is. Your argument is like saying that Marconi invented cell phones.
I suggest you Google the governments efforts at inventing the first airplane. All their efforts failed and they were spanked by a couple of amateurs in a bicycle shop.

Be a good citizen and give your wallet to the mugger

That's not true in all situations.
I had a friend who pulled into a Taco Bell parking lot, put his keys in the glovebox and laid down in the back seat of his car and got charged with a DUI.
Stuff like that is absurd in my eyes and shouldn't be considered drunk driving.
