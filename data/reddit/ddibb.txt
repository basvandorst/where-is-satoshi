Interesting. I didn’t know this was possible to generate a seed for use in electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:29
As with any browser generator, I’d only use addresses generated from the site running locally on an offline system. In that case, I don’t think there is any risk of the keys being stored...but what I would be concerned about is the validity of the generated keys or if they are predetermined in some way.

If I encrypt a wallet on one device, is the same wallet encrypted on another device, or is the encryption independent and local- meaning if the wallet is encrypted on one device, someone could still send coins on the other with no password?

Maybe it would make more sense if it wasn't for the comma
Edit: nope

There're both there. That repo was forked from the original and I think a few things were added, like the option to output compressed keys.
I still haven't really checked it out to make sure nothing malicious is happening (like it sending out the private keys it finds), but there are a lot of people on GitHub, so someone probably would have said something if it was messed up.
The original is here:
What system are you going to build it on? Let me know if you have issues. I now know how to compile it on the OS X and Windows. Often, building something like this doesn't go smoothly—especially on Windows, so it could help to have someone to ask about it.

That's vanitygen. I'm using oclvanitygen, which is about 15 times faster on my hardware because the calculations it's doing run much faster on a GPU. That's why people used to use GPUs to mine BTC and some still do (but a lot use special hardware similar to graphics processors).
When I was using vanitygen, I was getting 1.7 Mkey/s. With my GPU, I get about 26 Mkey/s—and that's only using one of my two GPUs. This brings me from reaching 50% probability in about 260 days to around 16 days. 8 days if I use both GPUs.
Both vanitygen and oclvanitygen are included in that repo. Oclvanitygen runs on your GPU using OpenCL.

Third the good one :D :D :D
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:52:37
Thanks. It's a desktop wallet.
It's not offline. Why wouldn't I want to share a wallet between multiple devices? Any transaction I make on one will show on the other. I have it on my laptop so I can use it when I'm not able to get to my desktop machine.
@_date: 2014-05-31 09:57:05
Like I said, it doesn't make sense
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:45:05
Interesting points, but the lack of commas made it harder to read than it needed to be.
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:17:33
Thanks for bearing with me. They were both using the same addresses, so if anyone sent me anything, I'd still get it. I'd be extremely surprised if anyone sent me anything at this point, anyway.
I've read up about change addresses and really appreciate you giving me the correct info.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:49:54
Yes. It's a desktop wallet-qt. You confirmed what I was thinking. Thanks.

"The Massachusetts Division of Banks" is reviewing whether the ATM needs licensing". I wonder what their decision will be on that one. /s Why does this division have the authority to decide if it needs licensing?

I'm just gonna delete the wallet on the laptop. Armory seems pretty cool. I'm gonna install it now.
One question about armory: is it secure? I don't want it to have to pass my data over a network.
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:51:57
I booted into windows and after about an hour of downloading different versions, dependencies for the uncompiled versions, etc., I started getting the dreaded "CPU hash GPU hash" output. At least it was working...at 24 Mkey/s! And that's only 1 GPU! A lot better than 1.71 on the CPU.
I downloaded the latest windows x86+x64 binaries from en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vanitygen. At first, I has the same CPU Hash GPU Hash problem, but when I updated the AMD drivers to the latest recommended with the AMD Driver Autodetect app (catalyst 14.4), I ran it and got my first address!
I just figured I'd leave this here in case it helps someone else having similar issues.
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:50:12
Thanks for the response.
So, my paper backup doesn't hold the imported keys even after I import them?
I need to keep the paper backup and also hold on to the private key as a backup of the one I import? Any difference if I just use that to accept payments and sweep those into another address that's part of the original armory wallet?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:46:14
Why can't I just delete the old wallet on the laptop I'm not using and only use the desktop?
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:35:39
Thanks for the link. It seems the issues with AMD are known. I'll check this out when I have some time.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:02:37
Good point. So, before, I sent .01 to myself to test like you suggested. Could I now see messed up things happening in the future because of different change addresses?
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:59:04
The difference between the percentage increases/reductions you're giving as examples mean nothing — they're based on different values. In order to be back where you were and not be at a loss, it needs to gain exactly the same value as it has lost.
Edit: and on top of that, in my experience, bitcoin often gains value much more rapidly than it loses

Until the dollar is worth next to nothing due to hyperinflation
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:32:44
Everything's up to date, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Apple has updated the graphics drivers to where they should be.
I'll definitely try sudo when I have a minute and report back. While looking into this more last night, I came across others having the same issue. It seems this may just be an issue with oclvanitygen:
I might boot into windows and try it over there.
Edit: typos
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:35:44
Yep, the public address shown in armory as a confirmation is an exact match. I've tried a couple different formats for the private keys—at least the ones armory accepts. Bitaddress is actually what I'm using to decrypt the bip-38.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:15:05
It turns out, one transaction went through so far even after the transactions completely disappeared from blockchain.info and Armory removed the transaction from my history. The fact that this can happen is not very reassuring.
@_date: 2016-06-22 04:42:50
Yep. I actually have only typed it in manually (or copied from bitaddress so far). If I still can't do it tomorrow, I'll probably try your phone suggestion or omniwallet. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:52:54
Thanks for the info.
Earlier, when I tried to sweep the private keys, it said there were no funds available to sweep. This was before the transaction went missing from blockchain.info. I will try resetting the wallet cache in a bit.
If this is not confirmed now, how do I know it will not be confirmed later? [Here]( is another post where someone had a similar issue, and all those transactions seem to have eventually completed.
Someone else in this thread is asking for the txid. Is this safe to give out?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:10:08
Thanks. Yeah. That seems to be the issue with those transactions, but it still confuses me why the transaction disappeared (could not longer find it using the txid or address) and then eventually processed.
My main concern now is trying to understand why the uncompressed key is not showing the result as the compressed—they're both taken from the same encrypted private key.
Thanks for taking the time to help.
Oh, and armory allows you to set the tx fee when you send the funds.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:39:05
Thanks for the info. I'm sure that site will come in handy...but I included a 0.0002 fee with my last attempt. It never made it into the chain.

That one I just sent a couple minutes ago with a very small fee. I didn't include a fee for the previous one. Is there any way to definitively conclude that the previous transaction will never process?
Also, with the fees, do you know a good general rule for the amount of fee to include? It seems strange that it is essentially required for a transaction to be processed. I was under the impression that fees would get it picked up faster, but are not required. What happens when Bitcoin is worth a lot more...with a value like $10,000 per? If I buy a taco somewhere, am I going to have to include a fee for a $3 transaction? With value like that, there are going to be a lot of leading zeros for any reasonable fee. From
what I remember, the Bitcoin core client won't even allow fees under a few decimal places.
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:11:12
Do you know a way to get a transaction ID from Armory after it was removed from the transactions list? If not, the only ones I have are the one from yesterday, 8a991a4faa7c3ad9b3b9580ea84e4eb648cb8eb1be83332e56208ad97d9e3523 and the currently unconfirmed one I posted above. They were automatically removed from Armory very quickly.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:34:55
Does that really seem like what I wrote? I was descriptive as possible without writing the exact message verbatim. The lack of any errors is part of the reason I have no idea what I can do to resolve this. The only messages I got were something to the effect of, "there doesn't appear to be any funds to sweep" in armory and "No Inputs found. (Note that inputs need to be confirmed)", in electrum—which I thought were covered by me saying the clients cannot find any funds for the address when there are 75 confirmations. I'm a developer for a living and understand the importance of providing a detailed description of the issue.
Previous posts are [here]( and [here]( where I explained the issues in detail.
I just tried the compressed private key, and the funds showed. I don't understand why the uncompressed private key from the same BIP-38 key isn't showing any funds.
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:41:40
Thanks to whoever downvotes these questions asking for help. I don't care about karma, but I do care about getting some help and helping others who might have a problem and search for something like this in the future. With the problems I've had with Bitcoin over the last couple days, I am seriously discouraged from even wanting to continue with it, and I'm technically inclined. Some in this community have been very helpful, but you'd think it would make sense to offer some help to those with issues instead if preventing it so we can grow the community instead of shutting people down /out.

So they err on the side of freezing a customer’s account? If they’re not certain on the legality, they should look into it and wait to take any action until they find an answer. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to overlook this and would be closing my account as soon as possible—taking my complaint up the chain as far as it can go in the meantime.
It is absolutely wrong of them to freeze a customer’s account without any valid reason, and they should be held accountable.

I purchased a few days ago. It gave me a four day delay when I used to be able to purchase instantly. Now I'm seeing the hold increase to 6 days. It's good to know others are experiencing this as well and it's not just me..

We know this is not a coinbase support forum, but there was no info on this in their support forum and there is no reason why we shouldn't help each other out with info here.
