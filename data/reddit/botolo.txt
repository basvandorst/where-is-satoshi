Here is one thing I don’t understand yet. If the transactions in LN are off-chain and they are added to the blockchain only when I close a channel, how do I avoid double spending?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:17:56
Oh maybe this is why!
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:22:52
Similar concern and also (no flame intended) has Bitcoin Cash solved the same problem by just increasing the block size?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:26:45
It also has USB. It was the only one available and it was pretty cheap. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:08:20
How did they seize the BTC? Did he give them the private key of the wallet(s)?
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:45:55
But the problem is if I double spend what I transferred to the script-controlled address.
Example: I open a channel with 1 BTC. Now the 1 BTC is locked into the channel and I can't use that 1 BTC for a different on-chain transaction.
Now I can use my 1 BTC on the LN to do other transactions. For example, I can send 0.5 BTC on the LN to Adam and 0.5 BTC on the LN to Bob. But if I understand correctly, these two transactions are not registered on-chain until I close the channel. Can I trick the LN to allow me to send the same 0.5 BTC I sent to Adam to someone else as well?
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:55:24
Question: I just got an external HDD to create my Bitcoin Core node (I don’t have enough space on my laptop). 
If the wallet and Bitcoin Core files reside on the HDD (and the app resides on my laptop), does it mean that I can take the HDD to my office during the day, connect it to a different Mac, and keep on running the same node?

I wonder if Coinbase is still the most secure place to store your bitcoins. Two factor authentication with Google Authenticator, Vault for Bitcoin and Ethereum, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:13:30
My thinking is that Coinbase has two-factor authentication that works with Google Authenticator. They also have the Vault system, where I get notified if someone tries to move my BTC. They are also a fully insured company (in case a MtGox thing happens).
Electrum can be hacked (see recent issue) and if this happens, I can't sue the developer to get my money back.

@_date: 2018-01-06 17:03:15
Thank you. The document would then be stored on Storj and the transaction would have the hash and location, correct? Is there a way to store a document on Storj and make it available to everyone?
For example, the public administration could digitalize all of their documents, store them on Storj, store their hash and location on a Bitcoin or Ethereum transaction and this would allow them to migrate everything "in the cloud" to a decentralized network. Would this work?
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:28:53
One thing I don’t understand. Isn’t the scaling issue related more to the block size and time between blocks? If that’s the case, how can faster processors help this?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:39:07
Using an example, this means that I could open a channel with my local coffee place and then use LN transactions every time I buy a coffee? If this is the case, I have two questions:
* does it mean that in order to open the channel I need to create a bitcoin transaction for a total amount I intend to spend on coffees for a while?
* does it mean that until the LN channel is closed both the coffee place and myself are not 100% sure that the LN transactions will be confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:32:09
After listening to a recent episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin with Andreas, I decided to give Segwit a try. I installed Electrum, and created a Segwit wallet. I then checked the balance on some online platforms such as Blockchain.info and realized that they don’t display Segwit wallets. 
This scared me a little bit. If I move my BTC to my Electrum Segwit wallet, am I sure that I will be able to use them in the future if no online platform will adopt Segwit?

This is a great post, thanks for sharing. I will start learning more about the Lightning Network and I will do some alpha-testing on testnet. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:42:44
WOW, the currently suggested transaction fee is at 566 Satoshis = $77.57. Crazy!
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:20:57
Ops another question. Would it be possible to add one of the ideas behind the Lightning network to the idea of bigger block size?
We could increase block size to allow more transactions, less fees and faster confirmation.
We could also adopt the concept of "trusted agreement" of Lightning Network to crystallize all transactions on the blockchain up to a certain point and then stop including in each node the section of the blockchain before the crystallization. For example, if there is anonymous consense that transactions before date X are correct, there would be no need to continue adding those transactions to the blockchain downloaded by each node.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:18:03
Very interesting, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:20:28
I have read the Lightning Network whitepaper and I have a question. This is a sincere question, not a flame attempt: wouldn't' it be easier to just increase the block size to avoid high fees and long confirmation times?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:53:39
It's now at $88!

I don’t consider hodling adoption mainly because most of the people who hodl do this only in the hope of BTC price going up. But the price will go up and stay up only if BTC is useful (i.e. if people use it to buy stuff or if we find another useful way to use the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:20
Interesting. This means that as of today BTC makes sense just to move fairly large amount of money. No use for small transactions, smart contracts (that usually operate with small transactions) etc? Did Satoshi predict this issue?
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:43:08
I have a question with reference to this passage of his post.


Is this still the case with the current Bitcoin protocol? I thought that Bitcoin addresses had private and public keys, not the single coins.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:52:53
This thing and also the fact that you can send money to anyone via email, also through Google Wallet, make bitcoin more and more useless.
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:46:34
I see...I was looking at something in the blockchain. So for example all the colored coins are using the blockchain and their own database to track the coins...they are not adding some value in the transaction itself?

According to Techcrunch, they stole 88,000 bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:23:23
I think the article seems to be pretty legit but there is something that makes me question it. Why did they publish the picture of the house of Nakamoto? This piece of information is not relevant at all...you have already said where he lives and you don't need to exactly pinpoint people to his house.
Unless, you want to make it clear that this person is now in danger, because everyone now knows where he lives.
What if this article is just a bait to see whether the real Satoshi Nakamoto will come out, to defend the Nakamoto from the article?
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:26:29
Interesting, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:51:14
It is a private company that is providing this service. They should be the ones verifying the accounts. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:20:53
They could use the same "verification" model used by Twitter. When the user is somehow popular, you should send bitcoins only if that's a verified account.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:57:57

What I am saying is that people don't care about bitcoin anymore. It keeps on being a very very niche thing, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:33:22
Let's remember the full quote, which now we can assume is right:
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:05:16
Question: let's assume that there is a way we can, without any doubt, say that those addresses are property of GOX and let's also assume that GOX lost their private key.
Is there any technical way, including changing the way the bitcoin protocol currently works (maybe the developers would be interested in helping all of GOX's users to get their bitcoins back) to recover those keys or create new ones?
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:21:57
And this long silence would explain this...
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:52:04
Fantastic idea, bring it to Los Angeles, please!
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:17:02
This bitcoin world seems to be filled with businesses that are far from being serious. Mt. Gox first, Butterfly Labs, now Robocoin. Come on, guys, put you shit together.
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:14:12
And so a serious coin should keep on switching PoW to face this problem. For example, from SHA256 bitcoin could have switched to Scrypt and then to Scrypt-N.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:53:09
I agree with you but this would require a lot of work, a lot of verification, etc. The idea of restoring GOX's keys or just giving them the opportunity to repossess those BTC would be slightly different, it's a case of lost keyword.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:30:15
This is interesting. If this circumstance is confirmed (the loss of keys), we are basically talking about millions of dollars in BTC owned by many many users that are just there. This would not be recovering stolen property or helping fraud. I would support this.
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:34:49
Oh sorry! I just found it out a week ago when I went there and I saw the "Bitcoin accepted" sign. I did not read about it here and I thought it was something new.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:49:43
I totally agree with you. Also, if someone steals my debit card, I can contest the charges and the bank will give my money back in 24 hours. This bitcoin debit card is linked to my wallet. What's going to happen if someone steals it? Who is going to give me my money back?
@_date: 2015-05-26 01:11:37
If I understand correctly, Ver digitally signed V7 while V8 does not have a digital signature. If this is the case, this is far from saying that the lack of digital signature on V8 proves that Ver never signed that contract. First of all, digital signature is not a requirement for contract formation. Second, the second contract seems an amendment to the previous contract and amendments are usually regulated by the original contract and by applicable law. Do we have a copy of the contract? Do we know which law applies to the contract? Do we know whether the original contract (v7) allowed for amendments? Do we know which form requirements the amendment had to comply with according to the contract?
Edit: I just checked the contracts. No forum selection clause. No choice of law. Oh my god, if this contract goes to court, it will be litigated forever.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:25:40
I totally agree with you. Bitcoin just proved that it's not ready for mass adoption and that it's still just a game. I am sure that crypto currencies will be the future but today we realized that it's just too soon. 
Imagine is bitcoin was already massively adopted. Just one DDOS attack and all the exchanges stopped withdrawals for several days. Crazy!
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:07:32

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:51:50
I am confused. If they do a hard fork, what will the BTC I already have be called? Will they live on the BTC side or the BTU side?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:37:58
Do I understand correctly that if ABC's height goes over 478558, the fork you have would be meaningless in term of health of the main chain? The main chain is currently almost 10 blocks beyond 478558 and would reject block 478559 mines by ABC. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:05:29
Is there anyone out there providing a recovery service for this kind of problems and being honest enough to not steal the BTC if they are found?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:51:04
This is weird. Small number of transactions and blocks almost full?!! Also, unconfirmed transactions are growing. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:58:21
But at that point who cares about the main blockchain? Wouldn’t this be a failure of Satoshi’s project? We are basically saying that this project can’t scale and we need another project on top of that to scale. And what happens when the LN is full of transactions? Will we need another project on top of LN?
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:47:51
Thanks! I’ll give it a try.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:44:57
Technically speaking, how did you pay? Did you do a BTC transaction or Lightning Network? Which wallet did you and the store use? Did the store make you wait few confirmations? How much were the transaction fees?
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:10:33
I agree that this is the ultimate goal. But we are still far away from it. Nowadays if you want to use Bitcoins you need to buy them from one of the many online platforms (which means registering an account with them and it means that some of them will also monitor your transactions).
Sure, I can buy Bitcoins from a stranger with cash using localbitcoins (is this still a thing) or from an ATM (which, by the way, will most likely ask me for a phone number or ID) but I will pay a pretty hefty extra on the exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:46:22
Mmmm, he sold that company a looooong time ago. I am pretty sure the whole code is different now.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:43:25
Got it but do they cost fees? If so how can we make sure that once there will be tons of txs we are not going to have the same problem of high fees?
@_date: 2019-04-29 03:39:45
I truly wonder if the numbers of lost bitcoins is accurate. Also, what should we do if we realize millions of BTC are lost forever?? Should we hard fork and put these BTC back in the market?
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:35:55
I tried it today. It requires you to create a coinme account and you need to provide your ID.
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:05:40
Should we remember that each BTC Tx has fees as well?
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:34:27
That’s fine but then you’re building a system for a small number of people and it will never become mainstream. And hopefully those developing countries will get better through the years and their need for Bitcoin will become thinner and thinner. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:52:04
Let’s think about the average joe. Why should he switch to Bitcoin?
He can easily pay merchants online using his debit or credit card. Payment goes through instantly and joe does not pay any additional fee. He can also do the same with his phone using Apple Pay, AliPay, WeChat, etc (depending on location).
He can easily transfer money to friends instantly using Venmo, Zelle, etc. And if he receives money this way, he can transfer the money to the bank account almost instantly using the same tools. 
What’s the benefit of using Bitcoin? Serious question. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 01:32:20
Mmm can someone explain what's the purpose of these auctions? I have read the info page on the gemini website, but I still don't get it. Why people should buy BTC using the auction instead of buying them on Coinbase or other exchange platforms?
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:43:15
I totally agree with you. Is there any other place where people can talk about Bitcoin’s development, use, etc? Even bitcointalk is now a pretty bad place to have good discussions. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:59:07
how expensive would it be considering the use of the minimum transfer possible?
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:44:36
I am sure you are right. It would have been fun to see whether he was storing them somewhere specific. For example, think about seeing that those 66,000 BTC are stored on an iPhone wallet app! That would be like: this guys have square balls!
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:41:25
Because they think WBA is the creator of Bitcoin and that, therefore, it's Bitcoin going bankrupt

They have now moved the article at the bottom of their home page  they have changed its title to "USA corporation operating with Bitcoins filed for controlled bankruptcy" and they link, right after the title, another article titled "Bankitalia suggests to avoid using and buying the virtual currency". From inside the leading article, they say: "A US company that uses bitcoins, the virtual currency, has filed for controlled bankruptcy, submitting its corporation books to the bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The company has $300,000 in debts. This is one of the first signs of a likely broader crisis of the virtual currency". OMG! They tried to fix this and they made it worse.
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:01:30
I agree that Bitcoin could become the leading blockchain and then other solutions could just be sidechains. At the end of the day, correct me if I'm wrong, I think Bitcoin is the one that has the biggest and more stable network of nodes and miners. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:31:46
Nice article. I would like to know more about your lifestyle. Also, I share your frustration towards people interested in Bitcon et al. for the only purpose of becoming rich fast. I have to say that I feel a similar frustration. I love love love Bitcoin and I would love to be an active part of the network. I can't code and in the past I did mining mostly to support the network and help process transactions. But nowadays with all those crazy miners with thousands of dollars of equipment, I can't even do that :-(
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:29:45
Here is what I don't understand. If the core Bitcoin client and the cgminer app or whatever miners use are not changed in the code, how can the fact that I signal something affect the way the Bitcoin network works?!?
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:57:44
How did they do this? How were they able to create a Bitcoin address with the "fucku" text?
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:35:49
I care about BCC if they gain value. I would hate to miss the opportunity to make some money. What is the purest bitcoin wallet solution that does not require installation of the core software, download of GBs of data, etc?
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:30:01
Do we have anything in the original white paper or in any of his forum posts that might suggest what Satoshi Nakamoto would have thought about this issue?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:45:40
But then how do I sent the BTC back to Coinbase once the craziness is done?
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:38:02
I don't understand. You showed how someone could send me money in my Google Wallet using BTC. If the final goal is to allow users to send me money instantly, why can't I just do it by having someone sending me money through their Google Wallet? What's the purpose of using BTC?
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:51:37
Can you expand on this a little bit? My concern is the following: let's say our client clicks on the banner, goes on the landing page and decides to subscribe to our services. He then puts his mobile number on a form, click the "subscribe" button and he is shown a QR code of our Bitcoin address. How can he then send BTC to this address, given that he can't scan that QR code with his phone (because the QR code itself is already on his screen)?
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:40:32
It's still too complex. We have to make Bitcoin much much easier to use. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:05:43
Wait. This is super interesting. Can you explain a little bit more?
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:32:10

@_date: 2019-05-05 16:44:49
Thanks a lot to you and all the other friends who posted their very helpful comments here. One more question. I now understand that the likelihood of generating a duplicate seed is minuscule and that the seed combinations are soooo many. But here is a thing I don’t understand: these comments seem to start from the idea that you have a system with 0 seeds ever created and then you launch your software to generate 2 seeds and, as you say, the likelihood of the software giving you two identical seeds is basically impossible. But the more seeds are created, the more and more likely it is that the system might generate a duplicate seed. Using a practical example, it’s like having two bowls with numbered balls and each bowls containing a great number of balls. If I start the game and ask you to pick one ball out of each bowl, it’s very unlikely you’ll pick the same ball. But if I have played this game millions of times with other people, that means that you might pick a ball that was already picked in the previous millions of times. And the problem is that once the same ball is picked, all the money a user had is gone forever.

@_date: 2019-05-08 02:22:06
What tells us that this was a hack? I am not doubting it, but I was just wondering if something in the transaction tells us this is more than a transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:23:32
Please ping me via DM once you’re done! I’d love to try it. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:32:41
I think they are still looking for people to hire. I don't think they have made any decision yet. Jack Dorsey, Square CEO, is very supportive of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:30:31
Do we know whether he kept the BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:39:41
Good for you! I am still a believer. What’s the best way to see real adoption in the world? I’d love to see a list or a map of online and offline stores accepting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:57:01
Mmmm, this would be too complex. Then he has to open his BTC app or wallet, copy and past the address, then come back to our landing page...nobody would signup, unfortunately. Too many barriers. Any other idea?

What's going to happen to mining? Will people stop mining, then difficulty go down?
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:17:09
I am a tech geek and so I love all the technical details such as the mining aspect of it, the facts that it's a peer to peer network with no banks of other parties involved, etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:46:10
My question was different. I was wondering what would be a fun way to mine. From what Jeff_R says, this kind of ASIC miners are not fun because you just plug them in and forget about them. Is there any other hardware for mining which is funnier and more interesting?

Oh no, I heard about him some time ago but I was not sure who he was. I did not know he passed away. When I finished reading the article I thought "wow great guy, I hope he will have more years to enjoy his life". Pretty sad to come back to the comments and realize he died already.

Wow so this is a Mac related problem. I hope they will fix it!
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:11:46
I would be interested in seeing how many BTC have not moved for a very long time. That might suggest BTC owned by early adopters who lost keys, hard drives, etc. Basically lost coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:32:26
The problem is that Multibit is not secure as Bitcoin-QT.
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:23:49
So, what would be fun instead? GPU?
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:30:45
I know this guy was up to something ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:17:18
I am just concerned that other wallets are not as secure as the official client. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:53:38
What I currently like are the Asicminer USB dongles. They are cheap, you can use more than one and you can build your little farm and add a USB fan to cool everything down. It's kind of playing with Lego again :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:17:36
I have 8 connection and cable internet, pretty fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:24:28
Is there any other good miner products which make sense or mining does not currently make sense at all?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:31:12
196299 blocks synced. It says that the last block was received 65 weeks ago :-(
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:44:43
From here  you can see that Multibit has a partial network security, while Bitcoin-QT has a full network security. I think the issue is that Multibit still has to go through the Multibit servers to check the integrity of the blockchain and if someone alters Multibit's servers, your security may be jeopardized.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:32:26
What I am saying is that I would love to be part of this new currency but the only way I can get some bitcoins and use them is to (i) mine (but we know it is not profitable anymore) or (ii) buy bitcoins on the trade market but the current fluctuation does make me think this does not make sense...what if I buy a bitcoin today for $380 and tomorrow it will crash down to $100
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:29:58
Of course I support and I buy and use bitcoins but I also try to figure out what the future will be and if we can in some way understand the limits and find how to go beyond them. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:46:42
Nice car my friend! I keep on dreaming to do the same, while my iMac works mining 0.00002645 BTC :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:32:09
Credit card companies would still be there. Their role is to give credit and even with bitcoins you'll have plenty of people looking for credit and spend money they don't have. 
Also, while you can transfer money without the need of a plastic card, you are still transferring money from a non perfectly secure wallet to another non perfectly secure wallet. There will be a time when apps will come, giving you the security you need with your wallet and they will charge you a fee.

I have been reading for quite a while but I myself can't come with an answer. Thing about real life examples:
- I need to pay for something. I use my debit or credit card or even the iPhone (see starbucks) and money is withdrawn automatically from my bank account with no additional fees for me. What's the benefit of using bitcoins here?
- I need to send money to a friend quickly. I send the money to his paypal account or I just pay him using square. What's the benefit of using bitcoins here? Maybe just the absence of fee? But in a small amount like the one I would send using paypal the fees are super low. 
- I need to send a large amount to someone. I send a wire transfer and it arrives in a day or a little bit more (if I send it in another country). What's the benefit here? Speed and absence of fees. But fees for a wire are low $35 for a wire to another country with BOfA, which I am happy to pay to use a system which is guaranteed. The speed may be an issue but with bitcoins going mainstream I wonder what will be the speed of verification of transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:28:39
Because the fees tells the miner how fast it should include the transaction in a block. More transactions, more competition to have your transaction included in a block before the others and get certification fast. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:34:22
how does it work?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:29:39
WOW thanks a lot for the tip!
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:35:04
ah cool, thanks! I thought I was witnessing the 51% attack! Also, block 271360 is not chronologically ordered correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:50:07
Thanks a lot!!!!!!!! :-D
