Labelling something as GMO just implies that there's something wrong with that. If you want GMO labelling, just label the *non* GMO food. Don't force the rest of the world to label their GMO food. That's ridiculous and stupid.

The way Bitcoin works is that it makes all this information public, only pseudonymous. If Coinbase, for instance, reveals where transactions were sent, it's very easy for the government to look at that and figure out which addresses belong to whom. Both wire transfers and bitcoin are weak in this aspect, if one wants to protect the privacy of their transactions, the apparent solutions seem to reside in Dash and Monero. I hear that the Bitcoin Cash fork is introducing some level of privacy protection, but I do not know how it works. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:39:14

If I were sending it to a rich country like Japan or South Korea, it might not be a big deal. If I were doing business with someone in Pakistan, Somalia, or Sierra Leone, if they wanted to send me money they might not be able to afford the tx fees. Bitcoin does not seem to be in a position to help the under-banked.

@_date: 2018-01-31 18:52:41
But you're still running the gauntlet whenever you make a transaction as to whether or not the other party to the transaction is a fed or not. All it takes is one and bam, there's a pretty solid picture of your transaction history. It's not a very private system, but when transactions are a few pennies it's easily remedied by coin mixing services. When transaction fees are not only a few pennies, the cost of privacy becomes unbearable.

So? If they see a 100 dollar bitcoin acquisition on Coinbase, then see all of it going to one account, then it's pretty obvious that the account is his main address. You could do it in 12 different transactions, or send bits of it to different addresses, but that increases the price of withdrawal by quite a staggering degree. 
The cheapest way to increase the privacy of your bitcoin involves going to shapeshift or something, selling all your bitcoin for monero, then selling all that monero for bitcoin again, depositing it into a new bitcoin address when doing so. This isn't fool-proof, mind you, and opens you to extra risk (price fluctuations, for instance). 


That's not a large enough selling point on it's own. Most (all?) cryptocurrencies have this as a feature. Besides, if they know *who* you are, then they can just perform some quick rubber-hose crypto-analysis to get at your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:34:48
I don't think that this will kill cryptocurrencies. I think this will become an obstacle to mainstream adoption. This means that all the wonderful benefits of an economy that's primarily based on crypto will be delayed .

So you call me poor, and you say you're not bashing me. Listen, buster, I've been doing bitcoin since it was less than a hundred bucks, and I have a lot of it, and I'm just starting to get it out of cold storage. 


No, fuck that. You're trying to get people who do not like the bitcoin network shitty to stop using bitcoin so you can keep the bitcoin network shitty. You should form your own altcoin if you want to make a coin that's all about slow transaction speeds at high prices.

I just bought a 4 terabyte hard drive for less than a hundred bucks.  For the cost of 2 bitcoin transaction fees, you could also have a hard drive that could hold the entire blockchain.
Should blocks be unlimited in size? Maybe not. It should be larger. It should be way larger. Block size limits were only introduced as a temporary measure, and after literally years of bickering, the block size is the same even though it's obvious, yes, obvious that it's too small. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:28
So? In the future we'll still need bigger blocks, so there's no real problem in implementing larger blocks now, and implementing lightning or whatever when we know it works well.

Are you fucking joking? "Oh, hurr de hurr, moneygram costs a lot of money!"
Moneygram and WU are fucking ancient institutions that we used to brag about destroying. There was a graphic a couple years back that showed the benefit of Bitcoin as being "Send money world wide for less than a penny." If it seriously starts looking better to western union money to fucking Zaire, then Bitcoin is in deep shit, and that's a fact.
That's gone. 
Yeah, I'm going to bitch about transaction fees. If you don't like me bitching about *obscenely high tx fees* then block me or don't visit a subreddit for the discussion of Bitcoin when Bitcoin is currently suffering from *absurdly high transaction fees*.

Basically, if you send bitcoin from one wallet to another, you could get charged with money laundering. Looking at blockchain.info might put you in a supervisory role and get you 5 years for supervising illegal transactions. The bill is full of terrible ideas that would seriously hamper your use of crypto, and make it pretty much unusable in any legal sense. Bitcoin adoption would drop like a brick as people are charged for violating this bill.

Okay, so have the block size increase an agreed upon amount every so-many blocks. Every 4 years, double it's size. If it seems like it's going too quick, quadruple it. Not using up blocks enough? NBD, the only point of having one in the first place is to prevent spam, so if they're not being filled up there's still no problem in increasing it.

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:43:58
They'll go down and then Bitcoin will also go down, so the only smart thing to do is to bite the bullet and pay the fees if you want to cash them out, at least that's how it looks from my perspective. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:11

I think the lightning network isn't showing up. 
Also, if I have to re-send my bitcoin to another account,a fter already having to send it to a segwit wallet, (and and STILL suffering from 10 dollar tx fees using segwit, what the hell?), I'm not entirely convinced Lightning will make it better. 
It just adds an additional layer of confusion. This is already more complicated than it was, as an old fart, this looks to me that bitcoin is just slow as fuck and not capable of dealing with large amounts of use. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:25

The TX fees are 10 dollars *WITH SEGWIT*. 
That's absolutely crazy. That's a hundred thousand times higher than what it should be. Why should they use Segwit when Segwit doesn't actually lower transaction fees to any significant degree? 
10 dollars is too much for this. This is stupid.

Well, then change bitcoin. Why should I be in support of people with your bad opinions ruining something I love? I've been doing crypto for years, and Bitcoinw was my first horse, I'm not sacrificing it to it's enemies just because they say that it's not for me. You're not for bitcoin. You're for gold. Go invest in gold, get out of crypto.


 I've been doing this for years, this is way more volatile than normal. I don't care about volatility that much, but if you're going to pretend that the price swings are in any way dampened by high tx fees then you're simply incorrect. 


Yeah. Why is my opinion less valid than yours? Who are you to say that it should be like Gold when it was never supposed to be like gold? You're the one who is trying to change bitcoin, not me. If you honestly think that it would be better for the world to be more expensive, then you might as well use fiat, pay your taxes, and donate money to the Social Security Administration, because Bitcoin isn't for you.

I don't need gold. I already have gold. There's no point in money being on the internet, being made of electrons that can go real quick-like across the world, if bitcoin is just going to emulate a precious metal that can't. 


I don't think so, we're seeing ridiculous fees and ridiculous volatility. We have massive 5000 dollar price swings and ridiculous transaction fees, this statement appears to be false. 


Yeah, but I would prefer not selling all of my Bitcoin in order to switch to them, but it's starting to appear that the enemies of bitcoin have successfully taken it over. I want to be able to send money from the US to Thailand in seconds, and have it cost next to nothing. That's the role Bitcoin should have.

Please describe the difference between property and capital, and do it in your most condescending means.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:00:45
You still haven't explained why capital and property are different. Is it safe to assume you don't know? All you did was pull a book reference out of your asshole. 
I highly recommend "Economics in one lesson" by Hazlitt, because the term "capital" refers to both property and cash as well as assets such as stocks, and since most people consider cash, stocks, etc. to be property, the term is practically interchangeable with property.
Keep up the good work, numb nuts.

The silliness of the  argument sometimes strikes me at weird times. If you're vaccinated, you're mostly safe. Sometimes vaccines aren't effective, and you're a threat to those around you.
The number of people whose vaccinations don't take dwarfs the amount of people that aren't being vaccines because they think it will turn their kids into dolphins.

That's probably the most useful thing, right there, transmitting money without having to rely on middle men.

I am totally not going to suggest you disregard taxes entirely and anonymize your transactions. You definitely should not try to evade taxes using Bitcoin. That's illegal, no matter how simple it would be to do so.

I think that, unless something crazy happens, in the next 5-10 years Bitcoin is likely to remain king. If you are a new investor, it seems that Bitcoin is the safest bet.
That being said, 21M bitcoin looks like not a lot of bitcoin, but a bitcoin can be broken to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 2,100,000,000,000,000 total satoshis will exist if I counted my zeroes right.

If the file is sent in an insecure fashion, and the password is sent through another fashion (itself also insecure), the chances of someone being able to exploit both is pretty minimal, so that works.

The point of bitcoin is that it eliminates the need for banks. Those sorts of processes should be expected when dealing with government controlled fiat currency. 
If you want to get around that nonsense, purchase the bitcoin locally. There will probably be a slight markup for this, but it will allow you to get around the bitcoin banking. 
Also, once bitcoin starts eliminating fiat, I doubt you'll really have much of that, if any.

But that defeats the purpose of having bitcoin in the first place.
The limits should be set by those who are actually mining the shit, considering they're the ones who have to host the blocks. Either that, or actually get rid of older blocks (seeing as they should be unnecessary anyway with merkel trees).

to put this in your conky setup, do this plus a -t after the watch to remove the header. 
    watch -t 'curl -s  | jq ".data.prices[0].price"'
EDIT Fuck it doesn't work, I'm thinking that the tickrate of Conky is faster than the time it takes for me to actually grab the fucking price, so by the time the price is grabbed, conky is off grabbing the price again. Might mitigate this by writing it to a text file. Will obsessively hack at this until I give up.
Also, I've already tried getting rid of the "watch" aspect.

Miners are doing the work. Miners *are* the network. Their preference should be preferred. If you want to dispute it, you should become a miner and actually help process transactions on the network. In the mean-time, you're just a free-rider, and you don't get to decide where the driver steers.

The biggest job of the LP in my opinion is to educate humans on libertarianism.

I didn't even know that coinbase was having problems outside the normal ones during a bubble, but I'm going to do my purchases through cex.io from now on. That's pretty messed up.
