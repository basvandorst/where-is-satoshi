As a community, I think we could turn this around. Some people ask what to do with bitcoin, where to spend it, waht's it good for besides speculation and/or investments. Since what Bitfinex needs is bitcoin (not dollars) I am surprised no one has proposed a crowd sourcing. ETH raised a lot of ether for the DAO (150 million dollars worth), I think with 10 times the market cap and the need for half the investment, the bitcoin community could raise the bitcoin needed.

I've never used a fee higher than .39 cents (biggest spend ~9 BTC)

Inside job or not, it wasn't a "hack". It was a security failure.

Someone needs to do a study of common casino money management and security procedures. The default attitude of casino exec is that EVERYONE is a thief. that mind-set is inherently safer than SOME people are thieves. 
Lazy management or inside job? Same result.

America is not bitcoin's future. America is the status quo, silly to think change will come from status quo

720 by end of September, I buy little every day since last fall, I find it better than big chunks of money at once. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:15:57
This theory has merit.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:23:06
I've been seeing the same thing re: Bitcoin. Could be over June/July highs by September. I also noticed volume on the "dead cat bounce" was significantly higher than the sell off, which is bullish.
On another note, I've been a Bitcoin believer for a while. I haven't yet seen an alt coin I want to invest in. I got some steem cheap but tripled my money and got out. I bought some etc and booked a nice gain. Just don't see use case for these things. 
Am I wrong in thinking any improvement will be folded into Bitcoin? Why own dash? Or lite coin? Or etc/ETH?

there are currently 5 players sitting at 100 tables. I didn't see anyone playing

i used the beta address and it worked fine. still would like a list of safe servers

Maybe but in my somewhat limited experience the meters always favor the power provider.

It's shit like this gonna bring this situation to a head!
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:04:24
Have you resolved the issue?
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:53:58
This is my understanding. Not all users understand change addresses and UTXOs. 
Like me, I dont know shit compared to a developer but it doesn't matter BC I use a trezor and practice common sense security measures when dealing w exchanges and other bitcoiners.

I'd put up a couple Bitcoin for equity in bitfinex. Just bitcoiners could buy say 90% of the company from current investors making them whole on theirs vestments, money raised could make bitfinex acct holders whole, no bankruptcy, and no messing with the blockchain.

Feels like uber. 
Independent tellers/dealers similar to uber owner/operators. Am I thinking of this right? 
That would be a great enabler for some. I'd hold more BTC if buying and selling weren't taxable events.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:46:10
Of course, one of those two things must be true but neither can be proved. 
If an address has a single transaction and I never make another transaction from that address I don't see how anyone could prove anything without more evidence. 
I buy BTC to pay for cam girls. Yes I have a big problem. I'm probably spending $2500 a month on cam girls. Where are they? I don't know, somewhere in russia or china or brazil or ghana.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:29:11
so when is "lunch time" for BTC? or breakfast time or dinner time or before work or after work and which timezones? 
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:41:28
Coinbase is great for this. Since its automated (and the commission is a straight %), I buy x amount a day instead of y amount a week or month. Also it's easy to suspend, renew and adjust the amount/frequency. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:06:55
I've been buying 21$ a day and I'm up to 11.5 BTC.
I don't even know my avg price and I don't care. My plan is to continue buying until I have 21 BTC or the price trades above $3500: whichever happens 2nd. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:29:48
I'm not a bitcoin expert by any means.
But I bought a trezor a couple months ago and it's a cool product. anyway, every transaction I've done through my trezor has had a unique address. So my understanding is that the trezor itself has no single address. 
As long as unique addresses are used for every transaction, I don't think "they" (gov't, SEC, whoever) can associate a particular address with a particular person.  
I would like clarification on this. Maybe a more experienced user can shed some light on the details or correct me if I'm wrong.

How much BTC does it cost?
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:07:13
Deposit dollars, transfer to exchange, cross bid/offer, withdraw BTC to wallet, transfer to cold storage or different wallet, repeat. Commission/fees = zero  ����
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:08:10
24H volume on coinbase usually around 6500 BTC, the last 24 hours is over 10K.  It is a generally recognized that moves on heavy volume are "more" legit than moves on avg or below avg volume. By that measure this move is real and sustainable. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:25:37
yes but a hundred thousand people buying $20 would have more influence than one person buying a million and not just because of price pressure. a few big buyers can be sniffed out and gamed but tens or hundreds of thousands buying in indiscriminate amounts and irregular patterns . . ? 
Despite all the negatives out there, I think FOMO is the bigger fear than the price crashing or the technology breaking or the miners or whatever.  Animal Spirits!
