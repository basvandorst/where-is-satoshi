Now that is painful as fuck.
Sorry to do this to you, but how much did you lose?
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:57:05
Okay, thank you.
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:58:20
Okay, deal!
I have none. Enjoy.

Very interesting, thank yo, very interesting for clearing that up.
So it still, even if they were to make up an arrangement like "no bitcoin until the money is in your account" deals were made, it could still go wrong for the seller?

You should give it to who ever posts on this thread first.
Oh, would you look at that...
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:45:27
Turns out the website is legitimate, but the guy I was buying off scammed me. But yeah, it does look a little... cheap.
Doesn't matter though, it's all being worked out.
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:08:06
Excellent, much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:49:05
Okay, thanks for clearing that up.
But what if I give him the item and then he takes back the funds from escrow?
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:25:01
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2014-11-11 23:59:27
Okay fair enough. Do you think this one is fake? 
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:01:20
Ahh, I didn't know that's what it was doing. So it's like that for everyone even if you were to install Bitcoin Core on a new computer?
Thanks for clearing that up for me, I appreciate it.
Oh awesome, I'll have a look at that now.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:05:20
I emailed their website and gave them the transaction number. He said that the bitcoins were never even sent, so I have actually been scammed.
Right now I'm working on getting my account back.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:21:00
Okay I get you. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:03:33
You mean as in me giving him his part of the deal early?
Or him releasing it before he gets it?
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:44:08
Well what i really meant was; what's stopping the hackers from doing this? For example:
Someone visits tor while using tails, gets some stolen credit cards, buys some bitcoin, tumbles them. Done, is there even a way to stop that from happening?
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:47:54
Yeah I've been scammed. I emailed them and apparently the coins were never sent, even though I got a payment confirmed email.
I'm going to send in a steam support ticket and try to get it back.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:41:22
How so?
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:21:38
Nah, it just seemed weird at first since this is my first transaction ever.
I think it'll go okay after all.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:56:42
Can anyone help me out with my question?
Say I send him my information.. what's stopping him from taking the money back from escrow and scamming me? I'm just shitscared of getting scammed.
Like, what is stopping him from screwing me over?
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:14:37
Well I am now the PROUD owner of [1almond.com!](
