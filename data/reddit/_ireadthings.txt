I wish I was part of a marketing campaign. I was contacted by support and finally got a reply, and Coinbase's response is that they can't tell me any further information, I'm ineligible, go pound sand.
I'm a total BTC noobie. I mined coins years ago on a lark, forgot about them, found them recently and decided to cash them out. I did a bit of research and went with Coinbase for this, but apparently I shouldn't have!
edit: I'm pretty sure they won't be showing up here to reply to me, given that they already did that once in my thread I referenced in OP and their support replied to me (finally). I'm moderately pissed off about this, but not going to waste any more energy thinking about them. I just want to get these BTC somewhere where I can cash them out and continue playing with a couple of them on day trading to turn them into smaller and smaller amounts :)

Got it; thanks!

Exactly. I can still transfer the BTC out, but I can't buy or sell through Coinbase or Coinbase Exchange. Their final reply to my support ticket was "This decision is based on an assessment of your account activity. We’re unable to elaborate further on our review processes for security reasons. This decision is final and cannot be overturned."
Research I did on this reply indicates that it's usually given to people who use BTC for gambling or other purposes that the US government/Coinbase doesn't approve of. My coins have been sitting on a hard disk in a closet for years after they were mined, and I sent them directly to Coinbase, so I'm pretty sure that's not the reason for the account lockdown.

Thanks very much; I'll check out Uphold after I finish setting up Circle.

I really don't understand Coinbase. Around a year ago (I think) when it was around 300-400 per coin I found a small stash of them on an ancient hard drive that I had mined in the very early days of bitcoin. I needed the cash at that point for family stuff so I signed up for Coinbase, got verified and everything and started selling. I sold around 18k worth over a period of 2-3 months. Nothing all that big compared to the big players.
I kept a couple to play with on gdax because I figured it would be fun. I probably made 5-10 trades total. About 2 weeks after I signed up for gdax they banned me completely from gdax and coinbase. No reason, no explanation, no nothing. Just a "gtfo" kind of thing.
