I don't believe in an investigation, but I admit it may be.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:20:23


 Thank. Did your friend end up with Coinbase well?
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:40:24
yes i read
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:41:22


   
I do not know what I think about this situation.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:15:33
Thanks for the information, but the support already knows about the problems of withdrawal, but something prevents them from opening my withdrawal to me.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:07:48
It is impossible to store anything at all at similar platforms
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:45:18
 What is broken does not say, but it does not matter. In their letter they demand to withdraw my funds, but I cannot withdraw as the withdrawal is closed.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:10:27
Yes, in support of responsible bots and nobody deals with my problem, answers standard
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:16:23
I will wait when they will be engaged in my problem
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:32:03


If I did what you write, then I think I would have talked with other services than Coinbase)
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:09:13






so they could report that an investigation is underway, the blocking will take time and indicate which one. But they sent a message that the account is closed and I can withdraw my funds. And it would be something really serious, they would have sent another letter and not so kind
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:30:09
Can you imagine the support of Coinbase? or is that your opinion? I hope blocking accounts Coinbase does not take into account what good or bad English says the client and it was just a misunderstanding. Today Coinbase opened a withdrawal of my funds, the problem I hope is closed. I'm not Chinese, I'm European. But I do not think that you can block the account based on the nationality of the client is not correct.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:19:43
I've already been told that they can take a long time, months to conduct an internal investigation
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:30:15


 Nothing unique. The situation is only that "we want you to go away and withdraw your money, but we will not let you do it"
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:05:34
Do you also have problems with Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:05:53
hope too
@_date: 2019-05-24 05:01:12
Thank you!  if you can send
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:04:22
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:04:36


Let not give details, this is right. But in their letter they said in the account that I could take everything where I wanted to, but they forgot to include this output and do not answer questions in support.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:59:57
While they do not allow anything. The withdrawal is closed and do not respond to letters. Only messages come in that the next sent my message is closed and appreciate the support.  And so for 21 days
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:27:54
agree with that
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:23:05
I found the message and warning when it happened I closing the account. I especially iskatel was one about the same problem, and found a lot of posts and complaints that such problems were
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:36:57










 Yes you are right, I was wrong that I trusted them (
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:43:23














Thank you for the joke)
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:26:09










These are all our guesses and assumptions. If your account was blocked and did not answer the questions, I think you would not be happy either. The conflict could have been avoided and I do not want a conflict with Coinbase. But I do not know what is happening and why the conclusion is closed.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:50:46


   
Too serious for my modest account, there was the last operation in early April.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:32:02
Also translated into electrum wallet. More such as Coinbase do not trust
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:38:53






I know that others had a similar problem, including posting on reddit, then everything was solved safely. Each time a similar rationale was used for blocking.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:43:58






thank you for your advice
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:06:24
Yes, I was shocked by the disregard of support, they responded only to the first messages, and you do not know what to do and how to react
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:51:00
   
The question is that Coinbase offered me to withdraw my funds but the withdrawal does not ... I would have no problem at all, I am ready to withdraw everything ... is Coinbase ready to let me withdraw? I violated your rules so expel me and give mine as you yourself and offered
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:17:39
Support never talked about the investigation. I do not think it is a secret to say "we are investigating." They promised to appoint a person in charge who would help me in the very first message and then they simply ignored the letters.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:08:31


 So it is, you must leave us, but we will not let you do it
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:22:51


 thanks you
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:20:05










I also do not think and do not want to think but ignore why, and say that so much time is needed and we will open the withdrawal of funds. It would be something serious that I would have done in 20 days already.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:21:17
Thank you for your advice
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:46:24


   
I did not like the lies of the platform itself. If they lied about the withdrawal of funds, then why don’t they lie to the rest
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:34:41
 So I will, it is impossible that someone controls your coins
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:53:24






thanks, I still hope that everything will be resolved peacefully
