The 2fa part? Yeah, you should really enable that. Then the notification will go away.

Yeah you got it.
No question is a bad question. Just know the audience on here may have an average age of...well never mind. Average intelligence of...shit, never mind that one too. 
I like to view this site strictly for fun. Not exactly for research. There are some great redditors out there and some shady af ones too. Just know the source. Trust your gut, and hodl!
Investopedia is a great site. Yahoo finance usually has pretty in depth articles/research too.

That is awesome!
You can absolutely eat it. As long as the steak was handled in a hygienic manner. 
Sear it and open a bottle of wine.

Yachts just depreciate in value. I work on them, trust me. Biggest waste of money.  Real estate is a better bet.

Refers to basic trading terms.. Where is the resistance, where is the pull back to? 24 hours vs one week? The volume? Look up trading basics.  You will find a lot of info on Investopedia, TD Ameritrade and other sites of the ilk. You will see many people talking about due diligence, aka DD. These are all questions you have to answer yourself. Become truly interested in the answers you come up with, not just from this site. Too many uninformed folks. Set your stop loss orders, and hodl!!

This is universal. Hodlers of Btc, bch, eth, ltc...everyone has their opinions. 
To each his/her own. Simple as that. 
Just tired of all the hating/bashing.

Wake up and check the price then drink some coffee, again checking the price. Shower, check the price, drive to a crappy job, checking the price. Go to said crappy job, constantly checking the price. Grab a beer after work, check the price, chat with friends about the price, then go home. Check price, go to bed, dream that it was the year 2009 and I knew what I know now. Wake up, repeat.

Whoa, Trump. Easy. This isnt about mosques. 
This is about every hodler out there thinking their coins are better than the other and bashing anyone else who may have a different opinion.
Easy on the eggnog. Lighten up.

Rent is covering everything but repairs. It is covering taxes, and general maintenance. If not the landlord is a fiscal moron. Yes you are right, houses dont necessarily go up in value, and can go down like during the sub prime fiasco. My comment to OP is to not pay rent, that their money can go further by not paying someone else’s mortgage. Ideally, hodl the bitcoins...unless his moon is reached or they need the liquid cash. But it is their money. They can do what they want with it.

Yeah true,  but does your car or computer need a full time staff to run them?
Yachts are toys. Your car gets you to point b, maybe your job, which makes you money. Your computer can make you money. The yacht, just gets you laid. 
Then again, come to think of it...isnt that a major reason for making money?

Why would you pay someone else’s mortgage?? What do you have to show for all the time spent paying rent? Nothing. A mortgage can build equity.
