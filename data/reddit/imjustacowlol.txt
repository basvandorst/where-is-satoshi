CBitcoin is based off of the program that you can download there, to which they refer as Bitcoin Core ("Download Bitcoin Core") :p
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:55:32
You are absolutely right about the first part. If you scroll down a bit lower in the comments, you'll see there was a discussion about terminology (Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin protocol). I changed the post a bit during that conversation, but it should probably be changed to the original post again.
Concerning GUI header: GUI headers (the way I have always used the term) are software that implement a GUI over an already existing layer of software. Example: there are several browsers that are based on Chromium, with Chrome being one of those browsers. It is not uncommon to call Chrome a 'header' for Chromium.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:20:25
Haha, no problem, misunderstandings can happen. Especially with all the confusion around terminology going on the last weeks c.q. months. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:06:03
Contributing to the main Bitcoin Core repo would not allow for rapid implementation of new features/functoinality around Bitcoin. SegWit has been out for ages and still hasn't been implemented into bitcoin-qt. 
CBitcoin is there to function as a lightweight, easy to maintain GUI that can push updates with minimal effort in a short timespan :)

mp3 is still the most used format for audio files and will probably stay so for a long long time. New codecs are even written for it on a regular basis to increase compression while maintaining audio quality.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:07:34
Screenshots will be coming later this week :) The software is still in it's very early stages and is not ready to be used. Also some parts of the GUI still have to be made or adjusted.
But, like I said, they will come :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:41:26
oh gawd...
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:56:45
Will do, after the core functionality has been implemented :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:14:45
I'll take $1000 and your accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:56:24
I have just added this to the to-do list. It might still take a little while before the software will have it's first stable build, but it'll definitely be implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:57:10
Thank you for the feedback! I will immediatly work on properly refering to Bitcoin properly. 
The thing is, on  they also refer to it as Bitcoin Core, hence the reason I chose to name it that way.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:12:30
and my software is based off of Bitcoin Core. It physically requires Bitcoin Core to run.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:40:16
OP here, it was a genuine thing. I want the main page to stay clean and not pollute it with questions of which I thought the answer would be known to most people.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:50:57
I don't really see myself as a newbie. I just never got a clear explanation of how SegWit works on a technical level with relation to the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:06:26
I'll go for c-lightning then. Cheers bud! I'll set it up tomorrow :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:49:31
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:35:39
Ahh okay. And it generates a wallet.dat file which is SegWit? Or do you mean the addresses which are used for receiving/sending Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:52:15
That's why you don't keep your coins at a fucking exchange
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:42:04
With an eye on the massive price increase that happened this month, I'd say be cautious. In the last 24 hours we've had a 'dip' to 13.5k. What it'd do is; try to buy back in one of those dips (make sure that the exchange/broker you buy from has also adjusted it's price accordingly with the dip) and just hodl on to it. The price might drop below your investment point and it might even stay there for a few weeks, but don't panic. In the long run you'll profit, as long as you don't let your emotions get the better of you.

Elaborate? :p
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:37:31
What site are you using to track the price? I'm using coindesk.com/price but it seems to be quite inaccurate from time to time
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:40:57
Might be. It could temporarily overshoot though :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:21:57
Quantum computing is not suited for a lot of types of calculations. It's REALLY GOOD for a selective set of calculations.
It might be suitable for assisting in e.g. Bitcoin mining to a certain extend but it can't do it on it's own.

@_date: 2017-08-25 10:03:32
Before we continue the discussion, what are you using to mine bitcoin with? If you use GPU/CPU miners I suggest you turn em off as they will probably consume more costs in power than that you will receive in bitcoin.
If you do use dedicated bitcoin miners; the 'accepted' column shows the amount of shares with the pool that have been accepted.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:00:11
I am currently using blockchain. Soon i'll be switching to Bitcoin-qt (core) wallet. It's synchronizing as we speak.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:21:28

Hahaha, touché buddy, touché.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:54:19
It's honestly more efficient to just simply sell unsuitable mining hardware and buy physical bitcoins rather than investing in anything else than ASIC miners.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:51:24
Hahahaha, would be amazing. Just crossed 4700!!!

@_date: 2017-08-29 13:39:09
I'll compare the two. On CoinDesk it was $4545,45 just a bit ago xD
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:32:44
Feels goed doesnt it? :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:08:15
Usage remains the same, but the way data is stored in the blocks is different and transactions will be handled slightly different.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:14:39
I'm there to stick around as well. I'm getting married next year in august. I am saving up all the money I am earning but I won't sell the 1/4th of a Bitcoin I have. One day it might be worth a lot and with that in mind I'll hold on to it :)

Don't worry bud, it'll drop below 6k again sometime or atleast there'll be another good oppertunity.

Which is perfect, means more discount for us.

@_date: 2017-09-18 20:39:54
100% normal. You can use previous 'receive addresses' as well (although this is heavily frowned upon for most cases)

I asked a question mr smartypants
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:16:09
why not tho? Bitcoin can adapt. It has got by far the largest and most diverse development 'team' (not sure how to call all the volunteers) and has proven to be one of the most resillient currencies.
They will keep upgrading Bitcoin with new technologies that fit the demands of currency.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:51:47
Possibly. It's also very possible that Bitcoin will just laugh it off and not give a damn.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:14:19
hahaha, don't worry about it man. I bought 130 @ 4100, 120  and then 150 @ 3500 (post-dip).  On the long term it isn't that much of a deal :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:47:49
That's actually a pretty damn good comparison... Damn.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:52:07
So what? won't change that the manipulating is temporary and once bitcoin gets more support it won't be as prone to such manipulation anymore. Aside from that: We are simply having a correction. Nothing fancy spancy about that.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:59:02

Hahaha, as much as I love your positive view, we have to stay realistic. Expect heavy resistance from this point on.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:37:25
We will, especially with my attitude. It isn't healthy for any type of currency or object to spike in price as much as BTC is right now. It needs a steady growth that can be maintained at a consistent phase. It doesn't need short spikes after which it'll drop below it's actual support again.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:57:49
It's AES-256 encrypted. Find the password/phrase to decrypt it and bingo.
