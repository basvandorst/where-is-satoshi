A better idea would be to sell them for bitcoins. Apple already took their money so what does it care if you smash the phones.

FYI Bitcoin did flash crashed last night

Stop complaining this is only good for us. Now go outside and find yourself something worth whinning about.

I got a 30%. Is that good?

Why dont you buy stuff with them then sell the stuff for cash

If hes selling anything on ebay worth the same amount just buy it then make a claim for "not as described" product, return him an empty box. Later on text him "now we are even"

Bitcoin atm made 81 trnsactions totaling $10k. That doesnt seem like a failure to me.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:06:49
Damn bro. You got a lot money. Well... you used to.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:26:42
Ive never seen this graph before except to predict bubbles. Every revolutionary product goes through this bubble pattern
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:38:56
I see what you're saying, and it doesnt have to be to yourself. The mere act of buying and selling creates liquidity, which will add speed to the rising prices. But this can only work when the market was up already and you would also need to be selling and buying hundreds of bitcoins a day, maybe thousands.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:40:18
Cant help but to say that you must feel like an idiot right now for getting out.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:09:28
Mustve been an awesome feeling breaking the $1,000 mark

I think btc has enough momentum to reach 500 before the next big drop. So im holding till then
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:17:56
I was thinking of setting up a bitcoin exchange kiosk. Im still working on this idea
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:22:46
We don't ask those type of questions here, they endanger the stability of bitcoin.

So you're sucker... I mean buyer that I sold them to. Well nice to meet you!
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:06:04
No need to trust me. Look at the spreads. Source of my story is a bitcoin entrepeneur with connections to mt gox.
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:52:09
How did you know it would rise back up?
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:19:57
Do you really think coinbase, w site with thousands of transactons a day, cancels peoples orders everytime price goes up a lot? If that were the case reddit would be swarming with posts from angry customers.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:04:26
Not sure how big of an attention span you have but theres more to the story than just price fluctuation.
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:56:52
I think by 2020 it can reach double that amount at LEAST
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:04:18
Yea stop being a whinney baby
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:34:18
Not sure if you know this but the feds are going to convert those bitcoins into cash. More bitcoins up for sale = more supply available and thats why prices have collapsed
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:42:06
Of course theres no precedent. Bitcoins have only been around less than decade. But feds always use seized money to combat more crime. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:23:30
Like all great innovations during their starting stage, bitcoin price will be driven up exponentially by speculation. It will come crashing down when time is due. No, the fall will not be pretty, but this cycle of boom and bust is expected from innovative products and even required for future price stability
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:50:56
Or you can act as a different craigslist user and ask him to prove he owns that ebay accnt
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:50:31
I'm going to need proof for this one
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:41:14
This happened to me also. Mt gox lost my 155 bitcoins in the same way a yr ago. Stay away from them
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:31:00
Why not? Do you even know what a ponzi scheme is?

1. Every fiat currency is a ponzi scheme. The US debt is big ponzi scheme since Dollars are not backed up by gold, they are backed up by more dollars.
2. Every bitcoin is backed up by money. 
3. Every bitcoin has value, you can exchange a bitcoin for something else or for cash. 
4. For as long as bitcoins can be redeemable to cash, they are not a ponzi scheme. The only way they would be a ponzi scheme is if money itself became obsolete.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:15:58
Uh no. There has always been new blood and the spread never dissappeared. Even with huge ramp ups the spread was above $10 sometimes 25

How dare you post a hilarious meme on a non-meme subreddit.

Every new technology goes through what are called bubbles. The bubble cycle occurs because people dont know what to expect of the new technology and this causes high volatility in the demand and supply curve. Once people realize the new technology's potential they all want to get on the band wagon, they enter the stage of euphoria  causing a bubble.  However, this euphoria always takes prices to irrational levels. Once reality sets in people become fearful and rush out causing the bubble to burst. This happened to every single revolutionary innovation in human history and you can see why.

Mt gox and bitstamp are now trading at equal prices. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:40:42
These guys are heavily invested in bitcoin so of course they are going to pump the crap out of it. Take their advice with a grain of salt. No matter how successful thy have been so far.

The next top will be at 500. The usual psycological resistance price. Everybody will sell once it gets there. I know because btc is behaving exactly like a stock and ive analyzed stock charts since 2003

I'm sure there will be ps4's available after the launch date.

Its lagging, price is reaching $1100 right now.
