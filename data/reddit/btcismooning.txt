in a yr or two I think we are at the same price or lower than we are now. Obviously good news doesnt positively affect the btc price, only negative. We have several new big merchants accepting, an institutional bitcoin fund(gabi) that will launch in a week and not a whisper of bad news and we are still going down.

@_date: 2014-08-27 20:51:16
Lol. There are three types of bitcoin people: the spenders, the hodlers and the weak hands.The spenders have been buying and spending btc as a means since others were/are willing to take it, so price doesnt matter. The hodlers are still for the most part still hodling the majority of their coins(this includes early adopters) and the last group is the weak hands or traders. they have bought and sold from 1 cent to $1000 and down again.  What I am getting at is there are not many people who became millionaires buying at $10 and selling at $1000. So no going by what you are saying smart money hasnt gotten in yet only early adopters.
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:36:39
quick answers are for ? 1: seller supplies btc qr code and buyer uses smartphone to read and send coin. number 2: I would make them put a wallet on a smartphone to accept btc
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:44:59
yes all alts are pump and dump schemes. Just depends on how long the pump can go for. litecoin is ded. I can see etherium die. Money will eventually run out. vitaly buterin leaves the company over a disagreement. Then he will move on with something else and pump that project. wash, rinse, repeat. If everyone would concentrate on btc until that goes mainstream I think we would have been further ahead than we are now. but everyone wants to stake their own claim. working as a group would probably be financially better for everyone but free market and all. so I guess we hurry to wait

yet another pump and dump piece of shit coin.
@_date: 2014-07-26 16:54:40
thats not good. you would think the early adopters have already sold if they were going to cash out. they either sold while they were dropping from $1000 or the sold the bottom @ the $400 area? just a guess. to sell now makes no sense. The miners who are selling are fools. so you are saying that if someone sold 50000 btc to goldman sachs we would have to take their word? who is going to open their books to the public? nobody.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:54:33
IInstitutions buy $25 million minimum in whatever they invest in. 38000 btc can't be bought that quietly. And that one institution. If we don't go up big on Aug 1 or there abouts it will be very troubling

@_date: 2014-08-28 20:30:36
according to wikipedia there are 13 million millionaires on the planet. None of them or any billionaires in the world have not been forced to go directly to any exchange and pay market price for say 20000 coins? I have never seen it. Might never. All the deals may go down in back rooms. actually sad the little people get fucked again :(
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:45:56
I would tell people to go all in right now @ $500. There is no reason to wait seriously. Hopefully we will have higher lows. Save a little if the price dips down to $400. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:06:59
so you must be in the black. congrats on catching the bottom. might as well hodl because if we get back to price levels of 3 months ago ($400's) the game is over

nobody has any money left. those who got in are bagholding. there is no new money coming into the exchanges and there wont be until there is a legit exchange. im not putting anymore in until we get to at least $700 to prove we are going up. Ill pay the extra to know that the wheel is in motion to move forward. right now investing in btc its a blackhole. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:12:44
yes the actual liquidity pool is missing a factor(z). because as we speak all the very large buys are happening off the exchanges and because they are done on some form of paper wallet they will never be accounted for in determining a price, for what could be forever. so for example if you knew goldman sach and jp morgan were buying like crazy off exchange wouldnt that skew the price of bitcoin to the upside just by having the knowledge that they believe and are buying would shoot the price to $1000 plus easy. but we may never know this. has winklevoss, richard branson, silbert, roger ver, andreas, patrick byrne, gavin andressen, shrem  etc and the list goes on, have they ever dilvulged and proven how many coins they have? See where I am getting whatever happens outside3 of the liquidity pool has no bearing on the actual price until that factor (z) is somehow added to the equation
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:36:00
keep it 
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:09:05
so you bought all the tops and sold the bottoms eh? so looks like we are going down cuz you are buying another top lol

so basically the whales are killing btc, because they are biting the hand that feeds them. I get it, if you are a whale you have money blah blah blah, but they just fucked over a years worth of people and new money coming in by extracting all of the fiat that was pumped into the system. so do you think they are going to put their hard earned money in again? no. are they going to recommend a losing investment to freind and family? no.  personally at this point I dont give a crap. big money is not stupid. They would be in already and this thing would have taken off by wall street standards already. So its catch 22, either get fucked continually by the whales, or get fucked by the wall street bankers if they ever decide to get in. So the whales greed killed it. They could have let the price run for a year, but you have a bunch of amateur traders who dont let winners run. They sell and then when they miss the price they want, when there is a bounce they put up a sell wall which never gets filled. Then down again

Yes price should increase with scarcity, but if there are x number of coins always floating between the exchanges that constant is the same only the price changes. And coins outside the exchange are unaccounted for. So how does one figure if the coins are becoming more scarce?
@_date: 2014-08-08 08:52:09
you are kidding right? for all intensive purposes you might as well call $420 the bottom. Nobody knew that was the bottom at that time. We had been free falling from $800 in January. People were talking about the price going to retest $260. I want a flash crash to buy low not a slow bleed.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:05:49
@_date: 2014-07-12 02:01:55
Its an easy answer. Btc within a year go to $1 million each. All people holding btc right now are instant millionaires. Let em do what they want. :)
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:08:16
yes they could offer a 1 % interest rate for business' for them to hodl the btc rather than immediately converting to fiat.  bitpay or coinbase would easily make 1 %  just based on the fact that they wouldnt be dumped all the coin relentlessly. customers may want to even keep the btc if they are going up.
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:23:30
bill gates would drive the price right down to the floor.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:33:50
just keep buying from the weak hands and welcome the price drop. this is a gift at these and possibly lower levels. I would have never thought that btc would be $450 in August 2014 though :(

your in trouble dude. better get a lawyer
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:41:05
It means there are no more buyers. i wouldnt be surprised if btc plummets just to get people to spend fiat at exchanges or it will suppress all the selling.
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:05:52
Myth: investing in btc will make you rich.
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:27:15
whales can manipulate the market up or down because they have the biggest stacks of coins. they just keep bleeding the fiat out of the bitcoin ecosystem. so nobody else makes any money but them. for example you get a run to $680. the first dump starts it all we go to $650, bounce to $665 people buy, dump to $635, rise to $650, dump to $610 bounce to $620, dump  to $585 and so on so basically all the people who enter in will lose unless you are a whale with 300+ coins because they make decent money on every $5-$10 move(300btc X $5= $1500. rinse repeat. so unless you caught the bottom in the high $300's earlier this year we are closing in on the price rage where everyone who bought and held this year LOST $$$$. Sounds like a winner to me.
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:55:44
all you people do on here is try to jam btc down everyone fucking throat. you people are fucking suffocating. let it evolve on it own for fucks sake. whole foods accepting bitcoin right now is stupid. you have a bunch of uptight, phony, label gloating, snobs shopping there that could give two shits about bitcoin.

can someone tell him to buy some btc on the open market ffs
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:36:22
I can sum up what took you several paragraphs to say in a few sentences. Unless a whale buys or sells there is no price movement. Most traders are in fiat when a whale buys they jump in, bleed out the new fiat the comes in rinse and repeat. so if amazon starts accepting btc if the whales don't feel like buying the price isn't going to move.
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:23:27

i disagree. you are talking about investing not using. is too expensive to buy the actual coins for investment right now maybe? but its not too expensive to use  and send money to another country. The price doesnt matter.If someone wants to buy a bag of weed on the silkroad what do they care if the price of btc is $10 or $1000 they will get the equivalent of their local currency and spend it. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:31:39
too techie for whole foods shoppers. they would need to dumb it way down for all the snobs who shop there. The shoppers at whole foods are the same lemmings who wait in 10 deep lines to buy a $6 coffee from starbucks every morning and think they are getting a great deal. Or the dumb housewife who buys a $100 pair of yoga pants at lululemon. Its all about status. they are too dumb to take advantage of something as good as bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-07-20 19:10:20
I have been observing and taking notes on the btc traders on btc-e and bitstamp. They are going to get eaten alive when wall street comes in. I am not a professional trader but I have traded stocks for 25 yrs and the traders of btc breaking every basic rule of trading 101. They ride losses into the ground, panic buy and sell, and are manipulated by every little rumor. The most glaring is the traders patience. Nobody has ever heard of the term letting your winners run. They would rather sell and try to catch a falling knife over and over. They actually like it when the price falls so they can buy back in. Its not like they are short btc and cheering, they just want to see the price crash so they can buy back in. Another thing the majority of the traders are either broke or are bagholding. So when new money comes in they sell their bags. Game is going to change soon. News like Dell if wall street was in would have been a ridiculous rise, but until new money is pumped in expect a pop then a slow bleed out. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 02:09:22

Btc price was manipulated from the beginning by Mt Gox. It was all fake. Volume, trades etc. So every bubble from $32 to $266 to $1000 was created artificially. There was never any actual real fiat to back up any of the pricing thats why Mt gox could not pay anyone out. So we could fall all the way back into double digits and can anyone actually say hey thats not fair? No because in the very beginnings btc was a pump and dump and still is.
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:07:30
I am going to go out on a limb here and say the reason chuck is in trouble is because he didnt pay off whoever he was supposed to and they blew the whistle on him. organized crime wants their piece of the pie. and after he was arrested he should have just cashed in his btc and paid off whoever needed to be paid off to get out of trouble. there is a price for everything.

Mt gox was the market leader and they turned out to be scammers right? so all the trades, volume and pricing was fake. The prices you are looking at in the past are FAKE! Is bitcoin a game changer? Hell yes! But we will never see those types of gains again because it was all a lie to begin with.

@_date: 2014-08-27 20:28:35
Let me ask this then. There are several btc exchanges with some sum of bitcoins(call it "x") that float around and are recycled(bought and sold) on a regular basis by the traders. Say x never varies in quantity of  + or - 1000 btc. How would anyone ever know if btc is becoming more scarce? 
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:30:24
2000 bitcoin for the whole world is that much to buy per day???????? there are millions and millions of people who are either in and hodling or new money coming in from all corners of the world. I dont believe the world cant absorb 2000 coins a day.

yes it does suck to be down a quick $30. but hopefully you have some reserves left and can buy a little more if the price continues to fall. Let me ask you this, if you bought at $500 and it went to $600 the next day would you sell? if yes you are a trader, no means you are looking at the big picture and hodling out for $5000. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:09:20
so i assume you are not going to buy bitcoin since doing your research?
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:37:59
I am not trying to convince anyone. I am just stating facts. Doesnt matter if the price is $1 or $1000. if it was fake and fraudulent from the beginning it still is.  Wall street banks, hedge funds and other institutions need to be convinced for this thing to work.

its totally manipulated. there are no rules for bitstamp, bitfinex or btc-e to name a few. the owners can front run every order if they want to and Im sure they do. its all one big pump and dump for right now. But the worse part id there really is no pumps anymore just dumps into fiat. I bet one of the main exchanges goes out of business soon or will need to get recapitalized with fiat. you have people converting literally worthless pieces of shit alts into bitcoin then cashing out. so they take out and nothing get put into the system.

Its just a pump and dump stock. This company did the same thing w ntx trader. Stock doubled in a day to $3 then straight to the floor right after
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:06:23
I think this is huge. Have they said anything about how and how much they plan to give away?
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:46:24
all I know is that there is not enough buyers for all the selling that is going on whether it be coinbase or bitpay or miners etc. Just tired of seeing the price going down all the time
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:18:07
i think everyone would agree to spend it as soon as possible because it is volatile.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:08:54
Paper wallet is best I split my coins up on several.
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:45:31
Sorry new SUCKERS money!!
@_date: 2014-07-26 13:58:02
Fortress bought their coins off the exchange just like second market. When Fortress bought, the only exchanges were  Mt gox, bitstamp and btc-e and I cant see them wiring  $150million to either bitstamp or btc-e.
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:29:06
i think we hit $500 before we hit $1000
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:02:34
dude $18 a night on expedia is expensive? 
@_date: 2014-08-31 16:38:59
my bags are full
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:21:42
depend on the amount of coins and what price they were purchased at. but just going by your buy and sell it doesnt look like you know what you are doing. you panic sold and panic bought. if you were a trader you would have shorted at $586 and either let the short run until there was a reversal or cover and shorted again. you dont buy into a falling market because everytime you do you are GUESSING! You can be wrong everytime trying to guess the bottom. you let your winners run and you are only wrong ONCE. think about it.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:33:21
dude is so smooth.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:27:57
300 sell wall @ 595 after a $10 rise 10:27pm est nice job jerk,
and $595 was the top last night. he sold 2 or 3 coins out of 300 at $595 alas rally ded. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 01:20:49
buffet is 84. ever look at what he buys? cant get any more boring stocks than what he buys.
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:21:10
WHY is it so hard for someone to understand simple logic? The price of bitcoin right now  is STILL a fake price due to MT GOX! At $100 it is fake. at $300 it is fake because is was fake from the beginning. If mt gox ran the price to $5000 people would think $2500 is a good price and it wouldnt be because it has nothing to do with speculation, it flat out fucking fraud!
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:21:07
Get ready for the mini $5 bounce and the amateur traders throw up 100's of coins on the sell side to milk out every fucking nickel from you lemmings
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:36:57
dude you are an ahole. why dont you go all in RIGHT NOW! $575 is a great price right so you can look back in hindsight and you can then pat yourself on the back. gfo
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:19:53
so you are saying $475 is expensive I disagree. there are 676 million google shares and the price is $581 and the number of shares is not capped.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:19:33
Ah yeah..I have seen this before. you are mad at bitcoin because you either missed the boat at low price levels, sold and the price continued to rise, panic bought up or $1000, or bought at the top, bought all the way down from $1000 to the $400s or recently bought in the high $500's or $600's and the price has gone against you again. I think I have covered all the bases I could think of. Just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:09:20
More relentless selling of coins and no new suckers are getting in. Keep going down and die. All the believers keep feeding the whales
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:32:02
Hey something happened? Anyways recap what I said. btc should have been on its way to higher prices already seeing we have had nothing but positive news lately, dell, gabi fund etc. yet we are going down. After absorbing as much information I could find over the last 8 months and then watching the price go to the floor in the process. So here we are 8 months later and unless you were Very lucky and bought in between $350-$450 and are still hodling you are down. You would think with all the activity that is going on with btc even the hoarders are buying more. and that is where i think there may be a problem. It is different to mine and trade for btc that take hard earned fiat and buy btc. think about it. I bet eight out of ten new accounts dont trade they are investing and the big fish are just draining that  fiat out as quickly as it is coming in. Over the last 7-8 months         
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:51:54
one thing Ii have noticed and I have traded stocks for 25 yrs. I have never seen so many bag holders in my life. I learned a long time ago. when a trade goes against you, get out and live to trade another day. people hold way too long.
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:10:26
not going to happen. the pricing since btc started trading was fake because mt gox was a scam. mt gox created fake bubbles. they arent going to happen again. sorry. I am long btc, but I dont think we are going to hit it big.
@_date: 2014-08-26 01:14:32
7% is worth it if you need btc in a hurry. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:55:21
$500 if we are lucky. Smart money is in. Who else is getting in that has millions and millions to move the market?
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:13:42
Bitcoin is a joke and I can't believe I got suckered into this pyramid scheme. Please anyone new to bitcoin save your money and do not buy I to this shit. You will just be giving it to the whales or hedge funds who are shorting it
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:46:09
Read between the lines he wants to dump
@_date: 2014-07-25 00:13:29
Think about what you are saying. So you are saying people that got in around $10 are selling NOW???? If you held to $1000+ and didnt sell, and saw the price drop to $400 and didnt sell why the fuck would you sell now? The reason the price is dropping is because there are NO buyers other than traders and they will not buy unless the price drops significantly or they ride the coat tails of a whale who buys. All the traders of BTC do is bleed out all the new fiat that comes into the exchanges plain and simple. All that money that drove the price up to $680 is gone into the pockets of the traders. Its not like stocks or bonds where the money is raised and reinvested into a company. BTC is pure gambling. I am long BTC but it is getting old. Look at the exchanges. There are no buyers. The people trading and controlling the price now are all in fiat, they can give 2 shits about btc. So why would they hold it and let the price rise through scarcity when they can just keep bleeding it out when new money comes in? Wall Street will change that IF they get in heavy. I just cant see goldman, jp morgan etc letting the little people become wealthy without a fight
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:08:28
bitcoin doesnt react like that. you are wasting your time. just buy as much as you can stomach and hodl.
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:45:20
cant you go on expedia and book a room?
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:43:17
he is even trying to pump bitcoin lol. we need barry silbert to do the offering and then pantera capital to get in. so sad everyone grasping for straws
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:57:14
ok here is a different way to look at it. there is 13 million coins that have been mined. early adapters own say more than half. so we are assuming they own 6.5 million btc right? What if all these coins are lost on paper wallets right now? We are never going to know, and that is what I am saying about the pricing model. The price should be based only on what is actually accounted for.
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:29:00
No can you name an asset that has lost 60% of its value this year and people are still buying it?
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:51:33
ffs call it what it is: a pump and dump like every other coin
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:05:38
you need to re-title  your paper to say Funding open source projects with pump and dump schemes.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:45:44
props bro, nice subtle hijacking of the topic :)
