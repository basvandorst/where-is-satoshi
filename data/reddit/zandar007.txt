It's a utopian thought and in the far future a single currency could actually help bring peace to the world. IF mankind wants that, which i am not convinced 'we' do.
One of the things that interests me about Blockchain is the ability for AI / autonomous machines to exchange value without intervention. I could imagine a world where everyone has a miner in their home. The size of a microwave with 100 times the power of a current 2,000 GPU farm. A device which earns enough money for the entire household. Your power could be automatically paid by your home "Micro-bank" to the power center.
 *Or if everyone had powerful solar panels, each house would earn coins by capturing and sharing power around a grid. 
The people in such a society would return to an almost Agrarian state. But with automation- robots would take care of farming. People would be free to pursue humanity and the arts. 
if you accept the theory of Multiverse - then somewhere, on some planet in some universe this is how people live. Advanced technology should be a tool to free people.

This quote cracks me up:
"Bitcoin popped by close to $200 soon after the news broke. The coin, which is known for its wild price swings, was trading at $9,209 a coin at last check."
- That wasn't Goldman it was someone buying a few GPU cards. =p

be careful with your wallet. Guard your keys and seed words. Take the time to learn it inside and out. know how to recover it. add a few dollars and delete it, force yourself to do a recovery.
You are going to be your own payment processor and bank. NOT FDIC insured =P

The correct answer is Hodl 
Wait another 4 months. That will put you into long term capital gains and reduce your tax burden by 50%. Plus the coins will possibly double in 5 months. 
The up trend just started.

I can only imagine how much work and effort you poured into this project. On behalf of all those less fortunate and unable to post - I give humble thanks. 
The Pineapple Fund has shown that philanthropy and Bitcoin do make a fine fellowship. 
Thank you Pine

That's a philosophical question, people need living wages. No matter what the currency it has to be enough to cover the essentials. 
If that were to happen i think we will need several different Coins. I think crypto would follow current global patterns. Individual coins for each state. However if there was only 1 coin and it was BTC - an estimate in M3 level money there is something like 75 Trillion dollars of spendable money on the planet. 
if Bitcoin (fully mined) replaced all the money in the world as it new single global currency then - 
1 Bitcoin would be valued at 3571428.5714285714285714
1 BTC = $3,571,428.57

It’s a nice thought however Did you check pricing ? It costs between 1 and 4 million USD per year. 
If you did pull it off you would have made the most efficient bitcoin miner of all time. Which should be part of the message. “ this sign is mining 2.5 bitcoins per week!” 
This is an expensive city.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:53:39
No apology, ur original thought was funny. 
this is an encouraging sign. But at this point i am not alone in grasping for anything. I am Going to keep on mining even if i go to --100% of electric costs.

No matter what fate befalls Bitcoin, Blockchain will be used in the future. i can foresee a world powered by the chain taking our technology to the next phase of evolution. It may have started as money but it is critical Tech for everything autonomous. Allowing machine to machine value exchange without human interaction is going to be foundation for much tech to follow. 
1. Meter readings - your electric, gas water all use meters. With blockchain those reading will be sent in real time to an secure ledger. eliminating false readings. making real time billing possible, and helping to identify outages. Instantly. 
2. Autonomous cars - AI to AI payments can be conducted without human interaction. your self driving car will drop you off. drive to a parking lot and recharge its batteries while you are not using it. the car will be able to pay the meter automatically. 
3. Personal item ownership - all hardware / items and merchandise using the BC in the future will be easily traceable to their rightful owners. Eliminating the value of stolen items. enabling easy of returns / exchanges / repairs.
4. Car / auto maintenance using BC will become permanent unalterable. the full history of that vehicle will be known. every oil change, every tire chance , inspection and crash. 
5. Black box technology - cars, planes etc using real time BC technology will actively upload all sensor data to a BC, when needed this data will give instant information that will assist investigations. 
6. Tickets - subway , concert, rail etc. Tickets stored on the blockchain can not be forged, are readily available for check. cannot be lost. no more metro card - just walk on to the subway and your phone (or other device) will ID your BC address. easing congestion and saving time. 
7. AI Accounting - It is not a good time to become a corporate finance specialist. This will be automated with AI and BC. Google : KPMG Blockchain 
its not the obvious applications of blockchain technology that should excite people. its all the applications we cannot begin to imagine yet.

How about creating a series of forks called 
Bitcoin Crash
Bitcoin Cush
Bitcoin Coin
Bitcoin Cesh
Etc diminish the name value of Bcash. 
That would, at the very least, make That pricks  Head explode. Like his mail
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:04:16
It’s reason to exist it to crush and exterminate Bitcoin.  To confuse new people looking for bitcoin into Bcash. 
Every tactic they use is to confuse and overtake Bitcoin. The domain name. The /BTC subredit. 
Its disgusting

So that Roger and his side kick Bitman can rule Crypto. He is that little prick kid who, when kicked out of the sand box for being a dick comes back and destroys the toys in attempt to ruin everything. out of spite.

We are still in infancy. I Suspect many chains will eventually be taken over by AI - another emerging technology. That along with Robotics.
