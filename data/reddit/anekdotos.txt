A tool is only as good as ~~it's~~ its user.

VMWare Workstation / Player, VitualBox, or Hyper-V (If you have Windows 8/8.1 Pro it's built in to the OS - you can enable Hyper-V in the "Turn Windows features on or off" settings)

As far as I can tell, that doesn't have anything to do with the CAPTCHA.  It looks like that, for some reason, the SilkRoad was serving up the response from a PHP file that contained:
    &lt;?php
        print_r($_SERVER);
    ?&gt;
Which will print server information.  It could have potentially leaked the public IP of the SilkRoad FrontEnd server which could in turn lead the FBI to Ulbricht.  But I can't tell... all the information is redacted from the original post.  It could have been nothing, a mistake on Ulbrichts end, or that someone else had some sort of access to the server. The information that it revealed would be useful information to someone wanting to hack the server, so it could have been a hacker as well. 
Wish I could give a more concrete answer.

To simplify things, you have: Client Browsing SilkRoad -&gt; Tor -&gt; SilkRoad Front End Server -&gt; SilkRoad Backend Server.  The configuration file provided was for the backend server.  In that configuration file it explicitly only allows IP's 127.0.0.1 (Which is the loopback IP, so itself) and 62.75.246.20 which is the front end servers IP.  
This means that ONLY the SilkRoad front end server can communicate with the back end server.  The article states that, "...but the document the government released in 70-6.pdf shows the rules for serving the Silk Road Web pages, and those rules are that all content – **including the login CAPTCHA** – gets served to the front end server but to nobody else."
This implies that the CAPTCHA was hosted on the back end server, making what the FBI claim to be impossible* (See **EDIT2**)
As someone still in university for computers, if Ulbricht set up the CAPTCHA the way the FBI implies he did (on a public server open to the regular internet) then he really wasn't trying to hide who he was.  It would be an extremelly stupid move; one that you pretty much have to go out of your way to do. 
**EDIT:** Here's some more conversation on this article: 
**EDIT2:** More information that I didn't notice could potentially provide some weight behind the FBI's claim:

Autocorrect :)
Which I suppose is fairly ironic given the quote.

I must have been editing my comment as you were posting this.  I updated my post with further information.  Thanks!

Ah! I haven't even heard of that site.  Just looked it up and it's already added, though.

Seriously.  People are so butt hurt about you testing out a site before you even knew it was a scam site.  You lost the BTC equivalent of $0.90.  Boo-hoo.

Accidentally go to a website that's malicious and... oops, buffer overflow exploit where arbitrary code can be run. [1] Doesn't even have to be a malicious website. Maybe some ad server that's linked to Reddit ads gets hacked and now you're being served crafted resources from what should be clean ads. (Hypothetical, but completely plausible [2]) 
That's one possibility. Just look at the security updates for Safari [3] or any internet connected service.  You'll find multiple CVE's being patched, some serious, some not so serious. 
This **is not** exclusive to Apple (Hell, I'm writing this from my MacBook Pro - I don't have anything against Macs), but if you think just because you 'disabled' your root account, and don't have remote access enabled that you're 100% immune... then you're just being naive.

Yeah, I'd be very surprised if it's not gone.  When you "delete" a file from the HDD, it doesn't really delete it, only the reference to it.  In addition, it marks that location on the disk as writable.  So as you use your computer, and as it reads and writes from the HDD (just browsing the web will write to the HDD), then it could potentially overwrite that file.
Sorry man, it looks like you might be out of luck.  In the future, the first thing you do when you realize you deleted a file that you absolutely need from the Recycling Bin is to do a hard shutdown (Literally unplug the computer).  Then boot up in a Linux OS and [dd]( the HDD to another location.  
At that point you can do all file recovery tasks on that dd image. dd does a block-by-block copy of the source HDD.

How long has it been? Run Recuva and see if you can recover it.  If it's been too long it might have been over-written.  If that's the case you're pretty much out of luck.
