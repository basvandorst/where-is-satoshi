The guy that wants to print more USD doesn’t want us to feel like we have an alternative.

This kind of gendered care scenario is too common.
@_date: 2019-07-24 09:36:16
Yes actually. I think it’s quite healthy if we are hoping for it to ever get to 100k and beyond.

^ this. you guys have earned a lot of loyalty. really sad to see JD and DD go.

If you were forced to share your bribes equally with everyone ;)

Totally agree. I'd rather not have r/bitcoin be about ridiculing or name calling people we disagree with.

What! I want to be an expert

Here's a comment from r/btc which I think is fair 
Lets not give up on figuring this shit out.

What I think is really at the heart of this issue is that we talk about how we talk. It doesn't have to be warm and fuzzy, but lets embrace and encourage rational discussion.

Totally agree. If it's as wide spread and potentially destructive as is being reported then it says a very bad thing about the creators of that product no matter the why.
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:22:16
Thank you for explaining this. It's been so hard to understand what the rational/history behind either argument is based on reading both r/btc and r/bitcoin.

I'm all for more women in bitcoin and for being less shitty to each other, though it's a little regressive to assume gender dictates behavior. I'm 100% into having an increasingly diversified group of people engaged in the community.

I still have mine (can still use it for music making but I rarely do)... but we had the monochrome monitor which I believe sacrificed color for higher resolution. Though this meant I couldn't play a lot of the games.

If there's a campaign it's to create fighting between the two groups. If we act out in anger against our fellow bitcoin enthusiast then the campaign has won.

Always love watching Dooglus cut through the bullshit in an argument.

I think it might be just about time to buy back in. Been through this cycle twice before.

That dog bought mid 2013. He fine.

just incase anyone hasn't seen the details about [robocoin](

You can't be like Mr.T without gold! Imagine him pitying fools with some bitcoins around his neck. Preposterous!

i get that they are south african, but i'd like to see (in general) more people from varied demographics be interested in bitcoin.

hurray for actual tax advice. any idea how this applies to other countries such as canada?

just-dice.com - 1% house edge, really well run, provably fair. you also have the option to invest as the house. but its just dice and no cards.

i feel very desensitized to all other marine life after watching berathea(nakowa) wager 1.6 million bitcoin over 14 hours.
i like to surf in the wake of whales by investing &amp; divesting.

what was the price when you used it?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:01:06
