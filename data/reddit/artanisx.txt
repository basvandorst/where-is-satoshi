You subscribed to WPD, because it kept reminding you that being dead is not normal and that you should try and keep you from being dead.
If it weren't from it you'd be dead by now?

Thank you, kind sir!

This is my interpretation as well. Obviously Nvidia cannot deny the fact Mining is a factor (they stated multiple times they can't meet demand), but they aren't catering specifically to it (if they were, they would've announced new specifically made mining cards with no video output, for instance).

Thank you for your detailed ansawer :-) I was interested in buying a Ledger Nano S, but since it doesn't support all coins I would want to store there, I'm a bit unsure. In the end I probably will buy it anyway! So... I'll hold on on opening a bitcoin node. It loooks like it's a bit too much work to have similar security than Electrum (provided no malware installed on PC of course)!

Drive, don't reddit and bro. That's like worse than broing and redditing.

20k tomorrow: impossible.
100k by june: unlikely.
10 mil by 2020: who knows? :D

I was thinking of preparing a node myself since I have a miner rig (only one card, actually a regular 24/7 windows PC) with spare HDD space. I was wondering, though, I could use it for my own wallet instead of Electrum and... just contribute to the network, right? Nothing else?

This is beautiful! We need a way to give reddit BITCOIN instead of redding gold!
