About 1 hour. But mostly because I had to wait for the watercolor to dry before using the ink.

If anyone was interested, I'd be willing to make and sell similar works. I love this community!
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:23:19
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:18:05
I agree.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:04:25
We think alike internet friend.

Send me yours. But to be honest it's whatever.

Just a few right? lol
Yeah, you're right though if BTC scaled to that demand it would use more power.
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:25:10
Good idea! I will definitely include a read-me.

My gut says buy.  I feel like it could be a whale setting up sell orders for an upcoming bull-run, but just a feeling.

 Hey now, we're not mining out here lol. But I also heard that the whole of btc mining uses less energy than visa.... is this true?

I need to come up with a good riddle too. This festival is an environmentally-conscious music/art festival nestled in rolling hills and forests,...

Interesting idea.  I wonder what they might invest in? Whatever happens here, this is the first time I've been aware of a move like this since I've followed the crypto-sphere. Pretty exciting whatever the outcome.

Geez, I finally made it in the .1 club... I'll go ahead and invest my school refund that should go to rent...  aha!

Haha. This is a collaboration.  But yes i am reaping the karma for the team.

Oddly enough they were purchased from Wal-Mart.  We just made up the QR part.

It will not be lost. If the recipient does not care and doesn't claim it before 30 days we will recycle it for future projects. We are out here trying to spread mass adoption, got a better idea? We'd love to hear it!

They just have to move the BTC into their own wallet, and then it's really theirs. We are setting up a site to educate people on the basics with a short how-to.

I am not personally giving These to young children, I will only corrupt kids old enough to understand.

Drop by anytime! 
@_date: 2018-10-29 04:13:56
No problem.  If they don't move them in 30 days or so,  we'll repurpose them. After all,  we can see if they've been transferred or not, and transferring them to their own wallet is part of the learning process they MUST go through to retain the BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:15:49
 exactly.  They have to move the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:18:27
 To keep the btc they must move it to their own wallet.
