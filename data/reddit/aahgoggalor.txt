You could use JoinMarket. It lets you tumble your coins yourself and is the best choice for privacy. The only downsides are it is difficult to use (there might be a GUI for it now I think) and it's recommended that you use your own node.

IFTTT.com can do this with the Chain channel. It can send an email, a notification right to your phone, or flick your lights on and off when there is a transaction send to an address.

I have just started using Coinkite's API after searching a bit for a good API for what I needed. It is secure and relatively straight forward. The hardest part is signing the endpoint with a timestamp but they provide code to do that.

I have to say this, I have to say this. He hit my blockchain, nobody has ever hit my blockchain, I've never heard of this one. Looks at this blockchain, is this a small blockchain? And he referred to my blockchain, if my blockchain is small then something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee it.

I was going to post the same question then I realized Slush Pool sent me a transaction that is waiting on a huge chain of previous transactions to confirm. Hopefully it will be confirmed in the next week or two...
