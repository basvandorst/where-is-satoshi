That is ridiculous. According to the Internet and Google "bitFlyer Inc. specializes in Bitcoin marketplace and settlement. The company was founded in 2014 and is based in Tokyo, Japan." Please take note that Bitcoin itself appeared for the first time and was launched as an open-source, peer-to-peer project in 2009. bitFlyer Inc. was founded in 2014, so it has no right to claim Bitcoin trademark.

I need this feature for a specific kind of service for my customers to secure them from bitcoin price volatility. I act as an escrow service. People pay my customers in bitcoins, they are deposited to my BTC wallet and I need to exchange them instantly for USD. As soon as funds may be released to my customers (even after a month) I need to exchange USD back to bitcoin and payout my customers. Now you get it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:44:04
Thank you for your response. What do you exactly mean?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:14:26
So how a service like Expedia or Airbnb for example may payout hotels/rentals owners BTC after a successful transaction? Let's assume a hotel owner wants to receive bitcoins for renting their place via Airbnb. Airbnb accepts bitcoin payment for a booking/rental from a customer in February and after a customer's visit in April Airbnb wants to payout bitcoins to hotel owner as soon as an owner submits a withdrawal request in April but the price of Bitcoin dropped or rose suddenly. The only way for Airbnb to make a payout to hotel owner is using an instant BTC-&gt;USD exchange upon customer payment and an instant USD-&gt;BTC exchange upon hotel owner's withdrawal request. This is the most honest way.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:32:03
But what if price of bitcoin falls $2,000 USD in a matter of hours? If a customer pays in February 0.1 BTC/800 USD (1BTC=$8,000 USD) for an apartment rental in April (1BTC=$6,000 USD) a hotel owner will loose a lot of money when he will be able to withdraw that amount of 0.1 BTC/600 USD from Airbnb in April. That's a loss for hotel owner. If Airbnb charges hotel owner 25% for every booking an exchange fee (BTC-&gt;USD and USD-&gt;BTC) of 1-3% is not a big problem.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:47:34
Thank you for your kind and fast reply. I know that Coinbase used to offer an instant BTC/USD exchange before migrating their merchants accounts to Coinbase Commerce platform, but unfortunately funds converted to USD were automatically sent to a bank account the same day. I need to keep my USD funds on an exchange's USD wallet to be able to trade them later back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:16:24
I don't get your point. How Airbnb fools a customer when it decides to instantly exchange BTC-&gt;USD on payment and USD-&gt;BTC on withdrawal?
If Airbnb decides to instantly exchange BTC-&gt;USD and USD-&gt;BTC, both hotel owners and customers can not loose anything.
If Airbnb DOES exchange BTC-&gt;USD and USD-&gt;BTC and keep hotel owner's balance only in USD and make payout withdrawals in BTC:
- Hotel owner does not loose when price of bitcoin FALLS.
- Hotel owner does not loose when price of bitcoin RISES.
If Airbnb DOES NOT exchange BTC-&gt;USD and USD-&gt;BTC and keep hotel owner's balance only in BTC and make payout withdrawals in BTC:
- Hotel owner looses when price of bitcoin FALLS.
- Hotel owner gains when price of bitcoin RISES.
So your points regarding my issue are meaningless. You are nothing more than an idyllic bitcoin believer.

You should list your business on [Bitcoin Merchants]( directory. They are free.

You may add [bitcoin merchants directory]( in the sidebar under the "Where to spend bitcoins" button. Wiki Trade has loads of businesses that no longer accept bitcoin and guys from Bitcoin.Travel impose a verification process on every business owner willing to submit business. BTW. Bitcoin Wiki trusted users should mention [Bitcoin.Travel]( website directory somewhere at the top of the [Wiki Trade Page]( to entice business listing verification and provide the community with a reliable source of information about merchants currently accepting bitcoin.

This also keeps the listings of businesses currently accepting bitcoins updated. It is pretty well positioned on Google on phrases such as "bitcoin directory" "bitcoin hotel", "bitcoin restrurant","bitcoin merchants" and "bitcoin itself". It also has Google Page Rank 4. It's been in the community since I remember and Bitcoin.Travel team frequently provides the whole bitcoin community with information about new businesses accepting bitcoins via [Facebook]( [Twitter]( and [r/bitcoin]( itself. Unfortunately it lacks of few places. Everyone can post any place, but their verify every listing. Bitcoin.Travel tend to verify every listing submission on their site before they publish it. In order to have one's business published on this directory, it requires an information on a publisher's website or business place that tells it's visitors that it currently accepts bitcoins. Guys from BitcoinTravel team are doing a great job, but businesses need to be willing listing their places in order to be visible in the community.

Bitcoin is already a huge success. I don't understand people questioning this and those who doubt in the greater adoption of this system. We only need to wait untill programmers will develop appropriate and easy to use tools and merchant solutions. Bitcoin need to stabilize and get into peoples minds that cryptography, math and bitcoin protocol is unquestionable and reliable. More reliable than trusting people and banking institutions. To make this happen we need to avoid glitches like forked blockchains. If for the next few years nothing like this will happen and bitcoin infrastructure will be unquestionably infallible, people will no longer bother about the technical aspects of how bitcoin work and care only for the convenience of its usability. Likewise in case of our current economic system, people don't know how this whole fiat money bubble work, but they use it, bacause it's easy and convenient. They don't really care about all those magical tricks that bankers do, which are in fact more complicated than bitcoin protocol itself. I guess for average person it would be much easier to understand how Bitcoin works, than to apprehend how current fiat money-based economy really works.
