I laugh when I see these headlines because I think the same thing.

It should motivate him to get back in and heavily but strategically invest, because he especially sees the future in this.

Don't try and compare it's growth to the growth of previous markets like mass adoption of television and computer. Since the invention and flourishment of the internet, mass adoption curves are becoming narrower and narrower. Think about the adoption of the smart phone, didn't that seem like it happened overnight?

Unless I missed it, I believe they have yet to truly prove that the tether is legitimately backed 1:1 buy the USD.

hmmmm I disagree with it being FUD. There is clearly some sketchy stuff going on with Tether and Bitfinex that is concerning even the most seasoned crypto traders.

And what about reporting captial gains on the BTC your converting back to FIAT? Do you have to wait an entire fiscal year before withdrawing? What if you made your first BTC investment over a year ago but have been continually adding to it throughout the year and making profits on those investments?

You are optimistic and have the vision. A lot of people think they have the vision but are truly only here for what they think is a cash grab.

I am interested in this but how do you calculate your profit earnings from Bitcoin in order to report your capital gains? I've wondered if my investments were to grow substantially enough to buy a house within a year, would I be able to withdraw that cash to make a payment without tax penalties?

but isn't the point to keep that 25k in there even longer so that it can turn into 225k?

It is scotch, from Scotland.
And if you have never had a cigar and glass of scotch on the beach you are missing out. Don't get me wrong I drink mostly refreshing alcohol on the beach but a scotch and cigar is a magical treat for me.

Bank transfers are very quick, almost immediate. You can also trade USD deposited for BTC right after the funds are posted, however you must wait the 4-5 day confirmation from your bank that the funds have actually processed before you can move that BTC into your wallet, another exchange, etc.
A little timeline of my experience with Gemini:
* 5/25/17 - Set up account
* 5/31/17 - Account Verified (felt like it took forever)
* 6/1/17 - Deposit USD 
* 6/1/17 - Bought BTC with USD
* 6/7/17 (a few hours ago) - Bank Transfer Complete (It says funds are now available for withdrawal from exchange but I tried to send it to a wallet and they are still locked. I am going to check in the morning.)

I used Coinbase for about 6 months back in 2014, and logged back in May. I forgot my password and had to do a retrieval and they made me re-verify my ID and send proof, no big deal right?
Well I waited a week before I sent them an email but they only responded to me with automated emails about the influx of traffic and that they would get to me as soon as possible. Three weeks and three automated emails later I was finally contacted by an employee and informed that my case was being transferred to a 'subject expert' who would complete a review of my purchasing eligibility. 
Overall the process was only about four and a half weeks, which is understandable for the amount of traffic they probably dealt with in such a short amount of time, but it was very frustrating to get absolutely zero human interaction during that time. It forced me to explore other exchanges which I am happy with.
