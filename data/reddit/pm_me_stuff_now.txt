Same here... the constant “why don’t you just sell like half”
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:01:23
Exactly my parents are 56/54 and I have 2 kids.. they don’t get or trust bitcoin still though
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:02:12
I’m pretty sure that $25 bucks is meant to just go pick out your own present, not save for 100 years...
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:50:31
Still isn’t a dip if there was never a decline but I’m not unhappy with the current price.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:09:30
I wish I would have just done the eh why not back when they were so cheap. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:35:40
So buy some eth?
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:37:31
Did you mean 3700? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:51:16
You really think eth is going to rise that much? I'm only in for 150 bucks right now but might get 50 or so in eth this coming pay day.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:06:39
Wouldn't you want to sell then buy back in on the turn around?
Edit: I've only been in the bitcoin game since it hit 3200
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:11:26
I cannot wait for a big dip. I just got in after it hit 3200 and if it were to drop under 3000 or 2500 I am gonna be scraping everything spare penny I can find to get more in before the next take off.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:22:25
Beginners questions but do you have to buy a whole bitcoin or can I spend like $50 bucks a week on it?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:04:03
I didn't know what eth was until very recently.. I remember like 5 years ago a friend saying he was mining for bitcoins and I kinda laughed it off and am majorly regretting it now.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:50:19
That would be awesome tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:33:20
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:45:52
Gains are gains dude.. I just got in when it was $3050 and have only been able to put in $580 between then and the 5k mark and it’s almost tripled in value which is small to some people but huge for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:19:14
How is buying at an all time high considered buying a dip?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:39:23
It is a 100% authentic replica of a bitcoin sold for between 5-10 bucks online lol still a good tip
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:56:46
I'm not complaining but a nsfw tag might be needed here
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:45:28
I know the 5k had a lot to do with it but that wouldn't explain eth and ltc dipping over night from Friday to Saturday.. the common dip was more what I was looking to confirm so I know not to panic haha.. only been doing this about a month now.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:27:16
Is it common for slight dips like this to happen on the weekend? I kind of noticed it last week and really noticed it this morning when the big three were all down a good amount when I woke up.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:56:10
"Art work"
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:45:10
This is just vandalism.... not giving us a good look, plus I live in buffalo which makes me feel worse lol.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:13:06
To be fair nvidia has been soaring lately 
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:33:35
Ok hear me out I'm new and understand the dips but is it normal to have 5-10% dips on the weekend or does the day of the week have no impact on the timing of the small dips?
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:57:45
You can type in literally any business or the name of any company with scam thrown on the end and get hundreds of results of people claiming it's a scam because they either don't get how it works or don't like the company.
Personally I assume all online casinos/scratch offs are scams.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:45:15
4980.00 was the highest it's been...
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:59:09
35 bucks for a plan sweatshirt with a screen print word across the front?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:38:49
Possibly 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:29:56
That is the exact post that made me aware of bitcoin and got my to buy my first .1!
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:37:52
Premature dude....
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:53:24
Didn't know that.. didn't go to school there just live in the city
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:07:58
I'm working towards my first .1 lol wish I didn't miss the boat
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:48:06
The down gif should feature him grabbing coins and saying buy them up now while you can
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:01:52

@_date: 2017-09-27 11:15:29
You got what you wanted homie.. do another one for like 28k
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:17:18

Any suggestions of a different way to buy in New York State? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:24:12
Dude the same thing three times in a row and it’s terrible on all three
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:34:27
The increase isn't steep enough!!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:53:06
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:11:59
Nothing I guess..
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:33:15
I came here to say that heart is impressive
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:51:23
