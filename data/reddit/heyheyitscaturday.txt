Still overly complicated for what should be an extremely simple transaction - hand over cash, hand over drink, done.
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:04:21
Lol how are  people falling for this obvious troll?
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:09:49
Because that's a completely fair comparison right?
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:02:28
So this is actually good news?

There might be morse-code in the fingerprint

If it is what you think it is, the timing could be perfect - capitalising on the bad Bitcoin press (spreading exposure of the concept) to offer a reputable alternative (backed by google) 
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:47:29
Where's the current drop to $250?

It's the early adopters and current holders panicking in their own way and trying desperately to retain BTC's value, by convincing others "this is the best time to buy"
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:54:15
So this is actually good news?
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:37:17
But bitcoin isn't a credit line
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:42:08
March 2nd, 2014 14:00:00 $630 /BTC
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:23:36
Down talking future prospects of bitcoin established through personal research? Guess that's a downvotes from the community 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:49:31
Where can I sign up to be paid for this? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:22:29
Flawless. I'll go do this, then take my iPhone to the repair shop while I'm waiting on the Nexus to arrive

ITT: every contestant downvotes the other

"It didn't drop 50% in value overnight, so good actually thanks"
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:21:53

Looks like some of you got trolled into smashing a $700 piece of hardware
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:28:12
Love these stories that come out whenever bitcoin takes a hit. What happened to 80 year old Alfred? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:18:36
i love how while you were saying some redditor promised you a nexus7 if you broke your iphone you were obviously thinking 'wtf am i doing' in the back of your mind
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:22:23
No publicity is bad publicity? Really? In light of what just happened? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:27:14
This is hilarious, especially considering the arguments floating around that bitcoin gains should be tax exempt and the government shouldn't be involved at all  
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:02:19
$50,000 coins? Lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:29:57
So this is actually good news?
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:33:23
i hope this is a troll post
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:58:31
What are you bringing to the table other than the idea? Are you willing to pay hardware and software developers? Or just offer equity?
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:46:40
Nice 
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:22:05
