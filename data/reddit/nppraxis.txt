Sometimes, you bet on black, and it lands on black.

Wow.  I was thinking, "Okay, well, he's being stupid and gambling all his money and credit card debt at likely impossible interest rates for this, but he's probably a poor college student, so if he wants to be an idiot and be in debt for life or go bankrupt, fine by him."
But you are gambling your family too.

Not really.  The stock market is only gambling if you're investing large money (percentagewise) in single stocks.
If you're buying a range of stable, dividend paying stocks with your money spread out, you're statistically extremely unlikely to lose money in the stock market.  It's genuinely investing.
If you'd spread your money across ten blue-chip dividend stocks in 2007, and the market crashed, you'd still be slightly ahead today.  The S&amp;P 500 is back to where it was in 2007 now, and you'd have five years of dividend payments.
Going all in on a single stock is gambling/speculating.  And stupid.
Going all in on a credit card is gambling.  Odds are absurdly stacked against you when you add interest in to the equation.

If you were diversified, and *didn't sell your stocks*, you've recovered.  Check the S&amp;P 500.

Good speculating has a risk management strategy.

If the trustee can prove you wasted your assets deliberately, it can be grounds to deny you bankruptcy.  Pulling all of your cash to gamble can count.

It isn't even investing, it is ~~speculating~~ gambling.
