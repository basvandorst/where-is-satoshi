I know a couple of dancers who bought charms with cryptocurrency qr codes on them earlier this year in new orleans. Their club asked them to stop wearing them. Most strip clubs DISCOURAGE clientelle from whipping out their phones and taking pictures....making the qr code thing kinda shitty.   
Besides....who wants to wait hours or even days to get a lapdance?   
Guess the clubs could put in bitcoin atms if the demand ever grows enough to make it necessary.

too much rise too quickly  
Encourages short term investors  
If you hopped in a month ago cashing out with double your money may look pretty good....  
when the price starts to drop because of people cashing out others get worried that it will keep dropping and it drives the price down further as more short termers who lack confidence bounce.

I think bitcoin will end up being more like your savings account than your checking account. Visa/MC/Amex/Discover offer credit and a convenient and already in place payment network. If the credit card companies open their own crypto exchanges then there would be no acceptance curve. Long confirmation times would be inconsequential as the purchase would be buffered by the cards line of credit.  
I think even if btc xyzcoin visacoin or whatever becomes the norm the price of goods and your pay will still be expressed in terms of your nations currency

the bitcoin fee is what you would be charged FOR THE USE OF THE NETWORK. 
That doesnt mean that a restaurant is going to give you coinbase value for your BTC. Ever been to a bitcoin ATM? Im not saying that POS will tack on that much...but Bitcoins not stable...the price fluctuates too much and restaurants operate on slim margins AS MANY BUSINESSES DO....Businesses dont eat expenses...not the smart and successful ones...they pass them on TO YOU. Thats why this restaurant in questions charging YOU a fee...They got tired of paying.   
So yeah your missing something. You like so many here seem to be playing the same sort of BTCPancea that socialists and communists do with their political philosophies....swearing by a theoretical that has NEVER managed to prove itself functional in real world application.  
CRYPTOCURRENCY will surely replace fiat in time. BTC will always be the great great granddaddy progenitor of the field....BUT it wasnt ever intended, Isnt currently capable, and is not likely to EVER be able to handle EVEN a small nations economic system...LET ALONE THE WORLDS. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:30:24
missing something here?  
they are charging 3.95% if you use card....  
But not if you use cash....  
AND NO WHERE AT ALL DOES IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM ACCEPTING BITCOIN....because guess what? They dont...and if they did...theyd probably surcharge that as well if not for fees and hassle than to try to buffer some of their loss when their payments tumble in value before they get the funds into a real bank.  
Bitcoins great. Its not the solution for day to day spending. If you think it is, You dont get it at all.

lets say I have 100 bitcoins Im willing to sell...for the right price.....I want to see 10% profit so I place a sell order for 100 bitcoins at (whatIpaidX1.1)  
Today everyone laughs and says no way, Ill just buy some of these cheaper coins being offered.  
Tomorrow a bunch of people have bought up those cheaper coins....and someone who wants to buy coins has to buy ones being offered for more.  
As long as more people want to buy coins....and the people who have them ask more....eventually my 1.1Xpaid price becomes the cheapest coins available and my sell order will be fulfilled.  
If I put a sell order for 3x market....Im not going to make a sale for quite some time....but eventually...as prices rise...someone is going to pay that   
On the flipside.....If someone who has been mining a long time and has 1000 bitcoin saved....has some life crisis and suddenly needs money badly....they can offer those 1000 bitcoin at 75% of what current pricing is....and LOTS of people will start buying those up...which drives the average sales price....and the value DOWN.   
SO if you think the price of bitcoin is overinflated and will drop soon....place a big buy order for a low price....and if you are lucky youll snag up a bunch of coins when there is a hard drop.....if you are really lucky the price will rebound shorty afterwards and you will see your buy grow significantly.....   
or maybe bitcoin will be failing and your big buy will drop drop drop to no value at all.

you dont know how a ponzi scheme works do you?  
Do your friends who tell you to buy property make any money when you buy a property? I doubt they do.  
See a ponzi scheme works by taking LOTS of money from group A and partying your ass off.....  
Then convincing a group B that you are so successful that they give you money too....  
You then take a little of group Bs money and give it to group A telling them its their first return on their investment.....Then you party your ass off with the rest  
Now its time for group C to invest.....A and B get a lil money each and you blow the rest....   
Somewhere along the way it starts to get hard to party your ass off AND give groups abcdefg a cut....so you only give payouts to the largest investors and the rest get excuses...   
Until eventually someone finds out that there is no investment...the money is gone.   
So your friends telling you to buy property are just giving you advice based on their experience. They arent trying to scam you into their investment club.   
When you buy property you own something tangible. You have something you can hold or resell. Where many people make a mistake is to think of their home as an investment vehicle....I mean it is to a degree. But if you want to make an investment, multiunit rentals are a better place to stick your cash.
