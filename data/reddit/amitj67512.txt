Maybe you guys think I am wishing the worst for everyone but that is not the case here my friends, I just do not want people to lose money. The pain is not over yet if people are in for the long run they can take risk. But people who are in for medium to short term stay away!!!  I have been in the stock market game for a long time and I know how the market makers play the game, when hope rots and despair burns that is when they put their money.
