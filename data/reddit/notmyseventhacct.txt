Me to my cousin: 
"Hey get ready for a huge dip and get ready to buy"
1 hour later: wait what
1 hour after that: I don't understand anything anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:26:14
Yea if you're getting an app for your wallet, that should be the only thing you use the phone for. Not having a hardware wallet seems so sketchy to me though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:21
That's quite optimistic, but that would be pretty cool. 2018 would be insane.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:16:31
Sorry but I can't help with that, I haven't touched the little I have since I got it. I play roulette and that's more than enough gambling for me lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:35
I think there are a lot of buyers right now though. I've had 5 coworkers ask me *today* how to join bitcoin, and a few family members too
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:33:58
People on this sub usually say to just buy and hold. But things are crazy right now. I'm gonna hodl what I have, but not sure if I should just buy in now or wait for a correction that may never happen. I expected a drop today so there's that.

I promise you that they can't even be 50% sure

I'm thinking most of us are in the same boat. I don't know a lot about other cryptos, but I'm also worried that one might somehow replace btc. There are just so many now.

 &gt;1. Go to GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase account. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and it’s their platform for more technical people. 
 &gt;2. After you logged in, verify your account if necessary. 
 &gt;3. Press the “deposit” button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It’s free and takes only seconds.

I'm honestly so confused by what you're saying. 


What does this have to do with anything I said or even with anything you said?


The only thing I'm trying to do is explain to you that "get with the times" is a saying that implies something is typical / expected, and that receiving BTC as payment in lieu of USD is NOT typical / expected. What made you think otherwise from my comments?

Only put what you can afford to use, and forget about it. People buying during the all time high at 5k were thinking the same thing, and we're at 15k as I'm writing this.

We can't just expect the most viewed wiki articles to be the most important things in the world. There are far more important things than bitcoin and their articles aren't in the top 3

Hodlers don't panic sell
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:00:09
Saying "get with the times" is explicitly saying that it is not only normal, but  expected. Getting paid in BTC is neither normal nor expected. I never said whether or not I was against receiving a salary in bitcoin. Meanwhile you're trying to say it's a NORMAL thing and that everyone is getting paid in BTC, and anyone who doesn't see that is falling behind. Yet you acknowledge that OP is a pioneer because he does it. It's either normal to get paid in BTC, or OP is a pioneer. Pick one. 
nor•mal (adj) - usual, typical, or expected.
Please discuss this with me if you still disagree

@_date: 2017-12-02 00:02:49
Lol *get with the times*
Just because a couple people are getting paid in bitcoin doesn't mean it's normal

You're going to get shit on in this sub then, start with the sidebar. Get at least a BASIC understanding of what bitcoin is other than thinking it's a coin you buy for 14k. No one will invest for you. You need to save money and put into it yourself. But before you even THINK about that, start with the sidebar.

I never said buy the dip, I said don't buy during ATH. Stop thinking about BTC like gold or like the stock market. It's something completely new.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:04:32
What does bitcoin have to do with consumerism? I'm not trying to be a dick I honestly just have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:39:30
I think that's really hard to do and do well. I did this on paper about a month ago to see what I could do in a week and two weeks with .1 btc, and I only added about 4% to my btc (on paper). And I did pretty well when it came to predicting dips. I'm sure there are people that are better at it than I am, and if you're on a streak for a while you'll start to see big gainz. Just my 2 cents (0.000001 btc).
