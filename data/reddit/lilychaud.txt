What about: businesses that accept fiat vs businesses that accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:06:34
But what if you measure it against a basket of bitcoin?

There's a hole in the side that you masturbate into before you can purchase BTC.

I figured they were just weirdos who wear tinfoil hats and pay cash for everything cuz the government is out to get them.

You can do all of what you just said with cash.
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:20:17
Yes, and hardly anyone knows it exists, and even fewer people use it.

So everyone just wears a shirt with some kind of id tag in huge letters for easy anonymous reading?
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:55:49
Does it still work out to the same price in usd? Or do they charge a novelty fee?

You need a credit check to open a chequeing account? This actually blows my mind. Unless they are allowing you to overdraft your account I don't see why your credit score would matter.

You call the thieves dumb, yet say that if you hadn't bought the BTC yesterday, you'd have stored $1200 in an unlocked car.

4 half pints = 2 full pints
Maybe they had a special on half pints and it worked out cheaper for to bill you like that.

If you go to another country, you can exchange your countries cash for another countries cash quite easily.

Well if that guy didn't have low self-esteem before, he most definitely does now.

Banks make money by lending your money out. My Canadian chequeing account is $12/month for unlimited transactions. The fee is waived because I keep a minimum balance of $2000 on the account at all times.
I have a credit card that I pay off the balance each month so I never pay interest on it. It gives me 2% cash back on grocery and gas purchases, and 1% back on all others.
How is someone like you who has a decent job so fucking clueless about how banks work? You pay more than me in charges for bullshit items like money orders and cheque cashing fees.
If you don't have a bank account or a credit card how do you ever expect to build credit and get a mortgage one day?

Isn't a loadable debit card just a checking account?
