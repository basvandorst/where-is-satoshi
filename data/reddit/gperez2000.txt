But GHASH.IO is creating the negative side of the news too and it's affecting bitcoin. people that want to down play the issues GHASH need a reality check. It's hurting with bad publicity.

I hope I'm wrong but I really don't like what I'm seeing Manipulation written all over the place

IT's already GHASHCOIN

100% of the network in one hour, slapping the Bitcoin community atwill

30 Hours mining at P2Pool only got me .028B and at any other pool .087, How a miner can survive! wasted power. there is not support at all just people making noise but they don't do anything about it
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:04:40
10% only, Too volatile to put more.
@_date: 2014-07-27 06:07:01
Apparently that leave PPCOIN as the most transparent of the crypto coins out there.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:23:00
I agree

The possibilities of a 51% attack and the decentralization of the network hashing power has been the issue here. Ghash.io let their network go over knowing what that means to bitcoin and the community, to me that alone was an attempt to gain control over bitcoin to their advantage, no excuses. GHASH.IO is an evil pool period. I was mining there and left because Bitcoin it is the first people currency, run by the people and for the people and I want it to be a successful one.

It's about the fundamentals on what bitcoin was created a decentralized network.

Since banks and politicians don't know how to get (steal) your money thru the chain and they will see less flow to their pocket, Governments driven by big legacy business will try to ban anything out their control.

Bitcoin is in jeopardy thanks to greedhash 
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:59:17
I have 2TH and my electrical bill went from USD$170 to 634. Mining isn't profitable anymore thanks to the pools and the block for one design, the blocks should be shared with every single miner because they were part of the solving as a whole network.

If bitcoin fails  blame that to miners in that pool not GHASH.IO, they're greedy and they are betting for bitcoin to fail
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:52:19
The right way to go is eliminating pools altogether and every miner gets a piece of the reward. Giving the block reward to one while the others where part of it with their shares, it isn't a fair game. That will control the Greedy people like the GHASH, and GHASH is the least Greedy of all except for the CEX.IO that's all for them and nothing for the dumb who buys it.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:18:00
I feel you, because power isn't free and you'll have to double your hash rate to get the same as you getting now, wow insane
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:10:17
GHASH.IO is slapping the Bitcoin community big time

They use the equipment and then sell them for profit, manufactures are double dipping. LOL
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:32:24
What Hippocrates , they are trying to un law bitcoin  in one hand and on the other one they're trying to profit from it, double standard, that's why I had lost faith in the political system, governments are legalize capo's.
