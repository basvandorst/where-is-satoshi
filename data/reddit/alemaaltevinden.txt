And if it's not a printed currency its not real currency. It's a derivative or an IOU
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:36:24
Sure it can happen with bitcoin, there already are transactions off chain and the amount will probably increase. Anyway if it can happen it would actually be a reason for this article to be relevant cause then this could serve as a warning why everything should be on chain.
So if your opinion is that it can't happen with bitcoin then I have to repeat my question, how is this relevant?
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:39:52
Yes it is possible with BTC, it works the exact same except OFF CHAIN so not in the ledger.
Like off chain...
As in, not, I repeat, NOT in the ledger
You should start seeing a pattern.
Like, there is no ledger, because they do it offchain, like sometimes happens already.
As in, it's not in the ledger.
As in they can create it, using fractional reserve.
As in, not in the fucking ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:40:32
I don't have worries about fractional reserve I'm gonna go against the circlejerk here and call it a good and decent system. I also never said lightning networks, I was talking about services such as coinbase.
But it looks like KeavesSharpi seems to think normal banks can print currency or doesnt understand that companys like coinbase can create fake bitcoins the exact same way banks can create "real" fake currency.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:08:25
Banks can create money the same way on bitcoin as they do on other currency. By giving out money they don't have. They can't print it, only the government can. So what you are saying is not relevant.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:20:24
Yes, I know it so well I'd probably be able to program one from the ground up. So now, how is this article relevant to bitcoin?
I'm gonna go and guess that you think it is because with bitcoin you own your money yourself so you don't have to place it at the bank?
Well that's a pretty bad reason. Banks make money of loaning out money. That is still going to happen with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:32:48
Indeed. And this is possible using bitcoin too, just offchain as I said.

The hardware that isn't theirs isn't a problem in the first place so isn't part of the problem thus since it is no problem nothing can be a solution since solutions only exists if a problem exists.
A 51% procent attack takes time, if a pool owner is gonna try to do one with a pool of which he doesn't control the hardware he is probably gonna fail. Thus the only danger of ghash/cex.io is if they own a lot of hardware something p2pool doesn't solve.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:08:40

@_date: 2014-08-07 15:56:32

Miners who join in one pool are less of a problem than a lot of hardware joined in one person.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:14:14
The hash is not send to the server so the only reason it is a tiny bit less secure is because maybe it gets saved in your browsers history and it is visible on your screen.

I was thinking about bitcoin banks that make a private key for you and put it on a card like thing, but I guess all of that requires infrastructure that isn't gonna happen to Argentina first.
I do think the amount of smartphones is more important than internet penetration though. You can create an address offline, use an atm to convert your current currency or let your boss pay out to that.
Since it's your boss you don't have to worry if he paid you cause ofcourse he did, if he didn't you do exactly the same as if he didn't pay you "real" currency.
Then when you are with a merchant you ask him to use hes internet, I'm gonna assume that they won't mind that you use it to send a transaction to them.
Now you might ask what if you wanna check your balance or something, but if you don't have internet you have to go to the bank anyway so instead of that you just go somewhere they have internet.

@_date: 2014-06-08 11:00:59
First of all we were talking about a software switch that doesn't exists since there is nothing you can do about a 51% attack since the point of the blockchain is that you assume that more than 50% of the mining power does good.
So ofcourse once you go in a bit deeper it starts getting stupid but my point was that the miners aren't the ones that have the "voting" power, it's the merchants and the users, that was my only point.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:18:02
The problem is that a lot of people are touting while they know nothing. P2P pool isn't a solution at all. The sole, and I really mean sole problem is the hardware that they own.
If they were to try to pull a 51% attack with their pool and they didn't own a lot of hardware then the miners would quickly change to another pool.
The problem with them is that they own the hardware that people buy at cex.io. If you see that as a problem (which it might be, but you can't really say that without having more data) then p2p pools don't do anything to solve that problem.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:38:29
This one isn't about ghash.io and the hivemind of destroy/terrorize/kill them. It's a technical discussion of a pool owning +51% of the network so I didn't want to post it in one of the others. Who reads those anyway, they just get upvoted for their title.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:10:40
Problem? I wasn't talking about a problem at all, I was just saying that the clients hold most of the power the only counterargument is that attacking a network with a small amount of power is more likely but in all other ways, the clients control the protocol.

Well since you hate me and think it is negative to receive a 5 dollar bitcoin tip, please tip me I would really dislike it.
But in all seriousness I didn't say that what that guy did was good. For them to convert it to dollar will cost more in man hours than it gets them. And using donations and giving people stuff to spread a message isn't the best thing to do. But I forgive op cause the organisation that he gave to does the same but with relgion so fair is fair.

If you have 49% the chance of doing a successful attack are very very small if you use even a short confirmation time like 2 blocks.

They own the coin so they see to who they spend it. But after that it is kinda stupid so they could just buy the coin and then sell it and have the same information.

He probably meant how did he get the coins back.
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:16:17
Yea but 55-65% is a whole lot better than 36%.
So I don't think that is gonna be such a big barrier because you don't need internet to have bitcoins, merchants need it and atm's/banks would also need it but the average person doesn't perse need it to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:40:01
You need at minimum 50+% the more you have the faster you can do it. Here is a better explanation: 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:49:35
Ofcourse there is a problem with owning that much of the network, it just doesn't mean they can create extra bitcoins. It also means that your acceptance of bitcoins shouldn't be how they do it now. Since you just proved it isn't save to just accept bitcoins. You have to make sure it isn't someone with a lot of computing power. ;)
Also it has been worse than 51% already. Ask peperfridge farm, he knows of a time when someone had 100% of the network the good old days. It'll get better :)
Also no need to apologize, not everyone can be equally right.

If we make the term keylogger not only mean software that records your keypresses but extend it to mean software that logs everything (in this case communication to the internet) then a keylogger can get your wallet once you login to blockchain.
There are tons of reasons why it would take a hacker a month to crack your wallet. However I'm not saying that that is what happened. I just wanted to say that 2FA is just A way to secure something.
You have to look at it as locking your car with a gps inside. It makes it more difficult but if I smash a window I can still steal your gps.
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:01:21
Yes I know spreading a message that way is indeed a dick move. You shouldn't have an hidden agenda when doing good deeds. But op is forgiven cause the organization he gave to does the same.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:09:32
It is possible once all coins are mined for a good amount of time to say with a very big certainty if a bitcoin is real or not. That is simply not possible with the dollar because dollars aren't supported by cold-hard math but rely on being the "right" paper and the "right" ink. But both can be produced in such a way that there is 0 difference between a "real" dollar and a fake one.
For your doublespend thing. There are enough ways to ensure you don't get doublespend against. Waiting for more blocks for example. The change of a succesfull doublespend lower dramatically each extra block.
And for that central authority bullshit you keep repeating, even if they control more than 51% of the network it doesn't take away that fact that they simply cannot create new bitcoins thus no central authority can issue new currency.

It's not a 9 out of 10 chance to get ahead. Each block has a poisson distribution and you just have to see in how many of the cases the attacker has more blocks and in how many cases the good network has more.

I meant the merchants and the people who own bitcoins. Just everyone involved except for the miners since they are the ones that don't matter at all. Srsly they don't matter at all. They can run whatever software they want, it's the software that displays how many bitcoins you have that is important, the software running on the clients, the sofware run by the merchants, the software run by webwallets, etc. but the software of the miners don't matter shit.

That is not possible. What pools do is they do exactly the same as with the blockchain only with a lower difficulty. So yes you can do the attack in the OP but switching to another pool would probably be better. It also wouldn't be hard at all to detect. Just give multiple workers the same work every once in a while.

Well bitcoin is based on the predictability that if everyone own an equal amount of proccessing power the change of someone finding a block are small. The chance of finding two smaller, and so on. At some point the chance of finding X amount of blocks is so small that we can say it is so improbable that we see the chance as non existant. Therefor after X amount of blocks we can say that not one person will be able to make a second row of blocks that are as long as X + 1 therefor it is impossible (or at least highly unlikly) that someone can make a new chain that is longer and thus our transaction is permanent. 
If X becomes too large because someone owns a lot of processing power, then bitcoins become unusable and worthless. However in theory there will always be an X after which we can wait so that we can be safe from a double spend.
Satoshidice worked with an X of 0 or 1 (not sure) which is very unsafe and therefor easy even without 51% to doublespend against. They were kinda asking for it to happen.
Anyway it's not perse a problem if someone owns 51% of the network since it is in theory still safe if you make X big enough but it becomes less safe for smaller X's and thus less usable because it takes longer for a confirmation. Therefor it is in ghash.io it's own interest to find a solution. And a solution will be found by someone. Bitcoin is still very young and immature.

@_date: 2014-01-03 16:41:47
I'd say counterfeiting is creating money of which you can't tell the difference between real or fake. So I guess what I meant with non-counterfeitable is more that noone can create bitcoins while if you want you can create dollars if you get all the rights things like paper and ink.
No, it means that satoshi dice needs to fix their weakness and change their system. 
They won't be a central authority at all just because they own 51% of the network.

Bitcoin, Money of the future or most recent bubble?
Brussel - Will we be paying all of our erands with a piece of computercode or is the bitcoin one of the many internet-bubbles? Ever since the American Ministry of Justice and the stockregulater SEC have spoken about the bitcoin as a legitimite currency has the worth of the virtual coin skyrocketed. 
But was is a bitcoin? The bitcoin isn't a tangible money. There are no paper bills or coins, you can't get it from an ATM and you can't hide it under your mattress. A bitcoin is, like the name says, a piece of computercode, a coin that exists of bits and bytes. 
Then the article talks about how it is assumed the creator is Satoshi Nakamoto but we don't know who or what that is. 
They talk about the Belgian Bitcoinassociation (?) and how it was popular in Cyprus.
Then they say that bitcoin does for money what skype did for calling.
They mention you can't pay much in Belgium except for pizza.be but there are places where you can.
"A lot of specialists are sceptical against the bitcoin" and a few sentences about the vulnarability of hacking.
They then quickly talk about inflation very shortly after which they, also shortly, discuss criminal activity and anonymity.
All in all one of the lesser articles that have been in the Belgian newspapers.

This has nothing to do with dns...

What is the reason that the location has to remain unknown?

Hes calculations are off. Checking if an address has worth on it takes more energy than that he used.

Told a dutch forum about it:

And that is why you should ask companys to accept bitcoins.

Why did you link to the url to tweet your BTC adress?

No, the people who use the system have control over the protocol, if every service and business changes how they do stuff, the protocol changes.
If ever miner changes, nothing happens except that the security technically goes down a bit.

Maybe the fact that NDAs over the internet are unenforceable?    
The fact that he just wants it build instead of wanting the money for it?    
The fact that bitcoin itself is build on the principle of opensource?    
The fact that some people don't want to get rich of the idea, but instead of the execution?    
But even then, he is just giving out hes idea, there is no reason for him to have done any serious business in hes life.

"There are currently 182,076 of us!" on their website.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:39:41
I would like to remind you that there are 193 countries, not 1.
Your claim in  is in my opinion ridiculous. I really doubt many opensource projects ever had any NDA in their timeline.
Anyway I agree that the wording "believing in an NDA" is a bit strange, but assuming that someone who says that has never done anything serious is a bit of a stretch.

Actually more efficient miners make it less decentralized thus less secure, not the other way around!
Secondly you only need one miner to have blocks, so it still stands, those who use the protocol to transact and those who know how to change it are the ones with the decision power over the protocol.
But that doesn't take away that the change of an algo change is low, since there isn't much incentive to change at this moment.

Is it the sub, the people, the modes or the system, I think that is more the question.

That isn't what happened. She did the payment of 5K, then when the new day started send the remaining 2.5K

Because it's a stupid comment, you don't help by just having it on your computer.

Not a bad idea and they are more easy to rebuild, I'll give it a try.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:41:06
Meh, with a country or a continent that isn't that likely.

You don't have to download the blockchain to do that ...


By default you don't, by default you only use resources so you are actually doing the opposite of helping.

It's not hard to convince people that if they go trough apple servers every time for everything they do that that is bad. Convincing them that a closed system like they have now is bad is harder. So it would just be easier to get people to stop using apple stuff. I'm afraid apple isn't gonna do it.

I'm afraid I don't see your point.

The "lump" sum is part of the protocol, all inputs have to be spend so the client just sends it to a newly generated address.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:16:38
I can see it too, try doing a hard refresh (ctrl+R).

No, you would still be an early adopter.

The problem has nothing to do with bitcoins but with how localbitcoins handles their arbitrage.

Don't worry, you aren't selfish, just a slow learner.

Maybe you should post a short explanation of what you can see in the museum.
Or I'll just do it myself. Copied from their website:
The Museum of the Coastal Bend showcases the rich multi-cultural heritage Texas' mid-coastal region. The museum's purpose is to collect, preserve, exhibit, interpret, and educate using the history and heritage of the region.

I thought satoshi ad more than 1 million but less than 2 million and no transactions, why isn't he on the list? It can't be because it's outdated.

She did first initiate it, then waited till it was a new day and send the remaining funds, the seller got them both at the exact same time. Canceling it would be dangerous and it clearly states that if you paid anything, you should mark it as paid.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:56:42
Altough she could have done that, it makes no difference, the seller got hes money as soon as possible. There was no reason to use the time of the second payment if both arrive at the same time. the time of the escrow should have been honored.
