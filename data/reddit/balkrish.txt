Hey no, sorry I'm not interested in getting the private key
I want to work out how many coins as a estimate are basically DEAD. If you know and understand what I mean? 
Let's say some guy had a hardrive with 1000 BTC.  The hardrive is gone
Now we should NOT include those 1000 BTC in our 16.5m circulating supply, right? 
If we can see the public address and wallets, and THEN from these see if a wallet has 1000 BTC and there have been NO transactions since 2011/12 we can safely say and presume those 1000. Are DEAD and should NOT be included in the circulating supply.
Thanks

Is there info on e.g 
in 2012 X wallet had 100 BTC. 
The owner lost his harddrive 
Now those 100 BTC are DEAD and gone . Since 2012 there is been ZERO activity or movement in that wallet. 
Is there any info on that number too?

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:33:12
THANK YOU EXACTLY.  I just wanted to confirm and can't get my head around why people compare it to Gold.  
Yes its valuable NOW but surely in 2-3 years OTHER new technology WILL DISPLACE it. 
Thank you!

You right That's why I think Bitcoin should prove it on the SAME day. 
Then no more BCH, if BTC gets more tx

You right That's why I think Bitcoin should prove it on the SAME day to wreck thier publicity stunt. .

You haven't done anything special.... because it's outside London.  What do people similar to your age and job do IN LONDON

How and who will determine that? World hunger or homeless or cancer research? Which country.  Etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:54:19
I know and I agree, BUT if they DONT.  Then what should happen.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:41:25
Because  then there will *which charity* why a charity in US, why not a charity in France,. Why not support cancer?
 Is cancer more important or a charity for homeless people?  Etc 
Any charity's would simply dump them and sell them causing the price to crash

What would you recommend?

Is it possible to request to burn and send all 160k BTC to a burner address?
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:23:24
Can you petition or send the 160k BTC to a burner dead wallet? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:55:02
This is probably the next best idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:43:48
Well like I said in my post.  Ideally that SHOULD happen.  
But if it doesn't,. I don't want the shareholders to get the 160k,. I don't think the trustee should,. I don't think they should be auctioned OTC.  
Destroy them.  Problem solved. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:53:56
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:16:33
What happens if the courts decide the rest of the 160k BTC will be YOURs.  What will YOU do??
