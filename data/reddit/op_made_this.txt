Shitpost or not, everyone has their own moon.

...which half?
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:21:32
With me, yes. 
You better hope the next big dip comes with cheese.

Hi Sara,
My sympathies for your loss.
Regarding the thumbdrive. It's probably a hardware wallet, used to keep private keys safe. This private key is literally the KEY to his bitcoin.
You are going to get a lot of comments and advice in this thread. That's a good thing. Those in the know will help you with this.
BUT PLEASE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you give out any information of the following nature:
* A List of 12 or 24 words
* a Passphrase
* a PIN
* Any address that is a bunch of weird numbers and letters in a row.
It is OK to tell us if this thumbdrive has "Ledger" or "Trezor" written on it. These are just different companies and the way in which they work is a little different. 
We can help you with comments and feedback, but it is highly recommended that you do the following:
Read what advice is given below (This comment of mine included) , then wait until other users have confirmed the advice as well as upvoted the comment before you even consider going ahead with one of the steps. 
Also, don't even try to give this to a "trusted friend" or technician because they can remove coins from the device and you'll never know the difference.
Good luck! 
Again, this is just my take on it. Don't respond to this comment unless others confirm that it is not full of nonsense. (I don't need the upvotes).

I met some russian dude in 2017 who was working for Western Union. He completely dismissed bitcoin as a fad. 
I see he's now working for some or other crypto exchange.

Sometimes people still earn salaries with Fiat. :P 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:22:44
Care to elaborate? 
I'm guessing the date/price at which one invested also plays a critical role.

A couple of my mates day trade.
One or two of them made absolute bank but said they'd probably still have increased their worth by a comparable margin if they just HODLed, minus the stress and gambling risk.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:38:00
Yeah im cautiously optimistic.
Im looking forward to the future. Reminds me of how our math teachers always told us we wont have calculators in our pockets in the real world...

On the South African exchanges it's already sitting at $13,877 USD...or R187k , we're all waiting in anticipation for the R200k figure (14,8k USD)
EDIT: R198,900 12hrs after my initial comment.

You're entirely right. People often say "That guy must be kicking himself now". 
The problem with that statement is that he could've just replenished his bitcoin holdings with a few dollars the next day. 
So in truth he shouldn't be kicking himself any more than everyone else in the world who didn't buy 10,000 btc the same day as he spent it. 
He didn't pay 9m USD for 2 pizzas, he paid whatever the price was that day.

I think you need to improve your methods with some kiara shading...

Today it also passed the R120k ZAR mark.

I was reading on twitter (take it with a pinch of salt) that only 300,000 addresses have at least 1 full BTC stored. This makes the 21M club effectively 70x smaller. 
Most folks I chat to now about bitcoin usually say "well the gains period is over, too expensive to buy in now." That was when the price was $3,500...

To keep it simple, I can imagine people maintaining the FIAT currency label on things but just like today you're saying "It costs $20, would you like to pay cash or card?" ... later on it'll be "It costs $20, would you like to pay by cash, card or bitcoin wallet?" 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:42
Oh cool! TIL. Thanks for the correction :).

There's a meter of snow all around the property, it's just that the heat from his BTC mining rig in the basement has melted everything in a 30m radius.

"...then stocks"

Dude had 4 months to do it. 
Same goes for people's reactions when BTC hit near 20k: "I wish it would drop back down so I could buy more".
And when it did, almost none of them bought because "the bubble burst. I'm so glad I didn't fall for this scam."
