Yes.  Do you like the fact that companies can disable your access to things you've bought and downloaded through them?
The Blockchain could remove any need for invasive DRM, since you could prove you bought it and therefore play it on any of your devices freely, or download it again freely.

All mobile phone networks work on the same infrastructure and technology, same with everything else you mentioned.  Except currencies which all have their own rules etc.  Bitcoin can fix that.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:15:55
What's your point?  Bitcoin has rules too you know.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:48:15
Absolutely agree.  Except we don't need a big company or corp.
They can use Bitcoin.  They just need to know about it.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:37:12
Bitcoin *is* the blockchain.  Bitcoin*s* are the currency, which is just one thing you can use the blockchain for.

I also get constant ads on facebook for Western Union.

Ah well, just got the e-mail.  Thought people would want to know.  Didn't see duplicate link warning.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:42:12
What exactly is the difference?  Oh, yeah.... US uses drones and missiles instead.
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:00:54
I think you think I'm a noob or something.  I'm well aware of bitcoins/Bitcoins/blockchain/Blockchain.info

Do gun sellers get arrested if they sell a gun to someone who they know is likely to commit a crime with it?
Serious question, I have no idea.  If so, then the law is consistent and fair.
@_date: 2015-08-15 00:10:10
Yes, it should still say "we MUST restart now, please save your shit" etc.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:51:45
I assume people aren't laymen here, we don't need to dumb things down.  Bitcoin is the program, how about that?  Bitcoins are the currency in the program.

Last time I bought about a month ago or so is the only time it hasn't fallen within minutes of me buying. haha

I like testing this on my twitter account.  I rarely use it, and for nothing important.  I log in once every few months or something.  Almost every time there are spam messages on my "timeline" or whatever it's called on twitter.  I usually use single words, or a single word with two numbers.
@_date: 2015-07-25 12:32:31


Theoretical, right? No one's actually done it?
@_date: 2015-07-23 21:52:03
He means only you know the private keys.  But that doesn't means anything if the private key isn't connected to your identity.
@_date: 2015-07-25 12:36:37
It gets sent to other addresses in your wallet, not random addresses or destroyed.  It's only a problem if you don't back up your wallet which has that new address.
And you can specify the same address for change if you want, even with blockchain.info you can do that.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:06:00
Very cool.  Bitcoin definitely needs improvements for scalability.  This is a very interesting initiative compared to altcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:33:55
Wow fallen price, such low value.
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:15:09
Just get a $25 RasPi and instal bitcoin-qt.  Chuck a HDD on it and you're done (after it syncs).  Really not difficult, and you know it's set up right etc.

Should allow them to put QR codes on there.  I was just gonna tip a couple bucks to hotgirlforyou but realised I had to sign up etc. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:49:39
They should have rather conducted a controlled demolition of the banks/tower.
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:47:09
oh ok cool.  Oh well, moved on now lol  Not really interested in cam sites.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:20:49
Same reason I didn't buy on overstock.  Was cheaper to buy a similar product in Australia.  Which is fucking rare.  In fact I've never seen something cheaper here than online, even with shipping.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:02:31
lol i tried mining early on and the pool just never gave a payout.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:15:55
But mostly down.
@_date: 2015-07-26 10:34:02
I don't get what you mean.  If you import a paper wallet address in to blockchain.info you can send the change back to the same address or one of your other addresses.
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:55:50
Nope.  Each amount you send is a separate input.  It makes sense if you think of the bitcoin as a transaction number.  1 sent this bitcoin to 2 (you).  3 sent this bitcoin to 2.  You want to send the total of both of those, you need to send both those transaction numbers separately (but the wallets do it automatically of course).
However you *can* just send without a fee, and hope it goes through eventually, and just consolidate them all in to one transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-13 03:26:26
Uh, I have no idea.
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:40:07
I love that I "made" money not even because bitcoin was rising (it wasn't for ages) but because our dollar was falling massively and I had my money in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:08:46
If you don't buy it through some site which has your details, it will be anonymous.  However I wouldn't trust any Tor node to not be watching/changing traffic going through.  I wouldn't do anything needing security over Tor, such as banking/bitcoin or anything with personal information really.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:13:20
I.... don't know.  Don't you just port forward on your router?
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:44:40
So about my current internet speed.  Australia will love this.
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:44:32
Miners can still reject spam if they want.  If they pay high enough fees, let them spam.
@_date: 2015-09-26 10:59:33
For a kid it is.  If they sourced all the parts themselves etc.
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:04:16
I don't know?  It's not up to the company to pay them, it's up to the company to declare it on the shipping box, customs to see it and then charge the customer taxes before releasing it to them.  I know people that import cigarettes all the time (coz ours suck now).
@_date: 2015-09-26 11:16:06
This is bullshit man.  You can import cigarettes from many legit companies in other countries, all you have to do is pay taxes when it goes through customs.  That's the only regulation in place.
