You mean $19,500?

IF you're only playing with $5k, then you haven't made $650, you've made more like $67.57 from the first trade ($200 is 1.35% of $14800) and $151 from the second trade (3% of $14900) for a total of $218.57. That is how you should look at your profits, as a % of your investment. If you had just held what you had bought at $14,800, you would have made $201.01 on the run up to $15,395. Is that extra $17 worth the stress of day trading?
And you definitely can "lose," even with limit orders. You could buy on what looks to be the low end of a dip when it starts to rise, only for it to turn back around and keep falling. Maybe it could take a long time for it to turn around and go back to your selling order. 
Maybe you could have a HUGE volume of buys that looks like a bull market like we did on the run to $19500 the other day, you buy thinking you'll sell at $20k, and it turns around and tanks and still hasn't gotten back. Suddenly you've bought at the high and you're regretting not having just held your initial investment. 
Right now it looks like BTC will still keep going up with some dips to me, but nobody knows. And sure, there's money to be made in day/swing trading, but there's a reason most people who try it out end up losing money.

I had the same problem back during the dip to $5600, totally missed out trying to avoid paying CC fees. Just eat the fees if you see a dip, things are so volatile that chances get missed in a flash.

I’m right there with you, should have just put it on the credit card and eaten the fee :-/
