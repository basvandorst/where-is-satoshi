I bough at 2k and still hodl (─‿‿─)

Do you mean the different addresses shown when you open receive bitcoin? 
As far as i know every address can be used multiple times
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:12
Ledger does give you every time an another address to sent to. But old address are still valid.
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:15:55
Means billboard just a paper board or a screen/monitor?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:51:36
if someone wants to do this: 
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:36:05
Ah good
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:25:29
yes i already checked my node on that website and its listed. "not send any outgoing connections": Do you mean with this that i send no blocks to others until i am fully synced?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:04:09
yay finally full synced :D
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:21:33
So segwit did increase speed by not just increase block size. The others did. So for me segwit is a better long time solution. Right?
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:45:27
So he can collect higher fee from normal users 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:36:26
Already did
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:20:41
so a connection is only used in one direction. outgoing connection --&gt; only receiving blocks? incoming connection --&gt; only sending blocks? And if it is so, why is a connection not bidirectional?
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:48:24
€ can move to different countries in eu you know?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:18:22
But with adding more tx in the block? So it makes sense to do it right?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:28:40
Ah good. I saw recently a diagram that showed we are at like 5% segwit transactions. Slow but steady grow ����
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:00:09
What YouTuber?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:20:57
Cloud miner that can the pool 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:56:22
great video. i love seeing people try to understand bitcoin from people that know bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:31:05
Right we had some ATMs but they got removed :(
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:36:22
I did write "not just"
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:27:03
Just correction as always
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:30:08
And I'm one of them
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:16:41
You can use this website to see how much transactions are before you with higher fee. The last diagram shows the tx in size:  
And the color codes represent fee
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:50:40
Same. But my morning is already 7 hours over D:
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:42:25
Well good morning :)
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:54:23
No, one bitcoin is 100.000.000 satoshis and one satoshi is the smallest unit.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:51:42
i know that but is one connection only used to send blocks in one direction or in both? because a connection could be used to send blocks in both direction no matter who did initiate the tcp connection
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:37:50
Makes sense thanks
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:13:17
that would mean
* 1btc = 1million$
* 1$ = 100 satoshi
* 1$cent = 1 satoshi
that represents very good the $cent
* 100$cent = 1$
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:20:45
After a restart and a little wait i have now 6 incoming and 9 outgoing connections again but still at 0.11% per hour progress. And traffic is still mostly 0KB/s and sometimes at 20KB/s shortly
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:38:35
Is the last halfing visible in the price chart? When was that? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:21:08
look the numbers in the black think up there
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:14:40
Hmm right that could be possible with a fork and if necessary almost everyone will agree to that fork.
Like when one coffee will cost 0.5 satoshi it is necessary.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:31:15
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:21:32
the ledger from original bitcoin will be also used in the new coin. Meaning at the time of splitting every address that has coins will have now both in the same amount. If you are in control of your own private key then you are fine. But if you hold your coins in an Exchange then you rely on that exchange that they will give you access to your fork-coins
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:42:40
The information for this could come from the exchanges but we can't know how much people have in there own wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:09:24
So does the halfing mean price up? Why?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:05:04
1: bitcoin was under 1$ when it started. one guy even buyed 2 pizzas with 10000 bitcoins.
But the demand did increase over time. The amount of bitcoin available is limited so the price has to increase. just like normal stock market supply and demand
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:21:37
yep i use blockfolio app and kraken as price source ....
i saw that B besides the price O.O
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:59:04
xD cool bot
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:25:31
Wtf again the logo of a German bank Ing Diba on something that doesn't belong to the bank
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:37:59
does that mean that a non segwit address can send to a segwit address? thx :D
i did not update to segwit address yet because i wait for Electrum version 3.
will be my old address upgraded to a segwit address or is that not possible and i have to send my bitcoin to a new segwit address?
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:36:26
the address your btc did go has the word "Thanks" in it. So it does not look like a software error. It is possible that a virus on your computer did that. for example keyloger while creating your new wallet
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:16:48
I did open the port on my router. But to be sure i just checked with your url and it says its open.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:01:58
2: the idea is that bitcoin will replace fiat currency. so you will use bitcoin to buy a house or a coffee.
3: a big bug error in the prtocol behind bitcoin, but after such a long time i dont think there is such a bug in there
4: we are currently at ~16 million btc from max 21million. there is a max value because we dont want inflation. the miners get the new created bitcoins for there work. after we reached 21million the miners cant get new bitcoins but they will still get the fees from the transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:51:13
oh nice. gource is awsome and already used it for my repos :D
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:32:03
no fail from kraken api
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:54:59
Cloud mining is also a option
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:03:29
i already did since start. thats why i have incoming connections.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:20:37
well check this:
