oh you got cash talk with this guy - 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:53:15
He already lost all his cred. People need to understand, it was a speculative investment for a reason. There are still some bugs to be worked out.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:40:44
I'd be worried it only bumped 300%, thats a lot of dough for a small bump
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:23:53
go talk to this guy 
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:41:52
Is this like that square company?
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:42:53
I live in USA, I buy Bitcoin through coinbase. 1% fee
I can send the bitcoin to my relative in India. 0.001%
He sells his bitcoin for indian cash. (unknown due unfamiliarity with India but guess 2-5%)
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:00:33
this session? bitcoin does not have sessions.

we would like to add a federal anti-terrorism fee. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:36:49
did she really bring up terrorism? is that really our biggest issue?
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:39:55
so you are saying terrorism is the biggest issue facing society right now?
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:35:30
Just send me you email and password we can sort this out. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:39:47
spend it fast - 
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:15:13
It is not inflation, it has to do with how many bitcoins exist 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:03:14
u r freaking out man - just chillllll
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:37:43
Thank you, do you know if this is the industry best practice? Are other crypto cards like this?
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:32:30
this is true, the coinbase transactions are complicated though.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:29:00
From what I understand it has to do with tipping. i.e. food, bars, 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:16:33
I use shift as well, Thing I don't like is every time you use it there is a over draft and then return of funds. Too complicated for me.
Also with the BTC economy HODL is a better plan than spend. i have bought some expensive beers with my shift card vs current price. :(

No such thing as a free lunch

Damn dude your are almost to the Moon
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:08:56
It's so bad it actually could be true
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:25
They are all decent, but nothing is for sure, gemini/coinbase are best for US but both are slow. Bittrex is good for russians. If you want control and ownership, hold your own coins. But then you have the user error problem. It is still the wild west-good luck
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:54:32
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:27:21
this is good... just don't expect much in moments of peak volatility and volume
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:22:59
@_date: 2016-02-02 04:57:53
sorry I guess I am looking at the conversion. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:28:19
How do you feel about the transaction costs and the withholding for the tip? I used mine quiet a bit without really doing the math but it seems a little high?
@_date: 2016-02-02 04:57:45
sorry I guess I am looking at the conversion. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:43:18
Right guys.... Who is with me.....  It's going be fine...... Everything is going great......
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:47
 until there is something to eat on the ground and he lowers his head
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:18:10
Thanks for the solid advice. I will not be selling any coins. The goal was to liquidate some owned coins. I'll sell through coinbase. The folks at said the same. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:20:56
are doughnuts really $0.35?
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:20:48
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:08:24
we still can not discuss the different devs of bit? what is wrong with discussion?
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:39:21
He probly lost his key 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:10:47
