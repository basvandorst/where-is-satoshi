I don't think China is shutting down Bitcoin in the longer term. Just a heavy handed response to the dodgy ICOs. The CPC needs to protect mom and pop investors. Middle class Chinese losing their savings would create unrest. They've been stung before.
Closing exchanges doesn't mean they will actually stop trading. I think it will just go underground.
Maybe the Party will just pick a winner and try to run a monopoly. I don't know enough about how the CPC runs markets so I admit this is a speculative claim. They do like to choose/build state-backed companies through creating monopolies and regulating out competitors in strategically important industries. Maybe this is that.
I do agree with you that this sub is terrible though. Memers looking for a get-rich-quick scheme. So hard to have a reasonable discussion here without "FUD", "shill" or whatever. 
I also think that the speculative value vastly outstrips the current utility of Bitcoin. I think this will change as time goes on. 
My reason for thinking this will change is that as the market capitalisation increases, the value will steady. That will make it more useable as currency alternative. The second reason is that I don't believe consumer use is a good barometer of take up. It will start with businesses who can deal with a 10 minute transaction wait. It's also a much bigger chunk of pie. Consumer is a long way off, but business use is not.
I also disagree with you that governments are entirely antagonistic to cryptocurrencies. I think the SEC ruling is fairly nuanced and correct about ICOs. I think they will move with the times and see the utility of coins (slowly and painfully but not entirely reluctantly).

I feel the same. If you're using Coinbase, you can transfer to GDAX for free. They charge much smaller transaction fees.
