Since people should be able to exchange USDT for US$, thether should have reserves to cover all USDT being converted back. 
The question isn't whether this is a scam, it's how big a fraud it will be.

It is a clinical use that is infrequent, which is much different. This 2007 story discusses the protocols
Also, most prescription drugs have side effects, many are more significant and treat less serious problems. Informed consent about possible benefits and tradeoffs is used here, just like in other areas of medicine.

Fourth possibility: They have received hundreds of millions of $ and issued USDT in that amount, but no longer have all those US$ in reserve to pay out for all the USDT in circulation. 
The Sept 2017 audit is here
It is concerning because the scope is limited. The auditor (top of p 2) says their charge was to confirm that the cash reserves claimed by the company were what were held by the bank and that the number of tethers was what the company claimed. With respect to the reserves, the audit report notes: "FLLP did not review the specific terms of the clients account agreements with the banks." This means that they do not really know if this is just a reserve to cash in tether or if it can be accessed for other purposes. 
On p 4, the report notes almost $61 million is in an account "in the name of an individual for the benefit of " tether. There is a letter laying out the relationship between the individual and tether, but the auditor "did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representations about it legal effect." Note 1 on the same page extends this to say there are no "representations about the sufficiency or enforceability" of the letter. 
Four months later, no further audit and break with this auditor? Red flags flying. 
EDIT: formatting and missing quotation mark

I get the need for irregular banking channels. It just makes me nervous when I have to trust that more than a billion dollars is in irregular channels but actually properly accounted for. My perhaps pessimistic view of human nature is that even if that situation is legit now, holding a billion plus dollars in irregular ways is not sustainable without fraud unless there are regular and credible audits. 
The audit I linked to above only involves 2 bank balances, and took less than 2 weeks to complete. An audit showing that they have bank balances roughly in line with the amount of tether issued would be a good step. It wouldn't resolve the issue of whether the funds are actually available to redeem all the tether issued, but a minimum transparency requirement.

Remember that Goldman has a patent for a cryptocurrency
Put simply, the patent is for a concept which enables the settling of securities trades through the use of a built-in cryptocurrency. When news of the patent application filing was revealed in December of 2015, the application set forth methods of exchanging so-called SETLcoins for digitized stocks for a variety of companies, including Google and Microsoft, as well as for cryptocurrencies.

There are two possible types of fraud:
1. They 'printed' tether without getting the US$ to back them, thus inflating the price. 
2. People actually bought $2.3 billion in tether, but the reserve US$ that would allow people to cash out are not there.

This is a version of the advance fee scam. Give me something relatively small in value and I'll give you much more. As people note, the Nigerian scams, lotteries, Vitalik "send me ether and I'll send you 10x that back", etc are all variations on this. 
They play not just to people's greed but their feeling that they are entitled to break after all the bounces have gone against them. But once someone has your $, there is no reason to send you a larger amount.

Exactly. Here's a good summary of SEC concerns
Not sure what was changed in this filing, but the issues the SEC raises are pretty fundamental to bitcoin.

There was a case against a bitcoin seller who through a series of transactions sold federal agents more than $10,000 in bitcoin. He ultimately pleaded guilty to failing to register as a money transmitting business. 
As a buyer, you should not need to register. When you cash out, you may need to think about this. 
Think carefully about reporting taxes on gains. If the Feds come after the person who sold bitcoin to you, they will have his wallet address and may look at everyone he sold to - match them up with emails or txt messages, then date/time of meetup to transfers on the blockchain. If they see your wallet has cashed out of a lot of bitcoin, they will be interested in your identity and tax payments.

The [Bitcoin] protocol was based off game theory conceptualization. That's not at all like physics. Consensus algorithms and Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocols are not like laws of gravity. Whether to have a fork and change The Protocol is not like physics. Mining concentration and a 51% attack are different (and more real) than a perpetual motion machine.

Read the article - they are trading derivatives and what they see as related stocks (AMD, NVIDIA, etc) should not impact bitcoin price.

Let' sbe careful about the 'dumping BTC.' Bankruptcy trustees have legal duties to do an orderly liquidation that recovers maximum value.
It seems he may have some more to sell, so there may be some more supply coming to market, but that will not be an indiscriminate dumping either.

I can get many GB of storage on a drive for less than $10. The flash drive part of the Nano that stores the data must be the cheapest part. Just trying to understand this tradeoff in a bit more depth.

The idea that more than 90% of alt coins are worthless (shit coins) is finally sinking in. While there are thousands of alt coins, how many still have people working on them months, even a year after the ICO? The days of pump and dump are fading (not gone by any means - just a bit more skepticism).

Why is this model better than simply having more storage space so more coin apps can be supported simultaneously?

Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoins, according to the current code. Over time, people will lose they keys and the total number of bitcoins will decrease. It is deflationary by design to be an alternative to fiat currencies that tend to be inflationary by design.

Andreas Antanopolos comments that banks are deputized by the govt to assist in identifying money laundering. As deputies and law enforcement, they get a pass on certain bad behavior, including money laundering. 
Yes, the bank paid a fine, but likely less than profits from laundering money and reducing labor costs in their compliance division by not having it fully staffed. (Wait, we get to save money by having few people in compliance AND get to engage in more illegal but profitable behaviors? That sounds like a solid business model...)

Compliance is so much easier with futures - no bitcoin wallets to audit, fewer security risks. Coinbase is working on becoming a custodian for institutions that want to hold bitcoin, but right now that are few if any US players who can be custodians for bitcoin - so futures are the way to go for now.

There's a decent video that explains this as well - Max Fang; Game Theory and Network Attacks: How to Destroy Bitcoin.
