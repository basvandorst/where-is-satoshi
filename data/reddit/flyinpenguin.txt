Fun fact: Satoshi Nakamoto, the older man who was wrongly thought to be the creator of Bitcoin, lives just 2 miles away from Hal Finney. O_o

Are you absolutely sure you want to talk about what is most likely considering Hillary Clinton had a “98% chance” of winning the election?

Didn’t vote, not a Trump supporter. But there was a consorted effort to keep him out of office by the powers that be and they failed. Now that effort has shifted to discrediting him as a president and it’s working on those who don’t live here. I can’t blame you for thinking that, but on this side of the pond I think people think he’s doing a fine job. Unless their premeditated hatred has already determined their opinion on him.

I don’t think it’s as far on one side as it is the other. Yes, he has taken a lot of the dignity away from the political process, is brash and has said and will continue to say stupid things more often than not. 
However, he is a patriot, his policies do make sense and are working fairly well as far as we know. He’s not great like his supporters say, but he’s not an evil, sexist, racist moron like his adversaries claim. He’s in the middle. 
News organizations against him will continue to make him look bad regardless of what he does. I’ve determined that in my own mind after the tax bill was passed, which gave the majority of American’s benefits, but only 18% thought it was good.

That's fucking depressing. Such a huge reason why I hope Cryptos one day take over the financial industry.

Starting a club at my big college about it so hopefully that will lead somewhere

I always was in support of auditing, but I have a tough time finding a reason not to. Is there even a bullshit made up reason not to? 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:22:58
Can anyone explain to me why it is a bad idea to audit the Fed? Genuine question
