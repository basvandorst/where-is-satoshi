Brb, creating "Bitcoin Itcoin" fork

Hi fellow NZ bitcoiner,
Countdown has a brand called [First Knight]( It's alright if you don't want to spend too much, but I much prefer [Wild Fern's Excaliber](

His original message ended in a quote of a message on the bitstamp site regarding the downtime.

circle.com seems to work fine for most credit cards

How are you offering such a hefty discount for bitcoin vs paypal (it's a larger discount than just the paypal fee)?
Do you have an extra charge for international shipping?

Note: it's (plural)

It's good. You get an HD account by default, but you can also hold read only addresses and import private keys.

To anyone else having trouble finding it: try turning off your adblocker. With µBlock, that section was hidden for me.

Got my Nano S recently too... looking forward to this feature ;)

The virtual card is free to add (standard CC usage fees) and instant. I signed up the other day and just paid for my kickstarter pebble watch with it.
* Takes 1 confirmation before the funds show up.
* Can use bitcoin confirmed funds instantly for online payments, but 7 day hold for cash withdrawl at atm.
* You have a lifetime limit of around $600 until you provide verify your account by providing identification.

Amusingly, there's somewhat of a conflict of interest with their [terms of use policy](








Where a “Prohibited Transaction” includes:

Oh, you want to mine? With a GPU?
It's seriously not worth it. Assuming you have a 6970 (reasonably decent mining card), your power was completely free, and you'll run it 24h, you'll be raking in a whopping $0.15 a day.

Cheers, enjoy your 750 millibits

My payment from the 12th is still in limbo... I talked with an AML officer with Kiwibank on Friday, they say it's their intermediary bank, Citibank, who is blocking the transfers.
Talked with another person today from the International department and he confirmed that there's nothing they can do and the payment will be reversed eventually.

This looks like a [decent guide](

While it's not standards based (and they plan to change that), you shouldn't worry about it being "dictionary based".
As [explained here]( the seed is still a 128 bit random number, just displayed as a mnemonic rather than a long and hard to read hexadecimal string.

Use Gyft -&gt; Zeevex -&gt; Steam
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:00:01
Sure does, I'm in NZ and have used this method a couple of times already. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:33:57
Or you can do it all online:

I've been running coined.co.nz for about 3 weeks now. The exchange rate is better than you usually get on bitnz. 
Last of my current stock sold out last night, but you can add your email to get notified when I've restocked. Probably Thursday.

Have you seen  ? Not the biggest fan of the color choices, but I love the unicode character they suggest. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:12:44
Yeah, trying to increase my liquidity so I always have some to trade, but it keeps selling out fast. Hasn't been too much interest in the physical coins so far, not enough to justify a bulk order at least. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:27:44
No, it only needs to contain the private key. It can read in a raw transaction, sign it with this key, then send the signed transaction back for distribution. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:18:56
Oh no, at this rate of growth we could be in real trouble...
