Kinda, but not really? Thief could move/mix the coins once they have them.They'd be pretty dumb to leave them in the known address. If they don't have them, they probably wouldn't leave you alone until they did. Even if your smart contract did somehow refund whatever they took, what is to stop people from doing that to a legit receiver? The latest exchange theft sheds some light on the ways to go about it.

So you are saying Reddit has no influence... You must have never read any of the stories about what this community has done over the years. It has massive influence. Hell, we've caused people to die or become famous or become rich. Reddit has developed million dollar donatiomfunds in the real world and so much more. Is "influence" another word you do not understand?
You're the fucking idiot here. Troll elsewhere.

You don't get to decide the definition of the word. It's already been decided. And if you think calling someone paranoid because they realize that arguments are being made by someone who is trying to have influence over a market, you are confused. Re-read the definition.

They already have time delayed storage wallets available, on coinbase even. The problem is in if the captor's realize that and then they either have to keep you so it goes through, which increases difficulty for them, or beat the info out of you and take your device so that they ensure it goes through without being cancelled after they leave. Alternative I can think of is one that makes it look like it is a for sure thing with an alternate key you only use if it is for theft, then after your decoy coins look like they are being sent to captors and you are free, use your master key to report that those decoy coins indeed went to a lawbreaker's wallet and lock them out or track them. You can also May be sacrifice or have insurance on some of the balance so that if the captors tries to test spend from their wallet, it would work. Then there's the problem of ppl being scammed or of captor's getting smart enough to out maneuver that trick too though and come up with other ways to verify their coins are clean and in their control.

Propaganda: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.
Your very own comment to me a couple minutes a go about how I am a biased because I spend time in crypto and about how that other guy is "delusional" is in itself propaganda and trying to sway people's views. You have quite a lot to do with it and most news you read likely is biased and would fall under the same term, to varying degrees.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:07:13
Nobody can prove any point in crypto as for sure going one way or another, but if we look at past performance, growing adoption, and the amount of people invested who refuse to sell(such as that guy), then it is reasonable to think thar BTC should stay, on average, above $7k. Personally, I don't see it dropping below 8k anytime in the 3 months, but freely admit I don't have that much proof or basis of that opinion and it can be entirely wrong. What's your proof it would likely fall from 7k to 0?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:55:07


Your lack of knowledge in this field is showing again. There are other coins for that which make much more sense. BTC isn't practical because it can be traced and takes too long.


Yup. They're also too high for drugs.


"Nuh-uh!" They can't just ban it, it's decentralized and out of their control. They can hinder it, but trying to stop it entirely would be like trying to stop people from going on porn sites. Good luck with that.


Based on what? The fact you can't just admit when you are wrong about something and instead ignore the arguments or sidetrack with personal insult? Classic inability to think critically and act maturely. Gee, I wonder why so many people downvoted you on 9/10 things you think you are right about.

"All of that was speculative and subjective. You've provided no real evidence to back your claims." There is a fundamental value behind it, in that millions of people use it right now.

I have valid rebuttals to every one of those.


I said "like" it, bc it is an example of an alternative that doesn't rely on asic mining that continues to waste more and more energy. It also puts the power in the hands of those with regular computers, instead of the rich buying a bunch of specialized hardware and cutting everyone else out.


Yes it does, that is not arbitrary. Would you buy a cup of coffee and have to wait 10 minutes before they serve it to you? Of course not. And the solutions are just band-aids to that problem.


Because it is ridiculous. You're trying to justify a flawed system.


Many other coins, vtc included, make it much easier to be participate without having to meet such high standards already.


    
Lol! That's like me saying v12 cars are the most practical, because they make a lot of power without even having to be efficient. Umm, why wouldn't you want a turbo v6 thst gets better mileage, handles better, is cheaper to produce, uses less materials and has quicker response?


Right, it needs to waste an exponential amountof power to work and wherever the chealest energy is is where the most miners would go to. Even if that helps solar adoption, it's still wasting the energy that wouldn't be needed with PoS.
 It should be out of the reach of some countries.  It should be out of the reach of some **combinations** of countries.
Have you not already heard of how China and other eastern countries already have the majority of miners?


Yes, they do harm the planet by expending unneeded energy that could be used better elsewhere.


Another analogy would be good for this one. That's like saying someone killing millions of people helps to "subsidize" a better humanity because now there's less mouths to feed and there may be a more moral group of people created to help combat that mass murderer. The ends don't justify the means. Just bc it drives us to find a solution to 1 problem it created doesn't mean we should keep letting that problem continue, instead of eliminating the problem itself with a solution that doesn't require that mass amount of energy.


Nobody is arguing that the current system of USD is better, or else why would cryptocurrency have any use in the first place? Now compare that to the system that can be powered in everyone's home with their computer that's already running and doesn't require a solar farm...

No, I don't, you are right about that. But his specific example was not bad advice as it advocated a certain price and then dollar cost averaging after that. Of course it would be a bad idea if the market was never going to recover, but all signs point to BTC being above $7k in the near future.

It's easy to feel safe online and that your funds are secure, but there's not much to stop someone from holding a gun to your head and forcing you to send your coins to the their address. Even if he had his coins on a time lock, then the captors would probably hold him hostage until it went through. A wife and baby were involved, but luckily nobody was harmed.

1. That only protects a portion of your savings. If it isn't enough, the thief would never believe you sent them all you had, assuming they came after you knowing you had a sizable amount.  
2. Keeping it somewhere else and having multisig is smartest. Problem being that they may hold something else hostage as collateral while you go get it for them. At least it makes an opportunity for escape and help though.

You're shockingly right. The hope is that "we" are the ones with the gold.

History shows everything evolves slowly through generations. 
My hope (as an educated 80/90's kid) is technology/crypto/society advances in a way that mitigates some of the new power in the financial system to infallible coding and a more balanced "voting" system that decides on popular *opinions* on policies, while having everything else based on fact/science/coding. (See: legalize/declassify things like marijuana, which actually benefits the majority
 But "vote", based on current research/opinion, for how to implement policies  that history hasn't encountered before.
And hopefully facts will prevail a little more.

For it to crash entirely the whole blockchain would have to get taken out worldwide from every server and replaced with a new illegitamate one immediately. And even then, people would just consider that a fork and adopt a new "core" Bitcoin most likely. Just my guesses.

Explain. It's got some risk, but the likelihood that his BTC pays off just as much, or multitudes more over 10 years, is pretty high. It can't tank to nothing overnight and as long as he is storing it offline, it's safer than it was before. It's also pretty liquid now, as he should be able to cash it out within a day to move it better places.
Edit: Obviously, don't trust savings into BTC. It's not "safe" by any means. Even notioning that the idea is okay will get you at least this much negative attn.

If I held up a Western Union a few hours and charged people exponential amounts more for the same service and then you compared those rates to the rates of another money service: wouldn't you think the circumstances are relevant to the fact that it wasn't business as usual?

What's the finite limit on fiat money printed or added to a banks budgeting book? There isn't one and they can literally loan out millions with only thousands in their possession, and  never be expected to ever come up with it either. So they can loan millions to corporate interests and buddies and then get a bailout when shit hits the fan. At least with Bitcoin they'd be held responsible for what they owed and couldn't make it up without breaking the whole system in the process.

The fundamental problem with currency. If you aren't directly trading 1 thing of clear value for another thing of clearly equal value, there's a percentage you can deviate and someone gets the upper hand. It's always the person giving up cash that gets a worse deal than the person who sold them the good. Especially when it is a huge company who uses labor cheaper than the market they are in, (USD for 3rd world goods) helping them drive an even larger profit for themself I steas of coming out pretty equal. Multiply that percentage changing slightly and transactions thousands of times every day and you eventually reach the inflation we see with the USD today where $1 does not buy you even 1/4 of what it did just 50 years a go. End the federal reserve. We can't keep adding track to the cliff this train is driving off of.

I noticed that like 2 weeks a go when I went to send like $50 and the fee was .25. I figured it was bad timing but have since confirmed that it went up quite a bit.

That's a pretty good idea. It's like a loan that you don't have to pay back and it has interest profitable in your favor. I feel like many who were given something(btc or not) are then able to feel the joy of being able to pass it on and give back to someone else. Reminds me of the whole "Today you, tomorrow me" idea. I know that when I had someone give me reading materials, whitepapers, and help me understand crypto in the beginning, we had both felt the need to just pass along info and encourage others interested. I sold a few in person at cost and helped a stranger set up a wallet on their phone while just standing outside a coffee shop. Such an awesome feeling.

I can take 1. Or a few. If it were me I'd do it slowly. First exchange some on local bitcoins securely without worrying about the best rate as much as where the coins transferred were going to. Then enhance my life greatly by paying for my education to become a renewable energy engineer and then install solar and wind panels through my own company which I started with a loan. Pay off loan with cashed out coins over time but disguise it as profits from the company and my own salary. Make the world a better place and actually do a lot of free energy work and fund some "research team" of my own to funnel some more money.

Money can move and transform in different ways, sometimes shrinking in value in one place and growing in value in another, especially when you factor in a little bit of time for fluctuation towards the positive side.

I'm glad you understood exactly what I meant. The only real option is a totally new system that is quite unlike the one we have now. Throw out all the old tyrants and start over with something fresh.
