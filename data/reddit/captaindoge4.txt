Both coinbase/circle/other BTC banks offer a much more secure storage and some like coinbase has coverage for lost and stolen money, though remember, they are banks. Wallets are private and you have complete control on them and even if your hard drive goes to hell if you have the seed for the wallet your ok, but remember if you make that one mistake of not noting down the seed and your hard drive dies, poof all the moneys gone.

They've got nothing to lose and have no reason to lie. They are at the moment the only savior fed wise for BTC.

A seed is basically a list of 12 words, when any wallet is made it will say make a new seed or use an existing on. Seeds are actually easier, all it is is memory and you'll have your coins back in seconds.

We don't need crap banks who can take all of our money in an instant. We don't need Feds to watch us all the time. We need anonymity and trust that our money is safe. Bitcoin has it.

But they have nothing.

Move to Washington state, we probably will have this happen to us last. West coast FTW. Take it while it lasts.

Oh and about syncing, no, it's a first time thing, leave it over night  for a while and it'll be ok.

4chan,8chan,gamergate,anonymous all attacking at once while lulzsec resurrects and takes down random sites while lizard squad ddos all the gaming networks at once. Oh ya and 9gag acts like a dumbass and we end up with a side war against them and 4can.

The joke applies more to people with OCD.

With proper tools it can be achieved.

I understand jokes, just not this one. I take that back I get it now lol.

I support you. All we need the do now is to send dogecoin guys at them and complain their asses out and we can quietly do our business in peace while shibes fight for us.
