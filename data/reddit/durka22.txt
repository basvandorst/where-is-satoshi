We can take bitcoin as payment as a direct transfer but I will check the other crypto-payment processor a redditor mentioned to me to see if we can integrate it directly to the site. But we can do the manual invoice method. 
Also I will check on available discounts for crypto payments and that mountain bike.

Riders have reported less vibration  (more comfy ride) than a steel frame bike. Bamboo frames are lighter than mid range steel bikes and some high end brands.  We also sell just the frames if you want a DIY project.

3D printed hemp? I’d like to look into that. We use a lot of hemp in production.
