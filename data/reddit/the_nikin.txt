Paul Krugman (1998): "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”

look at the guy post history if you want to understand. A troll posting the same over and over looking for attention.

Yes, i removed and re added my linked wells fargo account. Bought ETH and BTC and they were available instantly. I read a post here earlier and tried it and its true.

All the transfers take 1-2 days

No problems at all for deposit or cashing out btc to usd

I just bought with coinbase and my bank account, instantly. There is no more 10 days wait time when buying with bank account. Problem are some credit cards, not banks.

Coinbase has been top notch for me. Instant buys with bank and insured. If you can wait then I also recommend Gemini but bank funds take 24 hours to credit

what happened? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:01:28
They can’t block your bank transfers. It’s like cash, they don’t have control over that. The ones that are blocking are only CREDIT cards.

Right now you need bitcoin to buy all those projects whether you like it or not.

This has nothing to do with $SUNE in any way. You’re wrong.
