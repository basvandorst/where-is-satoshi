This isn't news.  This isn't even true, BFL gives the shipping funds to the hosting company towards hosting costs.  This is just more BFL trolling.  Please don't ruin my beloved reddit with this crap.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:50:13
This looks fishy.  So the hardware is competitive...  but what do they charge for the hosting? 
@_date: 2013-09-10 12:25:35
Actually, BFL offered refunds up to the time they started shipping.  Let's not twist the facts to suit the bashing narrative.
@_date: 2013-09-12 15:37:45
They've never produced anything before.  Everyone that's ever delivered anything has been late.  That seems to be the rule.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:00:50
Can we please not ruin Reddit with this belly aching crap?
@_date: 2013-08-29 01:21:56
At least I got my BFL miners.  I feel bad for the Avalon chip buyers.  What I don't understand is why there isn't an explanation.  Whatever it is, it's better than silence.
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:19:34
I'll by them.  PM me please.
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:40:31
It's nice to see a level headed article.  You might also mention that BFL offered us customers the option of getting a full refund up til they started shipping.  
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:15:07
It's twice as expensive as BFL's cards and consumes much more power.  Cointerra is cheaper as well.  What's the point?
@_date: 2013-09-07 15:24:50
Here we go again.

They've shipped more ASIC's than any other competitor.  Can someone explain why they're a scam?  I have a single hashing in the next room.  It works just fine.  I don't think you can 'scam' up an ASIC processor.

The real situation isn't what you want to hear.  Anytime anybody goes to BFL and looks at their facility, they come away impressed and singing their praises.  Did you see Phinneus Gage's latest report?  He used to be their greatest detractor, but he saw with his own eyes.  They're shipping in volume and the gear is pretty damned good stuff.  Sorry, but it's true.  Get over it.
@_date: 2013-08-30 11:35:56
More BFL trolling.  
@_date: 2013-08-29 01:32:13
Why boycott BFL?  They're delivering and they answer the phone.  
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:28:12
BFL is delivering singles &amp; mini rigs.  This is going to keep going.
@_date: 2013-09-17 13:36:16
Please, for the love of Christ quit spamming reddit with repetitive BFL threads.
@_date: 2013-09-09 15:12:36
Did you agree to the terms of purchase that say all sales are final and delivery will take several months or more?
@_date: 2013-08-28 11:06:15
Nice video.  You're three months late.  Sorry.

Mesh networks are what we need.  If governments are going to shut down the internet during times of conflict, then we really need an alternative that can't be shut down.  Bitcoin can work if communication continues to be available.  If not, it'll depend on people's confidence that connectivity will return soon enough.

Difficulty has a ceiling.  People won't run their miners if they're loosing money to the power company.  So at some point in the future, all the lesser hardware will be pulled offline leaving the market to people with Monarchs or equally efficient gear.
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:05:46
So you're making $60 a day and you make all your money back in 21 days?  
@_date: 2013-08-24 18:13:08
So let me get this straight, they've shipped more bitcoin mining devices than anyone else for almost three years now and you still think they might be a scam?  
@_date: 2013-09-02 15:27:34
If the hardware is KNC, the power consumption will sink you before any of the other 28nm technology.  Having said that, if KNC delivers early enough that's less relevant.
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:51:36
They notified me when they were late and gave me a chance to stay in.  I chose to stay in and now I have a single hashing away.  Not a scam.  You can downvote me to oblivion, but fact is fact.
@_date: 2013-09-15 15:59:21
PSA yourself.  You just don't like what I've got to say.  Is Phinneus Gage (the most prolific poster at bitcointalk) a shill?
