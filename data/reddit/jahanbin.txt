Here is the problem with LN as I see it.  I be happy if someone explains to me how I am wrong.
1-Miners depend on the block reward + transaction fees to mine. 
2-As block rewards keep halving every 4 years the relevance on the transaction fees will increase.  The hope is that the transaction volumes grow to the point that they offset the diminishing block rewards.
LN will allow for users to create a payment channel and perform unlimited transactions (assuming there are enough funds) within one on block transaction. This will cause users to automatically be attracted to the LN solution. If blocks are not increased and LN is used as a scaling solution the increase in volume will not benefit the miners.  As miners have bills to pay they will increase the transaction fees for the on blockchain transaction.  This will cause the fees for regular bitcoin transactions to skyrocket to the point that it will never make any sense to perform transactions on the block.  
LN does not provide an additional choice for performing a transaction it will actually cause all transactions to be on LN because of the skyrocketing transaction fees on the blockchain.  I personally would prefer a choice and this is not one.

note core?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:22:57
Sounds like core should have followed through with what they promised during the New York agreement and increases the blocksize to 2 MB.  That was like 2 years ago.  We would have avoided these problems and avoided Bitcoin cash and gold.  Can we finally wake up and do this already?

Generally support these guys but after the last update suddenly my pin wouldn't work.  Note i have used this same pin for months with no issue.  After multiple failed attempts it wanted me to restore.

But luke dash Jr. and Max are popping champagne because of the high fees.  Their words not mine.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:42
Even lighting would need an on chain transaction to open and close a channel.  Your argument is flawed and dated.  1MB block is not enough.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:02
Let's build a system that depends on individual companies to implement a tech. And depends on that for the backbone of everything.  Hmm segwit without a blocksize increase sounds like a great idea.  Wake up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:54
I been involved with BTC for over 4 years and I been HODLing.  I care about fees.  We should all care about fees.  What value does Bitcoin have if you can't transact with it?  This is not just an investment tool.  This is supposed to change the world.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:27
Segwit helps but our growth is too fast for Segwit to really help.  even if everyone was using segwit addresses we would be at approximately 1.7MB blocks.  We need larger blocks now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:50
Current recommended fee is 501 sat/B. With that fee it is easy to see $20 transactions if not higher. Source: blockchain.info
Even lighting network will need a transaction with that amount of fee to open and close the channel.
It's obvious that segwit although needed was not the scaling solution we needed.  We need bigger blocks now.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:05
Yes let's continue to ignore the problem and simple solution.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:10
Even with 100% of wallets supporting segwit we will only be at ~1.7mb and that is not enough for the traffic we have now.  It's unrealistic to except everyone to update their wallets to take advantage of a new tech in this time schedule.  There are too many variables to account for.  Hence there was compromise suggestions like segwit 2x. But everyone here was against that.  If core doesn't wake up and do a real block size increase we will lose this first mover advantage quickly to other copy coins.  But yes I'm there retard!!!
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:41:45
My concerns with LN:
As we all know the block reward half's every 4 years.  We also know that as part of the block reward the miners also get the transaction fees.  The idea is that as the rewards reduce miners (the backbone of the network) will depend more and more on transaction frees.  With LN, transactions within the channel will not be adding fees for every transaction.  The fees will only be paid for opening and closing channels.  This will cause reduced transaction on the bitcoin blocks hence increase transaction charges to the point that it will not make sense to transact without LN since the costs will be too high.  
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:00:59
Your math is flawed we will reach 20mil ~15 years from now.  ~2030
@_date: 2015-12-26 04:37:56
As miners start to get less and less from the block reward they will need more income from fees to pay for their mining.  If all transactions are on the block chain and we have larger blocks this will not be an issue as the fees will be divided between users but if most transactions end up on LN there will only be a few transactions on the block.  This means that they will need these few transactions to cover most of their expenses + profit.  This will cause them to increase the price by not accepting lower fees for transactions.  These higher fees may make sense of you are dealing with LN channels but for regular transactions they will not make sense causing everyone to use LN.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:28:16
Yes I know every ~4 years.  You will still get to 20 million by ~2030. Look at the link provided it has a chart.

yet they still call me every time I purchase bitcoins and treat me like a criminal and act like they are going to close my account.  -Hasn't happened yet-
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:22:00
Why does everyone assume a 8MB block means that the blocks will be 8MB instantly.  8MB is the Max size, with todays transaction volume I doubt we hit 2MB on a consistent bases for some time. Chinese miners will not be concerned with larger blocks until the volume increases.  By then they should have the resources to deal with the larger blocks (or at least be planned for it as the size gradually increases due to the increased volume). 
BIP101 is not a final solution nor is it the best in the long run but it is the best solution we can implement today and we should.

I have seen no proof of him"spamming" the network.  Please enlighten me.  If you disagree with a person disagree with facts.  If core devs had paid more attention to the other side instead of trying to censor them we would not be in this situation.  It is only out of desperation that big blockers are taking the actions that they are.  If their ideas where value and a compromise was done from the beginning we wouldn't be here.

Miners aren't Charity.  They get paid by the reward.  In 12 years when the reward is not large enough to mine for we hopefully have a network with bigger blocks that can handle more than 3.5 tx/s.  Then there will be more fees to be collected by miner.
and no LN is not the solution.  That will cause more problem for the users. 
this petty argument is really making alts attractive.  We are not the most advance virtual currency we just have the advantage of being the first.  We can't risk these games.  This is more risky than a fork.

Segwit will not help that much.  I be surprised if we get more than a 5% increase from it initially.  All wallets and tools will need to be updated to take advantage of it.  Support for it is not unanimous so I doubt that will happen right away. We need to increase the block size now and put an end to this battle.  Since core devs is not listening we need to start mining Classic.

@_date: 2016-11-23 00:54:32
Yes I'm aware of this.  It is a temporary relief but not really a scaling solution.  At the rate Bitcoin is growing what SegWit gives us will not be enough a few months after it gets excepted(if it happens ever).  We should do both SegWit+ some type of block increase(in in favor of limit less blocks and letting miners decide on the size(they already do this))

I have the opposite problem.  I live in USA and want to buy btc from an exchange outside of USA.  This is because I believe that US laws require too much information from me.  I don't want to provide this intimation not because I'm doing anything illegal but because I believe providing this intimation goes against the principals of Bitcoin.  Both circle and coinbase closed my account because I wouldn't tell them what I used the money for (again nothing illegal I just refused to provide the info).

These guys didn't start acting up until specific core devs broke promises and still to this day deny there issue.  For months they talked about how blocks are not full and how most transactions are spam.  Even today we have core devs recommending reducing the blocks to 350KB or staying that there is nothing with full blocks.  This dismissive additute has caused the other side to make their own mistakes.  The truth it's both SegWit and BU are good technologies and we should probably deploy both.

It's very common for vendors to have a backdoor in their products.  Although it's not something I agree with it is the norm these days.  I wish it wasn't but it is.  With that said there has not been any proof of them misusing this door.  This is just blockstream trying to change the narrative.

People been complaining about this for years now.  Can we get a simple block increase already.

It is a HF. A wolf in sheep's clothing.

It doesn't people just need someone to blame for SegWit but activating.  In fact even if he starts signaling for SegWit tomorrow we will only be at 70% when we need 95% to activate.

I have made few purchases over $1000.  Went smooth but took longer for them to be picked up.  Currently I have a ~$1500 order waiting for pickup.

Thank you for the explanation.  But wouldn't this basically force a hard fork between those that do and those that don't switch to the UASF client.
Also I don't think I agree with "[miners](presumably to prolong high fee profits)" big blockers have been trying to increase the block size for over 2 years.  Many of the miners that are not signaling SegWit want a hard fork with a larger block that would reduce the fees.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:17:08
I know about the 2016. but if they activate right before 2016 recalculation say at 2015 they will recalculate after one block only.  At least that is how I understand it.   
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:43:05
I do as well.  This issue is not about China.  It just so happens that most miners are there because of cheap power.  This disagreement has nothing to do with the location.

Eth or dash is much better choice if you are going to buy an alt.  I doubt litecoin will go up much from here. If it does it's only because of people buying it because they don't know better.  They are not doing anything interesting or revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:59:20
I believe so.  If Bitcoin takes over just 1% of the world economy it will be worth over $30K.  Do the math.
World Economy ~$78,000,000,000,000 X .01 / 21000000 (max number of bitcoins reached year 2140) = $37142

@_date: 2017-05-17 03:53:49
I hope you are being sarcastic.  People been trying to do a simple block size increase for 3-4 years.  Core should have taken that.  SegWit is a good solution but a short term one that is not really going to help scaling.  We need to bigger blocks now and SegWit right after.  Even combining SegWit+4mb blacks would be good start at this time.  We are shooting our self in the groin just about now and it really hurts.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:30:03
We have 123 years before the last bitcoin is created (inflation).  We shouldn't be slowing down the growth of bitcoin by forcing fees into the market at this point just because in a 100 years there will be no new BTC for the miners.  Who know what BTC will be like in 50 years, 100 years from now.  Fees right now should be extremely low I say about 2c like they used to be before this mess started.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:40:12
I'm as much as a fortune teller as you are.  You can't tell people they are buying high without acting like you know where the price is going.  This was exactly my point.  You are entitled to your opinion but I believe this is low.  I personally started buying at around$150 and have never stopped.  Last purchase was at$1580.

the volatility is reducing continuously.  In the most recent past the volatility is bellow that of Oil.  As the market cap grows (currently ~$25 Billion) it will get more and more stable.
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:58:13
You are obviously correct about the reduction of the payouts​ over time.  If you look at the historic value increase of Bitcoin over it's life span your will see that it is above the 25% increase needed to offset the reduction of the payouts.  In fact we are way above the 25%.  There is no reason the reduce the growth at this point by forcing a fee market that is 50 times what it should be. If this was a concern you would see miners requesting higher fees. And they are not.  Also keep in mind that increases transaction throughput will bring increases fees for the miners.
I would be interested in seeing what your expectations/ideal expectations are for fee to issuance ratio during each having going forward.  I would think this is something you guys have discussed and planned.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:46:24
Yes this is all caused by the devs trying to do a soft fork.  A soft fork with lower % is very risky.  This is why I believe a hard fork at 75% makes much more sense.  The sad part is that the same devs that decided on the 95% are now doing UAFS that doesn't even need 1% and is way more risky.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:01:07
UASF is only a soft fork for people running the UASF client.  It really should be UAHF as it's forcing a hard fork on a given day no matter how many of the people support the change.  The same people that wanted 95% of the hashing power to be safe to do a segwit upgrade are now doing one that doesn't even require 1% of the hashing power.  This is insanity.

I urge you to please just pause your shenanigans and let us move forward.  this has to end.  We have to come together before Eth takes over.

Incorrect as of this message BU + Classic have 43% needing 75% to activate.
SegWit has 31% needed 95% to activate.
For the record I support both.  But I think we are closer to getting bigger blocks approved.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:16:53
Or maybe you just disagree with his way of extending the network.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:27:02
SegWit is good almost everyone agrees to that.  UASF is not.  Jihan and Roger agree to SegWit they just think a HF to larger blocks is easier and should go first.  At this point they seem to be agreeing to change that order with the NY agreement.  We just need core to agree to compromise now 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:09:28
I had 2FA enabled.  I got a notice last night that my orders can't get processed because I don't have enough funds in my account.  I know I had enough funds.  Today I log in and all is good.  I think I was impacted by they have credited me.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:13:54
This shouldn't be called UASF.  It should be called UAHF.  The whole point of a soft fork is to keep backward compatibility.  If you are causing a split chain you are hard forking.  Most of you didn't want to do a simple 1 to 2MB change because you said a hard fork is risky and could split the chain.  And now this?!  UASF is a very bad idea.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:41:18
Unfortunately no matter what UASF is splitting.  Anyone running that code will be on a diff chain as soon as Aug 1 is reached.  Best we can hope for would be that we come up with something before that date.

So why buy litecoin?  Buying Bitcoin would make more sense.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:52:08
The vast majority of miners are against it. As of two days ago only 10% of the nodes are running UASF.  Miners are way below that.  My guess: as soon as it activated they will hard fork to lower difficulty it's the only way.
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:46:59
what you don't take into consideration is that by that time the fees collected for performed transactions should be higher than the block reward.  In the long run block reward will become less and less important.  At that point miners will not be competing to generate new coins but to collect the fees.  With income coming from fees there is no incentive to increase block time.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:04:56
Lol sure let's go with a coin that has fraction of use and developers that is a total copy.  If you are going to recommend an alt this shouldn't be one of them.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:05:52
Actually I just looked at the calendar.  The difficulty last rest ~5/23.  Seeing that it recalculates every ~ two weeks.  Aug 1 is a day of recalculation. So they probably don't have to force a HF for difficulty.  If they do it right before the difficulty change the wait won't be that long even with lower hash rate.  They planned that part pretty good unfortunately.

sorry English is not my 1st or 2nd language :(
I wish I could correct that.
@_date: 2016-07-15 22:00:12
I am by no means recommending that.  Coups generally take days and at some point people wonder out to try to live.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:36:05
Only innovative thing that litecoin has done was to be there first altcoin.  Only reason it's getting any traction at all is because it's founder works for the largest exchange in the US and has gotten it listed there.  There are many more innovative altcoin out there.  Don't waste your money in litecoin.

Wow so Harsh.
As someone that has been through a coup I can tell you that it is better to have access to some form of currency than to have access to none(if the banks close).  Plus a lot changes during a coup business start taking IOUs or any form of payment.  It basically becomes a barter system.
A quick search online shows at least some businesses take BTC and that there is an exchange within Turkey.
I am by no means trying to solve every problem in the world.  Coups can be hard to live through and I am just trying to inform people.  What they do with it is their choice.  
Thanks for your comment.

I would prefer for you to go hide under whatever rock your crawled out of and leave Bitcoin be.  Although your programming skills may be something to admire, your lack of logic and toxic personality has done too much damage.  Stop spreading fallacies and let this agreement take hold.

I believe it's too soon to go-to bits.  Having 1,000,000 bits for a Bitcoin will make them seem worthless.  They will be worth ~$0.00029 each.  I think it makes more sense to go to mBTC (I like to pronounce that Em-bits even though it's technically wrong).  With that each mBTC would be with $2.90.
