Holding is stupid.  He could have sold at 18000 or 17000 and not eaten the 4-5000 loss BTC has taken and bought in again at 13000.  Why eat a loss like that?  Worst case scenario he sells at 18000 and then it starts going up he can buy back in.

And how will it ever be convenient?  As inconvenient as it is already, people are getting their wallets stolen left and right.  Usually for something to be more convenient it loses some security.  Bitcoin couldn't lose more security if it tried.  
The entire Mt.Gox username/password database is on bitcoin.org and if I spent half an hour I am sure I could empty out at least a few people's online wallets, which was the first attempt at convenience. . . . 
@_date: 2011-06-12 23:51:34
Except that if this was a sale and a person made 8.6 million from it, it would crash the market and then he could buy back in at a lower price and have even more bitcoins than before..

I run mine on air.  57c.  Overclocked to 1000mhz core, 330mhz mem.  305Mhash/s.  Stable up to 1050mhz core giving 315Mhash/s.  
Selling them down the road might be an issue, but they also cost what, less than half of a 6950?  
There is a reason they are sold out everywhere.

What the fuck are you talking about?  Your example is shit btw, because banks are FDIC insured.  Also your example is shit because it has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.  Whoever upvoted you is a moron.  
And MtGox is absolutely relevant when you are talking about the overall security of SPENDING AND RECEIVING BITCOINS and using them for TRANSACTIONS.  Seriously your reading comprehension is shit.  Do you know how to read in context?  We are talking about the convenience of paying people in bitcoins.  What I said was that to make it more convenient, you will lose security, which is undeniable.  Explain to me how you would make the use of bitcoins as a currency easier without the potential for a loss in security??????
Ill be waiting.

@_date: 2011-06-15 01:11:11
You are thinking of it as the US just declaring it illegal and then thats the end of it.  If the US declares it illegal, they will go after online exchanges no matter what country they are stationed in.  They will do it under the guise of the patriot act.  Once the exchanges start to get shut down, bitcoin value will crash to next to nothing, and a vast majority of miners will stop mining.  A vast majority of users don't care about bitcoin as a potential currency, they care about making money off of it.  Once that dries up, bitcoin will be a shell of what it is right now.

Any company that accepts bitcoins better not be a publicly traded company because the shareholders would and should go apeshit if that happens.  One day the currency is worth 8 dollars and a couple days later its 30 and then back down to 10 and now up to 20??  A company can't accept currency that does that.

Where did I say anything remotely close to that?  It just sucks ass to have a 26 hour long round.  Maybe you like long rounds for some reason though.

Only 950 Mhash per rig?  3 5830's could do that.  
@_date: 2011-06-15 04:06:41
Even if you had a hundred core2duo's running, they won't equal what a single 5830 can output.  And you won't be really making any money.  And you will get fired, eventually.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:52:27
No its too late to jump in right now.  Had you gone all in on this difficulty level that is about to end tomorrow, then it would have been OK.  If you have a bunch of desktops lying around that just need video cards to mine, then that is basically the only way I would spend a bunch right now to get started, because it drastically reduces the price of entry.  The next difficulty level is going to make paying back the cost of hardware a several week affair instead of a few days.  By the time you pay back the hardware, you will probably be mining peanuts due to difficulty increases.
Say you bought 3 5830's and everything needed to make it run for around $600, which is a very very reasonable price if not underpriced.  The next difficulty is going to be in the realm of 900,000.  Those 3 5830's will earn you ~$176 in the first week.  Not even a third of the rig paid off.  Assuming a modest 30% rise in difficulty after that, you will be making ~$132 a week.  You can figure it out from there.  It will take you a LONG time to pay back your hardware.  You aren't going to be getting rich quick anymore.

Ill clear things up.  I think anyone who invests that kind of money into a complete unknown like this is a little crazy unless that money is absolutely non-essential to them.  There is zero indication and at this point zero probability that bitcoin will become a viable currency.  Its in a shitty position.  The only reason the price is as high as it is, is because of speculators.  If the speculators leave the price plummets.  If the market is heavily influenced by speculators, then it will be volatile and absolutely no business will ever accept it as a currency.  If governments begin cracking down on exchanges, the price will plummet.  If government goes after places like silkroad, the price will plummet.  If government makes it illegal, which they eventually will, price will plummet.  
The people who think it will rise to hundreds of dollars per bitcoin at this point are deluding themselves.  
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:59:56
No, you don't.  You have to account for difficulty increases every 1-2 weeks.  If you brought a system with 1000Mhash/s online tomorrow, you would be looking at a difficulty of ~900k.  You would be making ~22 a day for around 10 days.  Then assuming a very modest 30% rise in difficulty, we can see how much you would make for the month:
22.35*10 = 223.5  Difficulty 900k
16.76*10 = 167.6  Difficulty 1200k
12.90*10 = 129.0  Difficulty 1560k
~$520.1 in a month.  Wouldnt pay back the hardware needed to make those 1000Mhash/s over a month.  Of course there will be variations both in difficulty and the time between difficulty rises, but if you are planning and plopping down a bunch of cash you better plan for the worst case scenario.

No, its simply a large percentage of people associated with bitcoins no matter where you go.  They think its going to revolutionize the world and that each bitcoin will be worth thousands.  Its really amazing to read their rampant speculation based on absolutely nothing.  As soon as a major retailer like Amazon starts accepting bitcoin, then I'll believe. . . 
@_date: 2011-06-28 02:31:33
I wouldn't be either.  That 5k is now worth just over 3k.  I would buy another 5k if I was in your shoes.

He or she WANTS to move the market.  Thats the whole point of selling or buying in that quantity.

Well I am currently running a 5850 at 910mhz with memory at 330mhz at 1.25 volts using Trixx.  Of course each card is different.  A quickish way to do do it if you are using it only for mining is to start your miner and keep upping the core clock until it freezes.  Once it freezes bump up the voltage a bit and repeat.  I wouldn't personally go higher than 1.25 volts, although I THINK, but make sure you look further into this, I THINK the max the card can take is 1.35 volts.  If you really wanted to do it quick and kind of sloppy, just bump up the voltages to whatever you feel comfortable having it at, and then keep upping the clock until it freezes and after it does, reboot and set it for 10-15mhz below that.  Make sure to monitor the rig though, because sometimes it will freeze an hour later.  If it runs for 6-12 hours its fairly stable.
@_date: 2011-06-29 02:45:00
There might not be a legal risk, but if a business is stuck with hundreds or thousands of bitcoins and then they are declared illegal, what do they do then?  
The financial risk is not "nil".  They have to spend time creating a way to accept bitcoins and spend time actively selling them.  If the markets get shut down or hacked they have absolutely no way to convert their magic alphanumeric sequences into real money.  The possibility that the exchanges won't eventually get shut down is minuscule.  With things like the patriot act and the possibility for some very seedy and illegal transactions with bitcoins, its one if the easiest targets for governments.  Also, they shut down online poker because of possible tax dodging, I mean seriously think about that for a second.  You think MtGox is going to stay open much longer, especially if it makes the news due to something shady like drugs or weapons trade or something like that?
I personally think a LOT of people are being ridiculously naive about this bitcoin thing.  Everyone should have a skeptical attitude about it simply because of how unknown the future looks for it right now.  People dumping tens of thousands into it as an investment are crazy.  They may end up making millions, but that doesn't change that their actions are crazy.

@_date: 2011-06-14 05:59:26
First of all because you could blatantly steal peoples bitcoins without even hiding behind proxies and what are the victims going to do about it?  Go to the police?  LOL.  Explain to the police about a crypto currency you have been mining online, yea that would get you far.  There is no recourse for the victim at all, and virtually zero risk in stealing bitcoins.  There have also been tens of thousands of people's login information for various places leaked recently, which could be a cause.  Virus' and malware are a possibility as well.
