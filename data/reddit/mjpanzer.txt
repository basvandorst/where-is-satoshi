I'm not sure yet if I'm looking to buy, but I have to imagine people buying is good for everyone who owns bitcoins right?
Coming to this subreddit it should be clear who to exchange with.
Google gives me Mt.Gox but everyone here seems to hate them.

Honestly interested to hear what newspaper you believe has more credibility/is better than the WSJ? 
If you think print media in general (or at least *papers*, because The Economist dat real shit yo) has lost credibility, that's another argument. But, while I can't say I am a News Corp fan, the WSJ, in my opinion, has always been a fantastic paper.

All good points and I agree with it all.

I came to to see your opinion on the huge writeup by the WSJ today on whether cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, have a future.
I was surprised to see it hadn't been submitted!

Just found it thanks! Thread deleted.
Weird I couldn't find it before.
I also then figured by submitting the link here to the WSJ article, it would automatically take me to the submitted one (which is what reddit does when you try to repost). But it let me repost an article. Weird.

lol exactly. It's the "Journal Report" section of the WSJ.
It's opinion based...working with...questions!
They literally do this for a bunch of questions one after another.
