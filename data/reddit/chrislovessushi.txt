Binance is great! In the future use a faster/cheaper coin to send between exchanges such as LTC or ETH.

If someone talks to you on the internet then it’s safe to assume they either want to take your money or put something in your butt.

You're correct. But I'm sure a large number of people don't bother paying taxes on their crypto profits since they aren't high enough to expect an audit.

When the prices go down, it creates an opportunity to buy more. Stop moping around and BTFD :)

Officially the worst post I’ve ever seen on this sub. Congrats!

Avoiding the tough questions, eh? Just who does the Bitcoin when everyone knows the deal? And furthermore how can Bitcoin be said to be when another thing is how a Bitcoin will?

I’ve seen things like that too but a lot of them have been people using coins that were flagged in some sort of nefarious transaction or people who used shortened/fake versions of their full names or mistyped bank account numbers etc. never had an issue myself. I don’t love the $15k limit but I’ve heard you can call and have that increased.

Most people use USD Tether for this purpose. So on Bittrex you would sell your BTC for USDT and then reinvest when you’re ready.

Bitcoin isn’t revolutionary because it’s fast or cheap, it’s important because it’s decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:09
Bittrex and Binance are my favorites. Binance has a decent mobile app and Bittrex’s website is sort of usable on a phone but kinda annoying. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:41:44
He could send you money through PayPal, then once you send the BTC he can file a chargeback. Then you lose the money and the BTC and potentially have to pay a fee to PayPal.

I guess there’s a chance ISPs could start closing ports to conserve bandwidth which would hurt most cryptocurrencies in that there could potentially no longer be US nodes? Or they could regulate our access to exchanges for some reason?

First heard about it when it was around $10. Thought “it would be funny to buy $100 worth and see what happens” finished my beer and didn’t think about it again until it was around $700. Bought some to donate to a private tracker, bought more to hold. Still holding on for dear life :)

Coinbase is fine but it takes a few months to get your credit card cap over $2500.

Are you saying cameras won't exist in 2021? What are you basing this assumption on? I'd be willing to bet that it will be possible to take photographs long after 2017.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:51:22
Idk it says 2021 so I doubt it was taken in 2017. Are you saying maybe it was taken closer to 2019? I think you’re right, that makes more sense!

Please don’t ask me to explain the difference between fiat and cryptocurrency to you. Just use Google.

Unfortunately way too many people have lied and pulled scams to get people to send them BTC in the past. If you’re really interested in strangers trusting you and sending you money then why not provide some proof that any of this is real?

It’s users. Go ahead and clone Facebook and see how many people show up.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:09:33
Oh, and the best way to take advantage is to make sure your current BTC holdings are stored in a personal wallet that gives you access to your keys BEFORE the 25th. Then sit tight and await instructions after each fork.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:35:51
If you think Bitcoin is anything like any of those currencies then you’re insane.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:08:03
Coinbase doesn’t give you your private keys, so if they don’t create a 2x wallet and put your 2x coins in there then there’s no way for you to access them. They may never create a 2x wallet, or they may do it after things have calmed down—which may be after 2x coins are worthless when you could have sold them sooner for a nice profit. It’s also just a bad practice in general to leave coins on an exchange. Exchanges can get hacked or completely shutdown. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:53:59
Rule of thumb: if something says “free Bitcoin” on it, avoid it like cholera. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:41:55
Are you asking if it’s okay to leave some BTC on an exchange for a while until the dust settles from the recent fork? If so, sure. People leave BTC on exchanges all the time. It’s not ideal, or recommended, but for a short while you’ll probably be fine. The risk comes from your account being compromised or the exchange shutting down. Be sure to enable 2FA on your exchange account for added security.

Up to you man. No one knows what the future holds. Personally, if I didn’t have any BTC now then I’d wait for it to dip under $5k again before buying.

Send your friends LTC if you want to send small amounts and not pay huge fees. BTC is no good for small transactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:38:18
Just be sure you do and never don’t. That’s for certain.

It’s too expensive to be used in daily transactions by the masses. It suits a very niche market right now. Everyday people aren’t going to go out and buy Bitcoin just so they can spend most of it on fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:55:10
Not sure why I got downvoted for answering your question.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:53:32
I mine because it’s free money. It costs me pennies per day to earn appreciating dollars worth of Bitcoin per day so why not? That said, I mine whatever coin is profitable on Nicehash and get paid in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:23:56
Why would amazon go through the hassle to accept a new currency that only a tiny percentage of their customers would even use? Are people who hold Bitcoin going to spend an appreciating asset? Are people who don’t have Bitcoin going to pay more money for something just so they can use Bitcoin? The only people who would use it are people who have been holding long enough to have significant gains, people who are laundering money, and hardcore believers in Bitcoin. That’s such a small percentage of their customers and a portion of this new demographic opens them up to legal issues.

That’s not my strategy. I hold what I have and buy more when I feel comfortable with a new entry target. BTC is at an ATH right now. I wouldn’t feel comfortable buying something when it’s at its most expensive value.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:01:16

Mine a different coin if you want to use your GPU. But to answer your question, yes, if you stop the mining application then your computer will return to normal.

It’s no hassle at all for Amazon to implement Bitcoin? I think it would be a very costly hassle. And for what? Because it’s new and neat? It doesn’t solve any problem for them, it just creates more.

Depending on your setup, you could make a lot more money with another coin. If you have an NVIDIA GPU check out Vertcoin. I’m currently making $1/day (after power cost) from a single GTX 1060.

I doubt Wall Street is buying in at ATH. They’re not new kids. If Wall St investors are going to get in then it’s going to be after the S2X crash.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:53:48
This is where USDT comes in handy. A lot of people have issues with tether, but personally I find it works well for quickly buying and selling BTC without withdrawing to fiat. If you’re wanting to take the USD out and have access to it, then yeah, you’re going to be paying the high fees you already know about.
