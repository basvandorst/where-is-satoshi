So why should Coinbase care ? Bitcoin is a permissionless protocol, you can do whatever please you as long as you follow the rules.
It's the protocol that need to be upgraded in order to process more transactions without user action. For example switching to SegWit or batching transaction needs user action (Coinbase is a user in that case) so it can't be efficient. After Coinbase there will be another and another, this can not end without some action at the protocol level.

Why just not use an other exchange if fees are too high ? There is no need for discussion when there are good alternatives.

It's easy to hate simply because people have different ideas than you, that's how you divide a community and that's sad :(

Does Litecoin have any innovation plan ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:50:52
Your point is invalid because if Coinbase users where using software wallets it would generate the same number of transaction. So it's effectively the users who are spamming the network ?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:36:23
Because it's not, you can send transaction with less than a cent in fee and it will confirm
The median fee is currently 3 cents

You know people can have critical thinking on their own, why would you invest a significant amount of money based on some random twitter account ?

Probably more

Please don’t measure productivity with commits. Every developer should know that

If you watched the documentary even today fees would be way lower than the banking fees
@_date: 2017-01-16 09:56:23
It's because they say in the doc that they had to pay like multiples of 10$
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:30:38
You can't just use a metric. Something reasonable would be each developer/team states what best improvements (performance improvement, new features) they made in the past few weeks/month and you could quickly compare which team is the most productive.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:44:41
There is flaw in the graph : 
With the powerball you effectively loose 99$ but with robot investment you only gain 0.29$ (and 93,97$ with Bitcoin)

If you have the private keys for your Bitcoin addresses (that's your breadwallet passphrase) you will have equal amount of Bitcoin on any fork.
For example if you have 1 BTC now. In the event Bitcoin core team decide to split from Bitcoin Segwit2X you will have the same amount of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Segwit2X.
So the safest strategy is to simply wait and keep your coins on all fork, so if one fail you will still have your coins on the winning fork.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:15:00
Let me visualize that for you :
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:19:53
But Segwit is a new consensus rule right ? If not how Segwit transactions are validated ?

1 - Buy a lot of Bitcoin in Europe
2 - Go to India (~800€ in plane)
3 - Exchange your Bitcoin for cash (and try to don't get robbed)
4 - Come back in Europe

It's more than that just look at the displayed price it is much more than the actual price

make bitcoin great again :p !
@_date: 2016-12-09 11:20:21
I tried and it seems to ask for your name and credit card number but there is no ID verification or such
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:08:55
And what if you have multiple inputs ? 9c is only for one
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:51:59
My personal rule is if you don't own the private key you don't own any bitcoins
@_date: 2016-12-07 08:55:10
I guess buying bitcoin with credit card will be difficult now, let's get back to SEPA transfers
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:13:47
That's because you have taken into account the fee needed to spend the BTC
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:26:17
They can do that ?
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:01:01
But if you only publish empty addresses that you will never use what is the problem ?

It's more "harder to hack Bitcoin Wallet"
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:01:22
Ok, never mind so
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:46:30
I think for such amount you should make a wire transfer (to any exchange or localbitcoin). The issue with credit card is that the exchange must get authorizations to raise the limits.
@_date: 2016-12-17 23:53:08
You just have to send a unused address, you know you can generate as much addresses as you want ?
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:39:26
It will be even better when we could store passwords with the Ledger (I saw it's a projet)

Yeah only invest what you can loose !

A good way to vote would be to consider every user as investors. To vote you put a Bitcoin address and according to the amount stored on the Bitcoin address it put a certain amount of vote. So the richest have the more power

I don't understand this war against ASICS, in the end big miners will just buy thousands of GPU and you computer will still be left in the dust
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:20:59
Problem is transactions in the mempool, if you have hash rate and want to clog the network you don't event have to include transactions in your blocks. You just have to mine empty blocks to produce the same result.
Creating random transaction and broadcast it would be expensive because you never know who will include it in their blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:40:19
So BU is fucking awesome ! Fuck yeah !
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:03:17
In every secure poll system (vote with a Bitcoin address, mine blocks) the richer people have more power, period. If you have a better idea implement it you're rich.

Yes I agree on that
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:57:22
miners are still putting real work into the system (using electricity produced by peoples) one could say the real value of a bitcoin will tend to be the cost of this work
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:03:00
but we can agree that the less work there is on a chain the less security there is and so the less valuable it is
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:24:51
Bitcoin have intrinsic measurable value, and that's the work of the miners. They put real work in creating Bitcoins so it has intrinsic value.
