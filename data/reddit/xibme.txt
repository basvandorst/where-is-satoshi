Unfortunately Satoshi didn't trademark Bitcoin - ownership could have been transfered to the bitcoin core dev team long ago.

Storage costs: 20 GB - those were the days... The videos are about 3 years old and while the mechanics haven't changed, such numbers have. Running a full node takes now more dedication than ever (and always will be?).

So what would the [joke]( be then?

So what is the market capitalization we can expect in 10-20 years then? 
An upper boundary could be "total capitalization of all equities markets worldwide" ranging about ~50 Trillion USD if BTC almost replaces anything else. I don't consider debts, real estate and derivates worth anything (I maybe biased by a certain subprime meltdown) so your number may be higher.
Best case scenario, what market cap do you expect (in order of magnitude)?
