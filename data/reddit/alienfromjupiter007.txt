Technical analysis in stocks works on the basis of patterns of price movement. And there are limits such as circuits, etc. I do understand that the same is possible with bitcoin but doesn't bitcoin have a very volatile and abrupt/patternless movement in the past? How can technical analysis work in such a case?
For fundamentals - generally when you look at a company you look at the prospects of the sector it's in, or the metrics and attributes of that company which point towards potential for growth. But in case of bitcoin - geopolitical and tech advancements are not predictable because bitcoin is something very controversial and widely debated. So we don't really know what's going to happen next.
So my question is that are there really factors which can help traders understand the movement of bitcoins or is this mostly a blind bet or more like a gold rush?

When you say coins live in the exchange it in a different wallet, how does that actually work? How does a coin live somewhere? Is it a file stored in a hard disk?

Even gold has some patterns. It's used as a safe haven when stock markets are volatile. It's widely hoarded in places like India and have a certain fashion value.
How does that compare with bitcoin? My objective here is to try to understand how are traders really trading in bitcoin regularly. I feel like I am missing something important here.

Doesn't sound like a dangerous plan to me, why the FUD around it?

I have heard stories of Bitcoin theft and burglary, how does that happen?

I want to hold half my money for long term and use the other half to trade
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:26:17
Could you ELI5 how that works?

Why do people keep coins in an exchange if they run that kind of a risk?
If I keep my wallet seed written on a piece of paper, where do the coins live in such a scenario? The exchange? It somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:53:15
Does this mean that the purpose of a wallet seed is different from that of a dedicated hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:44:45
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:06:50
Hardware wallet makes sense. A few questions.
1. Is the private key same as the wallet seed?
2. Is the private key itself the Bitcoin? If not what's the Bitcoin exactly?
3. When you say my private keys give me access to my bitcoins - where are these bitcoins located and how is the private key used to recognize that the Bitcoin belongs to me?

Why is a bot required?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:57:55
That's daily monthly or yearly return?

1. Your personal research - what factors are they based on?
2. What's pump and dump?
3. Just curious, why do you want to grow and hodl your bitcoins? I guess you see a significant upward potential, could you share your reasoning behind that?

How can BTC be good at solving disagreements when there is no authority?
Generally in a team, the captain uses his veto in cases of strong disagreements. I don't see that happening here because it's truly decentralised.
Is this a bad thing? a weakness for BTC?

Can someone ELI5 what this chart means?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:47:17


Googled it, didn't find anything useful. Could you elaborate a bit?
