Not to be self-promotional, but I wrote an article answering just this question. Hope it helps:

Thanks -- fixed. I'm having to use dictation software due to a wrist injury and it isn't always accurate.

Well, I did say, "Additionally, the rate at which the supply of Bitcoin increases over the next hundred or so years will also slow — every four years, the number of new Bitcoin being released will be halved, further preserving its buying power."

I've never deleted a comment. Just didn't feel the need to make any until someone made a false statement about me.

Sorry, but posting the full article here would be copyright infringement, so that is not allowed.

No, there was some reason Authy was not secure for this purpose. I will look back at my notes to remember why.

Yeah, the post wasn't advising people to do one thing or another. I did a related post on 10 arguments for investing in Bitcoin. The two posts were just laying out the pros and cons for people. There were no recommendations.

2FA is crucial if you use an exchange, but do NOT use 2FA tied to your phone number: 
Use Google Authenticator or Yubikey.

Hi all, 
Senior editor at Forbes covering crypto. I just wanted to state that this post was written by someone from the Leadership channel who I do not know. I had nothing to do with it. In case you are looking for more researched arguments as to why Bitcoin could be a bad investment, I wrote this article on that topic back in December 2015.  
While obviously outdated, it still basically holds up.

I asked Brad at USV about that and he said they negotiated more flexibility with their LPs in this latest round to be able to do this. A16z declined to talk to me but it seems likely they did something similar.

If you created that, can you delete it? I own the copyright, and that is copyright infringement. Also, I am paid by clicks and so you are literally taking income from me. Can you please remove it asap? Thank you.

Thanks. I've sent DMCA Takedown notices before but they were ignored. They are legally required to take these down. I didn't know about these other links. I can't wait till content creators can manage digital rights to our work on the blockchain. Things like this make me not want to write about Bitcoin ever anymore. I spent so much time on that article.
And about this: "Where can I find this income that I have taken from you? I didn't realize that was even an option and certainly didn't intend to take anything. I would be happy to return the stolen income if you can assist me in locating it." I get paid by clicks. When people steal my work and post it elsewhere for free, I cannot make money from my work. I have no idea how much income I've lost from this one stolen article, or all the stolen articles out there. Depressing. I asked you nicely before to delete the comment with that link. If you could do that, I would very much appreciate it.
