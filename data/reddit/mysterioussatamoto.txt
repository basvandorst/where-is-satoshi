And that's profitable? Unless you get your electricity for free, most of us don't, that's not good enough.

But on slide 32, i think you missed the key point of market reflux. I mean i understand you argument on slide 45 where you talk about justifying it and supporting it with your data but i disagree.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:05:32
Well tbh unless you are over clocking you aren't going to burn up a videocard or CPU faster by mining.  But really, i agree with you that it's not worth it any more. You compete with Data centers now and it's just nuts
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:52:55
Cboe is only offering 6 future products i believe. CME has a ton more and if it is going to have any impact that still be the one to prove it or not. 
There is some manipulation taking place to keep it steady which in turn hurts futures.  ;)
Just watch the trading history to see it. Bots are a wonderful tool.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:06:48
I'm not sure how you get that? If, as they claim, China controls the miners, does that not give them the power to manipulate it? Forgive me if I'm wrong, I'm trying to find the fault with that logic and not seeing it at the moment. I would say any coin could be compromised if a country like China or Russia was able to control the miners. Or am I wrong?

To bad a large number of us are unable to create accounts on GDAX.  We've been trying for a month now with no success and support has been sorely lacking.  
We have not heard from anyone from Coinbase support as of yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:11
Oops sorry..
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:53:58
Why would we want to go public?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:28:09
Thank you for the link.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:44
Wait for it to hit 5000 then buy 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:52:25
We are based in North America
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:42:07
This would be the thing that would kill all cryptos if the U.S. Exchanges are hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:45:22
It will only get worse as governments feel their power threatened.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:31:31
Of course they will because we all saw it on the internet. And as everyone knows, if its on the internet it must be true.  
/s  
So, being serious for a moment, if bitcoin reaches a point where governments can't control it or stop it what do you think happens?  
For example, I believe we are at 21 million wallets right now at last check. If that number reaches 3 billion and the amount of money invested in all crypto-coins reaches the GDP of the U.S. and several other countries, what do you think will happen?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:47
We disagree. When you have the capital to effect the price it can certainly do so. The underlying strategy was to buy up as many bitcoins as JP Morgan could get their hands on. Once they did so they sat on them. Sold some off to make some profit and then wait for the futures market to come into being. Once that happened they purchased contracts shorting them and are now dumping the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:53:10
I can see that but what i was referring to was a thought by many out there of a total world economic collapse. What you referred to only effected certain countries economies.  
The world has NEVER experienced a total world economic collapse. So for anyone, myself included, to claim they know what will happen is just wrong.  imho
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:26:48
Thank you for the suggestion. Yes we set up accounts on coinbase first, then proceeded to create out link the accounts on GDAX. 
It is after this, during the verification phase that the issue happens. No matter the id out how it's sent to GDAX, the error continues to occur.
.    
To those saying they have no issues on their system or with their account setup, that is wonderful however that does not resolve the issue we are experiencing. If it was just one of us i would not worry but this is multiple people in our group.  
In regards to the recommendation to use the android app, again thank you for this recommendation but this is not an acceptable solution not is it one we are able to use.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:58:01
We are all verified on Coinbase. Many of us have had our accounts on coinbase for over 3+ years now and have amassed a substantial number of coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:38:02
You should not feel a need to apologize. Your question was a fair one considering someone provided you with incorrect information. We are here to help bring enlightenment to everyone and there should be no stupid or wrong questions. However please understand that we will offer links in answer to some questions that have already been asked many times. If that happens don't feel like anyone here is trying to minimize your question. It is far easier for us to provide a link in some cases.
May you find that which you seek and may the journey be enjoyable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:11
Not sure why you think that. This is the futures folks finally having an effect on Bitcoin.  It was only a matter of time. They have ALOT of money. We are talking hundreds of millions at some of these trading houses. They can and will move the market just like they do with the normal stock market. Anyone thinking otherwise is only fooling themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:29:14
Um, yeah how in the heck will gold be used as a currency in a total collapse? This is logic that I've never been able to follow that preppers use.  
If things get bad enough to where the dollar and every other currency is worthless then gold will not be worth anything and no one will be taking a hunk of metal for things like food and fuel. Instead food and fuel will become items of value and trade.  
added:  I think the problem is, people that get gold because of fears of a crash don't think through the entire scenario of a total crash. You would see no more stores or other businesses because there would be no way to support them. People wont be trading gold. They will be trading the necessities which are food and fuel. Farmers/Farms would become the new hot thing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:03:59
We find this all rather ironic given that the one of the  original purposes for cyrpto-coins was to remove the middlemen.  
We are curious if any others find this humorous?  
Instead of the banking industry and credit agencies controlling the rates, fees and transfer times.  We now have coin exchanges and mining companies controlling the fees, exchange rates and transfer times.  
We realize this is a gross over simplification of the issues currently facing crypto however it does not diminish the fact that this is the case currently.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:09:58
If you don't mind my asking. What coins do you mine?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:58:19
So how would one convert their bitcoins to this new format? Or is this done automagically?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:08:04
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital currency is a pretty neat idea....
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:23:22
I would also like to add, what would happen to all of the fiat currency that you owned? Say for example you had $10k in stocks or some other investment or even in the bank.  Would that money no longer have value and basically be worthless? If you convert it to BTC and you aren't quick enough wouldn't there be a chance that it could be worthless or at least worth far less than others that converted sooner.

Every bubble stops and comes back twice as strong and so it will be with this one.
Be patient and by Jan we should see sky high prices 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:39
This.
The price will stabilize around 8-10k until close to the end of Jan. Then it will start to shoot up to over 30-40k.
Mark my words
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:16:57
why are you linking a paywall article?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:58:58
This is the futures traders. We can't believe people didn't think they could effect the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:47:01
Make certain you purchase high so you can sell low.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:50
Be prepared to see it go much lower. But don't worry it will climb back up in Jan
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:54:20
This is due to two north Korea hacks and a plethora of other issues all converging at the same time. Simple.. That's it.  
It week drop to the 54% Mark and sit there for a bit. After a while there it will rise back up to new highs. You might see it skirt with 60% loss numbers but not for long.  
Mark my words
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:37:03
Ah, yeah I can see that logic. But I'm talking about these preppers out there hording gold because they think the world economy is one day way from total collapse. Its these folks that are just totally without logic in their thoughts.  
But a complete economic collapse not being possible? Hmm well that's not entirely true. There are certainly ways for it to happen.  
Asteroid impact, World War III, Germ Warfare...  just to name a few.    :)  
If somehow things went completely to crap, I'd be packing up my family and moving to a farm somewhere in the south.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:56:42
Inconceivable 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:33:18
That last guy walks out at the half way point.  ;p
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:43:24
I bought at the first huge drop that was around 8-9k from 20k. I thought about a second drop but the only ones that can really time the drops and rises are the whales as they are the ones controlling it all...  
Edit:  
Before that i bought at 1k..
