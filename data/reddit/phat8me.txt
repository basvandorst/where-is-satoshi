It is.  And it's turned into a conspiracy theory website.  Take what they say with a grain of salt.

Agreed. To add here, two things immediately come to mind:  1)  gold is a much more mature market whereas bitcoin trades similar to a new tech listing.  With regards to price appreciation, hard to compare the two there. 2) gold up ~10% in past couple months and appears to be breaking upward.  That's a healthy move for "times of uncertainty."

Gold IS a stateless global reserve currency.  That's the point of precious metals as opposed to a nation's currency.
not sure what you mean about the superpower comment.  Historically, the nation with the gold has the power.  Introducing bitcoin as a reserve currency would have the same result.

The Bid/Ask quotes should determine the market price.  That's how markets work.  Are you saying they disregard this key logic and set a price of their own?

Sorry, but what's wrong with mt. gox?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:42
Understood.  So the main issue is Mt.Gox is both the largest bitcoin miner/dealer and also acts as the largest pseudo-exchange?  They certainly need to separate the two.  But who separates the two?  You'd need a centralized body regulating this.  Quite the catch-22 for Mt.Gox protesters...

It's called gold and has existed for quite some time.

Looks like we're in the "bull trap" stage of this bubble...

Why not buy precious metals? It's already an accepted form of currency.
