Thanks i read some good posts over there. Im deciding to just buy and hold regardless of fluctuations. Although i heard a convincing argument for the next pop to be around 450.  Of course.... it speculation.

Yeah i was sent over to [finially decided to open an account with coinbase. I bought .2 BTC and plan on just putting in little by little as time passes. As you said, we could see higher than triple digits in a few years.

Live and learn? Doesn't change the fact that this is already beginning to happen. There were so many memes and comments about waiting to buy. The price will find its niche and everyone waiting will sigh in relief a whole new class will enter the market. 
What changes the scenario will be media coverage. The story is old now and future media will have less of an impact until the miracle happens and buy bitcoins is easer than going to the bank and our grandmother will be using them off their ipads. *Then* prepare for the bust.
Save for that I can see a steady ride over time. Dont get me wrong, It will happen again but thats just life.

Ultimately this will result in a fortified Mt. Gox and many other exchanges seeking to gain trust. Its literally the dumbest conspiracy ever.

Looks like you had to ignore his point and I understand why.

To me, this past week was a strong wind that blew Bitcoins seed everywhere. It's clearly going to rise again with more exchanges and more people eagerly waiting to buy or simply just try it.
