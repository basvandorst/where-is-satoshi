Counterparty are here today and have tested couple years. There are also almost ready projects what need start using Smart  Contracts like Storj and Spells of Genesis. Rootstock are mostly in paper and there are not any projects. 
And Counterparty have same security than Bitcoin.

Yes, Rootstock trying to do same thing but Counterparty do it with better security.

@_date: 2016-05-28 21:25:23
This all is possible with Counterparty.

They all can use Counterparty with Ethereum Smart Contracts doing "side chain" with full Bitcoin blockchain security.
