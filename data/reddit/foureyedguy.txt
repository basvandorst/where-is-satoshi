Decentralization is in terms of consensus building mechanism, which has multiple components like miners, consumers, developers, nodes etc. Everyone has to overcome their own bias and participate in the network. More internal conflicts between these players lead to a more robust consensus building mechanism which we are witnessing currently in BTC. If hashpower was all that was needed, BCH would have long won the war. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:01:13
The greatest advantage of Bitcoin is being the **most decentralised network**. People will realize that sooner or later.

And why is that so?
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:59:49
Would love to see that happening. Sadly, most altcoins have their own benevolent dictators. Also, there's no robust consensus building mechanisms due to the lack of internal conflict in other coins when it comes to scaling. Its all happy-go-lucky until something happens and the immutability of a chain is tested. That's when you get to know the real decentralized ones.

Would it make sense to have a daily thread and encourage people to rate low the Coinbase app and put their remarks as "Coinbase needs to implement Segwit and reduce my transaction fees"? Lets hurt them where it hurts. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:52:21
But BTC doesn't have a benevolent dictator who can reverse transactions. Decentralization is in terms of consensus building mechanism, which has multiple components like miners, consumers, developers, nodes etc. Everyone has to overcome their own bias and participate in the network. More internal conflicts between these players lead to a more robust consensus building mechanism which we are witnessing currently in BTC.

It's more complicated than that. Satoshi hasn't written much about how to tackle the massive scaling problems. The white paper is limited to jump starting the currency from scratch. But we are a decade beyond that now. So let's keep Satoshi's protocol as the base and build solutions on top of it.

Keynesian economics and Austrian economics to be precise. Fiat money follows Keynesian model, which is prevalent in our society today and is a relatively new concept, devised in the last century. It focuses on spending as stimulus to growth even if the spending has to be done by accumulating debt. 
Austrian economics is what the world has been following for millennia, an ideal model based on hard money and gold standard. 
Bitcoin follows the Austrian model of economics. You might want to read up on that.

@_date: 2017-08-16 19:05:05


They have already tried doing that in Venezuela. It just drives the market underground (underground markets are a real thing worth billions of dollars)


Because USD is the world's default currency. At least for now. You can also measure it in other currencies. Just treat it as regular FOREX.


Yes. The scarcity is a manufactured one. But not by any government/bank/individual. It's manufactured by the protocol. There are well defined rules that cannot be simply changed. do your research on this.


In countries like Japan and Australia, Bitcoin is legal money now. You should probably look at the rate of adoption in these countries. Things don't just happen overnight.


Bezos didn't make Amazon what it is by being that stupid. Every cryptocurrency out there can be exchanged for each other at rates determined by the market. 'Amazcoins', if it were to be a reality would follow the same pattern. BTW, you can spend bitcoins to buy Amazon gift cards right now and spend them to buy stuff on Amazon. So in a way, Amazon already accepts Bitcoin.


Yep! I can trust the US govt. to do something like that. Exactly why Satoshi is anonymous and Bitcoin doesn't have a central authority. Take your tank out for a spin and try finding the Bitcoin headquarters. 


True that! Meanwhile China (which has invested close to $2 trillion in the US economy) has mega Bitcoin mining farms hooked up to cheap state sponsored electricity. Also, Russian oligarchs have approached Putin to open similar mining farms sponsored by the state. Both these countries are also getting ready to introduce their own blockchain based currencies. Do you understand the implication of such moves?

India already has a yuuuge parallel economy (basically people skipping government rules to avoid paying taxes).

The time for that is gone now. Countries like Japan and Australia have already made Bitcoin legal money. Countries like China and Korea have tried but failed to dissuade their citizens from moving their wealth into Bitcoin. Not to mention the growing adoption in Europe.
The cherry on top is the recent news of the Russians trying to build massive mining farms much like the Chinese, with the help of the state. Looks like they see a new world currency system in the horizon. At some point in the future, the US might try pulling off a few dirty tricks to stop cryptocurrencies, but all they would achieve is driving the US crypto market underground. The rest of the world would be carrying out business as usual.

Mt Gox and the bitcoin protocol are two very different things. You need to understand what the bitcoin protocol is to see the value in it. 
As far as Mt Gox is concerned, it was a point at the edge of the btc protocol where the protocol comes in contact with the fiat system. Such points generally call for you to put your trust in them (essentially a human being somewhere) and when you do that you are prone to the affects of human error. That's why btc holders always stress on holding your own coins, essentially trusting your own self. People who did that were not affected by mt gox.

I concur with all your points except for


No system can be perfect from the beginning. It gets better with each iteration. Bitcoin has been around for a decade now. So the foundation isn't "weak". The current fight is to preserve the decentralized nature of the network. And no one else is going to do that except for the current network participants who care for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:25:23


Bitcoin is to be treated as a financial commodity, profits have to reported and taxes paid accordingly.


Dollar depreciates over time due to continuous massive printing by the FED. Bitcoin has a fixed cap and hence appreciates over time.


First of all, never leave your coins on the exchange. "Not your keys, not your bitcoins". If coinbase were to crash, the price of Bitcoin would also crash. It would take some time,  but the price would climb up again. I am not sure about the time frame. It might take up to an year. Thousands of people outside of the US are also into Bitcoin and they don't use Coinbase.


This would result in greater awareness and acceptance of bitcoin in wall street. It would push the price upwards. However, with the entry of large financial institutions, we might witness market manipulation on larger scale. This won't have much effects in the long term but might increase volatility in the short term.


Using cryptocurrencies would be the norm. It would be similar to how people treat the internet in today's world. There would be thousands of cryptocurrencies. Every company would there might have their own "tokens". You would have apps to design and launch your own tokens/currencies for specific purposes. The concept of "streaming money" would be mainstream. Grandmas will be tipping satoshis to their grandchildren for the funny cat gif that they have created.

Cryptocurrencies are only as good as the security of their blockchains. None of the additional features matter if the underlying blockchain is not secure and immutable. No other blockchain comes even close enough to bitcoin in this regard. 
As far as additional features are concerned we are soon going to have instantaneous, anonymous, super cheap transactions because of additional layers like the lightening network. Layers like MAST are laying the ground for smart contracts on top of the bitcoin chain. It's basically like building a whole new ecosystem and connecting it to the most secured network in the world for security. Not sure how the alt-coin scene would look like in a few years when most of their key features would be available in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Yes! As of now, most people entering the network are here to speculate. I don't mind it as long as the network is getting more users and people are getting acquainted with cryptocurrencies.


This should be the real use of Bitcoin. We all agree. This has been hindered a lot because of the high transaction fees. Hopefully with the introduction of LN, we will see advancement in this.
Also, people are hodling Bitcoin because they use their hard earned useless fiat to acquire it. With more adoption we will reach a stage where you can opt to get paid in Bitcoins. That should motivate people to spend bitcoin more.

I agree with every word. India could leapfrog decades in terms of tech./development/economy if we were to adopt crypto faster. But the problem is I don't really see this revolution happening any time soon. In fact there was a expert I was watching the other day who claimed that India would be one of the last countries to adopt, by the time bitcoin touches $ 20k or more. Perhaps we at such forums should take an initiative. The best way to go forward would be to raise awareness among youngsters/teenagers/students. They would readily grasp the concept, unlike people in the age group of 25+. What do you think could be done to bootstrap the process?
I guess the best way to go forward would be to engage with anyone from the lower age groups who are remotely interested in programming. As I had mentioned earlier, engineering colleges should be fertile ground. These kids could grasp the concept, take part in programming if they are keen enough, or at least introduce the concept in their localities/communities, convince their *kiranawala* shops. Perhaps someone could develop an opensource wallet wherein people get commission out of the charges when they introduce new people to the ecosystem. Not a one time thing, rather for every transaction. I know it has a cringy MLM ring to it, but greed is a great motivation, right? I am no developer. But I am convinced that developers need to be at the forefront of this thing, if we were to have any hope of moving to a crypto-economy any time soon. Would creating another sub-reddit for people ready to act work?

Isn't that what mainstream consumerism is all about? I expect such things to increase if we are heading towards large scale adoption.

There's no definite answer on this. The government hasn't decided yet. But it has not been declared illegal and companies like Zebpay are functioning legitimately.

You might have to rethink on that.

Thankfully Andreas Antonopoulos hasn't been corrupted yet.

Investment from the rich means value of bitcoin goes up, which is good news for us middle and low class schmucks.

I have the same question.

Noob here. I understand it's a bad idea to buy Bitcoin after August 1st. One should be waiting for the dust to settle. 
My question is, should I be buying any between the 21st and 31st of July? Would there be any danger because of so many multiple signalling nodes?

Altcoins speculations depend a lot on Bitcoin speculations. Whenever Bitcoin goes down, altcoin speculators start dumping.

There are going to be a lot of people coming in soon, after the now-ever-nearer everything-bubble burst in the US and its implications all around the world. It would be nicer if we had a few solutions by then to make transactions easier and simpler. People might just use it for more than HODLing.
