Unless you consider ASICMiner coming online. But yeah, we're still pretty early in the ASIC mining transition. My GPU is definitely still hashing.

I had to look [this one]( up, ha!

Right you are, perhaps this is what I was thinking.

"The group said the move was due to Bitcoin quickly becoming the preferred digital currency of the Internet, as well as its employees requesting to be paid in Bitcoin."

Say that the volume coinbase does in trading eventually exceeds that of MtGox, would that not effect where the price of Bitcoin is maintained?

Perhaps it was a bit antagonistic

My bad... thanks for the correction!

Right you are good sirs - fixed.
I had intended to use milli (10^-3) as that would be the next logical transition in measuring Bitcoin.
Now the title is really bothering me...

I've never really checked out BTCjam before, looks pretty cool. I'm torn whether to help this guy out or put more money into my own mining operation...

They do have a pretty nice interface, you've gotta give them that. It'll be interesting to see if more people join in and just how difficult it is now to set up a new mining pool.

I believe this will be as much dependent on how the Bitcoin community reacts as on how the Governments act. I've read a lot of posts about Bitcoin where people seem to project their ideal social change on the currency. It's as though Bitcoin's adoption will transform society into some sort of pseudo utopian state. However, many of these idealists are at odds with each other, not to mention external political forces.
Bitcoin stands a better chance at long term adoption if it is treated as a technological progression rather than political activism. Likewise, the nature of the protocol (deflation vs inflation, decentralization, etc.) will likely have positive societal effects regardless of whether or not individual social ideals are attached to it. 
Truly disruptive technologies seem to follow similar progressions of adoption. They come about in different, somewhat random ways but usually involve tinkering and collaboration. After creation they take on a life of their own as early adopters fit the technology to new purposes. Following early adopters are financial opportunists. With Bitcoin it seems as though we're in the early adopter stage, transitioning into financial opportunists. While central bankers most certainly won't be promoting Bitcoin, currency traders and day traders might. Getting Bitcoin into the hands of these people would mean that part of the financial industry has a vested interest in the technology. After big money moves into such a technology, political influence is likely to follow. From here this technology will be adapted and pushed into the hands of the general public.
However, this could go considerably differently if Bitcoin is treated rigidly as a means protest against the state. In that case we could see considerable more opposition from governments and a stunting of Bitcoin's growth.
tl;dr If Bitcoin is treated purely as a technology the transition may go more smoothly. If it is presented as anti-establishment, anti-government, then we may be in for a bumpy ride.

This is awesome to see, right on man!
