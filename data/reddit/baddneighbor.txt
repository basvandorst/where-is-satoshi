I understand a progressive tax, but when it is super aggressive it creates less incentive. Do you know how many jobs Bill Gates has created because of his wealth? I have no problem with it. And he is doing what most billionaires should be doing by spending his wealth in great ways, but he definitely is entitled to do with it what he wants. 
Also, he worked smarter, not harder. If a factory worker can work smarter and start a side business or be an entrepreneur and make a ton, that stimulates the economy. There is more incentive to do so if progressive taxes are less aggressive.

Where is your incentive to work harder then? Why work hard and make more if I will actually make less of my extra income?

As someone who recently dismantled a mining rig with several cards on it and also games a lot on my PC, I have some experience and advice for you!
I would build your gaming/editing rig the way you want it and simply run nicehash on it while not using your computer for gaming/editing. If you are browsing the web or typing a document, leave it running in the background. Nicehash allows you to mine several altcoins with your GPU and CPU at the same time. It also converts everything to BTC and deposits into any BTC address weekly. 
The reason I say you should look at it this way is that you will want to get a 1080ti over SLI 1070s. SLI is not always supported, and when it is, it often isn’t better than using a similar card or maybe even a 1080. I can’t speak to how the SLI might work with editing. 
I had a mining rig with 3x 1060 and 1x 1080 on it and I make more now on two gaming rigs with a 1060 and a 1080 in them because the CPUs are powerful. (Ryzen 1400 andRryzen 1600.)
Also, I would highly consider looking at a 1440p screen since the resolution is amazing but the frame rate will exceed 60fps with a 1080ti. 4K will likely average about 55-60 FPS on AAA games.
Edit: if you are willing to drop some coin on a mining rig separately, you can get away with a motherboard that will support 8 cards, a crappy G3900 processor, a stick of ram, and a wooden frame.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:22:34
Haha damn iPhone! Edited.
That makes more sense. As I was typing it out I was thinking the real use I would get out of this would be a wallet on my phone. I'll have to download Eclaire then. Have you used it? How is it? Security?
It's funny because I would keep small amounts on Eclaire for use when out and about but keep most of it on my hardware wallet at home. Just like using a bank/atm except I am in control. Gotta love BTC.
Edit: I just realized you said it is for Android. Are there any iOS LN wallets?

If lightning is perfected, I can see ebay and amazon actually accepting BTC. But we need lightning or it may just damage the BTC image when fees go up and transactions take too long.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:07:53
It’s more about making sure there are no third parties in your transactions. I can send you value directly without having a company process that. Banks have their hands on all the transactions right now, taking their cut on every single one. (Directly or indirectly) in a world where we only use crypto, the only people that take a cut of our transactions are miners, and in hopefully very small amounts. (Fractions of cents)

Why is local bitcoins at $27k? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:14:29
It is $3,000 and will probably produce $10 a day at most with something like NiceHash. And that amount will only go down per day. So you're looking at probably 1.5 to 2 years to get your money back. By then, you would have probably made thousands just throwing the $3k into bitcoin and leaving it. 
Source: I built a mining rig and missed out on a ton of gains because i should have just bought bitcoin instead.

Congrats! Do yourself a favor and head to gdax and log in with your coinbase credentials there. You can transfer your coinbase balance to gdax for free (they are the same company) and withdraw for free since they pay your transaction fee for you. 
Also, if you are looking to store those coins safely, check out the trezor and ledger nano s hardware wallets. They keep your private key offline and therefore very safe! 
If you are looking to sell any off, I would use gdax as well. 
Congrats, sir!

This is so dumb to me because it could ultimately hurt the price of bitcoin much more, losing them more money than they are making doing this.... they are essentially biting the hand that feeds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:47
Right now, it is better for large transactions. A $3-5 fee is too much for buying a coffee, but it is great for sending $1M across the world in a few minutes. 
This will be addressed with the Lightning Network with bitcoin. Also, other coins such as ethereum and litecoin can scale much higher and have lower fees so, in theory, they would be a better currency. But bitcoin is the face of crypto, so if it can adapt to be like those coins with super low fees via the lightning network, it will be a viable currency. I believe this will create a much higher valuation for bitcoin.

But how can we trust that any of the high fives are real? Maybe we should use blockchain technology to validate high fives over the internet. And maybe we can assign value to the high fives, but it will only be a value assigned by the market.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:37:29
Yep! I wanted to own the coins because if  real ETF were announced for bitcoin, I don't see GBTC going up any more since people would rather own actual coins than something based on them. That's the main reason I left. It is nice to hold something that resembles BTC in a retirement account though!

Another quick question. Will I be able to use LN and send payment to a normal bitcoin address? Does it have to be a specific LN address?

I’m amazed by this, too. One of the bread guys came on this subreddit about 6-8 months ago and responded to me telling me it was in the works. Guess not!

Question for you: how hard is it for services to implement this technology? Let’s say for instance if I have a Trevor wallet and want to pay for something online with this. Does it take a lot of work for TreZor to implement this? Also, is it difficult for whatever website I may be purchasing from to accept lightning payments?

For every bitcoin you had, you got the same amount of bitcoin cash for free. That’s what a dork does. It was actually a good thing for coinbase TJ finally give you your bitcoin cash. This means that as of August 1, 2017, you had 0.77 BTC in the account.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:16:56

You can place a limit order above the "market price" in gdax right now. But it likely won't go through unless more people are willing to buy at that price.
I am assuming the best way to sell off now is to place a market order as soon as trading begins.

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:57:56
There are! But there is no need for them, necessarily. We really just need an exchange to be able to get bitcoins from people who have mined them, and there are several! But if the economy were run on bitcoin alone, exchanges would go away since you would earn your income as bitcoin. For now, they definitely do have a large segment of the bitcoin economy, which can definitely be concerning. They are not regulated, though. So that is a huge plus. Banks = government.

I would imagine it would open the possibility for them to allow for larger discounts/rewards since they will save money on transaction costs.

I bought at 680 or so, it immediately went to 900 and then back down to 680 even though bitcoin was rising. I dumped it and bought bitcoin because now I actually own the coins. Best decision ever. It is “based on” bitcoin price, which is bs. It accounts for roughly .09 BTC per share. Or it is supposed to, at least.

I agree, less expensive and better looks, but I think you're confusing the boot being carbon fiber, not containing water. The M4 GTS has the water tank in the trunk for the vapor cooling feature in the engine. This was a great way to cool the engine. It produced the most powerful engine from BMW per liter yet.

Hey! Thanks for that. i honestly didn't know coinbase was ever going to honor BCH. I left a small balance in when the fork happened, so happy to know something will come to me down the road. I didn't care at first because it was a small amount, but BCH seems to have some momentum right now. If it grows into something big, I may have a nice surprise in 2018. So thanks!

Hey! I checked out your site and it looks pretty sweet, but I noticed on the dice that even if I put super high odds of hitting, I always am deposited the full amount I bet into my fake BTC balance rather than the payout amount. (On every win, of course) Therefore, my fake winnings always go up. Is this just a glitch? Or is there something I am missing?

Definitely not profitable to 99% of the population unless you create a better miner yourself or get free electricity and access to a ton of miners. (Talking about bitcoin mining) Even then you’d most likely be better off just buying bitcoin. 
I mined with 4 graphics cards using nice hash. I did the math and if I would have just bought, I would have made about $2k more than I did. I broke even, but what’s the point when you could have invested to make more!

This is actually a big TIL for me. Thanks. I didn’t know how nodes really worked.

True! But that M badge is worth what? Like 20k?
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:56:07
Yep! Same. Had the app but never used it.

My reminder just went off. Any luck with this? I don’t expect you to give actual numbers, but knowing you made it big or not would be cool!

Careful. We don't want to accidentally start a new MLM network!

Don’t let your laptop be connected to the internet when you plug a drive in!

What about using bread wallet? Any idea?

Check out bitcoinwisdom.com and see their difficulty adjustments. It looks like around 5% average increase per adjustment. 
You also have to take into account where you think bitcoin will be in 6-7 months, which could almost offset difficulty increases completely. It depends on the price!

It’s only illegal if you’re doing it to change it into another bill or to change it to be unusable. Marking it is not.

Not the X5 M.... must have sold a bit early! /s

This one time bitcoin CRASHED to 60, then it went to 200, then it CRASHED to 130, then it went to 2000, then it CRASHED to 800...

Quick noob question. If I want to use lightning, do I absolutely have to set up my own node? Can I use somebody else's?
Edit: I appreciate all the replies guys. Unfortunately I have an iPhone. I was hoping to use LND thinwallet and plug a node in. I am really hoping iOS becomes LN friendly soon so I can start using it!

It’s a BMW with a Toyota badge.

Are you akin to bitcoin pumps?

Yep except for the interior. Seats and trim are Toyota. Pretty much all functioning parts are BMW.

Mine came like that straight from the MFG. Maybe not as bad but it didn’t look packaged like a new iPhone all clean and fresh looking. I just dismissed it since they aren’t a billion dollar company like Apple.

I don’t think it’s selfish. It is a valid question to ask, especially when you believe most people will accept it eventually.

Go home, dad.
