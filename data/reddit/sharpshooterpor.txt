i've sold btc twice on localbitcoins with paypal, i wait till i see money on my paypal and then release the coins. why is it the scammer's dream?

wondering the same
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:39:58
ofc i always go with someone with 100% and a lot of trades. but how is it reversible? for example, the last trade i did, as soon as I got the money on paypal, i payed an order on ebay even before releasing the coins. so the money i used to money i had received from the trade seconds after it got into my account. how can they reverse that?

the transactions im waiting for is to buy minereum!! i bough at 0.90$, it went up to 6$, i hodled and then down to 2$ and I sold because I'm a stupid fucking weak hand. Now it's at 11$ and I wanna buy more, it really has potential

Localbitcoins.com is pretty easy to me. Just apply the right filters and you're all set
