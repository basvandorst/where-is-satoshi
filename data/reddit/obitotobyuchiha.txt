As a Venezuelan who's been using Localbitcoins for almost two years I thank you! I was not aware of this.

I can barely hear what she says but here's an [article]( about it. In a nutshell, you can only use fiat (USD) to buy BTC and Dash through this ATM and not the other way around for the time being.

It's almost impossible to live on a $2 monthly wage but that's just the minimum wage, everyone who has managed to survive this long (and I'm not exaggerating by using the term 'to survive') has had a side gig or two because that's the only way to survive. You can't support yourself with a traditional job unless you have ties with the government (aka you're a corrupt piece of shit).
I consider myself pretty lucky to have had spent 12 months of allowances on my English skills when I was a teenager back in 2012 when our bananas economy wasn't so bad. This allowed me to make friends from overseas and it was through one of my friends that I got my first side gig: playing a MMORPG called "RuneScape" for other people (aka boosting their accounts). 
I was able to make $40-60 a week thanks to my side gig but in order to make as much money I had to drop out of school, which is something I'm not proud of but I had to do it. 
I'm currently learning a few programming languages for both backend and frontend web development and my friend is supporting me and my family as I learn these languages. He's been supporting me and my community since Q1 2019 and I have nothing but good things to say about him. I know I will repay him one day.
So, yeah, you can't live on $2 months, you can only survive.
