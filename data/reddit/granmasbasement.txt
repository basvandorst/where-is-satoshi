I guess i didn't ask the question clear enough, because the bitcoin protocol is anything but unstable. The value of said bitcoins is currently unstable but the protocol itself is one of the niftiest pieces of code in recent memory. It would seem you speak from a position of ignorance. If my coin had been in mt gox i would be upset, however anyone with half a brain knows to store their coins in cold storage and not on an exchange lol. No one is saying this isnt the wild west of investing, most people realize this, we just don't care. Especially those like me who bought in at such a low price and have already made their money back 10X. Vitriol from the likes of you is clearly and concisely about you trying to make yourself feel better about missing an opportunity.  Bitcoin as a protocol has a societal benefit that we wont see until/if it becomes more mainstream but the idea behind it is revolutionary, if you can't see that then you simply don't have a strong understanding of the current economic structure that fiat currency imposes on people. Do some research, the benefits to the people are clear cut.  I'll give you some advice.... you havent missed the boat yet....there are some really promising crypto's on the horizon... check this site out  if you have any questions i would be happy to field them.

So now you're just going to babble about nonsense? You've got some issues that sound like they need working out. Clearly this has been waste of my time, trying to enlighten you about bitcoin and crypto currencies whilst you talk about cocaine and someone named keates. Either you think this is a big joke or you need to get some professional help asap, either way you should stay out of the bitcoin debate as you have nothing of value to offer.

I don't know what to say to you, do you want to talk about bitcoin or this guy keates? You sound like a paranoid schizophrenic, I mean I've seen some creative ways to dodge a question but this tops it. Insisting I am keates doesn't make you any less ignorant on this subject.

I think you are very confused..... not surprised though based on the way you approached this post, from a position of ignorance and seething jealousy over something you apparently have no vested  interest in. You never did answer my questions, I can only assume that means you don't know the answers to them, which really puts you in a very poor position to speak on bitcoin.

I wouldn't normally do this but you seem harmless enough when it comes to computers and shit i just want you to eat your words. Would a skype chat convince you I am not this keates person? How foolish you are going to feel. I am home in a few hours let me know.....

I don't think I said anything about the merits of bitcoin as an asset class or currency. We could certainly get into that conversation though. Tell me what do you know about the bitcoin protocol? Why is it inherently worthless, as you claim?
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:24:28
Why would you do that? What does this have to do with bitcoin? Now I am confused.

Well first of all bitcoin isn't a currency exclusively, it certainly can be used that way however. As far as laughing at us all.... does that count the ones that bought  in a 10 dollars a coin or how about the miners that invested next to nothing and are making off like bandits? I think in all reality you are just jealous that you weren't aware of this opportunity sooner. even with todays prices Im still up ten's thousands of dollars due to bitcoin.... who's laughing now? Chew on this a year ago today bitcoins were worth 30 dollars a coin, now currently worth 550 a coin...... i bought in around a year ago...... who's laughing again?
