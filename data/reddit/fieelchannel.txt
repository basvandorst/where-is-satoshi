I thought that it would be a better idea to have a basic client, you know, the original one. What you mean by "best beginners wallet"?


I already have an awesome machine i use for video-editing and gaming,  in the other hand i have no idea how mining works, so..

Slush's  POOL at the moment! And yes i'm using Minepeon, it's web interface is utterly awesome. At the moment the earning are really minimal, [this is the amount - more or less - i made with my raspberry for 2 days](
I'm planning on adding more miners though, this was just the beginning, i wanted to be sure to have a working client before jumping into it :)
EDIT: [here's another screen, this time of the graphs](

I was interested from the beginning, i kept hearing about bitcoins and similars for quite some time now and decided that i wanted to know exactly what the business was about!
EDIT: i've been studying business and economics until this year and i really wanted to know how this market works, believe me or not but the bitcoin system is completely different from anything else i have ever studied, it seemed.. fascinating! :)

Done! Always glad to help :)

bitcoin core synched and everything, but to be honest i don't see any improvement from Electrum, what am i able to do with the core client that i can't with simpler ones?
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:51:38
Thank you, gonna drink it and cheer at you tonight my friend! :D
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:19:29


mind elaborating? :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:34:12
What about mining other currencies? Is there a point?
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:19:44
Well, seems like a good thing for now :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:15:36
I already ended synching the whole 20 GBs, other than that what can i use the original client for? I have it ready on my main Desktop.
I installed Electrum on my laptop and i'm currently using that wallet! Let me understand: the coins i have on my Electrum wallet will be there and i won't find them anywhere else (nor in the bitcoin core, or Blockchain.info wallet because they all have different addresses?) For example if i want a blockchain.info wallet i simply have to transfer my coins from my electrum wallet to my blockchain.info wallet using its address? There is no way to synch wallets between my computers? Thank you for your time answering my noob questions man! :)

At the moment [~2Gh/s!]( My plan is to keep adding hardware :D
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:18:13
Thank you so much! My first coins on my wallet :D, now my balance isn't 0 BTC ahah! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:29:39
Thank you ! :D
