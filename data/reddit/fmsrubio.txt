I mean he'll be 74 by the time December 2020 arrives.  And he's lived a helluva life. Might as well celebrate that Bitcoin has become a success, and give up his penis which he wouldn't be using much anymore anyways. I'm not sure about the "on national TV" part of the deal though, as broadcasting that would get any station sued to death by the FCC, lose all of  its viewers, be shut down forcefully in the middle of the transmission or worse. I can see it being on a live Internet site though, wouldn't break any law and they could set it up to advertise the URL waaay beforehand so as many people as possible jump into the stream as soon as  it begins.

Yeah but I don't mean just spending his coins, that's just one of the things he could do, I mean speaking out and saying something (from a medium where it can be confirmed it's him and not some impostor). If he managed to somehow prove he's the same person who spoke in 2009 (hence the Nakamoto we're going after), anything he said afterwards regarding Bitcoin could have a huge impact on the network.

Well, to  be fair, the original Bitcoin whitepaper hosted by Satoshi Nakamoto on  (still available) and later reuploaded by Roger Ver/BCashers to  (don't know why, maybe just to speed up the public's general adoption of the concept of Bitcoin before brainwashing them into recognizing the coin with ticker BCH as the one and only, official "Bitcoin"?) lists Satoshi's website on the first page (along with his name and his email address) as " So I guess it is the closest to being the official site, though I do agree there is none that is  actually the official, but given there isn't, the closest  experience we can get to "official" is

I think what he means by "consider it lost" and "focus on something else" is if you mind your Bitcoin too much, with its ups and downs, you might make a bad decision such as sell at a low price or buy high, etc. But instead, if you just keep your private keys in the back of the freezer for instance, and  set  a reminder  in your calendar for  5 years,  you  will almost surely have multiplied your money. And if you haven't, at least hopefully the laws and regulations, the  word of mouth and spread of fame, and the advances in mobile  easy payment  tecnologies will have lead society to almost unanimously accept Bitcoin as an everyday currency, so you can go outside and buy bread at your local bakery 200 feet from your home in a small town paying with Bitcoin.

Exactly my thoughts, for instance my account is almost 5 months old but I have only really been using  Reddit since  about 1 month ago, so I'm more of  a newbie than someone who has a 2 month old account that they've been using since the beginning. Point being, account age =/= user's Reddit experience.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:09:00
Thanks for the clarification, but my point about the relative placing of "the bottom" still holds, as there is almost no difference between $0.00, $0.0041 and $0.01. The thing to consider is Bitcoin was, as any other starting currency, virtually valueless, but has come to reach about $20k a piece, so there is in fact "a bottom", which would be below $10k, such as now.
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:40:04
Yeah, the best way to maintain the value of any currency is to give it legitimacy in the eyes of its users. Of course, in the case of gold and Bitcoin, it helps that they are (almost) infinitely dividable. While a gram of gold goes for around $35, you can get for instance a standard deck of 54 plastic, 24 carat gold-plated playing cards  on Amazon for about $7, because the amount of gold they contain is so ridiculously thin/light/small it's worth next to nothing, yet these cards keep the positive qualities of gold, mainly looking awesome when shining to sunlight, and also being sturdy, but I suspect this latter one is more because of the underlying plastic. Meanwhile, Bitcoin can be divided to such an extent  that, even if it were one day worth one million U.S. dollars ($1,000,000), one Satoshi would only be worth one U.S. dollar cent (a penny), or $0.01.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:33:00
There is no true bottom in the price, but what there is is the history of prices, so right now I'd personally consider "bottom" (as in good place to buy) to be in between highest ever price ($20k) and lowest ever ($0.01), i.e. 10k. So now for instance  would be a good time to buy, because historically the current price is  below average/median/whatever you wanna call 10k.

It's not like owning at 200 makes you a millionaire, you know. Even if someone had 1BTC when it was at 200 and sold it at 20k, that's still only $19,800. Surely, it helps deal with everyday spendings, but it's not such a fortune that it will make you rise in socioeconomic class. For someone to actually have enough money to live without working from 20 to 80, they'd require at least profits of $3,000,000 (60 years at an average spending of $50,000 per year) and the amount of people who have made that much money from selling BTC is so ridiculously low, it is not worth mentioning.

No worries my dude, I'm not a huge expert on wallets either, I've just used a ton of different wallets, but that doesn't mean I can't be the one in the wrong. Maybe my experience is just coincidentally like this, but the general panorama of wallets is not.

Note: for the densest out there, the above user is the OP, not this thread's, but the Twitter post's. So I correctly predicted what his mum did, but before he replied and we knew, a few people had downvoted me.

Nobody knew the price was gonna drop after $20,000. As it happens with any unprecedented price rise, nobody knows quite exactly where it's gonna stop rising and start falling again. So, now in hindsight you know it was a mistake back then to not sell, but back then nobody knew.
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:43:12
She probably has an app like Coinbase where it tells you the exact fiat value of your stored Bitcoins, without you having to do the calculations yourself. So, say she has 0.03 BTC, which is now around $200, but back then was less than $30; she'd look at the little number beside her stored amount 6 months ago, mentally annotate it, and then after doing so again now, she knows.
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:36:08
Sure, I'm not denying that, but still, it's psychologically hard to assume you've lost a ton of money, so people just held on to their empty hopes in a vain attempt to see the price rise again, and they didn't know when to stop hoping and just sell. It happens a lot, and it gives Bitcoin a bad public image. I'm glad it didn't happen to me though, I had been planning to buy since before it rose to peak, but thankfully by the time I saved up enough, it had went down again. So if I sold now, I would only have very small losses. Unless it keeps going down and gets much worse, at some point at least I'll reach breakeven.

Stupid question I suppose, but could someone ELI5 to me why can't all countries simply "neutralize" or "cancel out" a predefined amount of debt to improve the situation? Like every country agreeing on erasing $100 million of their debt seeing as we can't possibly all owe it to someone other than Earth countries. I'm clueless

Hey "redditor for a day", HODL is an acronym for "Hold On for Dear Life". But at its conception it wasn't an acronym, that came later. At the beginning it was just an accidental misspelling of the word "hold" on a BitcoinTalk forum thread. It essentially means to keep your bitcoins instead of spending them or selling them, so you eventually gain more money than you had to put to buy them. Over the course of the years, HODLing has proved to be rather effective, albeit hard to do, as it requires patience. But there's a lesson to be learned: until you sell below your buying price, you haven't lost anything, you've just transferred your assets to a slightly less liquid form.

But wouldn't 'living the life that you want' imply that by 2020, you could get by with just paying things with Bitcoin instead of selling it for fiat first? And that your debt collectors will gladly accept BTC to settle the debt? TBH it's kinda paradoxical you'd keep the rest of the Bitcoin after selling what you need to live, because if you couldn't live directly through that Bitcoin, then that means that the rest you have is functionally useless, no matter how high the price. Either you are in this only for the fiat cash and sell all of your Bitcoin, or believe in it as a form of payment and don't sell any of it, but that middle ground? That's just contradictory.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:43:19
Yes. Also 1 BTC = 1 million dollars. 1 mBTC = $1,000. Pretty convenient price, matches everywhere

Settled?  If you bought 100 BTC them for $0.01 each or mined them at no cost, and sold them at $20,000, you have $2,000,000. That's not so much in the long run. Not everyone is smart with  money and/or knows how to invest, so for most people 2 million will be pretty short over the long run. I'd require at the very least 3 million to consider myself 'settled', in the sense that I could live 60+ years after getting the money, and into my natural aging death, all the while not lacking any basic need on the long run. You have to consider there  is one person whose fortune exceeds one hundred billion dollars, there are about 3,000 people with fortunes exceeding 1 billion dollars , about 150,000 people with 100 million dollars or more, about 8 million people with 10 million dollars or more, and about 120 million people with 1 million dollars or more. These days, 1 million is nothing.

I dunno man, in my experience only wallets that are not "true" wallets (i.e. store your private keys themselves and  only give you access to the coins under their terms, and let you buy and sell with fiat directly to your wallet) i.e. exchanges, do this. Most "offline wallets", as you call them, which are actual wallets because they store the private keys physically in your own hard disk in a .dat file, like Bitcoin Core or Electrum, which are the smartest ones to use as even if all crypto companies go bankrupt you still got your money, don't do anything of the like,  because  thet don't appeal to the general public like the aforementioned exchanges, and their goal is not to make money from Bitcoin, but they appeal to us geeks and their goal is to use it as it was intended, as a currency to mine it, buy things with it, get paid for your job with it or sell things for it, just like you would do with dollars, without ever using dollars to buy or sell the bitcoin itself, because that defeats its purpose.

Well, I just replied to another user who thought the same as you, and I thought s/he was the exception, but seeing as you think that too, I'm starting to think I may be the one in the wrong here after all. It's just I've used a TON of different wallets, and be it mobile, desktop, web, paper or even hardware wallet, I thought it was quite rare for them to do that. But again, seeing the redundance, I guess I'm wrong. If so I apologize. Actually what the heck, I  apologize anyways even if I'm actually right, because at least the general public opinion/thought is contrary, so the wallet makers are in the fault for not advocating the correct public image. Sorry.

Hell yeah, outside of that hypothetical comic scenario, I'd give way more than one thought  in exchange for 1 BTC. That's approx €5,000, hell if we count each individual piece intellectual work as 'thoughts', then everyday in my workplace I sell about 500 thoughts for much less than that!

Wouldn't that be a paradox, since "I think bitcoin is stupid." is a thought, thus he's implicitly accepting the Bitcoin in exchange for it, yet at the same time refusing it, because of the content of the thought?

Really bad things would happen. That's why we hope the scenario you described doesn't ever happen in the first place; and the collective hope of everyone that it will not happen is what makes it not happen. The correct  functioning of the whole system is pretty much based on everyone's credibility that it will function properly.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:52:03
I just buy a pre-set small amount of BTC every now and then without looking at the price (well unless obviously it went crazy high, like $50k, or crazy low, like $100). That way over a period of say 3 years, my average buying price is roughly the same as the coin's average fluctuating price during that period, so it's the fairest price I could get. I also pre-load a huge amount of fiat yearly on the exchange platform, so I can buy without the hassle of having to go through the whole process of a wire transfer/credit card payment.

But death is still guaranteed, even if you manage to successfully rack up operation after operation that prolongs your life, at some point you are gonna die of an unnatural cause, unless you stay underground sitting doing nothing forever. Also you could naturally mutate into something that cannot be recovered, or hell seeing as you have no telomeres in this scenario, maybe even evolve. Earth being inhabitable etc. Lots of things could happen. But death is indeed guaranteed, no matter if you can live and breathe in space at some point the whole universe will die from lack of entropy. Homeostasis cannot sustain itself forever, in an ideal scenario maybe 200 billion years if placed in a big, self-sustaining, continously-evolving giant blob of biomass floating somewhere in space, but at some point it's gonna die.

Well, technically you are contributing, since every individual transaction you perform gives/takes an asset from someone else, and this in a much larger scale creates value for people.
