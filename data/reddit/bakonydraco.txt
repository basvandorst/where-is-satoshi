Lol and speaking of schillings, look where they ended up.

This looks most similar to the Space Shuttle, which never got out of low earth orbit. That craft is not designed to escape Earth orbit, or even reach geosynchronous orbit, and would eventually fall back to Earth.

By my estimation, the bigger block has sides 1.41 times that of the smaller block, so the volume is 2.81 times greater.  Maybe it's 7 times as dense?

If a Toaster can win an NBA Championship, surely it can be an altcoin.

It was a Clay Millennium Prize, there's no Nobel Prize for math.

If you're going to make a post to convince people you know what you're talking about, spelling the primary word the post is about correctly in the graph might be a good start.

Almost like neither inflation nor deflation are inherently good or bad things and are context dependent, and that this post is an oversimplification?

It's too odd to be accidental though, so I'm assuming it's a reference to something?

What's with the wrapping job on the ad here? And why "Higwai"?

Is there supposed to be a link here? It's currently just a picture.

Reddit hasn't reported to Condé Nast since 2011, and has been independently operated since 2012.

This graph has:
* A flawed premise
* Poor visualization
* A seemingly random subset of countries
However, it fits a narrative that resonates with some people, and so it will do alright.

Reddit should totally take his money and then add him as the bottom mod, and then allow the rest of the mod team to proceed as they see fit with the tools that they have available.

Yeah I'm a bit curious about the concept of using a low-quality image macro as a medium for serious political speech.

Which, compounded daily over a non-leap year, works out to 137641% annual inflation. Just a tad higher than 2%.

Different things here:
* commented that 2%/day was steep
* rebutted that the fed supported 2%/year, so it wasn't that steep
* clarified that meant per day and the fed meant per year
* I expanded on clarification by putting the daily and annual figures on the same scale.

It's possible and I might even say likely that traders have trained models on the last rise/crash to maximize the advantage they can take out of this one.

Except if they ever wanted to do anything with their payments (pay employees, buy supplies), they'd need to sell them for dollars, which can be traced.  Until you have an ecosystem in which bitcoin can be used for everything, as a practical matter any amount sold can be traced.

Anyone into generalizations has lesser cognitive reasoning skills.
