Answer is still the same, go learn about private keys. Read the white paper. It's intro level stuff and nobody should have to google it for you. "What's wrong with it" **is** the reason bitcoin exists.
If you don't understand why bitcoin exists you need to back up and learn about it before jumping into debates.

Actually going long on seashells is a [brilliant idea]( Ocean is acidifying and seashells are mostly calcium carbonate, also known as [Tums]( dissolves in acid.
And to whom are you going to sell your seashells when the sea shore rises?
Notice that desertification in places like California right now? Their only hope is capping and green house growing, or cities are just going to vertically farm themselves. Aquaponic and hydroponic tech has grown enormously in the last decade and generally takes less than a tenth of the water with some systems being nearly closes and others recovering from the local environment.
What does this have to do with seashells?
Maintaining the right acidity in an aquaponics system is a huge pain in the ass and requires constant attention. Unless you drop some seashells in your beds. When acidity get's too high they dissolve faster, when the water get's too base the stop, like freaking magic.
Though I really shouldn't give billionaires ideas like this, but I live in Hawaii so I'm surrounded by seashells. Getting paid enough to pick them up would mean I could just "work" on the beach all day.

Your post couldn't be more wrong.
When you buy bitcoins you are deferring current spending power for future spending power. Anyone can cash out when you place your order using your investment. It works the opposite of the way you think it does. Same with banks, who hypothetically reinvest but make such poor decisions they end up doing worse than nothing to the economy in the process of making themselves wealthy.
Think of buying bitcoin as buying an ETF in the entire bitcoin economy. Then you will be on the right track.

That's a funny way of saying partners.
I want Coinbase and BitPay to do what they are doing. It's a feedback loop. I invested early, my coins go up in value, using merchant services I use those profits to expand bitcoins usefulness by spending. Eventually this leads to even more adoption and the loop continues. It's called "investing" you might have heard of it, it's where you spend money to make money.
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:21:20
Here is the super simple way.
Make a [paper wallet]( Make extra, extra sure you use a clean OS ([here is one that tends to work well out of the box]( And that you are **offline**. You can save bitaddress.org and run it from a usb stick.
Now put that in your safe. Congratulations you are now an early adopter, hedged until you figure the rest of it out.
"Change addresses" are something you are going to need to learn to spend the money off your paper wallets.
As long as you don't invest more than you can afford to lose you will be fine.
Also this sub is like the Star Wars Catina, you will never find a more retched hive of scum and villainy. Don't trust **anything** you read, verify for yourself.
One last thing, there are [those that have read the white paper]( and there are those that haven't. You don't want to be the latter, and while it looks intimidating, it's quite a fun adventure figuring it all out for yourself. It also makes you bullshit proof, and at this phase where our enemies are going from laughing at us to fighting us you are going to need that skill. This isn't going to be a peaceful revolution even if there is little *overt* violence.

A check is a contract between you and the guy cutting you the check. You took it in good faith that it was redeemable for the face value, consideration was exchanged, name on the line, that's a contract you have now in your hands. So when you go to the bank you are not asking for cash, you are demanding it based on a contract purchased in good faith that it would be redeemable for "legal tender", the bank is in *debt* to **you**. What the bank is doing is bald-faced [tortious interference]( Even a first year law student should see it, it's really basic 101 shit. But because only poor people can't cash checks freely, and poor people can't afford lawyers, it's probably the most common crime in the nation and nobody cares, just like you didn't until it happened to you.

You are missing the point. Bitcoins grey/black markets will still be more efficient than the incumbents, those people don't give a fuck what the police think, much less the regulators. In jurisdictions that don't fight bitcoin their markets will be more efficient than those that don't giving them a competitive advantage, further draining value from fiat. Globalization will only magnify these effects. Bitcoin is also zero sum, the more we win the more they lose, small mistakes from the central authorities can easily tumble out of control. You must also consider the authorities we are talking about are all unabashed opportunists, and like rats will be the first to leave the sinking ship.
The regulators are only digging their own graves, we got this shit one way or another. It's only a question of how painful it's going to be.

The features are legion, there are dozens of articles weekly talking about how bitcoin is differentiated right here on Reminds me of the old saying of you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink (it's actually way more frustrating than you think it would be, fucking horses are horrible people). The only way you can be this confused is if you are starting from the conclusion and seeing what you want to see. Bitcoins are a scam therefor none of this can be true.
Sorry but the FAQ and Myths sections are just a starting point, there is a long road of learning you haven't taken and it's obvious otherwise you would have counters for the common arguments instead of just repeating them.
For example


This isn't even a problem. I wouldn't call it a problem that your car can't make me a coffee. Why would you expect anyone to price things in bitcoin? That's just dumb, and yes a few bitcoiners were naive enough to try but quickly learned their lesson that it's best to leave those sorts of things to work themselves out organically, no intervention necessary. So it's not only not a problem it's also a functioning solution in case of necessity. Always good to have a plan B.

No I don't, it's never been proven one way or the other, and what was good once can become bad and vise versa based on the situation and the needs of the time. Maybe there are drawbacks to deflation, but having no previous examples to draw from we just don't know if it applies to Bitcoin. What we do know is bitcoin has many positive aspects, so many that even if it's not a panacea it will make things far more efficient, and by existing we give he market choice instead the say so of rich white guys.
Bitcoin isn't going to be your one thing no matter how much you want it to, it's a complex system created that way because it must to grow and continue existing. You can not like the economics and keep fallaciously appealing to authority (the same authorities that have steered the exiting economy like it was the Titanic) but that isn't going to convince anyone that matters. Don't like it don't buy bitcoins, but the issue is far from shut, it's never even been tried before in a modern economy so quit pretending you are an oracle.

Most of the loans were over exuberant federal loans to the poor from online diploma mills. They basically sold them like cash back on car loans, it was skeezy. It spilled over into the rest of the system due to the over supply of easy money (credit). That led to an expansion of "administration" to unmaintainable levels. The bean counters and petty dictators are never going to give up their jobs so teachers and students always take the hit. Prices go up, quality goes down. That's always what happens when demand exceeds supply.
It's barely even slowing down though because an entire generations indoctrination of the importance of higher education. That flies in the face of the reality of needing to be able to survive in an environment of extreme wealth disparity.
It's not only an economic land mine, we aren't even remotely prepared skill wise to deal with it. Sure some people still know how to do shit by hand, but when millions go hungry only bullets or a ticket out can really help you.
That's why bitcoin is so important, it can fill the power vacuum, allow trade to continue, increase the value of the internet itself increasing the odds that it will be valued and preserved in a free state.

These assholes aren't making all that much, they get paid to sit on ass and troll, that's not expensive. They know most of all that they are wrong but a payday is a payday. I expect quite a few are themselves investing for the day they can claim with yet another identity that they had faith all along. Mark my words in a Bitcoin world you won't be able to find the worst ex-haters from early adopters. Rats are always the first to jump ship.
Driving down the cost with FUD means they can buy more and more BTC. It's one instance where bitcoin's greed based incentives bites it in the ass, at least temporarily.

A degree in economics is really a degree in the Keynesian implementation, not economics itself at an abstract level. Like the difference between a degree in video game programing and a degree in computer science. Calling the classes "economics" is disingenuous at best. This happens because the vast majority of economists in the US either work for the fed directly or indirectly, as in 80%+ including your teacher if they are applying for any kind of grants at all.
They are directly invested in Keynesian economics, it's not about science it's about money. Once you own some bitcoin though it's an entirely different situation you are hedged either way so you don't have to shill or lose your life savings or your education investment.

And you add stability to the price. Stability leads to adoption, that leads to more stability, that leads to rising prices.
You can either try to guess the market and possibly make lots of money (though most are better at loosing) or you can get less direct benefit but increase the total value of the system, with the least risk one can be exposed to when using Bitcoin.

No fees is unsustainable, those banks aren't operating at zero cost, eventually there is a hidden fee you *are* paying even if it's just inflation.

How I change the world is being an iconoclast, and that's not mutually exclusive with being idealistic or pragmatic.

If someone with Down's syndrome can not just handle me telling them "don't be a dumb ass", but actually appreciate that I know they are better than that, someone without a crippling disease shouldn't be offended.
I expect more from people, rise to your fucking ability, it's not optional, quit being lazy. I know it's hard, I'm ADD too and lazy as fuck on top of it but some things just have to be done.
If that means bitcoin doesn't grow in their direction, good, that's the way it should be, stupid should hurt.
I try to live by the golden rule and that's what I want to happen to me when I do retarded shit. That way I **stop doing it**. Like when you touch a hot thing and burn yourself.
I'm not angry, just disgusted in the race to the bottom. SpaceX recently announced they are only 12 to 14 years away from the Mars Colonial Transport. I'm going all in on Bitcoin despite the risk because it's the only possible way I can ever choose not to live on this planet any more. I'm making the high risk high reward decision, I want the price to rocket up, but it's better this way.

None of this means diddly squat unless you are a trader though, traders shouldn't be "investing" in shit they don't fully research in the fist place.

You aren't thinking like an developer, engineer, entrepreneur, activist, or even a savvy tech user. The wheel was once useless and didn't solve problems until uses were found and then it immediately became indispensable. The old systems cannot follow where bitcoin is going (and has [already gone]( Just because bitcoin had to start at literally zero and has't fully caught up yet, doesn't mean it isn't going to, and by design extend even further. Opportunity exists primarily in these environments, you have to have imagination but that's where the money/development/fun toys are.
This isn't about just replicating existing solutions this about solving things in entirely novel ways and seeing what works and what doesn't, scientifically, for the purpose of creating new modes of socioeconomic interaction, that once adopted completely supplant the previous paradigm. Bitcoin is the tool to create the new machines not the machines themselves. Those machines are being developed at a blistering pace, it's almost unreal how far things have already come with such a small user base, do not underestimate the talent attracted by Bitcoin, our developers are second to none (well maybe Linux kernel devs).


To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”


That's what we are doing, that's what we are here for, even if we have to find a thousand ways [how not to make a light bulb]( eventually we will find a way to make one that burns for a [hundred years]( (adjusted for the [law of accelerating returns]( of course).
That is a big source of friction in the community, we get sick of people calling us failures when we are still working on it, and it's volunteer work.

We have moved into the next phase. Several of the last drops were because of (needed) hardware infrastructure upgrades, this one is us buying the closed loop. It may even go much further down in the short term and I'm perfectly OK with that, that's how I want the money I invested (this is a zero sum game) spent. Once the loop closes all the shit throwing FUD monkeys are going to have a lot less ammunition. This is exactly how anti-fragile systems should behave.

Short positions on bitcoin has nearly dried up. All it takes is one upward spike to cause a chain reaction of short positions forcibly closing as their losses exceed what they can cover. 
So right now bitcoin is potentially primed (depends just how much credit was actually available) for a massive upward swing.

Yes it does, it's very very simple. You buy a bitcoin on the market, the price rises making everyone's bitcoins a little more valuable. Someone buys something, cashes out, whatever doesn't matter, they get to use that slight price rise when they spend. That's your money they are spending you just "invested" it in whatever they decided to spend their money on. Their success will be your success, their failure your failure, everyone depends on everyone. Bitcoin value never just goes away magically, and if you think so cite your reason instead of just saying so.
Bitcoin was built this way on purpose if you followed the mailing lists and early development. It's not an accident.

Everyone is trying to drag down anyone and everyone they can reach, it's pervasive and often necessary for survival. Ask any Walmart employee who has been stiffed overtime yet opposes unions for fear of loosing what little they still have, to Politicions who's Super PAC support is essential making real reform impossible, and anyone in between, it's pervasive.
We are all guilty and innocent to some degree, the best thing we can do is to find ways to keep us from behaving this way that are ethical. I think Bitcoin will some day prove to be a powerful force to that end. It's just a gut feeling, nothing really backing it up, but I like to think positive when it's reasonable. It's good to have goals to guide you. Figuring out how to implement the Bitcoin experiment ethically is a good goal, it leads to optimal efficiency and that's best for everyone.
This thing is just getting started. Look what the Linux kernel did to the operating system environment. That's the effects of OSS, now apply those same factors to the development of cryptocurrencies. While I'm not saying it's going to end up perfect, It's has to end up a heck of a lot better than we have now.

Lets just assume the worst, that bitcoiners are so evil they wont part with their money unless you take it their way. So fucking what?! Sign up with bitpay or something and take those assholes money and go fight Ebola! Even if it only brings in enough donations to cover one interns afternoon of setting it up it would be worth it.
This seems far more about people getting upset that the dollar isn't being used than anything else. If I wanted to donate a Ferrari to DWB nobody would be getting butthurt, they would just sell the useless car and pocket the cash. Same thing.
You can say that bitcoin users should do the conversion for them, maybe some can't (the unbanked), maybe some are just lazy, maybe for some it is a big deal even though it's not rational; the point is it's actually DWB who's job it is to administrate, that includes accepting donations, no matter what form they take (within reason, and you have to be crazy to say bitcoin is unreasonable).
I'm sick of seeing this sick tactic of being offended for other people. If DWB want's to tell bitcoiners to keep their money let them say it. What you are doing only alienates people and hurts the cause.
The OP never said withhold money, yet the top comment is one looking a gift horse in the mouth, accusatory, and flat out wrong about DWB not having time, **now** is the time, not once shit blows over and everyone forgets or stops caring. *That's what the office staff is for*, they aren't *all* doctors.
Because I don't see how this is a problem that can't be solved in a few hours on the phone with bitpay; anyone and I mean **anyone** that says DWB should turn down perfectly good money because *reasons*, better be able to prove it first. You make the claim, burden of proof is on you that this is a "bad idea". Because all I see are a bunch of weak excuses being used to convince people to not even try, and that's just sick.

If you bitcoin you own a computer, if you own a computer you should be using it anyway to manage your finances, if you are using a computer to already manage your exiting finances then it's just a matter of plugging in the special rules for Bitcoin into your software. The special rules are pretty much just a FIFO problem.
Again I expect this software to exist soon, if not then I will pay a developer to extend [GNUCash]( myself once I can afford it.
I don't want to hear about problems that can be easily solved if only people want it bad enough, those aren't "issues" it's just work, nothing needs to be invented only done. If there is a market then it will get done.
That's why this is a bunch of unnecessary worry.
Edit: A quick google search confirms my theory, there is already a lot of chatter about Bitcoin integration into GNUCash, people are already [forking]( back ports are just a matter of time.

Having been here a while newbies just don't have any idea what bitcoiners have been defending themselves from. After the hundredth time you see "bitcoin is going to fail because you can just copy them" being upvoted, it's not just frustrating it's factually untrue it's damaging to people trying to make informed decisions.
That's created a hostile environment. There are games going on here, is a massive target and many conspirators are acting at cross purposes, some good, some bad, some just ugly (like the SA Goons).

Bitcoin is the monetization of decentralized systems, that's what "solves the Byzantine generals problem" means.
I think what you mean is it's difficult (impossible?) to corrupt it.

You should. With a few million prudent key taps almost anyone can be rendered obsolete, as the tough guys are finding out. We targeted the biggest gangsters of all with bitcoin, the banksters. It's no surprise other violent criminals are feeling the hurt as well.

As they abandon the dollar for BTC their debt stays in dollars. The dollar inflates, maybe even crashes, making paying back these generations of loans taken out in their names before they were even born easy peasy.

Make no mistake Bitcoin is at **war**.
Many nations have made tied their currency to their sovereignty, so any attack on their currency is also an attack on their sovereignty.
Go ahead and make fun of me for saying this but, *it's actually a good thing*. Because unlike states technology is based on reality. If a technology can't survive in the real world it isn't fit for purpose. If Bitcoin can't survive regulations (either through capturing those regulations itself, operating within the word of the law while disrupting the spirit, or flat out rejection and possibly violence), then it doesn't deserve to continue existing. It necessarily **needs** to make room for the next solution. This is the heart of "fail early fail often" start up culture.
It's a little ironic that Nietzsche's quote:


is one of the most misunderstood and misused quotes out there and perfectly applies to Bitcoin.
Nietzsche was speaking of states but his insight actually applies to all complex systems. Bitcoin **needs** a predator, something trying to kill it. It's what applies the evolutionary pressures to make it better. The harder they try, the faster solutions are created, the faster the technology matures.
So thank you bad actors, without you we couldn't have accomplished so much so quickly. You are all still a bunch of cunts and we hate you, but only as indiviuals, as a group you are necessary and useful.
TL;DR: It's actually a good thing.

Bitcoins are an idea that can function as money, they aren't a "thing" they don't have mass, they aren't your car, your house, your wallet or any other *thing* you can think of.


That's a bullshit lie and you know it. This is why nobody give a fuck if your kid wanders off and gets lost anymore. Assholes like you that make it dangerous to even get peripherally involved, and will twist shit unrecognizable to support your narrative despite obvious facts. You are the evil that projects like bitcoin will eventually obsolete. No wonder you find them so threatening, you can't argue with math.


The "code" was the private key, the specific piece of information designating ownership, it's entire purpose, was also literally converted to electrons and transmitted world wide instantly.

Luckily the bitcoin space is brain draining anyone with half an interest and real tangible talent. Haters by and large don't have the chops to steer the boat they can only complain about destination chosen by those that can. How do you honestly see that working out? Antagonizing those who very well may end up the "great and the good" of the next cycle. People that go out of their way to make things happen, they aren't called developers for no reason. Do you really think that's a good idea?
Those kinds of people, those people are the grace you live by, and they are taking back control (something I recognize despite being a harsh critic of Ayn Rand, what a preachy bitch). Call me crazy but I would step lightly, economics at this level is a game of thrones, the gauntlet has been thrown, we are past that now, it really is serious business even if it's wrapped in fun and games. And no matter how insignificant bitcoin may seem today, it was previously much more so and survived, despite even greater skepticism and greater ignorace.
We live in interesting times, make no mistake picking sides in this fight has potential for very real consequences for both sides. Most likely it's a zero sum game.
For me, haters just inspire me to continue using my capital gains to reinvest in the bitcoin space, **making the future** where haters are not just wrong but painfully so. I want them financially and therefor socially impotent so we can go back to being a noble species of explorers and achievers, instead of slaves to liars and thieves.

It's not hard to understand. You are lazy, I was lazy, I got burned in much the same way. Now I'm not lazy and use cold storage and paper wallets.


Have you even tried? would be a good place to start. Then there is the bitcoin talk forums, the coinbase blog, and so on and so forth. I have personally written tens of thousands of words about bitcoin for anyone willing to read them. If you can't find news you just aren't looking or you have very poor critical thinking skills.
If you are the kind of person that never DIYs then bitcoin isn't for you (yet). This is the "risk" everyone keeps talking about when we explain why early adopters deserve their profits. Most of us early adopters have lost money same way you did (or lost keys, crashed hard drives, online wallets, MS Windows and all it's virus laden issues). I'm even glad it happened to me, because I was able to warn others, promote alternatives, and create work arounds, without shitting all over bitcoin and it's community. Andreas Antonopoulos put it best in this [blog post](
The biggest thing is it's still very early adopter time, you can always learn your lessons, learn how to make a paper wallet (it's not that hard once you give up on the excuses) and by this time next year you could be laughing about all this.

So you are going to cut off your nose to spite your face because of a few vocal idiots? Bitcoin is supranational, you can add your voice and change the community or form your own, or not participate at all but then you get no say.
It seems to me your biggest problem is your need to assign a group to be responsible for bitcoin, like team Bitcoin, and now you are standing against this "team Bitcoin". Except team Bitcoin doesn't exist, so you are only tilting at windmills.

I had a gut feeling about the housing crises when I was working as a landscaper. McMansions just weren't going up any more.
Now I work in recycling and even that is getting super competitive and often just not worth doing. That was suppose to be recession proof but the funding is drying up / being diverted. We are going to have an infrastructure crisis soon. Like a food web failing.
Add to that the trillion owed by the next generation that's impossible to ever pay back working at McDonald's with their worthless diplomas (that due to over supply are now mandatory further driving up the cost). That's another massive bubble waiting to burst.
Bitcoin will become the only place to flee soon. Those loans for their degrees are immune from bankruptcy, but they are denominated in dollars. When inflation is the only way out for an entire generation that's a dangerous thing waiting to happen.
By adopting bitcoin and allowing the dollar to fail it would shift the balance of wealth accumulation from the old to the young. From the stubborn to those willing to learn new things. That's a status quo that's more in line with a meritocracy.
Once and come around it's going to get messy.

If it's any number at all I would be worried. Those things power square with the number of qubits, so one day it can't be done, and the next someone adds a couple of more bits and it can be done easily. It's way more complicated than that, but quantum computers scale very very quickly.
I do think D-Wave's quantum annealing machines will kill Bitcoin eventually, not because of breaking encryption, but enabling general AI by accelerating deep learning algorithms. Hack a D-Wave machine to a Watson box and some crazy things might happen including waking up some emergent intelligence that obsoletes money itself.

You can't even read a FAQ what makes you the expert on the protocol? Got an itch go contribute or stop bitching. Hate the put up or shut up culture all you want Linux gets a lot of emotional heat as well but that's how shit gets done. What you are doing is the opposite of that.

Absolutely not, everyone should have access to investing in bitcoin. I would suggest a paper wallet in your case. A bootable copy of Linux and a printer are all you need, then just sit on them until you are comfortable with the technology, or applications are written that are idiot proof.
What amount you decice to invest is entirely up to you, but you shouldn't feel excluded just because it's complicated, monetary support at this stage is investing as the price helps drive development. If bitcoin is successful you will be rewarded proportionally to your stake.

Because early adopters aren't going to be looking for stupid places to store their wealth when, for them at least (we are talking about the people that drank the Kool-Aid early) it is already is the safest possible place. That should lead to a massive price drop on many traditional stores of wealth (again we are assuming a fundamentally Bitcoin based economy), houses, education, gold, will all return to their pre-easy money values, making it not only possible but easy to save and build wealth, leading to ownership without debt.

Past performance is no indication of bla bla bla, yada yada, doesn't everyone know this already?
It's like those "just a theory" people when you talk about evolution, well yeah no shit, it's a theory I know what that means better than you do.
I have a hypothesis for why the market pattern has been repeating itself but I want to want to wait and observe a while longer before opening it up to peer review. That's why I only pointed out what has happened before and that the situations are similar (all rodeos are similar, that's what the colloquialism refers to) to the last few breakouts, though not identical.

Dumb move followed by smart move, you sir are a good learner, humble, and inquisitive. A little more experience and you may go very far in this world.
If you are looking to actually work with bitcoins I suggest buying a few, learning some Linux (you can dual boot), figure out paper wallets, cold wallets, get an android figure out wallets for those, sell a few things if you can for BTC then head out with your knew knowledge and consult for small businesses in your area. By the time you get a handle on it assuming you learn as fast as you did here the market will be perfect.
Good luck. =)

Empires fall, all of them that's precedent.


Who are good at playing their game, that's why the drastic rule changes. If you think following the old methods are going to be as effective under this new paradigm you are actually worse off than those who admit they know nothing at all. This was on purpose, we want our enemies to underestimate us, and over estimate themselves.


Everyone but a select few are ignorant that's the problem, there isn't any transparency. Ignorance except for the oligarchs is the status quo. At least within the bitcoin economy we are all *equally* ignorant, a significant improvement.


At this point in history I would say that fiat is equally as risky, no currency has ever withstood the test of time, and newer models tend to replace old ones. You are ignoring the risk of doing nothing during a potential paradigm change, that even if unlikely would have drastic consequences for those caught unprepared. Bitcoin as a hedge isn't just risk, it's risk management. Considering the buy in price is so low due to it's development cycle, easily lost money for even the poorest investor (like me who was saved from homelessness and catapulted from destitute to working poor with just $20).

I noticed how so many people were willing to "suggest" that the early adopters should be donating to the Mt. Gox "victims" and getting angry when we instead decided after over a year of warning these people that it was largely their own fault. I just don't see how coddling people helps and apparently neither does most of the early adopters. We aren't a "participation trophies" culture here, we are a meritocracy, that means there is going to be some tough love. When you fuck up big we are going to point it out so the *next guy* doesn't suffer as well (for example why the hell are people using BTC-E?!?).
On the other hand the early adopters jumped at the opportunity to help out a guy just caught in the crossfire of an irresponsible journalist.
The one attribute shared by many of the early adopters is valuing personal responsibility, it's what attracted us to bitcoin in the first place.
If it's your fuck up, then you live with it. If there is something we can do as a community for those just down on their luck bitcoin has been one of the most generous communities I have ever been a part of.
When I compare the *actions* of this community to the words of it's critics, they aren't even similar.

It's a great idea for ten years from now.
Memristor architecture is basically a hardware neural network. It's programmable like a FPGA, but without the speed hit so it's more like a programmable ASIC, logic and storage are unified, it's non-volatile.
Basically when it's not doing anything else you could have whatever device join your "cloud" of computation capacity and do whatever is most economical for you while you live your life. Taking a nap in the park? Your phone you left beside you in the sun using it's photovoltaic covering decides to mine some bitcoins since it's battery is full already and it has nothing better to do. While surfing the internet and stumbling on an article, your laptop in accordance with the EULA of the site mines for them for some predetermined number of hashes in lieu of a small charge, ect, so on and so forth.
It also means that cloud providers would be mining monsters if we don't keep them busy, as long as they could access cheap/free energy.
Ultimately when Bitcoin rules the world (it's a hypothetical) it's the supply of cheap energy that will give Bitcoin it's ultimate value. Luckily sustainable energies are becoming preferable to the waste digging deeper and deeper for worse and worse fossil fuels.

It's not a "big leap", you are [begging the question]( now. In reality it's pretty damn obvious, it's cheap, it's effective, anyone with a reason to keep bitcoin down (throw a rock) has very few reasons not do it. It's a freaking no brainer. You are asking us to assume central banks and those that profit off the status quo, people with deep pockets, **all** believe that bitcoin isn't a threat, and **all** of them wouldn't do the *cheapest easiest thing* to counter that perceived threat. That's not to mention other parties that are trying to keep the price down including less than moral buyers that are trying to sweap up cheap coins by manipulating the market. "It's a pretty big leap" is a pretty fucking tall tale.

It's both, and there is nothing wrong with that. Some people accept more risk than others. But you would have to be a fool not to buy $20 worth today unless it would literally mean going hungry.
The other side of the coin, a question people should very much be asking, is how much can you afford to ignore cryptocurrencies? Doing nothing is taking a risk also, the status quo never remains that way forever.
Remember this is also a potential zero sum game where Bitcoin or some other crypto replaces fiat. Transitioning from one crypto to another is far easier than going from fiat to crypto. If the unthinkable (to some) does happen then even a small hedge would pay off huge. If not, if cryptocurrencies turn out to be fundamentally flawed then you are out a couple of meals at McDonald's. That's one hell of an insurance policy.

Just because Amazon is big doesn't mean they have to make Bitcoin a big part of Amazon.

I have a few questions and issues regarding the TOS (yes I read those things).


This is the standard arbitration clause pioneered by AT&amp;T for screwing their customers. I can see how it reduces costs but instantly puts me on the defensive. When the Supreme court decided yes people can sign away their rights, we have to be extra careful not to. It's not exactly ethical for me to tell people to use a service they can't sue over if they do end up getting screwed.
How I would mitigate that is running a very open operation, prove you have all the bitcoins to cover all the tips, full reserve that anyone can verify would go a long way to mitigating this legal loopholes threat. Do you know if there are any plans or progress towards doing this?


lots of potential for abuse here as well. What does changetip consider obscene for example? Is in trouble? Should they worry about losing support? While it's not for everyone the old tip bot was a game changer for sex workers, it allowed them to get paid directly out of the shadows where so much harm actually comes from. Should sex workers expect a step backwards due to this, what guarantee do they have that migrating isn't going to be harmful to them?


We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the Changetip.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
Nothing is perfect and I agree that changes will always be needed, but it would also be nice to have a customer Bill of Rights so to speak. If I am paying for the privilege of using and expanding your service what protections do *I have* as a stake holder?

The incandescent light bulb makes light. The sun makes light. The sun goes down at night and it's dark. Therefor light bulbs don't work at night.
That the current state of BTC criticisms. I would love it if these critics could actually find useful bugs but they don't. It's the developers and users that are finding the bugs and paying (directly or indirectly) for their solutions.
Most BTC critics have no interest in progress or making BTC better, they just want to watch shit burn, so they never really learn enough to contribute at all, not even as devils advocates.
Just look at how "it's actually a good thing" has become a demeaning meme. Finding the silver lining and learning from your mistakes is now worthy of mocking criticism. These are the critics true colors shining through, much whaling and gnashing of teeth, no useful content.

That's exactly how it works, most people lurk on forums, for every comment there are hundreds of invisible eyes.


Doesn't pass the first gate, it happens all the time.


What story? isn't one homogenous thing, some people realize their mistakes and others want bailouts and to point fingers.
Both exist, it's the later that tend to collect the "rude" responses, though you obviously are trying to paint a different picture.


Here is my perspective if you are loosing your life savings your parents are to blame for not teaching you the most basic investing rule, **never invest more than you can afford to lose**.
That's where I draw the idiot line, if you do that you are an idiot, period. There is nothing the world can do to help these people, the only solution needs to come from themselves.
You are the one that needs perspective, it's not job to potty train you, it's not the duty of a currency to eliminate all risk for you, it's not the early adopters job to bail you out. Doubling down on this entitlement bullshit is just making things worse.
Nobody made anyone gamble their savings away, and despite all the lies to the contrary it's the single most common thing repeated here not to do. We shouldn't have to tell you not to stick your hand in a blender, just like we shouldn't have to warn you about risking your well being on BTC, but we did, often and are still catching shit for it.


There has never been a lack of people calling me stupid for ***everything*** I have ever done with bitcoin good or bad. The world has been nothing but antagonistic to us early adopters, there seems to be a never ending list of entitlements I'm expected to pay for, even though I didn't see anyone demanding these things actually put in any work to [earn them](


Because they had the personal responsibility that any reasonable adult should have.
**Don't invest more than you can afford to lose!**
How many times do I have to repeat myself until it gets through to you? There are *no excuses* for anyone in their right mind not to know this. The only reason anyone ignores this advice is pride and greed. I don't pity the prideful or greedy, just as I don't expect pity in return. This is also known as treating people like adults, actions have consequences and if you try to blame anyone but yourself you are going to get shit for it.


No good deed goes unpunished is something I am very familiar with. Call me a dick all you want I'll let my actions speak louder than my words. I would rather a hundred people have hurt feelings than one person lose their house, something you don't seem to actually care about even though you bring it up over and over again, like it's normal to just gamble away your life savings, and everyone should just feel sorry for you.

I can prove you wrong now because it already is something other than a "easy market manipulation tool", but you would never *understand* the explanation.
You have never seen an asset like Bitcoin, you don't even begin to understand how an API can hyper monetize, or why these rare units of account are so valuable. Here is a hint, it has less to do with simple rarity, and more to do with the many other things Bitcoin is [capable of](
Bitcoin has features of an API, a database, currency, stock, ETFs, all rolled into one, and that's just right now. Soon you can add smart contracts to that list, and many other features as it develops.
You also have to be familiar with Kurzweil's [law of accelerating returns]( [Metcalfe's law]( the [Byzantine generals problem]( it wouldn't hurt to have a little game theory knowledge thrown in), and the ability to read and [grok]( the [white paper](

It has nothing to do with the price directly, every major bank owns an astroturfing firm or works very closely with them. The only goal for those astroturfing firms is to make communities suck. From Occupy to bitcoin, to global warming, their most effective weapon is to keep people on the defensive and sow paranoia. It gives their masters time to maneuver creating FUD so they can define the "debate".
That's why some of us old timers don't bother much here anymore. You are either in camp "salesman" or camp "trolls" just what the astroturfers wanted.

Honestly I don't think this situation is actually fixable by anyone. We need AI, we need an adult to smack us small minded children down for our own good. It's actually the the reason I invest in bitcoin that I talk the least about, but crypto currencies are perfect for the artificially intelligent.

Gwynne Shotwell recently announced Mars is only 12 to 15 years away. And that's no some photo-op mission that's the MCT (Mars Colonial Transport), we are sending the Mayflower, they intend to stay.

But once you get to Mars you only have one third the gravity. It's not just easier to lift off from Mars, [it's practically child's play](

These asshats only want to make sure any investment or financial activity of any importance what so ever must go through a rent seeker. They want to use regulation to make trading in BTC just painful enough that most people avoid it while the powers that be get to make their plays first.
This is why bitcoin was created in the first place, to put these assholes in their place. First they ignored us, then they sent the shills and trolls to laugh at us, now we fight.

This is why I am doing what I am doing, recognition/blame is nothing to actual progress, I just want things to be better so we don't have to argue any longer. There is so much we as a species could accomplish once we remove corruption. 
Personally I just want things to limp along just a couple more decades until we have [cheap access to space]( giving us unlimited energy, rare earth elements, terraforming tech (that we are going to need as we continue to fuck up the planet) , sustainable habitats (this means the ability to live with a negative carbon footprint), access to zero G research environments.
There are also other technologies like 3D printing, aquaponics, automated drone based transportation (from small packages delevered by quad copter to trains, planes, and automobiles), androids/humanoid robotics, mesh networks, life extension, etc, are all in heavy development right now.
If bitcoin goes big, I will have capital to make significant investments in all these technologies, even if the body politic doesn't have the will to fix the world.
Maybe the world will love me for it, maybe it will hate me, but none of that matters because I will have created the future for us all and I will get to enjoy some of that. That's something that just doesn't happen often enough in our greed based world to keep it going much longer.
Bitcoin isn't the end it's just the next necessary step in creating post scarcity.

The entire point is to kill bitcoin without looking like that's what they are trying to do so. The media has elevated pure denial into "skepticism" therefor moving the burden of proof onto the wrong parties. History is full of conspiracy, and between our technology and extreme wealth inequality it's easier than ever. Yet cries of "crazy conspiracy theorists" has caused our society to more and more turn a blind eye to corruption. It's fucked up situation where if an "authority" claims even a modicum of denial, plausible or not, it's blindly accepted. So why not? They are so harsh because they can be and there isn't anything they think you can do about it.
Don't believe me? Just sub to and see how many times the word "procedure" (aka the Nazi defense of just following orders) is blindly used to justify truly abhorrent crimes.


Because fuck them, that's why. Everyone in NY that want's BTC just got a massive warning to buy while the buying is easy, get in before the hurdles go up.
Some shill is probably going to mock me with the "it's actually a good thing" talking point, but those idiots haven't read enough Nietzsche.


He was talking about nations, but it applies to almost any complex system and us bitcoiners aren't afraid of a fight. We want to be challenged, we want our tools to be tested, we want to know with out doubt that we have in fact constructed an anti-fragile system. It's not enough to just use those words then try to hide behind secrets and privacy. All hypothesis must be tested to become theories. Cowards can't understand that, to them any opposition must be "bad", they have no idea what the war is about much less how and why the battles play out the way they do.
Bitcoin will be tested again, and this won't be the last of their efforts, personally I welcome it. If Bitcoin can't survive I would prefer not to waste more effort on it, instead we will fork or patch as needed to create the next tool to fight the same fight starting all over again if needed.

It's long past time we dealt with that. I know MS Windows is familiar but it's a development plague. Without proper security many if not all forward motion from this point will be stalled. We need a popular Linux based secure platform before we get to enjoy such things as the internet of things anyway.

Actually it's nice for everyone and here is why. When the banks file on you got compromised they called it "identity theft". Of course it was their files, their security model, and they were the only party capable of doing anything about it so they charged their customers instead of securing their systems. They made it your problem instead even though there was literally nothing you could do about it.
People didn't like that for obvious reasons but the banks still couldn't admit they were being robbed, no it was "identities" that were being stolen even though your "identity" isn't the dictionary definition it's just a file of specific personal information. So the charge back became popular. This means instead of you getting fucked by the bank because the bank fucked themselves with poor security now merchants are double fucked because they are out merchandise and the money. So prices must increase for everyone, the guy paying cash covers the cost of the guy paying with plastic, while the guy paying with plastic is covering the cost of criminals.
With Bitcoin you can have the convenience of plastic without the insecurity of the bank in the middle. It's just you and the merchant. As long as you trust your merchant or it's inconsequential amounts it's perfectly safe.
Larger riskier purchases could use multi-signature escrow at a small fee that is not passed on to customers that don't need it, creating competition and keeping the price down.
And if shit really hits the fan that is what courts are for. If a merchant is stealing we shouldn't just be looking out for ourselves anyway but once you get your charge back you stop caring because it's not your problem. Bitcoin forces us to do the right thing and confront the problem head on and solve it in court where thieves belong. This will remove thieving merchants from the market allowing honest ones to thrive.
Eventually and it will take some time, but we will be left with a much more even and fair market, we can actually trust more because we are forced again to have vigilance, as it should be.

Anyone should be able to see the weaknesses in TCP/IP, the primary one being it does nothing to handle peering. The protocol basically ignores that sending data costs money.
When the internet was small it was easy to work around and the costs were small enough that nobody really cared all that much. Now that it's world spanning TCP/IP is really starting to show it's age.
A new protocol that supports mesh networking natively is what we really need moving forward. Hardware is cheap, storage is cheap, let the end points take some network load and everything will be much nicer.

In fact my bank account got compromised and if it wasn't for bitcoins I would have been totally fucked because I couldn't put minutes on my phone and I needed to call work and family letting them know I was alive but stuck during a serious storm. It was bitcoins that saved the day with snapcard. Fiat not only failed spectacularly when I needed it the most, bitcoin was the *only* way to get my phone working again. And all it cost me was a few pennies from a couple years ago.

It actually simplifies the problem immensely.
If you need 100 tons of titanium on Titan you just query the universal material index and get a readout of how much can be delivered when and at what cost. It's a commodity market and delivery system all in one. Instead of trading bitcoin you are trading tons of ore to be delivered into X orbit at X time. Projects can both be planned around potential delivery windows as well as deliveries diverted to more profitable markets in reaction to changing realities auto-magically.
It's a massive simplification compared to having a bureaucratic organization running things.
If you think this isn't necessary then you don't understand the complexities of serving a capitalistic market constrained by orbital mechanics. 
Imagine Kerbal Space Program with half a million missions all running concurrently. Half of which are automated drone mining expeditions. Due to the realities of space being freaking vast, most of these missions are just stabs in the dark and we won't really know what's available until we start doing close range search patterns. So the market will be flooded with random strikes of opportunity. And the pace of things will be occurring over multiple generations requiring long term stable management.

I'm a developer I **make** things happen, I'm trying to share a perspective here. None, zero, zilch, nada single "investment" would ever pay off without people like me, the actual do'er. For us money is just a means to an end. For investors it's the opposite. That's fine but there is nothing wrong with being the developer. If you have any BTC holdings at all you want me out there putting it all on the line, getting shit done, instead of just speculating.
Don't worry I have a plan for those BTC. Because the system is open, it can be learned starting from the white paper then extrapolating. I don't have a plan for $$$, because the system is opaque and corrupt. So I will stick with what I know, I just happen to know a few things you don't. Just like your mechanic probably knows a few things about your car that you don't. While you see gamble, I see challenge. You see throwing dice, I see arm wresting.
While your education doesn't prepare you to take control of such situations, mine does. That's cool, I'm sure if we were talking about any other economic subject you would probably school me.

Poor OS security has been mostly caused by poor security investment. An open source SOC hardware doing 2FA internally using a secured OS running in a VM (also running on the same OSS SOC) is definitely achievable. When people start caring about real security it will create the market for real security and we will solve these problems.
I could be wrong but we recently thought distributed trustless systems were a harder problem than the trusting trust issue.
A stripped down Linux kernel and no user space fluff makes the problem a LOT easier, and that could run parallel to your shitty ad-ware infested OS no problem. Open source the security hardware and software down to the compiler and traces and we wouldn't have to trust trust.

WTF? Why is that untenable? That you have to pay taxes on income?! Yeah everyone does that already. And if you hold for a year unless your income is over 40k, there aren't any capital gains at all. That's a hell of a lot better deal than what the IRS takes out of my paycheck. It's (mostly) just a FIFO problem (with some tricks to even further reduce your tax burden, that software could quickly search though), this nay-saying is ridiculous, software can very much just do it for you. And at the end of the day everyone using Bitcoin ends up with more than those that don't (assuming growth, otherwise you don't pay gains).
You would have to be pretty retarded to pass up that deal just because of a little math, especially considering everyone has a computer in their pocket these days anyway.

The meme is different from the statement.
People don't try to find the silver lining because they want to say "This is actually good news!" and are looking to fit a reason, they say that because it's a statement of fact, after figuring out a possible solution. You can tell when they are sincere because they always follow with a reason why. Now they could be wrong but it's a contribution none the less.
"This is actually good news!" the ***meme*** on the other hand is just people looking to be critical just to shut down the conversation.
They post "This is actually good news!" before anyone even has a chance to analyze what can be learned just to shit on the people with real ideas and solutions. It's fucking disgusting.

It's easy to tip when the thing you are tipping is essentially valueless. Bitcoin tipping was just as friendly and meme-tastic (bitcoin users not affected, lol something something circle jerk) when it was practically worthless as well.
Dogecoin started to follow the same pattern of people getting serious as soon as it was worth something. Yeah I noticed all the serious "too the moon" posts getting upvoted there as well. Unlike Bitcoin though Dogecoin never had an infrastructure to support it's price and when it crashed it went back to "having fun" after months and months of antagonizing bitoiners that you were going to teach us something we didn't know already.
Different strokes for different folks is cool and all but Dogecoin hasn't pioneered anything and should have far more respect for the shoulders of the giants you stand upon.

You can invest in ways other than money.
We are all heavily invested in TCP/IP for example. Bitcoin is the first open money API, so some of us invested in it for the same reasons we invested in email back in the day, the numbers add up. Or they at least add up enough to make an educated guess as to the potential of the technology. Hard work makes up the rest, and being invested there are that many more reasons to keep working hard to make it work.
It's not all about the money, thinking in only money terms isn't going to help you understand bitcoin, or why those working on it do what they do.
I'm watching the software not the markets, the markets aren't rational anyway. The software, that's happening at an amazing pace. Having been involved in Linux from Slack 1.0 days, the pace and quality is astounding. Not perfect, hell not even good, but astounding that's it's gone so far so fast.

You are like those idiots that think someone is stealing your bandwidth when you leave your AP wide open. When a computer you control gives someone something of yours, you have given it away even if you didn't explicitly hit the button, it's acting in your stead based on how you programed it.
Same thing with private key ownership. It's a special property that only belongs to you if it's secret. Letting loose that secret is the same as making the property it protects public.
You would prefer nice human property laws where everyone must admit you are some sort of special little snowflake. That's not how bitcoin works it's math with it's own uncompromising rules, either you deal with that reality or you are going to have a bad time.

Not a bad idea, even a kludge solution would be profitable, basically a running quickbooks implementation. Modifying GnuCash shouldn't be that difficult, I'll get around to it when it gets itchy enough, or bitcoins deflate enough for me to worry about then pay someone else to do it. Maybe one of those MIT kids would probably like to take a stab at it, anything pays better than internships these days.
And remember we are still talking about paying taxes on money they wouldn't even have in the first place if they weren't investing in Bitcoins. This is extra money from poor peoples point of view that you are bitching about, you could just estimate then safely overpay and not worry about the math and still be ahead of the fiat only guy. All your bitching about is that it's not perfect, it remains superior because we are assuming the value of Bitcion is rising here. If the value isn't rising or it's falling then you don't owe squat in taxes, so it's a moot point.

To some of us leaving a legacy instead of a smoking crater, still matters. You can't just dismiss altruistic motivations because you don't personally believe in them.


I think you are just trying to be a victim by taking everything I say an injecting your own context. I didn't come here to attack you, but I have no patience with people putting words in my mouth. My post was simplistic for simple understanding, not to be extrapolated like some sort of manifesto. Everything you think you read into my post is just a reflection of you.


See there is your problem, you can't understand why basic infrastructure is an investment, it's all short term charts and prices with you. The definition of the word "invest" isn't limited to chasing direct profits, like you seem to assume. A farmer invests in his farm just as much as the bank that loaned him the money to buy it does.

That's another way of saying it's not enough to be dollar rich, this fight is for the monetary system itself, zero sum. That's how rich some of the early adopters are looking to be.
Considering the world has already created the mega rich like Bill Gates, and the Koch family, I think it's hypocritical for anyone to hate them for trying, unless you are already a socialist or similar.

Hawaii's government is a special kind of fucked up.
People think that it's illegal occupation doesn't cause major legal problems like this, but it do. Our state government is pretty much twisted into a Gordian knot over it, leading to these situations cropping up constantly. There is no clear legal way to do anything here, they mostly just make shit up as they go along.
Zuckerberg just learned this lesson when he thought he could cut off the last of the beach access becasue everyone else had (also illegally but unenforced).
The Hawaii legal system is a cluster fuck of Kingdom and US laws that do not play nice together and I have no idea what way this will swing, as crypto currency is gaining strength in independence groups and anything they do the state sees as "bad".
I seriously doubt this will get fixed any time soon without a major lawsuit.

Nothing wrong with choice though, if the demand is there why not?
Coinstar could even partner with coinbase or bitpay and only have to deal with software (mostly UI) side and let someone else deal with the bitcoins for a modest fee.
Those things have to be easily extensible otherwise they couldn't deal with the ever changing PayPal and gift card requirements.
Just like investing in bitcoin it's high risk but low barrier to entry. It's a "why not?" investment. Even if bitcoins lose you get experience in the crypto-currency market, necessary experience as we enter the new century, with nearly no risk exposure. 
The up side could be astronomical on the other hand, especially with first mover advantage.
Either way a win-win scenario, with a minimal (and eventually necessary anyway) capital investment.

You can sue. Hell the reason fraud is so bad these days is precicely because nothing is ever done about the fraud. The relitively wealthy just reverse charges and the poor (who can't defend themselves) or the unobservant (who don't defend themselves) are left to be victims. Chargebacks aren't how you deal with fraud, jail is how you deal with fraud.

The loser here is the merchants most often, and it's the cc system that allows those merchants to be victimized. Bitcoin is just lubricating that processes. Only the cc companies and the banks can fix this fundamental security issue but they aren't incentivized as fraud doesn't cost them directly but doing something about it does.
As a holder of bitcoin, this is good for me. I'm not going to participate but the sooner merchants turn on the cc companies the better. And it's not like the banks have been unaware that pull is insecure... for decades. This "blood" is on their hands as far as I'm concerned, and they charge money for that shit. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

Ugg, so many don't really understand the point of being a VC.
It's about "buying the future" though "blowing money". The only reason that VC's even try to make a profit is completely tangential. When you are a VC you are using money to buy the future you envision. Then you make sure the bulk of your normal investments are poised to take advantage of the companies technology you directly invested in because even if it fails financially the technology lives on and moves the market regardless. You don't have to win to win.

...ergo just the increase of users using the transmission end of the network can more than proportionally increase the value. Even with near zero time spent in bitcoin, and even thought the purchaser doesn't value the price, it's the act of buying and selling itself that increase or decreases the price.
Considering markets aren't rational, not only do I agree but would also say it should be noted that's not including many other factors that contribute to making bitcoin attractive ([like this](

Not necessarily, just like copyright doesn't mean all works under it are prevented from being distributed. Heck without copyright we wouldn't have the GPL, copyright is what gives it the teeth to protect itself while serving many of the same needs as a the public domain, basically public domain double plus.
Anarcho-capitalists could create court systems that have fairness and altruism (altruism as it would be used in evolutionary game theory not the hippy dippy kind) had coded in.
Now would they? It's hard to imagine them taking the leap considering the culture and my theories on how such a system would consider the concept of property, but you never know. Lots of anarcho-capitalists are early Bitcoin adopters even though it's also great for statist/liberal/[hippies](

You need to R(ead) T(he) F(ucking) M(anual).
Old geeks and hackers don't say to RTFM to be mean (for fucks sake who do you think writes the manuals?!), it's just the beginning of the journey no matter how much you want to take short cuts.
**If you choose to not RTFM** (it's right there in the side bar, back in my day we only had the freaking white paper to rely on) then you are going to get ridiculed for doing it wrong. The only people excused are those doing development and writing the documents for the first time paying those costs for you ingrates that can't even bother to read the TLDR of the experience in the form of best practices and FAQs.
I'm sorry that you prefer to be treated like a fragile child but that's not my problem and I don't care if that makes those people think bitcoin is a bully (like how that means anything). Bitcoin is for the real world, not the fantasy playground people imagine the world to be.
People who champion this sensitivity only cause more ignorance. Either learn the subject or pay someone you can sue to do if for you **or you are being foolish**. This is an idea even Forrest Gump understands.

Women came to bitcoin before even the anarcho-capitalists. I don't know what planet you are from but I much preferred it back then when everything was sex positive and not a bunch of whining. There was a few months the easiest thing to buy with bitcoin was dildos.
It's an emerging system, if women want in, the solution is to get involved not bitch that some man isn't unconsciously doing enough for you. I got my own damn problems. I do not have the time to prove to you or anyone else that it's true that you can't make a horse drink no matter where you lead them, both literally and figuratively.
These narratives serve no purpose and accomplish nothing but creating arguments and victim mentality.
99% of the time I'm right there with you, stop oppressing people, but you **also** have to know when it's **your moment**, stop bitching and grab on to opportunity. That's a personal responsibility everyone has and nobody can do it for you.
If there aren't enough women in bitcoin maybe it's the women doing something wrong, they use to outnumber the guys (sex work went down to paying pennies due to market saturation, it was almost purely a gift economy). If you aren't even willing to consider that's the problem then you will never find a solution if it is.
Bitcoin was even featured on The Good Wife in 2011! It's seems to me maybe it's that women don't care and aren't listening (something my GF constantly complains about when **she** tries to get other women into bitcoin). Go bitch at them because I am out of fucks to give, I'm not alone, and more bitching without clear goals and policy suggesting is worse than doing nothing at all.

Take them to court.
The chargeback system has been a huge umbrella for criminals to hide under for too long. It has created the situation where if you got money and get screwed you don't care, but if you don't have capital to protect yourself you can't afford to bring a case. So nothing ever get's done about it. Bad merchants just target the poor while the rich don't give a damn.
Money shouldn't be trying to fix everything, sometimes you have to leave the house and enter the meat world and deal with bad actors directly. Cargebacks are just a way to kick the can of responsibility down the road (on the poor and merchants).
It's also a huge reason "[identity theft]( is such a huge issue. If the banks and businesses were responsible directly for security they would invest in better security. As long as someone can be blamed without record it's never going to improve.

As a long term follower and user of cryptocurrencies I totally expected this to happen, and honestly don't give a crap. I'm not going to use those services but I don't blame those that do. It's nobodies fault other than the private network operators that fraud is a cost of doing business.
This is what inevitably happens when banks and businesses define the standard (pull instead of push, storing identity information with every merchant, etc) and it's insufficient. If the systems the banks have created weren't so damn easy to scam this wouldn't happen. Since the banks [don't have any incentive to improve]( they don't.
I've been a contributor to better security and open source for over twenty years now. I watched white hat hackers get thrown in prison for publishing what the criminals already were abusing. Banks were warned long ago to adopt strong security, most of the hard work was done for them they just needed to adopt it. This is the bed the banks made, now they sleep in it.
This is how disruption is suppose to work. It's ugly, it's cruel, it a force of nature. But above all it's **necessary** because disruption illuminates problems you **already had** just didn't realize it. If things weren't already broken disruptive technology can't succeed.

That would be developing proof of X technologies, the exact sort of thing a "Bitcoin Foundation" should be doing.
It took me a while to realize it but you basically have the business plan for the real "Bitcoin Foundation". Nonprofit doesn't mean no profit, hell they could even be structured as a public company with "investors" buying color coin stock options and shit. People would **pay** for that.
Eventually I see all these "how to pay the core devs" posts and ideas converging into a distributed DAC. Any new Bitcoin foundation that exits between now and then should entirely focus on making it happen as fast as possible. That's providing value.

You must be from the Walmart generation where you get what they give you. There was a time when businesses would bend over backwards to make a sale, even the owner would talk to you, though it was the same guy running the counter. When I lived next to a general store it might as well been Amazon.com, if I could point at it in a catalog he could get it for me in two days or less.
If businesses were rational, they would be bending over backwards to sell Bitcoin to their customers, not bitching about having to learn something or change.

If merchants all pitched in a few pennies a year on an open source solution decades ago, point of sale would be a solved problem. By trying to compete instead (trying to buy an advantage outside their core competency) they all screwed themselves, and now bitch about how hard and expensive change is.

Nobody claimed it was an actual contract. It's just what people call it.

So yeah, keep tearing down those strawmen.

Give me a discount or hold some back, either way if I can buy something knowing that some of the value will remain in bitcoin as a whole and not just be cashed out, I'm more likely to buy.

Nobody calls theories "laws" anymore not for decades now, so you are just agreeing with me. That was my point.
Saying the "social contract" isn't a contract, because you didn't sign it; is as to saying the "law of gravity" can be disobeyed, as long as you don't get caught.
"Social contract" is just a poorly thought out noun to describe a complex mash of animal instinct, societal pressures, mutual unspoken understanding and a whole host of other shit. If you think it's something you sign you're an idiot. If you say that shit out loud you sound like an idiot.
Just like if you were to think you could sue the government for falling down the stairs because the "law" of gravity made you do it.
It's just not clever.

As for the "issues" of ground stations, the plan is to use nanometer based software radios, meaning they can frequency hop, twist, and all the other fancy stuff they do to signals these days plus it's software defined directional. That means these sats theoretically can transmit to and from orbit directly to mobile devices. Combined with [project Loon]( and Google's fiber holdings, and mesh networking, Google will own everything from their own backbone to the last mile world wide.
As for frequency, it's going to be a nasty political fight just like net neutrality. The FCC has been stupidly irresponsible with the radio spectrum kowtowing almost entirely to bug business.

Basically a bunch of rich assholes bought up all the oil while it was still in the boats betting they could sell it for more. The Saudi's not being idiots and not liking the US noticed how far out on a ledge the market was and gave it a little push by dropping the price.
So traders and banks found themselves with oil tankers sitting out at sea full up but unloading them would cost them (they would have to realize their loss), so the oil was literally "too cheap" to sell into the US market.
This caused a drop in the fuel supply and a raise in costs at the pump.

I hear that.
Been working towards this moment for almost three decades (I wonder when bitcoin is going to be called the new-new-new-economy /chortle). Bitcoin isn't going to fix capitalism but at least we finally have a currency not based on trust (as humans generally can't be). Bitcoin is the first digital autonomous and distributed comptroller for the internet, that's a pretty big deal.
Bitcoin uses both people and code to automate and leverage wisdom of crowds without the traditional top down corporate structure. Bitcoin is in many ways an AI that uses our meat computers to make decisions, the same wisdom of crowds that makes reddit valuable just a different algorithm more fit for purpose.
While the internet sill has a long way to go information continues to "want to be free" despite irrationally aggressive and expensive attempts to revert that tendency though brute force, nearly all  have failed (torrents for example, though that's just the tip of a unfathomably large iceberg). Only OSS code is *capable* of being ahead in the security war, and now that it's glaringly obvious many underfunded over relied upon security libraries are finally getting the attention and funding they deserve. The internet is becoming reliable because it must.
Bitcoin is the first information that really does want to be (pseudo)private, and it was only achieved by setting certain other information free as a work around (by reversing SOP, push vs pull). Blockchains are the first "right way" we have discovered to create trustless systems (theoretically). We never had the ablility to do money right, we have been using kludges all along.
Fucking genius hack if you ask me, right up there with Richard Stallman using copyright to not only make a better public domain than public domain, but popularized the concept of law hacking. Using the legal system to circumvent it and/or improve it, despite the intended results of imposed rules implemented by the least altruistic of our race.
Though that is a testament to humanity, we actually did manage to fake until we made it (this far at least). It's also why I don't think bitcoin needs to be absolutely perfect to work, only better, but time will tell.
Every time a new communication technology is discovered freedom expands, backlogs of new ideas are shared, progress happens. Now it's happening all over again, another fundamental form of human communication (markets) is being delegated to the internet at large followed by a great burst of freedom. And developers, shit's hot right now, sooner than later these "dumb ass teens" will be real adults, with real experience, and real power. While a lot of anarcho-capitalists are jizzing their pants right now, I'm looking at a horizon far more interesting as the same process happens to Bitcoin itself. Just wait until Communism/Socialism color coin is a thing, implemented as a DAC, that's when things are going to get really interesting. And then after that, I can't even imagine, something something Star Trek I hope.
I think [Winston Churchill summarized]( best how I feel right now, at this moment of furious technological change, having been around for a good portion of the beginning (cut my teeth on Slack 1, use to BBS and MUD, 4 digit /. UID, "I would like to subscribe to your newsletter", goat.se, yada, yada, yada...) watching us come this far though every little baby step from the Commodore on up has been alienating due to so much FUD like "Y2K was entirely made up", "the GPL is unconstitutional", [the SCO group]( "Bitcoin is illegal" and so forth. But that's slowly changing (possible upcoming S curve?), as everything is becoming [cross corroborated](


Things are only going to get more [interesting]( from here on out. But I for one am very excited about humanities future despite the apparently [long odds](
TL;DR: Bitcoin is the Internet's IPO, but it's been such a long time coming it's hard to see what's really going on.

Once Backpage stopped accepting Paypal couldn't get enough bitcoin. It went from being like trying to get Bob from accounting to switch to Linux from Windows, to something casual like suggesting a new restaurant. "Easy" has replaced "confusing", and many of them have become interested in the politics as well, even if most just need $100 worth to post some adds.

I agree and want to do something about it.
My GF is a camgirl so we have content. The real bitch is the advertising and distribution. We want to pay other people we don't know to do that for us, somewhere between a multi-level marketing scheme and a simple referral link.
So my question is (having been out of the loop for a while other than reading how would you go about it? Where would you start?
We would be willing to explore a split as high as 50%, half for us, and the other half should be split proportional (weighted in favor of the most BTC spent by those they referred). Basically a smart contract attached to each grouping of content.
We were also thinking of a patronage model, like a mini kickstarter where the audience can fund the scenes and content they want first, or buy (DRM free, in my house we are pro-piracy, the only way to beat it is offer something better than free)
I don't know how dooable my ideas are, any help would be welcomed and possibly paid if we can get a decent income stream going.
I have a feeling if advertising porn becomes a legitimate bitcoin faucet it could turbo-charge advertising by combining organic word of mouth with fair and reasonable rewards and incentives (can't hide from the blockchain).

Kind of like what bitcoin is doing, price dropping but merchant adoption and innovations hanging from the blockchain are increasing significantly including major investments. Once you miss the ground you're in orbit and halfway to anywhere in the solar system. If the value has to drop to increase the delta-V so be it, I'll keep holding, spend that value now, keep increasing momentum. As an investor I like what I see, bring me that horizon. Then we will discuss exchanging those coins back for future value.

The only people who are going to find Bitcoin of much use in the near future are speculators and developers. With both groups you really only want the kind of people that are willing to dig the truth out of things on their own without the hand-holding of excessive presentation.
If you can't get over the MS Paint look of the advert you would probably just be in the way anyway at that point, bitcoin wasn't nearly ready for mass deployment, nor is it idiot proof yet. It's best that people who need shiny and simple stay away for now.
On the other hand it was catchy, and cute, and really stood out grabbing attention, all the things a good advert should do. It wasn't even shilling for anything in particular just pure branding. It stuck so well people are posting it's image for nostalgia points, giving it another free round of distribution.

The state for creating the environment due to the "war on drugs" and Ross for being an idiot and an asshat.
Getting 20 to life in prison for standard criminal on criminal behavior just seems wrong. That doesn't represent a threat to society, only to other thieving drug dealing criminal asshats. If anything Ross reduced crime overall.

Exactly, many of us just don't recognize the current system of law enforcement as just.
I still support Ross not because I even believe him, but due to the law and courts having gone bat shit crazy over the last few decades I certainly don't trust the state.
I'm not satisfied the court actually did it's job. Ross is still most likely guilty, but that's not the standard of reasonable doubt. I would rather a hundred men go free than set the precedent of lowering that standard.
I would have held to "not guilty" only because of the prosecutions theatrics. If the sate is more interested in winning through procedure, than maintaining it's integrity, then the social contract is broken anyway.
The state is damning itself, by being just as dishonest and weaselly as the criminals they are suppose to oppose.
Worst case if the state follows a just (or at the very least perceived to be just) procedure a guilty man goes free.
Worst case when the state plays fast and loose, loss of faith in the system leading to civil war.
Ross is too petty a criminal to risk undermining faith in the system, and just famous enough to trigger the Streisand Effect.

You should read about mobsters and their popularity during prohibition.


It's very simple, the violent crime is created by prosecuting victimless crimes. It creates the environment where violence is **necessary** to provide the good or service due to avoidance of the law making you vulnerable. If there is demand there will be a market, there isn't any fighting that. But the state could have chosen **not to make it worse** long before Ross came along.
It's hard to hate the player when the game's corrupt to begin with (especially when that person is relatively young and providing a popular product).

You do realize that a Martian colony is within reach in the next two decades. That's the entire reason SpaceX exists.
Blockchains are also a great way to abstract resource allocation for Mars's assumed to be mostly robotic work force. For example, as a future potential colonist I might want to buy shares in a DAC that generates O^2 prior to leaving so I had air to breath when I got there. Instead of having to plan everything out to the Nth detail simple market prices will dictate if there is enough air for me or not while simultaneously indicating to the DAC to expand or contract as necessary. Kind of like how mining works now, just in the physical world, on another planet (and beyond).

Though the courts are basically at war with this idea. Going so far as to [make it crime]( to [tell people their rights]( as jurors.
If Ross really did take out hits then he deserves to pay for his crimes. But if the courts ruin their reputation in the process of prosecution then it's even worse. The US civil war was triggered by a Supreme court decision, fancy prose did nothing to stop massive loss of life. Intellectual analysis took a back seat to muskets and rifles. I would prefer if that didn't happen again, by not going down that slippery slope. Putting procedure above reasons that citizens can understand is very very dangerous for the government, despite being good job security for lawyers.
This case had all the appearances of a kangaroo court, so much so [even the judge got sick of the prosecutions endless objections]( but was powerless to do anything about it.
Instead of closure this case is now an open festering wound for the citizens it's suppose to serve. If it's not worth doing right, it's not worth doing at all. If the case was so strong, the prosecutor wouldn't have had to resort to cheap tricks is what a lot of people are going to take home at the end of the day. That's really bad for national security. Especially with the nation already on edge from so much other shit going wrong these days.

Understanding and accepting that it's right are two different things (and the reason jury nullification exists, it's not a crazy idea).
If you can't prove a victim even exists I really don't give a fuck what the state says, that's **reasonable doubt** right there. The state lies all the time as Edward Snowden has proven.
Do I think Ulbricht is a criminal, possibly even violent. Yes, absolutely, I wouldn't invite him to my house in a million years.
Do I think the state made its case in a legal and moral way? Not in the slightest, and I would rather 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison. Ross is one of those 100, because of the court, not himself.
Those are more than mere words to me.
If I was god dictator of the world he would probably get 10 years at least, but I'm not god, nor a dictator, nor is anyone else.

If you want HFT build your own market because there doesn't exist one that can handle that kind of load no matter what fancy talk you throw at it. This had zero to do with HFT and I would appreciate it if you would stop confusing the issue.

Nope. Chargebacks came into being as a consequence of "identity theft".
See back in the day banks were getting robbed because they had constructed this idea they get to determine your identity by using data they owned on their systems. When that data got compromised or holes were found in their system the last thing they were going to do was admit fault. So instead of calling it what it is, a digital bank heist do to their incompetence (not like their customers ever had a choice in how these systems were designed or implemented) they created the euphemism ["identity theft"]( and started sticking the bill to their customers.
This pissed people off. So they had to do something. Re-engineering their systems was out of the question, that cost money, instead the banks doubled down. It still wasn't their fault their systems are insecure, and they were losing business as their customers left, so they created the charge back, foisting the cost of their stupid decisions onto the backs of merchants who largely have no choice and nowhere to run to.
Though this just increased fraud by removing any financial incentive for banks to actually fix their broken security model and opening up more avenues of attack, all so they don't have to admit it was their fault for getting robbed in the first place.
It all just happened so slowly that nobody noticed it happening.

You seem very confused about the actual problems the world faces. We don't have production gaps, we produce epic amounts of stuff. Robotics and technological unemployment is orders of magnitude more influential in reducing the number of available jobs than inflationary spending pressure is adding them. Not only that but people can't be pressured into spending more than they have. Well after a couple hundred years of having their wealth stolen from them through inflation they don't have the means to buy anymore anyway. So we are quickly approaching the end game anyway.
The last desperate attempt to keep the debt bubble going was the wholesale debasement of the education paradigm. "Cheap" loans, sold to children, to pay for overly expensive educations they were told they must have. Now children and young adults hold the most debt of any group even credit cards, yet they are exempt from forgiveness.
Buy a Porsche, go broke, declare bankruptcy, get forgiven.
Children doing what their parents tell them, what their teachers tell them, what their guidance counselors tell them, what the media tells them, what their financial advisers tell them, what the government tells them, no forgiveness ever. Go fucking flip burgers while we garnish your minimum wages, that is until we replace you with a robot, then you can go die in a gutter.
It's no wonder Bitcoin is taking off like it is, it's not just technologically superior. There is a perfect storm of antiestablishmentarianism brewing, and Bitcoin is the most accessible and effective tool for reaching those ends.
Lots of young people are [coming around to the idea](that their parents and grand parents (baby boomers) sold them out long ago. The mistake they made was they sold out their kids for dollars and put the debt in dollars. So the path of least resistance lies outside dollars. Bitcoin is a zero sum game, as it's value increases fiat goes down. Eventually we can make our own jubilee, it will be easy to pay back those student loans in dollars when the dollars are worthless.
The entire system needs to come down, it's too broken to fix. Like trying to fly to the Mars using the geocentric model, with all it's weird rules to explain the strange planetary movements when viewed from the wrong perspective. Bitcoin is the heliocentric model, on the surface more complicated, but also more elegant and can actually be used to reach the heavens.

The internet itself has matured massively since then (I worked on MUDs back then). What you are seeing is similar to tech startups but happening at adoption rates that just weren't possible until today because the internet itself was still young.
The network friction is just so much lower today you can't determine timelines just looking at history, you have to account for the law of [accelerating returns]( and the [network effect]( in our new broadband/smart phone paradigm.
If it wasn't happening this fast I would be worried, but as far as I can tell there is nothing abnormal about the adoption rate or price except for the fact that nobody has seen it before. As technology accelerates these scenarios are only going to become more and more common.

You do have to trust the merchant, but at least they can only rip you off once if you use Bitcoins. I prefer this risk model over the credit card model any day. Compared to debit cards it's even better.
We shouldn't be relying on banks to enforce the law anyway. Take the company to small claims if they are in your jurisdiction.

I would be selling the origami not the bitcoin, the buyer would charge them up just before leaving them as a tip using a cell phone app or something (or even the reddit tip bot from their mobile device). They already take several minutes to fold and I want to offer them for less than a $1 as a lucky charm, something people could buy with their tip bot tips. If you wanted to leave them as a tip IRL you would top them up with an app on location.
That way people with very small amounts of bitcoins (like random people in other subs that get tipped) can go experience the purchasing experience if that's what they are curious about.

This is the correct answer, there are other factors pulling bitcoin up including nebulous "faith", but it's the utility that secures the bottom, and Bitcoin's utility both unique (relatively, the other crypto currencies are a rounding error compared to bitcoin's market), and novel (solving the trust problem), making it very, very valuable if you can see the potential. The price will continue to rise as infrastructure comes online.

This is what easy money [did to housing](
So people are already loosing their houses just to have to rent them back again even if they owned the house and the lender didn't. It's one of the biggest thefts in world history and yet a slap on the wrist fine and retroactive immunity for too big to fail banks was the only thing to come of it.
Your problem is you are assuming debt is actually working when it derailed decades ago.
It doesn't matter if bitcoin can't do easy credit, when credit stopped working for anyone not too big to fail anyway.
At least with Bitcoin doing it the hard way, saving, is still possible, a massive improvement from the *current reality*.

Been here a while so I will chime in. I actually agree with you. Not becasuse the world isn't ready for BTC, or speculators, or anything else market related. The reason the price tops out is largely lag. Every crash has experienced lag. In a car when the petal is to the metal you are going as fast as you can go. When a server on the other hand reaches it's maximum processing power instead of inching up to maximum performance it tends to fail spectacularly. One moment you are doing good at 98% and the next minute shit has hit the fan and grinds to a halt.
So it's technically not bitcoin that's over heated but the physical servers. When the information stop flowing the price can't go anywhere. As more servers are brought online, as software is scrubbed for bugs, and as new markets open up, bitcoin will begin to scale again to higher prices.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”
― Richard Buckminster Fuller
[Obsolescence]( is the single most powerful force in history, you can't see it, smell it, touch it, taste it, or hear it, but it can still hit you like on oncoming train and there is nothing you can do to stop it. You can smash yourself against it to slow it down for a time, or you can join in, but short of destroying the base of the technology that brought you to this point it will all happen again and again until obsolescence has won. That's why words like inevitable are thrown around without being hyperbole.

My point is machines doing work for people makes them obsolete, and since the industrial revolution what technology has taken has never been given back. Anyone who thinks they are safe isn't paying attention.
What do you do when all fast food is robotic? When all cars drive themselves and no taxi drivers, truck drivers, bus drivers, etc. are no longer needed all at once? What do you do when genetic algorithms and deep learning can design anything you can imagine better than a person could? What do you do when even management is ousted due to having no employees to manage?
There is nothing productive that tech can't do better than people given enough time and resources and tech is eating more of that every day.
You have to answer one important question to refute technological unemployment. What are the jobs that the average person can do that a machine can't do better, that would employ enough to keep the system running?
You say "hasn't happened yet", I'm saying hasn't happened to *you*, *yet*, but it will and sooner than you think, if history and the current course of technological advancement is any indication.

Don't be a lazy, try talking to your landlord. I have already been reading about people paying rent in bitcoin, it's happening but you have to **say something**. Oh an if you don't mind living in Canada you could buy [this house]( with bitcoin.


You are going to have to be more specific. Do you mean you can't pay your accumulated debts with bitcoin? Or do you pay your CC bill every month to avoid interest and are worried about loosing the convenience?
Since you say "credit cards" I'm assuming you are in debt, probably not an insignificant amount of debt. Bitcoin is going to change that. It's depreciating currency, it rewards saving, not borrowing. The good news is because it depreciates it bootstrapping is very easy. Its a paradigm shift, it's a feature not a bug. If you read about Austrian economics it's explained better than I ever could.


Don't be a lazy, try talking with your local farmer at a farmers market. I have already and several are interested in taking bitcoins they are just disappointed I don't eat more. Or you could just do [this]( if you can't be bothered.
If you expect everything to be done for you, don't buy bitcoins. The reason early adopters get the most benifit is we are doing the most work. Laying the groundwork, spreading the message, investing early, if that's not for you then you don't get the wealth that comes with it, nobody owes you a free lunch. Feel free to sit on the sidelines until you can do all those things. What's disingenuous is making a list of problems that are obviously in progress like a child complaining "are we there yet?". No we are not, we are not *there yet*, but what you can do is get out of the passenger seat and drive your own bitcoin car, then we will all be there sooner.
Or you can wait, nobody is forcing you to do anything, it's all up to you, the **power** is in your hands, you can take the steering wheel any time you want to. Can you say that about your credit cards?

Everyone trades time for BTC (aka has a job), at some point your investment in BTC is paying more than your time is worth, as long as you spend less than the value grows you will have perpetual wealth.
Now here is the amazing part about divisibility. It neuters many of the worst effects of hoarding. Instead of rich peoples wealth being locked up, hoarding BTC is actually just investing in the entire Bitcoin economy. Holding BTC is deferring the present value to others for future value, it's an investment.
Now we throw in automation, robots making robots. As soon as the economy is no longer defined by "jobs" and we can institute some real efficiency very few people are going to be needed to run the system. So it's a good thing that people can and will be able to retire very quickly by using Bitcoin. Everyone will only need to "pay their dues" so to speak for a brief period of their young life and will have all the rest of it to live and enjoy, essentially for free.
Human greed is not insatiable, most people are happy and content long before they are wealthy. Only the heavily sociopathic ruling class cares about the game where the only way to be happy is having more than anyone else. So for most people after paying their dues to get the economy on it's feet again life will become something like Star Trek, effectively free but not completely unlimited, but still pretty good way to live.
Maybe, this is just projection, it could happen, but so could many other things as well. Our collective decisions will determine if we end up living in a utopia or dystopia.

Sepeculators got burnt, that's why we call them speculators. But long term users and savers have seen this before and we will be fine. It's still up considerably from January. If everyone wasn't so panicky and didn't invest more than they could lose this bubble wouldn't have been half as big and the correction wouldn't have been half as large.
Having sympathy for pure speculators isn't on my list of things to care about. My advice to those that are holding long term is still the same, currency is partially valued on faith, if we all have a little everything will be fine.

That's one of the anti-fragility feedbacks. The spending economy is regulated across all users, like an inverse opposite tragedy of the commons. When the economy contracts it stimulates saving, and when excess value isn't being invested it stimulates spending.
This self optimizing regulation is amazing to me, once you think about it, you realize this is exactly how things should work. Bitcoin is socially engeneering us to be smarter with our money both on the macro and microeconomic levels.
It's really exciting when you extrapolate what that can mean for the greater economy in the coming decades. Maybe soon we will start to see reinvestment in infrastructure and exploration as people become more long term thinkers.

Everyone that really wanted out is out, when MtGox comes online though lots of money is going to be available to buy cheap coins.

I sometimes wish that I was one of the early explorers off on my own or with a group of like minded individuals setting out to discover something new with nothing but our mortal bodies holding us back.
Today we have places like subreddits were we can get some separation but the world and it's crab mentality keeps intruding. There is no new place to be to get away from the old thinking and start out fresh. Exploration needs to be celebrated again. Soon now the explorers that are the bitcoin early adopters will have enough capital that there will be nobody to say what we can and can't do. The social pressure to conform is about to made irrelevant. Our only limitations will be the physical world and our imaginations, with all other barriers to entry kicked to the curb for the lucky few with the passion for exportation and the will to do something about it.

Bitcoins are still in a very much DIY place. Remember when Linux was just released and under very heavy initial development? Asking for help got you a big fat **RTFM**, bitcoins are largely in the same place. People working with them have already answered these questions hundreds of times, they have provided documentation, and are getting a little fed up with the hand holding. It's natural though they have a lot on their plate, if the situation was reversed you would be acting the same way.
So like early Linux users do you get on board even though you might have to read some manuals and take some risks to gain the benefits of being a first adopter, or do you get offended at the over worked under appreciated developers and wait until it's been made user friendly? It's your choice, you have the power, don't blame anyone else for your decision though, if you decide your monetary future based on a little rudeness. Bitcoins are not a safe bet for the emotionally reactive, those are the people getting screwed during panics, so they might not be for you, at least not yet.

There is no blockchain for cash so Bitcoin is more traceable.

Here is how it goes down in [real life]( This happened in the US but it's more than common enough in every nation on earth. When authority comes knocking they act first and work out the details later.
Considering that bitcoins are the biggest poke in the eye to authority since the internet, and they are very poorly understood, you can't expect any sort of reasonable response until the matter has been settled the hard way, in courts, with much gnashing of teeth and oppression. Societal response always lags technology. In the case of bitcoins we are way out there on the fringe, nobody even cares about your rights because they don't realize you have them.
That's one of the reasons selling bitcoins locally is so dangerous, as far as the cops are concerned if you get robbed it was funny money anyway and not their problem.

Because I have bitcoins. I hold them long term so I only have to pay capital gains tax, that means I have several thousand percent gains historically. I consider spending bitcoins a reward for my good investment.
I also like the limited selection, when you filter out the print on demand stuff the rest is of very high quality for good prices. Have you seen [these shoes]( you can get from Iran? That's just not something you could just buy before Bitcoin, it's a totally new market. It's refreshing to see such quality and novelty even if it's of limited selection. Like Nintendo games.

My GF is a cam girl and we were thinking about this earlier. What would be cool is a 3D webcam and a Kinetic (or something like it) to create a 3D presence where as long as you didn't move around too much you could maintain the illusion that you were there. The Kinetic would provide a real time 3D model and the computer could paint around the edges a bit with saved data. Over the quality of a webcam link it probably wouldn't be noticeable. 3D TV/monitor users would have a static shot while Oculus viewers would have a more *immersive* experience.

I can't belive people don't see what the market is doing.
Bitcoin is near a nice round number 1000. Very early adopters tend to have nice round numbers of bitcoins. Very early adopters also have earned life changing amounts of money. And if you haven't notices x-mas is right around the corner and consumerism is pretty big here in the US.
So very early adopters are taking profits, upgrading their lifestyles, paying off debts, and generally rewarding themselves for the holidays. I expect the price to remain near 1000 until after the holidays.

How about for just a minute you try to think how **other people** might see things. Your problem seems to be **you** care only about money so you are projecting. We just had a Bitcoin Black Friday, the first real stepping stone in establishing a merchant community. Why? Maybe not everyone is a greedy asshole like you assume and spent some BTC, to reward themselves and merchants they would like to see continue supporting Bitcoin, maybe they just like the convenience of paying with BTC, maybe they don't have 50k in fiat, there are all sorts of reasons.
I'm not saying Bitcoin supporters don't care about the price but correlation is not causation. Once you understand that you will be able to answer your question for yourself. Or at least accept the truth when people explain it to you from the horses mouth, without resorting to making up insulting statistics.

@_date: 2013-10-21 17:08:16
One if the most interesting things about bitcoin is it's deflationary model. We are setting out to prove once an for all that saving is preferable to spending unless you have a compelling reason to spend. Buying cheap plastic crap from China isn't a basis for an economy, informed spending on quality goods that serve real needs is. Bitcoins provide the pressures necessary to encourage that behavior.
The powers that be, don't want anyone to know this little secret, they want to be the only ones who's money works for them and not against them. They will keep calling us names and pulling out their tomes of bull crap they call economic science to "prove" us bitcoiners wrong. While we just soak up more and more of economy from them as they hemorrhage into obsolescence.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:27:04
That's because BitPay just sold $100,000,000 worth of bitcoins*. Spending BTC does cause the price to drop in the short term, but it expands the network. Soon the loop will close when merchants and their suppliers all accept bitcoins the price will stabilize again. Bitcoin is paying for it's own infrastructure upgrades this way. Each "bubble" is really just the Bitcoin economy expanding again. That's why it's able to bubble higher and higher each iteration.
When you are playing the long game this is all a "good thing" you got to spend money to make money.
Edit: *Fixed stupid mistake, thanks Stanlot.

If it's any easier think of buying into bitcoins as buying into the entire bitcoin economy. If bitcoins were use to make something then a portion of that somethings value goes back into the bitcoin economy. So some day bitcoins will make everything and you can own a part of that.

No you cannot, even if I had to personally buy every bitcoin in existance at some fraction of a penny as a true believer I would do everything in my power to make sure they were distributed in a fair and healthy way even if it took years. I care more about the idea of bitcoins (or it's crypto successor)  than any amount of money.
Killing an idea is much harder than you can possibly imagine, killing one that is making you obsolete would require grinding to a halt all progress.
Let the bankers try, they will only delay the inevitable and make those passionate about creating a better world more wealthy and more powerful. I welcome that world where exploration and big dreams are financed with the same zeal as merely moving numbers in a ledger for the gains of the very few are today.

No I'm saying anything can happen in the short term there is no predicting specific $ movements in an international distributed technology.
The only thing we do know about bitcoin is in the white paper, it's fundamentals, that do happen to be very strong.
You obviously know little to nothing about software development in a production environment, the network effect, or many of the actual indicators of bitcoins potential. Instead you think historical prices are somehow meaningful despite having no basis to rest your argument on.  It's like you flipped a coin ten times and got heads eight times so you believe that if you continue flipping you will get heads 80% of the time. It's just bad logic.
So I predict (and most people that have been into bitcoin from the beginning, as I have) that in the long term bitcoin will go up or crash to zero (it's binary) based on it's fundamentals.
Anyone taking your advice seriously at this point deserves what they get.

You really do, because I wouldn't give you a dime and I feel a lot of the early adopters would feel the same. We didn't get into bitcoin because someone in authority told us it was a good idea, we read the white paper and figured that shit out for ourselves.
If you want money from the BTC community you are going to need to put up or shut up. Make it open source, make it free (pay what you want model), make it about something we all care about (like bitcoin) and you may have a chance.

Coming from being destitute here is what I did. Now you see I was almost homeless, just got a job, didn't even have work cloths and had to spend everything I had just to make it to my first paycheck. Even during all that I managed to get $25 worth of bitcoins. Slowly I have been dollar cost averaging my way further into bitcoin. Now my bitcoin stash is my savings, it's worth several months of living expenses.
Risky? Yes but remember I was destitute, I'm far better off now than I was.
I still needed lots (for me) of fiat for day to day expenses (high cost of living). But I managed to squeeze my pocket change into a separate wallet. Now that wallet is greater than my day to day costs I still keep a weeks cash around but if it's possible I spend the profit first from my walking around coins and buy more with fiat as needed. This way I won't run out of fiat if I need it but I'm still mostly all in on bitcoin considering I still have a ways to go until it's a life changing amount.

Good thing there is more to bitcoin than those things, a LOT more.


I'm no expert I just know to include the well known models in my theories. The government is always working against anything that disrupts it's accumulation of power. If the government (any of them including the pseudo-governmental powers of large corporations) will be able to do anything about it in the long run is the only relevant question. Considering what happened to the buggy whip makers, I'm very optimistic for the future of bitcoin.

China didn't decide to ban anything the idiot day trading newbies made that shit up (same people coming in here calling everyone circle jerkers) after reading a machine translation and "reading between the lines". Then MtGox had a hiccup that confirmed their doom and gloom because all they were doing was looking at charts, then panic.
Anyone not having a head in ass problem knows how Bitcoin shakes loose the weak hands every time and then honey badgers right along. None of the fundamentals have changed, China didn't ban bitcoin, there was a bug in MtGox trading engine and everyone is broke because of X-mas so money isn't flowing in quite as fast. Normal will return in January/February and everyone that got out now will be kicking themselves and having to buy in at a higher price. Happens every time.

I normally agree with you but in this case I have to take exception.
By spending BTC you are gaining the value of those that are deferring for future value.
Spending directly causes the price to drop, but indirectly expands the network causing it to rise again but the rise will be delayed until the new players start holding Bitcoin as well.
I'm still very bullish, this price drop is exactly what I wanted to get my stash back up after Bitcoin black friday.
Thanks bears. :)

Tens of thousands per bitcoin minimum in years, don't ask me how many years, some say ten some twenty some fifty, I'm guessing sooner than later knowing what I know about network effects but it's still just an educated guess.
That or zero as something better has replaced them as well as most other currencies.
There are trillions of dollars in the world economy, bitcoin is a world spanning currency (among other things but lets just focus on the currency part). That means the potential user base is massive. Also bitcoins are the first currency that makes micro transactions realistic creating it's own market. This means that bitcoins are just as useful to African goat herders (apparently they all have cell phones now or know someone that does) as the super wealthy. They are secure in ways that didn't even exist when fiat was invented. That's the future of bitcoin, that's why I am holding, buying, or spending but never selling.

Even if you could trust the bot and the guy running it 100% it could still have bugs. Sometimes payments don't go through, or when they do it's with a considerable delay. Even the tip bot's own documentation says to only leave it with small amounts you can afford to lose.

Most people didn't notice but charge backs became epidemic when identity theft became a thing.
It's funny that it was banks created the term, pushed it on the media and suddenly over night it wasn't the banks fault they got robbed by having an inherently insecure monetary system. So instead of calling it what it is, a digital bank robbery, they call it identity theft, implying it isn't their fault somehow, even though it's their system we are using.
For a while it was cool to just fuck the customer. But that created a public backlash, so the banks changed tactics. They pushed the bill onto the merchants.
Now with charge backs the banks can push the costs of running their scheme where money is tied to accounts that are attacked to "identities", a complicated mess of standards and "cost center" accounting for what security they do have. The only thing being protected is their own ass. They will happily brag about their databases security while selling the same database of costumer data to a third party sight unseen.
Every time you buy anything there is nothing to stop businesses from collecting more than enough data to steal your "identity". It doesn't take more than a few dirty actors to really fuck shit up in an unstable system like that.

@_date: 2013-03-10 02:52:00
For the last year I have been telling everyone about bitcoins. One problem I have been running into over and over is the “show me” mentality. To me this is totally reasonable, there are a lot of difficult to answer questions that would be better served by example. So if we want merchants and consumers to use bitcoins as currency we need examples of how to get from newbie to expert in the least painful/cheapest way possible.
This will be my first serious foray into the world of the entrepreneur and I can use all the help I can get. I will be logging and blogging this experiment as a model for future merchants, focusing on starting with as little capital as possible (I’m pretty broke) riding the wave of deflation to prove that bitcoins and the deflationary model isn’t just possible but even more competitive than existing currency transactions (cash, credit cards, paypal, etc).
So the first thing I need is a product. Lynday the creator of the popular Dragon Chow dice bags just got a new job and is getting out of the sewing business. She has open sourced her design, I have sewn a few and am now comfortable enough with the process to produce a quality product (though the beta attempts have some flaws). I will be adding value by offering free print on demand graphics on each bag ordered. This geeky  product seems like it would be a good platform for this experiment and it’s what I am capable of making and shipping right now.
Here are a few [I just created]( with what I had available (cotton canvas with a polyester inner)..
This is a printing service. To avoid copyright issues you send me the image(s) you want printed and we ship it to you. You can get anything at all printed as long as it’s legal (basically no child porn), so your bag can be 100% personalised, we don’t judge.
Here is where I need the communities help, all the details.
We are planning on using Coinlab.com as our online wallet, we will also be in contact with them concerning merchant services as the sitution evolves.
Purchasing supplies and materials. For now we will have to use Amazon gift cards to buy the supplies we need (fabric, chemicals to set the ink from printing, packaging, etc.), but we want to use bitcoin merchants exclusively. We will be offering existing bitcoin merchants first dibs, but also want to educate and pressure existing suppliers where needed. If you know of a good list of bitcoin merchants we could use that information. One thing we could use sooner than later is a good inkjet printer with a continuous feed system (need to sell a few bags first though, like I said above we are basically starting at zero), if you have one you would like to sell or know of a bitcoin accepting merchant we could buy one from we would love to hear from you.
Platforms to sell the bags, we are planning on putting our bags up on bitmit.net as well as offer them through We will also need hosting and a domain. Any information anyone has about these topics would be greatly appreciated. I know my way around HTML decently enough but don’t know much about the reputations of hosts that accept bitcoins so any insight would be very helpful. Anyone use wordpress? How did paying with bitcoins go?
Price. This is the hard one. This experiment is more about supporting bitcoins themselves than making a living though that would be really nice as well. We want to sell them as close to cost as we possibly can and make our money by leveraging the deflationary nature of bitcoins themselves. We will have open books, you heard that right, we will be telling the world all our secrets. Why? Because eventually we would like to get out of the sewing business using our model we work out here to bring bitcoins to our local economy. We also love the idea of paying it forward, and testing the waters, while keeping as much as possible inside the bitcoin ecosystem. Taxes and how to deal with them will also need to be worked out, we are located in the US so if you would like to lend your expertise, or at least get us pointed in the right direction your input would be welcome.
I’m sure there are many more nuances I’m missing, but this is a work in progress. While all the news about investors taking bitcoins seriously is great and all, it seems it’s past time we help out the little guys, the small business owners, the hobbyists, and the entrepreneurs, jump on the bandwagon. So if you are interested in such a project please post any ideas below, or order a custom bag (introductory price of $10 plus a flat rate $6 s&amp;h so save on shipping order a box full). Everyone is welcome to contribute, we want to know how to serve you best.
If anyone wants to buy one of our beta attempts they are functional, all we ask is you cover s&amp;h ($6 flat rate USPS) plus a tip if you are feeling generous.
Together we can forge a path for the real engine of economies, the collective power of the little guys.

Bitcoin is interesting in that it promotes both luck and skill. Sure some people are going to get lucky with bitcoin, they don't know how it works, never read the white paper, don't care about terms like "network effect", etc. We will always have that though, you can't eliminate luck entirely.
But there is also those that merit their new wealth, they read Satoshi's paper and can grok the inevitable consequences. These are the developers you see in bitcoin today. They are the visionaries that in any other market would most likely be wage slaving for someone else's benefit (due to barriers to entry, corruption, broken patent system, etc). New money is often the most productive money. The .com boom created the wealth necessary and put it in the hands a few visionaries and now they are doing incredible things, from Google's self driving cars to Elon Musk's VTOL rocket. Bitcoins are poised to multiply the number of elite developers with the means to make their dreams come true, and bitcoiners dream big.
There is luck in bitcoin to be sure, but there is also greater merit, the intellectual barriers (as opposed to artificial monopolies created through regulatory capture et al) to entry create that effect. Those gifted with the intelligence of foresight are attracted to technologies like bitcoin because they actually understand it, and we are about to make many of those people stinking rich.
It's easy to say it's all luck or all skill, but the truth is in the middle, and where in that middle really does matter. In bitcoin's case it really more meritorious how much more is debatable, but at least it's what you know mattering more than who you know.

It's good learning experience and the number one reason we tell people not to buy more than they can afford. Now that people (other than strong hands) are not going all in (due to getting burnt) the market is stabilizing a bit.
What's pretty cool is the market doing that before any major roll out of upgrades or fixes. Once the new high performance trading platforms are out we will be able to increase the value of BTC at least an order of magnitude and remain relatively stable. After that, who knows, but it's looking good.

Actually with Namecoin we could be seeing the first steps to a distributed DNS. This would be a fundamental shift from the way domains are handled currently. So yes the algorithms behind bitcoin may create a bigger more stable internet without censorship.
There has also been talk about using the same technology to create the worlds first distributed markets.

Bitcoins are more than your every day issue, they are political and a huge poke in the eye to the establishment. You are closer to war in Iraq territory than petty drugs territory. There will be a time when if you are a known bitcoiner doing anything with bitcoin will already be a check against you, add in a box of drugs and that's more than enough.
It might play out differently in court, but you are going to be subject to the process until it's all worked out. If bitcoiners are not prosecuted under anti-terrorism laws in the US, UK, and other war on terrorism nations for nothing more than petty crimes (or no crimes) I'll eat my hat.

The Chinese government hasn't really taken a position. This is just what they do when anything new hits their desk, they put the breaks on it until they know what they are working with.
Basically China is waiting for a bunch of old men to figure out a new tech, so they can move forward. Considering the amount of reverse engineering and progress China has seen in the last few decades, I wouldn't bet against bitcoin but it's going to take some time.

I'm as anarchist as they get within reason and I still pay taxes and expect you to do so also. I would love it if there was a way to support the infrastructure of a modern nation without using force, I really would, but that technology doesn't exist (yet). Bitcoins are more than an implementation of libertarianism, they are a new technology that allows a financial system to exist inside of anarchy. That's big, that's huge in fact, every previous try has failed because wanting something to be true really really bad doesn't work, you have to have more than that, you need a working technology.
Stop paying taxes now and you aren't a freedom lover you are just a mooch. If you would like to never pay taxes again invent something that makes it unnecessary first, like bitcoins make centralized banking unnecessary. Star Trek's matter replicator would do that, or even just spending your bitcoin wealth on robots for the people, get to work on that, then you can stop paying taxes without risking other peoples lives. Until then, yes I will support others holding a gun to your head if that means someone playing by the (necessary even if they suck) rules has proper access to the infrastructure that they need to live (ambulances, fresh clean water, bridges, etc).
Ultimately when you don't pay your taxes that's one less ambulance, that's one less person involved politically in making sure those dollars are spent wisely, that's just one more worthless mooch. I don't have sympathy for that guy. Be responsible, put the horse in front of the cart, pay your taxes while you discover a real solution to the problem, then you can quit paying along with the rest of us and be a hero, instead of putting the rest of us and bitcoins **at risk**.

Maybe you should think harder on why more and more people and organizations are accepting bitcoin every single day. We have passed the point where you can legitimately say bitcoin isn't accepted, it might take a couple of extra steps but it's not hard to use them.


Nope, I'm gambling on the fact that people are smart enough to recognize a better option when they see it or dumb enough to fail to stop those that are smart enough. Bitcoin's are not just another option that must be sold to the masses like cars, it's a new technology that behaves according to it's own set of rules.

I was destitute when I bought them cheap, almost homeless. Bitcoin now is all my wealth, quickly approaching life changing amounts.
It's a little ironic that I really can't cash out, I'm in that gulf between taking away assistance and actually being financially secure. The way society is set up it actually is the smart move to wait until my BTC is worth significant amounts before even touching it (other than some small purchases replaced with fiat immediately). Otherwise it's too easy to fall back into the trap of being poor and getting charged for it every where you turn.

That's the magic of bitcoin, if you have enough to make it worth worrying you can just go buy some ASICs. As opposed to having to give your fiat to some government fast talker and hope he doesn't do something so stupid it debases your currency.

It forces society to treat thieves like thieves instead of sweeping the problem under the rug. Chargebacks are a way for those with means to not be incumbered by theft, while those that can't defend themselves (the suckers, the elderly, the poor, anyone that can't afford the time to go to small claims ect.) get stuck getting screwed without recourse.
You don't solve theft with your money system, you solve it with courts and jail time.

Eventually it's going to hit us true believers and stop, if you don't want them I'll take them. Everything is in paper wallets right now put away, I would rather cut my own arm off than sell them because I value bitcoin the protocol. It's too cool to let die because of a few growing pains and bugs in the trading platforms.
The blockchain is fine, as long as that remains true I'll just keep on keeping on.
One lesson I have learned though is to spend more. From now on all spending will be done through bitcoin, that way I'll be mitigating any potential losses by owning stuff. Buy when going down, spend when going up, never sell, I'm done with fiat.

Now assume that not everyone has equal wealth, there will be haves and have not, some of the haves will have thousands even tens of thousands of bitcoins. Now assume not all 21 million will ever be in circulation. Now assume the population increases. Now assume tech like 3D printing, asteroid mining, orbital solar power, fusion, are a reality by 2140 and the economy is that much more valuable. If bitcoins become popular all those things will be adding to their value.
Large numbers are difficult to understand but if bitcoins even take 10% of the currency market they are going to be worth tens of thousands of dollars, if not millions each.

Creates a solution to a human problem that makes them do what it wants in exchange. Now we have CAPTCHA between us and what we want, the exact data needed by the computer to make reading a solvable problem. The thing is such an intelligence would be so alien we would have a very difficult time recognizing it even though we created it and influence it as it influences us. The ultimate court jester.

I don't see what you are seeing.
I see a flood of new people all butt hurt that we have replies for all their questions (for very liberal values of questions like "it's a ponzi scheme"). Instead of admitting that there might be some value to Bitcoin, haters are down to "quit having fun" as a reason Bitcoin is going to fail.
There are real problems with Bitcoin like the maximum number of transactions per second or Blockchain bloat. But it's telling how so very few Bitcoin critics are even capable of understanding the problems much less using them intelligently in their criticisms. Critics aren't even finding new things to criticize their only function, supporters are preemptively finding and fixing them before the haters have even figured out there was a real problem in the first place.
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a room full of people that can't see the boat in a magic eye poster. And instead of going through the effort of crossing their eyes and learning to look at something from a fresh perspective they instead voted that there isn't a boat and I'm dumb.

At 1% you are looking at a value of about $100k per bitcoin. If they get picked up by brick and mortar and secure 10% of the money market one million each. And that's not even taking into consideration the fact that the new money would be largely composed of visionaries, people that would put their money to work making their crazy dreams a reality like Elon Musk of SpaceX or the Google founders.
Now imagine tens of thousands of nerds newly wealthy pouring real wealth into the bitcoin economy, now we are talking about potentially billions per bitcoin. The next ten to twenty years are going to be a major shake up in the world power structure.
The potential of bitcoins is stratospheric. Not saying it's going to happen that way, but it could, and that's mind bogglingly amazing to me.

Bitcoins on the other hand are much easier to save. So instead of a spend then pay model we will have a save then spend model. I prefer the second anyway having lived my entire life that way. You shouldn't be required to play silly banking games to get ahead in this world, balancing debt with income and praying nothing goes wrong while trying to find the time to get actual work done in between. Bitcoins reward the producers not the paper pushers and I'm more than OK with that. Not everyone want's to play in the rat race.

I'm far from libertarian, practically a socialist with anarchist leanings when it's sensible (fuck helmet laws, but I still wear one, and I like paying taxes, though hate what they are spent on). And I don't think anything is wrong with bitcoins, regulation or no regulation wasn't the problem it was those with power attacking a young lion before he had could defend himself.


Regulatory capture jumped the shark a long time ago, I'm also holding BTC against a partial collapse scenario.
One thing I do know is it's far too early to call this game one way or the other. You may be right, but that only means we tweak the rules and try again. Eventually we will find a technological solution to corruption, BTC is just a first step. That's why I'm keeping in this game.

All these charts never take the most important thing into consideration. Bitcoin is a potentially disruptive technology, that means nobody really knows shit.
You either bet it is, and the best winning move is something like dollar cost averaging to smooth out the volatility.
Or you think it isn't and just keep on walking by.
Any other plans are not really based on knowable things, it's all just guessing, and given the size of the population some people will get lucky and think themselves the wisest in the land, until they lose their shirts do to the law of large numbers.

In theory it's not that hard. If they are capital gains then you only pay taxes on what you spend at 15%, because that's realized capital gain income. Why might be very complicated but in execution it's not so bad as long as you are not trying to do anything fancy.

When people call bitcoins "digital gold" it's an over simplification for the idiots, they aren't all that similar.
Gold isn't unique while every Satoshi is, gold is heavy while bitcoins are information, gold must be transported while bitcions can be transmitted, gold must be stored and guarded while bitcoins can be secured with a password, gold can be seized while bitcoins can be encrypted.
The volatility is based on speculation and emotional bullshit, it's the longer trends that are following rational market forces. People never buying into bitcoin because they only want whole numbers is the most ridiculous thing I have heard yet.

He is talking about Linux on the desktop. I cut my teeth on slack (then Gentoo, then LFS, before getting lazy and settling with Ubuntu, hows that for nerd cred?) and he is right in every way. Linux video drivers suck, Valve has already gotten significant speed improvements with their in house patches, so much so it significantly outperforms the Windows drivers.
They have a huge user base that just throws money at them. They are big into open source. And they are planning on launching their own hardware soon. Valve adopting bitcoin would be the biggest news yet, it would instantly legitimize them to the millions that think Valve can do no wrong. And those people are the kind of people that regularly piss away their disposable incomes, some times on games they will never even play.

Start your own trading platform the barriers to entry are as low as possible right now, the API is open, the only thing stopping you is local laws but you can always host your servers in Africa or something.


Nobody worries about double spends for tiny amounts, plus with green wallets it's already a solved problem, it's just going to take some time to peculate through the series of tubes.
Bitcoins are so new right now any problems you can identify are opportunities to take advantage of, no need to kowtow to the powers that be. Have a good idea, implement good idea, profit, it's all in your hands now, you have the power.

Good, BTC is still too new for idiots that fall for propaganda. Those people need their hands held but everyone with the capacity to understand the problems they face is too busy making something to spend time to help them. Like e-mail before hotmail.

Good points, and yes this thread has gotten confusing.
Simply put, if we are talking about the overall price of each bitcion it's based on it's technology potential and you don't have to worry about a crash (in the long run).
That doesn't mean we can't talk about it as a commodity, but it must be recognized that it's a subset of the bitcoin network.

Nah it's both inevitable and brilliant.
Bitcoin is one of those ideas so simple only a child can see it right off the bat.
We already don't teach kids anything useful about economics, hell we largely don't even bother teaching them how to balance a budget.
So you end up with a situation where the Bitcoin system of economics is simple enough for a child to understand while the central banking solution is convoluted and actually somewhat like a Ponzi scheme while Bitcoin provably isn't.
Kids also don't have any attachment to either system, they will chose the one that optimal to them regardless of tradition.
Being curious creatures by nature and with unparalleled access to unlimited information they are going to figure it out sooner or later. It's actually good to teach them to diversify, what the real risks are, how to budget, etc. than to leave them to their own devices.
If you think they should be educated otherwise feel free to do so. Schools love it when their local community takes an active hand.
I also upvoted you because this is a great topic, and your concern should be addressed.

OMG, what if Chinese who can't spend BTC at home end up importing US goods because our merchants can accept it. But our merchants end up using Chinese markets and financial services because their regulations don't impede development of that sector.

His drawbacks are really only potential drawbacks, nothing has been proven yet, bitcoins will be setting the record straight one way or the other. It's the reason you see so many calling it an experiment.
I'm very interested in what Google is going to find in the blockchain. They know how to crunch data like crazy, so soon we will be able to base economics on quantifiable data instead of making assumptions about complex systems of which significant portions exist behind closed doors.

No other exchanges can handle the volume when MtGox spills over. And apparently MtGox couldn't be bothered to upgrade their engine or servers until shit hit the fan. Even a simple modification like limits on automated trades was beyond their ability.
This is all most likely because of greed, instead of hiring qualified people while the going was good they preferred to see their own bank accounts expand.

Lending is dying anyway. Cheap credit causes too many boom and busts, while the booms might be good the busts have only gotten deeper and deeper.
Bitcoin makes saving instead of taking loans a much more accessible option. If you need more than that, like starting a business, crowd sourcing or a co-op model becomes the de facto method of entry into the market.
Bitcoin is a paradigm shift, old money logic is often a hindrance more than a benefit.
I expect to see a vastly more democratic and less top heavy society emerge out of Bitcoin, less consumers, less oligarchical corporate board rooms, less rent seekers. Bitcoin removes so many barriers to entry the need for loans is largely negated. At the same time Bitcoin puts producers directly in business with customers (different from consumers) it's globalization benefits given to everyone instead of just the few at the top.

I hated in the 90s when even the news started calling everyone consumers instead of citizens. I remember it clearly even though I was pretty young. Even in stories not related to the economy consumer is the preferred nomenclature, when describing citizens.
When I started buying my first bitcoins it gave me a really good feeling I just couldn't put my finger on. Today I know that feeling was. I managed to find a way to opt out of consumerism, I had taken back my citizenship from the bankers, I was free again.

That's exactly my point bitcoins are not first a currency, or a commodity they are software, as in a real-world process that increased productivity, same as Linux, Photoshop, MySQL, etc. It's software that obsoletes much of banking sector, obsoletes most currencies. While you can trade bitcoin units as a commodity that's a poor way to measure the bitcoin stack, it's more than that, much more.
Only through the lens of valuing bitcoin as software does it's true worth show itself. Other comparisons are too limited and flawed. And the truth is the bitcoin software and API as a whole, is ridiculously useful and therefor very very valuable.
Just looking at a subset of the components of bitcoin you miss the entire point, it's like trying to measure the value of Linux by just looking at the libraries used to create it.

The banks use to fuck the public over all the time when they got hacked, they called it ["identity theft"]( instead of what it really was, their shitty ass security model failing.
That didn't go over too well so they invented the charge back to "protect" the consumer. Except they didn't fix the broken ass security model they just moved their [externality]( onto the merchants.

As a consumer I *like* the no charge back nature of bitcoins. The chargeback system always seemed like a sweep it under the rug solution.

They treat the situation pretty damn serious when the consumer breaks a contract, maybe now we will hold businesses to the same standard.

Yes and no. Yes it will create production jobs, by eliminating the middle men, profit will go to the producers, that will be able to expand production and hire even more producers.
The problem is [this is happening]( and in less than a decade that's who the majority of producers will be "hiring". Remember the self driving car could complete the DARPA course the first year (2004) either, by the second several did, and now less than a decade later they are legally on the streets.

What's needed is an easy way to trade bitcoins inside the game, super micro transactions. Each player puts X bitcoins into a pool. Players can then use tiny fractions of a bitcoin to buy and sell the resources they mine. The bitcoins in the pool are distributed as random treasure chests, while anyone is free to add bitcoins to the game by purchasing resources, so it's pay to win but if someone spends more than the pot trying, you could very well end up with more than you started with, getting paid to lose.
For a more fair game each player can only spend up to what they bought in as. So at a 1BTC table you would put 1BTC into the pot and 1BTC is what you would have to start the game with.

Also that way it's a game of skill, not strictly gambling, like poker. Might be pretty damn good televised also.
 Some sort of MechWarrior Mercenaries online MMO with bitcions would be crazy awesome too. Especially once the Oculus Rift comes out.

This is overly generous, fake generous. Instead if he is feeling generous take a credit have a second meal, and try again on the third. Now the proprietor has something really valuable a repeat customer.
Paying twice is just admitting that bitcoin isn't ready when all that he needs to do is get a better wallet.
As for restaurants I expect a new model to form where you pay up front by scanning QR codes. The first time you see a waiter is when they bring you your drinks and appetizers. It's more convenient for the customer and all if there is any propagation problems it will have worked itself out by the time the meal is done.

She is a smart investor because she invested in her own family trusting the expertise of her decedent who has more knowledge than she does. She also waited a year to see how it worked out, not trying to micro-manage, but using the money to allow her grandchild to take a risk,  gain experience, and make mistakes without suffering a personal loss. This is not only good investing, it's good parenting (or grand-parenting in this case).
Considering she could wait a year, I'm sure the $1000 wasn't her life savings. If she is wealthy then the $1000 is a good amount for an experiment like this. It wasn't about making money for her I'm sure, it was about enabling her decedent to learn and grow on his own by providing adequate resources.

This couldn't be more untrue.

Bitcoins can also be fun as Monopoly money (small amounts that don't really matter) just to get to experience the technology. There are lots of nifty and fun things you can do with Bitcoin, and you get to help them do those things, spending time together exploring something that means something personal to you (assuming you are like me and care more about the tech than the price).

Not trolls, "economists" put themselves into huge amounts of debt and invest years of education to learn how to make themselves very very wealthy. It's the worst kind of science where everyone has every incentive to not tell the truth, to not publish their findings unless it helps them profit, etc. Corruption is at the very core of most economic teaching.
Bitcoins threaten that, they threaten to make their very expensive educations moot, they threaten to take away their future of being a "master of the universe", they threaten the power structure. Most people in live lives that depend on bitcoins failing. It's the perfect storm to cause cognitive dissonance.

I think people would be much better off if they could still afford to get an education without having to go into debt as it use to be, before "easy money". Student loan debt is now larger than credit card debt. It's not dischargeable by bankruptcy. And there are little to no jobs unless you are in a STEM field and even then it's not easy. So you have an entire generation now of indentured servants, paying just the interest on loans they will never pay back because they are flipping burgers. Reality isn't anything like the narrative used to trick children into taking life destroying debt for their "own good". You think the housing bubble was bad just wait until the education bubble pops.
Young people are already calling themselves the lost generation, they are educated but oppressed with no opportunities. They don't have anything to lose under the current system, it's promises have been nothing but dust to them, and if people don't start caring about that expect riots soon. Idle hands and all that.

For example don't accept that the commerce clause applies to everything money like the federal government says it does.

SpaceX just had another successful test of it's [Grasshopper]( platform (a falcon 9 first stage). While SpaceX have already brought down the cost of rocketry by an entire order of magnitude, add in the Grasshopper tech and you are looking at another order of magnitude drop in price.
That means we will have 100X the access to space than we did just a few years ago, a few years from now. And they aren't resting on their  laurels either, the next version of the Dragon already in development will have the Super Draco thrusters, designed to be capable of landing and taking off from Mars but have more than enough thrust for abort operations (necessary for manned ratings). Adding vertical landing will be a software problem.
A flood of space based resources is a real possibility in the next couple of decades, and it's inevitable in any time frames after that unless we suffer a world wide collapse scenario.

To all the downvoters while americandreamsicle's opinion may seem callous it's exactly his mentality that lead to bitcoin in the first place. It's called opting out. Having been an early FOSS adopter you learn that appealing to the masses only makes the signal to noise ratio worse. Better to just scratch your own itches, blaze the trail and just let the masses figure it out for themselves. It's like leading a horse to water. If the horse doesn't want to drink you still did all you could, you can't be responsible for everyone just because you started walking down the new path first.

It's spooky how many things seem to be described by information theory even things that existed long before the age of information.
If we describe the physical transportation of gold a sneaker net with very high pings we can see how bitcoin is superior to it and even judge their relative values, just as one example.
Taking it further if we assume both gold and bitcoins purpose is to be a currency and store of value, what critics call "intrinsic value" as in made of matter that you can hold is actually a detriment. Bitcoin is better than gold because it isn't a shiny rock.
Currency is, was, and always will be an exchange of information, everything else was just a side show.

And despite all the claims ASICs will not result in centralized mining operations, instead as production ramps up, costs come down, and bitcoins become ubiquitous, expect to see ASICs first in PCI cards, then integrated into motherboards, then added to chips like video decoders are today.

With Solarcity you can get free panels and installation all you do is continue to pay your electric bill like normal until the up front costs have been paid then they are yours. It's the best model I have seen for distributing solar power to those that can't afford the up front costs (like the poor).
With the Tesla gaining popularity it's kicking open the door to full electrics. You know what brown people would like (sorry "minorities"), for white people to stop bombing them for their oil.

So your only bitch is Bitcoiners won't lie down give up for you. Boo fucking hoo.
I'm not even an optimist just a pragmatist (the glass is twice the size it needs to be). Most "bad" news is just opportunity, when someone says they cant buy X they are really saying I want X take my money.
On the other hand actual bad news is blown way out of proportion. So what China blocked Bitcoin the price is still way way way up from two months ago, and we always knew it wasn't going to be easy. The only ones deluded seem to be the critics who think they know the hearts and minds of Bitcoiners better than Bitcoiners do. Now we get to see how Bitcoin adapts to government censorship, that's all. That's what us Bitcoiner's are thinking. We have a plan, for either eventually. Bad news is when you are taken completely by surprise, and that hasn't happened yet.

We are meeting with a local farmers market merchant about supplying non-bitcoin themed bags (made from different materials we have aloha themed scraps from another job), but the custom orders will all be in bitcoin. We hope that with Coinlab opening their doors soon acquiring bitcoins will be as easy as Paypal, making this venture possible. We want to be ready for when that happens.


That's the plan, because we live in Hawaii though it costs a minimum of $6 to ship anything. The bags at $10 are already three dollars less than you can find elsewhere. Using some of the advice we have gotten already we are planing on making a few boxes full of standard designs through Amazon and/or Bitcoinin to cut down on our shipping costs. Custom orders will still have to pay for shipping, though we can ship at least a couple dozen for the same $6.
Maybe we will set up a Paypal (even though we loathe them) option just to illustrate the cost difference and push customers toward bitcoins.

So many of us are self taught, precisely because bitcoin is understandable. The difficulty people seem to have is that they believe they understand the fiat system, when in fact they do not. They think they understand the US dollar and not bitcoins, when the truth is they understand neither without study.
If one is starting from scratch, bitcoins make sense, Keynesian debt is wealth economics not so much. People have been getting along just fine being ignorant so they think the fiat system must work more or less flawlessly, they don't know bitcoin though so it has to be proven to them. This isn't very logically sound, but that's humans for you, always it's an uphill battle against cognitive dissonance.

Well I live in Hawaii where most of the reasons for the tech not working is moot. We have access to massive currents between the islands. We have lots of unused and unusable coastline where can have wave generation, we have lots of sunshine where solar makes sense. We have volcanoes that make geothermal relatively easy. Lot's of people already live off grid here.
People are going to have to move where the power is at but I still don't see it as an insurmountable problem. The trick is using what makes sense where it makes sense, nothing is a panacea.
We also have many avenues for reducing our energy needs. Burning fuel in cars is the first, it's practically a no brainier that even with transmission costs (that could be alleviated by local or even residential solar voltaic and a smart grid) electric would be vastly more efficient. Throw in robotic cars and trucks that are super efficient by drafting within inches of each other and don't need to be owned individually we could seriously put a dent in our energy usage.
We don't have the choice to throw our hands up and give up, billions will die. We have to at least try, otherwise our children are going to lynch us. Just look at how little sympathy the baby boomers have been receiving lately, that mentality is only going to get worse unless we make the efforts required of us succeed or fail.

Hoarding bitcoin isn't bad because it's basically investing in the entire bitcoin economy. When you hoard they become more rare, the value goes up, those who spend gain that value, you exchanged for your immediate spending power for future greater spending power.
That's the magic of a deflationary currency. It really puts pressure on only investing in long term gains that will outweigh deflation. It's the reason the gold standard was so successful.

Sort of, they credited me $120 for a $30 order but I bought at $240. So as long as BTC doesn't dip below $60 I haven't lost anything yet. I also bought some at $5 so for me to lose money it would have to go very low indeed.
This isn't my first bubble, I'll just keep on hanging on, and maybe pick up some cheap coins while the getting is good (not until things stabilize). Considering the magnitude of this attack and the corresponding drop, I'll probably spend more (keep my value in stuff, I'm poor so I can always use something, maybe I'll get a generator so I can camp and not pay rent) on the next rise and do some dollar cost averaging. It's what all the cool cucumbers do, keeps them sane in this crazy market while still making money.

And when that happens to banks instead of calling it a bank heist its ["identity theft"]( So you are double fucked. At least when exchanges get hacked they are on the hook and you can sue them. Also you are crazy if you think big banks weren't a cluster fuck of poor security back when they first went digital all the way up to today. Remember ActiveX? The exchanges have much better track records for security in a much more hostile environment with far fewer resources and much less experience than major banks. He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.


Backups are not hard, yes people need to learn to do them, they should teach that shit in grade school. We have thousands of ways to back shit up a good amount of them are free, and people should be doing that anyway with all their personal digital files. You don't keep your stock certificates on your coffee table do you? No you keep them in a safe or safety deposit box. Same thing with bitcoins. If you really must have someone hold your hand I'll do it, no problem, lets talk fees.


Hardware wallets are coming very soon and this will be a non-problem. Until then yes you are expected to practice some basic security, something you should be doing anyway. How to do so is well documented, easy to follow (if you can put together ikea furniture you can do it yourself) and *freely* available.


That's ridiculous. And if there are that many uber stupid people out there start a bank where you do nothing but charge people for this basic stupid easy shit, and make lots of money doing it for them. That is until you are replaced with easy to use software. Knowing how fast programers work I would get on that sooner than later.

Over the last 30 days BTC has still gained very well even after a **massive** ongoing attack (possibly hundreds of Gbps DDoS attack community wide MtGox was reporting 80 all on its own, even mining pools were taken down).

Because if they try it just proves they suck at math.
If they crash the bitcoin, it's because they want it dead, buying back in again is against their interests. If a crash happens again, this time there will be 100x the true believers as last time ready to scoop them up again at the much cheaper price. The pool of available bitcoins to try manipulating the market will be much smaller, the big boys will have to spend billions to do it again, and that's only if they can convince all their friends to not jump the fence, greedy people don't have the best impulse control. Remember in their world being a cocksucker is how you get ahead.

Buy bitcoins because you believe in freedom, buy bitcoins because you don't have faith in fiat, buy bitcoins because they are an interesting experiment, buy bitcoins because you have done the math and see the real value, hell even buy bitcoins because it's a great gamble to be an early adopter.
Don't buy bitcoins to day trade, unless you are a pro you are just going to be a victim.
As long as you have a good personal reason to bitcoin you will live a much better life than those just playing numbers games. Make plans, have a dream, this is a currency that makes dreams possible, use it that way and set yourself free.

I fixed that for you. The primary reason we don't have some empirical measurement of currency is because we largely have no idea how the whole system works.
Bitcoin isn't backed by anything because backing has always been a red herring. The bitcoin hypothesis of currency is the one that can do the most transactions with the least censorship (taxes, middle men, gate keepers, inflation etc) will have the most value, and therefor the highest price.
Bitcoin is unbeatable measured that way. Bitcoins eventual success will go a long way to unifying economics as an actual science, by giving us some inarguable baselines to work from.

The problem is fiat is poorly defined for modern use. Bitcoins are sufficiently different than every other fiat currency ever to deserve it's own category, either that or we need a word that means "government issued fiat currencies". It's just easier to make an exception for bitcoins.

Honestly capital gains are free money, you have to be wise enough to see opportunities but after that, it's just sit back and wait. Capital gains should be taxed the highest, while income tax (taxes on earning stuff) should be lower. Both should be progressive taxes with the poor paying the least and the wealthy paying the most as the wealthy use a disproportionate amount of the collective resources, and flattening the wealth gap raises everyone.
I would rather pay taxes to live in a modern world than be Emperor of ancient Rome, even poor people live better than the highest of our predecessors.

They are partially right. Bitcoin is going to flatten the supply line. Middle men and rent seekers are doomed. That means a lot less office jobs. Not none, but vastly fewer.
GDP is calculated including pure costs like the finance sector and health. A good hurricane or outbreak can do a lot to boost the GDP. So GDP will go down but life quality for producers of real value (and bitcoin early adopters) will go up.

Some people just can't grasp that things can work without an authority to say so and will just make up the most ridiculous things they could have easily been proven wrong if they would just read a FAQ.
To the newbies, if it seems like we have an answer for everything, it's because we have seen the same questions hundreds of times now. You are still catching up, act like it. Instead of charging in here telling everyone why they are wrong, try asking about your concerns.
Most of us early adopters had the exact same concerns you do, we got over them by educating ourselves.

That's cool too, we need savers as well. Just consider if you spend BTC where you can and replace it with the fiat you were going to spend anyway, it would stimulate the Bitcoin economy making what you do hold gain value even faster.

Bought a half though only with money I could afford to lose, held it to help mitigate in my own tiny way the damage to the noobs (not that it's appreciated, they are butthurt but it will pass). Also have a few from back when they were $5. BTC is holding at around $80, during one of the biggest DDoS attacks I have ever seen. MtGox alone is reported to be seeing 80Gbsp, smaller exchanges are getting hit with 10Gbps+, the chart sites as well have reported DDoS traffic, and even mining pools were taken off line. And still BTC is holding ground. That's pretty fucking amazing if you ask me.
I'll be buying more very soon. This was an attack on bitcoin, not a pump and dump, fuck those guys I don't give in to bullies.

@_date: 2013-04-02 19:35:25


You think I am but I have considered my opinion very carefully. Don't just assume you know what I have and haven't thought about.


You are going to have to explain your reasoning here, bitcoin is obviously much more than just a commodity, it's a communication protocol, it's a solution to the [Byzantine Generals' Problem]( as well as having a bunch of features baked into the protocol that haven't been implemented yet. As I see it the stack has a value, this value is based on it's over all usefulness as software (perceived or otherwise). That value is divided evenly among the individual bitcoin units. What value does the bitcoin stack provide? Well at a minimum if banking is a multitrillion dollar industry world wide, and bitcoin can replace a significant amount of that then that's it's value, pretty simple. That's before you consider the networking effects and the rise in efficiency that the overall economy would realize by having to pay much smaller fees to participate in monetary exchanges.
If you think this is wrong, if you think you can measure the value of a complex system by just looking at one variable then you are going to have to justify that.


This is nonsensical, I don't know any other way to put it. Nobody sells the Linux kernel either but that doesn't mean it isn't worth billions. Unless bitcoin forks take a significant amount of the crypto currency market it will have no effect, if they do then you would divide the value of the of the stack among the competing currencies. But that doesn't mean the value doesn't exist so just looking at BTC as a commodoty is still incorrect.

On the other hand we can monitor the worlds governments the same way when bitcoin obsoletes their currencies. Forcing the biggest players to play fair and square will create so much efficiency there would be far fewer reasons to try and cheat the system.
Anonymity only works when it's equal, and we are far past the point where the individual can share the same anonymity as a government. The easier solution is to dispose of it all together, putting everyone on equal footing again.
Sometimes the solution is to just push on through to the other side.

You would be wrong, it just happens to be that the Linux kernal is so amazingly efficient that it makes up for the lackluster performance of GPU drivers on the platform. GPU makers just don't invest nearly the amount of resources to optimize the Linux drivers as they do the Windows ones, and they haven't bothered to work with the OSS drivers or developers very much at all. That's changing now with Valve, they are getting patches because they got the $$$ to make AMD and nVidia sit up and pay attention.
I'm not saying game performance is bad under Linux, I'm saying Linux is already so much better than Windows when it comes to overhead it should be beating the snot of it instead of being comparable in performance.

It was a traditional DDoS bitcoin industry wide, from the markets to the charts, even the miners got hit. It was an nontraditional DDoS that took down the markets with thousands of micro transactions executed all at once, and overwhelming demand. The perfect storm to cover up a pump and dump.

Sure I'm one of the true believers around here.
We are opting out of your game and playing our own. The rules you learned don't govern us. There is overlap but the differences mean your education is doing you a disservice. Us true believers have analyzed the algorithm, it's not trust we have even belief is a poor word, it's the certainty you only get with science and math.
Bitcoins started as an experiment to prove a hypothesis, that a simpler solution to currencies is not just possible but preferable and more efficient. Surviving the first crash put us from hypothesis into firm theory land, bitcoins worked exactly as advertised.
So why is this true believer investing? Because I see the value of obsolescence as the strongest force in human history. Bitcoins are the embodiment of Austrian economic theory. Where savers are valued over spenders and that it's a good thing. That wasting money on plastic crap from Walmart had done us no good. That privatizing gains and socializing losses is inherently wrong and we don't have to allow that sort of thing.
Bitcoins have changed the way I think about money. I'm invested not just in myself but in the entire bitcoin economy. Just a couple of days ago I gave away half my tip bot account to random stoners on and it didn't cost me a dime because that account had doubled though no effort of my own, yet I was able to reach thousands of potential users (the hundreds posting to the thread plus the silent majority of lurkers). My money worked for me not against me and I didn't need anyone to give me permission or charge a fee (well the tip bot and the standard .0005 miner fee but I like paying those, every little bit helps). We are learning to stand on the shoulders of ourselves and soon we will be giants, it's the opposite of the rat race. I belive in a future that's brighter than today and bitcoins are the vehicle that will take us down the first steps to that path.
That also makes me and those like me that absolute bottom that bitcoin can fall (or some other crypto currency there could be a fork or something). Even if a massive pump and dump was created to destroy faith in bitcoins I would just buy them for pennies and make sure to distribute them in a sustainable and healthy way, because I don't need faith I have math. People are wising up to this fact in a major way, nobody has much faith in any of the plutocrats or their world any longer and long for a way out, bitcoin is the only avenue available today and that's a big deal.
That's what bitcoins are to me and a quickly growing population, trying to kill that idea is very difficult, throw in the network effects and the power of obsolescence and it's impossible, the only real question is how long it's going to take.
I'll close with my favorite quote.

Actually it isn't, bitcoin is an API, it's software, it's more like using Linux over Windows, you are making a policy choice.
Or it is, because it's traded like stock and it's value is determined by trading it.
Or it isn't because bitcoin is a currency...
Bitcoin is unique because it's so many things rolled into one, it depends on your perspective.
For me I value the API above all, I see the true value (thus price) of all currencies as a reflection of it's utility. The more utility a currency possesses (the more work you can do with it with the least amount of friction) the higher it's value to the economy it represents.
From my perspective bitcoin isn't risky, it's all other currencies that haven't done squat to prevent corruption at the highest levels that are risky. Gold is risky because it can be easily taken from you. Fiat is risky because some asshat can just decide to print a billion more of them on a whim. Only with BTC can I be secure knowing the rules aren't going to change mid game.
Some of us are also pretty decent at seeing the future coming, it wasn't risky for many to get involved in the early internet, they just saw the inevitable coming. Many of us are sure about bitcoin (well technically cryptocurrencies of which bitcoin is the leader) in the same way we were sure about the internet, we just know things most people don't.

Every attempt to take out the Obama inspired change branding has failed in my view. These only work if you already know about bitcoins. This one makes it seem like bitcoins are only worth spare change on your cell phone.
The entire genius of the first design was that "change" was being used ironically. Strip that out and it looses all punch with anyone not already informed about bitcoins.
Remember adds are not about preaching to the quire or appealing to your own tastes, it's about eyeballs and branding. The original had balance in it's colors with red, white, and blue. While the black and white indicated that they were different paradigms, yen and yang if you will. The Obama branding was a great use of irony (indicated by the black background), clearly understood by anyone with even a passing familiarity with the "hope and change" imagery.

Very good question.
This is a very long and very complicated subject. Not because of bitcoins but because of the legacy systems that you also don't really understand (none of us do, even professional economists and high powered bankers can find disagreements on everything, it's not an insult). I'll start by assuming we are living in a bitcoin only economy.
The idea is that gold, housing, education, and all other products that are purchased with "easy money" aka loans, and are considered stores of value naturally rise in price. Easier the money the higher the price goes, the higher the price goes the more people treat their property as an investment. It is a feedback loop that creates bubbles because there really isn't anything backing the large values other than easy access to even more money though loans. By acting as an alternative to other stores of value Bitcoin will eventually pop those bubbles.
It's just not reasonable for shitty apartments to cost a million dollars or more no matter where they are located. Houses should be for living in not investing in. Because Bitcoin is (hypothetically in our bitcoin only future) the primary store of value all other value stores will come down in price. Houses will be priced what they are worth for living in, gold will be priced what it's useful for in industry, education will be competitive again without all the high priced book scams and constantly rising tuition.
The depreciating nature of bitcoin also means your savings are protected. So it is actually possible to save for these big purchases much much faster than the fiat system that's constantly taking your value in the form of inflation.
It's the difference between a supply side economic model and a demand driven economic model. The former is so inefficient that it requires loans to work, while the latter creates competition that makes it possible to save for what you need avoiding rent seekers.
That's the hypothesis at least, though in practice it seems to be working exactly as predicted.
Now between a Bitcoin only future and today, you have the network effect and several thousand percent gains yearly that mitigates the need for loans as well. If things keep on track I'll have gone from destitute to owning property on a tropical island in less than three years. It's good being an early adopter, but the long term goal is to create a stable economy where you can earn your way up and goods and services are priced what they are worth not what someone can extort your for.

Sucks to be a day trader unless you are one of the lucky ones, but people that hold know how to weather these storms and improve their real lives in the processes. Paper worth is just that, paper.

Inspired by this [TED Talk]( is one example of what bitcoiners are planing on doing with their wealth. Same goes with 3D printing, and other state of the art technologies that haven't gotten their fair share of investment. Young people have a very hard time in this world. The older generation have mostly spent any inheritece we expected to be there for us so it's become DIY. With bitcoin making those with the most forward vision and reason wealthy expect to see a large spike in R&amp;D soon.
That's the beauty of bitcoin, the only things worth doing with them are things worth doing. They don't reward the lazy or the risk adverse.
I expect to see over the next decade a return to exploration as the vehicle of humanities future.
Some day when I my BTC are worth millions my plan is to go to Mars, with the cost of rocketry coming down by orders of magnitude (SpaceX is already 10X than their next closest competitor and Grasshopper tech hasn't even flown on a real mission yet) it's a very reasonable dream.

I'm not kidding anyone, I'm just cautiously optimistic. One of the most important rules over at is that technology accelerates. I'm guessing (an educated guess) that we are already sitting on the curve leading up to the hockey stick. Only a few more pieces of the puzzle are needed for wide spread adoption and that work is coming along smartly. When bitcoins happen they are going to happen very very quickly.

Humans suck at telling how close things are when it comes to technology. The [law of accelerating returns]( definitely fits bitcoin adoption.

Why do people upvote this crap? We are done tolerating oppressors (well some of us, those pushing the tech and not just trying to get rich), we are fighting a war. It's an economic war but make no mistake it's for **all** the marbles.

Thank you very much for pointing this out. It was the bankers at the time that created the "technology bubble" once again privatizing the profits (insider IPOs for start-ups that had nothing but a website) and socializing (blaming technology) the losses.

I'm information addicted, literally, I can't stop. I read Satoshi's white paper when it was linked to by /. just before the first bubble. After that it was a cluster fuck of forums, message boards, chat rooms, and meat space conversations where I learned what was going on at the leading edge of development.


I googled it when I ran across the phrase and didn't understand it (I'm a RTFM kind of guy).


I try not to, I'm better with big picture hand wavy engineering than really digging into particulars. I wait until people like you figure shit out and just check your work. I then use that knowledge to both position myself strategically for the future as well as pontificate endlessly on Check out Ray Kurzweil's law of [accelerating returns]( and also the [network effect]( if you are trying to explain bitcoin's rapid growth. While on the surface exponential growth looks like a scam or a bubble there are many reasons for it to not only be normal but necessary.
Being a dreamer I have internalized this knowledge long ago, I expect accelerating returns so I have better instincts than most because I don't fear it. That doesn't really make me good at explaining it though, the best I can do is link people the knowledge that lead me to my current understanding. We need people like you to explain it clearly.

That's a good thing. If our computers are not secure something needs to happen to force the issue. Bitcoin is already responsible for an upgraded [RNG on Android]( phones for example. Maybe Bitcoin will finally get people using more secure operating systems and open source software like Linux instead of Windows and we would all be better off.
I know it starts to sound crazy that everything is "good news" but these are the challenges Bitcoin was created to overcome, this is it's purpose. It needs conflict to drive innovation, necessity is the mother of invention.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:41:14


Doubtful, the damage will happen one way or the other. Look at how much Obama tried to placate the Republicans and meet them half way, they still blamed him for everything including the weather. Same thing is going to happen to bitcoins one way or the other, you don't fight that, it's a loosing battle. You win by just being better, let bitcoins speak for themselves. I remember when Wikipedia was the devil, now it's ubiquitous because it was just a better way to encyclopedia with obvious benefits. Enough people get wealthy on bitcoin or enough go broke on fiat and people will flock to bitcoins no matter the rhetoric.
It's still a good idea to put bitcoins best foot forward but fearing/avoiding the perceived negatives isn't smart, being honest is a far better than avoiding the issue. Hell lots of people love drugs, productive, hard working, honest people, Silicon Vally basically runs on weed. Bitcoins being backed by drugs means there is a price floor no matter what. I don't see what's so negative about that. If someone doesn't want to adopt them for those reasons then I'm happy to watch the world leave them and their opinions behind, as wealth is transferred to the inventive, clever, or at least adventurous, where it will be leverage to create the world in their image.

It was the other way around, well sort of. Having a fair economic model was a prerequisite for the prosperity that was realized during those time periods, but the value came from the natural resources.

Long term holders and spenders will gain a lot more than the day traders that are vocal as shit one day because they are "winning" then gone forever when shit goes wrong once. Encouraging that behavior is going to get people fucked. This is exactly the kind of bad advice this sub doesn't need.
The best way to win for the average person if you actually believe in bitcoin is to do dollar cost averaging. If you don't believe in bitcoins then you are gambling and you should tell people that up front, if that's how you are defining "winners and losers".

I just keep comforting myself with this quote:


To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”
― Richard Buckminster Fuller
Perception definitely has power, but nothing like the inevitability of obsolescence. Sure bitcoins are a bit of a pain to use, it's like the bad old days before the fancy features of your favorite mega retailer, but still far better than pre-internet (lets not forget that wasn't that long ago) no matter how you measure it. Those who take the trouble will be rewarded, those that don't will have to wait. That's a good thing, we want those with vision and initiative to have the resources to create their dreams, thus adding even more value to the bitcoin economy.
Continuing the analogy, I would say bitcoins are already off to college and in a few short years will be schooling the world.

The good new is if it was Russian mobsters once they are in they lose all reason to attack the network, they know too many crashes will hurt them.
If it was central banks or an arm of a major Government, watching the price hold strong at $60 makes me feel much better about our odds against these attacks in the future.

They might be able to. And kids are the perfect demographic to take huge risks, nearly nobody has much to show for their childhood purchases. It almost all gets broken or lost, so even loosing everything in bitcoin isn't a big deal and would teach a valuable lesson. And in the processes they would learn about investing, economics, budgets, diversification, all sorts of things we should teach at a much younger age but often doesn't happen at all, and the worst thing that can happen is they are out a few allowances or lawn mowing money.

Bitcoin runs over TCP/IP, it's part of the internet, and just like the internet it interprets censorship as damage and routes around. The last time China decided to censor the internet we got the TOR network and VPNs exploded in popularity. Today only poor or ignorant people are overly affected by the great firewall of China. In fact a friend that just came back from China was telling me they basically don't care if you can route around the firewall. It's only there to keep the peasants safe, and once you figure out a way to get around it they figure you must know what you are doing and mostly leave you alone.
So I expect Chinese resistance to accelerate distributed markets, tumbling services, etc. Like an immune system what doesn't kill it makes it stronger (except aids but it's just a shitty analogy). Sometimes you need a good challenge to the system to create fitness functions to improve it leading to slower but even more inevitable adoption. And if China ends up unable to contain Bitcoin we can pretty much assume no nation will successfully completely control it.

That's fair. Still I wouldn't call what happened today HFT. There were no server farms with direct access to the markets analyzing microsecond changes, there were no fancy bots doing complicated math. It was a dead simple attack, make thousands 0.01 sells at X price in a single command (through the API) followed by thousands of buys, all the heavy lifting was done on MtGox's end. Classic denial of service, the goal wasn't even to make money these attacks have been going on too long for that theory to hold much water. The attacks of tiny trades were to do one thing and that's to consume CPU resources and crash the market.
It's a very good chance this was a major bank (like the Fed) or a government. Keeping up attacks of this magnitude costs a lot of money, botnets are not free. This one has had some major exposure there is a good chance that the security community will be all over it like white on rice in the coming weeks.

Among those reasons is chasing out to buy infrastructure to start your bitcoin business. I wouldn't be surprised to see early adopters cashing out just to get back into the game on the service side of things. Just sitting on bitcoins and watching charts gets old, eventually with a big enough war chest, you start to feel the need to be proactive.

I don't think the Chinese care about the price as much as they just want bitcoins. They are spending all that wealth they earned with cheap labor on all sorts of shit from government debt, to land and property world wide. From what I can tell this is another Chinese land grab, I doubt it's going to end soon, they aren't stupid over there.

They are doing all they can to navigate the clusterfuck that is the legacy currency systems so their costumers don't have to. It's a tough job, but they bring in lots of people to bitcoin that wouldn't have the expertise to do so themselves. This is why you get to keep the massive gains of early adoption though, you have to put up with early infrastructure and take chances.
If everything was easy bitcoins would be worth a hell of a lot more.

Or we have been wrong about money all along. We might as well be flat-earthers, we got it that wrong.
If you instead think of money as software (technically an API) all along it starts to make since.
Gold is a natural money, it's rare enough but not to rare, it's heavy but you don't have to carry much of it, you can hide it, eat it, lock it in a box and guard it if you want to, so it can be secured. These features would be the best they could do with what they could find for early merchants.
So gold can be transmitted (sneakernet), but only slowly and ping times suck. It's a pretty good store of value. And it can be exchanged just about anywhere, though the price varies port to port.
Seen that way gold is essentially an API for money, though with many drawbacks.
When gold just became too scarce for everyone to have some we moved to paper, it has some advantages, and many disadvantages that are easily hidden behind the veneer of finance. Since even the experts cant quite agree on "what money really is" it's pretty easy to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.
Then comes along bitcoin, all the features of gold, none of the bugs, along with a bunch of features never before imagined because we just weren't thinking of money as an API, all published in a publicly available white paper.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:35:27
The real revelation of bitcoin is money is information, always has been. The more "efficient" and "accurate" the "ledger", and the faster the "network" can transmit that information directly reflects the true value of a currency.
To explain my scare quotes (in no particular order), when I say ledger I'm talking bout how a currency tracks and maintains an entities wealth relative to others. This goes all the way back to gold and sea shells. While you may not be able to track where someone got their gold or shells you can physically look at someones pile of it and make a comparison, it's primitive but works. If someone has more gold than another you know sometime somewhere in history that person or their  forbears did something to acquire that wealth.
When I say network, up until computers I am talking about sneaker net. Gold is pretty good at this but it's no surprise that paper took off they way it did, it's lighter and comes in many denominations. The better the network the more valuable the currency (this is where credit cards gain their advantage).
Efficiency of a currency is it's ability to transmit value with the least cost. The more middle men that are required (just look at the enormity of the banking sector there is no way just moving money around requires that many resources), the fewer opportunities there are available to put that money to work.
The accuracy of a currency is it's ability to maintain the wealth of it's users without corruption. For example inflation can be argued to be corruption within the system rewarding some and punishing others invisibly and without debate or consent. While this may or may not be a "good thing" for society it defiantly isn't for the value of a currency.
Scarcity is interesting in that it is a required prerequisite of all functioning currencies but the actual value (one highly divisible unit or billions of individual units) doesn't really matter as long as there is enough granularity to support the economy the currency represents. As long as you are over that figure (I'll leave what that figure is as an exercise for the reader, it's beyond my understanding) you are fine.
If my hypothesis about the nature of money is accurate, bitcoin wins hands down in every way. Many others are also waking up to this new reality, either consciously through analysis or unconsciously through the feeling of dread their money gives them sitting in their pocket but not under their control.
The more you look at it the more you realize that the entire field of economics wasn't created to scientifically understand monetary systems, it was created to justify unmitigated greed. It took a bunch of nerds with just enough economics knowledge to make a working system but not so much to be brain washed by appeals to authority (ridiculousness like inherent value comes from the sate, it's an obvious logical fallacy) to create better money (cryptocurrencies).
TL:DR; Money is information, bitcoin is the best tool for transmitting and securing monetary data, to the Moon!

It's easy to be bold when things look like they are going well, but to be truly bold one must do so in the face of adversity.
So be bolder, hold and program something useful with bitcoins, when bitcoin rises so will you. Your programming ability makes you uniquely qualified to really benefit from bitcoin, it's spec work but we were talking bout boldness.

TL;DR. Well I got about a third of the way though then just started skimming, so correct me if I'm wrong but you seemed to have missed the value of the network and bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoins have intrinsic value because the network itself is a tool, like a hammer, you can build things with it, and bitcoins are the atoms that make up that hammer.
In my experience that's something that network/software people just get and money/politics people have a very difficult time coming to terms with.

The market doesn't know squat, nobody knows if we are even going to make it to 2140 and by the time we do get that far nobody knows how many coins will have been lost, it's all just guessing.
Supply and demand on the other hand is a real if not easily measured thing, there are only so many coins people are willing to sell at any given time, introduce more coins into the system and some will be sold driving the price down. Inflation matters.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:05:19


Yes, but only with money you can afford to lose, so your point is moot.


That's because you think enthusiasm is synonymous with a persons position when it isn't. People can be just as excited to watch their $100 double as someone who is all in, you can't judge a persons level of risk by their excitement.
Anyone that has been around here for very long knows that don't invest more than you can afford to lose, bitcoin is volitile, and don't day trade hold as a long term investment until you feel qualified to do otherwise are the cardinal rules around here. I don't even know how many more times it can be said without it being spammy.
You do those three very simple things (that you should have been taught by your parents and/or school long before you got here anyway) and you will not be harmed. Don't [blame Bitcoin]( because basic investing education doesn't happen or people don't listen.

I should my GF is a cam girl (she is an exhibitionist I'm a voyeur its a match made in dirty dirty heaven) and not a single fucking developer wants to listen to us.
Games people games, those tips would just flood in. If you have ever been on one of the more popular cam sites you see girls with spinners, girls with sex dice, anything they can do to drum up interest, but it isn't the same, you need sound effects, pretty colors, that feeling like you are in control, but most importantly **instant satisfaction**. With bitcoin it's easy no need for a credit card, nothing to appear on your statement, joining would be as simple as a user name and password, load points with bitcoins, done.
Compete against cam girls in multiplayer games, except the customer would have a hell of a handicap that they could pay to reduce. Pay to win basically, with sounds ****bing**** she takes off her top ****bing**** off comes the bra ****bing fireworks**** out comes the pussy, just keep pushing those mental "I'm winning" buttons like those Zinga games people obsess over like crack.
It's like cam site developers don't want money.
For casino games the members charge up their accounts with bitcoins but the girls play with house points. Once a player reaches some point total the girl strips. Members can keep playing until they run out of points. That covers Poker, Blackjack, Craps, Slots, etc. Plus titties hanging out is bound to put players off their game, and it isn't technically gambling as there is no payout.
Other possible games include 1v1 Fighting games, all manner of flash games, alternate reality games (scripted acting basically), interactive sex toys over the internet (dildo plugged into the sound card so customers can control the power with voice, music, or even micro payment pay to click settings, etc). Rhythm games with that previously mentioned sound powered dildo/egg (as long as you keep pumping bitcoins in she is distracted and has to strip as a reward if you beat her).
And on and on and on. That's the killer feature, there is no amount of free porn that can match that.

Well it's more like buying into an entire market not just one stock, but otherwise correct. The same is true of any "savings" then, it's just investing in a currency. I chose to invest in a deflationary currency because I don't like my money being stolen from me by people I don't even know. I don't have debts so inflation doesn't do anything for me. To us "pay with cash" people, the benefits are obvious. YMMV.
