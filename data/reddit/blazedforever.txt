I've always felt that BitGo's wallet was one of the best, been using it for a while now really don't want to stop . The multisig features and interface are nice.  I imagine there will be some updates soon to watch tx'ns more closely.
@_date: 2016-04-23 17:53:17
I also have thoughts on bitcoin development as an authority. I believe that since bitcoin is an open source project and has spinoff code, it's really a game of survival of the fittest. If core code starts to suck the true authorities  (the people, the miners) will migrate naturally. So far bitcoin core works good.

yeah I could have said more, but don't you think this enough of a hook to get him thinking? He was arguing that bitcoin has no value and I showed him why it does. The ability to have a transaction of value time-stamped and validated in a decentralized way is the core utility in bitcoin. what did i miss?
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:38:58
I was hoping the guy would at least make an attempt to back up his claim, even if he is fooling everyone. like just how old are these bitcoins he has? super computer???

Actually that's pretty much how the conversation would go if I had continued.  It's so useful. Then I would go on to how bitcoin can create incentive for content creators and such.

Ok about the cold wallets, what Andreas said was that he believes mtgox blamed txn maleability for losses. The losses would not be possible if coins were actually stored cold. This makes sense and i agree, i am however not making a "faith based assertion" but a "fact based assertion".

I don't think they are responsible for the first big bubble. People saw the bull trend and acted on it, thinking they would get rich. So some people blogged about bots and gave them names and people were like oohh that's why the price was soo high... the reason why is because people speculate.

I agree that most of those definitions don't exactly roll off the tongue. We as a community should really agree on something solid and easy. The bitcoin.it wiki does seem to be a main hub, so we would have to change it there but also I would suggest adding it to the bitcoin.org vocabulary [page]( Also why does bitcoin.org not have its own wiki?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:40:05
Everything is explained. Mtgox scandal and the whole bitcoin concept. Andreas beleves there was no true cold storage and makes very good points. Also why bitcoin is monumental for humanity! Humans try to de-risk everything and that is our main dysfunction!

I believe centralization is currently mankind's biggest disorder. Once you begin to analyze deeply you will realize that greed/ego/selfishness are all examples of detremental centralization and create unnessisary amounts of growth resistance. Decentralization literally can save mankind, extinguishing many fires (think burning bridges) that may very well spread and destroy mankind long term. Its a bit more than just some mediocre

I don't think you get it. Its very simple, bitcoin is a network of trust, and trust is extremely valuable.  volitility will go down in time as  trust grows, and at this point in time the volitility actually lures people's attention which it great for growth.
@_date: 2014-11-08 20:06:03
From bitcoin F.A.Q  
Why do people trust Bitcoin?
Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.

So if mark is DPR and satoshi and the feds have control of the 800k bitcoins + satoshis wallet they must have 2 million or so coins, in wich they shorted all year long and probably made 100:1 profit. This sounds like bad. Its probably not a good idea to let the feds control the price.

I won't be surprised to see this scenario or similar happen. Bitcoin creates a genuine display of human trading psychology and it seems to be quite fractal in nature.

I don't think you realize how useful this is. Think about adoption! what they are doing is bringing into the limelight "embedded bitcoin electronics" more people will now try to replicate the 21 computer and now you have a market for bitcoin embedded hardware and machine retrofit services. All of a sudden number of nodes start to grow.
@_date: 2015-09-23 12:51:34
How many people are actually using rasPi with bitcoin right now? The way i see it this is a proof of concept showing that small embedded electronics like the rasPi can be used to support the bitcoin ecosystem. Now that people have seen an iteration backed by 21 they will respect these tiny pieces of hardware more and see a wider spectrum of use cases. Next you will see vending machine companies using the 21 box or something similar to allow acceptance of btc. No they are not going to go hobby style and buy the ras pi and whatever additional hardware, they will include the hardware that is an all in one package tested and working. now think if you have 100,000 vending machines mining bitcoin and providing bitcoin service, will that help distribute the hashing power? Yes it will.
