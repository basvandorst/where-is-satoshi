This whole post is a reason for you to get out if crypto... I’m sorry if that sounds mean. But I’m just  being blunt. I’m sure your great at many things. But the world of investing in cryptocurrency is not one of them. Transfer back to coinbase and sell back to fiat. That is the best advice I can give you. Best of luck!
