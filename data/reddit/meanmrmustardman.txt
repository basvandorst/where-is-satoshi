I've comprehended that you are a fool who can't keep an argument going without abandoning the premise and resorting to ad hominem attacks that are utterly baseless. Did I miss anything else?

I value my life over my possessions. That's not arrogance. Arrogance would be thinking you can get your way out of a situation you have not fully ascertained. Such as punching someone in the nose who then stabs or shoots you repeatedly. 
The only time I would resist in a mugging would be if I knew for a fact that I could incapacitate the mugger nearly immediately without the mugger being able to successfully stop me. It's my own take on what the US military uses - the doctrine of overwhelming force. Also known as don't start what you can't finish.

I'm not a coward. If I get mugged, the guy may or may not have a knife or a gun. You don't punch your way out of that.
If I have a gun on me, I use it. If I have a knife on me the only time it's worth using it is if I know the first time the robber will notice the knife is as it's in his throat or lungs.
Let's say you don't have the element ofsurprise- you throw your dukes up and the robber stabs your or shoots you and flees. You pull a knife out- the robber shoots you and flees.
Between my wallet, watch and clothes the most I've ever carried on me is around $3-4000. That's not worth dying for.

As much as it would be great to stop a robber on principle, unless you have a gun and are ready to use it you may be shit out of luck. 
I have never carried anything in my pockets or worn anything on my waist or wrist that is wroth dying for.

Thank you. Forlarren is probably upset about betting the wrong way on some short term btc investment. I have no clue how a human brain can come to the conclusions he has. This entire thread is amusing.

Doesnt the finite nature of bitcoins complicate your theory?
The scarcity of the bitcoin as more people buy in is what everyone hopes to guarantee value not just investor psychology.

If you are getting robbed your choice is whether or not to resist.

You're an idiot. 
I don't live in fear. I'm not in fear until I perceive a threat. Personally, I would never mug someone without a gun. I think it's safe to prepare for that possibility while getting mugged. 
If you mug me and I have my CCW weapon on me, you're dead. If I'm unarmed you're probably going to succeed. This whole thing is concept you seem to be unfamiliar with called 'pick your battles.' This coward named Sun Tzu said that almost 3000 years ago. 
You call me a coward because I don't think possessions are worth dying for. You are a fool.
