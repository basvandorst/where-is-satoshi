If I had listened to advice like that I wouldn't have finally jumped on the train at 6k.

I can't find it, I know that undermines the credibility but it was posted on facebook and the site has no real functioning search ability. Even manually scrolling posts from a page it doesn't show everything that has been posted. I see the side he was coming from about ALL transactions being public and being able to recreate a user profile even from supposed "anonymous" sources, but the alternative to a public blockchain ledger is either fiat or trading goods/services in person. You need a way to do transactions electronically, remotely, and so far I havnt seen Dr. Paul offer a better solution than blockcahin, so to see him hop on the "its a conspiracy to take away your privacy" bandwagon is disappointing. And a position I hope he has changed.

It was just a few weeks ago he did a video talking about the dangers of a cashless society and speaking against the public ledger blockchain technology...

I'm reading IRS pub. 544, like kind exchanges; if my understanding is correct (i'm not an expert) you do have to report every single transaction, but if you trade like property you do not owe tax if there isnt a gain. So 100 USD of BTC for 100 USD of Doge there is no tax liability, but you are required to record and submit the transaction on form 8824.

That seemed like a rough draft that needed proof reading, I answered anyway justbecause. 
The federal reserve ruined the dollar, I think we need a federal reserve to ruin bitcoin too. toats.
