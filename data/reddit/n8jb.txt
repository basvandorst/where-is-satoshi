The idea for two was the two different regions and they'd use different currencies. I'm very open to feedback, so if folks here think it should just be one, then I'll do that :)

Gotcha. I'll have to reconsider then. Seems like people are specifically hating on this just because of that, which is a damn shame, as I went into this optimistic and in full support of cryptos as a whole. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:37:00
Yeah, with the whole title of the game and everything revealed and all that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:20:04
What do you mean? :) 
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:00:09
Thanks for the fast response and clarification :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:18:37
Yeah, guess I'll reconsider QRK, then.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:54:32
Oh wow, thanks for the info on that. 
So if I just want to keep money in the account and buy another day, it sounds like I should do my trading on MtGox? Then when I'm ready to cash out, sell them somewhere, such as coinbase for USD?
What's your practice?
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:03:09
Actually, I mean the RPG currency for in game. It's the "local" currency for the story. Final Fantasy has Gil, my game has BTC. Sorry about the confusion &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:14:07
Is there any reason in particular as to why? 
It's just one of the two cryptos I use, but if it's *that* hated then I'll consider just going BTC? lol
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:05:03
I think you misunderstood me. There's no actual BTC going in or out of the game. It's just the currency used in my game. The local story currency in my fictional world. No actual BTC is being exchanged. :)
More or less, the game is giving a "shout out" to real world BTC.

It's a piece of media that's uses/mentions (to a degree) it.  Not even really trying to build "hype" but just sharing my little "contribution" in one small way I can.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:26:05
OP's link.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:21:28
Okay, dumping the idea on QRK after seeing the feedback of what folks said. Wasn't really aware of the scam bullshit, and don't wanna be associated with that, so it's dumped. Maybe BTC and LTC then? :)

Also, if you are interested in beta testing the game, please message me your Steam ID!
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:24:05
Yup, I'm going to beta test in blocks of 1/3rd of the game at a time. Will be ready in January. PM me your Steam ID, I'll add you on Steam and we'll go from there, as testing will be done via Steam.

@_date: 2013-12-19 22:15:08
Yup, it's coming. I have an AppID. I'm not sure how I can show proof without breaking NDA on Steamworks stuff. Any suggestions that I can do to show you without getting myself in trouble?
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:24:58
Done deal. I can't edit the title of the post though, unfortunately. Might have to reach out to a mod. Quark was dropped.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:30:47
Added you!
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:41:13
Okay, I edited my post. Didn't realize I had to specifically mention it's not micro transactions. I just figured people would think "in game currency" as just that..  The  games currency. Especially with it being an old school RPG. Clarified. :)

I was thinking just abbreviated to BTC. Can the digital aspect to a certain degree. It can be changed into something already established/physical. It will be bitcoin, but it might be changed a little more to fit the world. There's a lot of room to make it work in creative ways, when you think about it.
