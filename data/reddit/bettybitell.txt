wHAT U said is absoutely right. As a bitcoin  practitioner， i do hope people around me can support Bitcoin, i do. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:55:12
No wonder there is such a long title..........speechless 
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:56:53
You're right. Besides all Bitcoin relations, he is a web fiction writer. The 'Super Brain Hacker' he wrote before was a hit in China. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:13:35
haha, you are a humorous guy.
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:24:45
It belongs to reddit, I see, Thanks 
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:38:18
Hongkong. Hadn't I made it clear in my article?
@_date: 2014-10-11 09:58:38
do hope it can does better 
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:32:53
Maybe the best way is let it be itself. Too many views may confuse the ordinary ones. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:49:37
Can't agree more. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:46:48
Really? I deleted  
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:20:21
If I were him,  I would think that will i able to travel all around the world and eat lots of delicious foods
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:51:48
Then why he chose to refuse the new payment method, i just couldn't understand
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:02:46
So, have u tried to buy sth from China?
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:33:06
I think u didn't look through my last related post. 
 
@_date: 2014-11-29 10:13:19
thank u very much. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:50:54
Just because it's a market. i really don't understand why so many Chinese Bitcoin players  blame the platform, and why the platform behaves so terrible.  
@_date: 2014-12-09 09:08:10
796 Exchange,,,sorry, I'll correct. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:15:33
What if I am not ?
@_date: 2014-08-26 07:03:21
Sorry about that. Because we rebuilt our website... The original link of  went to the article of 'Interview with Shenyu(God fish): 'SilverFish Scrypt ASIC Miner will be the first to deliver', but later we moved to  And now we move back to a total new version of  The articles' numbers are a bit disordered. Will try to fix it. Thanks for reminding! 
@_date: 2014-12-25 08:23:49
That's so surprising ............
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:52:32
Yes. HashRatio, btcgarden-AM-v1 and upcoming ROCKMINER are all with AM Gen3 chips. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:21:15
forgive me, haha.
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:18:12
Hi, I just wanna to ask how the "father of bitcoin" was thinking about when alone.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:22:28

@_date: 2014-12-28 05:31:15
The article is a Summary Info
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:03:00
U really help me out. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 08:56:05
It depends, Since Taiwan doesn't have a large amount of bitcoin users 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:25:29
 I  do now they may suffer a lot. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:00:49

@_date: 2014-10-24 03:50:13
GOOD QUESTION! 
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:53:49
Sorry for the poor translation. Since Rockxie wrote it originally by Chinese, all series are human translated by us. Will try to improve... to get a whole picture, you may read other chapters here:  Hope you enjoy the story. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:38:53

AWESOME. Good luck. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:12:24
They did. for their first generation product which was a success. But this time the second generation product btcgarden-AM-v1 was using Gen3 chips from ASICMINER. but technical proposal designed by themselves, as well as the miner manufacturing. Same situation with the HASHRATIO and ROCKMINER.
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:04:59
That's a good question. I think that situation is difficult to happen in China
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:54:41
Yes. People in China tend to accept Alipay, while the wise one choose Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:17:38
The details will be here, don't worry 
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:04:49

@_date: 2014-12-09 07:37:59

@_date: 2014-11-28 13:11:33
Have u found it? the accurate location, we had no idea , to tell u the truth
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:18:58
So, what he did can be thought of successful?
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:25:02
You are absolutely wrong. U didn't see that I said that's a funny joke 
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:29:23
How I wish I can help u. China has many exchanges, u can see the charts. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:24:18
Right. No one is wise enough too enough to tell u which can make u earn more. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:43:12
Maybe U can choose ignore. Or just leave here
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:05:52

@_date: 2014-12-25 03:32:28
......................What a bab comment..........I must admit that I am not a good writer, i AM A LEARNER most times. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:08:02
I’m afraid it isn't a matter of the price. It a matter of how people paly with spot. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 07:41:32
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:39:18
You mean I got a funny and not professional title?
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:03:24
so, i have to say, your point is awesome
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:45:30
Exactly. there's a big 'shovel seller' meeting in China today. see here:  
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:35:22
AS I worte today, Bitcoin technology is an open source and it belongs to all human beings. Nobody is able to influence it as he wished.
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:20:59
I did want to know some funny views. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:43:10

Never mind. I am a Chinese, and a 21-year-old girl. o, u see, I have too much to learn,anyway,  thanks for your feedback, I'll pay more attention to my writing. people in different countries do have different thinking ways, right? 
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:12:38
Luohu,haha, a good place, so many delicious foods and beayties. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:23:37
i don't think so. I just think my dream is so amzaing 
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:39:43
Totally agree. So many Chinese ask too much
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:17:38
what a good answer. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:39:49
i have only two choice, one is a link ,the other is an article. And I don't know how to add funny pictures....
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:16:24
I'm glad u see what i am talking about 
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:04:51
Exactly. To some extent, risk is opportunity. The game has just started. With more and more big investment firms and tycoons looking to get into the game, they need to figure out or create ways to get in. Pity for those green hands who lost money during the incident, but it was a profound lesson and reminder for all of us. Especially in China where regulation plays a very important role. The game is about to get more interesting.
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:15:57
The first batch is ready for delivery now. See price from ROCKMINER official website: 
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:39:26
HAHA. no his tel number
@_date: 2014-12-26 08:54:40
Agree. Why the price remains so low
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:55:52
kind of special.
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:29:00
futures leverage. So many people suffered huge loss. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:53:32
Bitcoin is not dead in China and will never be. Yes, it's currently in a very sensitive situation here. Rumor said the PBOC, the central bank of China, might take action to ban the services that banks or any third-party financial agencies offering to Bitcoin Exchanges, order banks to close Exchange's bank accounts. So if this is true, then the Chinese Exchanges will be in a very dangerous place. So far there's no official document issued. Even if the document out, Chinese Bitcoin exchanges would move overseas or offline. There's nothing to stop its development. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 08:49:21
Official website: 
But the new 768G miner hasn't been updated yet on their website. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:22:01
Yes, it abosultely from Chinese, I do admit that what I am saying not that kind of American or English, So???????? 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:23:28
The most important thing is that we should hold belief in new things. Anyway, All good things shall endure lots of hardship.  
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:21:30
Ha,,,kind of funny &gt; donuts!
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:52:36
It may account for that part partially. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:54:06
Good. I shall ask him 
@_date: 2014-10-11 09:59:08
good point 
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:08:37
i feel confused too, forgive me about my blindness, haha
