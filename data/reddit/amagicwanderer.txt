Christ, at this rate I'll be giving HJs in the alley for crack in no time

Indeed, that was the real treasure we all were looking for this whole time. Where's Nicholas Cage?

The only good thing about such a volatile market is that if it can drop more than 10% in a single day, it can also rise by that much in a day.

As a loyal member here, I have to. No eye contact tho
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:30:03
Indeed it has. So maybe it's time.

I joke around a lot, but I'm honestly not worried. I know it's going to go up by a lot again soon. And when it does, we'll all be tougher.. and yay, a bit wiser. For we have endured the Bitcoin battles

I guess I personally think that this is the start of it climbing way back up. I absolutely could be wrong. Let's just say I hope I'm not!
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:27:07
Because for me, in the grand scheme of things, I expect it to be back around 16,000 in the next couple months. If I buy in at 7, 6, 8.. I don't really care that much.

I'm one of the people on the sidelines waiting to buy once it bottoms. Bitfinex does margin trading but doesn't allow US residents like myself. Coinbase does but you have to be a bajillionaire. Amyone know of a place that allows margin trading?

Just went all in... hands off the steering wheel now
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:18:25
Wow, Bitmex is exactly what I'm looking for. Are you sure people in the United States can use it though? The last thing I want to happen is use a VPN to register, make a lot of money, then have them tell me they can't give me it because I have a US bank. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:51:45
Oh, correct... I did not. I just got it in today, sorry - now your question makes a lot of sense. It was extremely frustrating for me but oh well.
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:05:04
I feel good about this run. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:27:17
and I can't wait until you lose all your money betting on the completely wrong direction and have to watch from the sidelines :(
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:44:47
This looks like the turnaround point. We can only hope. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:58:26
Well, that's exactly why I'm grateful for this. I watched it climb and didn't have a single cent invested. I recently went all in during the dip, now I have a second chance
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:57:05
Tether. Just youtube coinbase and tether

I believe this is the start of a long bull run, and I want to margin trade on the long position to make more money. Poloniex has been "verifying" me for weeks and so has Kraken. I doubt they'll ever get their shit together. 
       I live in USA. Do I have any options or do I have to miss out?
