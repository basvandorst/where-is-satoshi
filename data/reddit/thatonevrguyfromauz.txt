That's... an awful lot of assumptions to make about this entire endeavour and it's methodology based purely on a single photo of two guys.

Simple: I came super close to my total coin value being less than what I put into it. I sold, and because of that I've made at least a bit of profit. If I had hodled, I'd have lost money. Now I didn't. What's not to understand?

Gee, I can't think of a good reason why a "Bitcoin Expert" might possibly be motivated to say that it's going to be the next big thing...

That could work! How do I convert it to Litecoin? Here in Australia, Coinbase doesn't allow me to sell coins, so I can't just sell the BTC and buy LTC.

Yikes... Yeah, I guess that's all I can do. Do we have any idea when that might happen?

This might be a noob question, but if i move my coins from Coinbase to GDAX, where can I see it? As in, where is it now, where can I see what's in my wallet on GDAX?

As someone thinking of trying out a bit of mining with my 1080/Ryzen 1700 build (not exactly up there with big farms, I know), what are some good alts that you'd recommend? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:32:26
Ah, sorry, I made a type in the title. Yes, I used GDax.com
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:33:18
That sounds like a real 'work smarter, not harder" solution. Is there a definitive guide for complete beginners that you could recommend? I'd love to get into it.

Sure, that'd be good! Ok, here goes: 
* What program do you use to mine alts, and how do you find/implement the profit switching algorithm? 
* Could you elaborate on what this means: "I ASIC mine both sha256 and scrypt on multipools"? 
* And finally, I recently saw a thread complaining about high fees when consolidation a lot of smaller inputs from mining. Since you get paid directly in bitcoin for the alts you mine, I assume that's not directly a problem. How do you get paid though? Can I have it pay the bitcoin directly to my CoinBase account? (yes, I still use CoinBase... I'm just starting out! :p ) 
Thanks for this, and don't feel like you have to go into too much detail or anything, but anything you do share will really help me out :)

So here's the deal. I tried a bit of mining with Awesome Miner and zpool, and let it run for a day. Then I checked the progress at  and saw that I had a few coin fragments under total unpaid, but nothing under paid. There is also a tiny bit under total pending, which doesn't seem to be changing. 
It's been a couple of days since then, shouldn't that have shown up in my CoinBase wallet by now?
After some googling I found one post about zpool not paying out untill you have 0.0015 btc, or something along those lines, but that would take a really long time for to accumulate, and wouldn't be worth it. Have I just lost those fragments that I did mine, because they're under the threshold?

I wish. Here in Australia, Coinbase doesn't allow me to sell coins, so I can't just sell the BTC and buy LTC.

Is that really likely though? It seems unrealistic...
