+1 for this, I've had torguard for years and never had a problem.  I've even set up port forwards and it was very easy.

VERY good news!  They can see us coming and we will not stop!!
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:33:30
I'll report big gains like if I made more than $1000 but buying little things like an item on overstock or coffee I'm not reporting.  If they really want to waste money coming after me for that, go ahead :-D 
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:51:12
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:46:34
If you want to be really safe, buy the item with bitcoin right away.  Generally, though, price swings don't happen too often and it doesn't move a horrible amount per day.

Really??  Because this is the first time I've heard of this happening and I personally know at least 5 people who have been mugged for cash...also, they would have to unlock my encrypted phone and wallet...that's not likely to happen
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:49:53
Why couldn't it be?
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:47:38
How about sponsoring an artist in artprize Grand Rapids?  Just thinking out loud, but there are literally thousands of people that come to see art from around the world.  It's not that expensive, and we could have the person make some type of bitcoin art of some type (I'm not an artist, so I have no idea how this could work).  Any thoughts?
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:22:44
Well, they haven't oficially said anything regarding Bitcoin specifically...
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:55:59
Isn't the point of an open transactional system to be able to be used by everybody?  I don't like the idea of being able to just decide to "kill" the coins.  I would LOVE to be able to spit in the face of the US government like that, but it's open...you have to protect the rights of EVERYBODY...even theives like that...

This whole article is a joke: "Forget about bitcoin as a currency for a second[...]" in the response to that section: "Dear A.P. I thought about it. Bitcoin is a joke perpetuated on a gullible **investing** public. Sorry you disagree. I hope you keep reading me." Wow...maybe this guy should do a little less writing and a little more reading...
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:44:32
Don't forget that this is the "Relayed by" coloumn.  It's not necessarily the pool (or single miner i guess) that found it.  I got in trouble thinking this same thing.
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:29:35
oh, shit...
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:34:58
The thing is that bitcoin is simply not meant to be a monetary investment.  Its meant to be used for people for instantaneous transfers of value.
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:40:51
sweet!!  This website is awesome

I put a QR code of my wallet in the window of my dorm and somebody sent me a little tiny bit of coin :P.  They would probably frown on me running a moderately sized mining operation in there, if they found out though :D

I'm from Michigan!!  My dad has a photo booth business that will probably accept bitcoin in the near future...but yes...its true...we don't really have very many places that accept bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:09:48
It is harder to steal bitcoins, though.
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:20:41
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:47:08
Completely agree.  If bitcoin is to be a sucessful way to transact money, we need to prove to the world that our system is stable enough to be used on a much higher level.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:57:06


Nice!  Thanks for that!
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:29:47


He's not comparing the same metric here.  The 3% that he's referring to with Visa is a **fee**.  If you want to compare this metric between Visa and Bitcoin, you use the .0001 BTC **fee** that the network charges.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:06:21
would you rather have to be careful and use escrow or have somebody have all of your information and be able to charge you whatever they want whenever they want?  
Basically giving them your key pair and saying "Oh, take whatever your product costs" is what happens with credit cards...
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:38:22
Haha...same situation for me...also Michigan
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:02:26
No.  I didn't even know it was there!
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:31:30
It isn't, but there is no upstream communication.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:52:20
Congratulations and welcome to the community!
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:59:57
You can look at the [blockchain.info Stats page]( there is a metric called Total Transaction Volume.  This is for the past 24 hours, but it is all transactions on the network for the past 24 hours.
You might be able to find better statistics from overstock or someone that has actually done goods transactions in Bitcoin, but I'm not sure where those statistics would be.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:22:57
Yes, but the satellites are not geostationary, so the communication device will have to track satellites across the sky.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:55:04
Love this idea!  I'm in college and I would buy and sell books on here!  Make sure you advertise so there is a selection.

Well, define wasted.  Do you count gaining knowledge as wasted?  I would like to say even if I lost everything I have invested, I still come out with a LOT of knowledge.
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:37:27
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:36:24
For places I trust, I don't use escrow, so that's just the bitcoin transaction fee for those.  Otherwise escrow and multisig are even still cheaper than credit card fees.
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:25:31
That looks like a great site!  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:50:45
And that is the right question.  Sadly, it's not the people that have the power any more.  It's the compaines that hire lobbyists that control the government.

Phishing site...Report it to Google.
There are very few legit sites out there now that do not use Https://
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:41:01
I would say this is for a different reason.  Port 8333 is used pretty much exclusively by bitcoin core and, since there's not really a monetary reason to block that port (since ports 80 and 8080 are commonly used by servers for hosting web content), I believe it would count as censorship.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:23:42
Welcome to the rabbit hole!  Seriously...I didn't go to class for about 3 days when I was learning about Bitcoin in 2012.  Pretty sweet stuff in here.

It (generally) doesn't cost any money to open an account on an exchange, the profits for them are transaction based, and generally negligable.

This is my favorite answer so far.  Here's 500 bits @_date: 2015-02-26 19:43:57
In Michigan, the only reason we actually have machines (kind of like this) is because they're required by the state if you sell anything that has a deposit on it.  I could see this helping adoption of a bottle deposit if people are actually willing to use bitcoin.

Lenovo Z400 touch and my custom built desktop.  Everything worked "out of the box".  The laptop has the OEM wifi card and the desktop has onnboard wired networking and an intel laptop cardin a pcie adapter.  Everything works perfectly.
