People speculate it is because of the Chinese new year.

Please tell me what countries are actively working towards making Bitcoin (or any crypto) their *functional* currency.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:44:06
22% in electronics. 22% in jewelery. How foolish can someone be if they think all of the gold in the world is barely used in these applications? Of course the primary uses for gold are in these industries. It's common sense. (
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:19:11
You're delusional if you think a digital commodity will be adopted by countries as their functional currency.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:40:15
Except gold is a physical commodity with applications in many things like electronics. It is tangible and used across a large array of things. (I'm not anti-btc. I'm holding a good amount of btc that is probably more than the average person. People just need to be realistic in terms of the future of bitcoin)
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:46:26
False. A large portion of the gold supply is used towards electronics and jewelery. ( That's not a negligible amount.  
Yes, it is driven by speculation but there's actual uses and demand for gold. It was used in history as a currency before. It is a finite resource which makes it still have relative value.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:39:14
If you think 34% in industry and 38% use in jewelery is a "very small percentage" then sure ( People are out of their mind if they think a digital commodity would overtake the value of a physical one that has many uses. I am confidently holding bitcoin so I'm not anti-btc... But people need to be realistic though.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:37:06
Eerrm... How so?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:25:10
Hmm... It's almost as if... Technology advances over time?! /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:51
My two cents - I'd sell!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:10
One thing that is different than in the past history of BTC is the amount of growth we've seen in just the last 24hrs/couple days. It never has grown this much this quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:29:08
Mhm... Car enthusiasts may want it if it's their taste? Alfa is a luxury brand so there's a desirable market out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:08:20
Very true - don't forget to take gains.  
Good question is brought up on this thread though... How did you cash out? What did you use to sell it and deposit the money to your bank?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:33:41
That is certainly true, if you bought BTC at a high point in this past year 2017, you would have done fine. However, it's basic investment knowledge to never buy high. That's at the highest risk possible to buy. All investments require risk but people have no reason to buy it at its highest point when it'll result in smaller returns! It will drop. There's always an ebb and flow. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:55:46
Buy and hold, baby.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:20:31
Let's not forget the practicality side though, of PayPal. PayPal transactions are instant and you get the money right away. BTC transactions can take hours depending on the confirmation amount. Good for BTC for overtaking the market cap though, it's monumental!
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:52:11
That's why Coinbase exists! They host your wallet for you. They're the PayPal for BTC I guess, in a rough sense.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:06:59
Sure, but if BTC is meant to be universal and used by all people, there's no practicality of using BTC for day-to-day transactions with a fee like that (and let's not forget the slow confirmation times). The average person probably won't be transacting anything close to that much daily. That scaling argument is only applicable for banks or large companies that would move money frequently.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:39:10
It's never a good idea to buy a crypto when it is at its highest (if you're looking to invest). Wait for it to drop!
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:02:13
I'm sure you can find someone to crack it. You aren't a complete lost cause!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:39:54
I don't have much of an opinion on hard forks but I know it confuses the crap out of people wanting to invest into BTC.
"So there's Bitcoin and there's also Bitcoin cash"...
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:49:19
It's unnecessary. Why would a normal daily transaction, like buying some food, need to be verified so many times? It is simply superfluous. It makes sense for transactions consisting of large amounts of money to be confirmed numerous times, but not some $2 BTC transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:57:24
I honestly hate these types of threads. There are plenty of other ways to send money that are near instant.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:51:46
I see this re-posted every month and I couldn't care less every time I see it...
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:14:35
I'm a huge advocate and investor in cryptos. BTC isn't really practical for everyday use. There was a post earlier in this sub that had a really good quote:
"Even with 0 fees, clearing your coffee payment through the entire planet is lame. But securing your life savings for $5 is a steal."
PayPal, Venmo, and a bunch of other options exists at the moment and work great for person-to-person transactions. Everyone knows that WU sucks.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:44:44
That quote is so true and well said.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:50:29
They aren't the same thing. /stupid post
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:53:34
This is so stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:47:37
hates any thread with the word "crypto" in it, I swear.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:01:42
Well, the argument of BTC being faster is out the window then. Escrows take much longer in terms of processing transactions if you're a seller. Transactions should go through fast both ways. When I want to sell something on eBay, I get the buyer's money instantly.
Some people want to be frugal and don't want to waste unnecessary money on fees just for a transaction to go faster. Even 1 confirmation can take a good amount of time occasionally. It should just be fast to start (many altcoins remedy this slow transaction speed).
Long story short - cryptos are great, I advocate and invest in them, but they are not comparable to current systems (PayPal, Visa/Mastercard,etc) and are not ready to be used for the masses. If I can't see my own parents use BTC and all everyday, it's not fully publicly accessible. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:20:48
Exactly! I can at least admit as a Uni student who took two econ courses that I recently understood it all. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:45:29
OP doesn't know a single thing about economics.
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:37:03
Old news. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:37:48
This story is completely irrelevant to cryptos (not that I'm not happy for you, I'm glad your issue is fixed). Yeah, you're your own bank with BTC if you have a wallet and all, but you don't get insurance and other benefits if something happens to your paper wallet. People are thinking way too far into the future.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:44:20
Old fucking news man. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:36:07
Correlation does not imply causation. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:28:03
Craigslist isn't a payment processor. It is up to the lister to decide what form of payment they want, like cash, cashier's check, BTC, etc., from a customer. This is a meaningless and pointless post.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:00:09
"Buyer's protection" is meh for BTC. For plain person-to-person transactions, there is a very high risk of losing your money. And transaction times can take hours or longer depending on the confirmation amounts. BTC is nice and all, and it may be the future, but it's not ready *now*. Anyways, most people would get a BTC debit card like Shift for Coinbase for the convenience. So a lot of the "disadvantages" in this chart for mastercards will still linger. Edit: Let me mention that I advocate all cryptocurrencies. I own many altcoins and BTC. But they aren't ready *yet* for the masses for normal transactions.
