Yeah, but that didn’t happen did it.

Well to a certain extent the realities of today were shaped by that generation, and are now controlled by a select few billionaires of that generation. It’s not exactly a new sentiment either

Lol ok pal

I’m offended that the trivial tag a trivialised generation has created in return is trivially offending an older generation. Circle of life my dude, get over it or die trying.

Hey so I’m getting an inheritance soonish, I’m planning on sinking a little of it into owning one full bitcoin. 
Problem is, I find it really hard to learn how to safely own one, and have a hard wallet? I currently own close to 6% of a btc but i don’t think I have the keys, just online. And I don’t really want to trust my btc to some online trade platform.
Any recommendations for a YouTube learning channel? And maybe a good wallet? This all makes me feel stupid, but I’m convinced anybody that misses out in the next couple years will firmly regret it.

Idk sounds kinda gay.

This feels like the stupidest twilight zone.

Sounds like okcoin paid zhao the 20k bounty to take the fall for them.

If the cost of something bounces around with the volatility of bitcoin then sure that's going to work. With real currency you don't have that issue.

Sounds like communism!

Well it hasn't come back for nearly a year now. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:11:23
12 bucks worth. Itll be like a million bucks soon, right? Right?

Like, her fingers? That's dark man.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:05:11
Lol are you me?
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:43:58
That's why he owns bitcoin.
