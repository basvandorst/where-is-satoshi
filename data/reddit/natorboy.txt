You're living in a bubble dude... There are a ton of nodes in support of XT. You just don't have access to the right information here...
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:12:31
Yeah we can also let bitcoin die at 1MB blocksize.

XT and BIP 101 are not altcoin though and even if, what's wrong about pointing out things those are doing better?
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:29:02
What does it matter if it's content is 10 times better?
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:26:17
Yeah there are a lot of people letting steam off at right now, but once you get past those, there is a lot of informative content and actual discussion there!
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:58:47
For example?
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:32:26
It's called being creative. /s
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:16:48
And Germany.
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:55:34
Yeah but the controversial content here is getting censored...

coinbase is working for me

And drugs.

If somebody killed himself with a product purchased on amazon, should the CEO of amazon get life in prison?

Hey I have the same thing running a plex server. I only have 1mbit/s upload speed. Would it still be good enough for a full node?
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:19:33
Yeah it works for me too, even though support told me it won't.
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:39:55
That didn't work out too well now, did it?
