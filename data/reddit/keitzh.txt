Living in EU, in a country where we have excellent tax laws for companys. Have only bought btc for my company in last 5 years (i registered it for only buying and holding crypto), so all the crypto i have is on my companys balance sheet. When i want to sell i can do it whenever i like and i wont pay any tax at all. I can sell btc and buy real estate, stocks, etfs, bonds, cars etc. for my company and not pay any tax. I will only pay taxes when i want to withdraw the profit from my company (20%).

About 10 months to halvening to be precise...

1. Add up all btc you have bought
2. Add up all fiat you have bought with
3. Divide the fiat sum with btc sum
Little bit easier for you

When i checked their site it showed that their cards are Mastercard, or are they VISA?

Half a trillion dollar market cap would mean one coin should be worth around 30k usd

You don´t get the point, once you have declared your old passport stolen/lost you can not be held responsible for illegal things done with said passport.
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:45:41
I advise everyone to have 1 passport that is not valid but can be used for any verification procedure. Just declare your current passport missing/stolen and get a new one. Use the old passport for whatever verification you need to.

If you want to hide your identity that is another topic. Using not a valid document just insures that when there is a data leak or criminals get their hands on your id scans they can not do any harm with it.

About 20-25% more efficient than S9s

I'm thinking bottom will be when we see difficuly decreasing for the first time. I added about 15% to my long term holding stack at 6700 (bought 2 previous dips at 5950 and 6450 too)

What are you talking about?
like 12 sat/byte to get into next block atm

Can someone explain to me, how for example with a Breez lightning wallet, i can receive payments without loading up btc from mainnet? Other lightning implementations i have tried always require me to load with btc before i can use them.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:04:40
I hope next bullrun will not start before the halvening, at the moment there is very little free space in blocks so we would most definently have a clogged up mempool again if bullmarket started soon. I'm hoping that by second half of 2020 lightning network has developed enough that most of the big exchanges are using it and  it is easy enough for average user to use it aswell.

Excellent visual form, we need one of those every month so people who are not so familiar with tech can understand what is going on aswell.

What you are saying is that bitcoin has really good risk/reward ratio. 
Lets say its 50% chance it will be worth nothing in 5 years and 50% chance of being worth lets say 100k.  So if you buy 1 btc now you lose 6300 usd or gain 93700 usd within 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:56:15
These % were an example, i´m just saying that I see a good risk/reward ratio at current price, you do not have to agree with me. 
I have been in crypto from 2013 and have achieved my financial freedom from it already but am still holding about 50% of my NW in crypto (usually rebalancing monthly). 
 The best principle that has helped me in crypto tremendously comes from Benjamin Graham - " The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism and unjustified pessimism. The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists."
I saw the unsustainable optimism in December, 2013 and December, 2017. I also saw unjustified pessimism in 2015 (my average buy in price for BTC is around 270$). I´m starting to see this pessimism again when guys like you are creeping around and calling everyone kids and morons.

have used bitstamp for my small transactions for years now and never paid any fees (even when avg fee was 35 usd) 
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:41:03
It will, this is because block halvening only happens after every 210000 blocks. So there will be time, when it hits 21.000.000 coins before it can halven and make the reward smaller. Should happen in about 120 years.

Fees will not increase, volume will. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:35:52
Point is, that miners will not operate with a loss for a long period of time when almost all of the coins are mined. So in the end if  volume will not increase it will just mean less miners, so more fees per 1 miner or machine.  Dont forget that all aspects of btc are self-automated.
