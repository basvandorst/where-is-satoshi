Manually copy the source code and build it yourself... JK, but seriously, having internet connection before is somewhat fine. If you're paranoid, just generate your master private keys with dices, use it on different wallets, and never expose it to the internet. It is a single time process that takes 1 or 2 minutes and safeguards you against many things, including every possible source of malware, and accidental bad usage of the PRNG which can screw you up hard and punk.
@_date: 2016-08-27 13:55:24
Before too, what if a malware causes it to generate unsafe private keys?

When you open a payment channel, you lock your BTC in a way that it can only be sent to a single recipient. That way, your signature is enough to confirm you didn't double spend, because you literally can't send that money to anyone else!

I think he is mistaken though, afaik the real advantage of horizontal scaling is that there is no limit to it, you can keep buying more and more computers, whereas with vertical scaling, you can't just buy an Intel that is 2x faster. So making a system that scales horizontally means you can handle as many users as you have by just buying more servers, whereas a system that only scales vertically might reach a point where you can't handle new users and start losing profits.

Exactly. Also, how do you define inside trading on the context of crypto-currencies? There is no "Bitcoin insider", everything that happens with BTC is public. CoinBase does not own Bitcoin. I wonder, for example, if I have a large gold store, I can't legally trade on usd/gold pairs? If any lawyer around knows that info I'd be highly appreciative for it.

For me, that is the only valid way of explaining bitcoin. 
*"What is bitcoin?"*
*"It is a way to send money quickly and safely to anyone in the world over the internet."*
*"Why not just make a bank transfer?"*
*"In many cases it is impossible, or takes a lot of time."*
*"Why not just use a credit card?"*
*"You can't use it to send money to another individual (that is not a company)."*
*"Why not just use Paypal / something similar?"*
*(Cites any of the countless Paypal drama cases.)*
When he is out of options... *"see, that's what's Bitcoins are for".*
If, and only if, he asks how... then, yes, you hold your erection, ask him to take a seat and start rambling about the blockchain for how long he endures.

That's where your risk comes in. If by March we have consensus on the block size debate, then by January something some will already have 99% certainty that will happen and the price will reflect on the market before you do. The price always rises before the good news.

Honestly, I prefer it to be just a neutral, informative ad.

The backend is mostly in Haskell, the frontend is JavaScript using WebGL, but I can easily interop with anything else if you are thinking in a particular library. Although I guess I'd prefer the resources/techniques to implement it myself, considering the nature of the matter.
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:50:32
Looks like you are confused about what a bitcoin is. You don't have a "private key" for a bitcoin, you have a private key for a "bitcoin address". The "bitcoin address" is logically the same as a bank account. The private key is logically the same as the password for your bank account. Except it is actually stored on the network, not in a bank's server. Also, there is no such a thing as a "whole bitcoin". You can, yes, buy 1 bitcoin, but nothing is stopping you from buying any fraction of that. Bitcoins are real numbers, not integers.
The easier way to get a bitcoin is registering on a market such as Coinbase and buying it there. Then, you must create a "bitcoin address" for you. That is what a wallet (software that you download) is for. It creates that address and communicates the network. Then you just, from Coinbase's site, transfer that money to the address that will appear on the wallet. If you want, you can now just write down your private key on a paper and completely delete anything about bitcoin from your computer. The money will always be yours, as soon as you don't lose that piece of paper. Electrum (an wallet) has a nice paper wallet feature - it allows you to write a phrase you can actually memorize.

I, like many, use Wikipedia several times a day and it is one of my main sources of information. I see it as at least an obligation to donate some money periodically and I'd happily do that if I could. Except that, as someone who doesn't own a credit card, the process of transferring money online is so painful that I don't have the patience or time to bother. I don't buy anything online and it is never about the money, but the process. Having a bitcoin option would ensure my contribution and of many others in a similar situation.

I don't think it is complete enough. Of course, it has everything involving bitcoin, but it assumes previous knowledge in topics such as cryptography.

Hell, fuck off. JavaScript has no integers, if that is what you want to know. Its numbers are just doubles, and that's what you can work with. Doubles are precise enough to store all possible amounts of satoshis. If they were not, an option would be simply using arrays of those doubles. Or using bitwise operations, being aware those are only precise to 32 bits. Or whatever the fuck you wanted. The program is yours, you do the shit you want. And there is no way to make type synonyms in JS like you can in C. You can create an object, but to box numbers that would be ridiculously inefficient. Now go read a fucking book instead of begging people to answer your fucking questions. Nobody here is being paid to help you.

I'm working on that. Personally, if I ever have the option to use bitcoin for something I buy, I do. And that includes using it even when the option isn't directly available - ex, using gyft.com to buy things on amazon. Professionally, I'm developing a MMO which will use bitcoins directly on its internal currency, so people using it will be introduced and probably like bitcoin a lot. After all, people like games and winning actual money from being the champion in a game tournament must feel really good.

That is the point you aren't seeing, the Bitcoin network already performs about 2^64 attempts per second. If it keeps doubling the hashrate 4 times a year, by 2033 it will be performing 2^128 every single second. By 2025 it will be more profitable to just usa that power to crack private keys. 
This just shows that the hashrate explosion will soon stagnate. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:43:01
Time it takes to crack all Bitcoin private keys with that computing power, divided by the total bitcoin supply, gives you how many seconds the network would need to provide a single bitcoin if the miners switched their machines to private key cracking. If that is more than the mining reward then it is more profitable to sell your SHA3 asics and build bitcoin address generators. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:27:50
No relationship. See, if it takes X seconds to crack **all** addresses, and there are Y bitcoins in circulation, then by going full crack more, you're "stealing" Y/X bitcoins per second in averag.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:31:41
Still not a lot. Paypal does at least 10 times that IIRC.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:12:41
Because that's the amount of Bitcoin you can steal after cracking all addresses...
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:03:57
I'm not sure private keys will be broken like that, that might require more computing power than this universe can achieve. What this table means for me is that, in the next decades, the hashrate will just stagnate. Otherwise I'll be really worried, not for Bitcoin but for humanity as a whole.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:52:19
That is an awesome answer that deserves more upvotes than I could give. But for sake of completeness, imagine someone asked how computer programs are created, and we tell them:
*"Well, you have to find a good team, a good debugger and a good compiler, which must perform optimizations such as common subexpression elimination, balanced inlining and STC (static type checking). When creating it, don't forget proper etiquette, good indentation and descriptive comments. Use a version control such as GIT and don't forget to commit often and avoid unnecessary branchings. Write a lot of tests to avoid bugs. Then don't forget about the security certificates and having a solid software license."*
What I mean is, yea... that kinda answers the question, but I still have no idea what the thing actually is. It is not very introductory, to say. Using the programming example, something around *"computer programs are usually created using something called programming langauges. Programming languages convert human-readable code to instructions that are processed by the computer, giving birth to programs and applications you see. To get started in programming, a good idea is to find tutorials for a popular programming language. To get a grasp of how things work, a good idea is downloading simple applications and looking at their source codes in a site such as github.com."* - would do a much better work at introducing the area. I guess it is my fault, though, I must ask more specific questions:
- Is there a programming language designed for ASICs? What is it / what are them called?
- Is there any open-source, minimal ASIC design one could explore?
- How would an "Hello World" ASIC look like? 
- How does an ASIC relate to what I know about FGPA's? Is knowledge from programming FGPA's anything related to ASICs at all?

If you are asking if it is computationally intensive, not at all. Computers can sum billions of numbers per second nowadays. You probably could compute the balance of every single address a thousand times in no time in a old computer. It is not difficult to implement, too.

I'm pretty sure you need only 2^128 attempt to crack any private key. In any case, by about 250 or so we would be doing 2^256 keys per second anyway. The point is: the hashrate can't keep doubling every 75 days forever.

You don't get it. Bitcoin is just money. Like fiat, but with better properties. Most making the switch don't recognize fiat as real money (it is just printable paper!) and don't plan to "sell" at all.

Seriously, thank you for the transparency. Now, personally, if you are considering changing it again, please go for the guy who said:
    "Send money anywhere in the world for free."
That's the first thing that must be said - no more no less. You either have a great design that makes people want to read further, or at least pass the message before they run away. The current design makes they run away without knowing what Bitcoin is. 
IMO the site should look more serious, more like an humanity heritage. Like Wikipedia. Not like a startup trying to make money. Don't try to sell it. Dollar doesn't try to sell itself. It is money. Just don't. State what is it unenthusiastically, have direct links to the technological overviews and how to use. That is indeed the 2 main things the site needs, the biggest links: technical overview / how to use. It is a complete mistake to try to hide the tech parts. Yes, common people will not read it - but they **want** it to be there. They will click it, show it to their friends and say: "see, that is smart stuff". It makes the site credible.

Seriously, Bitcoin community? Are you seriously voting this shit up?
Honestly, what is wrong with you? I think you may not have noticed, but we don't spend our times attacking on In fact, I challenge you to find a single thread saying anything bad about Bitcoin, at all. We've been for years being friendly, expecting to build a peaceful community where crypto enthusiasts collaborate together to the same goals. There, we research, we write code all day long, we have ideas and talk about them. And, as we do our stuff, we try to be as friendly as possible with neighboring communities. 
Z-cash, Monero, we're easily friends with those guys. We're all in the same boat, we all share the same enemies, so doesn't that kinda make us friend? But no, there is No matter how much we try, you keep attacking us. We even fucking helped you with the Ethereum Classic bullshit (which suddenly made you all love Ethereum, but everyone knows it was just your "Ethereum hate fest") by building a proper replay protection. We did it for you, for peace. For Satoshi's sake, even our "welcome to Ethereum" tutorial has a very large note on how awesome Bitcoin is, how grateful we are for it. Most of us love Bitcoin as much as you do.
**So why do you keep attacking us?** 
If you can't be friendly, why don't you just mind your own business, fix your shit up?
*"Vitalik admits that turing complete smart contracts were just a way to separate newbs from their Bitcoin"* is that, deeply honestly, how you interpret that comment?

~~Can I ask you a question? I know  uses `bitcoinjs-lib`, which I found very well written and decided to use. The only thing I couldn't find is how to generate a private key (`ETCPair` object) from a 256-bit hex string. There is `ECPair.makeRandom()` (I don't trust it) and `ECPair.fromWIF()` (but no PvtKey-&gt;WIF function). I've been digging the source and it seems like I need `BigInteger.fromHex` from the `bigi` library, or what? Do you know the answer?~~

Well, it is a fact of nature that centralization is more efficient. Decentralization only makes sense when different parts of a system don't trust each other. I'd say the world I want to live in is one where somehow the specie achieves such a level of shared trust, that centralization isn't a problem. Now, since that is almost impossible, the second best option is a system where centralization can't be a problem.

Ok, but how are you anchoring proofs on the Blockchain without a programming language? As a simple example, suppose you want to make a bet against Alice about a future event (using an oracle as the judge, for simplicity). Eventually you have the result of the event, and the proof you won is a signature from the oracle... now, how do you convince the blockchain to make a transaction from Alice to your address using that proof without a programming language?
@_date: 2016-10-05 23:32:54
As I understand it, that is not a lightning network. He just accumulates micro-transactions on his centralized server and broadcasts to the blockchain when it is big enough. That way, you don't have to bloat the blockchain with micro-transactions, and the central party can only do small harm.
It actually looks a very solid idea to me. I mean, this does all that the lightning network does, except trading a small decrease in security for a ridiculous boost in performance, scalability and simplicity. Just think about it; the worst thing that the central party (Kim) could do is go evil and steal like .1 BTC from everyone, once, and then get sued the hell out. 
A centralized processor for micro transactions + blockchain confirmation after a volume threshold looks like a perfect solution to the micro transactions problem. I'd like an expert to comment on that one.
@_date: 2016-10-05 22:27:31
How would that happen? As far as I understand, Ethereum contracts are developed once, deployed and that is it, no more messing with the code after that.
@_date: 2016-10-06 00:36:18

@_date: 2015-11-03 09:59:49

Regardless of what you do, it doesn't change what you **did** and what **can do**. As a Bitcoin user, I'd not support (and, thus, give it some sort of representative power) a foundation that could overnight turn evil. I just think bitcoin enables an organization much less representative and much more participative than what a conventional "foundation" has to offer. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:13:32
But you can remove it. Make an auction with a life contract you'd buy all bitcoins for X dollars, and we can then be sure BTC will never fall below X/21kk cents! 
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:49:59
That is misinformed. Solidity is compiled to an assembly-like machine language, which is what is stored on the blockchain. A change in Solidity doesn't affect existing contracts at all.

I just want to point out that functional programming languages are massively parallelizable by using interaction nets, which is a new model of computation that reduces lambda terms algorithmically optimally and has been shown to scale to multiple cores with ideal speedup. It is something very new and somewhat unknown but it might be the easier answer to the issue you raised at this point.

But everyone knows that is stupid and even Vitalik admits it. What I don't understand is what you're proposing instead. We need a solution to decentralized contracts, right? On Ethereum's case, the proposal that will supposedly be implemented soon is splitting the blockchain into smaller groups so that only a constant number of people validate your contract (thus the network scales linearly not quadratically). Just enough validators to give us the "contracts without trusting a centralized party" thing we need, no more than the necessary. That looks on point to me, no?

That is not how it works. FYI behind the price there are tons of very rich manipulation groups waiting for the right moment to promote a pump. They're powerful but not infinitely. The halvening, due to the very nature of the event ("nobody knows what can happen, but something might"), is a window which can be used to promote such movement, and that is because people will be willing to buy Bitcoin when the price increases near the halving because of their self justifications of "this is because of the halving". It is all about psychology of the masses, but saying if the price goes to $800 it has nothing to do with the halving is wrong. It is all about the halving right now.

This is because the only reason some strategies work is that they provide an information advantage - i.e., they will predict the future better than everyone else. When they become known, it is not an information advantage anymore, so they stop working by design.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:21:59
It is not that someone in particular makes that assumption. It is the average sentiment of the whole network reflected in the price. The fact those coins never moved in 7 years makes it very likely that they won't move in the next years. The market prices that expectative - that is just how it works. If a coin moves, the analysis flips upside down and so does the market.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:18:22
Not sure if I can post this here (feel free to delete otherwise), but we've been developing a proof language (i.e., one capable of formally verifying its own programs through its type system) with the goal of doing a few things that are important for crypto and other proof languages don't, such as:
1. Being minimalistic (the whole thing is 1k lines, making it, differently from Agda/Coq/etc., easy to implement independently without having to "trust our code base");
2. Being optimal (in a technical sense, making it an inherently fast and efficient language, like C);
3. Parallel (so you can run general programs on the GPU, for example!).
We're making Formality because those and other things are very important for crypto for a variety of reasons, and are non-goals of existing proof languages like Agda and Coq. There are many cool things going on. Note it is still very new and not really usable yet (the core language is still too complex for normal devs), but it is progressing quite fast. [Here]( is an introduction.

That is why I hope I could sell it on the first sign of a crash. There are 2 things I'm certain: that bitcoin's value will still increase a lot in the next years, and that the way to there is a very serelepe rollercoaster.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:27:31
That is awesome, sir. Glad I gave you a chance to show that. Have my karma!
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:00:53
Exactly, that is my theory and I can't see how it won't happen other than something better replacing bitcoin.

Pardon I don't understand your vocabulary but I'm not american if that makes you happier?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:37:11
If it ever touches 90 again I'm selling my house for bitcoins, haha. 
Some people dream too high (:

May I ask what you mean with "the code"? Of what? A particular implementation of a wallet or something? (Genuinely asking)
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:29:45
Fixed, thanks.

Next time you doubt of bitcoin, just stop a second and think: do you really think we will be using the same old, bank-based monetary system in 10 years? After all that stress? After the idea being spread? No, just no. If you can't understand how that is absolutely obvious, just don't buy bitcoin, you will mess things up for yourself when its value go down and ruin the life of your sister or something like that stupid guy other day. Just wait, it will be okay!
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:02:20
:/ that sucks. Says something about our current monetary system, though. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:41:36
200? Where are you seeing that?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:30:56
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:14:41
Yes, my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:31:50
You can't speak in name of everyone. And be that the case, it is fortunate nobody has to, right?
I can't find your comment.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:20:42
Yep how do I panic sell. (:
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:28:10
Note: I tried to register three fucking times and we tried to withdraw the coins at least a dozen.

Increasing several days consecutively + 1 entire day without increasing = people who just joined for the money and don't care about BTC will get out to get his dollars or whatever. Seems simple.
I guess the buy pressure is too high for it to fall considerably, though. Seems like too many people around the world are willing to buy it for 900~1000.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:43:35
No! :/
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:35:41
I see! Thank you!
Always a pleasure to help! (:

Brazil, why?
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:37:40
Strange, I heard they were the best.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:34:42
I don't think it is as simple like that, the system is broken, it doesn't matter who you vote, the outcome is similar and bad. The only fix to that is cutting bigger trees from inner roots.
    lal thanks I guess
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:12:23
I but what I want to but.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:30:49
Yea, 16 days ago I didn't know what it was mostly about. Then I studied. And 6 days ago **I correctly predicted a huge crash that happened a few hours after!!!**
WTF are you complaining about?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:18:54
Exactly what I expect! Not like it will crash to 200 or stuff, but 1200 is insane. Too many blind fanboys here, though.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:33:32
It can and will, that is not the point. BTC is a monetary system superior to others in existence and that is why I'm using it and I'll continue supporting and using it. And that is why it will mostly likely win.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:31:33
I don't think any of those are superior to their alternatives in every relevant aspect.
