BTCPay 
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:26:51
try reading about BTCPay and how it gives more control for the merchant. also it supports Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:33:55
forgive me, but i'll just keep my seed analog for security purposes.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:31:00

That interview was done last Dec 1, a full month ago. Pre, that's stale news unless they actually did something new.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:25:11
Based on the dev's interview in Bitcoinist, it's backwards compatible with BitPay API. (
So if people using merchants on BitPay would try to convince them to migrate to BTCPay, that would help.
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:32:32
so you put in your seed at someone else's website? that's secure?

looks like a lot of XBTUSD short positions got margin called.

Many people use the chain and when people over pay to make sure their transaction gets included quickly, it creates a domino effect raising the transaction fees higher and higher.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:34:16
You are probably seeing the sell price equivalent of what you bought. Depending on the exchange/service you used, they could also have padded the buy price with other fees making the spread between buy and sell prices farther.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:27:42
As long as blockchain.info recognizes your Segwit address as a valid Bitcoin address, you have nothing to worry about.

We ought to be the ones driving the price, not them driving the price. They are betting on our buying and selling. 
Instead of us looking at their price to trigger our activities, we should be teaching them them that if they short bitcoin, they get rekt!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:48
Feels like we shouldn't let them "paper" bitcoins dictate the price. It's us holding the bitcoins that should. 
Don't let fiat holders take the value of your bitcoins!!! *red faced foaming at the mouth screaming* (LOL)

Would be fun to see the same thing as last year's post-Christmas run. Although, that one did drop to Nov '16 levels.

I remember telling someone a few weeks ago how 10% fluctuations is normal, only now 10% is 1k+ 
Also we’re up 80%+ from start of December. I look at the price daily and think it’s so crazy.

It would take a year or more to recoup in cloud mining (in usd). Better buy bitcoins at a good entry point than try cloud mining.
To answer your question though, Hashflare accept card payments
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:59:46
Basically they're stuck with their bitcoins in the exchange. almost everyone will tell you not to keep your bitcoins at an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 09:06:53
LOL computer and decent video card

I understand. I was curious with how the exchange rate would affect gains. I don't swap btc and ltc often enough to know how it's priced in. But personally I choose btc for hodling, ltc for purchases. It's like btc is my time deposit and ltc my daily wallet/atm hahaha
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:22:26
It depends on what he's after though. If he's not looking to profit with btc prices instead choosing to move his cryptocoins quickly and cheaper, then it's an understandable choice.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:39:54
It's like each transaction in the wallet is a $1 bill as opposed to a $100 bill. It counts per bill, not just the full amount.
That's why people don't really recommend faucets coz it fills your wallet with "dust" that'll increase transaction fee once you move them.
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:10:24
What about exchange rate priced in? Or are you planning to keep your assets in Litecoin?
Edit: I use Litecoin too and agree with the low fee (and faster confirmation), but it's realistic to see the other things factored in. LTCUSD is stable but BTCUSD has been on the rise.

You're talking like the governments telling people they can't take their money out of the country. 
I say diversify your holdings as you see fit.

Your wife should divorce you. How dare you use someone else's money for high risk investment?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:39:37
I only invested a little (&lt;$30) and broke even in 6 months but only because bitcoin price increased a lot and litecoin blew up (scrypt mining). 
But had I bought bitcoin and hodl, I'd have gained instead of breaking even.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:13:03
Before investing, read up as much as you can about what it was, what it is, what it is attempting to become. Read up on what affected its price and what could affect it in the future. Don't just throw your cash in with the possibility of getting rich.

You can choose the fees on coins.ph before sending. You didn't look before you clicked. Sorry. Learn from it.

A volunteer and unpaid dev takes a holiday and you get pissed? Wow, how noble of you.

If they hadn't been blocking segwit, the next dev't phase would've begun earlier.

You have not lost anything unless you sell. Step back, forget about your coins, come back in a few months.

Now. 
But if you're not comfortable with that, buy a portion now then buy a few more thru dollar cost averaging.
No one can tell you for certain how low it'll go and when.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:10:23
I would recommend a once a week purchase over a bi-weekly one. It will allow you to average better.
As for the day to purchase, it appears that Sunday US morning is a good regular buy point.
