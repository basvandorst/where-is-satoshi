I'm more interested in links to the former articles you've been reading on trading companies using twitter to predict stock price moves.
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:35:15
Yep, what's up?
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:33:46
I haven't yet but I have purchased a membership, planning on using it when the platform launches.
@_date: 2011-05-25 05:06:09
Spreaded :)
@_date: 2011-06-02 18:53:08
aahhahah.... Yes &amp; (touche)
@_date: 2011-06-01 22:41:55
Though these aren't servers; they're domain names.

Cool! I've a very similar setup; I've been split testing my gpu's for a while, and it seems that in the longterm, slush vs. deepbit does not matter at all, but deepbit definitely has a lot of short-term variance if you're doing proportional.
@_date: 2011-05-30 22:14:24
Hm.. Possibly, I'm planning on doing a domain xfer one of these days.. I'll test it out on a domain that I don't care about losing, first.
@_date: 2011-05-25 05:00:42
goodness, you had me rushing over to check trade data.. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:31:54
Well, when I checked my account this morning, Twilio Auth had been enabled. I did not do that. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:06:10
Yep, something along those lines. Totally my fault in that respect. I still have the culprit file (it's legitimate software bound with a malicious payload), so probably the closest thing I'd ever get to recourse is finding someone who can do malware analysis to see where it calls home to. 
It's definitely a RAT/RDP tool of some sort, and even if I were to find out where connects back to, at the very least they're probably using a dynamic DNS service to mask themselves.

All fair points, thanks. 
On Bittrex, I had most of my money on various tokens, including a large amount SNT that I bought cheaply. I should have withdrawn, since I was planning for a long hold.
On Bitfinex, I had just deposited ~2BTC yesterday, and had made calls on EOS. It went up.. at least the attacker sold high. :(
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:47:19
Approximately 5BTC -- although before trades it's 4BTC.. I made a buy last night on Bitfinex that would have netted 1BTC profit. 
I've already mentioned this once -- but least the attacker sold high. :) :(
Yesterday was the day that I decided to use windows, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:19:00
Yeah, it was windows, default network settings. I should not have been trading on that OS in the first place.
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:50:19
It is. However, I left it logged in on my desktop overnight. At this point, I'm 90% sure that my machine is compromised, and they used my local session to check my email.
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:39:48
Phone still works -- however I never had SMS set up intentionally. Somehow *they* were able to set it up (presume-ably with their own number). 
Edit: I would love to be able to see which number they used, but I can't seem to find it anywhere in Bitfinex's verifications page.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:45:27
Thanks, at this point I'm treating these coins as gone, but it sure would be nice to somehow get them back, despite the very low probability of that happening.
Yes, I trust my WiFi -- ISP is my own, internet is not shared, and my router is flashed with DD-WRT (it's been that way forever, so likelyhood of introducing an attack surface at that level is fairly low).
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:41:56
Can you expand? I'd love for this not to happen again.
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:36:03
Took me a while as I've been pretty sober all day.. But, good one. :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:29:29
They had access to my email &amp; Bitfinex user session (they were likely logged into my machine remotely, where I unfortunately had both email &amp; Bitfinex logged in).
I've learnt that once you've got these two things, all you need is a number to set up SMS verification, even if the account already uses token 2FA. So, essentially Bitfinex prioritizes SMS over token 2FA. The attacker did not use my phone number, they used a number from an online temporary SMS service. I actually [found it]( looks like they're quite active (lots of steam verification codes).
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:51:37
I'm considering this -- but what are really the chances of anything positive happening as a result? Have police recovered stolen crypto in the past?
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:40:13
Yup, sure do. Kicking myself hard, because I've got Arch Linux dualbooted.. I couldn't have just used that..
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:09:23
(TL;DR: Unsure if BFX has patched this security hole yet, if not they're aware of it, and I don't really have any recourse.)
It's funny, right? You *need* Token Auth 2FA if, say, you want to log in, or whenever you make a withdrawal. But, if you want to add SMS 2FA? Go right ahead, no existing 2FA method necessary (only an email confirmation is required).
It is terrible (and thank you for your sympathy), but BFX staff are aware of it and have claimed in writing (in an email on the day this happened) to me that their devs are on it.
I haven't retested myself since this all happened, so I'm not sure if it's fixed yet. They made it very clear to me that it's an edge-case security hole, and that I have no recourse outside of reporting to the police.. That said, I don't know of a single instance where the police have successfully recovered crypto to its rightful owner. They also made it clear that it's my fault (and they have a point, I was compromised locally and left everything signed in overnight). So, no real recourse unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:51:04
Sure, uh.. help me out, how can I best prove this to you? Addresses? Screenshots?
Here's the address it went to:
I have reached out to Bitfinex &amp; Bittrex support. I lost about 2BTC in Bittrex, and 3BTC in Bitfinex.
Here is what I know:
- Did not ever use SMS verification, but Twilio has been enabled on Bitfinex. Still not sure what happened on Bittrex.
- Used Google 2FA on both accounts
- Both accounts had different, long, random passwords. I use 1Password.
- Attackers must have had access to my email, because withdrawal-related messages are archived (and email confirmation is needed to withdraw in Bitfinex)
- My phone was physically away from my computer while I slept
- I have checked login logs on Bitfinex, and they all come from my IP. I live alone. So if this *was* a local attack, what's weird is they left my bitcoin-qt wallet intact.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:47:24
Update: Seems like the attackers added SMS to the verification options, and were able to withdraw that way.
Do I have any recourse here? Isn't 2FA supposed to prevent adding more confirmation options (especially 2FA)?
Another Update:
Bitfinex support replied, advising me to change my passwords and GAuth 2FA, and aside from that it looks like they can't do anything for me.
I now have the attacker's phone number: +447453444863 -- a quick google search leads to this [temporary SMS service]( ( In order to disable the SMS verification in BFX I had to use this service, probably in a very similar way that the attacker withdrew my funds.
So, PSA: On Bitfinex, in order to add an SMS verification method, all you need is access to the account, and the account's email. You do not go through GAuth 2FA at any point to add a phone number. You can add any phone number you like, as long as you have access to it in order to see confirmation codes.

Are they failing hard at their maths or am I just tired? 
Seems to me like the price should be 12k, not 120k, especially when they have 1200 for .1BTC listed right alongside..
@_date: 2013-06-07 03:21:10
I don't want to start a war ;) ... [AltusHost](
..the fact they 'allow' warez hosting makes this all a bit more unfortunate.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:24:18
Lol, nice try op who wants to dump.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:41:47
 ..ffs people why do you not use it, or talk about it? It's been around forever!
