So yes, if you have money, this is a good place to put it for the foreseeable future.

Losing pocket change and having pocket change.

Thank you!

If only this were covered in a item to the right!

This is when the crash gets real.  When all the money is drying up.

Will you guys let me trade BTC for some Magic the Gathering cards?

What is irony to you is just life to me.  In a way, it is nice to have the fact documented.   
I'm a day late for bitcoinbillionaire too.   See. :)

Hear!  Hear!
You know... it never even occurred to me that such a technique could be used for such purposes.  Quite a flaw in my thinking that seems to bite me in the ass more often than I'd like.  Some people never learn.

I had a similar experience.  I received word that it was picked up but my account was never credited.  I received word after about a week from CapOne that they rolled back the transaction because the account was on hold.  
I blame CapOne for putting the account on hold.  Maybe on a different day I'd be singing CapOne's praises for saving me.

Upvote for contrarian views!  Appreciate the links.

It is Monday in Japan.  Didn't anonymous promise a 24 hr Internet blackout on Monday?  Coincidence I'm sure.

I think I'd define a crash as a months or more gains lost in days.

I've been investigating forming a CU for those interested in BTC.  Need about 5000 people willing to sign their names saying that they want to be members - would cost about $5 to buy a share.   
By definition, it would be not for profit.   I read recently about someone trying to set up a BTC bank in FL USA.
Things are happening! 
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:43:49
Could very well be.  Was just looking into it because I was interested in it.  At some point, someone is going to do it, and it is member owned, and would be regulated.  When the time comes, I'm going to be part of it.

Sadly, that's what a real crash feels like.   Clearly I can't identify the support points, but I still believe in the premise.  Much depends upon the exchanges being available.   I learn more each day.

It is all about volume.  I 100% agree with you.  I think that the HoBBs have the means and inventive to stabilize the market.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:27
But the resultant panic selling is the same.  I think these shake outs are good for the long term prospects if it means that we head towards some sort of stabilization.

Congrats!  
I don't know if you intended it or not, but the small image version of this product looks like a schlong.  Not what I want to see when coming to More generally, not what I want to see...

Don't trust me, trust my argument.  Or don't.  :)
