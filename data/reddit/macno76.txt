That`s not the recent report the guy is talking about but the older one he posted to prove that the Dutch authorities are indeed researching the subject and monitoring banks. He did not post the most recent report/memo his bank got.

Are you talking about Bitcoin startups? Regular startups can get money ("Förderung") in other parts of Germany as well, Berlin has lots of such programs, but that does not change the hassle.

Nice! Have you applied for a BaFin licence or will you wait until they contact you?
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:42:53
I know, it`s german, but I thought you might like the picture :-)

It`s basically about this:

@_date: 2014-02-01 14:49:45
Ah ok, Thx!
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:32:04
Cool! Thanks! I shows up now, but still looks strange. One Bitcoin Logo and one for "hospital" (there was no dentist symbol). Other places show only the symbol for the bar or club.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:49:09
What exactly? 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:02:48
Oh, cool (the link, not the downtime), thx!
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:24:43
yeah, up to 10 EUR per bet. Nice game, but it does not fit the "fidor introduces bitcoin derivatives market" headline. I clicked it and was slighlty disappointed.
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:13:05
you would enter the realm of "money transmitting" which might require a specific license in any country i know of.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:41:32
actually it is. because "scam" is quite a hard accusation.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:50:33
That`s what Darkcoin is trying to do with those masternodes, isn`t it?
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:45:13
Go Lika!
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:11:30
Are you sure you are on Bitstamp and not some phishing site?
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:00:16
Link to the promotion thing? Could not find it on the site.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:28:59
Yes, it`s only a game. Nothing else. I swear. I`ve even tried it and no one wanted to bet against me. I has nothing to do with what the headline suggests. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:11:06
You don`t find anything about it on fidor because it is NOT important and they put it on their "financial games" site: 
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:02:37
No. If you dump 100.000 Coins on one push of a button on any single exchange I know you actually simply nuke the BID.
I.e. you have not enough liquidity at the exchange to fulfill an order. That`s if as Bill Gates dropped every last Microsoft Share he controlls onto the market, all at once.

Ah, thanks! You are right! I removed it from the "entrance", so it should be right with the nex upadte!
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:19:49
that`s only a game, you place bets on the bitcoin price and wait until another user bets against it (i`m a fidor customer from germany and have played that).
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:57:44
I`m actually struggling with coinmap.org right now to add my dentist uncle from Genoa, Italy, who accepts BTC since a year but I seem to have fucked up with the nodes or something (computer idiot here). It shows 3 places in Genoa now, it should be only two (my uncle and the bitcoin foundation italy). 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:46:42
Maybe it`s against the rules, I do not know that, but that`s another point. The burden of proof still lies in your court regarding the scam accusation.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:24:22
yeah, I know the thread, that`s how I found the reddit-link, but in they thread they talk about questions before getting Fiat out. Those questions before even bying BTC is even worse and sounds so incredible I had a hard time believing it.
@_date: 2017-01-01 11:57:06
Coming soon! 
@_date: 2017-01-01 11:33:08
It will allow customers to purchase Bitcoin in various forms from two way ATM (Lamassu) to Paperwallets with notary superveillance to vouchers. We will also offer hardware wallets and merchandise. Plus, we want to provide an Embassy like experience, with space for events, talks etc. We also want to promote Austrian economics and will offer books and information for that as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 11:35:38
I like the idea! �� 
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:08:27
Spot on! Kudos!
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:21:17
Yes we can! Go Dash!
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:30:54
Strange. She says it works for her (for me as well by the way)
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:25:07
She said she had fixed the problem, related to the max amount of active users at a time.
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:00:32
Very cool!
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:10:07
Oh, ok, thanks! I`ll tell her!
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:54:08
Folks, really? Only 5 people haven taken the survey?? I told the girl that Bitcoiners are eager to help...
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:49:13
I don`t get the joke, sorry. Are you implying she wants to hack you? I`ve met the girl at a Bitcoin Meetup in Berlin and I offered to help her, that`s it.
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:23:47
That would actually be about 18% per year? Sounds rather good to me.
