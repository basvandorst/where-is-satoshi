So its like arbitrage for electricity. Interesting concept

Can't lose value on a store-of-value coin if you can't transact with it

It's almost as if there should be one sub for bitcoin, where everyone could freely discuss their thoughts and opinions about it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:59:51
is a good sub to lurk. They're mostly interested in price though, so if you're into bitcoin for ideological reasons it may be less interesting

But who is 'we'? There are people out there who want bitcoin to be all sorts of things.


Segwit wasn't mentioned in the whitepaper at all. Neither was RBF. 
I spoke about a hypothetical tipping point, a point where, after many changes have been added, bitcoin ceases to be bitcoin. To me it looks like that time is now. Bitcoin has drifted far enough away from what it used to be that some might not consider bitcoin bitcoin anymore. That's not to say what we have now isn't a useful coin, but it has evolved to a point where the original idea of bitcoin doesn't match the goals of our community.
Just my two cents

Sounds like free money to me!

how else would you upgrade via hardfork? if there is replay protection then you end up with a chain split
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:17


Fair enough. But at what point does it stop becoming bitcoin? How far can we drift from the whitepaper's outline before it's a new crypto?

quadriga is usually overpriced because of low liquididity, consider the cad/usd exchange. I'll usually buy eth  on quadriga and transfer that over (to avoid the fees and wait-times) to other exchanges where I trade it.

If you only count core devs then yes, or core nodes. And the miners only agreed because of the NYA.
My point is that trying to get true consensus might be impossible.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:05:31
Segwit never had consensus though? How do we define consensus? Can bitcoin ever upgrade?
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:36:57


That's not Bitcoin though, people vote with their cpu power in Bitcoin. Blackcoin might be more up your alley
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:02:12
There’s plenty of devs and users and miners who didnt want it though. There’s a substantial amount of people in the community who did not want segwit is all I’m saying.

No worries. Bitcoin isn't held anywhere physically. The pc this guy bought contains the information (private keys) to claim (ie control) about $1100 worth of bitcoin

This is how I understood it from intro econ classes in university and college.
Bank receives deposits totalling $100.
Bank can now loan up to $90 and proceeds to do so.
Now we have $100 sitting in someones savings account and $90 floating around in the local economy after it was loaned to a new client. The total amount of money here is now $190, $90 has been 'created'.
This process continues as more deposits come in and more loans are made.
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:16:20
Those original deposits still 'count' as money, so the 'new' $90 is created money.
