Don't forget that there is always the chance that it could tank to pennies and you could lose a LOT of money. You have to see it from all angles.

Who gives a shit, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade do the same thing but you get to pay them for the pleasure of doing it as well.

Maybe that's what I'm thinking of. I wonder how much regret this guy feels every single day when he sees that thing.

I would think you would still make that same $1000 dollars bi-weekly, as the amount of BTC you would receive would be adjusted based on market price..

This kills the miner.

Ahhh thank you friend! I was very confused for a moment.

The address I posted was the address that the deposit came from, and as you can see it sent MANY deposits like this. I'm just curious if anybody else has seen this before.

You seem to lean a little too far to the left to have any luck in Texas. You might have better luck in another state?
I do agree with some of your views though. Best of luck to you!

Hello tempest :) its cnhash7. The one who saw it all happen and talked with you about it in chat haha. Glad to see you posted about it! 
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:21:13
Sure it will.
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:22:27
It could also be zero.

If people really believe in Bitcoin, why do they hold in hopes that it will allow them to cash out one day and be rich?
I've never understood that. It seems like you are more interested in making a quick buck than using the future of money.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:45:38
It could also be worth nothing.

You know it seems like all I ever hear is how Bitcoin is the future of all currency. It also seems like all I ever hear is how much FIAT you can get for it.
I dunno, it just seems to me that people are only concerned with getting rich off of it, and not actually changing the world's financial system.

You been living under a rock? Many exchanges have been hacked and millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin stolen.
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:58:13
Except it's not secure or stable.
See all the massive coin thefts and insane volatility for example.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:28:44
You are in denial lol
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:22:30
So we don't wanna talk about the hard fork?

You guys really didn't see this coming?
It happens over and over. Big bubble, bubble pops, price eventually settles just a little bit higher than it used to be.
Rinse and repeat to crazy values in 20 years.

Stuff like this is why I don't mess with crypto anymore. Too many scammers and dishonest people trying to pull one over on others.
I miss it :(
