Add that to a $100 hardware wallet. that's a good bit of money i could be putting into btc and storing in my blockchain wallet. 
what's the cutoff? at what point is it worth the investment to be totally secure? should i spend $200 to protect $200?

gdax but the money needs to be in gdax already so start the bank xfer asap.

Why are these wallets better than blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:09:38
same alerts buddies!!

@_date: 2017-11-17 03:46:38
also curious. am i safe in my blockchain wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:54
use a software wallet for now. hardware wallet when u have more than 500 in there. just my thoughts.

3k for a klr isn't horrible depending on the area. theres a stupid misconception that all of a sudden everyone is getting these bikes for a great value. the popularity of adventure bikes and street legal dirtbikes is exploding and Craigslist prices are blowing up.

same. kids are butthurt that they got scammed by Roger ver and just went full t_d on our asses. 
i don't care. i bought btc at the dip caused by those idiots and now I'm rocking some high energy numbers. go ahead and downvote me, brigaders, it won't affect the btc i own.
