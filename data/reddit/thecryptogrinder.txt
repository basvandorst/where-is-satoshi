That's something I cannot answer at this time as I usually just use bitcoin to buy alts.  Once you're in an exchange the purchasing isn't too bad.
Truthfully it depends on a lot of factors.
* The direct from USD exchange you were using.  These have fees.
* The transaction fees of the coin itself.
I just generally think it is a bad idea.  Can you put you money in a stash for a bit and buy in bulk on the next "crash"?  Do that.
Hey, as soon as I get enough comment Karma (and days of this account being open) to post on I'm going to start posting articles I've been writing about various trading topics.  Anything you'd be interested in?

Will it be vastly usable in everyday transactions in its current form?  While some may say yes, I'd doubt it.
But look at the leaps and bounds alts are hurdling through and I believe you'll see a different picture.  In case you weren't aware, there is a great tech race going on right now and bitcoin is not the sole player.

Granted, there are some alts where it might be feasible.

There are too many completely anonymous cryptos these days.  If you go over regulation, then it'll go the way of porn... we know Chinese watch porn, they use TOR, VPN, etc.  Going overboard causes people to ignore regulations altogether.
However, make more guidelines and people will stay in it  a lot more.

Transfers cost money.  Coinbase will charge you to move it.  Wait until you have more.
Ideally, you'd put your 25 away each week/month/whatever and buy like $500 in one go and from there you can play alts, etc.
Every time you move money from coinbase you lose.  I don't remember how coinbase does it because it has been a bit of time, but I believe it is a set amount per transaction.  Combined with regular fees from miners and you have yourself a problem.
Bitcoin is a tool worth working, not a magical money machine.

It feels a bit more complicated than that, though, right?  Just from looking at their fees page.

for GDAX?

I'm not familiar with GDAX, but I do know that different exchanges often have a different culture and this can change things when stuff goes rapidly wrong.
Furthermore, are you looking at a reporting site with all of them?  Maybe some sites send their reports quicker than others to the conglomerate tracker site.

My bad, thanks!

Buying 10/day straight from fiat is a bad idea due to fees.
Don't buy bitcoin daily from fiat.

Come back next week and you'll be feeling much better than that guy is right now.

Well if you buy BTC with an alt on an exchange, it'll usually just cost 0.2%!  :D

Do you follow alts as well?
I'm highly interested in altcoins and I believe one of the greatest aspects of bitcoin for me is that it has allowed me to speculate on Alts.
Still speculation, but speculation facilitated by bitcoin.

Alts are like pokemon:
Supposedly the same species, yet some can fly high while others only make a splash.
