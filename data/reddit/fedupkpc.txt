And there in lies the problem. I’m just in a shitty position and there nothing I’m going to be able to do about it. Fml

Did you have to put up any collateral

I made the mistake of spending money before it was in my bank account ( paying bills ) and now I’ve got transactions that are going to post, decline, and cause me a lot of problems. I have money but it’s limbo with Coinbase, I won’t be able to access it for another two days. I don’t understand why Coinbase does that. They say it’ll be on hold for a few days but it ends up being like 14 business days. It’s killing me. I promise I can pay whom ever back plus interest. It would still save me so much.

To cover a payment that is pending in my bank account at this very moment. I’m so screwed. I have money but my funds are tied up with Coinbase and won’t be released for another 24 hours. I don’t know why Coinbase does that, it’s killing me.  Literally, I think I’m going to die from stress. I promise I can pay back the loan with interest asap. I’d be oh so grateful and I won’t screw you over.

Did you have to have collateral?

Just in case anyone is feeling that flippen awesome.... my btc address is 3LebWcj7J3tLHU8L4j5cp4ShRgbbfJuVXG
dm me with your address so I can pay you back and then some. If not, I’ll just pay it forward and send the $2 owed plus my $2 to someone else. Ya never know, that would be pretty awesome if it kept going. Heh, is that what a pyramid scheme is though?  Not my intentions!

I know there prob isn’t such a thing but is there anywhere to go and be able to get like a $100 btc loan with no collateral?  Ugh, I sound so pathetic.

I know. It’s ridiculous but I honestly need like $1.78

To help the world go round. To be generous. To help someone out.  If I was able to help someone who was in my position, I totally would.
