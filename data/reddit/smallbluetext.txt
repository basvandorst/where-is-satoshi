It's the same steps you followed when you first installed it. Exit Bitcoin core, download and install the new one. Done.

My point still stands. Unless Bitcoin is going to force Tor networking (wouldn't be a bad idea) then you are relying on clearnet ports.

If it's only memorized and not stored anywhere physically or digitally then they can't actually seize your coins but they may know your wallet addresses and it could be a problem trying to move those coins without legal issues. Monero doesn't have that problem since even if they know your wallet address it can't be viewed on a public ledger.

If your node doesn't accept incoming connections then it is simply another copy of the blockchain being stored. Nobody is connecting to your node and therefore it may as well not exist to anyone else. Therefore, not a full node.
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:04:12
If everyone has closed ports, nobody is able to download the blockchain. You are always relying on people with open ports in the end.
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:43:49
Don't forgot to open ports for incoming connections too, otherwise it isn't truly a full node.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:20:06
The problem with this kind of thinking is that if all archival nodes go offline, your "full node" won't be able to serve up full copies of the blockchain and the network would be crippled. Especially if all nodes somehow went offline and needed to redownload the blockchain. You're right but I wish we could just remove the idea of archival nodes. Those are actual **fully complete blockchain nodes**.

I've got it on a cheap 2TB from prime day, and I literally don't care how much bandwidth it uses unless I'm doing something big!

Great wisdom, thank you for blessing me with your time.

The ones that bought at peak aren't the ones that pushed it there. Everyone buying together (more than selling) in the same time frame is what causes the price to rise over time and that includes your buys. Whales make the big moves of course but in the end the price is determined by everyone.

I took Charlie's advice and sold it all when he did. LTC is only used when the BTC network is slow and expensive so until that happens again I won't use it.

Those guys really need to try BitMex. They think they can lose money fast on Robinhood options but wait till they have 100x leverage on BTC during a [BART](

In addition to the other replies, another benefit is that since every full node (archival node technically) is a complete record of the blockchain then it is directly contributing to the decentralization of Bitcoin. The more we have and the more widespread they are then the harder it is to take down the network or to do something malicious.  
  
This is true for miners too, we do need both nodes and miners to be widespread.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:31:25
Satoshi did discuss the fact that mining will become more centralized over time as big companies and data centres join the network. It is inevitable unless we actively try to prevent it when it becomes dangerous for a 51% attack.

LTC is still taxed along with every other crypto trade in my country (Canada)

They can I'm just giving examples of how pools incentivise you to use them.

That's actually 1 computer but multiple monitors. Maybe something else powering the small displays but it could also be from that PC to the right.

I'm there with you but I'm not worried man. I bought between 3.6-7k and if it comes down below 5k I'm grabbing more. People who got into this game and didn't check the history are at fault themselves. This has happened multiple times with bitcoins price and I just finally wised up in 2017 after first noticing in 2013.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:55:19
I run a full node because why not? I have unlimited fibre internet so I happily upload ~500GB/month to other nodes :)
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:56:32
Better to say they haven't waited long enough.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:39:26
Incentives such as lower pool fee, random luck events, better payout frequency or lower minimum, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:17:44
More than 50% of traders lose money, probably more than 65% in total across all platforms. This is completely normal.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:09:29
Yes, however volatility does decrease over time which the total volatility chart shows is true for Bitcoin so far. It trends downwards and the spikes get smaller.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:14:48
Not feasible yet. Solar works best when it takes advantage of the day/night cycle. Miners need 24/7 reliable power which would mean a massive battery bank for guaranteed overnight use (assuming no downtime in generated solar power). Too expensive and takes up a loooooot of space.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:01:40
Would love to see a slow dynamic block size. It feels like a great solution as long as the requirements don't get too high too fast.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:10:50
High volatility (what you depict in that chart) does not = moon. It could, or it could be a massive crash. Both are extremely high volatility events. 
  
Edit: further down you actually mention this, so I'll take it the moon was a bit in jest.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:57:44
Adding on to this, it is determined by the price they are willing to pay **right now**. This tells you nothing about what price was paid by the current Bitcoin users, and of course it varies wildly. So market cap is really just a better way of looking at the price including factoring in the supply but has no meaning on how valuable all bitcoins together are.

December was the 3rd concert and ive already got my ticket to the 4th
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:18:32
I wouldnt worry about having a whole coin just yet. Most people don't actually start with that.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:44:42
But are we complaining? Long term hodlers just see a sale a buy more. If it hurts to see dont look for a few months and hope for the best but I enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:53:23
They allow credit cards which includes those debit/credit cards many people already have. You just need the card and you're in and buying coins. I would say that accounts for a large chunk of the increase.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:32:30
Look what its doing right now. I think it has a bright future as the silver to bitcoins gold.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:06:59
Maybe hold some Tether for those times? I havent looked into enough to know if thats actually worth doing. It does match USD though so it doesnt have these dips.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:41:59

@_date: 2017-09-05 23:28:25
There is no long term pattern so good luck!
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:26:47
Fundamental value is more accurate. Nothing is truly intrinsically valuable that I am aware of.

In-client search is the best method because you avoid the site completely. For qBittorrent I just type something  and get results from tons of sources and sort by seeders.
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:25:39
That's the value we as humans have assigned still. We made all this shit up remember. Where is the value to non-humans?
