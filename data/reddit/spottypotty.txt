When you want to receive some bitcoin, you need to create a private/public key pair. You keep your private key absolutely secret and give the public key to the entity that wants to send you the bitcoin.
Wallets simplify things for you as they create the keys for you. Some also give you a random list of 12 words to remember instead of the actual private key. The 12 words are much easier to write down. As long as you know these 12 words you can recreate a new wallet on a brand new device, provide the 12 words and you have access to all your funds.
Any one can see how much bitcoin is stored at a particular public key so some wallets create a new one (aka address) for each transaction.
So, you can back up your 12 words on paper, on multiple usb keys (encrypted for safety), etc... If one of them gets lost/stolen/corrupted, you don't lose your bitcoin.
If your phone gets stolen then you need to transfer your coins to another address because otherwise the thief might gain access to the keys in your wallet and transfer your coins to their address.

Ok, thanks!

Thanks And everyone else actually. This is a nice, friendly and responsive community.

I copied down the backup strings but I'm wondering: is the backup stored on my phone or on the cloud?
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:35:58
Transfer to an address that you own (your wallet)
@_date: 2015-10-22 21:18:26
What other kind of transaction could it be if not on a blockchain?  
I've been digesting this new info and was wondering, if all "coins" are stored in the blockchain,  what does cold storage mean and what are the advantages of a hardware wallet?  
Also, I transferred a part or your tip to my wallet but the transaction hasn't shown up yet. How long does it usually take? I know that there are a different number of confirmations that can be selected for a transaction but why is one confirmation not enough?  
Do the 12 backup words only work with myceleum or do other wallets use the same algorithm?   
Can I back up and restore my private and public keys directly?  
Sorry for all the questions but I feel like I've opened a can of worms :)

First challenge: how to transfer from changetip to my wallet. I'll have fin figuring it out.

Thanks. To start I already created a mycelium wallet and transferred some bits that someone was kind enough to tip me. My questions derived from my attempt to understand what was happening behind the scenes as well as trying to digest what I read in people's discussions in this subreddit.

In the past, when I've had to generate a private key, I was made to move my mouse around and type on the keyboard to generate some randomness. How does Mycelium introduce randomness into its key generation?

You mean storing your keys, right?

Hi,  
  
Ignore this if I'm wrong but I suspect that you might be suffering from the same misconception that I had when I was trying to understand all of this.  
You don't store any "coins" in your wallet. When you want to receive some bitcoin, you need to create a private/public key pair. You keep your private key absolutely secret and give the public key to the entity that wants to send you the bitcoin.  
Wallets simplify things for you as they create the keys for you. Some also give you a random list of 12 words to remember instead of the actual private key. The 12 words are much easier to write down. As long as you know these 12 words you can recreate a new wallet on a brand new device, provide the 12 words and you have access to all your funds.

If your phone gets stolen then you need to transfer your coins to another address because otherwise the thief might gain access to the keys in your wallet and transfer your coins to their address.  
I'm relatively new at this so I hope I didn't make too many mistakes.

Really great answer. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:28:58
So, are the public addresses just public keys in a private/public key-pair?  
  
Is the following correct?  
We generate a private key to create kind of a new "bitcoin account".  
We can create multiple public keys associated with each private key. Creating new public keys for different transactions helps with anonimity.  
  
Creating multiple private keys helps with not losing everything if one private key is compromised.

Thanks for the clarification. It confims my theory of how this stuff works. It was not so straightforward to reach this understanding with the usual narrative. I find the terminology to be a little misleading as it encouraged me to apply my knowledge of physical currency to my attempt to understand bitcoin, which initially put me on the wrong track.

Good tip. I'll try that.

I'm going to read up about addresses and what they actually mean. Thanks!

Yes, if someone gets access to your private key, they get access to your funds. That's why you will read about people using "cold storage". If the only place that your private key is written on is a piece of paper or a device that was never connected to the internet, there is no way that a hacker could access it.  
For important amounts it seems like people split their funds across a number of keys.  
  
Wallets (software) and websites generate keys for you. That's the first step when creating a wallet. It asks you if you want to import an existing wallet or if you want to create a new one. You can provide the details of an existing wallet to import by giving the private key, or the 12 words, or a QR Code (that the software would have printed for you when you exported or backed up the wallet).  
Sorry I forgot to mention it. I use Mycelium on my android phone. I don't know which other wallets have the 12 word feature.  
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:37:56
I see. So if I understood correctly, all of my transactions are signed with a private key, which can be re-generated from my 12 backup words. Since all transactions are stored on the Blockchain then I can retrieve my balance on a new device by just re-generating my private key. So my "wallet" doesn't really have any "coins" stored in it. I.E. I don't lose funds by losing my phone, but by losing my private-key / backup words.
@_date: 2015-10-27 19:30:08
Excellent!  Thanks. I was wondering how it was possible to create multiple public keys per private key. I see now that it's not the case.
