Ok I think I understand now. To get benefits of any future forks I need to have control of my keys in my wallet right?
With this being the case if I were to remove my btc from coinbase into a wallet so that I will immediately benefit from future forks, does that mean if coinbase were to allow support for bitcoin gold in the future, I wouldn't get any since I took my btc off their exchange before they added support? Or would they still debit the balance of my btc in btc gold as of the fork date assuming I have any claim in the first place?

Coinbase/GDAX will not sell or keep Bitcoin Gold associated with customer Bitcoin for itself. Any Bitcoin Gold will remain securely stored on Coinbase. If Coinbase were to enable support for Bitcoin Gold at a future date, customers would be able to withdraw Bitcoin Gold associated with their Coinbase/GDAX Bitcoin balances at the time of the Bitcoin Gold fork.
That being said assume one day they support it and allow it to be withdrawn, do I now own bitcoin gold based on my current situation?

Ok thank you, now I'm not sure whether it is an option on their site at the moment, but would I have to pay some sort of tax if I were to trade one crypto for another without using usd but rather LTC-&gt;BTC for example.

Ive tried emailing them about it and basically what they said is “sorry we cant offer support for bitcoin gold at this time” which had nothing to do with my question. Like they didn’t even read my support ticket.
Is there any way to check if i have it? If i were to get my coins off the exchange how would I get the bitcoin gold off? Assuming I could get bitcoin gold off the exchange if I were to have had an active balance before the date there must be a way to check right? Even if I had to move my balance from the site into a wallet which I’m open to.

I don't even know if I have it or not. Please reread carefully. What i'm asking is do I have ownership of either since I bought well before the fork date, but it wasn't debited to my account until after.

How do I lower the fees from coinbase? Its trying to charge .0018... for sending my coins to my blockchain wallet which is just ridiculous and im in no rush id wait a week for it to transfer if I could do it for cheap. 
Also im trying to do it via the coinbase app.
