Considering how irresponsible Gox has been in everything, who would  trust Gox's AML/FYC?

Since there is no business that I'm aware of in leading BTC, then how can they possibly profit from holding coins?  And if they can't profit, how can they pay you interest?
My guess is that's it's a ponzi scheme.  Or they are waiting until enough BTC's are invested, at which point they'll pull a Silk Road 2 routine, claim they got hacked, and take off with all the bitcoin themselves.

"Here in Reddit many seem to want Gox simply to go bankrupt. I don't think it's good for the bitcoin economy. "
MtGox is done.  It's over.
And the bitcoin economy is doing fine.

If you want to build a US exchange, the tech part isn't the issue. It's the money and months you're going to spend get approvals for the fed regulators and then 48 state regulators. 
The reason there are no big American exchanges (and obviously you're not the first person to think of creating one) are the onerous regulations.

If you are presenting an argument about a secure way to store bitcoins, seems to me your target audience already knows about the technology. Therefore starting your video with, 'have you ever wonder why people are facinated by bitcoin' seems like a waste of time.  I stopped watching at that moment.
Just my two cents.

No, we should not give money to people.  Just whatever banks that might have got involved.  After all, if anybody doesn't understand financial risk, it's banks.  People, on the other, should know and accept the risks.

Problem with Bitcoin and documentaries is that by the time the film is complete, it's outdated.  Bitcoin moves that fast.
Plus, there were at least three similar films in production as of April 2013 - that I was aware off.  The only one that surfaced recently was The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.  And that one is supposedly outdated.
Last, unless you're planning to give the film away for free, making money of documentaries is exceptionally difficult.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:35:26
Bitcoin is growing at an extraordinary rate - yet you find fault in 90% of the people who fuel the growth, whatever their agenda.
Start your own currency which doesn't have the incentives of Bitcoin, and see how that works out.

Mtgox is incompetent.  That's been know known since.... i dunno... maybe when they were still Magic the Game Online Xchange. Using them has always carried higher risk, hence the higher USD value of their coin.

In the articles comments section, I posted this response:
Dear Professor,
Rather then dispute your analysis point for point , I've realized that you have a fundamentally divergent world view from bitcoins proponents.  Thus the only quick way I can address what I find wrong in your article is via analogy.
Imagine it is 1995.  The web browser hasn't been invented.  The resulting human and economic revolution hasn't transpired, and the internet hasn't become inescapably entrenched in our lives.  And in that year, you author an article stating that the internet lacks the properties of a real business medium.
You write that....
1) There is no trust on the internet.  It's anonymous.  One can never be sure who one is communicating with.  Thus trust - which is fundamental to transactions between buyer and seller - cannot be done.
2) There is no payment system on the Internet.  If one is to buy a product, one needs to mail a check, then the seller has to wait for it to clear before safely prior to mailing the item.  Which may take a month or longer.  Who would want to wait that long when going out to a brick and morter store is faster. Sending ones banking information to an untrusted "other party" will simply be too dangerous and no serious business will embrace that.
3) The internet is too vast to search.  A catalog of interesting links going by the quit foolish name of Yahoo and manually maintained, will never handle vast amount of information.  And if the internet is too vast to search, then how will buyer find seller and vice versa?
4) Websites can be hacked.  Nobody will put their important information onto websites.
5) People like to try the clothes they want to buy, peruse the books they want to buy.  There is no way to judge what products your buying by looking at  slow text displays on a monitor.
6)  Asking people to use the internet for entertainment is like asking them to use a typewriter as such.  Not promising, is it?
7) The world is full of languages.  If the world is to be connected by the internet, how will people understand each other enough to trasnact?
... you get the drift.  
In the bitcoin world, it is 1995.  What bitcoin proponents see is what the Jeff Bezo's of the world saw in 1995. There are many problems in need of solutions.  Solutions will come.  Fortunes will be made.  Humanity will be changed.  
You'll see.  Enjoy the ride.
With respect...

I suspect they can't get distribution but don't want to say it.   I've a made documentary before (VOICES OF IRAQ).  We got a distributer and it was a bitch.  Very hard to get one as there's little money in distributing docus.
Youtube does (or did) a rental model.  Otherwise, they use youtube to load up the docu in small 5min clips, and play commercials on each. Youtube will pay you a small amount for each commercial, so you need to rack up massive views to make money.

I'm sorry you lost so many BTC.  And yes it is MtGox's fault for imploding the exchange and taking your coins.
But it is also your fault for not educating yourself about BTC, the market, the history of exchanges going under, and over a year of people warning about MtGox's problems.
So no, you weren't stupid.  You were naive and irresponsible as an investor.
Which most of the people who avoided loosing coins on MtGox, were not.
just my two cents.

Google is your friend.  Put a little effort into educating yourself rather than expecting people to do it for you.
And if you can't learn on your own what exactly bitcoin is, than mining will be too complex for you

"We will also provide an API that will allow our customers to use this hash to retrieve the transaction hash as seen in the blockchain once the transaction is confirmed, and will hope others (blockchain.info?) will index this value one day."
lol, as if anybody legitimate will trust Mark's (Magic-the-online-game-Xchange joker) code or hashes.  At least I hope not.
The faster MtGox terminates, the better.  Only then, I suspect, will the value of BTC start climbing again.

Not to be rude, but you should google this info.  If you're not resourceful enough to learn the basics without asking people to explain, then mining is not for you.

I used Virool on a big marketing campaign.  Paid them thousands.  
Turned out to be a waste of money.  Further, after a month, a significant portion of the views recorded by youtube - disappeared.  Were they ever real?  Who knows.  I don't.  Repeated tech support requests to Virool to fix that situation or credit us for the missing views we paid for, lead nowhere.  We just got the run around from Virool.
I would not use them again nor recommend them.
