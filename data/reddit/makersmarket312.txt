No they aren't lying to you, technically... I'll start this out by saying I'm not a Coinbase advocate or employee, but I definitely use it with trust to purchase BTC from USD. 
By using Coinbase - (which I use to), when you initially deposit (assuming USD) dollars in to your account, you're buying Bitcoin at a premium (priced over the actual Market) of about 1%. So if the price of 1 BTC is $100 (simple example); Coinbase will sell you a BTC with your debit card or bank account for $101 (+1%)... So immediately (and this is considering no fees, you're down $1 right off the bat.. 
This is common, not a scam, and much cheaper of a means to acquire bitcoin without the risk of 100% loss compared to buying from localbitcoin or other OTC website..
So going back to the question, yes, you've lost 1% upon immediate purchase. And once you account for fees, it could be up to 4% or so. 
So let's say as the example above I put, you bought when BTC was at it's high for the day, which is (in this example) $100.... You paid a price of $101... Let's say the price of BTC continues to drop throughout the day. Your purchase may look like you paid above the daily high of BTC, since you paid $101.....
This is where things get interesting but Coinbase doesn't go allout in advertising..... 
I trade and will advocate for [pro.coinbase.com]( it's a fantastic site and even further more you can transfer USD into your account without a fee and buy when you'd like to buy.... You don't have to create a new account to trade on Coinbase Pro.... Your Coinbase account automatically allows you to access Coinbase Pro. There's no fees, and you can trade your BTC much like a stock. Buy dips, sell rips..
Hopefully this helps a bit? I'd love to share more. !

Also, do not buy and sell on coinbase (coinbase itself) to trade for profit.... Only use trading on CB if you can get into (formerly known as GDAX) but Coinbase Pro.
PS: In this Example. $300 would have netted you $287.90 of Bitcoin (BTC 0.03422) without the market moving (attaching hopefully what will show up, a screenshot using CB) .
\-------Here's the math, screenshot didn't attach:
If you want to trade instead of hold  - definitely use CB Pro. If you can't in MN, what about a transfer of your BTC to exchanges like binance to trade?
