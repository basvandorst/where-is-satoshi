I write algorithms that can analyse your hand writing and guess reliably if you are a man or a woman. Neural networks are masters at data analysis. Using them I was only able to have 90% monthly gains compared to 60% from just holding. Perfect trading will allow for 260% more gains. So the market is almost random and it's skillful gambling really, just like poker.

Value is in the tech. It's revolutionary tech to be able to have decentralized money, you can send to anyone anywhere securely without any restrictions. No government or entity can seize it. It's the best sort of money you can own. 10k is a steal for what you get.

It's not a problem if you hold your coin and don't enter the shark tank unless you know what you are doing. People who see a red candle and sell will be parted with their coins very fast. You see a dump you buy, because if you sell then someone just got your coin for cheap and you just fed a whale.

There are already many shops that will not take cash for saftey reasons, also visa takes a cut and has charge backs. With bitcoin you know you are safe. You just need a vision into the future, it's hard to see but it will come. Just like how email replaced mail.

yeah but was there an 'event' that caused that?

Bitcoin is not value producing either. It's a currency, just like any other currency except it's not inflationary. There is no reason why it can't have a market cap equal to the Yuan or the Dollar.

LOL read the statistic your self, he is misinterpreting the statistic. What the statistic says is that "addresses that hold more than 1 bitcoin make up 3% of all addresses, these addresses hold 96% of the wealth."  So the wealth is spread over 694189 addresses.

The more volatile the more it earns. I ran it on old data and it doesn't gain more than just holding if the prices are stable. once you get dips it predicts 50% of the dips and sells before and buys after the dip. In the end you have 60% more bitcoins on average one month run. Ran it on many data sets since 2013 (i excluded mtgox)
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:18:59
Nope a whale dumping, I saw it live. I was on the exchange when it happened. It's already recovering.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:11:55
It doesn't matter, it will happen whether they like it or not. Once we have a reliable way for quick transactions then it's game over. Most payments now occur online and no one uses paper money all that much. Why would any sane person have his money stored in inflation dollars.

Bitcoin survived worse things and recovered even stronger. It crashes 30% in hours while very big names scream BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE and it still comes back strong. I don't know if a bubble can survive things like this. If even gold crashed 30% and you had Jamie Dimon, Warren Buffet,  Joseph Stiglitz and many big names saying 'GOLD IS A BUBBLE' then it will probably crash even more and never recover.

Guarantying when or how much is impossible. But it will happen, it has to happen, that's how the market moves. I don't know if it will correct to 12k, 15k, 20k etc. Or if it will correct today, tomorrow, a month from now etc. It's always better to buy when the price has had correction, puts you in a better mindset. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:22:56
Don't buy more than you can afford to lose. Puts you in a better space.

A lot of incentives. No charge backs. International payments. Instant payments. (visa takes days and they take a percentage and there is a chance they will not even give you the money). Also there are many millionaires who own bitcoin and are itching to spend some of it without converting to USD every time they buy. So expanding the customer base is also nice. If I open a company like amazon and I accept bitcoin, imagine how many people who own bitcoin will buy from me, I can have more customers because I am accepting more methods of payments.

Don't sell, BCash might pump again. They do this everyone now and then to sell their mined BCash at a better price.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:30:08
Did they actually collab to do this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:15:08
Supply and demand will correct things. More demand for electricity will make it more expensive and less profitable to mine. Electricity in china is 0.02 cents KW, that might change. Bitcoin price will eventually stabilize too. Markets always work out in the end.

I just saw a HUGE SELL WALL AT 11300 on gdax get eaten up in seconds. I have tears on my face, it was SCARY
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:51
it's called something's number. It's supposed to be hard to breach. forgot exactly what it's called.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:16:07
Good question, I never really considered 'cashing out' but I am intrigued.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:37:16
every wave is made up of smaller waves, so there is many small dips in a wave going up. and there is many peaks in a wave going down. these are not corrections. a correction is bigger than this, in bitcoin we are used to 20%-40% but recently they seem to have gotten smaller 15%-20%
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:22
This is beautiful. :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:00:00
I am getting down-voted not sure why.. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:18:52
I want healthy corrections and consolidations instead of a 1 big crash :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:00:03
actually only 2046 combos. If he forgot just the last word
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:34:02
those people got in before you knew it was going to go live. when the news hits then everything is already set.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:06:10
because of orphaned blocks. If it's too fast then two people might mine a block at the same time, which sucks.

Japan will be a very wealthy nation in the future because it will hold so much capital.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:36:35
That's like the most basic thing you need to know about bitcoin, there can only be 21 million, and that's not going to be mined until all of us are dead.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:30
buy a little everyday, and if it dips then buy with the rest all at once
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:28:16
500 BTC on GDAX and more on bitfinex. That guys is starting a new life. Lucky bastard. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:16
The pump is not coming from a single exchange, also exchanges require personal info for usd. I don't think they want to get caught red handed buying on exchanges. If they want to do something like you said they will do it OTC. Futures market is regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:21:10
We'll control the government, because we pay them. Also no one will control bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:33
$200 dollar lesson is a very cheap and a bargain. Be happy that you only lost this much.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:20:44
It's so beautiful. People learn quick, and they become wiser, building immunity to those cheap schemes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:29:06
He just said why, people were worried about a crash, we broke the ATH which is a very good sign.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:42
I never understand people who want to buy at the middle of the bull run. You had all last week and now you want to buy immediately. FOMO not a good strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:11
I don't understand how those things work exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:50:21
'WE'??? the government made it illegal to keep gold and took it away from people. Fiat is the biggest scam in history.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:41

@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:48
These whales are literally shaking people out of their coins. They sell, hit stop losses, buy back. That's an unregulated market, you have to learn this shit. These whales feed on stop losses.

High fees help with segwit adoption since they give more incentive, more wallets need to adopt segwit first.

It will be stable once it has a few trillion dollars market cap. 1 bitcoin will be worth 1 bitcoin

This will be WW3, bitcoin safest asset.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:08:21
That's not how it works. It takes much less to drop the market cap much more. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:09:05
stompede is when lightning network is proven not to be vaporware and shops start accepting bitcoin. that's going to be a revolution. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:36:38
Whales flushing out the weak hands. Look at the bitcoin price chart since the invention of bitcoin. This is an unregulated market, so whales dump and buy back cheaper. Just HODL and buy the fucking dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:58:23
SELL BITCOIN, THEIR WEBSITE IS TERRIBLE. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR BITCOINS FOR EVER....

You can go milk a bull. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:11:43
You will soon realize that it was a better idea to just keep the bitcoins. These miners will never mine their price in bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:38
Maybe fiat currencies will collapse sooner than I expected.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:13:24
FIAT is in a bubble. Imagine if bitcoin miners can just 'print' bitcoins as much as they want, is that fair? That's what governments do with their fiat money. One day people will wake up to what the reality of what makes money 'money'.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:44:30
If you have no skill+experience+luck you would probably end up losing most of your money. It's not as easy as it looks. You can always dip your feet with a small amount of play money.

How would you increase btc price with more btc? you can only dump
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:49:27
He basically said we want to have everyone use the banks and abolish cash so we can trace where the money goes. Is that what we come to? Listen to the last bit. It's sad.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:43
cause someone can beat you up and take it? it can be counterfeit? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:27:13
He keeps the rest? LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:04:56
I think he meant wealth distribution in bitcoin.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:59:41
renounce the stupid citizenship, keep millions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:10:34
Don't push the bitcoin vs banks issue too much. It's best that we become much bigger first then we strike.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:19:16
and then the horror starts. When you have so many people who are millionaires on paper decide to cash out, mean while no one wants to buy something dropping in price. The horror. Once the input of money into bitcoin slows down the price will follow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:33
Because you have two teams, one using dollars facing the 4 digit 5 digit hurdle, and another market which use KRW and other currencies that don't care about that psychological hurdle. Dissonance happened so you had one market trying to pull up and the other trying to pull down. I mean it went to 9300 for USD pairs and it was 11000 on KRW pairs. It was interesting to watch them trying to decide on what the price should be.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:20
not just gdax, coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, bitfinex and probably more all had problems. too much traffic and it had a domino effect when coinbase started facing problems and the users flooded the others.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:04
This is a joke right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:36:24
Why will they strike at 2018 new years lol fud
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:03:19
I love corrections. Makes me trust the progress more. This is in no way a correction. I want the price to go so low that you can feel the people resisting selling. Then start fresh with a new set of strong hands.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:42:55
I don't remember, maybe ENBD
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:14:28
Government is way too big. Cut government funds by 90%. 10% through voluntary public funding. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:50:18
One exchange flooded and broke down, people left for other exchanges and they also flooded and they broke down. Too much traffic crashed most major exchanges. People panicked and started withdrawing fiat becuase they are worried about the exchanges going GOX on them. It will all come back to normal and the bulls will keep on running. Keep your coins on a cold wallet and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:11:39
The s2x fork was dead on arrival, not because it had one bug, but multiple. It was a complete dud.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:10:26
Why? There was one person complaining about a BitOasis transaction being rejected from the bank two days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:16:10
So true. S2X was going to be a disaster. Now this shit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:21:54
It was created by a group of companies to hijack bitcoin dev from core. It's a political fork more than a tech fork. It's not like 2mb is going to make much of a noticeable difference longterm.

The devs decided to wait for lightning network instead. They think that increasing the block size constantly will lead to centralization.

People selling because exchanges went down? that's pathetic. GTFO and give me your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:26:19
GDAX, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken and probably many others. Probably some sort of a domino effect. Except Korean exchanges seem to be doing fine.  Also too many new weak hands that need to be parted from their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:52:12
Yeah I know but some people think it's this sweet magical gravy train to the moon. It's full of dips and crashes and for many this was a great way for them to get their cherry popped by the giant volatile crypto dick.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:49
That's a good idea. I don't know why I never thought of that. DUH
