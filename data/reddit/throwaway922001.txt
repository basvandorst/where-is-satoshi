I guess im stupid, idk. Just wanted to cash out. I just sold the entire piece: 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:30:37
I can still use the exchange, just purchased 0.01 eth as a test. Just so strange how the deposit never went through.. could a faulty employee actually of stolen my btc?
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:42:12
(he deleted his comment) but he said that btc wasn't 2.2k at the time I sold it ..

Yeah according to the transaction history, it processed.. but I never received it.
Lawyer time :P

Positive. Gemini even states that the transaction was successful.

will give them a contact tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:44:15
Complete mistake on my part. :(
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:06:35
Will give it a go tomorrow, Wish I didn't wait so long.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:14:52
Never thought of it like this, this could possibly be true. I'm an idiot for doing such a big withdrawal, should've done some test transactions.. :'(
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:35:18
Seriously considering it at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:36:11
Worked for me lol. I had it transferred through a wire transfer if that makes a difference.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:46:05
Sorry for the misunderstanding, I sold the BTC back in July, the month I initially transferred it. Around 3.4 million would be transferred out of Gemini into my account. I assumed since It's a large amount of money, it would take a while to process. I am seeking help from a lawyer tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:02:49
Definitely will!
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:24:01
It was, I'm saying their phony since they never made a deposit to my bank.

Appreciate the contact, thanks
