You have not managed to refute a single point of mine
I don't care for what you consider to be a 'tone of hatred', it has no bearing on my arguments against Bitcoin.

Actually I set up an account on Mtgox at the time (the only viable exchange back then), as I planned to buy $30 worth of BTC on the rare chance it might become worth something. I decided against it however when they requested my sensitive documents.
If I had bought that $30 worth of BTC, I would made something like $60,000 if I had sold it in December last year.
But here's the rub: Mtgox was hacked a few months later (mid 2011), and my account was compromized. If I had bought Bit coins, it would have therefore been stolen.
But even if I had somehow retained the Bitcoins, I know for a fact that I would have sold them some two years later when they reached $30-$40. I know this because I was watching the price closely at the time and in my mind I was certain I would have sold at that price.
So even if I had avoided the 2011 mtgox hack, I would have only made ~$2000 3 years later, which is peanuts to me.
The thing is that saying 'the price is up 10000000%!!!!' doesn't refute any of the points I make. What you don't realize is that when I first encountered Bitcoin back in 2010, the price had already risen tens of thousands of percent - it was, and still is, irrelevant to me though. What I concern myself with is whether it is viable in the long term, and not whether people will foolishly speculate on it or not.

Apples and oranges
Can you convert bitcoin to fiat or vice versa with the Armory cold storage wallet? If not, then its irrelevant

Have you cashed out yet?

How do you know?
This happened back in 2011

Why would I be angry? Bitcoin has done exactly as I predicted
Its down to $477 and everything around it is falling apart over time
I'm just informing people of how it is
