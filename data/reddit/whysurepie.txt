Mining with altcoins will be better than bitcoins. All of the energy your CPU/GPU uses it converted to heat, so heating a room is easy with a desktop with a couple of GPUs. Heating water probably not so easy.

AMD is one of the biggest ASIC designers in the world, and one of a few companies with the actual capacity and industry links to manufacture on a large scale.
This is the first concrete sign from them that they are supporting crypto.
This could be huge for the mining landscape. If they are willing to spend money on supporting altcoin mining, I wonder if they would be willing to do the same for Bitcoin mining. It's a massive market after all.

Probably unloading it to trade it for:
a) a more profitable coin
b) to buy back BCH when it drops.
I'm seeing a 1/10 ratio as a baseline. Higher than that and I would sell to buy back below that ratio.
Who cares about politics when trading? It's all FUD and the truth is the market cares little about big or small block vision.

I like Bitcoin too, but if you need that level of privacy it's much easier to use a crypto designed with that in mind. Solutions for Bitcoin (mixers, JoinMarket) do exist, but they all have their flaws. There are other coins that are designed with privacy in mind and are providing strong privacy today.
IMO it's healthy to have a cryptocurrency eco-system where coins fill specific niches and specialise in that area.

Nothing if you leave your coins in an address which is vulnerable.
IIRC all you need to do to be quantum safe is generate a new address, send all your coins to it, then never spend from it. Quantum attacks can only steal funds from address which have been spent from atm.

It's relevant because Bitcoin only works when it is decentralised.
Low startup costs for node operators help keep Bitcoin decentralised. I certainly wouldn't have started to run a node if I had to download a &gt;1TB blockchain, which is where ETH is heading fast.

Satoshi posted a whitepaper to a mailing list and then responded to questions about the technology and econimics of the system. He didn't "sell" anything. There was no sale or pitch in the same way that academic papers aren't sold or pitched.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:42:08
This is also the reason (some would say) why Satoshi left. His  2nd to last public post stated that wikileaks accepting bitcoin will bring the wrong kind of attention to bitcoin.
I'd rather have Satoshi posting anon on bitcoin talk than Assange bragging about how rich he is on twitter.

People trust Bitmain because they have bought 100's of miners off them over years. When you spend 100k+ with a company and they always deliver the product on time and as specified you aren't going to distrust them because of some bigotted rant on reddit about how "China is a stain on Bitcoin".

There are plenty of cryptocurrencies with low transaction fees that could be used to replace bitcoin in these use cases, and it's super easy to change between bitcoin and alt coins if you want to do that at some point (for saving, perhaps).

I have run a bitcoin node for years. It is only now that I have a bandwidth problem. I am not trying to shoehorn my "ultra slow" box into the bitcoin network, it has been part of it for years.

Would just like to add that you can easily run your own electrumx server if you are already running your own node. In this way you can preserve your privacy whilst using an SPV wallet on a mobile device, since it's not really practical to run a full node on a mobile.

Thanks for calling my post bullshit.
How does bitcoin core use 1-2KB/sec? By my maths downloading 1MB every 4 mins would use approximate 4K/second. That's just to download the block, not any unconfirmed transactions.
I fail to see how you can download a 1 MB block every 4 mins with only 1 KB/sec. It doesn't add up.

The incentives of business users and personal users of bitcoin don't really align. I regularly see people posting that we need VISA scale transaction throughput and nodes that can support that, or that their business model isn't working with bitcoin, so we should change the protocol to accomodate the 10000 0.0002 btc transactions they want to make per day.
The thing that pisses me off is the majority of these business owners who push for changes to bitcoin probably have a fat stack of fiat too. They have bank accounts, they go to corporate meetings with their loan managers. They are part of the system bitcoin is disrupting. Bitcoin is a means to acquire more fiat for them, and that's it. 
I use bitcoin everyday. I have no bank account and am fully in crypto, with no stack of fiat to fall back on. I believe that this technology will change the world for the good, and getting rich a long the way is secondary to that. Businesses don't care about the future of Bitcoin, as long as they can extract every last drop of fiat from they dying beast they will be happy. This is where the incentives clash and why you should never trust a man in a suit that is pushing for a protocol change, claiming to represent  "Satoshis Vision".

"And just because you’re not in the US doesn’t mean that this doesn’t apply to you. You might think your legislators are more progressive or informed and can see the value in not inhibiting cryptocurrency adoption. Think again. Legislators elsewhere in the world need to be made aware that bad examples like BitLicense or the ULC draft are not international best practice for regulating cryptocurrencies."
Wow, fear mongering much? Many other countries have already made legislation around bitcoin and other cryptos, and it's nothing like the draconian measures in the Bitlicense.
Yes it sucks for people in New York, but donating to a US legal cause is NOT going to help people in other countries. It's misleading to pretend it does and drumming up irrational fear is to get more donations is bullshit.

IMO Market domination is a bad metric of success in such a new and rapidly expanding market. It's pretty expected for the first movers market domination to decrease as the market matures. Furthermore, many alt coins add unique value that bitcoin simply can't replicate (see XMR and ETH).

I was hoping there might still be some 50 and 25 block rewards still sat around in their original addresses. Probably unlikely.
I want to do this to own a piece of bitcoin history. Maybe in 10 years time there will be other bitcoin collectors around and that pristine block will have extra value. If not, I will have a nice digital curousity for my collection.
Perhaps mined blocks and bought blocks are also taxed differently? I have no idea on that tbh, but could be a factor in some countries.
