I stumbled upon bitcoin on gox when it was 3$. forgot about it and ~1.5 years later saw the price at 165$. bought on libertybit and transfered to gox thinking they were safe there. Heard about accounts being hacked and troubles withdrawing. moved everything to Vault of Satoshi about 3 months ago. I am lucky I guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:10:25
100% agree, been telling all my family members the same thing. do you recommend any cold storage techniques?
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:46:48
I own the domain name bitcoinadnetwork.com. Message me if you are interested! 
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:48:17
I just got Goosebumps! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:50:08
I have been with VOS for the past 6-7 months now. I moved my bitcoins from gox to them because of the great steps they have taken to secure my account. I have to say they are the real deal! Screw cavirtex with their high fees, ugly user interface and lack of trading options. Mike from VOS has always been there to answer my questions or concerns. You guys are doing an amazing job! Not to mention I made a killing in arbitrage when you first started :) :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:18:47
Alot can happen in 76 days...
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:20:13
Free Trading feed till july 1st... I hope they can maintain their dominance afterwards. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:35:02
Yes!!! I made this happen! I was updating their website through my web design company (netlinkstudio) and I recommended Eric to give a speech on bitcoin! Stoked to have done my part! 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:51:45
Sorry CaVirtex. Me love VoS! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:38
Could be worse, some people probably have to explain to their parents why their investment disappeared with gox. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:27:05
Vos is by far the best exchange! They have tons of features, a beautiful interface and their support is phenomenal. They have all their shit in order 100%! Also. They have proof of solvency which CAvirtex does not have. this raises a big red flag. VOS all the way!!! 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:13:58
The guy has a point. Ive been selling and buying back in all the way down. Started with 3 btc, now I have 13. Today I stold 5 of them and Im about to buy in for 5.68. Don't be afraid to make moves! 
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:19:38
They can't be sold on an exchange, bitstamp has 37,000 coins buy order....
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:13:28
Just sent you .3 bitcoin. Enjoy! 
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:59:46
Ive just got 3 of my bitcoins! MTGOX IS BACKKK!!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:36:37
Its all relative... needed to make some big trades... 
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:22:08
exactly, ppl just spreading fud as usual. sub 400 is in the past!
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:24:10
If this is a real offer, I would hire a camera crew, I would sign the deal today and live the life of a bitcoin hermit! I am ready to go the  extra satoshi! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:34:46
Very touching! God bless
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:48:47
Done n done ;) back to the moon, nothing to see here folks!
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:00:45
I own the domain name bitcoinadnetwork.com ! Does someone want to buy it off me? 
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:33:57
there is... privately!
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:47:17
Vault of satoshi, by far the best there is! 
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:44:30
exchanges dont even have that much in buy orders... bitstamp ~37,000 in buy orders...
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:54:02
same shit with me, i was on vacation in spain in 2011 and i said fuck it. Biggest mistake of my life!
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:51:48
This stock is going to go much higher. A very trusted company indeed! Very excited for the future! 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:36:48
This is big!
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:17:43
Shut the fup! Bitcoin is gonnnnnnna dropppp 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:46
Could not agree more. Oh boy, already had to spend 1 hour explaining to my friends on facebook the difference between mtgox and bitcoin. Not the same thing! gonna be a long week indeed. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:48:01
Thanks for pointing that out... I also appreciate your sarcasm.
In terms of the info, its taken directly from bitcoin.org...
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:10:18
An absolute bottom... I don't think so. I can see sub 100$ prices in coming. supply is always increasing and demand is only decreasing...
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:42:35
Game changer all the way!
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:01:01
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:46:13
Hey, I have gone through a similar issue with them. I moved 2 bitcoin out of there last Monday and still, the transaction is listed as processing. I looked on their contact us page and they dont even list a real phone number! Im very concerned that they are not legitimate! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:13:34
Bitcoin Circle jerk. Every bit of new is good news no matter what..... Delusional   
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:39:59
24, Graduated John Molson School of Business in Montreal with a Major in Marketing. Found out about bitcoin in 2011, when I travelling in Spain and the price was 3$.  Was not able to buy because I was not close to a bank and had no way of getting processed. I forgot about it and then in April just after the dive I was able to buy in. Have been on the ride of my life last 6 months! I love you guyS!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:38:52
:( 
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:27:54
Did you get through to someone
@_date: 2013-06-02 22:36:20
Agreed. We will be updating it very soon!
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:51:35
The market will drop quickly once China gets up. Also the DEA is going to dump those seized coins as the gov is already shut down. They need Fiat ASAP
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:50:59
China will wake up soon and dump. Then the DEA will dump those seized coins. Watch the price drop! 
@_date: 2013-09-17 01:10:08
Now for sale! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:50:36
You can spend them on gifts from Olive Authentique. Its a small family business. I will be implementing bitcoin payment before newyears but if you want I can send you some items in exchange for bitcoin. Message me at info if you are interested. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:52:31
Good bye high prices. China is going to wake up and then Dump Dump Dump... Then the DEA Will dump those seized coins and poof! Gonna hit a new low any day now 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:08:35
I was just in the process of signing up. Can you please elaborate... 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:08:12
So Far I really like the site, Especially because of the two factor safety via email! 
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:50:32
Wait till China wakes up. The price is sure to Drop. Plus the DEA Will dump those seized coins to get their cash right away (the gov is shutdown)
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:25:01
I'm only trying to get some of the new comers who lost money buying in high, that there is hope things will look good in the future....
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:07:31
That bites, Im still waiting, no response to my two tickets. I guess I just need to cross my fingers im not out 2 bitcoin... 
@_date: 2013-06-02 23:01:33
Thanks for the advice. We will update the chart with less obscure words and highlight the benefits.
@_date: 2013-06-02 23:11:38
This has given me a great idea for our website, thebitcoiners.com. We will add a section in our intro to bitcoins on how to accept payments. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:29:09
Pardon my grammar, it was never my strength.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:14:02
Yes, yes it is. Go home now. Nothing to see here...
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:58:55
Sounds good, Need to spend some time with the family but on Monday we shall discuss! 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:33:22
HELLO EVERYONE! I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS. I GOT MY TWO BITCOINS BACK. 
I reported this problem long before everyone else so its only a matter of time till you get yours back! 
MUCH LOVE!  
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:59:14
I think this idea is brilliant! 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:56:14
Seriously, I have 2 bitcoin in limbo since 3 weeks now. My brother has 5 bitcoin in limbo. This is totally uncool! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:16:06
So rich he is about to tip me a bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:21:21
I donno what to say, I took 2 bitcoins out on the 22nd and no luck... two support tickets and plenty of complaining 
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:56:50
hmmm beginning of last month... and my brother got his later as he withdrew at a later time. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:36:00
I agree. I hope you found the other sub forum (I dont want to mention it here in fear of tainting it with these tards) When I first heard of bitcoin was all I knew. Every time I traded I lost money. Since finding hope in the new forum (r/XXwillnottellanyonexxx) I have quadrupled my income. Fuck r/bitcoin and the circle jerk it is! 
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:31:53
I will be there! 
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:28:45
My brother tried removing transferring 5 bitcoin out of there this morning and no luck. Its been over 48 hours. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:24:05
Not at all, orders go through very quickly. I ve made a ton of money trading on here. Lots of noobs 
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:56:04
Yes, I contacted support and filed a ticket. No response. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:21:46
I agree that getting a 3-5% discount could be a very good thing. However your point regarding the fact that the prices continue to go up so you should hold bitcoin is false, because if prices keep going up no one would want to spend them, thus having them as a payment system wont work (people will just hold).

You may use our text and images. Can we see it when you're done?

There is a startup build a bill payment software. The startup is in the incubator at the montreal bitcoin embassy.

Not to worry, It took 3 weeks to have my coins delivered to me. My brother and I had 7 coins in limbo...
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:40:06
WHERE ARE MY DAMN BITCOINS! 
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:37:06
You are absolutely right. Update incoming.
Edit: Updated the chart.
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:33:43
Man, wait till china starts to do a small dump and the DEA dumps the millions in seized coins 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:52:09
Currently beta testing...
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:28
I needed that, almost panicked today... 
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:49:43
I don't see why this would make any difference. There seemed to be an error that occurred. Usually its automatic. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:12:17
Just added you, Been so caught up in this rally... 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:28:58
My brother and I had 7btc combined. It took 3 weeks but we got them...
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:50:23
Wait till China wakes up. The price is sure to Drop. Plus the DEA Will dump those seized coins to get their cash right away (the gov is shutdown)
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:14:39
Oh, excellent. I can see the market correcting from your amazing news! 
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:55:44
Seriously, I dont have as many bitcoins in this mess but its more than I wish to lose considering I don`t have many to begin with... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:24:33
Acceptance and denial from tiny countries. This is CHINA! 
People think india will save them but india has much smaller income! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:10:16
Vault of Satoshi is also a great exchange. It has very low fees and you can easily deposit cash from BMO directly into it. The downside is there is low volume however this is very appealing for Canadians looking to sell some bitcoin as you can get much higher prices!  
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:36:42
Thant's great! Im on a mission as well to get new users into Bitcoins. Me and my buddies have started the website thebitcoiners.com. We are going to be publishing daily articles, how to guides and resources! Feel free to check it out and give me your opinion. It's really the basics of bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-11-18 04:57:55
Dont risk it. Ive lost about 1/10 of my stash fooling around. I got lucky playing crypto stocks on LTC-Global when someone had a call option below the market price, I swooped in and turned 300$ into 1300$ in less than 2 minutes with 0 risk! It was very thrilling :)
