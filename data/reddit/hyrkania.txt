Only the married ones.

Not really.
Name one positive thing about marriage that doesn’t come from long term commitment without contract law.
Marriage literally adds nothing but punitive measures for breach of contract.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:46:09
It’s concrete proof that one or both felt trapped by legal obligations and probably didn’t let you know the full picture.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:35:01
You still haven’t named something positive that comes from marriage.  Instead you just keep saying “marriage works”.  How?  What does it provide?
What does marriage afford of value that a non-marriage monogamous relationship based on respect, love, and trust doesn’t?  What is the net good that comes out of marriage, a monogamous relationship based solely on contract law?
Marriage provides precisely one “advantage” over non-marriage.  The potential for punitive measures and civil action for alleged breach of contract.
“Oh darling, we are perfect together, I love you and respect you, and always will, as long as you sign this agreement giving me legal recourse if you ever break the terms of our contractual union.”
So fucking romantic.  Sounds like marriage is a relationship minus the trust.
Keep in mind I wasn’t burned by my divorce.  My divorce was the best fucking thing that happened to me.  The courts awarded me a net $100,000 due to her infidelity, documented physical abuse, and the criminal complaints I had filed since separation due to her harassment and stalking.

Some of us did.
I was married to an abusive sociopath for almost 20 years.
Marriage is a sham.

Why does sticking around through cancer require marriage?  Sounds like you’ll only do that if they and you sign up for mutual bondage and slavery.  Not really love IMO.
I’m talking about marriage, yes.  Artificial permanent legal commitment via contract law.

I'm asking for reasoned argument, not anecdote without full comprehension.
And who says I'm weeping in sadness?  I'm having a blast.
And thousands of people marry, 2.3 million every year are raped or assaulted by their spouse, over 50% of all marriages end in divorce, and many more should with victims of domestic violence taking, on average, seven attempts to leave before extracting themselves from violence.

What is the benefit of marriage?
No one has yet been able to offer a concrete benefit.
My position is: “Marriage is sometimes bad.”  I couple this with “Marriage never offers concrete benefits beyond cohabitation.”
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:54:36
B-B-Bullshit.  If you dispute my definition offer a new one, with proper justification for your definition over mine.
All you are doing is admitting defeat by resorting to fallacy.  Engage the material and hypothesis I’ve advanced, or admit you are wrong.

Why is marriage “an awesome thing”?
As someone who went through a 20 year abusive marriage... I don’t see a single god damned upside.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:17:02
I’m saying marriage isn’t proof of love and resolve, nor a requirement for it.
Why is this so controversial?
Marriage is two drunk people getting contractually bound by a dude dressed as Elvis in Reno.
Marriage is Donald Trump’s contractual obligation to his soviet handler, and her obligation to let him rape her when he momentarily overcomes his diabetic impotence.
That’s the union you are defending.
I’m saying it means nothing.
Commitment and marriage aren’t correlated.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:17:44
Why take the risk?
Marriage takes two.  If you put in the effort and your partner didn’t.   You lose.
If you both put in effort... what’s the upside?
Just date.  Move on when appropriate.  Why is commitment a good thing?  It just gives the less altruistic of you a pass to get lazy.
Being realistic that either party can and should walk keeps everyone on their best behavior.  It also respects the autonomy and decision of each party by not trying to apply legal shackles.

They would have been less happy if they hadn’t bound each other legally with contract law?
What’s particularly joyous about contract binding?
If they have always been blissful and happy, why couldn’t they have enjoyed each other’s company in a long term relationship based on mutual respect and love, instead of one based on contract law?

This is an excellent summary of marriage!  Thanks!
"I love you, but I don't trust you, unless you sign this document giving me legal recourse for breach of contract.  I don't trust you enough to cohabitate unless you sign this document giving me civil complaint should I be displeased by your conduct.  I am so certain I cannot trust you I require the full force of law to be at my disposal, because I without that, I do not consent to further commitment."
That's marriage.  Precisely.
Long term relationships without marriage are entirely about mutual trust and respect.  All marriage does is involve the state because you don't trust your partner.


Love.  Trust.  Respect.  A marriage might have any of these.  But the only thing it needs is a contract which is enforceable by the courts.


That's my opinion, but why you think "doing it right" must necessarily involve the court system is fucking beyond me.


The only thing we've talked about that is an unholy abomination of distrust is marriage.  My way doesn't require the court system to also be involved. 
Yours?  Does.


Which is why you create a living will and trust.  Mine grants 50% of my estate to my parents, 10% to my sibling, and 40% to my girlfriend.


And yet that is precisely what marriage is.  Involving the courts in your life because you're afraid of the future and require contract law to mediate your relationship's forseeable breakdown.  If this wasn't the case, you wouldn't need to bind your partner legally to an enforceable contract.


No.  That would be the situation with my girlfriend.  Either one of us could walk.  I paid off her loans because I love her, and trust her, and respect her.  I have no legal guarantee she won't walk away tomorrow.  I trust her, love her, and respect her, that's all we have.  
You are your wife have it hard.  Everything is both yours and hers, but not because you love, trust, and respect each other.  Because the state and court system says it is.  Marriage is the abdication of trust, love, and respect, and the direct involvement of the legal system to mediate your personal relationship.
That is the abomination.

Your logic is weak.
All you have to do is make a counter argument.  You’ve instead opted to deflect.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:28:23
No, real life (for most of us) is about belief based in facts, and adjusted by data and observation.
I was a marriage supporter until my current gf walked me through her logical beliefs.
I'm challenging you to support marriage with facts, and you can't.

Why mix assets?
I get some people are illogically driven to breed, but leaving that out... why?
Keep assets logically divided and split costs if you feel driven to cohabitate.
And common law marriage isn’t a thing anymore.  Only nine states recognize it.

I’m not worried so much about the prospect of divorce - I’m divorced myself, happily.  I initiated after 20 years of abuse.  I’m worried about marriage, or more specifically, young people getting duped into contract slavery with literally no upside.  All marriage does is bind two people together so the more asshole of the two of you can exploit and manipulate the other.
Sure, you might be married to a true altruist.  You might also win the lottery, or discover a portal to a dimension of infinite magic.  Anything can happen.  It just isn’t likely.
Marriage is just a bad decision, with literally no possible upside.

Name one reason why commitment is a good thing.
You act like commitment is the obvious end game.  News flash - it isn’t.  You’re just not questioning societies values, which is hilarious as fuck for this sub.  You obviously don’t accept fiat as the be all end all.
Apply the same analysis to commitment.
