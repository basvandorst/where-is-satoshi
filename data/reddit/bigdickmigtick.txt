Whats the point then?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:22:28
So bitcoin is the linux of crypto?

Try to buy a coffee with physical usd, a visa card, bitcoin, and bcash.
3 of the 4 coffee would be about the same price, and one over 25$.
Bitcoin is becoming more and more a speculative store of value than a good currency. But yeah it's still a cryptocurrency, just not good at its job atm.

This is kind of cruel but its true.

My point was that there is nothing of value behind crypto, and anyone can creat it out of thin air, like paper money.
So it is capital created out of nothing.

Well I was answering your last sentence, not the post.
And for bitcoin 2.0 there are a lot of alt that are better in therm of speed, privacy and fees, at this point bitcoin only have its brand name and recognition that makes it so pricey.
But yeah, its not tomorrow that ppl will stop giving a shit about bitcoin, but it may be in some years if it's not properly improved.

And money is printed with paper and ink.

Crypto are created out of nothing.

Did I say bitcoin? I said cryptocurrencies in general.
Anyway, if tomorrow ppl decided to not give a shit about bitcoin, it would have no value left, same goes for paper money.
Now if you look at gold for exemple, if ppl would stop giving a shit about it, it would still have value due to its necessity in the industry etc, we can't just decide that now plastic is gold. 
But we can decide to use another crypto or paper money instead of the actual popular one.

How knows

Doubling the total amount of a coin would lower its price, maybe. (I think it was zcash changed the supply without the price dropping accordingly)
Anyway, market cap=total amount of coins * coin price.

Its not because it is used that it is the best solution.
