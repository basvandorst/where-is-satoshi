Some morons like to measure volume in USD instead of BTC.

Someday you will understand.

Maybe someone just wanted the sheep to make that guess.

CO2 poisoning? Is that similar to H2O poisoning?
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:06:08
Your must be right! There is no possible way to lose!

The question isn't resolved. It will continue to happen until someone is proven to be Nakamoto.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:05:46
I wonder if these two guys are planning on opening their own exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:02:13
Your a young naive child.
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:03:33
Id start trading in your bitcoins for doge while the ratio is still good.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:27:46
If Satoshi was killed and his bitcoins lost I'd bet at least half of would only be thinking how the price of their .5 bitcoins will be affected.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:34:16
If the price stabilizes at $1 bitcoin might finally have a chance to succeed.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:45
I had 5k DOGE, but gambled them all away.
When they are worth $1200 each I will be pissed!
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:42:36
I'll take my coin at $1.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:25:31
If dorian is not satoshi and satoshi is truly concerned then you are right, satoshi will need to reveal himself.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:35:51
BTW, my dogecoins have been doing great lately. Much better investment then bitcoins, right? When people start heading twords an exit you will see their true value.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:51:04
It could go up 100000x. If the volume isn't there to support someone selling without the price plummeting it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:06:07
Or "bitcoin continues to fluctuate 20% over a few hours."
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:47:12
I think the real joke with dogecoin is that it is superior to bitcoin on a technical level, but is treated so badly by much of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:32:14
I think the idea is that you now should spend your bitcoins on overstock.com.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:58:19
You probably own a few bitcoins and have $$$ is your eyes. My guess is a lot of younger people are going to get a harsh lesson in liquidity soon.
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:50:14
I measure my doges in satoshis. I'm way ahead of this game.

And big time profit margin.
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:51:39
Bitcoins price in USD is primarily determined by circle jerk. If circle jerk fades so will bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:14
Big deal, bitcoin price drops to $10, emergency changes are made to keep the miners working, bitcoin continues functioning as well as it ever has.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:28:17
People should be reporting this bot to reddit. Terrible idea.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:27:07
You asked "who does that?" Apparently silk road 2 and many others.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:28:10
I see contains many software engineers who once worked at mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:52:20
By the end of the month it may be only $800 or so.

You must be pretty eager to sell your bitcoins. Why else would you be so concerned about its price this week or next.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:51:04
Well I guess 98% of their bitcoin into USD isn't 100%.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:02:15
is already up to 45,000. Will it soon have more?
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:04:21
Problem solved: 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:36:13
If they did that then the people that have funds on mtgox would complain that they should at least be able to trade.

"making the markets uneasy." lol, good thing i dont need to worry about such silly things
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:40:50
When bitcoin settles at a dollar per coin this won't be an issue.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:33:32
I get it. Invest $100 a day in bitcoin and you can't lose! We will all be rich!

Nothing he said is untrue.
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:18:19

Where is the proof they did?
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:03:36
They won't sell them on an exchange, but if whoever buys them gets them for a cheaper price then what they are sell for on some exchange they may just flip them for a quick profit.
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:45:51
Make sure they know of some gambling sites when you are handing them out. I don't know what else they are going to do with so little btc.

Well if the price falls to $100 next week you might see things differently.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:19:01
If I owned any bitcoins I'd be concerned that so many people here on seem a bit eager to sell theirs. So worried about what is presumably a short term dip.

Does this mean that mtgox is kindly spreading bitcoin wealth? This should help all those charts that show the distrbution.

Yes. I moved my 13.3PH yesterday.
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:59:16
I know. Hopefully this will stop the Canadian manipulators holding the price down.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:34:59
I have a similar feeling. However that is completely unrelated to bitcoins fate.

Where will the price be next week? Ill check back in 1 week to see if you are full of shit or not.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:34:22
Good. Please ELI3.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:41:35
If they get over 51% then can they guarantee their miners get paid for 100% of the blocks?
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:51:09
Clearly they aren't interest in selling hardware.

An attack will probably come from 2, 3, or more pools working together. Doubtful anyone will notice until its too late.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:22:51

A glimpse of wisdom from @_date: 2014-01-14 19:24:40
Clearly that is going to happen at some point. Would you rather have it happen now, or later?
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:46:24
This isn't an attack. It's a free market at work.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:47:09
Is it normal to see the level of circle jerk here or did something bad just happen?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:37:23
Strength in numbers.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:05:02
Bitcoin is saved!
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:44:20
If they get over 51% of the hashing power can they guarantee their miners get paid for 100% of the blocks?
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:50:03
If you give me 100 million in bitcoins I'm going to sell all of them because I believe their value is not going up, it's going to go down. If I believed it was going up I certainly would not sell them.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:34:21
Anyone with over a tenth of a bitcoin think they are going to be retiring on it. Why would they tip away their future?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:54:14
Don't sell. Save that 0.05. Soon enough that will be all your need for retirement.
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:50:45
At the current prices 1 "internet" or $0.25 would be 135 doge. This is a common tip on People are tipping 200, 2000 or more doge in all day long.

It's probably just the other half of ghash.io.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:40:09
Does the person who created bitcoin enjoy seeing others go through this? Why doesn't the Nakamoto who created bitcoin just reveal himself? Is is anonymity worth the suffering of others?
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:47:48
Id assume so, but don't let that cloud your support for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:07:55
Lets say I want to send $200 through bitcoin every other week from the USA to Mexico. What sort of fees and delay would I expect between having the cash in my hand here in the USA, and my family member having their cash in Mexico.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:18:35
Bitcoin's life is not dependent its price. It still work no different at $10 then it does at $1000 per bitcoin.
The only people suffering will be those people that think hording bitcoin is a good investment.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:32:03
Buying and holding bitcoin is more likely to give you a heart attack then make you rich.

@_date: 2014-04-15 14:47:41
New merchants shouldn't even be tolerated. Once they receive bitcoins they just sell them for dollars! Not only are these corporations selling our precious bitcoins for a fraction of their actual worth, they are also allowing more bitcoins to be sold.

Does the mtgox price matter or not? I'm confused.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:03:56
Guys, the only chance you have to get your bitcoins back is if mtgox goes back online and people use it. That way mtgox can earn their commission and use it to repay their debts.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:13:40
Your not going to change any minds writing such a biased article.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:20:07
You are so wrong...
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:58:16
Lately that it only goes up in price.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:56:41
You you could end up dying and never get anything from your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:18:33
Sorry but bit bitcoins don't feed employees or manufacturer new hardware.
Most big miners sell all there coins.
They won't be there ones holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:18:24
We will be one step closer once we realize all the issues faced by bitcoin cash are also faced by bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:36:57
The only legitimate reason I see for not supporting 2x is to try to keep that space limited and create demand for off-chain products. They know they can't beat the Chinese miners for that revenue, so are trying this instead.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:14:55
Tulip bulbs. Tulips are living things. Much more advanced than a bitcoin. That's what makes them such a good investment.
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:18:02
Maybe I dont quite understand the lightning network. But the way I do understand it is that although anyone can create nodes, only the well connected nodes mean anything. In a way it's sort like now anyone can create a crypto yet at the same time all of wants bitcoin to the top dog. Essentially centralization by consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:25:05
It's possible but something could replace them.
If you are making that argument you could go farther and ask how we would be screwed if the internet itself is lost.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:16:25
If you got a leveraged position of AMD stock you could have made even more.
There is literally countless ways you could have made more money starting with the $2000 during that time.

I'm predicting a stop at $100,000 before falling to $70,000 then rocketing to $700,000.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:46:59
A genius?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:26:45
And isn't that a major part of running a full node?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:15:58
Sounds like they have the solution to the bandwidth required for big blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:26:21
Thats the punchline. The joke is coming.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:02:01
They are not lost forever. In the future if someone wants to calculate the private keys they will have the technology. Cryptology and computer power is always advancing but the relationship between old private and public keys will never change.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:22:22
Those $5 fees will quickly add up to more than the number of all bitcoins * 1000 dollars.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:07:32
Yea, just like on-chain transactions are instant and virtually free.
These things are being made to make a buck. Do you think people are investing money into them to save you guys a few bucks on your transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:13:49
Capitalist pigs!
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:53:11
So would you be ok with destroying 40% of the coins just to make sure they can't be taken over?
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:52:55
I'm sure many people thought they were going to retire off them.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:26:11
The end of bitcoin is near! Long live segwitcoin!.
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:45:43
Is it feasible a quantum computer, advance in mathematics or cryptography, etc would let someone in the future calculate a private key given a public key? And if so won't they be able to move all the old coins mined at the start of bitcoin?
Assuming the coins are never moved I don't see what could ever be done about that besides making those coins inaccessible to anyone with the original keys.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:52:56
You bitcoin vending machine?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:46:38
They feel segwit destroys bitcoin and they are attempting to save it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:15:00
By keeping the block size small you can keep on-chain transactions relatively expensive and create demand for off-chain products.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:47:29
Finding a hash that matches some pattern typically isn't some sort of problem where you can try all the inputs and there is only one solution.
Typically there are infinite solutions but they are spread out. Maybe one in a million million guesses generates the pattern you are looking for.
I don't know the specifics of bitcoin. But its possible that the odds of two miners randomly pick the same input is astronomically unlikely.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:20:01
Unless coinbase is really shady it should be pretty easy to access his account. This stuff literally happens every single day.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:25:21
Only so many transactions fit into a block
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:21:46
Exactly what lightning network code?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:17:25
What happens to mining fees after segwit, ln, and all the other promised software.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:26:02
Those satellites are only sending messages down to earth. Nothing going up.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:09:16
How do you trade with these fees? Or do you have your own lightning network of IOU notes?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:16:10
Lots of Hope and waiting.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:58:01
It's a method miners can use to possibly increase their effective hashing power without buying more hardware. However there is a patent on it.
Who is and isn't using it is up to debate.
Some people want to change bitcoin so that it no longer works. Others don't care or want to keep it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:51:22
Absolute shitcomment.
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:15:25
What are saying? Bitcoin worth is measured in the effort to mine?
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:27:20
So those are ATMs?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:53:11
You mean this: 
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:55:07
But there are many magic inputs. They are trying to be the first to find any of them.
How many inputs generate a has that starts with "00", how bout "0000000000000". 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:13:52
They have the resources to take over all mining for any crypto if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:50:15
It could be at $100 and be mainstream. 1% of the coins being traded back and forth at $10,000 means nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:36:11
Swap BTC for mining equipment. You aren't powerless you know.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:53:14
I have access to a list of all the private keys. I own all bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:19:16
I am a programmer and rely on many open source projects. However it's hard to ignore the relationship between core and blockstream.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:13:55
You could do that right now, whats stopping you?
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:29:16
Those seem to be made for a completely different purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:56:26
What are you afraid of? Just think of all the coins you could buy if the price fell to $500.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:07:39
I think he means does it really matter for this pump.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:25:14
Yea. Also it would be nice to see bitcoin cash included.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:51:27
You don't sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:53:57
They could be saving you from yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:55:00
I'm sure the developers would be majorly disappointed if their code got replaced.
This is really a battle between the miners business model and the business models of off-chain products like liquid and lightning. There isn't enough revenue to support both.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:54:12
You don't. Why do you think the price is so high?
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:12:18
Getting played like a fiddle.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:28:29
Fear of covert asicboost is going to kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:50:44
Larger blocks would help and technologies like this enable it.
But there simply isn't enough money to be made through mining and off-chain products.
Bitcoin was once about the technology and empowering people. Now it's about making a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:45:57
One thing I don't understand is if fees are going down and block rewards are going down how are miners going to get their cut?
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:31:10
Sorry for you guys without a 'Friends of Kraken' account.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:53:40
Why doesn't this chart go back farther?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:10:00
IMO we will see machines and software powerful enough to calculate the private keys off all the oldest bitcoins before we see any sort of widespread adoption.
And if it did happen after adoption it would be a disaster.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:26:18
Did I say free?
"Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world."
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:51:05
I think he was implying they don't actually have the bitcoins so obviously don't have the keys. So they need to buy them.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:35:00
Well all thought bitcoin would implode once it got over a few hundred.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:39:53
You made it sound so easy. You should certainly do it!
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:05:28
Good thing we have these guys to tell us exactly what to do.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:06:13
I know right? Easy money. No possible way to lose!
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:09:09

Thats fine. Segwit2x would have been what appeared to be an acceptable compromise between the miners and the off chain business models. But like I said some people don't feel there is enough revenue to share. So instead there is going to be a battle.

Deleting your keys would be just as effective.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:59:12
It does. But it's possible while mining you are calculating the sha256 of fixed values. For example you calculate the sha256 of the block once and use that value while mining.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:44:32
And all bitcoin users can depend on them.

Credit card networks are easier to use and faster. There is little value bothering to pay via bitcoin.
And from a technical standpoint many other cryptos are a few steps ahead of bitcoin for scaling and speed.

It would be pretty trivial for them to take whatever percent of the hashing power they would like.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:04:23
Nowhere is Liquid or Blockstream mentioned. Your not going to change any minds writing such a biased article.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:03:13
It was cheap till it stopped being about the tech and starting being about making a buck.
Segwit, LN, etc are only means to move revenue from miners to off chain companies.

Are you saying it's impossible?
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:43:33
Bitcoins price makes even less sense. Has all those weaknesses and is 10x the price.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:18:25
Thats what the sidechain companies want you to believe.

Around $100. Maybe sometime next week.

Never sell. Only buy.
Till one day you need to trade it in for something useful.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:18:08
They probably want to keep the 1 MB competitive to force users to adopt side chain products so that the owners can funnel the revenue back to the the developers.

No, just buy. Always buy and never sell.

@_date: 2017-07-26 13:30:36
Or the year that Bitcoin imploded and Ethereum took it's place.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:47:20
When comparing gold, bitcoin, and a mode advanced crypto such as ethereum why would I choose bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:48:32
Fork is a bad word.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:21:50
Moving the profits always from the miners and into the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:11:57
Finally the cult of bitcoin users can catch up a bit with their premined altcoin. Sounds like a win.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:21:57
In a world without morons wouldn't exist.

So bitcoin has become the new tulips. Gotcha.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:05:19
The sign said buy bitcoin, not sell bitcoin. Isn't this auction against his message?
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:18:06
Happy to include those coins in the "market cap" of bitcoin. Not happy if they might actually be used. Sounds like @_date: 2017-07-27 14:22:45
Bitcoin quite pumped and nearly ripe for the dump.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:34:35
Classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:04:43
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:52:49
One last chance to hold the bags.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:54:15
Welcome to the future.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:03:31
I don't own any cryptos right now. Bad times are coming.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:16:35
Your not suppose to spend your bitcoins silly!
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:42:16
Millennials aren't going to show much interest for something if it isn't on an iphone or a console.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:43:34
That's not safe.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:10:43
Not just mining from now to the split, but all past bitcoin mining. So all BCC is effectively premined.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:09:33
Come up with your own, better, optimization and profit.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:41:28
Aren't the miners the central authority?
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:14:13
Market cap is only part of the picture. As far as I know bitcoins liquidity is much lower than any of those companies.
For example how much would bitcoin's price drop if I sold a millon dollars worth of coins vs. nikes stock drop if I sold a million dollars worth of nike stock.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:31:15
Overall if BCH goes up BTC is probably going down and if BCH goes down then BTC is going up.
The only way you are coming out behind is if people are selling BCH and leaving bitcoin entirely.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:04:49
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:15:58
Can someone delete this post? Don't want the sheeple of believing this.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:08:19
Isn't the freedom to choose the most important thing? Yet the cult of bitcoin wants you to believe there are no other options.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:54:44
Yea I know the odds. I'm just asking if the coins are legally both of ours till one of us moves them.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:19:57
The prophecy was true!
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:43:13

Nope. You can only HODL.

You: 
Them: 
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:49:27
So can other cryptos that don't include all of bitcoin's baggage.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:42:29
The low number of different people trading bitcoin is probably what brought the price up.
Such low liquidity is the reason the price is so volatile.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:54:18
Price levels out. Moves around a bit. Plummets near the end of the month.
Many BabyRage.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:56:50
You gotta think of the bigger picture. He only needs 1 bitcoin. I've been told in 5 years it will be priceless.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:56:08
As far as I know dollars in and dollars out are all that matters. So if you bought $5000 of BTC and sold the BTC $500 and the BCH for $4500 it would be a wash.
If you sold $5000 of blood over a year that would also be $5000 of income.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:33:49
Why are cell phones assumed to be safe?
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:02:46
They aren't counting all the coins owned by satoshi. Pretty good idea.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:52:42
Obviously cause the Chinese won't stop till they have all our money.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:05:54
$37B and falling. Much lower if you don't count all the coins satoshi and other mined the start. You know the coins nobody expects to be actually spent (so shouldn't actually exist).
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:16:43
It seems like you want to be against a premined crypto but when faced with one your ok with it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:23:20
$100 of bitcoin will buy you a small island in a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:42:07
I have a deal for all of you who feel bitcoin cash is worthless. I'm offering 1 priceless BTC for only 1000 worthless BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:44:19
If people buy both they will both go up. But that seems unlikely.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:35:21
The devil stirs! What out kiddos!
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:32:32
Suspicious as in any one of them could crash the price to below $100?
The current value is the only suspicious thing I see.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:13:14
Satoshi figured out a way to distribute the trust between miners but all the power is collectively in their hands.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:25:59
It could reach $50k or $0.05.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:12:00
Segwit shows the price matter more than the technology. Which is why bitcoin will ultimately fail.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:04:23
Buy low sell high. Thats how I bought bitcoin when it was $0.00001 per coin and sold when it was $4000 per coin.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:18:57
Buy cheap or sell overpriced? You decide.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:29:11
And they will do the same with their BTC.
edit: Downvotes aren't going to hide the obvious.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:30:44
When you say Litecoin I assume you mean Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:31:33
A bit disingenuous in regards to dogecoin. Dogecoin wasn't premined like this crypto will be.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:20:52
Soon enough everyone will see where the power lies.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:09:46
Yes it would. But the people who benefit from the premine would never tell you that.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:50:52
The name is only temporary. Soon it will may be called 'Bitcoin' and what is now Bitcoin will be called 'Bitcoin Classic'.
Kinda weird since BCC is more classic.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:00:43
As far as I know there is no segwit aug 1st. Seems like a lot of people are being bamboozled.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:03:49
You can't borrow me 10 btc? I'll pay you back 15 btc in 3 weeks.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:06:18
One persona can easily set the price if the volume is low. See bitcoin as an example.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:46:55
It dropped from 3k to 1.8k for no apparent reason (nothing changed). It can easily drop to below a thousand if something bad does happen.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:11:37
Exchanges are going to love if bitcoin drops to nothing and bcc goes to the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:54:23
What if you want to bet on it going down.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:00:20
So you're saying I need to buy bitcoin to sell and later buy it back.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:58:00
If math alone determines ownership then it would be legally mine.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:56:31
I could get much better returns buying a lottery ticket.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:15:08
Doesn't matter what you buy in at if you never flip it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:09:11
They are too busy 'living in the future' to be bothered to think what they missing.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:39:12
And the result is exactly the same as any other sort of premined crypto. Am I missing some key difference?
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:18:51
XXX is even quite likely. XX would be interesting.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:32:01
Makes zero sense. Litecoin and many other can do everything bitcoin can, but better.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:39:37
It still has another 2000 or so left to go.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:40:25
Cause you should be buying as I quietly sell.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:27:35
Is this anything like a relative getting kidnapped and telling the family its up to them if the person gets killed or not?
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:59:00


Proof? Without proof we could also say relies on lies to spread his opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:32:41
The only difference between bitmain and hodrs is bitmain is willing to invest while hodrs only want to wait.

It will never be as simple as buy this product to guarantee profits.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:41:36
Nope. Quickly drops to $600 before everyone decides to move to BCC and BTC falls to pennies.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:36:32
I've seen one person mentioned a few times for getting into wallets with lost passwords on @_date: 2017-07-11 18:59:16
Keep buying folks! People still have coins to sell!
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:02:51
Isn't that why segwit2x is promising? Core dev exodus?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:39:33
I think Satoshi would care most about the transactions while you care most about the price. Your are not anything like Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:59:45
Or possibly a panic sell and buy into a different crypto.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:15:56
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:59:00
Why is that.
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:47:44
Miners are Chinese. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:25:41
I could go buy 7 of these:
and have 21TB for about $490.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:44:33
Where can I short it?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:42:26
How many bitcions are gone forever and still counted in bitcoin's "market cap." And if we include those why don't we include all coins yet to be mined.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:53:13
I'm willing to share this part: 1
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:57:30
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:14:45
I know right. These rookies make one mistake with a crypto and lose everything. Shame on them!
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:09:55
It's good to see a few people here have taken their heads out of the clouds.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:22:12
If there is significantly more demand for bitcoin the price should go up.
But it's just as likely people who sell BCH will also be selling BTC to buy back whatever altcoin they were in before.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:51:33
I can't wait till it reaching $1,000,000 per coin. Going to buy a house with my 0.001 btc.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:26:48
Is it really the worst?
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:41:40
We are just waiting for the person with the billion dollar idea to come along and give it away for the good of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:07:32
Just the power to put transactions in a certain order?
The miners collectively have much more power than that. Think of the worst 50%+ attack you can come up with. Collectively the miners could do any of those things and much more.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:37:43
You mean not enough coins being traded. Same reason it goes down fast and can go down to $200 at any moment.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:08:18
Seems like a lot of work for nothing gained.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:22:34
So I'm not quite sure why you are saying they don't have power. They basically control bitcoin.
The users have the power of choice. The problem is many of them both worship and hate what bitcoin actually is.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:09:23
By design
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:42:14
You're making it sound like a cult.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:43:46
So you are saying it's going to cost hundreds of dollars per byte to add a transaction. Can't wait!
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:25:33
Their products are so good they must be evil! Banish them! Quickly!
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:11:23
Nice try Alex.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:59:02
In that case you still haven't gained any money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:27:22
IMO HODLing creates long term volatility.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:53:14
At any time someone could come up with some breakthrough.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:56:41
I'd prefer the terse reply. Not only does it save me from wasting my time watching trying to watch a video when I have no sound, but it also proves you might have some clue what you are talking about.
Anyone can post a link to youtube and say they are right or someone else is wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:20:35
Also, you haven't gained any money if you didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:29:33
So they are evil cause you made a few assumptions?
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:01:07
How many more empty blocks? If it's significant it's not really covert. Is there any statistically analysis on who is using it?
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:37:55
My understanding is it's a pool, not a queue. If you pay less than 20 you may never get confirmed if there are always enough new transactions worth more than yours.
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:16:40
Less and less decentralized
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:50:04
That's the type of game you are playing by trying to eliminate asicboost.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:58:52
I think your proving his point.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:59:33
A lower bitcoin price would fix all these issues.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:08:58
Bitcoin was designed to put all the power in the hands of miners. Don't hold bitcoins if you don't agree with the miners. The world is full of other options.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:31:19
How does it make any sense for him to short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:02:04
What's the problem with asicboost?
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:29:55
The level of hysteria in this subreddit is off the charts.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:52:23
No I didn't ignore him. It's completely understand why they would resist losing asicboost. It's the same reason others would resist a completely change to the pow.
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:12:57
If you did that bitcoins market cap would collapse.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:33:54
Probably closer to $500. Beyond that who knows.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:59:37
Your words have no meaning.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:02:04
Too complicated for you to explain?
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:08:47
I found a file that contains everyones private keys.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:49:41
Why not take your profits and buy back later? I don't get this never sell mentality.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:14:29
It may be random. But there is some relationship between the private and public key.
But there isn't much to say since you're clearly an expert.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:37:13
One reason people buy into bitcoin is it is supposedly secured by cryptology. Yet somehow asicboost poses a threat? If so that would be a flaw in one of the fundamental principles bitcoin was created from.
People will continue finding better ways to mine. Will the response to asicboost be applied to future innovations? Taking this route seems to lead down a road where politics trumps engineering.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:21:59
No kidding. Everyone knows only the chinese should bother mining.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:28:25
You can buy but not sell bitcoins at kiosks.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:24:21
I downvoted.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:00:25
Heres someones attempt at explaining asicboost: 
Yes there is plenty of incentive there. IMO they should just change the entire PoW. Make it memory bound or some other method to make it more resistant to ASICs.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:17:52
After the 1st you will suddenly own twice the number of coins. How can you lose them with a transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:57:46
Trying to spend you bitcoins? LOL
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:37:11
Because bitcoin could still end the year down.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:59:56
You posted a link to a 1 hour powerpoint. Great way to communicate an idea.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:27:45
Why not just completely change the proof of work. That would be fair to everyone.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:54:56
Do you even lift bro?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:37:15
Your making a great case for the usefulness of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:33:24
Can we get a graph like this for dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:56:39
Welcome to the future!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:28:35
Not really
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:08:25
Why would he rebuy? Doesn't he run a business that mines bitcoins? I assume he needs to pay a lot of people that don't take bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:51:54
Someone should do one on trying to sell your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:23:00
No no. It goes fiat -&gt; btc -&gt; ltc -&gt; eth -&gt; btc -&gt; fiat -&gt; doge -&gt; btc -&gt; eth -&gt; fiat.
Much more demand.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:43:58
IMO it's still quite high. But who knows. I think a lot of stocks are priced just as bad.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:29:52
What elements do you consider useful?
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:56:30
And cross their fingers anything happens after they send the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:50:39
This and the HODL mentality is why many of feel bitcoin is a ponzi.
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:14:54
Bitcoins and other cryptos have tons of liquidity. Nothing to see here. Move along please.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:02:39
Probably depends on how much gold.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:35:35
Providing keys exposes you to more risk. Why bother.
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:57:26
I'm suggesting the proof of work should be changed. It would be a fair way to eliminate asicboost.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:46:57
The changes they are justified being cautious over.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:56:59
There won't be enough dollars to measure a single bitcoin against. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:46:15
A few hours.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:45:16
Is there something inherently wrong with asicboost? From my point of view it looks like just another advance like going from cpu to gpu or gpu to asic.
Why single them out? Why can't anyone come up with better technology?
So if you want asicboost to be gone and be fair about it I don't see any other way then to just change the pow.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:57:24
So basically you are saying there is never a bad time.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:48:41
Do bitcoins without a private key exist?
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:59:13
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:12:17
If nobody can detect if they are actually using asicboost or not then aren't their solutions as good as someone not using asicboost?
GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs all reduced the amount of work you have to do. If they didn't people would still be mining using old methods.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:59:59
Cryptos aren't capped. You can keep making as many as you want with no difference between them.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:43:14
Don't bring that up.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:42:10
Don't blame mt.gox and make plenty of excuses why things like this continue to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:44:14
Not lost forever. It seems likely in the future the crypto will be cracked.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:26:47
What do you mean fake proof of work?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:41:49
First make sure I'm in touch with the employees. When they want to sue your boss I'll make sure they are well represented.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:50:46
Why are you guys against asicboost? Some guy just built a better mousetrap.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:56:44
Lazy kid wins a small lottery and now thinks he doesn't need to do anything with his life. Nice.

The bigger problem is that if you sold $1,000,000 worth of bitcoins the price might crash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:18:08
Thats fine. But if you truly look at it that way you haven't gained 10,000. If bitcoin drops to $10 you haven't lost either. You always had 15.6 BTC.

Bitcoin isn't a scam. But too many people think they are going to get free money owning bitcoin.
It's appealing to the young and inexperienced, gamblers, and wannabe day traders.
The shills keep saying to buy and hold, don't sell, etc. How does that help bitcoin? It only helps people selling at the top. When the rest of the suckers start selling the price is going to plummet. Only a few people are going to get top dollar.
Rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2013-11-21 20:52:37
I don't own any bitcoins. I don't plan on buying some anytime soon.
Right now the price is being driven by speculation and hording. The price has been raising because people believe they can buy in now and sell later at a higher price. If bitcoins can not provide value to back up this speculation their price will plummet once people try to get out. So right now it appears their higher price is only backed up by the shared belief the price will be higher later. That is how it appears to be a type of ponzi scheme.
See: 
My understand and belief is that bitcoins will ultimately be a poor option for a currency and store of wealth. For 99% of my daily transactions a credit card works great. Why would I want to go through all the trouble guarding my private key only to loose the credit and protections provided by my credit card?
Most peoples weath is not stored in cash, but in the things we own such as cars, houses, computers, etc. Why would adopting a deflationary currency be a good thing.

It's just a random bitcoin address I generated suggesting you should store your coins there ;) Of course you shouldn't since you don't have the private keys and your coins would be lost.

The place you are buying something from probably uses bitpay. When you make the purchase your bitcoins are sold and USD is transferred to the store.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:18:25
So bitcoin goes up in value and people start pulling their orders for something priced in bitcoins.
I guess the lesson is: Don't price things in bitcoins.

So if you give me a gold coin, and I give you a note saying I owe you a gold coin, you would say that you never parted with the coin?
Putting your money in your left-hand pocket my not be parting with it. Putting your money in MY left-hand pocket would be.
Since the bank doesn't just put the money 'storage' when you make your deposit you might say that money was 'created.' Since now you have $100 of spendable money promised to you from the bank. And the bank has $100 of money it can invest but will someday need to pay back to you. This works out for everyone until both parties require the money at the same time.

Buy buy buy. If you can only afford to buy 0.01 BTC, take out more loans.

It seems everyone in this communities admits there is going to be some sort of correction. I don't think they realize how severe it's going to be.
Honestly I wish I owned some bitcoins. I wish I would have bought some years ago when I first became aware of them. Pretty soon all of you that own them are going to be wishing you had a chance to sell a few while buyers were still willing to pay unrealistic prices.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:39:48
Why not? It's only going up right?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:41:23
Soon enough you will see a ton of volume as people head for door.
My prediction:
Once people realize the price has reached its peak people will start selling. Price may drop all the way down to $200-300 and recover to $400. May sit there for a bit until the old owners show up to cash out. Price will drop to two digits.
No one is losing sleep thinking the price is going to skyrocket. People are afraid its going to plummet. Your playing a game of chicken that's only going to have a few winners.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:13:31
In this world were you can save for a couple years and buy a house or buy a new car with just a few months of saving it really does seem scarcity must be nearly eliminated.

People with weak hands are people who own bitcoins and are constantly watching the price. If the price starts falling fast they will sell themselves.

I'm curious to know if what you are saying is true. It's a good story.
However keeping the address secret without moving the coins isn't helping anything. If those coins have been there a while they would be on a list of addresses with balances such as:

16umGoeh7J6WeL4D2PTr52UQNadRavcZUC 439.58500000

Wow, this thread is a perfect example of the pot calling the kettle black.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:17:26
When you deposit $100 in the bank you are in essence lending the bank $100. In return you get a promise from the bank to return the money when requested. You typical get a return on your loan to the bank as interest.
To pay this interest the bank might loan your money out to other people at a higher interest rate, keeping the difference. The danger is that if too many people want their deposits back the bank will run out of money and would default.
Why would these loans cease to exist? There seems to be benefits for all parties involved.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:19:06

You haven't made any dollars until you sell. It could stay where its at, go up, or go down.
