I always like giving people a little bitcoin that's always effective!

Strawman? I guess so, I am equating liquidity to having a spare room or having time to drive someone around... the individual is responsible for following the laws, not the people making the iPhone app.
Money transmission laws vary just like hotel regulations and taxi service regulations, My mom does airbnb and if she rented out more than 2 rooms, she would need to install a sprinkler system in her house and pay special hotel taxes... Airbnb isn't responsible for making her pay that tax, they are just acting as a matchmaker and a payment service...  If my mom is a Very Bad Person^TM and rents out a third room, she is responsible for her actions. 
If in my state i can act as a MSB for up to $600 without having to get a license then thats my responcibility to follow that law.

I hope no one actually read this... this is crazy and could totally be used to game the ecosystem...

Uber and Airbnb do the same thing, if my cell phone says i can make $15 by giving someone a ride down the street, I'm going to do it.... If i can make $15 by handing someone $800, I'm going to do that too... 
Of course that begs the question, where does Abra incorporate to avoid the money transmission laws... I dont know, but i have faith they can hang out some country, make a lot of money and pay a lot of taxes

email bitcoin/poker companies that you like and ask them if you can volunteer to help them with the intentions of getting a job down the road... with patience you will be invaluable and if they don't give you a job, their competitors will because of your inside knowledge on that poker company :-)

2965! Well 2965 CNY... so 455 ish... maybe tomorrow or the next day... If the price surged past 3000 CNY, I would have to suspect major bots, and sketchy exchanges....

I am starting to get worried about this rise being some sort of MT Gox like scam from one of these Chinese exchanges.... When Huobi froze on bitcoin wisdom, that was my first thought.
