Technology obsolete... they changed 1 constant in the code hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:17:48
Setting up my node :)
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:30:36
What do you want? We can not discuss scaling or adoption on this sub.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:29:40
Hacking bitcoin is almost imposible. Attacking bitcoin would be easier. If Bitcoin is banned in the west, where are you going to spend your bitcoins? If stores can't accept it, it will become useless. Just for illegal activity, but the current price will be unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:05:06
People are focusing too much on the price... This is not an investment. It's a revolutionary technology that will change the world.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:38:12
Some people say that we should keep the block size at 1MB. But LN requires Segwit. So I guess this is what he was talking about. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:29:39
Yeah I am sure that people who bought at 19k do not regret selling.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:08:35
Where is this? I am in Brighton for a couple weeks 
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:45:07
Any criticism on LN?
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:59:17
LN and Schnorr signatures I think
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:02:36
You didn't lose anything because you had nothing. If you don't own the private keys, it's not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-22 21:22:37
Where is it? I'm in Brighton 
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:11:55
Instead of complaining, just fork the project and make it work. This is open source
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:04:08
100% sure they do
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:51:06
But you will need on-chain tx to open a LN channel. 2-4MB is a good limit for now
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:47:46
Why not? ��
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:09:37
You basically gave the address where you live...
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:40:54
Do you have a plan you increate the block size?
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:17:30
Small miners doesn't have anything to do now a days. Just 8-9 miners control the whole hashrate.
With nodes, 8MB every 10 min would be insignificant, even for poorest countries.
Initial sync is the only thing I might be agree with. But there are work arounds.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:30:43
Buy a Raspberry Pi, external HD, install bitcoin core, run a fullnode, search for a tutorial online on how to install the LN.
Then open a channel (fees can be up to 1-2$ at the moment, cheap).
And then spend what you have left over the LN.
Bitcoin is not for spending.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:50:39
Oh, so you continued reading my argument. I didn't change my opinion. I don't give a fuck about you.
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:32:48
The first LN whitepaper said that we need 128MB to support the whole world. I suppose we did some improvements (channel factories, soon Schnorr, etc...), and also there is no need to support billions of people right now.
But yes, I am with you, we need to talk about on-chain capacity. It can not be 1MB forever.
@_date: 2019-08-21 20:04:28
Relax, you look aggressive and passionate Hahaha
I run 2 nodes one for my company and my personal one.
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:12:08
Ok, I guess that's it right? No more talking about the blocksize. 2MB is enough for all the world.
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:13:13
Attack? These transactions paid fees. How can you differentiate between attacks and regular transaction?
I did a transactions yesterday, is it an attack?
@_date: 2019-08-21 08:34:28
Nobody is talking about bcash here. And yes, technically it's more than 1MB, and yes, it doesn't solve the bottleneck.
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:04:12
4MB or even 8MB would not hurt decentralization.
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:35:07
But... what about coffe??? 
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:33:49
Not 1 week, more like 1-2 years
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:36:18
I dont want your opinion so win-win, get lost, bye
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:11:47
You are not supposed to pay with Bitcoin. Use lightning or credit card.
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:39:17
Thanks now my Bitcoins are a bit more valuable.
@_date: 2019-06-07 04:37:08
In 152 days and 3h
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:37:17
Yes. Fuck Satoshi, he was not perfect and he can be wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:13:44
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:52:17
You must be dreaming. I would not purchase it for 20$.
@_date: 2019-12-28 12:49:11
Silver probably
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:29:19
That will not happen with the txns fees
@_date: 2019-12-02 07:30:46
And how is it doing?
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:28:02
Why not? He is asking for BTC. The adoption on Brighton is huge.
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:45:50
How are withdrawals going to work? Are they going to open a channel with you and freeze X amount of bitcoins just to allow you to withdraw with LN?
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:23:39
Brighton,  UK
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:43:32
Yes it's possible but not probable.
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:53:11
What the fuck are you talking about? I was the node number 28 on the LN mainnet. I believe in LN a lot. But the mempool is not empty because of Segwit.  If you think that Segwit with 20% adoption emptied the mempool in 2 weeks you are delusional 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:18:36
That has nothing to do with Segwit. The spammers must be out of money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:58:22
I’ve never stated that the Network has capacity for millions of people... your reply makes no senses.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:01:33
It’s a fact that we were attacked by spammers for months to increase the fees. And is also a fact that the only scaling solution is Second Layer.
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:33:09
Satoshi can be wrong. He is not smarter than the hundreds of developers working on Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:44:30
To increase the block size more than  32MB they'll have to rewrite the P2P code. Since there is a max length on the P2P messages. I'm not sure if they know how.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:41:20
Use BTCpayserver. One click installer
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:05:16
Now you can with LN
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:05:33
Yes, but it's going to be implemented in Bitcoin Cash first, so maybe Bitcoin can copy it right?
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:15:42
He is right on this one.
We could do a fork for decreasing the block size, and create some rules for increasing it progressively.
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:13:53
It's not about storing the blockchain, it's about bandwidth, cpu processing and initial download...
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:04:35
No, decentralization != open source
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:29:03
How can you afford Bitcoin transactions fees?
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:11:04
Yeah like messing up with the nonce bytes or the difficulty adjustment... lot of work has happen without him, P2PH for example.
We should stop treating Satoshi as God. He did a great contribution to the world, but he was not perfect and made huge mistakes too.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:05:56
You don't understand the purpose behind Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:34:21
Congratulations! But never say the amount you own, it can be dangerous
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:31:57
The fees are independent from the quantity, they are calculated by the transaction size
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:45:38
This is an irrelevant metric. We should focus on building the best cryptocurrency, and the most decentralized.
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:34:15
I'm starting to get tired explaining this over and over... IT'S NOT ABOUT THE STORAGE
