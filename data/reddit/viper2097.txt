These other companies where using the third party issuers BAN numbers and were not Visa Program managers. MCO and Wirecard are partners and not Clients.

You don't understand lightning Network. You fund a channel once and that stays open indefinitely. BTC coming too and from your channel at that point remain open. As BTC comes back and forth from this channel, Fees are basically non existent. This has a trickle down effect, Because you can do infinite transactions while only utilising TWO on chain transactions, This will reduce the load on the blockchain MASSIVELY meaning that when you DO need to fund your lightning channel, The fees will be super low. At one point we WILL need a block size increase but the idea here is to see how lightning network performs first, How many people use it and how they use it. From there, we can decide exactly how big this block size increase needs to be.

If it was me? I would lowball the fee as much as possible. You are sending a transaction that it is not urgent. Im assuming that you and ONLY you hold the private keys to your unencrypted paper wallet? If the answer is yes, You don't need to be in the next block. I suggest a TX fee of 50-75 sats per byte. You should get confirmed in the next week.

Im with you bro, Look, This is crypto and ANYTHING could happen, we know that. There aren't any guarantees but as far as I can see from behind this here Keyboard, Monaco have a really good chance at having a good go at this. The bottom tier card is free and they will even ship it to you for free, The other cards require you to lock up a certain amount of MCO tokens for a period of 6 months (that is the utility of the token) Its worth getting the app, Submitting your KYC and just ordering the free one. Truth be told, They don't even have a live working product yet but its worth getting all set up for when they launch.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:01:41
Take a look at the Monaco prepaid Visa.
They are the only crypto Visa card that has a direct partnership with Visa, This means that they aren’t using a 3rd party card issuer like Wavecrest.
The cards are made of solid metal and will be available next month.
They have a few different tier levels but they are free and ship free, the conversion rate is also better than any of the other cards because they don’t need to pay a cut to Wavecrest!
They also do a cashback of upto 2% in cryptocurrency

I may be wrong but as far as I know, You can only send a Bech32 tx to another segwit address. If you wanted to move your coins to any of the (many) non segwit deployed exchanges, You would first have to move your coins to a p2sh address and then send them to the exchange (or friend with non segwit compatible wallet.
Because of MY use case, I just stick with the p2sh addresses for the mean time but I'm looking forward to Bech32 becoming my go to wallet format when Segwit is adopted by more exchanges and people.

He is correct. Bitcoin is instant and free, If you want to pay a few cents to ensure that your BTC is confirmed a little quicker then thats up to you but that doesnt change the fact it's instant and free.

The fee isnt the only thing that dictates a "High Priority" Transaction, There is also the size of the transaction and the amount of time that the coins have been sitting in the current address, I encourage you to go and read up on how transactions are prioritised before you come on here and claim what I'm saying is incorrect. K, Thx
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:31:14
The reason for fees is to prevent spam and to provide incentive for miners to continue mining when the block reward has diminished to a point where it may not be worth mining any more in the next 10 - 20 years, Anyway, We really don't need to over analyse this, You made an incorrect statement that bitcoin is not free or instant, I said that it is and backed it up with an explanation, You're wrong.

This is a question I have often wondered, Mainly because I would like to know how I stand in comparison with the holdings of the rest of the community but understandably, It's not something that I would ever really want to share about my self so I get why others also wouldnt want to share, Maybe you could think about asking other questions that people may be more comfortable about answering like:
What is your average cost per bitcoin and how long have you been invested for. 
Even that would probably be more than what most would want to answer but some people might be more forthcoming?

True, To be honest, I got bitten. I was all ready to pull the trigger and buy my 1st few bitcoins a few months ago at 500 and then got cold feet because the exchange just seemed SO dodgy, I ended up choosing a different exchange two days later and the price had shot up to around $700, I was really annoyed but I still bought. It just upset me that I could have had more had I bought two days earlier but I'm glad I didn't trust that dodgy exchange.
Anyway, Since I bought at $700 they just kept dropping and dropping so I kept buying all the way down and ended up averaging out at around $600 and the best thing is that if the price had kept going UP after I bought at $700 I wouldn't have had as many BTC as I have now.
I'm super excited that I might brake even today!
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:35:42
Aussie bitcoin exchanges are not screwed. I'm not sure where you are getting your info about the exchanges from but BTC Markets is operating right now and not charging 10% GST on bitcoins. You only have to pay GST on Fees but they have been doing that since they started anyway. If you are paying 1% on fees then 10% of 1% (~0.1%) will be the only GST you are paying, You have ALWAYS payed it and never complained before. What's changed?

I'm not going to defend smoking because I realise its stupid. But yes, Obesity is far worst, One google search should set you straight about the amount of obesity related illnesses vs smoking ones.
I have seen 90 year old smokers (Granted not in the best shape) but go and find me a biggest loser contestant looking fatty that is 90.
And this is exactly my point. As soon as I post about smoking there is already one person who has posted to tell me how stupid it is yet if you call someone fat then you are being offensive. I don't get how this world works sometimes.

If the neighbours were involved, I would post notes in the elevators and on your floor offering a $1000 reward for the USB stick back, Kind of like how they do when someone looses a pet...
(Don't make the reward to big because you don't want to make it obvious what they have)
Say its your "E Wallet Tax Backup" and without it you can't pay your taxes or can't claim deductions so its very important to you. (But gives the impression that is has no monitory value and is just important to you)
If they look at the files on the stick and see a "wallet.dat" file then it will all seem legit...
Tell them to contact you via email and that way they can make a fake email using a public computer and feel secure.
You may need to agree to some kind of anonymous escrow guy but I'm sure there are people who do that, This kind of thing happens more than you think.
Good luck bro. I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.

There are some people saying between 100k and a million, While I think that is EXTREMELY optimistic, I wouldn't have a problem if it did :)
Conservative estimates put it at around 3k-4k by years end but its all just talk and as far as I can see, The credentials of people making these estimates are just as good as the credentials of the people saying Bitcoin is going to fail.
I my self am invested in Bitcoin. I understand the technology and see how it could be very useful to people all across the world but I have only put in money that I am willing to lose, It will still hurt if I do lose it because its still a substantial amount but if it all goes to shit, Its not like I will lose my house, car or anything like that.
Also remember that you don't need to buy full bitcoins, They are divisible upto 8 decimal places so if one week you only have $50 to spend then you can go and get your self 0.12 but say the next week you have a good week at work and can put $700 in then you can go and buy 1.6. I am just making up these prices but you get my point.

You only have to pay GST once, You charge the customer the $110 in bitcoin, You then sell the bitcoin for money that then goes into your bank account, The money that goes into the bank account becomes the money you got from the job and that is the only amount of money that you pay tax on. You only pay once.

No, Bitcoin isn't a company but companies are investing in it and companies wanting to accept bitcoin are cropping up everyday, Cutting off their ability to have a bank account is point blank anti competitive, Banks don't want people using bitcoin, they want people using banks and THAT is anti competitive.
And please... Banks aren't held responsible for their customers committing crimes any more than ISP's are held responsible for you downloading a few sex and the city episodes to watch with your boyfriend.
If the bank can prove that someone is committing a crime then sure... Cut off their account, Thats fine... I believe that people should be innocent until proven guilty... In saying that, I think we all know that's not what its really about. Why would ANY bank want to deal the competition that Bitcoin will provide for them? Its much more profitable for them to have a monopoly on money, I get that... Only thing is; Its not legal.

How is he a troll? Its EXACTLY what I do!
I like to buy full bitcoins so if my exchange is listing them at $500 each, I would deposit $520 at the bank so that when the money is credited into my account, I will have enough in my account incase the price goes up.

As far as I understand the law, thats not entirely true.
Gox filed for bankruptcy (and enlisted legal council) BEFORE those 200,000 coins where magically found. Therefor those coins were not available when the lawyers took the case and can't be spent to pay law fees.
The lawyers took the case for a company they knew was insolvent, The people who invested money, invested into a company they thought was solvent. There for that money would go to the people who were defrauded or in other words, they people who lost money they had invested in Gox

We found a workaround and fixed the problem at bitcoinpaperwallet.com, but you still shouldn't use Safari 5.x at bitaddress.org.

This whole forum is just supposed to be a place for discussion about Bitcoin and I thought the topic may be interesting for some. I don't see where in my post I asked for your or anyones help or hand holding although I think you may have just written that line because you thought it sounded cool, You know... Like from a movie or something?

So you are saying that if every single person on earth used coin join then there is absolutely ZERO chance that your bitcoins would be going DIRECTLY to someone who would use it for crime?
Nope, It doesn't matter if 10 people are using it or every single person in the world uses it, Your money still could go DIRECTLY to financing death.

You have no idea what fungibility is. You're saying that you can get similar prices if 2 are physically identical? yeah... ok.

Is circle only for Americans?
@_date: 2014-07-21 12:29:07
I have always used BTC Markets and can't speak highly enough about them, the volume floats around 25 - 35 BTC per day and the price is pretty much identical to the spot price out of the USA give or take $10, Sometimes its a little higher but its also lower sometimes too.
Any questions I have ever had have been replied by email within minutes and when I deposit cash at a branch; I have never waited longer than half an hour (although they do say that you may have to wait up to a full hour on the website) for the money to be credited to my account which is great when you feel like the price is right and you want to buy NOW
When it comes to withdrawals, I have never sold any of my bitcoins for cash but they do offer FREE cash withdrawal to your bank account if you want to get out and as far as withdrawing the actual bitcoins to your personal wallet; The bitcoin appears on blockchain.info before you even have a chance to click refresh.
BTC Markets is a fantastic service and I can't speak highly enough about them.

Not that it really helps you now but for the future, take a screenshot of the QR code that you used in the 1st place to get google authenticatior to show the code. Rename the screenshots to their respective codes e.g. "Cryptsy.jpg" and then just store them on a USB stick in your safe.
If you ever lose the phone you can re scan the codes in from the screenshots and you will be bank up and running!

Honest Question: How long did the tulip craze last for? I bitcoin has been going crazy since it launched in Jan 2009 and 5 and a half years later its still doing well, Did the tulip craze last longer that 5.5 years?

Don't take it so seriously, It was just a joke.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:03:02
Yep, And thats scary considering that one of the pools has 40% hash rate at the moment.
at just one or two confirmations, it would be quite easy to reverse spends and an attacker could easily clean out an exchange before anyone knew what was going on.
This is obviously be very unlikely because bitcoin price would plummet after such an attack and the lucrative profits that mining pools make would be gone from that point on but the fact remains that it IS possible.
Keeping it to 6 confirmations makes it less likely and i'm ok with that.
Bitcoin could fork to shorter block times or larger block sizes and this would bring down the time significantly but I'm pretty happy with the way things are.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:35:50
You are correct but just the fact that one pool has &gt;50% would be bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:51:31
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:45:37
The big mining pools sometimes solve 10 blocks in a row... 6 confirmations is just being safe rather than sorry and remember that the 6 confirmations doesn't just protect the people who own the exchange but the users that already have coins in the exchange. I feel safer knowing that many confirmations are required to get coins into an exchange that I trade on.
Also remember that you can use something like LTC or Black Coin or any coin with a faster confirmation time to move coins from one exchange to another quickly (if you see an arbitrage opportunity that you want to exploit quickly)
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:39:56

thats what the option is in the latest version of Bitcoin QT which is the version of the bitcoin client that I use but the option might be called something else in the software that you are using.
Just be very careful with accepting help from people who you don't know, people are really tricky and if you don't know anything about bitcoin, they could fool you and steel your coins.
Don't follow peoples instructions over private message, if you have any questions, ask them here in this sub reddit publicly for all to see and if anyone tries to scam you, The other members will pick them up on it.

Actually you're wrong. I do have the right to receive service from a bank if I'm paying my fees and abiding by their rules just like everyone else.
The banks don't have the right to make specials rules that exclude people just for using competing technologies. It probably breaches Anti Trust laws as well.
I do agree with you that they will get away with it though, The only reason for my post was just to point out that its not fair and above all, Not legal.
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:13:23
Nope, Because it says "Gox pays back" Its pretty simple buddy...
When you are "Payed back" from entity X; you are receiving money BACK from entity X based on what you gave entity X in the 1st place. I seriously can't believe that you don't understand it. 
Entity X being Gox. If you didn't have anything in Gox then how would you receive anything BACK from them?

If we make the standard name "Bits" we can still use mBTCs its like how we use "Cents" and "Dollars"
100 cents = 1 dollar, It could be the same with Bits and mBTC
A cheeseburger costs 200 cents but I can still say Dollars to make it easier
I'm all for Bits being brought in as the standard and I don't think it limits us to still using other terms all the way up to 1 Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:02:50
I may be completely wrong and please correct me if I am but if large mining pools commonly solve 10 blocks in a row, doesn't that mean that they could easily reverse transactions that were made with only 1 confirmation?

No but if the "someone" you are talking about is a company and they are registered with the government with a company number then they aren't legally allowed to deny you service just because your black or gay or short or use a competing service.
If you think i'm wrong; Lets just agree to disagree.
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:29:50
Yeah, that sucks but remember that ALOT of people payed much more than $560 and when you think about the potential of bitcoin (Some people are saying between 100k and a million per BTC which I think is very optimistic but its still a valid prediction) $70 doesn't really make much of a difference does it?
Just remember the rule of and don't spend more than you can afford to lose and you will be fine.

I am really curious about this as well. Contracts would have to be involved, the costs of getting those written up along with the cost of actually buying someones gox credit wouldn't be cheap, Thats why I really feel as though who ever this guy was, May have known that 200k BTC would be "Found"
At the end of the day though, This guy might just be running a scam that involved a trojan horse and steeling peoples bitcoins or something like that... I really have no idea. I would be really interested to hear from someone who dealt with this guy...

Your were trying to make a point by making something up about me asking for help from the government which you can't find anything to quote me on but just say that I implied it, You can't even quote me on anything that implies it so forgive me for "losing the thread of conversation" what ever that means.
Re: Functioning governments and your claim it has nothing to do with your point? You seem to think that wanting the law enforced somehow translates to beging the government for help and also asking for people on Reddit to holt their hand. I find it ironic that you choose to live in the western world where the governments enforce laws down to the most minor of crime so yes... I think it does have a lot to do with what you call "your point"

No, Bitcoin is completely fungible which means that 1 bitcoin is worth as much as every other, Sure... people might prefer to have the newly minted bitcoin in much the same way that people would prefer to have a newly minted fiat coin, It shines which means it isn't covered in dirt, germs and particles of shit but they are still worth the same.

I really don't get it, the title is "If gox pays back ~25% of your BTC" and he clearly said he never had any there. So if he never gave them any thing then he would be getting payed "back" 25% of nothing!

You don't need UDID codes, Anyone can manually update the firmware on the phone by going to iTunes and holding option while clicking on the update firmware button.
Then it opens up a screen where you choose where the firmware is located and you just choose the iOS 8 package you downloaded from your torrent site.
Better instructions than these will be in the torrent package or comments.

Asking the government for help? I live in a democratic country where I vote for my leader based on his laws and policy, I then pay taxes for these laws that I have voted for to be enforced.
Besides that, I am not starting a law suit, I have never said I am, just simply that the Banks are opening them selfs up to one.

I saw your post after I made them and now I'm all freaked out so I googled the issue to see if anyone else had similar results but found only your post on github...
On github, you state that the problem is only with Safari 6.05 but here, you say Safari 5.x
Did you make a typo here or is the problem with both Safari 5 &amp; 6

I understand what you are saying and I'm not going to down vote you or any thing like that. Like I said, Its my opinion and I encourage all people to have their own even if they differ to mine but I will say this:
When I use my Bitcoin QT client to send BTC to the Alpaca sock dealer, I know with 100% certainty that my money is going to the alpaca socks dealer and if I use Dark Wallet, The only thing I know with 100% certainty is that my BTC is NOT going to the Alpaca socks dealer.
Sure, most likely its going to purchase something completely legitimate but there is a chance (and I can't say exactly what chance) that my money is going directly to a terrorist or a child pornographer and while that may be a chance that you are willing to take, its not one that I am.
My post was not written to spark debate about wether or not everyone should use Dark Wallet, I just wrote it so people who maybe don't understand exactly how it works would be able to make an informed decision on if its right for them or not.

To be honest, Its hard to actually put a $ value on something because the developers get to chose how much different things cost kind of like add on content for apps in the Apple App store.
To give you a rough idea, If you played a racing game like Forza motor sports, You could buy a cool exclusive car and it might cost 2 or 3 bucks. If you play Destiny or Call of Duty, You could buy an expansion pack, It includes new missions, multiplayer maps, guns and stuff like that, They will set you back around $15 - $20
You can guy full games if you wanted to, New release premium AAA games are going to set you back around $70 but you can pick up an older release for less than an expansion pack for a new game, I think Titanfall was going for like $10 last week.
$10 will buy you a months access to Xbox Live which is the thing you need if you want to play games online, An Xbox live subscription is usually payed for you a year at a time which is like $60 but people who can't afford that all at once can pay month by month.
There are ALOT of things you can do with bitcoin on the Xbox store so its all really exciting!
Please note that I live in Australia and the prices are all different so for the people reading this who might want to complain about my numbers being wrong, don't bother.

I wish I had used your site but i have already created the addresses and sent the BTC.
I am justifying it to my self (Purely out of laziness) as an added layer of security, if only one browser can decrypt my bip38 key and only I know what that browser version is.
Just out of curiosity though, (I know i should be nervous with old browsers) but did you notice any issues specifically with Safari 5? or just with 6?

Yep, I'm not sure how it works in the states but here in Australia they call them "Statutory rights" and they are awarded to a consumer regardless of TOS, Things like: "Every new product has to come with a 1 year warranty" or "If there is a product defect, the customer is entitled to a full refund" Even if a shop had a sign that read "No refunds" it wouldn't matter and I could still get my refund if the product was defective.
I'm sure they would have a smilier thing in USA, Otherwise google could just put into the TOS that they have the right to fuck anyone who signs up for a Gmail account and you would have to have sex with google under the law...

You don't have to leave the house, You can also do a bank transfer.
Everytime I have done one to BTC markets it has been in my account the same or next business day.
The only benefit of paying by cash is that you remain a little bit more anonymous.
If you choose to transfer with the bank it means that your bank has a record of you sending money to the BTC Markets account and thats absolutely fine but some people don't like that.
Good luck on your investment bro and remember, Only buy what you can afford to lose!

Good call, I have created multiple addresses to i can send a tiny amount to all of them.
I shouldn't need to re do the whole mouse thing you have to do every time I make a new address should I?
Am I correct to assume that it doesn't work like a deterministic seed some how? That if one address is compromised, all of them will be compromised?

This is a bitcoin subreddit, Its for ALL aspects of bitcoin, Even the ones you don't find interesting.
I see posts on this sub every day that I don't find interesting but I would never bother to go in there and say that the topic isn't interesting because I'm sure what is true for me isn't for someone else.
I personally find the price of bitcoin very interesting, as do others.
If the topic bores you, just stay out of the posts regarding price.

open the bitcoin client and select "back up wallet"
save the back up to a USB key
then download the newest version of the bitcoin client that you were running on the old computer
install it on a new computer (it may takes a week or two to download and verify the latest copy of the block chain)
take the USB key and restore the backup on the latest version of the client.

It is an investment if you are betting on it being a successful payment system. The market cap is too low at the moment for it to be truly useful so for it to be a realistic payment system, The market cap will have to go up which will (in turn) bring the value of everyones BTC up.

I bought a replacement laptop fan for my macbook the other day, the footprint was much bigger than that of an entropy device. I was amazed that they managed to fit it into a regular envelope, it was sandwiched in between two layers of thin cardboard and then wrapped with bubble wrap and taped over with clear sticky tape. (Instead of sticky tape, You could use a hologram sticker so people know that nothing has been tampered with)
I feel like the cheapest way to send it would be in a similar way, Just in a regular envelope, I would be happy to pay extra for the postage and i'm sure everyone else would be as well. It's only fair.
You could also add in another option: $49 - Entropy Device + International Shipping

You said: "There are no literal physical bitcoins, there is no one unique representation that could be considered "yours". To care that "yours" are going to a terrorist is like caring that the number 7 can be used by terrorists. CoinJoin works by combining with other spenders to form a transaction that has outputs=inputs, but output0 is not necessarily equal to input0. Your complaint then is that in a transaction like 1+2+3+4 = 2+4+3+1 you don't like the fact that "your" 3 might go to a pornographer."
Just as a $100 bill has no actual worth, Its just what it represents, So you are saying you would have no problem giving a $100 bill to someone who wants to use it to make a bomb because its really only worthless paper? Ok...

When I 1st got into bitcoin the price tanked but I still held. Now every single bitcoin I own is WELL in profit.

Buy your BTC, Keep upto date with the news and price but don't stress too much if you see a drop. It happens...

I downloaded the Bitcoin QT wallet and while I was waiting for it to sync up, I did most of my in-depth research. I would start with 0.1 just so you can build a bit of trust with your chosen exchange and figure out how to send them back and forth, Then you can experiment putting it on a paper wallet.
If its still on the paper wallet after a day or two then that means your computer is probably secure, You will also have a good idea about how to move BTC around from exchange to personal computer, Computer to iPhone, iPhone to paper wallet and then back again so you're ready to start throwing some real money (that you can afford to lose) at bitcoin.
If you screw something up then you are only down $60 (I'm not trying to be arrogant and suggest that $60 is worthless, just that $60 is a rather cheap price for a first hand education in the future of money)
If you have any questions then come back and ask here. Good luck and welcome to the community!

You're point is absolutely fair and whilst I agree with you that theft is the biggest risk, I think comparing the ETF to an exchange where people are constantly withdrawing bitcoin is not a fair comparison.
While the holder of ETF shares will be able to withdraw the underlying asset (Bitcoin) I don't see this happening at all. They will simply sell their shares and the actual coins will stay in cold storage. Just my two satoshis

The main reason for it is to let people who dont care about transaction times to get cheaper fees, going to larger blocks like ~1.2mb (which would be same as adding 20mb to the weekly block size) would not reduce fees at all but doing one big block which flushes the mempool every X blocks would allow that to happen. Look at the end of the day, I don't support a hard fork, I would much prefer a soft fork to SegWit but I was just throwing out an idea to see what people thought.

Your money? You were credited with a BFX token for every dollar of "your money" that was stolen, Bitfinex then bought back every single one of those BFX tokens at 100 cents on the dollar bit by bit over the course of the year. "Your Money" will now appear in your USD balance along with every single other user who uses the exchange. How do you not know this?
It's pretty clear to me that you never even had a Bitfinex account at the time of the hack or you would be all over this, Your account history shows you have only been using reddit for 4 months and your first post about bitcoin was only three months ago, You seem to be dirty about something because all you do is complain about the exchanges and the Bitcoin ecosystem. I really dont get the point...

I don't understand what you mean when you say Bitcoin is out of reach for the poor. The smallest denomination of Bitcoin (1 satoshi) is FAR cheaper than the smallest denomination of Fiat in your home, The UK.
I specifically gave a disclaimer that I don't know anyone's financial situation before I have an EXTREMELY wide example (10x to be exact) of between $10 and $100. I find it interesting that you went to the very top of my example to make your point but... it is what it is right?
On that... In my currency, $10 is worth about 5 of your pounds. If someone wants to start investing in ANY financial instrument, I don't think .71p per day is too much to ask.
Side note... It kind of sounds like you're insinuating White Male's are a bad thing? I'm a white male and I think its great. If you have an issue with us, You could always move to a country that wasn't founded and built by white males... Just a thought...

It doesnt work like that. Odds effectively reset after every deal.
It will STILL be a 1/420 million chance per day, Not 1 in 3.

Dude, you need to calm down. Like I said, If you actually DID have anything stolen from you in the hack, you would know that Bitfinex issued a BFX token for every single dollar stolen, These tokens were bought back over the course of a year for a full dollar each. If you had 10,000 BFX tokens directly after the hack, Your USD balance was a full $10,000 within a year because Bitfinex bought back single token for a dollar. I don't understand why you are getting so upset. It was actually a really revolutionary way to pay back everyone that lost money and the lawyers didn't get a cent

In this article, they Say Bitcoin is a fiat currency. That's not true. Fiat just means "Value by decree" Government currency is Fiat currency because the government writes it into law that the paper has value. There is no law or decree to say that Bitcoin has value, It has value because people want it not because of any other reason...
Bitcoin has a set inflation rate, I can tell you exactly how many bitcoin will be in circulation 10 days from now, 10 years from now and 100 years from now, How on earth does this contribute to added volatility of Bitcoin? If anything, It would contribute to reduced volatility. Who ever wrote this article doesnt finance..

The tokens traded at their market value just like any token on any market. The promise that BFX made to its users was that they would pay back every dollar and they did! People who didn't trust that would happen were free to sell the the tokens on the market for the market price, People who believed that BFX would be able to buy back the tokens waited till they were redeemed by Bitfinex in full.
I dont understand why you have such a problem with this. Every other company that goes insolvent just goes into liquidation and the lawyers take most of what's left, You would have taken a much bigger haircut than 36%
A lot of people sold their tokens for 10c on the dollar as soon as Bitfinex opened up a market for them, As far as im concerned, They are the people that are brain dead!
As far as your "90% of the people that used to trade at bitfinex stopped" stat... That's a very round number "90%" hey? Do you have any actual evidence to back that up? As far as im aware, Bitfinex's trade volume is far greater than what it was before the hack happened. It sounds to me like you are just making up your own stats to win an argument on reddit... Who would bother?

An exchange is a place where people come to trade two different things. 
- Bob has a bank account full of cash and wants to buy some Bitcoin
-Jane has been holding Bitcoin for a few years and want to get some cash
-Bob deposits USD onto the exchange
-Jane Deposits Bitcoin onto the exchange
-Bob sets a limit order offering $4264 per bitcoin and wants to buy 10 Bitcoins
-Jane see's Bobs buy order at the front of the book and decides that is a god price to sell her bitcoin for.
-Jane then sells 10 of her bitcoin into Bob's buy order
-Bobs account is debited $42640 and credited with 10 Bitcoin
-Jane's account is debited 10 bitcoin and is credited with $42640
-Both party's may now withdraw their new procurements into either their bank account or bitcoin wallet
This is pretty much how it works. Please note that I have not taken fee's into account which can range between 0.00% and and 1% (This is how the exchange makes money)
Hope this helps.

Worthless? A tether represents 1USD, Please check this website to judge exactly what one tether is "Worth". 
As far as I'm aware, The value of anything is based on what others are willing to pay for it. 
I think you need to take a little break from being butthurt and do some research on how markets work.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:44:31
Yeah but what I meant to say is that its impossible to use those funds anywhere because the cost of the fees is higher that the balance of the account

This is not someone transferring to an exchange to sell... He he set his fee at 10sats per byte, this means he is in absolutely NO rush for the BTC to go anywhere. If he was looking to FOMO sell, He would have included a higher fee to ensure that his coins were included in the next block.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:02:59
The reason Bitcoin is worth $4120.90 right now is because that is what people are willing to pay for it, The reason a Tether costs $1 right now is because thats what people are willing to pay for it.
Look, Instead of explaining basic market dynamics to someone who is obviously high on chromosomes, I'm just going to laugh... I'm going to laugh because you're an internet troll who compares him self to the creator of Bitcoin but adds absolutely nothing to anything.

Dude, I have looked back through my emails to find when I first got my bitcoin and there is an email back and forth between myself and the support team from my local exchange, I literally had NO idea how it all worked because I had never even bought stocks or anythinging like that... They weren't really much help and pretty much just linked me to one of their support articles with a lot of wording that I didn't really understand, This whole thing has been a great learning experience and I'm always happy to help out anyone who is new to this or has questions.

Phil is an upstanding member of the Bitcoin community and to be honest, I find it absolutely ridiculous that this chat between mates is being posted here after all this time just to discredit this man who has done more for bitcoin than any of the reddit trolls.

Youre right but the idea is that you would be earning more than your time is worth at your regular job if you bent over and picked up the penny. I dont understand your reddit for two hours example because you arent actually getting paid to be on reddit, You are doing it because you enjoy it! No one actually enjoys bending over but OPs point is that you would get paid MORE spending a second doing that than you would at your regular job. Im not really sure why im having to explain this to people.

I get that my math is wrong but you get my point right? He would be solving blocks every month or two with that kind of logic...

You haven't lost money until you sell chief and keep in mind, Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, Its supposed to replace money, Not make money for some peasant like your self. If you are only in crypto because you want to make money, Go trade forex or equities. This isn't for you.

@_date: 2018-06-29 00:30:33
Dude, I bought in at $700 and kept buying for the next 1.5 years all the way down to $200 and then back up again. Us "Early adopters" have gone through this all before and its a right of passage, Weak hands will leave and strong hands will hold and keep buying, This is how bitcoin gets stronger. Yes, If people are complaining about losing money then they shouldn't have bought in to crypto in the first place. I have zero empathy for you or anyone else.
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:00:06
That's not the point. an hour is just an arbitrary time frame that we use to value our time. The point is that if you're making less than $36 per hour then youre making LESS than one penny per second so the idea is that its worth your time to pick it up. I thought it was cool anyway...
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:33:10
There is nothing lucky about it. I invested in something that I believed in and continued to drop over YEARS while everyone in my life told me I was stupid and Bitcoin was a scam and a Ponzi and yet, I just kept buying more. Thats not luck chief... I put a lot of hard earned savings into this and if it wasn't for us guys who believed in Bitcoin early, It wouldn't exist as you know it now. You have a lot to be thankful for, Show some respect.

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:38:51
My advice might differ from advice you have been reading but if you are buying Bitcoin amounts like that, I would leave it on the exchange. Reason being is that Fee's to take it out of the exchange might take away a large percentage of your Bitcoin. You are much better moving it off in one larger sum, Say amounts of $100 or more. Its best to have all of the seperate transactions consolidated into one otherwise you will have lots of tiny transactions and will have to pay large fees AGAIN when you decide to actually send them somewhere... Best of luck and welcome to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:14:57
And that is a fair concern. BTG doesn't have replay protection however Ledger has worked out a way to protect against this attack but I chose to be EXTRA cautious. Move all of your bitcoin to a new address first, That way your Bitcoins are 100% safe. If you haven't taken the opportunity to move your legacy coins to a segwit address, this is the perfect time, If you have, Just move them to the next available segwit address.
After this is done, Go to the BTG Gold Splitting tool and move your bitcoin gold directly to an exchange and dump that for some new Bitcoins.

I know this isn't the answer to your question but don't stress about arbitrary numbers like ONE FULL BITCOIN. $1000 worth of Bitcoin is worth $1000 worth of Bitcoin, Owning a full bitcoin is nothing but a psychological goal, Don't push more money than you can afford to lose into crypto just so you can hit an arbitrary target. I have been in the game since 2013 and I have seen first hand how much things can move in just a few hours. Pace your self, Be smart and you will be fine.

Nope, It would not have mattered and the reason I speak in past tense is because the Segwit2x fork never happened. The miners withdrew their support just two blocks before lock in.

Exchanges ARE centralised, Bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:05:48
My argument is based on this:
People with USD sitting on an exchange have USD, Not Bitcoin. If they want their USD on an exchange then they HAVE to swap it for bitcoin to get it out which inflates the price but if the still want to have USD on an exchange then they have to sell those BTC for USD on another exchange which suppresses the price.
I get what you are saying and you make a fair point but I just wanted to put forth a thought that I think a lot of people are currently missing. 
I should also say, I don't have any affiliation with BFX or any long positions (unless you count my 1x long cold storage)

MCO and PAY Tokens both started out as ICOs where they promised a share of the profits that the companies made would be given to the token holders. Both of these companies have now removed the profit share scheme because it would make the tokens a security. I would like to know what these companies plan to do with profits that were originally supposed to go to the token holders. Surely they aren't just keeping it? Anyway, I would be really curious to know. Thanks.

I'm saying that you have had an account since 2013 and only started posting about Bitcoin last year. That's how I can tell you only got into Bitcoin last year.
It makes no sense for someone to start a reddit account, Post with it and then not use it for 4 years and then just start using it again to post about Bitcoin in the exact timeframe that all the plebs got in to Crypto because they heard they could "get rich"
Occams Razor, The Simplest explanation is usually the correct explanation.
The other thing is, Its always the guys who are new to crypto that come on to reddit and post comments like yours, People like my self who have been in the industry for years just come here to contribute, If we see something we don't like, We don't care because we are rich and above it.
I hope that all makes sense to you :)

Blockstream's satellite is just one node. Anyone has the ability to run their own node and every new node increases decentralisation. Blockstream can't just delete transactions out of the blockchain because it won't match the copy of the Blockchain that all the other nodes are running.  Bitcoin relies on consensus, meaning; If a minority of nodes don't agree with the majority of nodes, They are simply ignored.

If the people who bought in December / January don't realise what they have then they shouldn't have bought it in the first place. Bitcoin is NOT a get rich quick scheme. I have been in Crypto since 2013 (you can verify this by my Reddit post history starting early 2014) and I was a part of a bear market that lasted almost 2 years yet I kept buying all the way down to the bottom and I STILL spread the word and put everything I had into crypto as it just went lower and lower. I didn't cry and complain that my "investment was down" I knew I was a part of something amazing and if the people who bought in late 2017 cant see that then it's not my issue.

Look kid, You may assume that this is some kind of debate but it's not. I took my time to try and explain it to you so be grateful.
It's a very well known and accepted fact that it's bullish when there are more shorts than longs and its bearish when there are more longs than shorts.
Take a look at your self, Without even talking to you, I can tell that you have absolutely no experience trading, How do I know this? It's because you don't understand basic market dynamics.
Next time, someone spends the effort trying to explain something to you, Stop, Say thank you and if you have any questions you can ask politely, Don't talk back and don't try and enter into a debate with someone you could learn something from.

Bitcoin with a capital B refers to the technology and bitcoin with a lowercase b refers to the currency or unit of account.
As far as I'm aware, The white paper is about the tech and the doesn't actually mention the currency or unit of account "bitcoin" at all in the white paper... as in... not even once.... (Although I could be mistaken, It's been a while since I read it)
That's why I used a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto (creator of Bitcoin) talking about bitcoin (lower case "b" meaning the currency) to prove my point that the word "bitcoins" is actually (and in no uncertain terms) a thing.
Sorry bro... You're wrong...

We will need to increase block size at some point but it's premature right now. The core devs have a pretty good plan and I think it makes a lot of sense. Basically, They want to first see how these second layer solutions work, Get a feel for what the adoption level is and how much pressure is actually being removed from the the blocks in real world use. After that, They will figure out how much of a block size increase we need and when such a change should be implemented. At the moment, More and more exchanges have started batching withdrawals and implementing Segwith and that has done an amazing job of reducing the strain. You can currently get a TX confirmed in the next block for 1 satoshi per byte.
The idea is to keep the blocks as small as possible for the sake of keeping the largest amount of nodes online and make sure everyone stays honest. De-centralisation is the name of the game.

A short is really just a contract that someone puts in where they PROMISE to buy bitcoin later...
A short has already effectively sold the bitcoin so when a short closes, they will need to buy back the Bitcoin.
If there are no shorts then it means that there are no promises to buy bitcoin at a later date in time.
Its very bullish when people are shorting and prices are going up... That means people are selling AND the price is going up AND there are plenty of promises to buy bitcoin later on.
Conclusion: 
Lots of shorts = BULLISH
No Shorts = Bearish

Why do you keep going on about wikipedia dude?
Here is a link to the archived quote I'm referring to, It'e from Nov 2008 (Before the genius block)
And seriously, If your whole argument is now "Well you used a capital B so both you and Satoshi Nakamoto are wrong and I'm right" then... well...  I don't really know what to say homie but feel free to show me a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto referring to multiple bitcoins as multiple bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:24:47
I don't really understand how editing my messages for spelling or grammar change my point that bitcoins are a thing! It means more than one bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-01-13 13:37:55
aaahhhhhh... Another know it all on reddit. 
After you feel wrong, Feel free to admit it...
1) Google "21 million bitcoin" and find me ONE link that says "21 million bitcoin" instead of "21 million bitcoins"
2) "As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future." -Satoshi Nakamoto
This is one of MANY quotes from Satoshi Nakamoto referring to "bitcoins"
Satoshi actually created Bitcoin and you are a random guy on reddit...
People like you own "bitcoin" and people like me own "bitcoins" :)
Is there anything you would like to say?
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:15:27
Not trying to be a dick but that isn't the Bitcoin logo, It's just an actual B, You would think they would have those two cursive lines running through it, Obviously Bitcoin will be supported when this thing is released cause... well it's Bitcoin but I'm thinking that "B" is almost supposed to be a Generic crypto logo and not representative of Bitcoin.

I live in Australia, All the way down at the bottom of the world, There are LOTS more exchanges now but there were really only one or two back when I signed up but even back then, I created an account, sent my documents and got approved, Then its just a matter of doing a bank wire and waiting for it to hit, Its no different than paying for your rent.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:01:10
After being in Bitcoin for over half a Decade, I have to say... I've had a few debates on Reddit with people who are new to crypto and rarely do they admit when they are wrong but I thought surely a quote from Satoshi himself talking about something you say doesn't exist would be enough to convince even the most stubborn and uneducated crypto user.
I really don't have anything more for you dude... All the best with with your Millibits ;)

I know that the whole "This is actually good for Bitcoin" is a bit of a Meme around here and I do agree that news is bearish for Bitcoin in the short term but I think long term its positive. There are SO many people who have gotten scammed or Phished from google adds and Pay 2 Play search results putting things higher on the search list. Without Crypto ads it means that all search results will be organic and there will be far less scams, It also means that ICOs will be less published and money that would have gone in to them, will come into BTC instead. Anyway, Just my thoughts.

@_date: 2018-03-12 05:06:38
Technically you are both kind of right. One could argue that the Key's thet control the bitcoin are what is of value. Since the Key's are stored on the device you could say that the bitcoin is stored on the phone.
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:41:11
No, It would be less cost effective to mine. Mining is MORE profitable when the bitcoin you are mining is worth more and less profitable when the bitcoin you have minded is worth less.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:12:45
Yep :) I have been in Bitcoin since it was easy to buy full bitcoins.
Newer guys rarely say "bitcoins" with an "S" because they can't afford to own full ones. It's cute and let's them feel like they are part of the action.
I can assure you that those of us who have been in the space since back in the day refer to multiple bitcoins as "bitcoins". :)
Funnily though, I was buying Ether at the pre-sale (we didn't have a word for ICO back then) and the word "Ether" is both singular and plural... Not really sure why, I have always though it was because "Ether" was sold as a fuel and BTC is supposed to be a currency, Generally fuel sources are both singular and plural, That's just a guess though...
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:48:58
Im so confused...
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:33:04
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Nodes do not validate Bcash blocks, Bcash SV blocks or Bcash ABC blocks. The word "Bitcoin" shouldn't be used at all.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:30:00
Yep, And the Bitcoin you are mining is worth less... am I really having this conversation?
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:26:09
I dont mean to offend you brother but 10 Bitcoins is nothing. BFX aren't going to risk their credibility JUST to screw someone out of 10 measly Bitcoins. Bitfinex makes about 5 bitcoins every minute just from trading fees and margin funding fees alone, That doesn't include all of their other revenue streams like all the interest that is paid to them just from having all of that USD sitting in a bank account. It also doesn't include all of their other highly lucrative side businesses. Why on earth would they risk it all just to take your 10 Bitcoins?
I get really annoyed about comments like yours because you obviously have no understanding about how much money they make and don't understand that they simply have no incentive rip anyone off.
I also get annoyed at all the Tether FUD. There is no incentive for Finex to print Tether when they are literally printing SO MUCH Bitcoin and USD every minute. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:11:35
My mates couldn't give a two shits about doxing them selves. It really is just the "I want to buy them right now, Oh... I have to take the time and send my documents in and even the I have to wait DAYS to be verified?" So they just think "Oh... all too much work"
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:13:35

There will always be a reason to mine Bitcoin but as far as specific costs go... It has been estimated that it costs the big Chinese miners around $1000usd to mine each Bitcoin so they are making BANK, Its unprofitable for people like you and I now but it would be even MORE so back down there...
Its like asking "Would it be more profitable to mine gold if XAU is at $10 or $10,000..." Same thing...
Hope this helps
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:43:25
The first output is your send amount, the second output it your change and its sending to a change address... I don't know why the ledger NANO S show's this and makes your confirm it when you're making a segwit transaction, Its confusing and redundant.

Dude just buy it all ay once. Thing is, Even if Bitcoin drops 20% in a day, thats really only $100 and its unrealised anyway because you're going to be holding for a long time anyway so those dips are all just white noise and after tx fees, you're really better off just doing the whole thing in one transaction.

About 500 million dollars worth of Tether has been printed since the subpoena so to say that they have stopped printing because of the subpoena is just incorrect.
The fact is that money is simply not coming in at the moment at the same speed it was last year. No new money = no new tether

I'm not sure you are in the write reddit thread brother. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:13:40
There is a wallet software called Electron Cash. Install that to a computer and you can sweep your paper wallet and then either keep it on the computer (bad idea) Send to a hardware wallet or send to an exchange.
Keep in mind that Electron Cash isn't compatible with BIP38 encrypted Paper wallets so if your paper wallet requires a password, You will have to go to Bitaddress.org and enter your private key there, Then enter your BIP38 password and it will show you the unencrypted version of your private key. Paste THAT into Electron Cash and sweep the wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:07:12
You do realise that all the big exchanges will freeze your account if they suspect you of suspicious activity? Your "life savings" aren't lost, You will simply need to provide proof that Bitfinex's suspicions are unwarranted and they will unfreeze your balance.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:35:09
No worried brother, Yeah I was really stumped because all my wallets are bip38 and none of them would sweep. There isn't really any good documentation so it wasn't till I tried the bitaddress thing that I figured out the incompatibility. They might have updated the software by now though.
If you can't be bothered typing out the Private key in Bitaddress, There are plenty of QR code reader smartphone apps that you can use to scan then copy and paste the code in. I get that this isn't the most secure way to get things done but it worked fine for me when I was in a rush to get my coins to the exchange and dump them.

It does, Try sending a Segwit TX your self, You have to confirm both outputs individually 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:35:31
I don't use Stamp but withdrawing from ANY exchange generally attracts a fee. Its not that they are trying to profit from you, Exchanges used to always have free withdrawal and just eat the cost but because blocks are full these days, It got pretty expensive for them and they are all passing those fee's onto users (which is fair enough but its worth noting in your case)
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:40:50
I wouldn't put it in all at once, This Segwit 2x drama is going to cause a lot of volatility over the next few months so I would spread the payments (and your risk) over say... a 6 month period. I would put 50% into Bitcoin 40% into Ethereum and then spread the remaining 10% around in a few ALTs or ICOs you are passionate about that you have researched through and through

I didn't think the "joke" was funny or creative at all so I thought there must be more to it and thats why I didn't get it.

Well you're much smarter than me then, I never even finished school! Was it really that difficult though? What I mean is, The delay you experienced when you were getting set up, was that because you couldn't figure it out or was it more related to the wait for verification?
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:08:53
By your own explanation, Its self balancing! So it how would it be MORE profitable to mine?

@_date: 2017-10-27 11:15:21
Thats not what I mean, Those fees won't increase or decrease because its a percentage so wether you buy 500 worth now or 500 worth over 5 weeks, its going to be exactly the same because .25% of 500 is going to be the same no matter how long you take to spend it. What I mean is TX fees as in, Getting your TX on the blockchain, It usually costs around $1.50 to to an actual TX so if you do it in 5 seperate orders, you're going to be paying 1.50 x 5 to pull them off the exchange and into your wallet PLUS the fact that there will be 5 different outputs so it will be more expensive to send them from YOUR wallet to somewhere else. Best to just buy it in one order and pull it off the exchange in one TX. Hope this helps

Depending on what accountant you speak to: Because you arent actually cashing out your bitcoin, If you have held the BTC for longer than 12 months then you are buying a store credit directly in Bitcoin and as such; Will not be subject to capital gains tax.

@_date: 2018-04-03 10:47:22
Anti virus software looks for small pieces of code that is present in a known virus or malware. Each time a Virus is found, Its because the antivirus software detected this small sample of code, It then flags the software containing this code as malicious.
Basically, Some trolls put small snippets of code into the Bitcoin Blockchain, These snippets of code are from known Virus's and the idea behind the whole thing is to get Anti-Virus software to flag the blockchain as a Virus.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:27:51
Just for the lols dude, Trolls everywhere... Some guy put all these links to childporn images in the blockchain because they knew that its an immutable ledger and they couldn't be removed.

Its because Australia only has a few exchanges that you can deposit AUD into, There are many more people trying to buy than there are trying to sell...
Usually people will spot the price discrepancy and buy coins out of the us, Send them to Australia, Sell them on the exchange, and just keep doing it and making profit, Its called arbitrage... Problem is, Bitcoin is going up faster than it takes the wires to hit so no one is Arbing the price back down.

Maybe YOU could create (and verify) an account at BTC markets and have your tenants deposit money into it and then you could buy the BTC your self and transfer it back home.
Im not sure how BTC Markets feel about receiving money from an account that isnt in YOUR name.
Also, I used to depot money into my account by just going into a branch and giving them cash with my BTC Markets ID number as the reference number, The money would be in the account before I left the branch. I'm not sure if they still offer this service but thats an easy way for your tenants to deposit into your BTC markets account too...

$1,000 for the item
$600 for the capital gains tax
$200 for the VAT of the item because the person at the counter will be charging me $1200 for an item that's $1000
That's 80% $1800 is an 80% rise from $1000 Get it?

Sorry. I don't think I am explaining myself very well.
I want to buy a new PC, The shop wants $1000 for the computer so with the 20% VAT, They are going to charge me a total of $1200
That's $1000 for the boys in the shop and $200 VAT for the government.
I cash out $1000 of my Bitcoin profits to buy this new PC so I will owe $600  for capital gains tax for cashing out that crypto plus $200 VAT.
Im paying a TOTAL of $800 tax for an item that costs $1000
$800 is EIGHTY percent of $1000 so yeah... I'm paying 80% tax just to buy something with my crypto profits. Make sense?

Same thing. If you're looking to buy just ONE bitcoin, then you will be getting the same amount of tezos either way.

You're just one of those guys who wants to feel like they are contributing so you say annoying redundant and obvious things like "If you make money, You have to pay tax"  
Anyone capable of completing KYC and buying / selling Bitcoin should be aware of the fact that when you make money, You pay tax... You're contributions aren't required or needed. Thx...

I think he actually MIGHT be that stupid...

What does it matter if VAT is included in the list price or not? You are paying 20% more than the product is worth straight to the government for tax. If the list price is $1200 that means price of the product is $1000. It means the list price would be $1100 if VAT was only 10% it means a list price of $1050 if VAT was 5% and it means the list price would be $1000 if there was no VAT
How am I actually having to point this out to someone on a cryptocurrency sub... OMG... Dude...
Why do so many people on Reddit have to be like you? WWWHHHYYYYYYY?

Buy your bitcoin now, Leave it on the exchange and wait for your Ledger to arrive. You don't need to sign up or verify for anything to use a Ledger

Does that mean if I exchange BTC into a House (which is also an investment) then I don't have to pay CG Taxes and I get the house free and clear?
Not trolling, Legit question.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:25:17
Good... well buy it now, Its under $2200

Gold is measured in Troy Ounces.
31 Grams per Troy Ounce

No, Wait for it to go to 4000 before you buy.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:28:58
Or it has nothing to do with that at all and more to do with the fact that Bitcoin has been a big part of my life for the last 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:19:24
Bitcoin is extremely illiquid compared to most stocks and major corporations due to lack of ETF and institutional investors.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:50:08
I would assume it would be in USD
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:39:02
So you're saying that when someone who has been obsessed with Bitcoin for 5 years names something in a game after it, It means Bitcoin is overpriced? lol Dude, Sometimes I really don't get the people on Reddit...
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:14:16
No dude, YOU think I'm a Dr of Bitcoin not me, not anyone... Just you :)
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:37:27
LoL you are probs 100% correct. I didn't even think of that. Damn you for spoiling my narrative ;)
@_date: 2018-12-01 11:49:37
That was the next thing I tried. It works :)
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:17:21
Please quote. I don't think I literally said that at all.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:59:27
hahah what? Yes it is, All 1 ounce coins minted from the Perth Mint in Australia weigh 31 grams (1 troy ounce.)
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:54:08
Nope, Not at all... It's an Analogy.
Thats a big boy term that us adults use when we are trying to describe something to someone who might not completely understand what we are saying so we make a comparison to something else that the person might understand better.
It's a pretty good way of helping people to understand things that are a bit out of their depth. Its worth googling the term if you havn't heard of it before.
(EDIT: And no, before you ask... I'm not saying I'm an English teacher)

Think of it like this:
Its like someone who is in their first semester of medical school telling a fully qualified Dr something and when the Dr disagrees, He gets told "Think about it for half an hour and then it might make sense to you"
The Dr obviously isn't going to spend much time thinking about the opinion of some kid who has no idea, He is just going to dismiss it entirely. Get it?
