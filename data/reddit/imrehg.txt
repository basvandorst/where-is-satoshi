I'm saying that if our bitcoin vending machine is inoperable for 24+ hours because foolishly depended on Blockchain's wallet functionality, and have to turn people away, then it is not timely.
If i cannot pay my invoice in btc, because the company i need to pay implemented the blockchain merchant checkout, then again it is not timely.
Because both of these issues are currently ongoing for me.

What i meant was that i'd prefer to see an exchange where users' funds are under the users' control, and the balance is not just a number in a database. Something like multisig accounts, transactions on the blockchain, and fiat holdings are clearly separated as well. If both btc and fiat is per-user holding, would not need a liquidity proof because they would always have what they should have.
I know it is more difficult, and for other technical reasons might not be desirable, but cannot help thinking: every exchange where the balance is merely a database entry is just holding funny money, it's just Mt.Gox waiting to happen...

Great to see it's going well since the last time I talked to Allen (that's been a while).
Sounds like an interesting idea, potentially making the platform/hardware even more useful for the end user. Probably you can use Bitcoin for things for a bit, and see whether it's something that's interesting to you (check out existing tools, existing hardware, different use cases). If it is, just build it the way it feels your own product can help you too. If it isn't interesting for you, you probably won't be able to build something that's interesting for others either.

I'm on the ground here, as soon as I get out of work I'll go to the nearest Family Mart to verify. There's one right next door but it's still under construction. The next shouldn't be more than 5 minutes walk away.
I'm actually the tech guy on the ATM project he mentions in the video (a Lamassu), and really want to see how this works. Been doing that because there was nothing else. I really love that there are more and more ways to do these things!
**Update:**: I did try it out. The results are here on photos: 
Experience similar to what others mentioned:
* very convenient, start to finish is less than 5 minutes
* the spread is pretty high (6%, as opposed to the 1% mentioned in the video), better than the Lamassu we are running now (bit not for long, we are dropping it soon), and worse than [Maicoin]( (I used them quite a bit)
* the conversion is done not when you pay in the store, but online when you get to check out. I had the fee change while I was checking out. This might or might not be beneficial
* hidden fee of 5 TWD for receipt or something (online, above the 25 TWD service charge at the store)
I think I wont be using this because of the spread, but this is truly "magic internet money". I hope BTC adoption on the merchant side will follow so people can spend too...

Taiwan is often falling behind due to the "old" new money from those decades, and the remnants of the authoritarian culture. Crappy laws, inefficient and maddening bureocracy, no-can-do attitude on many levels. On the other hand, this does not fly with many in the new generation, and the influx of foreigners is slowly improving things (yeah, we do complain a lot)

Do you do that through Shopify's Bitcoin integration?
Just checked your site, but cannot find any mention of Bitcoin, and went pretty much all the way to "checkout" except for the payment and all I see is Paypal. So not even sure if Bitcoin payments are enabled if you hadn't announced it here.
By the way, you might want to add a blog to your site, sharing information through posts regarding to what are you doing (about your teas, bitcoin, anything) can be a good boost.

I'm using [Kiosk Browser Lockdown]( at the moment, mainly because it was a free app, but it does work pretty decent! Whitelisting pages, set it up so that it goes back to the beginning of the checkout easily for the next customer, PIN lock so the employees are not changing the settings around... So far so good.
[This]( was my experience with Coinbase at the one particular time when their app didn't work (out of the handful of times when they had service problems and outages while I was using them).

BitPay works mighty fine for me. Used to use Coinbase, but not anymore due to the experience with their customer service.
(Retail POS at two locations, and now another Shopify store)
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:29:52
Here's my previous experience:  
Since they post the only development is that upon review they dropped their accusations of me, haven't addressed the original problem still, and due to the original bug/problem I had to do half a month of transaction accounting by hand.
When their software works, it's pretty decent. When it doesn't, then &lt;insert deity here&gt; help you! In retail I'd rather plan conservatively for the worst expected cases. With Coinbase that worst case is not acceptable.
BitPay so far has a great customer service, proactive, helpful. Their code and services are developing, but so far "good enough", they take suggestions to improve them, and my conservative worst case so far is "things work as they did yesterday".
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:25:14

Having tried it out, the buying process is okay. Maybe I lower expectations after the lot of crappy BTC service I used so far. :) I could imaging a lot of improvements, but it's fine.
The comment about convenience store and being more expensive - that's an interesting view. I'm pretty sure that some other stuff are more than 5-6% more expensive than elsewhere, and I don't complain about that...  Maybe if they didn't charge the 25NT service charge it would be easier to take? I don't like such fixed offsets. Large markup only works for small amounts, but the fixed offset is bad for small amounts making the spread a lot larger (in my case ended up being something like 8% markup altogether).

@_date: 2014-04-20 16:05:29
Zooming in the screen says "Sorry, we are down for a moment!", which is a different message that our Lamassu [Taipei] says when sold out. I'd expect other problems, though this message is not readily familiar to me across all the troubleshooting I've done. Would guess network issues.

Lamassu has [two-way version]( already just we don't have it here in Taiwan. :)
Looking at the [BitOcean]( machine, it looks very "dictatorial" (I guess the dark metal features, big features, very industrial feeling). It looks "older" and more heavy-handed than many of our bank ATMs here.
I'd love to try out and see how it works. As an operator I think I'd still go with Lamassu and its different design.

Congrats on the release!
Need more currencies (TWD represent) and kiosk mode, at a minimum. Currently using the Coinbase Merchant app to do the same at two retail locations, and start to see what matters and what not that much (Coinbase has unreliable performance, so far the only downside; kiosk mode, transaction spreadsheet export, local currency, logo/name display in app are upsides).
Competition is good! I'm waiting fir someone to do a good merchant app with BIP32 support (so i don't have to do it myself), let's see what else people make!

The mind-blowing thing is that since it is not "money", not "currency", you are not technically a money transmitter...
Same thing I was checking over here in Taiwan. Foreigners have a list of activities they cannot start a company for, among others remittances - but since bitcoin is classified as a commodity here, doing what Western Union does but with bitcoin is not remittance, because it's not currency.
Awesome times. Hope they stay like this. :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:16:38
It's also worth to note, that you are not ever "transfering" a coin to another address. Instead destroy coins (on the input) and create 1 or more new ones (on the output). What you transfer is the balance, the coin (ie. the output of some earlier transaction) is gone after that.

Thinking about it, in that case the situation would show up as an "aborted buy/sell" on the person's Local Trader record. That might change things if there are a bunch of aborted transactions and none gone through. They have a star rating for the sellers, so probably feeds back to the rating....

yeah, when "I've never had a problem" myself it was pretty good! The best merchant app when it works, customizing the invoice, automatic transaction reports (and usable ones!), these are the stuff merchants care about. I thought I did my research when I worked with their stuff.
Now checked out others, and will be transitioning away, but it's not ideal. Worse reporting, web-based checkout, have to use another app for kiosk mode.... but if it give me fewer support runs to the retail location and the company doesn't make me feel like shit when I'm trying to help them with feedback and business, that will totally worth it!

Check that on the output side the same coin is spent 4 times (transactions that are included in the chain). It should not be possible to spend it more than once, and usually double spends are just twice. 4 times is crazy, wonder who and how did it do that...
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:55:31
It's even worse than that (as HSBC showed recently), 1-of-2 signature, but the bank can override yours (i.e. you can't pay) so it's more like "1-of-1 and ask us nicely". Similar thing is when my bank is flagging a transaction "for your safety". I made and blocking every subsequent one until I tell them in face-to-face that "yes, I did initiate that transaction."
Yup, the more I think about the more it is a 1-of-1 key where you don't have any.

nLockTime works with [GreenAddress.it]( as well. There you control half the keys (they use 2-of-2, as I understand), but they can't move your coins without your part of the key.

Huh? This does not make much sense, there's only one way for companies to go with bitcoin? Anyone care to elaborate?

I needed to give notarized to bitstamp too. So i didn't verify in the end.

First: congrats to Robocoin on the Chinese machine!
The Taiwanese part of the article is misleading. The official saying such things was refering to "ATMs" as they are defined by law for banks (ie. operated by banks, doing operations tied to people's accounts at banks). Just means that Taiwanese banks cannot operate these BTC machines.
Outside of banks companies are free to do all that. Source: i'm on the team running a Lamassu machine for 2-3 months now. It is the one-way model, but the legal requirements are the same.
As I heard Robocoin was trying to put one of their machine here even quite recently. Not sure what happened to that, though the location I heard about wouldn't have been too good.
Since January there were no new news really from the finance officials, so the old misunderstandings are being repeated unfortunately.

$5000/unit for 1-4 units, goes down with higher unit number.
Source:  and operating one of them over here in Taipei
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:06:53
The Lamassu we have in Taipei has an Ethernet connector on the case, but it's not connected inside. All communication is done over wifi, so I guess it's similar in this case as well...

I'm in Taiwan and love oolong. Hope you'll really enjoy this! :D

It's awesome that you guys are in Austria. I'm from Hungary, though jumped very far, Taiwan represent. None of those options really lend well to remote work. :)
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:25:49
Fair enough. Though it's a big difference, didn't expect multiple minutes, no matter how decentralized a network is for the miners.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:24:35
Well, building one locally anyways, see what happens. we have plenty of support, and hopefully big enough cojones...
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:05:55
I used both: Coinbase was terrible customer service experience for us, Bitpay was awesome so far, and that's what we are using for the time being.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:49:31
Our Lamassu machine (first in the country) was supposed to come online today, with press and all. Except it uses Blockchain.info as a wallet (tenporarily, mind you). Thus no coins nor press for the day for sure. Talk about high pressure and roller coaster. :)
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:23:14
Or how about not having any cold and hot wallets that combine the users' coins, but each user has their own wallet on the exchange? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:58:55
In the "forbidden" - quotation marks because it wasn't, and that's the whole point of the legal opinion, that "if you look into it, what is possible and not possible, is completely different than people mostly said".
Yes, people can trade bitcoin. And no, lots of financial institutions  (meaning banks, but not other companies) are banned from dealing with bitcoin.
So I'm really glad for the downvote for posting something that actually agrees with what you are saying. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:01:20
Cheers! Just in time for the new year preparations, I guess I print one, or two (or three) for relatives here :)

Well, then they would have been well received!

can add option of "had, but not anymore?" 
I'd really like to vote that.

And from this announcencement TIL that there's [BIP44]( which defines some good hierarchy using the BIP32 derivation scheme (that part I've used in other projects already)... Very interesting!

I can't wait until 7-11s in Taiwan start taking bitcoins, it's an institution here.  Apparently we have here the 4th highest density of 7-11s in the world - except that there are at least 3 other convenience store chains (Family Mart, OKmart, Hi-Life) that are significant competitors, witht their high density. When one starts, the others will follow - profit :)

Your links are the Chinese (i.e. in China) China Times.
This one is the English language Taiwanese magazine China Times, that has been bought by the Want Want group (itself China affiliated, and this deal started a lot of protest, but that's a tangent). So yes, it's "Want Want's China Times".
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:25:01
Ah, okay, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:01:13
Any takeaways from this event? What have you learned by talking to people?
Edit: looks great initiative, i'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:37:46
Yes, but not much. The majority of their cost was the 0.1mBTC transaction fee, almost taking up the entire transaction, even if there are 749 spam recipients (plus 1 change address). So yea, not 2x9c, but 2x7.5c total cost.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:32:09


Solution seems to be the same, though a *lot* of data in this case.

34th St - 2nd Avenue
It's shown on the video at the start, and in the description. From the video &amp; streetview, I'd think right at [this corner](
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:59:27
I just got an incoming transaction on Blockchain similarly. Now they've set up things even more, the transactions show up as "New Bitmessage" in the Blockchain.info Android app...
Screenshots: 
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:21:12
Nope, in the details you can see they actually had 0.0001BTC transaction fee (the "usual recommended", though definitely not enough for this many outputs.

@_date: 2014-03-30 08:45:16
Yes, by directly tying Paypal to my bank account - so they can empty the whole thing without any extra authorization from me... I've seen that, and thought probably not stupid enough to do that.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:41:46
If you come to Taiwan, we have ice cream for bitcoin, that's not bad either! :)
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:28:53
Really? I got the third person now, and I just feel shittier and shittier. I wonder why do they treat people who drive business to them, and cannot come up with a good answer.
Good for you, by the way, hope you have found a much better place!

If my [recent experience]( with Coinbase customer service is any indication - I'll keep far far away from them, especially when they are coming out with new stuff (YMMV)...
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:25:12
Not being in the US I couldn't link my bank account even if I wanted to, but before I used their merchant app to accept bitcoin in person (retail). For that it worked well when it worked. Then from "great" it got weirder and weirder by the week, culminating in a 2-3 week broken system and abusive customer service. Only used them because their merchant app was ahead the curve, but no-one needs this extra shit.
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:32:36
Would recommend BitPay, very simple and much better customer service than Coinbase. (source: been using Coinbase for 4 months at two retail locations, just transitioning away to BitPay)
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:17:27
Bitpay has a mobile checkout page, slap a "kiosk mode" app on and you get back the merchant app checkout - except better (more reliable, and you can have the same interface across device types, better customer service).
Source: 3 months of running Coinbase mervchant at two locations, switched to Bitpay a month ago and not looking back.

Here's all the info about the scripting system:  
For the lottery thing: maybe you can look around at the contracts page on the wiki.  If I think about your question, it looks like a multisig escrow kinds of thing, maybe the "Assurance contracts" section but with paying out not to yourself but to one of the payers, or the "Using the external state" section... 
Coming up with interesting, useful, new types of transactions is a good frontier for bitcoin IMHO now or in the near future, would love to see people coming up with more, like the lottery you mention! :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:54:19
The opinion was by the government regulator keeping the banks in check, and it hasn't changed: banks cannot have any bitcoin related business themselves. They have no power, nor interest regulating 3rd party (non-bank) services. Thus such machines were always fine. Also, this is not an ATM by the local definitions (and not because it's only TWD-&gt;BTC, Robocoin is not an ATM according to the rules either), so doubly fine.
It just takes a curious person (and a couple of lawyers) to untangle what is what. :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:58:42

As much as I like Electrum, this is a pretty complicated setup for a single page site, even more than Blockchain.info would be.

The English version was posted more recently (12/23), and this article was not posted here before. I'm here in Taiwan, and have not seen much written about the conference itself before, so I thought it's relevant.

@_date: 2014-10-16 12:36:14
Yeah, here I think localbitcoins and mycelium local trader semi-convenient, and there's also the Taiwanese bitcoin group, they have [meetup]( every sunday (mentioned in the video), and there should be always someone. If you are here a bit longer, then there are the exchanges (need bank account I guess).
There was a rumour a long time ago about a Robocoin coming here. Given the recent news, i'm not surprised that it didn't happen. Let's see... Would love to see a two-way Lamassu (I'm on the team running the current one-way one), but I wouldn't hold my breath for that...

I'd **love** to do that, and I keep asking stores here "do you take credit card? how about bitcoin?" but most places are cash only.
I do research into how a vendor's side would work technically, and I'm actively working on my retail friends, maybe one of them will break and start to accept bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:24:30

Exactly... Just been to a Wine Fair here in the middle of Taipei City, Taiwan. Supposed to be the land of 3G, I checked the coverage, nothing was working except the regular phone service. That's a place where I see a lot of commerce going on, and would have loved to buy some delicious wine with bitcoin, but even if there were any vendors, there was still no coverage. It's really easy to break 3G with crappy building.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:33:24
Yeah, fees are surely part of the equation, I just hope it will be more straightforward than now (often don't quite understand how things work, required and optional fees, outside and bitcoin-enforced ones, etc). Thanks, will have to check Virwox :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:31:26
I really hope this will mean that BitPay will move be available in more Asian countries with direct bank deposit.
Not necessarily for me, I'd keep funds in bitcoin for a while for sure to my suppliers as well if possible. But most businesses could use that sort of "certainty" of sure payout (instead of exchanges, especially since there are no working ones here in Taiwan yet, though I heard of 4 in development...)
