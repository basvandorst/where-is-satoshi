I will never think "It can't get any higher" again. It could hit 100k and if I had 5k to invest I would in a heartbeat.

I don't have good credit. Until recently, I've had quite bad credit, but I'm slowly fixing it.

You need money to do those lul

I heard this a lot back at $300 per coin.

And eventually rise again.

Sarcasm?

Yeah how many times has bitcoin crashed and stayed crashed for long? 
And anyway, you could say the same of any other currency in the world. The USD could be worthless someday. Gold could crash to nothing. Etc.

500 -&gt; 300 is only 40% down, and I thought it was over the course of many months it slowly went down. 
But that's besides the point because I'm wrong anyway, yeah it was 1000+ to ~250. 
But still, none of this matters. The only reason it crashing and staying crashed for a year would be a bad thing is if you're stupid and panic sell as soon as it goes down. In that case, you shouldn't be buying any crypto at all, or invest in anything at all.

Yeah my bad for having health issues
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:23:19


Because bitcoin is a horrible currency. Fees make it useless. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:04:29
500 -&gt; 300 is hardly a "crash" and a year is hardly "long". And I also said it would eventually rise again, I thought that's what you were referring to when you said "Thats what they said back then too" and was really confused.

And they were right? I'm not sure what your point is here. It *did* eventually recover and then some. Over 5000%.

Do you think that if we suddenly and magically had no need for police and fire fighters you'd pay less taxes?
You wouldn't. That money would just be allocated to expand our military even further.

Personally I'm tired of having bitcoin regret. I had it years ago when it was worth a few bucks and I looked back and it used to be *pennies*. Then I had regret when bitcoin broke 15 and I looked back to when it was worth only a dollar or two. Then I had regret with bitcoin hit $500 fucking dollars, god I'd be a millionaire. Then it hit $1000 and I nearly cried. Then when I heard of Ehtereum I decided I didn't want the same to happen with it, so I started buying it. Bitcoin was about $2000 at the time and I was sure it had done all the climbing it would do, no way I'd see significant returns any time soon. 3 months later it was $4500.

What value does Bitcoin have once everyone realizes it's worthless though? 
Before it had the potential to be an actual currency, but that dream is dead. Altcoins that work much better at being a currency have room to grow, but once everyone realizes bitcoin is just a "store of value" as people here like to put it, it's dead. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:32:08
It's literally only gone up in value. Until this day, if you invested into bitcoin and actually held instead of panic selling, you'd not lose money.

There's no reason whatsoever to cut the tip of your dick off. How is there a discussion to be had at all about this? 
Why are you pro-circumcision? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:17:31
There's a reason we do that though, because it's the way nature intended. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:21:06
The proper way to circumcise is by sucking the tip until the skin tears.
