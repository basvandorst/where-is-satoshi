Went on to buy .005BTC few days ago. Went with regular bank transfer and due to processing time I received .006BTC cause the price dropped over that 1-2days. 
I'm fine with that ◉_◉

Well the whole point of bitcoin hodling is based on "should have" and "could have" isn't it?
I'm very aware that the price can/will drop even more.

I'm not talking about ricing either. I'm talking about performance tuning. Upgrade turbo chargers etc.
I bet you have something that you really like too and want to improve it even further.
Hell what would we do if we didn't have passion for something.

You don't even have to.
If a PC costs $2k+ you might aswell spend ~$100 for proper lighting as I would consider it to be a luxury item at this point. 
People like to tune their cars and other people like to "tune" their PCs.

Oh I didn't know! Thanks for the heads up.

Well there's still a lot of use for btc as a currency. Buy btc, wait a few days, buy a lot more with it than you initially could.

Your last sentence had me giggling. At this point I won't even be surprised if it goes down to 6k or rise to 30k during the next week. 
Everything is possible and I'm happy that I'm part of this journey.

I've never said it'll be infinite. Right now that's the case. I don't have any experience with stock trading or investing smart. But I used to trade Ingame items in steam and items that are rare or getting bought up to minimize the supply went up in price. 
That market is obviously way more likely to get manipulated but I think we can see something similar with BTC atm. It's just the other way around. Not the items (BTC) are getting bought up to minimize the supply but the buyers are increasing rapidly. If everyone decides to sell a month on its gonna go down again. That's for sure.

Hm you're right. I don't think it's possible to revert the transaction. Kinda strange circumstances tbh. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:21
ofc it'll go down. But if the price is low enough the same people will buy in again and lower prices will probably attract even more people.
Holding isn't always the right option. It's just the easiest one.

I'm so angry about my 100% gain ��������
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:49:23
I guess the main reason are chargebacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:06
It'll be corrected 100%. But if I were you.. *pshhh*
