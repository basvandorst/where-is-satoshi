We would like to provide a decent answer to this. But with the hostility already shown, with no understanding of what it means to be a market maker. I think it would be better if you spoke directly with BIPS' CEO ?

You might be interested in what [BIPS]( has to offer.
They do have their Affiliate Bitcoin Program running for quite some time now, and you simply create your referral link at the consumer side of BIPS,  and refer merchants (Online stores, retail businesses) to the merchant side of BIPS 
Provide the merchants examples of how easy it is by showing them this,  and tell them 0% Payment Processing Fees.
Leaflets are being created by  with sponsor support from BIPS!

Hi, it means that with the approval from Amazon as the world’s first Bitcoin Point of Sale Merchant app being listed, accepting Bitcoin is now available on even more devices.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:39:43
Yes and with the approval from Amazon for this Bitcoin Point of Sale Merchant app being listed. It will hopefully give plenty of good Bitcoin exposure to merchants owning say a Kindle.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:03:35
Should work with 1.5, if not lets us know as we made both the BitPay and BIPS plugin for the good of the Bitcoin community even though we are competitors.

Think remittance.
In 2012, according to the World Bank Report, $401 billion went to developing countries (a new record) with overall global remittances at $514 billion.
Try and deduct western union or moneygram fees and compared this to the Bitcoin fees.

It happens automatically, you simply add a payment account, in this case PayPal and upload standard KYC and each time you make a sale in Bitcoin, you will receive USD in your PayPal.

The app is free, and you can use it to accept bitcoin payments point of sale in retail businesses or similar.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:16:54
We are in the process of implementing "sendmany" to save on network fees for merchants, when they choose to forward all bitcoins.
Bitcoin settlements are up and running again after a brief downtime, which was necessary to make it better. Automatic conversion was not affected.

@_date: 2014-02-02 18:56:06
There are more worst-case scenarios. That with 97% offline they don't broadcast the transactions right away, hence BitPay and BIPS invoices do not get paid within the 15 minutes time frame. A recurring issue we are working actively on, however very hard to solve.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:47:31
How about simply:
    Hi "Company", I would love to pay with Bitcoin for "...". Are you implementing this?
    Services such as  or  can handle the bitcoins for you and just pay you in sterling, euros, or dollars in your bank account.

@_date: 2014-03-16 07:17:17
Thank you for suggesting us! We do in fact have the solution the OP might need.
Both Android app and HTML5 web app.
If you simply convert to local currency, the bar will never see the bitcoins, and can receive bank transfer at the end of the day without having to worry about security as the bitcoins are already converted and out of the system.
As  said, there is a 0% Payment Processing Fees on BIPS.
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:53:30
We found it here.
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:52:46
I think you'll need something like BIPS for real-time conversion if you don't want the exchange risk. For retail businesses just wanting to keep bitcoins, it's awesome +1!

Statement from current CEO:
We deeply regret the incident back in November and we have since taken several steps to ensure that similar attacks can not happen again. Thus, we no longer use a wallet service as part of our product portfolio.
We're sorry on behalf of those who have lost Bitcoin and we assure that we are doing what we can to find solutions for all.
We would like to improve our communication about the progress we are making together with the police authorities and for those who want a dialogue with us, I want to make myself available.
All are welcome to write to me on my mail &lt;email removed&gt;
Sincerely Hans Henrik H. Heming; CEO

You should have told them about the possibility of using a bitcoin point of sale app, so they could convert directly and simply open the app when required. No overhead.
But I take it when they already removed the bitcoin payment option, that they probably wasn't keen on listening to sales talks.
Anyhow for other businesses that might be interested in accepting bitcoin, simply point them to BIPS POS
What we do here in Denmark is set up bitcoin meetups each month, drink and eat at the places accepting bitcoin. So this might be an idea ?

What makes BIPS different is that there are no fees for payment processing.
