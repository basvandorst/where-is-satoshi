Yes. I sold all my Bitcoin yesterday and invested on litecoin. Futures market traders will bet against bitcoin and stop volatility of bitcoin price.

Hold it strongly. Tomorrow bitcoin will hit $100000. Ha ha ha....... . Just eat some grass...........
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:07:06
It might go back to $1 again , who knows. Bitcoin had a massive price growth from  $.65  cents to $20000, in you whole life you will never see this types of growth in any real asset . Some lazy cunt and a group of fraud people already made money .  Eventually , this market will  collapse badly soon. Good luck...

It's a technology man. If you hold , you will end up as a beggars soon. Bitcoin worth actually nothing , yes block chain technology is the main thing. Step by step price will go back to it's original value. Are you serious ? Just sale and run. Sale sale and sale or regret later.

Once bitcoin hit between $4000 to  $5000 , then we can say this crash over. worse crash coming soon.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:32:30
I think Bitcoin will hit  $7500 by tomorrow.  Who knows? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:43:04
Huge correction coming. $1000 not too far. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:26:00
I already sold my bitcoin , now waiting for more crash. I think bitcoin will hit $8000, after $7500 then straight to $4500. After I will start buying . I am sure more crash is coming soon within 24  hours . Keep you money sitting on exchange then after a hard crash you will be able to buy truck load of cheap bitcoin . Good luck friends.

Finally , crooks are happy to see this crash. Some crooks still giving negative comment on media. Like bitcoin should be worth $20 like this . Actually, these crooks also had bitcoin and they sold it on hype. Now , only holders only paying prices. I personally , do not have any bitcoin and i sold it when it was $20000, but It's really bad to see this crash and negative comment . Bitcoin price wentup because people bought it .

@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:33
You people still holding . Don't think price will go up again now. You are  loosing whatever you left yet. Just sale and run . Run run and run.......
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:44:10

@_date: 2018-03-16 13:52:15
Too risky to touch , This market no more for investment . Fucking hail situation. It's hungry mad dog.....
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:05:10
It looks same like past bitcoin crash still I can remember. Bitcoin was $10 , after crash it was $3. A hard crash is on it's way. Bitcoin might hit bellow $4500 toady, may be more. 
like this soon. Get out now. save u self  from huge loss. Don't hold. It's a fucking big correction going on . 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:04:38
These crooks already sold of their bitcoin. They secretly waiting for more crash and buy whole lot again.

Hold on. Some one will come with green candle soon. Warren Buffett.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:29:15
if consolidating failed then straight to hell  means $6000 mark my friend. So 50-50 chance . Looks like bitcoin would not able to break resistance level and then all of you know where should we go. Bang bang .....it's same like 2013 bitcoin pattern 1/3 easy . means bitcoin might hit $6500 soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:28:02
Bitcoin $5500 next week.
Bitcoin $ 4000 last of this month.
Bitcoin  $1500 to $2000 panic sale ...
Less than $1000 after 
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:59:25
Worse correction coming soon.  $6000 soon.
