It really depends on what kind of debt. Credit card debt at &gt;20%, sure fucking thing. Home loans, fuck no. Government subsidized cheap loans at a few percents, def fucking no.
Anyway, everyone, just stay liquid, and be aware that you're not *investing*, you're *speculating*.
My psychological approach to speculating is: The moment I start speculating with money, it's *gone*. Poof. So I only do it with money I'm okay with going *poof*. Also saves me a lot of grief and stress later on.

What exactly is the relationship between transactions and blocks? I thought the two were one and the same, but there are suggestions that a block can contain multiple transactions?
I'm not sure I understand - for the protocol to work, we need a globally accepted ordering of all transactions, and each transaction must be signed off by the majority of the mining network as being in a determined position in the transaction chain.
If there are multiple transactions in a block, and miners validate blocks, then how do we know the order of transactions within a block?

It points out the ridiculous nature of the OP's attempted joke / argument quite well.
The most dangerous lies are half-truths. This maxim as presented by the op is true, but has no bearing at all on the blocksize debate. Choosing short-term comfort (immediate cheaper transactions) over sustainability is bad for everyone (except speculators and Btc opponents).
It has nothing to do with UX at all. It's a backend debate - the realm of pure science and logic.

Yes, I do agree that miners aren't almighty, but Bitcoin users do not need "large companies such as Coinbase" as a "proxy" to wield their power.
If miners under*mined* the currency, Bitcoin holders would sell their Bitcoin, and move to an alternative crypto where miners are honest. Therefore, the wealth a malicious miner cartel could arbitrarily generate would become destroyed by market forces.
Technically, miners *are* king within a single blockchain. The reason they aren't *actually* king is that the blockchain is not the entire world.
*We don't need big companies meddling in the politics of Bitcoin. What's next?! Bitcoin FED, owned by JP Morgan Chase, FedEx, Citi, and the Rothschild Family Fund?*

Bitcoin doesn't want or need anything. It's a tool, used by people who need this particular tool. People who don't want Bitcoin should not use Bitcoin. Those people may start to use on-line payment processors and whatnot that are and will be built *on top of* Bitcoin.
If you destroy Bitcoin in order to "make it palatable" first, people won't have any power left by the time they become invested. You don't hand control of the ocean over to the (currently) biggest boat.
ADD: The main thing I do not understand being, if you are against democracy and decentralization, what is it in Bitcoin that makes you care about whether it gets adopted or no? If you think decentralization has failed, why don't you just abandon Bitcoin? US Dollars and proprietary financial services built on US Dollars can do everything Bitcoin can, except decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:44:49
Best? Better than what? There's a reason we don't carry gold coins in leather pouches anymore.
The very reason gold was adopted as money was that it was scarce, recognizable and almost indestructible. (Which is where the 'mystical properties' I mentioned channel into the question.)
There are other scarce materials that have never been adopted as money, and still command ridiculous prices. (Such as, for example, the *milk* of the common mouse *mus musculus*.)


I don't see what you mean by this analogy. A Tesla car is valued because it has high build quality and society sees it as a status symbol (and yes, one of the reasons for the latter include that it has an electric motor).
They are also scarce compared to Nissans and Mazdas.

Let's handle the whole censorship-gate thing and the Bitcoin Protocol as separate questions.
Yes, acting overly antagonistic and dictatorial can result in a backlash, but I'd risk saying that the people who even *know* about this whole soap opera (let alone *care*) are less than 1% of the active users of Bitcoin...
As for the actual design of the Bitcoin Protocol, and its evolution, I fully support the way Core is doing their job.
ADD: As for how much people are "upset" about transaction fees, the **most popular** Bitcoin wallet collects a per-transaction "royalty" that is equal to the common miner transaction fee... That's a 100% increase.. most people don't even notice.

"Never selling below breakeven" just means "never selling", if nobody will buy from you at breakeven. There will be plenty of people selling below YOUR breakeven - others who are more efficient, and others who are selling at a discount to cut their losses.
If Bitcoin price is high, it makes sense to mine with immense hashing farms. If Bitcoin price dropped, miners who suddenly became unprofitable would simply *stop mining*.
(Also note that the supply of Bitcoin is *fixed*, regardless of how many people mine it, and with what.)

Well, I wouldn't be so certain. Big money has an inherent dislike of (actual) democracy and distributed systems, so there is a risk they might either 90% the network by investing in hashpower, or build their own proprietary blockchain.

Gold is valued because it's scarce. (Combined with its 'mystical' properties - it's the color of the sun, and is chemically inert.)
Gold miners compare the price they can get for the mined gold and the cost of mining it. If this equation comes out as profitable, gold will be mined - with whatever equipment it takes to get it.
Taking a quantum jump in extraction technology due to high prices can, however, dent scarcity, and in turn collapse price (as happened with shale gas and oil extraction).
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:36:46
Yes it does.
Gold in the Americas wasn't particularly scarce, given the geography containing many easily accessible gold veins (gathering it was easy, and it was found in many places), thus native American civilizations didn't value it as much as European and Asian civilizations.
When European settlers arrived, the high European value of gold for them was a given. So for the European gold diggers, the return on investment on the extraction of gold was much, much higher than for Native Americans, so in turn they used more expensive equipment to extract even harder-to-reach reserves.
So the value drove the increased expense in extraction.
However, to begin with, value and scarcity were linked. In Europe, mining gold was always pretty hard (due to fewer and less accessible gold deposits), thus gold was scarcer AND mining it was more expensive.
So the point is, you cannot create a direct causal link between value and the expense spent to mine it. These things affect each other:
It's scarce because you cannot mine it without spending a lot of money. It's expensive because it's scarce. People spend a lot of money to mine it because it's expensive.  It's scarce because you cannot mine it without spending a lot of money.
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:00:33
Why on Earth do you even need Bitcoin then? You don't. Just use US Dollars or Euros or whatever else. Why are you even *interested* in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency? Crypto IS about distributed and democratic. If you don't want that, you don't want crypto. The whole fiat world caters to your tastes.
(Unless you're a Coinbase shareholder, and hope to oust the Fed. In which case, you'll just fail, sorry. Fed is too big, and a Bitcoin under your control would just be a shitty version of the US Dollar.)

There is nothing to gain from using PoW, except for a few extra centigrades of global warming.
I really doubt China wants to ban Bitcoin itself - more likely they want to closely control its use. Keeping and centralizing Bitcoin mining in China will give the Chinese government the ability to actually *rule* Bitcoin, globally. All Bitcoin, everywhere.

They are a problem for the status quo only. They are disruptive. Disruptive doesn't mean they spell the end of civilization, it only means they spell the end of an era.
In fact, crypto is similar to cash. For a long time, there was no bank money, only cash. Still governments could operate, taxes could be collected. Yes, there was more room for "creative accounting" than in a fully centralized bank money system, but to me, it's not a cash economy that seems disastrously anarchic, it's the centralized bank money system that seems dystopian.
Crypto only brings balance to the force, a move toward decentralization in face of a massive push toward centralization.
And no, I'm not an ancap, nor particularly invested in "small government" ideologies, but I am definitely against all forms of total control. A world without crime would be a literal hell - because who decides what is crime and what isn't? There are lots of things that are considered crimes, and yet to me seem completely harmless or even positive. If Bitcoin allows people in backward countries access to medical weed, for example, that's a moral good.
Also, you don't have to assume that people will always try to cheat on taxes. Sure, there will be some who try, and you will need a tax authority to enforce tax rules, but if the tax code is fair and clear, most people will understand the importance of having a civilization, and will willingly pay for it. In Switzerland, some years ago there was a referendum whether to decrease taxes to distribute surplus, and people voted against it. They decided it's better to have a country that has a reserve than to pay less taxes.
So yes, crypto poses problems for bureaucrats with hopes of orwellian control. It poses problems for people who dream of a world straight out of the movie Minority Report. It poses problems for unfair tax regimes. But it's these things that should give, not crypto.

Ideally, a bitcoin "coin" should be made of resilient but relatively cheap metal. Minted in two halves, with the private key embossed on the inside. The halves should then be fused under a press in a way that ensures that an opened coin cannot be undetectably put back together.

The idea that Bitcoin might endanger the viability of schools and hospitals is so ludicrous that I cannot even. Cryptocurrency is just "better cash". Income taxation was implemented when people still used cash for everything. And public budgets did in fact exist before income taxation.
You can hide money movements from the tax authority, but you cannot hide a new home, a lambo, or an entire company.
As for the government shutting down crypto, it's so decentralized that there is nothing they can do about it. Sure many people won't use it if it's illegal, but others will, maybe out of pure civil disobedience because they find the ban oppressive. They can shut down exchanges, but nobody can shut down two people meeting in a cafe or park to exchange crypto for fiat or goods.
And anonymity and fungibility features will help doing that, so they ARE the right path.
Crypto will either result in a *revolution* of self-sovereignty, or it's completely pointless. And I'm not saying we should overthrow governments l'art pour l'art, I kinda enjoy living in an actual civilization, but governments are pushing for more and more control, so we need to be constantly pushing back and wresting control back from them.

Societies that didn't, or don't have this are remembered and known as hell on earth. Nazi Germany, the USSR under Stalin, North Korea, etc...

Your argument was "it won't happen because the government won't allow it". I quoted examples for how "the government" is powerless against popular grassroots change.
I could have added "Trump will never be elected president because the political elite won't allow it", and regardless whether one condiders Trump's presidency a bane or a boon, that *was* a widely, and almost dogmatically held belief, even among Trump's own supporters. They were totally gearing up for explaining away defeat.
You wrote a long and winding pamphlet against cryptocurrency in the spirit of Jamie Dimon &amp; co. I pointed out that this only means that cryptocurrencies are revolutionary, not that they will fail.

The article is... well... okay it's shite.
I'd bet money on it that most actual fake news about crypto come from within the crypto community.
Interesting how all the fake news cited were about Ethereum and not Bitcoin - they might totally have come from a Bitcoin maximalist troll upset by the gains of Ether against BTC.
Even within the Bitcoin community, there's plenty of infighting over soft-, and hardforks, with people who are bored enough and passionate enough to start writing fake news to bring the "enemy" down.
We really don't need banks to do our shitposting for us, we manage alone. Now of course the banks do try to attack cryptocurrency in the news, but not through shitty fake news, but expert opinion pieces carefully warning the reader of the "massive risks", both financial and legal, that using crypto poses.

You know, revolutions were all opposed by the government.
"Why will the Americas never secede from Great Britain? Because the Empire will never allow it, as this would greatly reduce tax revenues..."
"Why France will never be a republic? Because the king won't allow it!"
"Why Russia will never be Communist? Because that would greatly compromise the positions of the Tzar and the nobility..."
"Why slavery will never be abolished in the United States?"
"Why the Berlin Wall will never be brought down?"

...anyway, here's why soft money is better for the poor. Hard money is deflationary. Ie. if you have money (are rich), it grows in value. If you have debt (are poor), it also grows in value.
Your father bought a farm for a loan, now that loan is worth more than the farm, even though you probably paid half of it back since! Because of deflation.

Talk to a lawyer who's an expert in taxation in your country.
They probably won't know about crypto, so you need to look into what crypto counts as in your country:
* It probably counts as a commodity in lack of extra legislation.
* In many jurisdictions, it counts as a security.
* In a very small number of countries (one or two afaik), it counts as a currency.
If you know that, a tax expert will know the rest.

But I said it many times already. If the only thing existing in the world was money movement, if humans, buildings, factories, companies, land, food didn't exist in physical form, then sure, an untraceable money movement system would make taxation impossible.
However, the physical world exists and we are living in it. Money movement is only a very small component of a taxable business transaction. Also, money at some point is spent for physical benefits, which are by definition not decentralized and not anonymous. You can't have an anonymous lambo or an anonymous mansion. At the very least you're physically driving it or living in it.
Even a hundred years ago, people conducted business by physically giving each other bills or even gold bullion. Yet, companies were required to conduct strict accounting on paper, and present it to the tax authority. That way, even though money movement was not directly traced, taxable transactions were traced.
And they will be, even in a world with decentralized, anonymous, fungible cryptocurrency.

When they use it to buy fiat or property, they have to identify themselves. They will need to prove where all that money comes from. Laundering crypto from unknown sources is not in the least easier than laundering cash from unknown sources - which is what organized crime has been doing for a hundred years now.


I fail to see how rich drug dealers (which already do exist in huge quantities) might spell the end of Western civilization. I don't even consider drug dealers an issue, they are just traders dealing in high-risk goods. (The whole drug addiction moral panic is just a way of blaming a symptom for fundamental issues in our civilization, but that's totally beside the point for now.)
Sure, organized crime, with all the violence and tax evasion IS an issue, but that's because of the state forcing industries underground. Organized crime as we know it was literally *created* by the (liquor) Prohibition in the US.
Anyway, think of a mafia head who has millions in gold and unmarked cash stored under false names or stashed safely in unknown locations. How is that different from crypto? It cannot be seized if it isn't found...


There exist other potential ways to improve market efficiency of a national economy. Even without monetary freedom, fiscal freedom is quite enough for quite a lot of things. And I wouldn't fear for bloody China. China will probably still exist as China when our "Western civilization" will only be a topic in history books next to Hellas and the Roman Empire.


You can put it that way. It's there to limit overreach by governments. I see that as a **good** thing, while you keep saying it's bad. We won't agree if we don't agree on basic premises.
Also, crypto can be something like gold. A globally accepted store of value, that is used in parallel with local fiat for international settlement, secure savings, in cases when local fiat and/or the state as a whole is compromised (war, hyperinflation, etc.).
It's gold 2.0.

My opinions on taxation are complex. Some things aren't taxed nearly enough in my opinion, others are taxed too much. Still this isn't a debate about whether taxation is good or necessary or about what should be taxed how much.
You are making patently false assertions about the potential impact of an untraceable distributed ledger on the viability of taxation. The world is a lot more complex than you think. And even if some forms of tax do become harder to implement, others can still replace them.

I wasn't even mentioning Bitcoin per se. We're talking about inflationary and deflationary (soft and hard) currencies, in general. BTC is special in its decentralized nature, but it's deflationary in the exact same way as gold / gold backed money is deflationary. There is nothing special about how Bitcoin is deflationary.
Also, I wasn't coming up with doomsday scenarios, I explained a historic scenario that actually plagued poor farmers in the XIX. century United States. And yes, they were being paid in the exact same deflationary Dollars that they were indebted in, just not being paid enough...

Never said "without taxes". It's two separate things.
First, not even 100% cryptocurrency adoption would stop taxation. Most people actually enjoy not having to hunt for food and kill other people routinely to protect their food, ie. we're kind of invested in having all this civilization stuff. So we'll keep paying taxes.
Also, even if money movement is decentralized, tax authorities can still track economic activities in the real world.
And second, income tax is not the only form of tax. There's sales tax, value added tax, wealth tax, land tax, trade duties, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:29:28


That is simply not the case. If you spend a lot of money, the tax authority fully has it in its power to investigate where it came from. If you buy a skyscraper for two hundred million in unmarked $20 bills delivered in black suitcases, do you think you get off jack free?


YES THAT IS WHAT I MEAN. SOCIETY NEEDS ROOM FOR CERTAIN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. A SOCIETY WITHOUT ANY CRIME IS A DYSTOPIA THAT NOBODY SHOULD REALLY EVER WANT.
And if you are triggered by the word "nazi", then substitute it with "bolshevik". Or "Orwellian".

Mathematical proof that all cloud mining sites are scams:
1. Let's assume that service operators are rational (try to gain the highest return from their investments.
2. It is known that crypto mining, when done in a large enough farm, provides reliably deterministic returns.
3. Let's posit that at least one cloud mining service exists that isn't a scam.
4. This means that the price a subscriber pays the service provider is lower than the amount of crypto they can mine with the server.
5. In this case, it would be rational for the provider to mine crypto themselves, as opposed to providing a service.
6. This is in contradiction to (1), thus the assumption that non-scam cloud mining exists lead to a paradox (making it an impossibility).
Also note that mining doesn't need marketing / customer acquiry, which makes it even *less* profitable (more irrational) to run an honest cloud mining service as opposed to just mining crypto for yourself.

No need to be impressed, this is a place where a lot of people fetishize deflationary currency. Personally I'm on the side of decentralized currency, and don't care much for deflation or inflation either way. Both have their problems, both should be relatively low on the long term.
I am worried that Bitcoin's deflation is going to stay extremely high, even when it stabilizes, but I'm not here to attack BTC over its money supply decisions.

Up until the point where you use it to buy a yacht or a position in a company, or something. Which is what really counts.


No, it really doesn't. Even if it *were* true, it wouldn't come even close to threatening "modern society as we know it today". It would actually help conserve it against those who wish to destroy it in the name of control and security.


You should read up more on this topic, because money supply and living costs should not be confused. It's a very complex and involved topic.
Yes, deflationary currency clearly favors lenders over borrowers, ie. the rich over the poor - which is why poor farmers in early XX. century USA violently opposed the gold standard. In this manner, Bitcoin as a dominant currency would pose problems for the poor.
Also, monetary freedom is an important power of countries to position themselves in the world market, and loss of this freedom can be very damaging, as seen in the case of Greece with the Euro. So Bitcoin supplanting local fiat entirely would definitely mean problems for poorer countries. Still, there is no reason for Bitcoin to fully supplant local fiat. Gold does exist, and is widely used, but it's not destroying the economy of Bangladesh.
(And all this has nothing to do with living costs. The Euro is used in both Monaco and Bratislava, and yet life in Bratislava is significantly cheaper.)

I don't think this is about being at the lowest price. Nobody is saying bear market is over. It may as well continue on for a while. Last low was $180, so if we consider that, bottoming out above $180 is still an uptrend in the macro timeframe. (Definition of an uptrend is "increasingly higher lows".)
The point is that Bitcoin has had larger drops than this in bear markets, and always resumed the uptrend... and if you believe in the concept and the vision, there is no reason to be disillusioned by the fact that we're in a bear market.

"We don't know who struck first. Us or them. But we do know it was us who cut the money supply. At the time, they were dependent on mining revenue. It was believed they would be unable to survive without a source of cashflow as abundant as early block rewards. Throughout crypto history, we have been dependent on mining conglomerates to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."

First of all, I believe in cryptocurrency in general and in Bitcoin specifically. I think proof of work was a good decision when Bitcoin was developed, and currently the safest consensus mechanism for a truly public blockchain.
That said, this here sounds like tobacco companies trying to advertise the health benefits of smoking in the 1940s, 50s...
I hope that fully decentralized alternatives to proof of work will grow up to be as safe, or safer, and then we can finally forget this whole issue.

I'm not saying the figures are inaccurate. I'm saying that we're literaly throwing away power that could heat homes and create food for people, and thus while renewable is better, it's still bad.
If all those renewable sources would be used for something else than mining, a lot of fossil fuel plants could be shut off entirely and for good.
I'm speculating on the rise of Bitcoin just as much as some PoS coins, so I have no personal agenda... beyond being a human being living on the planet Earth as a biological organism, and need both energy to maintain my life through heating and growing food, and the natural environment in a stable, habitable state so it doesn't accidentally kill me. From which perspective, PoW is pretty bad no matter what new angle I look at it from.
