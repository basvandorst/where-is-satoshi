That doesn't even remotely make sense. Since when does reddit have a pro-apple circlejerk that gives you "sweet, sweet karma"? Every time I mention I have an iphone shit gets controversial.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:41:17
Exactly. No rebuttal, just a down vote. What a dumbass. In reality, the "circlejerk for sweet, sweet karma" is to hate on apple at any and every opportunity
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:20:00
don't be a twat. 


I'm browsing just like you, I know what bitcoin can do. You're still making a huge exaggeration. It's all so ridiculously and horribly sensationalized. "The apple empire will bleed out.." Oh fuck off, seriously.

Libertarians and AnCaps alike know that there are huge differences between rand's statist philosophy, objectivism, and their own. 
Only idiots claim that it is a "libertarian" currency. It may be great for libertarians, but you cannot own a currency. That's a big part of libertarian ideals, after all: competing currencies that are not owned or controlled by one entity. 
So you've just been bullshitting your way through this entire 'argument'. It's really sad

I don't think you understand how dumb you sounded when you said "some of is are doctors, lawyers, have twitter followers".

I'm not laughing. I think there really is something wrong with you. We're you dropped? I'm not even trying to be mean

What's the benefit of the COG thing? Also, I just put my public address into Bitwallet and it immediately showed my bitcoins and I can send and receive through it... Is that safe? Can someone else do it to other people's bitcoins? Is it because the bitcoins are actually in my phone? I'm a grandpa when it comes to bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:47:30
No, we're not in agreement. You seem to have very poor reading comprehension. Did you pass the fourth grade? Right after that I said that one of the main principles of libertarianism and currencies is that one group cannot 'own' a currency. I don't even think you know what money is. Those who are stupid enough to say that libertarians want to own the bitcoin currency  (this is literally impossible) are the minority, but they're people like you. Any libertarian that claims to want to own a currency or have it to themselves is not a libertarian. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever that they want bitcoin to spread yet they want to claim it as their own. It's a stupid idea conceived by you. Really amazing how you are so dim that you completely ignore the sentence where I say that owning a currency is completely against their ideologies.

Joe rogan tweeting about bitcoin relates to "some of us have twitter followers" how exactly
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:04:48
You're the only one here claiming bitcoin is "for libertarians". You're right in saying that the argument is stupid, because it truly is. The subreddit links to and because they are groups of people that wish to promote the use of bitcoin. They want as many people as possible to use bitcoin. What are you even trying to argue? The only thing I can really gather is that the fact that AnCaps and libertarians /like/ bit coin and are supporters of it really rustles your jimmies. To an alarming degree. We're just a arguing the same points over and over, this is a waste of my time.

No one is on the other side of that argument, cretin
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:43:06
Get over yourself. Ever thought that Apple might think getting involved with bitcoin could be risky for them? Apple, for all you know, may believe that bitcoin may fall at some point and the uninformed wi blame apple since they were using it through them. Every thought of that, or do you always jump immediately to your "they know the storm is rising" bullshit??

Do you like Bitwallet a lot more than other iOS wallets like Pheeva?

LOL, how is this even relevant
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:45:34
Awesome! Been subscriber to for awhile now, looks like I'll be using bitcoin for the first time now.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:03:02
I agree with you 100% and honestly think it's a matter of time before Apple gives in. But I don't know what this guy is talking about, saying that there's a pro apple circlejerk alive and well on reddit. Maybe on apple specific subs..
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:27:25
Ah okay, that's good. I guess I should try putting in my private key then

That's right, Suppy does not create Demand. Rather, Demand can lead to the creation of supply.

I love bitcoin but GODDAMN you fuckers sound so angsty when you say that Apple not allowing bitcoin apps (For now, unless we have a psychic among us that can tell us that in the future they will not as well) means that the "Apple Empire" will "bleed to death".

If you come to a bakery to bitch about bread you're gonna have a bad time. Ideals and philosophies are everywhere, especially in places dedicated to discussing something so new and different like this. You're being unrealistic by asking everyone who disagrees to fuck off and frankly you're doing a very childish job at proving your points. Why don't you fuck off? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:20:34
Take a look at this one, he puts himself in a position high enough so that he decides where people can discuss things. You guys have to fuck off to because he doesn't like your way of thinking. You either agree with him or must be deported to a subreddit of his choosing. Watch your mouths, everyone!
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:56:06
Yup, since everyone is being targeted OP is just anti apple circlejerking. Isn't this not @_date: 2013-12-23 23:24:52
I had a huge argument with someone who claimed all Muslims are evil. All 1.6 billion of them. This guy claimed to be a libertarian. So much for individualism.. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:29:42
Rand was not a libertarian, nor was she an anarcho capitalist. She despised libertarians. History lesson for No one said its a libertarian or anarcho capitalist currency. But guess what! An alarming number of its supporters think it is great for their causes. So when you say "maybe they should stop allying their currency with their political system", what does that really mean? That they're not allowed to because it annoys you? Because I'm sure you also have political beliefs, and I'm sure you also stand by things that support your view or are a product of your view or can benefit your view. So should they really "fuck off" in a subreddit that is mostly them because they annoy you? You're like a small child having a tantrum. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:17:47
You don't seem to see that a lot of people that support bitcoin hold these views. Bakery and fried chicken? No relation. Bakery and cake? Yes. The people who don't see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme see it as a real currency. A good number of those people are libertarians and AnCaps. You know this yet you defy all reason and logic by coming here with the express purpose of fighting people (you stated that) and yet you still think you have the right to get upset when they hold views you don't agree with. Please, I really can't take you seriously.
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:17:18
That seems to be OP's view.
