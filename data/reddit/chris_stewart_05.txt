From the paper: 














There does seem to be ambiguity of what the 'set of signers' is, as a block header is not signed per se. 


No, we need to soft fork those op codes in. Hopefully with segwit coming *closer* to finality we can see this happen.


yes, see the [elements project]( It's open source, build your idea! You can peg it to testnet3 to actually experiement with the peg. We wrote a [guide]( of how to operate your own sidechain with a federated peg

You can export your keys from Armory by doing the following: 
* Select 'Backup This Wallet' 
* Select 'Export Key List' 
Now open up Electrum
* Select File &gt; New Wallet 
* Enter the private keys you took from armory into the textbox
This should import your funds into an electrum wallet. Just be careful when you are handling your private keys. Make sure you can spend your funds in your Electrum wallet BEFORE you delete your armory client if that is what you intend to do. I would recommend protecting yourself with an nlocktime transaction which guarantees you will be able to access your bitcoin at a point an time in the future. You can use [SuredBits]( to do this. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:55:18
I think you are using the word 'backup' and 'cold storage' interchangeably. They aren't necessarily the same. I would caution against a digital backup - especially if it is connected to a network. Whatever your backup is DO NOT lose it! You can mitigate the risk of losing your backup by using a service like [SuredBits](
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:23:03
I would give him/her a paper wallet. You can place instructions and stuff inside on how to redeem the coins. However to protect the parents / child against losing that paper wallet I would strongly recommend taking out an nLockTime transaction back to yourself on [SuredBits]( just to guarantee some one has access to those coins in case the paper wallet gets misplaced. 
Interestingly enough, if you want to wait till around the end of the year, you can use [CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( to guarantee those funds can't be moved until a certain point in time in the future. An example of that would be the child's 18th birthday. 
For what it is worth - I also think it would be cool to engrave the private key on something tangible. Just make sure you stress the importance of not losing this item and it can withstand water, fire etc if you aren't going to use anything else to protect the access to the coins.

According to this [blog post roughly 30% of bitcoins in existence today are more than likely lost which is roughly 4 million bitcoins](
This is a real problem and you could see even losing small amounts of Bitcoin can add up if mass adoption occurs. 
We are trying to solve this problem over at [SuredBits]( by allowing users to create nlocktime transactions to us (or themselves if they so choose). This will help mitigate some of the risk of the user losing access to their private keys or losing access to their mnemonic seeds. We also allow some one to specify a beneficiary in case something terrible was to happen.

I'm paraphrasing here, but I just recently listened to a talk from Andreas Antonopoulous (sp?) where he was talking about a proposal for 'critical nodes', nodes that which only store the set of UTXO (unspent transaction outputs), instead of storing the entire blockchain's set of transactions on your computer. 
A more theoretical answer to this question is, disk space is cheap. While average joes like you and I may not want to spend extra money to store the block chain, this money for extra disk space is a drop in the bucket for companies.

Did you use a password on your Trezor? The password acts as a pseudo-25th random seed. If you mistyped your password into your Trezor you will have a different set of bitcoin addresses generated than the addresses that would be displayed for the first password you typed in. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:30:39
I think putting multiple private keys on one piece of paper kind of defeats the purpose. Ideally you should have these keys held by multiple persons in multiple locations. Maybe I am misunderstanding your analogy, but having multiple keys on one piece of paper is more or less equivalent to having one key on one piece of paper.

This seems so contrived to me. Tip the person who is providing the best information. If you feel that person is providing value to your game experience, tip them.

There have been some phenomenal answers to this question already, but the underlying principle to why websites can be crashed, where as Bitcoin cannot be is the concept of a [Single Point of Failure]( Bitcoin is a distributed network which makes it extremely difficult to bring it down. I would imagine a coordinated attack from a highly motivated criminal ring (or government) could probably bring down the Bitcoin network right now, but if it continues to grow it becomes *much* harder to bring it down.

This is something a company such as NASDAQ will have to handle in their company policy. The colored coins are destroyed on the blockchain. You can always reissue more colored coins using the Open Asset Protocol as long as you control the original private key that issued the asset. If that initial private key is lost you cannot issue any more colored coins associated with that asset id.

That is fine, as long as the underlying satoshis used to represent the colored coin is not spent. If those satoshis are spent without retaining the asset meta information the colored coin is lost. This is why it is important to use only 'color-aware' wallets when using addresses dealing with colored coins. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:26:31
Interesting question, I think you could store 1 kb worth of data in approximately 25 bitcoin transactions. OP_RETURN allows for you to store 40 bytes worth of data in a bitcoin transaction. Each bitcoin transaction has a miner fee associated with it plus a dust amount of bitcoin used ~10,600 satoshis PER transaction. 
So we have 10,600 * 25 = 424,000 satoshis = 0.00424 BTC 
0.00424 BTC is approximately $1. 
I think this will work as long as you keep track of all of the transaction ids associated with your 25 transactions and the correct order they need to be in to restore your data. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:12:49
If you are using the [Open Asset Protocol]( only 600 satoshis + transaction fee is sent with the colored coin transaction. 
You are going to have to elaborate more on 'mixing' this can mean a couple of different things. If your satoshis are mixed in with other satoshis and do not retain the asset meta information then yes - your colored coins become uncolored.

Very nice write up by Aaron. From me playing around with elements it seems like the real show stopper is the size of CT transactions -- is there any way we can make these more efficient? From what I can recall the tx size was an order of magnitude larger than a typical transaction
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:58:03


Is this the only way CT improves fungibility?  Now that I think about it fungibility probably can't achieved until addresses are somehow masked as well since I could simply blacklist an address -- regardless of the amount residing in the address. Is there any proposals that you are aware of to some how improve on this issue?

I think this has an interesting future as well. [SuredBits]( is doing this already with nlocktime transactions.  I think it is a great way to ensure you will have access to your coins in case something happens to while remaining in control of the keys for the entirety of time period. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:54:35
[SuredBits]( allows you to create an nlocktime transaction to a family members address. If you are still around when the transaction is about to be come valid all you need to do is spend from the original address to another address you control
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:37:37
Just giving you a heads up since you seem to be replicating information for fear of losing access to your coins - you can take out an nlocktime transaction with [SuredBits]( 
It seems that you access your coins pretty frequently - but for users that do not access their coins on a regular basis this is a great tool to help protect themselves from losing access to their coins. 
Also is there a reason you don't consider a hardware wallet? If you are handling bitcoin that often it seems like it would be a worthwhile investment for you
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:50:55
This is a great question. You need to write down your passphrase or else your coins will be inaccessible. It is the last bit of entropy that you add to ensure that the RNG is not compromised on your Trezor. 


Difficult question to answer. The answer is different for everyone. If you are 100% sure that your recovery seed is stored in a safe and secure place that only your family members can access AND ONLY access it in times of need then yes. Otherwise I would say no. 


We are trying to solve this problem over at [SuredBits]( with nlocktime transactions. The premise for this is that an nlocktime transaction gives you control over your private keys at all times but can execute a transaction from a bitcoin address that you own if you haven't spent from that address in a certain period of time. Users can specify a beneficiary to contact in case their bitcoins are sent to us. We reach out to that beneficiary and figure out the best way to transfer the users funds to them. 
For example, if your Trezor hadn't moved any coins in 12 week span, this nlocktime transaction could be broadcasted to the network and have your coins redeemed. We would then reach out to your email address first - and if we could not contact you - your beneficiary's email. The benefit that this gives you is that you do not have to divulge your password to anyone - while still having protection in case something terrible happens.
If you do not have something like an nlocktime transaction and did not write down your passphrase your family will have to resort to cracking your password. Depending on how strong your password is - this might be impossible.

Here is the excerpt from bitcoin.org 


For several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures. As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2) blocks.
Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded 5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.
Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of mining income so far.
All software that assumes blocks are valid (because invalid blocks cost miners money) is at risk of showing transactions as confirmed when they really aren't. This particularly affects lightweight (SPV) wallets and software such as old versions of Bitcoin Core which have been downgraded to SPV-level security by the new BIP66 consensus rules.
The immediate fix, which is well underway as of this writing, is to get all miners off of SPV mining and back to full validation (at least temporarily). As this progresses, we will reduce our current recommendation of waiting 30 extra confirmations to a lower number.
I'll try and break it down for you


This new rule - strict DER signature enforcement - was being deployed when a certain number of miners signaled they were supporting it. This is pretty standard stuff when deploying new software for bitcoin


What this means is a miner with ~5% of the hash power got lucky and found a block. The miner propagated this block to the rest of the network to receive his 25 BTC reward. Since other miners were acting as SPV miners (not actually checking the miners work, taking their word that they actually found the correct block) other miners began mining the new block that this miner found. 


Speaks for itself I think. 


**because invalid blocks cost miners money** This is the most important thing to take away from this. The miners just made an *assumption* that the first block mined AFTER BIP66 was deployed was valid causing this issue. 
Hopefully this helps.

When bitcoin reaches mass adoption there is no way we are going to be able to trust users to reliably store these twelve mnemonic words - people can't even keep track of their social security cards. Right now bitcoin users are forced to take proactive measures to keep them from losing access to their bitcoin. When mass adoption occurs, we are going to need a way to recover users funds in a reactive manner. Right now [nLockTime transactions]( are a good way to always guarantee access to a users money. This also makes the user experience better for users just dipping their toes in the bitcoin ecosystem. We can hide the complexities of how bitcoin actually works while still giving users the benefits of controlling their coins.

For maximum privacy you should generate a new address for every bitcoin transaction you have. Are you using HD wallets from your paper wallet? If so, you can the xpub from the HD wallet and generate a new address every time you need to deposit some more bitcoin offline.
As a side note, I would highly recommend backing up your paper wallets with a [nLockTime]( transaction to guarantee you can access your bitcoin in case you lose access to the paper wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:46:32
This a great question. I've been thinking about this problem a lot. Right now the bitcoin community requires users to be *proactive* in assuring their coins protection. This does not scale for mainstream usage. Most people can barely manage their password credentials. We need to allow users coins to be able to protect their coins in a reactive manner. I founded a company [SuredBits]( to try and help with this using an nlocktime transaction to guarantee that they can access their coins in case they lose their private key. Hopefully this will encourage users to take advantage of the immense benefits of controlling your own coins while mitigating the risk of losing access to your money. The alternative is having mainstream users using Bitcoin banks - which doesn't give them any benefits

It looks like you might be SOL on this, you can always try and brute force the pin but this would not be very practical.

Just a note, [SuredBits]( allows users to create nLockTime transactions and we will support CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY as soon as it comes out. I personally think about of these features are imperative to users securing their bitcoins.

Yes, we recommend you choosing us as a safety for obvious reasons - but you could use other large wallet providers as a return address as well. 


You get warnings when you are 7 days and 24 hours away from having the transaction being valid on the bitcoin network. Your bitcoins are not at the mercy of your emails security as all that a attacker could do is attempt to broadcast the transaction - they cannot modify the digital signature to send the bitcoins else where. Your bitcoins could only be sent to the address that you specified when you took out the policy.


There isn't really an answer to this question besides bitcoin services need to monetize some how. 
 &gt;As somebody whose been into Bitcoin for a few years, listens and reads tons about this stuff, I just don't see why this is at all a good idea when your trying to be secure.
This protects you from losing passwords or having catastrophic system failures. If you could not find your recover seed - you would be able to broadcast this nlocktime transaction to the network and redeem the bitcoins that would have been inaccessible forever. 
Estimates range between 2 million and 4 million bitcoins have been lost due to mishandling private keys, passwords and recovery seeds. We are solving this problem

You will be unaffected when you "crack" open your paper wallet. What you are doing is telling your wallet client about the private key you had on the sheet of paper. If you want to transfer your bitcoin from the wallet client you import it into to another bitcoin address then you will have to go through the blockchain - which requires paying a transaction fee. 
Your private key is associated with one bitcoin address. Until you transfer your bitcoin to another address you will not have to pay transaction fees. 
In the future when you use a paper wallet I would recommend protecting yourself against losing that piece of paper using an [nLockTime transaction](

Pros:

Hey, just wanted to give you a heads up we are building a platform exactly for this. It's called [SuredBits]( We are trying to match people  looking to make a conservative ROI on their Bitcoin with people looking to protect themselves from private key loss.
The coolest thing is that we are building a system that makes it impossible for people such as yourself to lose your Bitcoin due to some one defaulting on their loan. We can prove it via the blockchain :-).

If you are planning on not spending these coins during the entirety of the 3 months I would suggest that you checkout [SuredBits]( and create a policy. 
We are a protection platform for this exact purpose - users that aren't quite confident enough in their ability to safely store bitcoin and recover it at a later date. We allow for up to 10 BTC to be listed on our platform during our beta to be protected against private key loss. The best part is, we do not control your private keys.

The fact of the matter is you are always opening yourself up to vulnerabilities when using Bitcoin. Even if there was a perfectly secure software stack, you are still susceptible for physical theft. 
You should also note that there are multiple service providers for withdrawing funds from a Trezor wallet now, one of them is [Coinprism]( which might help alleviate your concerns of having a single point of failure with withdrawing your funds from a Trezor. 
[More interesting reading on Trezors]( - I think they have upgraded the firmware to prevent this now though.

That's a personal question I guess :-). Some one like Satoshi Nakamoto wouldn't get out bed for 1,000 BTC. However if you have 1 BTC and you are living in a very 3rd world country where the average daily income is $1 a day, 1 BTC would be considered a lot. 
I think if you go through the process of properly securing your Bitcoins you won't regret it.

Hi Dskloet, 
[Chris Stewart]( here from SuredBits. The protected bitcoins are fully controlled by the policy holder. The underwritten bitcoins are held in a multi-sig address controlled by three parties. Those parties are the underwriter, the policyholder and SuredBits. 
The private key generation is done client side using Bitpay's [Bitcore]( library. The purpose of this document is to obtain public keys easily from users to create a multisig address. Those public keys on the multisig address are controlled by the private keys on the pdf. 
First we are trying to solve the problem where you lose access to bitcoins as demonstrated in [this]( article. Secondly we are investigating the viability of other types of bitcoin protection that could be offered.

This doesn't really answer your question, but if you are truly worried about losing your Bitcoins stored on your Ledger I would suggest looking at [SuredBits]( It protects you against scenarios of losing your private key and having your Bitcoins locked up in an address forever.

We are only protecting against the loss of bitcoins in the case you LOSE your private key NOT someone stealing it. This implies that the bitcoins are lost forever since it is essentially impossible to recreate them. If we see these coins move again, we have their contact information to pursue legal action against them on behalf of the underwriters. We are investigating the viability of protecting against theft, but as you have pointed out, it is a very difficult problem to detect the authenticity of theft on the blockchain :-). If you have any ideas on how to solve that problem I am all ears. 


Another great question, we do regular backups of our private keys. We are actually implementing a HD key solution where we can regenerate the private keys off of a hardware device in case of a catastrophic software failure of some sort. I would like to point out though if you are using another type of lending platform you more than likely give up ALL of the control of your bitcoins when depositing it into your account on their website where as we are empowering underwriters using multisig addresses. 
one coffee for bringing up good points

We will see how it plays out on a sidechain, do you have a link to the implementation by chance?

What would motivate me, as another user on the network to accept a payment with a covenance attached? It seems like a large hassle for me, as another us on the network to have to wait an arbitrary amount of time for ANY payment to confirm from that tx. I think the use case that Emin gave was transferring funds to yourself, which would work as you would be willing to wait for the transfer, but these type of contracts would have no place IMO to occur between two unique users on the network. 
Is there really much more benefit to integrating a new OP code to the network compared to just using cold storage properly?

We are working on solving the problem where exchange's hot wallets are exposed at [SuredBits](
TLDR: Crowdfunding insurance for bitcoin companies while issuing the underwriters (the crowd) colored coins to trade in and out of being an underwriter as they please.

There are already examples of DFS sites for Bitcoin [ExtraPoint](

EDIT: 
If you sign up and PM me your username, I'll deposit a couple of mBTC into your account to try it out. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:33:43
Yes, we will be releasing an alpha soon.

Would be cool to see something like a provably fair decentralized poker system based on bitcoin. Another interesting thing is daily fantasy sports using bitcoin like [ExtraPoint](

Seems like it is at odds with a fungible currency. I just listened to his presentation (not read the paper) but he made a reference to the fact that a certain set of users could (should) not accept payments from covenant contracts. IMO this invites classification of coins based on their convenance contract type, and (from what I understand) it also affects the irreversibility of payments. Again, just what I understood from his talk, post corrections if I am wrong.

Definitely a sign of the times that the largest automobile insurance company is researching Bitcoin. Even more interesting is that they are trying to *educate* their customer base on Bitcoin. State Farm is a very conservative company - having them even mention the word Bitcoin in a customer facing newsletter is good news I think. Hopefully the customer reaction to this newsletter is positive. 
I think it is a fair statement to say that the majority of Fortune 500 companies are researching Bitcoin to some degree - not everyone is forthright about it though.

The video is extremely cool, some real innovation happening here.

You should check out [ExtraPoint]( We allow users to control their money at all times which is unique to most DFS sites. We are trying to brainstorm ways to decentralize DFS but the problem lies in acquiring statistics. Perhaps there could be some sort of consensus mechanism for determining what the correct stats are.  I would love it if you would try out our DFS site though.

There is never *obvious* ways you might have a bug. However it is easy for little bugs to creep into your code. I used the blockchain elements generator because it is the easiest to consume, however we didn't actually find any bugs related to serializing block headers or blocks in our codebase. We did found more bugs related to ScriptSignatures/ScriptPubKeys -- particularly related to building the correct push ops for larger constants in Script. You can see those generators here:

It seems that there is a misconception that symmetric two way peg requires a hard fork change to Bitcoin. This isn't true, a OP_NOP can be re purposed to provide the functionality to verify SPV proofs from the sidechain.
