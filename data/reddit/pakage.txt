I came to that conclusion because you said exactly that.
















You continue to explain that you are seeking investors to help patch the losses, but that is not the same thing as taking a haircut on your assets along with your customers. If you're socialising the loss across your accounts while not taking a haircut yourself, that is a big problem.

Not all the coins lost were customers coins. Bitfinex is not taking a haircut along with the customers. Does this mean Bitfiniex is replacing their own lost bitcoins with customer funds?

Is there any indication as to when the rest of the 144k will be auctioned? Is it not until after the November trial?

Derp, I forgot that they're the ones converting it back to dollars, not me..
That makes more sense, so for $715 of bitcoin, i could pay $770 off my account.
My brain can't math today. I stand corrected.

I love the idea, but I am skeptical of the practicality. I live in NZ and am with this ISP. I've logged in to check it out. 
Here's the facts: 
My account balance is NZD$109 and they want me to pay it with 0.1415 BTC. This works out to value 1BTC at roughly NZD$770 which is about USD$670. Unless you're a miner or are sitting on a stack from back in the day, you may as well just pay with NZD and save yourself some cash.
Again, its a great idea, but they've over priced their exchange rate. Even our local exchange bitnz.com has active sell orders for NZD$715. NZD$770 is a joke.
edit: read below comments.. my math is round the wrong way.

I have received the same email. I am very suspicious. If it were an actual voucher it would just be in plain text, or perhaps a PDF, not 7z file! I will contact OKCoin to confirm, but i highly suspect its a scam. I would advise to NOT open the zip file for risk of installing a trojan of some description.

Also, if you look at the meta data of the email it says:
**subject:	Notification!**
**mailed-by:	server4.zmaximum.ru**
I'm 99.9999% sure OKCoin would not send mail through a Russian mail server.

Pretty sure those mining cost numbers are out by a factor of 1000... Annual mining cost is supposedly $3.5Bn

It's possible he's trying to figure out a way to make the payments. I ran a twitter campaign where I gave away 100 NAV to the first 1000 people to RT my post. Manual payments became so laborious I ended up writing a bot to scrape my twitter feed for addresses and make the payments via RPC commands. Took me a day to write but saved me days of pain as the competition ran.

Nah, direct bank transfers, cash in person or cash deposited into my bank account over the counter at the bank. Interestingly, in my country at least, the bank can actually even "charge back" cash deposited into your account over the counter which I didn't think was possible. So even after the first few frauds i never asked for ID for cash deposits. However the bank called me one day for an attempted fraud where someone sent a little old lady into the bank to deposit $1000 into my account under the pretence of her having an overdue bill she needed to pay (similar scam to what i described in my other comment). Luckily the bank teller was onto it and figured out that something weird was happening because she was depositing money saying it was to pay a bill and it was into my businesses bank account which is obviously not a utility company. The bank at this point advised me to have a 48 hour waiting period of clearing cash deposits so I only send the bitcoin after the charge back period ends. This pretty much killed 50% of the remaining 50% of my business, so i was down to about 25% of the volume i was initially doing.

And it's not just broadcasting you hold bitcoin, but by saying you don't use a bank at all combined with the fact you drive a nice car means that you've probably got a substantial stash of BTC on your phone / laptop making yourself a worthwhile target. May as well drive around with a bumper sticker saying "i have a safe filled with bullion under my bed".

So now we know that all we have to do is steal your laptop + phone and we're rich. Thanks for advertising!

I did this and was probably profiting about $500 / week for about 2 hours of work. I got hit with a couple charge backs and on the advise of my bank, i increased my security requirements on localbitcoins. After i started asking for photo identification, my sales dropped by about 50%. Even after asking for photo identification I was struck by a 3rd charge back for $2000. The hacker socially engineered the target to send their identification to them (which they then sent to me on localbitcoins) and make the payment to my bank account (claiming it was some overdue bill or fine or something). Pretty difficult scam, but there's an idiot born every minute i guess.. After the 3rd fraud incident and also depositing a lot of cash into my bank account over the counter ($30,000+), the bank shut down my accounts as a 'de-risking' measure.
Nothing ever happened past that, but it was a pain in the ass and basically all my profits got wiped out by the chargebacks.
I didn't want to go through all that drama again just to make a couple hundred bucks a week so decided to stop it. Plus this was just before the recent peak, so as that started i figured i was better off holding onto my bitcoin to profit that way.

Goods and Services Tax.
In Australia (and New Zealand where I'm from) Bitcoin isn't classified as a currency yet so technically its classed as goods. All goods sales have GST charged on top of sale price (15% in NZ) as opposed to things like stocks, precious metals and currencies which don't. 
If they don't charge GST on the sale, then it could expedite its classification as a currency which would really help a lot of fledgling bitcoin businesses which are having a hard time navigating the current tax law. In NZ if your companies revenue is over $60k per year you're required to charge GST on all goods and services which is enough to cripple bitcoin vendors who are expected to sell at market rate not 15% above!

AFAIK you don't load your Xapo card with local currency. It is linked directly to your Xapo Bitcoin wallet and the currency conversion is done on the fly. I have just ordered one of these last week!
