In that case, why not just use electronic transfers?
If a standing order was set up it would be easier for all parties involved.

Makes much more sense now, thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:49:06
And QT it is, thank you :)

Maybe if you use it so much, you should refresh the page every once in a while to help out the creator through the advert?

I have no dogecoin :(

It's cool and all but what's it doing in the British museum?
It's not exactly of historical importance just yet and as far as I know it didn't originate here (In the UK).
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:13:56
I feel that that is the downfall of the official wiki. Too much information.
Your instructions couldn't be any better!
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:36:33
Not sure I trust this. According to the PayZone website rather than this untested third-party one, there are no ZipZap payment points anywhere in the UK.

Good going! :)
@_date: 2014-01-30 11:24:15
You are a good person :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:45:06
"Peanuts" :)
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:09:49
In the US, you get charged for standing orders?
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:18:50
I have the same amount of payzones
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:10:27
I had this earlier. Logged in and sorted it out straight away though. Just resent the transaction.
Anybody know why some transactions fail though?
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:18:49
Why wouldn't you use a standing order?
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:06:30
I never said sterling was powerful, it isn't particularly. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:19:26
Why would a business ever take cheques?
If they bounce then the business has essentially given away free shit.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:03:44
How the fuck do we buy from them?
I will have it done within 30 minutes if this is true!
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:31:05
Who the fuck even pays money for a debit card in the first place?
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:38:14
All done :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:27:44
Fair enough, I'm not complaining.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:31:29
I see no mention of


on that website :/
Where did you see that?
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:10:57
Too bad I can't pay my bills (at all).
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:45:04
The Euro won't become powerful without the UK
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:01:27
I'll do it. Somebody just explain to me how to do it.
It mentions PayPoint, I have about 5 PayPoints within a 2 minute walk from my front door.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:40:11
Look at post history... troll.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:47:58
I put "please" twice in the title, I feel silly.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:08:13
All we ever get on this website is mentions of American products and services. Stop complaining when other countries get a single post.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:34:01
It could be worse even. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:50:21
But details are the enemy!
We established this ;)
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:09:09
Perfect answer, thank you!
So much simpler than the official instructions!
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:10:46
Apparently so!
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:26:58
Damn, that *is* a nice hammer!
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:48:01
Worked it out I think. I think you meant to say to use a shortcut rather than the executable.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:43:42
Actually, just a quick question.
Which field exactly am I editing?
The only text field that I have in properties of the .exe file is the file name and appending this gives errors on the use of special characters.
