Bitcoin is not so much backed by math as it is backed by humans.  The humans use math and crypto to secure the system and create a clever incentive system with checks and balances.  Bitcoin is not subject to the whims of 4 mining pools.  Pools are made up of individual miners that can choose to stay or leave depending on the pool's policy.  Anybody can also create their own pool and compete in the market, and there is no permission needed or barrier to entry.  Stop thinking that Bitcoin is a crypto/math centered technology.  Its not.  Bitcoin is a human peer-to-peer socially centered technology.  Bitcoin is just a public ledger and humans are using math and crypto technology to help secure that ledger and create the incentive system.  Hope that helps your understanding.

Well this is precisely Bitcoin's problem right now.  Too many people like you are involved who do not believe in or have confidence in Satoshi's vision.  If that is the case then leave or make an alt-coin or something.  Stop imposing your will on the community through force and censorship.  You are wrong, Bitcoin will succeed, and even the process of Bitcoin barreling through censorship and dirty tricks turns you off.  Because you have misunderstood what Bitcoin was from the very beginning.  I will be glad if the community can purge itself from the likes of you and others who have been holding Bitcoin back. (By the way thanks for the downvote, hope my comment won't be censored.)
