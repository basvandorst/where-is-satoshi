Wow, I had no idea a business like the one mentioned would have to pay $3000 per month in credit card fees! 
I can see why small businesses might turn to bitcoin/crypto currencies instead.

That makes sense, I suppose it's still a lot of money just for the "privilege" of accepting credit card payments.
Makes you wonder at how much money is required to actually run a credit card system from the bank's perspective vs running the blockchain.

Not surprised. A major bank like this will never come out and support a new alternative to the established FIAT currency system until they think it's here to stay and understand how they can profit off it too!

Interesting, I wonder what they'll define as 'normal transactions'?
