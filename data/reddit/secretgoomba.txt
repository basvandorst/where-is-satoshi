Coinbase is not a fractional banker, they hold customers funds 1:1.  If you have 1 Bitcoin in your account, they hold 1 Bitcoin.  If ether dumps to 1 cent, the only losers are people holding ether, bitcoin users are unaffected.

But bitcoin can scale to very large blocks so it does scale.  I think you mean it doesn't scale in a way that lends to decentralization and I see these as separate but connected issues.  Again I think we need a better definition for scaling to really drill into it.

A major presidential candidate is bringing exposure to blockchain tech on a platform that has never seen that before and the first two comments here are shitting on her for it.  That's amazingly stupid.
  
We are not a big enough segment of the voter base worth pandering to but obviously some people think we are.  Clinton has smart advisors and I am sure she has been told about the potential that blockchain tech can bring to government and we should be doing everything we can to encourage that dialogue and shame on any of you who work against our own interests.

I'm pretty sure you have described a problem with centralization not a problem with scaling.  I think we need a better definition of scaling in the context of this discussion to go further.

If you get your coins from an exchange you are likely going through KYC.

If the anonymization costs you anonymity, then it is not a good solution.  Any solution on top of bitcoin will stand out and expose users to their use of anonymity and that's almost as bad as not having it as an option.  It has to be baked into bitcoin so that everyone is always using it or those that are will stand out.

I strongly disagree.  When the money enables the ability to affect fungibility, then it is a problem with the money.  There are good working examples of money that is built to avoid this like Monero.  So we have real working examples of money that is fungible because it is built to be that way.

Who runs Polo?  I know who runs Coinbase.
  
Where is Polo licensed to operate in the US?  I know Coinbase is complying fully with government regulations and the government will not have an excuse to shut them down and cut off access to my funds.
  
Some very basic questions need to be answered about Polo before investors will consider the numbers you put forth.

You can convert to another currency and then back to bitcoin to get it into your BIP38 wallet while breaking the link.  I know it is not convenient and you have to rely on 3rd parties to do it, but it is an option and a very good one.  Coins like monero have anonymity built into them and you can convert your bitcoin to monero on one exchange, send it to a wallet you own and then convert it on another exchange which will completely break the link while eliminating the ability to trace the transaction from exchange to exchange.  Bitcoin will never be the magic bullet in terms of privacy so we should accept the uniquely qualified alternatives and embrace them so they can grow together.

This is great.

Regardless of what you meant, it is a problem with the money when the money is built in a way that can be used to counter fungibility.  A money that is untraceable by law enforcement lends to being fungible and monero is the best I have seen at accomplishing that.  And I don't think that level of fungibility can ever be applied directly to bitcoin due to the constraints of consensus.  So I think nullc is wasting his time and I hate to see potential wasted.  I'm not here to pump monero, I am simply using it as an example since it is the best at achieving fungibility.  If people can find a better example, I will use it.

Right, but chaining is a generic term that predates modern computing and storage.  It is not as specific as blockchaining and so it cannot infer that they came up with it first.

You should be focused on things you can accomplish, problems that are not already solved.  Monero completely solves fungability, it is **the solution** and you can never bring that level of fungability to bitcoin so don't waste your time, it is too valuable.  We have the solution to fungability so figure out how to encourage its use so that we can test its limits and eliminate them.

One of the problems I see with p2p is that you have to assume trust when it comes to the coins you receive because even an above average user cannot see what exchanges see in regards to taint analysis.  So you never know what level of trouble you might run into when you try to cash out on an exchange in the future.  By using a method that breaks the transaction relationship in an untraceable way using a reputable exchange you can assume a greater level of confidence those coins won't be questioned in the future.  Or at least this is how I feel and I do acknowledge this is driven by paranoia.

The original filing in 2008 linked there does not have the word "block" in it at all: 
  
It looks like the patent has evolved to include blockchaining technology as it has evolved.
