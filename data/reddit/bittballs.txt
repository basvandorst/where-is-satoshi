No problem, now you know the experience.  Next time you find yourself compelled to follow something that catches your desire, stick your toe in the water and see how it feels.

I don't even need to live in America anymore. America is not following the vision of the real founding fathers. I am a real founding father myself, because I believe in true freedom, I call my new country America Cash. It's what the founding fathers wanted. They wanted me to make money from morons.

Where else does this show up in your life?

The plan is to control it. Not to sabotage it immediately. If you have completed control of Bitcoin, now you simply start adding fees and increasing mining profits because you control it, and all of the sudden a few years down the road you are syphoning off billions of dollars of value. It is exactly what the banks did with interest rates, just a few increases here, a few "services" there. Smart and powerful people think long term, don't be blinded by the short term.

I happen to have a deep understanding of economics on both the micro and macro level. Go ahead and share with us how you believe that institutionalized fees slowly integrated into the economic process is sustainable.

Anything in life, including a currency only survives if it is used and supported. It is the universal law of use. If you stop using something or stop defending it you will lose it. It is naive to think that things simply happen. Bitcoin is only magical if we make it magical. You can think that it should be magical, but unless your thoughts are supported by actions, they are not translated into the 3d world we live in. You are a very important part of the world you live in, take responsibility for your actions and you will be surprised by how wonderful the world becomes. Or try hoping that everything around you is just magical and should happen on its own and see how that goes for you. Try intending to feed your dog and see how long it takes for you to realize that you have a responsibility to take action. We all have a responsibility to protect and use Bitcoin if we want it to be a part of our freedom.

Thank you Slush!

That's where you are wrong. We don't need police hired by a centralized government to tell us when people are doing wrong. We need "common sense." when you notice that people are not supporting the greater good, but instead are focused on themselves only, you can see that they should not be trusted. So do not follow, support or allow them to have any control. Crypto currency has a system setup so that we don't have to give power to people or ideas that do not represent the best way forward, and we don't have to criminalize.

Ours. Our common sense, not the individual. That's the key. WE are not vigilantes, WE are together for the common good. Only individuals are vigilantes, and if they act out we can learn, and it might be good or bad, but WE get to decide. If they are clearly bad, then realize that, it is dangerous to let vigilantes run your systems.
