Fair point, thanks! I understand that the ransom amount gets split up in the mixer but wouldn't that amount ultimately get deposited into one or a few wallets that can be used for other purposes? Is it possible to try all possible sum combinations of the resulting "cluster" wallets to see if any of them add up to the ransom amount minus the fees? This could be mitigated by using multiple tumblers multiple times but not everyone will put in the same amount of effort. I apologize if this sounds naive or if I'm grossly oversimplifying or misunderstanding something, I'm new.

Thank you for the link! :) 
Can you think of any particular reason why there aren't any? Would you use one if it existed?

I'm sorry, I really do appreciate you trying but I feel like I'm drowning in buzzword soup.
Is there a a real life example that illustrates this from end to end (i.e. who pays whom how, when, how much, and why)?

Thanks, I get the tech part. **But why?**

I have been following 21 for at least a year and I still do not understand what it is. Can someone ELI5 please?

Found an interesting post on this topic 
Maybe another angle for this type of service could be to offer a way to assess the security/anonymity of one's finances or the finances of a potential buyer/seller/partner.
