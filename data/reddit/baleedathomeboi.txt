So in this analogy that means free dongles? Sign me up!

Yea....those who want to quickly transfer funds with minimal fees ;-)
Can use any other coin except BTC for similar reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:34:32
Hmm....if only there was a variant of Bitcoin with negligible fees and quick transactions that didn't sacrifice decentralization for layer 2 networks. Wouldn't that be great?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:50:38
No. It's well past it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:38:47
You are misdirecting with irrelevant citations. Nothing in your argument states that bitcoin should not be easily and cheaply transferable which is what core is preventing it from being.

And with that, takes the gold in this year's mental gymnastics.

I've pointed you to the water if you don't want to drink that's not my problem.
The post I told you to read has all the documented sources....but feel free to shut your mind and call me more names.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:16:46
You mean the same way bitcoin project is centralized around the core devs?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:43:27
Yes of course. Saying anything else here (or worse, presenting evidence of it) will get you banned.

I'm not sure how effective logic can be in the face of blind groupthink.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:46:43
Shhh....don't believe anything else. Put your mind back to sleep now. Only nice dreams about core-approved thoughts.

See the second top post in the other sub. That's literally all you had to do. Nice job with the labels and smears though. Cheers.
