But can't buy direct on binance, have been buying on coinspot then transferring to binance or bittrex to trade.. ouch for fees

Does anyone know the best way to use AUD to buy directly on binance or bittrex.. getting raped on Aussie exchanges with terrible rates and massive fees

Too hard to get the investment amount up.. stuck at $2000 a day. Want to move more at a go

They say only invest what you can afford to lose or 10%.. I am, just interested in better than average coins or just BTC

It was an inheritance, I can afford to lose it or I wouldn't Benin crypto in the first place. Also love your handle, I had a company called NdorfN a few years back..

All of it? Can't seem to get much on the exchange at once.. how do you buy over the counter?

Currently use them but find the difference between USA price and AUD price of  BTC after exchange is still noticeable..
Want to buy over the counter with cash at a 10% market discount

Been buying a bitcoin every time it goes close to $7k.. but waiting till after the fork to see what to do.. good luck
