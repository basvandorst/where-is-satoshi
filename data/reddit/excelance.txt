Just ordered my stamp!

Are you missing the sarcasm tag?

Agreed.  We should always be talking about BTC, but to expect a company to pay in BTC today is a bit much, especially if you work in a large company.  One thing to consider, [Crypto.com]( is available in the US and the app has a checking account built in.  You could do direct deposit to that account and purchase BTC directly within the app.

How do they measure users?  Wallets, or at least addresses, do not equal users.  Ledger by default creates a new address for every deposit.

This.  This is 100% going to happen.

You probably already know this, but just in case, do not give your private key to any person.  That's all they need to get your funds and move them to their own wallet.  That said, during the BTC fork craze in 2017 and 2018, importing private keys into wallets was a common affair.  I used Exodus and Coinomi at the time and the process was super simple. 
Most BTC wallets will let you import a private key.  [Here]( is a good site that has basic instructions on how to import the private key.

Yes, some alts are scams, some are just poorly run, and some are really good.  However... most are at least succeeding/failing based on their own works, whereas BCH is really trading on Bitcoin's name and reputation.  Does anyone think BCH would be around when they forked and didn't carry the Bitcoin name with them?

92.24.... no wait, 93.45.... oh wow, it's a steal at 90.92.

Just did two bank transfers.  [Crypto.com]( settled the **very** next day... Coinbase is going on 4-days now.  I highly recommend it.

Fair points... but consider that in the next 10-years it's very likely physical cash will either disappear or outright banned as governments want more monitoring of transactions.  When that happens, your lemonade stand example is the same.

I really try to stay neutral on these things... I really do want the best tech to win out.  But this is just crazy.  I can't wait for BCH to find itself in the dustbin of history.  I'm fairly knowledgeable about crypto but I was so confused when I joined r/BTC and all I saw was FUD threads of Bitcoin and hype for BCH.  They really have no class.

I love this meme, even after the 10th time it's been posted here.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:50:06
I don't get it?

Checking your prior posts, you seem to be selling these.  You're not going to get much traction here with the negative BTC comment.  One, most people here are long-term bullish on BTC.  Two, if you purchased BTC at any point other than a few weeks in its 10+ years, you'd be in profit.  This year alone BTC is up almost 100% so the comment doesn't make sense.
Change it to a positive BTC comment and you might get more interest.

You sound like a very pleasant person.  Have a great day, and I'll go back to stamping Bitcoin onto my bills.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:50:21
I'm one of those sad losers.  I bought a stamp and stamp the bills that I get.  It's fun... why do you care?  Do you also look down on people who put bumper stickers on their car?

And how is my Bitcoin stamp any different than someone going on Reddit and criticizing someone's hobby?
