Perhaps in America. Elsewhere the burden of proof is on whoever they say it’s on.

Does this not happen on a rolling basis?

As of 1/1/18 any exchange of crypto (for either USD or other crypto) is a realization event triggering the need to recognize either gain or loss on the transaction. Prior to that date, crypto to crypto exchanges were not realization events, only an exchange to USD (including “USD wallet” on coinbase).

Being an accredited investor doesn’t make u a 1%er

No actually the threshold for accredited investor is much lower than for being considered among the 1%. See for example

Bc this is not a conversation abt inequality. It is a conversation about the definition of accredited investor and you incorrectly stated that you need to be in the 1% to be an accredited investor. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:30:53
The bottom line is that it is incorrect to say that you need to be among the 1% to be an accredited investor. Actually, a based on a quick google search it seems that 8.25% of US households qualify as accredited investors. Compare that to only...well...1% that qualify as the 1%. I wouldn’t call a &gt;8x difference nitpicking.

The difference is actually quite significant. The number you quoted is 2013 household income based on national average. As the article mentions it is exponentially larger along the east coast for example, not to mention in 2018.
