The general ledger is really just a bunch of text that won't ever get as big as something like a high resolution image host or a video host. I don't think it's something to really worry about. Also if this does become a problem there are some solutions

Good to see people may be taking action over this 51% attack. Maybe Ghash will finally get some motivation to stay below 50% if they know someone will DDoS the shit out of them if they do. (hope the DDoS is real.. and if not that Ghash took it upon themselves to decease the hash rate)

If you are worried about 51% attack... we are in the testing phases of bitcoin. it's time to let things happen and test shit out... otherwise people will keep freaking out about it and preventing potential investors and users to join. I am not for centralization but I don't think this is as bad as a lot of the bitcoin community believes

It's always a good idea to keep any savings onto a true cold storage system (best when in your control). If you are a trader then just keep what you need for trading on the exchange and everything else should be transferred to a cold or paper wallet. Even if your exchange keeps 95% of their coins in cold storage you will run the risk of internal theft or mismanagement.

This really is all due to greed. If Ghash wants to conquer they should just break their pool up. We need an "anti-monopoly" function within the network... Not sure how or if its possible though

Awesome! I went there and pretended for a moment I was in a store front. I felt for a second, what it WILL be like when all grocery stores have BTC price tags in big bold numbers right above a smaller, non-bold USD price.

Armory is the best client I have used. Has functions no other wallet has and the new multi sig functions are the evolution of wallet security. Many places say this client is for advanced users and multibit is for the novice user... But I disagree. There are several modes you can set which will vary the degree of complexity within the user interface .. but even the advanced mode shouldn't stump the novice bitcoin user. I have had tons of issues with multibit and wallets like it and I can tell you with confidence armorys the best. Helps you create paper wallets, sweep addresses... And now with the new multi sig feature, armory will continue to cement itself as the most feature rich and secure bitcoin wallet.

Of course it would. Look at how easy it is to set up a digital currency? Literally anyone can do it. If someone removes what makes bitcoin great then we will end up creating a new gold standard.

I'm hoping the auction gets plenty of publicity and lots of buyers participate which drives up the price so it doesn't have such a huge effect on the market. (in a perfect world)

I believe Armory is open source.

This would simply kill bitcoin. A new, or currently existing coin and blockchain will take its place. The whole point behind bitcoin is taking control from the government and decentralizing. The government's idea of "regulation" is controlling everything. Bitcoin would become a used piece of toilet paper if every transaction has to be registered with the government. Not even regular bank transactions are registered with the government.

I mainly cover crypto news on a diff. Site. Sorry. Touch screens a bitch. But where do you stand in this?
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:01:24
The time Coinbase goes public our standard currency will be bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:17:38
Now are by the content where you stand. I didn't notice it was down voted. I've mainly cover normal cryptocurrency news.

What requirements is Connecticut seeking???

I was mainly referring to how Bitcoin is going to take over and be the default currency of the world :] So when you go into your local grocery store you see a big BTC price and a smaller USD price. -- But since you brought it up, you should try to integrate a currency switcher like blockchain.info has. So that the price is actually a button which you can click and instantly change to USD. Better yet, changing from BTC, to LTC, to USD, to EURO, etc.

"At Consensus 2015, we'll discuss the role of a decentralized public ledger in global aid and disaster relief scenarios with the individuals and organizations who are spearheading that debate. We'll examine the future of global finance with luminaries from the world's largest institutions. We'll talk about how decentralized protocols can form a new layer in today's technology stack, with lessons from the "darknet" markets." READ MORE @ Coindesk.com (edited to have a more American spelling).
I really wish I could make it, but it's across the country from me (if it actually takes place). There will be too many disagreements get anywhere in a forum ran by geeks.
If you ever dealt with mining hardware company's you'll understand how bad the customer service of geeks are. IT IS horrendous. This isn't just a one off it's pretty much straight across the board. True hardware and/or software engineers are truly the worst at customer service... Yet they run the IT departments. No wonder I never use IT (taking me in circles of what I did before).
What do you guys think will happen at this so called "consensus or 2015"?
