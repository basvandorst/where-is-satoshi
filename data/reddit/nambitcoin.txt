Hi All, I am new to Bitcoin and try to understand the value of the network and the currency unit. This is a wonderful writing from Erik and I would like to add something to demonstrate the value one may see it from the other side of the big pond :D
Everyone sees Chinese traders are going nut with BitCoins regardless of what Peter Schiff or the gold traders think about it. Why? In China and a few other places, one cannot trade gold easily or exactly cannot move the currency just with the mouse click. How do you pay for a house in California while being in Beijing? Banks will not help much unless the Chinese Government gives you the permit to wire the money, in this case never. BitCoins bought from BTCChina can be transferred and converted into US$ and paid without any interference from anyone. So even if Peter Schiff and others continue to ignore BitCoins, Chinese, Japanese investors would put their Yuan and Yen into Bitcoins to buy properties in the West, unless someone put a stop to its trade. I do not see Chinese or Japanese Government do that because they cannot control the underground economy,  I am not saying people buying drugs or trading arms, Chinese people always keep cash and make or receive cash payments while importing/exporting goods to the outside world. Bitcoins will help them doing it much easier without fearing the government clampdown.
So while Peter Schiff sees it as zero value, all the BitCoins will be helpful to people he may never understand, and they just ignore him for a good reason.
That is my two cent, no offense to anyone. Cheers! NBC
