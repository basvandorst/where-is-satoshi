I had my mail server also blacklisted. It's on a Linode VPS. The reason for blacklisting was that someone on the same IP subnet was sending spam. So they blacklist a bunch of IP addresses, even though only one of the addresses is spammy. There is a mx blacklist check tool that tells which lists you are on, and then you have to contact the list manager to get your IP unlisted.

WATSON is an artificial intelligence computer running on general purpose CPU:s which don't have a chance against ASIC chips. ASICs are designed to only hash, so they are way more efficient at that.

Bandcamp has the greatest potential for adopting bitcoin. They could make it work so that the artists/labels receive bitcoin if they want - not convert straight to fiat like most businesses that accept bitcoin. The only problem would be with physical products: if you buy a record and don't receive it (which has happened to me) there would be no way to get your bitcoin back.

No, they require only your money and a bitcoin address. In Finland bitcoin is a commodity, which is not regulated in any way so you can buy and sell it anonymously. Even an officer of the finnish central bank is quoted in the article confirming that.

The hardware specs are similar to the first 2 generations of iPhone/iPod touch which can scan QR and run wallet apps just fine. But it seems that the Firefox OS is not running as efficient in that low of a hardware spec. The first iPhones wouldn't even today have that much trouble loading the Ars home page as that phone in the article has. There is a HTML5 implementation of QR scanner but it's quite picky about the orientation.

How would you do it with $20 million, in practice? The only way I could think is to buy outside of exchanges - with a premium - and then dump into exchanges to lower the price. But how would you find a miner who will continuously sell such a big amount to you?

Why would the graph be crashing down? Of course the chart will display the value as XBT (100 satoshis) for all the historical data also. Just like doing stock splits doesn't cause the stock graphs to jump suddenly, they adjust the historical data to match.

A better example would be to use the excess heat produced by ASICs in a toaster or water boiler. That would require chips packed tight and running really hot, which is a challenge. Also it shouldn't cost much more than a conventional appliance because it's still not going to generate much bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:01:15
But heat pumps are 200-400% efficient, depending on conditions. It sounds crazy but it's true.

I have seen many ideas of using the blockchain to verify contracts or do authentication, and often they mention that you would need to send only one satoshi to be included in the blockchain. But it seems like this is not the case and won't be even if the block size limit is raised. So a fee of over a dollar is needed in order to do any kind of contracts? Doesn't that defeat the idea of for example 21, inc.? (Edit: a fee of .0005 seems to be enough for now, so it's something like 10 cents)
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:51:27
It's way harder to transmit cash anonymously than bitcoin, as you need to pick it up from a physical location. You know that.

If I got it right, he is suspicious about why would you offer this kind of service for free. Let's assume your service becomes hugely popular, you will need resources to keep it running smoothly. What is your business model? Ads on the site only go so far, maybe you are some day selling your users' emails and phone numbers too? Maybe you should take a fee of 1 mBTC right from the start to keep everybody happy :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 00:30:49
It seems to be using Blockchain.info's API to check the balance - I'm wondering what they think of potentially thousands of users querying their servers at this rate? EDIT: I got "aborted" after about 1000 requests.

There was an article on the biggest newspaper in Finland today about a mining farm located here in a closed down steel factory. It is run by Bitfury which is a company that creates their own ASIC chips. And in the end of the article they said that the farm has recently shut down and workers are packing the mining gear for transporting away. Source:

That may be a statistical glitch - it's a country with much less search traffic than western countries so a small peak in bitcoin search activity might show up like that. Just guessing tho.

The "current price" in an exchange is the price of the latest transaction. If nobody sells any bitcoin, there won't be any transactions even though there could be people willing to buy at any price. So the price in the charts would stay at the last actual transaction. Of course somebody would always sell at some price, but the hypothesis was if NOBODY sold.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:33:06
Currently BCH blocks are mined about 30 minutes apart. Of course, Bitfury taking part in mining could speed that up significantly.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:23:41
If nobody sold, the price would stay the same.

That means the ransomware authors only need to generate new private keys and deploy their software again based on those keys. Of course this key generator will help many people at this moment, but not in the future.

This translation still fails on the unit of the energy tax - it's not cents but "öre" which is 1/100 of Swedish krone (SEK). Divide that by 10 and you get approximate USD cents.
@_date: 2016-05-27 21:52:56
Yeah but they are only talking about the tax. At the moment, 1 kWh in Sweden costs 0,02 € but it will be more in the winter. On top of that is the tax of about 0,02 € / kWh and they need also to pay the grid company for transfer, but that can be negotiated. So I'm guessing their final price will vary between 0,05 and 0,10 € / kWh (Edit: substitute € with $ and we are still in the same ballpark)
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:02:16
Not possible as far as I understand. Because the private key and the public keys are related so that the public address is derived from the private key. Currently it takes lots of processing power to create vanity addresses even with one word in the beginning.

Here in Finland it's totally possible to have a hourly rate based on the market price, also for consumers. The power company just adds their margin (like 0,0029 €/kWh). Most homes have a digital meter which reports usage by the hour.
