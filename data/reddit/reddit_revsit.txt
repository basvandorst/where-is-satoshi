Yes, I speak with them often as to many others, they have a private SLACK channel as well you can sign up to.  They are not hiding behind anything.  They will soon be approved/licensed AG company in Switz.   If you wish to speak with lead dev msg him here:   
(They run this coin as well, in addition to 1ex.trade).
Anyways, think what you like but I urge you to please check out the site in a month or two and reassess.  Cheers.

The dev of Wild Beast Block (creator of 1ex.trade and wbbos.com has a new v5 HYBRID-wallet coming out soon (within the next 30-60 days) that will pretty much change the way we look at crypto-currency :) - Give it a whirl when it's ready and see for yourselves.
"WBB does not require the blockchain to be loaded on a local CPU. This change means WBB has moved into a regulatory system, providing instant synchronization when the WBB wallet is opened. That way the user no longer needs to have gigabytes of free storage to host the WBB blockchain, as is standard with other coin wallets. WBB transaction speed is unmatched with a TPS (transaction per second) rate of over 10000 WBB. When compared to other coins such as BTC (with about 4-7 TPS), it's over a thousand times faster. The WBB V5.0 wallet solves the critical issues of blockchain bloat, double spend, take-over risk, long synchronization times, payment delays, and of course the need to store the full blockchain."

Your reply makes my brain hurt as you sound like a typical uninformed trading kid.  It's a new exchange that will blow away most of the current crap out there (ie. bitfenix amateur hour) but they will need to begin MARKETING to get more btc volume, though they do have banks/businesses already lined up to start using it. ;) :) - You think it's easy to get something like this off the ground?  I speak to the dev often (they are Swiss based) and yes they are legit, solid team of devs and will have good support.  V1 was almost more of a test site to get a feel for the ins/outs of the market but moreso to see how it'd run for the dev team working out bugs behind the scene.  V2 will be "the" site.  In 2017 they'll go full decentralized integrating with  - anyways, check it out say in a month from now and try it out.  If you don't like it don't use it, but from beta tests thus far people seemed quite pleased.  Site is super fast and will have better security than 99% of the other exchanges currently in the market.

I speak to the dev often and it'll be one of the most secure sites.  It's legit so nothing to worry about from what i've seen, you'll see in due time.  Ironic you say "not very trustworthy" for a new exchanges (still setting up) yet look at the current sites LMAO.  garbage security.   The current one up was bare bones and the new v2 launch will be soon (most likely a few days to a week more).  They are based in Switzerland and are bank-experienced as well as in crypto and trading.  They are not mickey mouse like so many current sites.  Anyway, I suggest not writing them off so soon. :) But up to you.  Just check in on the site in say a month from now and re-asses.  They will have some banks lined up and a few biz's as well to get some BTC flowing.   will be intergrated next year for a fully decentraziled site.

Screw them.  1ex.trade v2 is launching in a few days and their security (and speed) will be LIGHT YEARS beyond most crap exchanges currently on the market.  The volume will pickup there I'm sure.  2017 they will be decentralized, probably one of the first to do so.

email them and ask, I don't work for them so I can't answer most of those questions.  It's available worldwide so yes, any country can trade via their site.  Margin I believe you need licensing for that, no idea if they will apply or not.  They have BTC/LTC and a bunch of alt coins along with many FIAT trading pairs.  Thanks.

Give 1ex.trade a try, they are newer but look promising.  Hopefully volume picks up for 2017 (it should) since they have actual contracts in place with big insurance businesses to start utilizing coins on there.  There are no BS bots going nuts either like on poloniex or bittrex and their security is WAY better, not to mention the site is blazing quick.
