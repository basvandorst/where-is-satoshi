Bitcoin isn't ever going to be a currency, it doesn't behave like one in any way, and technically - it's real bad for transactions. More likely an alt-coin will end up being an actual usable currency. Bitcoin is more like a commodity.
Honestly, if you're really about disrupting fiat currency, you should probably back one of the alt-coins that's actually developing toward a usable currency.

Thank you for not replying in a snarky and aggressive attitude.
In regards to cartels, I agree that prohibition fosters them. However, I also feel that without a body that monopolizes force, all companies would need to employ some kind of para military body in order to protect themselves. Many corporations today operate in an aggressive and forceful manner, even if not with direct physical violence. What about cigarette companies falsifying research, or industry externalizing pollution. How would one force them to pay the "true cost" of their activity without externalizing it? I would argue that almost no American corporation pays the true cost of their activities, and that you and I only wear the clothes we do because we externalizer the cost of their manufacture on overseas workers. 
Before regulation, industry was considerably more violent. We had things like the pinker tons. We had things like garment factories locking workers inside. And even if we were to say "well the workers can organize", the problem is that when capital is consolidated, it's very easy to apply economic violence and squeeze people into needing to endure such conditions in order to afford food and shelter.
I do not believe that companies would benevolently shoulder the burden of their activities, but rather that they would externalizer even harder if they were t regulated, and that without another party strong enough to regulate them, we as general folk would be unable to do much about it. I mean, you or I really have no idea what most mega corporations are up to, and though I don't believe the government does a perfect, or even good job of regulating them, without governmental regulations we would have an even more difficult time avoiding a drift toward corporations acting like states simply because their excessive capital would provide them the agency to do so.
Essentially I feel that capitalisms natural state for entities is to trend toward infinite growth and acquisition, and that without a third party, the googles and wal marts of the world would be able to easily apply even greater economic pressure and begin forcing people into the corporations own agenda. 
Now, I'm not a statist, or real fan of the state, but I just do not see how capitalism leads to anything other than oligarchy.

@_date: 2015-05-18 14:15:46
First, please stop downvoting because you disagree. We're having a discussion and it's fine to disagree. Downvotes are for off topic of abusive posts.
I'll give you an example of a non-governmental market force that fucks poor people.
Credit Cards.
So if you're smart, and have good credit, and are able to get a good card, that's great. They come with sick perks like airline miles, or cashback or something. So it's great to use them, pay of the balance, and take the perks. However, the CC companies gotta make money to cover this. One way they do is through people who get stuck in an interest cycle, but that's not what i'm pointing at. See, credit card companies charge a fee to merchants in order to use the card. That's why you often see minimum purchase requirements for using a card. Well, prices have gone up subtly because of that credit card transaction fee. Those of us with good credit and capital don't care because we offset that view the perks. However, if you're unable to attain a credit card, you end up eating that cost increase. So credit cards actually end up externalizing perk cost to those who are unable (or I suppose unwilling) to use a credit card.
Capitalism is inherently sociopathic. I mean think about a capitalist society that ACTUALLY didn't have any government regulation. Well, we have that, they're called drug cartels. If there isn't a third party that monopolizes force, you end up with the companies ('cartels' in this example) enacting their own form of force, and it becomes a huge problem. So what we do is we start to regulate capitalism, and we say things like "ok well you can't run a business that kills people" (even though in pure capitalism that would indeed be ok), and "you can only pollute X amount" (even though in real capitalism you could pollute as much as you want).
This brings us into a discussion of externalities as a whole. As a business, it's in your best interest to externalize as many costs as you can. For example, a Wal-Mart (to use the business you brought up) moving into a city actually ends up costing the residents a shit load of money, because Wal-Mart is smart enough to externalize a lot of the cost of their employees onto local services. This is a small example, but runaway capitalism will always result in organizations trying to externalize as much as they can. The only way to stop this is to regulate with a government. At that point it just devolves into a discussion of how much to regulate, with folks on the rich side lobbying for less regulation (so they can further externalize) and those on the poor side arguing for more regulation (in order to prohibit the externalization.)
Now, I understand the initial allure of capitalism (and I used to be way for it), because it SOUNDS meritocratic. But it's really about as far from meritocracy as feudalism.
Take this example. Two men start out completely equal, we'll call them John and Bob. John works hard, starts a business, and makes lots of dollars. Bob sucks and lazes around and ends up poor. Ok, this sounds fine, it's bob's own fault. But now they both have kids. John Jr. starts out with a significant advantage over Bob Jr. Run this example over tens of generations, and you end up with what basically amounts to a hereditary oligarchy, and any notion of meritocracy is pretty much blown out of the water. We try and correct this with things like government scholarships and such, but again, those are in direct opposition to a capitalist philosophy.
As such, pure capitalism looks like a pretty horrible world. It results in hereditary oligarchy, as well as richer folk working to externalize their costs on others, which honestly isn't much different than a stronger man beating up on a weaker man.

Wat? Our government also operates in a capitalist fashion. The nature of capitalism is such that having less capital (being poor) means you have less agency. This is a feature that cannot be separated from capitalism and means that the poor will always have a harder time than the rich when it comes to nearly any situation. The only way to mitigate this is to enact a social safety net. But once you do that you begin creating policies that are not really capitalistic.
I don't understand your aggression here.

3) I tackle that self directed project, then show the team I've done it and what I learned. Now that falls into my responsibilities and I repeat from

That's because the vast majority of bitcoin folks these days are just trying to get rich by speculating bitcoin. They do not care if it works as a currency.

If you made money in bitcoin, you were not smart. You were lucky.

Do you actually have any idea how a blockchain works? Or what it even is? There are a shitload of legitimate usecases for blockchain outside of currency, with no token based incentive to mine, and there are loads of companies rushing after them right now.
Look at hyperledger - it's essentially a blockchain framework totally not based on a currency that can be permissioned and locked down privately.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:19:27
A business might use it internally and happily run miners to confirm their own transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:01:40
No, I understand the difference. The issue is just that my examples aren’t great applications. I don’t know the best use-case for block chain, I’m just reasonably certain that several use-cases exist outside of currency, and that we’ll see some innovative uses that aren’t crypto currencies in the near future.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:07:09
Just because the data exists, doesn’t mean you need to give literally everyone permissions to it.

You do not need currency to make blockchain work. Nothing about blockchain requires a currency.
Here is a medium article explaining this [
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:45:31
Git isn’t the same at all. Git doesn’t ensure that we all have the same data. It allows us to diff changes and resolve conflicts and such, but you can pull a git repo and then fuck up the data into an irreconcilable mess all you want. That is nothing at all like the advantages of using a blockchain. Git also still requires a central repository if you want to coordinate.
My basic position is simply that there exist practical applications for blockchain outside of currency. I don’t understand why so many folks seem so against that.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:41:09
Yes, sort of. Blockchain can be understood as a sort of database.
However, it is not anywhere near something like a traditional relational database. It does not function the same way.
Note: just because I'm saying "there are use cases for block chain outside of currency" - I am not saying that everyone should stop using tried and true RDBS for their junk - just that we're going to see some innovative applications of blockchain outside of the currency sector.
Check out hyperledger.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:34:07
I'm not talking about bitcoin, I'm talking about blockchain.
Bitcoin is a single, specific implementation of blockchain.
If you want to build a private blockchain for some specific and limited business scope - you do not need 160k nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:29:33
That is just not true. Blockchain does solve open permissionless participation, but that’s not all it does.
Furthermore, a business creating a private blockchain is not “just a Merkle tree” blockchains generally use Merkle Trees in individual nodes, however the overall structure of a blockchain is quite different from a Merkle tree.
A private blockchain is not in any way an oxymoron and I have no idea why you’d think that.
Just because a system is distributed doesn’t mean it must be infinitely and freely distributed. A company could for sure just run its own nodes. It could grant another company access to only part of the data in exchange for running a node. Etc etc. 
A private blockchain is completely possible, people have already done it, google “private blockchain”. Many companies are heavily investing and betting on this kind of tech and building shit with it in all sorts of sectors.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:36:15

You're thinking of common and clandestine CRUD style stuff, which, yes of course you shouldn't convert your basic CRUD app running on mysql to run on blockchain.
What this could revolutionize are things like, how you share your medical data with the various medical vendors you interact with, or how legal documents get passed around.
There are totally legit use-cases for blockchain outside of currency. Loads of companies are rushing after them already.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:42:08
There you go - it's a legitimate, already in use application of blockchain completely outside of currency.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:43:45
What? I'm giving you legitimate examples of practical applications outside of currency that can be locked down to a private group. These already exist.
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:59:32
I think you’re right and medical data in that way probably isn’t the best example. I’m not sure what the optimal application of blockchain is - but my basic position is that there are use-cases outside of currency, and we will for sure be seeing some applications of blockchain in the near future.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:51:30
Because blockchain is distributed, and incorruptible and provides assurance that you can trace logs of transactions all the way to genesis.
Think about that for data heavy applications like medical data.
You don’t need to open it up to the world, you can run all the nodes internally and run them yourself if you want. It’s completely possible to run a wholly private blockchain that way and it has advantages and disadvantages against a classic relational db.
Bitcoin is merely a single and very specific application of blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:21:00
That is not true. A company could happily utilize a blockchain internally without mining currency or “value tokens” as some like to say.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:23:56
No, it would just be different - probably not a currency. Blockchain is great tech and it has a fuckton off applications outside making a crypto currency
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:27:26
I think you're right - and I don't profess to have the exact best use-case for blockchain.
What I meant by "private blockchain" is really more akin to what you mean as a semi-private blockchain. I really just mean "not public".
What the best use-case is, I'm not sure, but I do think there will be many uses outside of just crypto-currency.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:55:27
Bittorrent would be abyssmal for that.
The advantage of a blockchain is that you confirm the transactions by consensus, and that you have a record of every transaction back to genesis. You cannot lose data that has been confirmed and added to the chain. For something like medical data (ostensibly sensitive data) a blockchain is going to provide you just considerably more control over who can see what data. Things like permissions changes are confirmed by peers, written to the chain, and can be traced back. That's the advantage.
You can do this kind of stuff with a traditional RDB (and obviously they do now), but that ends up creating a bunch of disparate systems all over the place. Right now you have no central medical data on yourself - just every hospital, doctor, dentist and what not you hit up has their own data on you, sometimes they share it, but probably not in the same format, and it's probably patched together with some shitty vendor's system.
A legit blockchain implementation could actually centralize something like that and control how it's passed around. Even within a single hospital it could unite a number of their systems and avoid some bad data problems that happen in disparate traditional systems.
Bittorent is a file transfer protocol.
Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger (it doesn't need to be public). Very different stuff. You can absolutely permission data in a blockchain. You can absolutely run a private blockchain.
Take a look at hyperledger. This already exists.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:18:22
That is not true. I mean blockchain IS a sort of database - just one where it’s not possible to change the log of transactions that have already occurred - and one that doesn’t rely on a central store.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:48:28
That’s completely untrue. The incentive exists to get random folk to use processing power to confirm transactions.
A business can just do that. There’s also strong upsides to a db schema that preserves a log of every transaction back to genesis. Think about that in medical data or some such.
In fact the “incentive” has nothing to do with blockchain and everything to do with bitcoins specific implementation of blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:43:28

@_date: 2011-06-13 19:46:57


This is a bit of a misunderstanding.  It's not the more users, it's the more spread out the currency is.  If there are two users, and user A has 90% of the moneys, then user A has just as much power as if there are a hundred users and user A has 90% of the money.
More users doesn't fix anything unless the currency gets distributed.  The Mt.Gox or other large powers that rise will still be able to control the economy if they have sufficient capital.  That's how capitalism works and bitcoin does nothing to mitigate that.  All it does is remove a state from the equation, not necessarily large, powerful organizations.

So you say that cooperating beats selfishness, well, that's an incredibly narrow definition.  What if a few humans work together to beat others, is that really cooperative?  Even within that group, there are power struggles going on.  And even with that group, the group is being selfish as compared to the whole.  That isn't actual human cooperation, that's simply one group versus another.  When I say "selfish" I don't simply mean only single people out on their own.  I mean that we as humans do not cooperate as a whole, we do not stop and say "What is the best course of action for society".  Capitalism deincentivizes altruistic behavior.  In order to take an altruistic action, one must take personal loss.  Capitalism incentivizes selfish behavior.

If it isn't stable, it won't ever be viable to be used in day to day transactions, you know, like a currency.

This is a stable currency that I feel comfortable using in my day to day transaction.

The first sentence was sarcastic. Which is what spawned this entire comment thread.

This is all I was saying. I don't feel comfortable (nor do most) using a currency that swings this wildly.  This would be like a good costing $10 one day and then $14 the next. It basically means that unless you're simply using bitcoin as a glorified payment system, it's not stable enough to use. You can't make daily transactions without constantly monitoring the value of the currency.

You are just ridiculously aggressive.  I made an initial snarky comment about the nature of bitcoin, and you have yet to refute, or really even interact with that comment.
There's all this rhetoric about bitcoin being some amazing free currency, but it's not. It doesn't function as a useful currency to the common consumer because its value fluctuates so wildly.  That's it. That's my point. That's what my post was about. So go ahead and drop all you're douchey, aggressive digs, and interact with the actual content of my comment please.
All your absurd, and overly aggressive knocks about me being bitter for not having made money are completely irrelevant. I don't care to make lots of money off bitcoin. I'm not interested in that.
