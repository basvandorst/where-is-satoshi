He bought at like 2 or 3k so even if this shit goes to 4k he's probably still up 100k+.
If you watch the video they say they are prepared to lose everything because they want to live a simple lifestyle anyways. And to be honest, There is something to be said for raising a family in a simplistic outdoor lifestyle than a standard western lifestyle where they will end up with terrible back and wrist problems from instagram or gaming addictions.

Hey guys, I feel bad for some of you new guys that bought high. When i first got into crypto, I bought bitcoin when it was coming down during the China FUD. I sold at a 10% loss a day later, then bought back a day after that.. Ended up reducing my BTC amount decently. Over the last few months ive learned my lesson. Sold BTC way too early at 6200.. Big mistake.. I ended up buying Bitcoin Cash a few days ago, and am still invested in that at present. No one fucking knows whats going to happen in crypto, but I'm sure bitcoin is here too stay, although I believe bitcoin cash will be here to stay as well, serving different use cases.
The point is, yes, it may go down, quite a bit even. I wouldn't be surprised to see 4k. If it reaches that level, I assure you, I will be selling my BCH and buying back into BTC.... Aka, everyone knows bitcoin is valuable in the long run.
But take the lesson from me, don't sell bitcoin. And if you do, do it after a short stop-loss, not after watching it dwindle down over the days. Im sure if you hold it for 3 years it will be worth way more, and if you aren't willing to hold it that long, you are in the wrong game, should sell, and invest in NVDA or something..
Good Luck guys

To put it in perspective, there are people who bought 100+k worth at the all time high.
