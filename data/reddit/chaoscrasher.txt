Well in my opinion it could very well be that the value of bitcoin does rise the more other people have bitcoin, since this puts pressure on merchants to adopt bitcoin as does the perspective that their payment is going to increase in value.
Also scaling solutions seem to be coming along.

HODL. jk. It could be that more people understand what bitcoin is thereby driving increased demand.

Still. How long is it going to take to get a 100% return with modest means? Or rather how long would it have to take to still have any seasoned investor jump straight for that apr?

To get him to try it out and familiarise himself with bc. I would have chosen a low fee since confirmation time doesn't matter to me with friends.
(quite ironic that bitcoin right now is most usable with trusted third parties, but hey the scaling solutions will come)

I agree that the question of access in it's essence is divorced from regulation; you can still allow people to have true access to their currency AND have regulation.
However, your underwear comparison just makes no sense, unless you think anarchy is a good method of government. An underwear cannot be used to incentivize hostile actions, a medium of exchange can.
By your same logic we also shouldn't seize weapons of commited murderes since 'why not also confiscate their underwear, because it was also used in that illegal action?'. It's about **how and to what cause** something was used in relation to democratically created laws to determine whether it is necessary to be seized, and you know it.
I know this is a big question, but please explain how anarchy can ever provide better enforcement than even the shittiest democracy? The same powers that corrupt our laws aren't suddenly removed in total anarchy, are they? And to answer your earlier question: We seize the money our government is spending to buy bombs, by electing representatives, which is effectively undermined by the **absence** of election financing regulations. **No laws is not the next logical step to the absence of good laws**.
By making the anarchy argument you **do** heavily undermine mainstream adoption since the last thing ordinary people want to associate with is something that is considered lawless.
