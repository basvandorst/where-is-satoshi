my stuff do not belong to you, you sociopathic fuckwit. You might as well claim all pretty girls belong to society too. Fuck your mentality.

To anyone who never questions the morality of statist laws and follows them as holy bible, I have only one example. Imagine the state come up with an idea to exterminate all black people and homosexuals. Would you follow the law? And before you jump into this "oh the state would never do this" bullshit, look at the hitory. Yeah, most statist laws are immoral and violent in nature.

It's kinda strawman of ancap position, you know that. You have to understand why ancaps believe what they believe in order to see the difference between caricature and truth. For instance, breaking laws in ancap eyes is moral thing to do, if the law itself is unjust and immoral.
But again, you believe one thing, ancaps the other and there's nothing you can do about it to convice even single one of them. It's a principle matter, not pure pragmatism. But even then they'd like to see proof how pragmatism leads to happiness etc... so it's never ending loop.

value is in the mind of the humans. I don't believe in inherent value. Yes. I like gold standard and I am a proponent of it but that doesn't mean I don't think other currecny can't replace it.

I had same questions and I realized that all money are always in a bubble. Just because gold is physical it doesn't mean it has value outside my imagination. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:01:33
yes, but I doubt any currency nowdays have a fixed exchange rate. They always fluctuate which prove my point that they are always in a bubble, just some are more "stable" than others.

it is just a matter of pricniple and perspective. Ancaps believe that you can not change a system working withing the system, it would be like trying to bring yourself out of the pool of water by holding your own hair (aka Münchhausen paradox). Also, as principle, ancaps believe it is immoral to use the corrupt system either for good or bad, because it uses agressive coercion and extortion racket - taxes. 
A pacifist doing nothing when he doesn't help someone being beaten isn't bad or immoral. He does not initiate coercion on anyone. Maybe he has reason to not interupt etc. Doesn't matter. However, he would be called by most ancaps, I'd like to believe, asocial and an idiot.
