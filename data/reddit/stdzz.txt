Ooookay, where to begin...
So, it's been years since I put myself into the BTC world, my last purchases were for blackmarket reasons (if only I'd held onto them, right?).  Anyways, I've got a wallet that has .05 BTC right now, back from 2014.  I know there was a split or w/e it was being called (sorry, haven't followed this for some time) so does that mean that these .05 BTC that I have, have split?  How do I go about claiming this split?  What does that all mean, do I end up with .1 BTC now?

I think I'll stick with my current profitability and pool it up.  Thanks.

Just curious, as someone who attempted to mine back when BTC was new, around 2010, I tried to do solo mining because, well, I didn't know what the heck I was really doing so I didn't know how to connect to a pool or anything and after the first few days I saw nothing going on so I just thought I was doing something wrong and stopped.  
Now I'm mining for a pool and obviously see results, be it small ones, but I'm curious as to the average wait time to expect said "jackpots" doing solo mining and what kind of numbers I'd be looking at with doing ~600 Mhash/s.

Thanks a lot for the replies guys, you've helped to clear things up for me.  I knew MtGox had been down for maintenance and the DDoS but didn't factor that into why their price hadn't moved.  Looks like the market crashed pretty hard then from it's peak a few days ago at 260 down to &gt;100.
Is this to be the norm now?  Has this so called "bubble" popped already or is this just the ups and downs of a "new", unregulated market?
