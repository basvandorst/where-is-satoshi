Were deep enough now where you need to do your own research. No hand holding.

yes. bitcoin has rocketed the past week. This is completely normal.

its called margin trading, or leveraging

but you could get them for not declaring it on their taxes. this is exactly how they took down the mob in the 40s and 50s

not saying it wont. but every bubble starts by people saying it will always go up. Id say a mindset of credulity is warranted.

Well he manipulated bitcoin which underlies the etns. Value thus manipulating it's value. Not a securities expert but the spirit of the law is in violation.

well that explains the dip in price then

The problem is that in most ways bitcoin is still a passthough currency. For instance the major bulk (and attraction) to bitcoin is for use on silk road and other black market sites, but most vendors peg bitcoin to USD. The net result of a transaction is supply and demand equal out, and they cancel out after the short period between vendors obtaining the bitcoin and cashing out.
This is unique but not unheard of in currency markets. But the main driver of currency prices in most situations is interest rates and trade imbalances, both work as a one way stream. (1) the interest rate in one country A is higher than in B therefore currency A increases as money moves one way from B to A to capitalize on the higher interest rate. (2) Korea exports and sells to the US, therefore to move funds beck from US to Korea they need to exchange dollars for won, increasing supply of USD and increasing demand for won(driving up the price in a one way transaction) bitcoin possesses neither of these traits.
That means that it doesn't matter what the bitcoin price is for many users of bitcoin, it could be .05 bitcoin or 500, what matters is the USD price. Poker would work the same way with granted the caveat of having longer intermediate transaction times, the length of which would be uncertain. Higher transaction times would mean a lower velocity of money, and thus a higher price all else equal.
The price of bitcoins therefore is largely irrelevant to many users, the price has to be going up for some reason other than demand for goods denominated in bitcoins, the only other possibility I can see is novelty-no-sellers and speculation, both of which cannot sustain bubble prices.

Multicolinearity in its purest form.
Ask/bid is determined by the qty and price. a better measure would be to normalize the number of ask/bids at the given price point.

Demand will drive up the price, not supply. If i recall the supply of bitcoin increases at a decreasing rate.

I guess it doesn't prevent it from occurring, but when you cant print the money you are spending you have to get it from somewhere. and the borrowing from the fed who makes money out of thin air for this stimulus is effectively an increase in the money supply in the same way monetary stimulus is, where the objective of monetary stimulus is to lower the interest rate and boost lending
So it doesn't prevent it I guess, it just tacks on the side effect of higher interest rates.

These are famous last words.
Im sorry but no it isn't. Bitcoin is a currency, it might have some properties that give it value above other currencies, but it still reacts to the same exact forces that every other currency or commodity does, supply and demand, mv = pq, ease of use, and others.
What we see right now is a bubble. Things dont increase in price by double/triple digits in the span of the week without a very good reason. Bitcoin has not gone though changes in the past week that warrants this: There is no added functionality that would increase value or no massive increase in usage. This rise in price is entirely due to the perceptions of those in the market. In effect we have a beauty pageant situation in which the value of the currency is based on everyone else's perceived value of everyone else's value of everyone else's value, etc. This is NOT a good thing.
Its a runaway train, that is until we run out of coal, so CHOO CHOO motherfucker.

It does restrict fiscal stimus. The object of the fiscal stimulus is to increase government spening higher than it would otehrwise be to induce demand. Right now effectively we are able to increase that spending and not bear the costs of it due to us printing treasuries and having the fed buy them, lowering the interest rate. The money that the fed uses to buy these effectively comes out of thin air.
If bitcoins were used there would be no way to print that free money and they would have to borrow it from the public which would lead to a rise in interest rates that would not occur under a fed based system.
