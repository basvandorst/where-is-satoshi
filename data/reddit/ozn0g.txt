The cost is irrelevant.
As long as there are enough nodes for the network to work.
The idea that "users" have some power keeping their nodes at home is a utopian dream. It's a hoax.
In a PoW-based network the miners have full control.
Nodes are always cheap.
Hard but true.

"IN CODE WE TRUST"
Incredibly wrong!
The code is not trustworthy.
And if you trust the code... written by who?
Bitcoin is based on trust in mathematics (encryption, hashpower, etc.).
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:28:28
I experienced transactions over 4 hours and fees out of control.
There are many videos and texts explaining that Bitcoin is fast and cheap.
For some days that was a lie.

Since 2015 Bitcoin Core.
For a flew months Bitcoin Unlimited.
But my thesis is that if I had 3,000 nodes, my weight in the network would be the same: none.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:37:06
Oh, I understand jeje.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:12:25
Yes, recently.

The Bitcoin Core problem is not ASIC technology.
ASIC technology is just a technical optimization.
That increases centralization, it is true.
But the root problem of Bitcoin Core are the miners in general.
The interest of any ASIC, GPU or CPU miner is to have future commissions.
Commissions that belong to them by design in any crypto, algorithm or hardware.
Bitcoin Core wants to change this, taking an undetermined percentage of transactions -but relevant- out of the blockchain.
This is a torpedo under the waterline of any miner.
And this will always create a conflict between some developers with excessive power and the miners of cryptocurrency (who have the power by design).
Put another way, Bitcoin Core can desperately change the PoW for example to sha3.
It will further destroy the community and we will all lose.
But even if it is successful, in time we will return to the same dispute for "future commissions".

I'm learning English, excuse me.
I think this is the reality.
Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work and the security to survive government attacks is based on this.
China is the biggest and best chip maker.
Before it was USA but lost the word "Silicon" of the Valley.
And do not worry that the miners will always reach an agreement to distribute the costs of deployment of the nodes that are needed, if that is what you are worried about.
Bitcoin is like this. We knew it from the beginning.
The people -including developers- can only speak, thankfully.
Otherwise it would not work and Satoshi knew it.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:39:02
It is not the attack of 51%.
It is simply that a well coordinated 85% mining consensus can and should neutralize any minority blockchain.
The client with more number of nodes is irrelevant.
Sufficient enough to propagate the network.
You must really think about who has control over a PoW-based network.
You can not go against this simple logic.
In a PoW-based network the miners have control.
It is the original design of Satoshi.
Any substitute will be an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:09:37
That today there is only one manufacturer of ASIC is something temporary according to the logic of the market.
And there are only two manufacturers of GPUs. They are exhausted and basically form a duopoly.
What you suggest is that developers have the power to do what they want and change the PoW algorithm whenever they want.
To do this you did not have to have waited for the original paper of 2009.
They could have done it in 2000.
I insist. The root of the conflict is not the fashion mining technology.
The conflict is because a team of developers who lost everything in MT.Gox are thirsting for ambition and intend to take future commissions in their own private side-chain.

I come to learn and find the truth. Thank you.

Independent of quality, more clients mean more decentralization. Yes or yes.
The checkmate of the miners will be the creation of the first block bigger than 1MB in the longest blockchain.
Bitcoin Core's limited blockchain will be attacked with the mining of empty blocks to break its viability.
Bitcoin Core can only change the PoW desperately by creating a new altcoin.
This is the determining OPSEC with lower risk.
Only possible with a great mining consensus.
They already have it.
I have been commenting for some time:
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:02:36
You're right, it's relative to the level of quality you expect from Bitcoin.
Maybe I'm very picky. I want to pay everything with a Bitcoin fast, cheap and very strong.
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:40:44
If anyone can perform this attack (demonstrated empirically) is not alarm?
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:28:56
The problem of scalability does not exist.
What exists is an arbitrary limitation of transactions per second by a series of personal interests.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:38:54
You must recognize as soon as possible that the nodes have no power over the blockchain.
Nodes or supernodes are irrelevant while someone deployed enough.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:12:24
I value your optimism.
But disputes between groups of people are repeatable.
If the cryptocurrencies break down every time there is a controversy, our dreams will never be realized.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:35:54
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:16:04
I've tried to argue.
As your opinion is the official here you think you can say what you want.

@_date: 2017-07-24 13:11:49
While some celebrate the activation of Segwit -granted by the miners- others are decentralizing development with more and more alternative client programs.
The next move and checkmate is the big block.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:05:23
They have full control over the blockchain. And therefore total control over Bitcoin.
Only miners can add new pages to the ledger.
And this fact is guaranteed with trillions of hashes per second that provide security.
Nodes only transmit this information.
Nodes can not cast negative votes (it would never work).
Only positive votes, validations.
And developers -those who like takeovers so much- you can see that luckily this monopoly is being masterfully broken.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:09:27
It is a limit well above current use.
And you know perfectly well that it is to mitigate DDoS.
It was Satoshi's idea. Perverted by Bitcoin Core.
It is the excuse to take the commissions out of the chain, to take them in private.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:23:21
Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:39:37
And Bitcoin Cash after the pump will mine empty blocks in Bitcoin Core until the infarction.

That anyone can make that attack delaying transfers for hours and firing the commissions do not alarm you?
This is real, not virtual.

The point is that it empirically demonstrates that an "unlimited amount of BTC" is not necessary to collapse the system.
Bottlenecks only occur in weak (or artificially limited) systems.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:19:24
At least they do not put an artificial limit on transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:01:57
Returning to the topic.
If Bitcoin sets the precedent that a disagreement between developers and miners causes a hardfork, then in the long run all cryptocurrencies are vulnerable.
I wish I did not. :(
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:49:37


That's right!
In a PoW-based network the miners are always in control.
And the miners in turn are subject to the market price.
The honesty of the miners is irrelevant, they are normal human beings acting for their own interest.
This is Bitcoin.
This design is intentional.
We are testing the last sentence of the last paragraph of the Bitcoin paper.
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:23:20
You mean Bitcoin is really based on Proof-of-IP?
You mean that if I deploy for example 1000 nodes -cheap and easier- I will have some relevant power in the network?
Are you aware that keeping a node on the internet costs only 20 dollars a month?
Do you think that the deployment of enough nodes -not many- is beyond the economic and technical reach of the miners?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:34:43
Of course the nodes are necessary.
Although I think the minimum number of nodes required is hundreds, not thousands.
But the key thing I want to say is that nodes are cheap.
Really cheap. They currently require little capacity and consume little electricity.
There is an extreme competition of hostings offering servers of this type.
We speak of between 15 and 30 dollars per month per node.
It is the harsh reality.
I have three nodes deployed, because I like it.
But if I had 300 nodes, my control over the Bitcoin network would not be significantly higher.
In a PoW-based network the miners will ALWAYS have the skillet by the handle.
We can change the algorithm and after some time we will return to the same conflict.
This design is deliberate.
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:52:17
I think it's wrong.
It suggests that developers are adults with control and miners a helpless baby.
Reality is the opposite.
In a work-based network, those who have the computing power are in control.
So much so, that Segwit has not been able to celebrate until the miners with a fantastic consensus have said yes.
When the miners voted in the blockchain, we watched.
As you have noted, more than three alternative Bitcoin client programs have been developed.
While some celebrate a pseudo-battle (BIP 91), the miners make the next move toward checkmate.
Because their long-term risk leads them to prudence.
And prudence allows wisdom.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:48:57
To be clear.
In your opinion, who rules in Bitcoin and in what percentage?
    __% Developers (By takeover)
    __% Exchangers (By plutocracy)
    __% Nodes      (By IP)
    __% Miners     (By hashrate)
