This is the same if you lost a plastig bag that contains a bunch of money, sadly it cannot be returned.

Let me check it first if it's really one whole bitcoin, send it here: 1Ne5eR3L6W48KentupWC7kdriBQXYPjiME
Edit: There's a lot of fake bitcoins proliferating around like unlimited, abc, cash, etc.

It's the bankers who are destroying the dollar by printing money out of nothing and without a real asset to back it up besides Gov't bonds thus devaluing it deeper.

These bankers are just afraid about a decentralized currencies because they will lose grip of their power over vast sectors of society once cryptocurrencies go mainstream and people starts dumping their paper money which they create out of thin air as well via fractional reserve

I have 2 coming from a betting site and it's still unconfirmed for more than 12 hrs
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:07:45
I have 2 txn pending for more than 12hrs you're not alone man.
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:53:07
You're not alone man. I also got 2 txn stuck for almost 19hrs now because the sports betting site where I withdrew the BTC just paid a meager txn fees of 20 Satoshis per byte. Smh
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:12:16
I know what betting site you're using because I also have 2 unconfirmed txn coming from them and they pay $.03 txn fees on both, waiting for more than 12hrs now and counting.

Try localbitcoins or paxful
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:17:23
I use paxful and I haven't had any problem so far though you should still be cautious on dealing anything with anyone anywhere.

@_date: 2017-07-28 09:05:44
Probably people are buying to have access to free money when bitcoin cash forks on Aug 1. then dump it, because a lot of exchanges (latest is bittrex announcing) are now confirming to give its users their share of bitcoin cash after fork.

@_date: 2017-07-18 09:56:08
I would base it according to the total market share of each coin I choose to invest in and maybe gamble a little bit on the coin which I think has the highest potential to replicate the success of bitcoin, also in that way my profit will grow or decline rationally with the whole industry.

That's why I'm moving now to LTC because I can no longer send micro payments using BTC with the currently absurd txn fees while by using LTC you'll just spend around 1100 satoshis per txn

Satoshi came from the future, he knew what will happen to the current centralized financial system run by small group of bankers thus he created bitcoin to help the majority but he needed to get back to where he came from.
Edit: Ever wonder why his original bitcoins never move? Because he was from the future, we can only see his transactions when we get to year 2140 when all bitcoins are mined already

My guess is you're using an exchange wallet, they are putting your bitcoins on their cold storage for "safe" keeping, but your total bitcoins reflecting on your account should be the same if you sum it up

Me not buying when it was hovering around $200 since I first knew about bitcoin early 2015 if only I follow my intuition to buy 100 btc back then I would have made a good amount of fortune in just 2 years time.
