Honeyminer is similar to NiceHash, but does not operate the same way AT ALL. 
NiceHash uses an open bidding market to allow 3rd parties to buy your hashrate. This allows for nefarious actors to purchase 51% attacks against projects and hurts the mining community as a whole.
Honeyminer has no market to purchase hash power. You mine projects based on which is most profitable for your hardware. This combined with data on total hashrate and difficulty, allows Honeyminer to select which coin, we support, that is the most profitable for you to mine and mines it directly.
It then converts those earnings to BTC for payout.
In the near future the program will allow for payouts in the coins you mine directly.
The team also works directly with many developers on coin projects to add those projects to Honeyminer in a way the developers want.
Also recently Honeyminer released Honeyminer MAX it's Linux miner that is significantly more profitable than NH.
You can check it out below.
