Who exactly is stealing what from whom?

So you're saying someone should have done a research on the sites but YOU don't have to?

Don't go solo. Take a wookie with you.

But noone can create more bitcoins to save these banks/companies if such a fraud comes out.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:39:22
I'm sorry, but that's just jealousy.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:01:39
Who is this person?
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:09:19
Doesn't matter, she's telling the truth.
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:17:48
That depends on how long the issue existed before they wrote "Investigation" ;)
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:36:29
I don't like the "bit" either.

It's a good thing that you're skeptical about statistical data visualization because many people try to misuse it.
But being skeptical is not enough. The difficulty is to seperate the good from the bad visualizations, or to identify errors in charts etc.
The problem is that visualized data can be interpreted differently most of the times because of the complexity of today's data structures and volume. So you should really read into the topic.

I laughed a bit. Oh wait, are you serious? I should start to cry then.

Bought 200 mBTC on Jan 5th without problems. Maybe the value isn't high enough for Sparkasse to block this transfer...
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:55:14
There is no global value to any good on this planet. For some the value is high, but for most of the people the value of bitcoin is still zero, whatever the reasons are. The value of bitcoin seems global, because we have the internet which makes it possible for everyone to compete with the other people on the world, so that differences even out.

She needs to have a parent/relative for any other kind of money too, so this argument doesn't count.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:11:07
That's a completely other discussion than my comment was related to.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:15:00
The point of this thread is that a ten year old can't easily buy in the digital world.
Your point is that these kids can't obtain their bitcoins easily.
And my point is that they can't get *any* money easily. That's why I called your argument pointless.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:21:58
Yeah, I also already thought about getting some cheap coins. 
Maybe we will never see such a low price again. Nobody knows. :)
(btw. thank you for teaching me that "second" can be a synonym for "support" :D)
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:43:08
I have an additional question, maybe someone can answer it too:
How will transactions work when no further block is created to accept it?
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:26:58
Thanks!
