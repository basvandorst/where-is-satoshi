Thanks, I found this very useful as an analogy. Also happy birthday!
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:03:06
Interesting, thanks for your input. So if I regularly do bitcoin transactions in one place, let's say chain of supermarkets, I should open a LN channel between me and the chain. What I wonder is that can I open multiple channels between companies and other entities and have them all linked to one address of bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:50:29
So this is huge news if it can be implented correctly. Could you see one entity acting as a main hub for everyone else to connect? What are the known negatives if any are known? Thank you for the answer!
@_date: 2016-04-05 18:50:38
Thank you! Sounds very promising.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:09:55
Yeah, there was some serious hype behind it and that reflected in the price. Just with like every bitcoin run up and crash down, so I don't get what's the point of your comment... considering the space we're in and the history. Hahahaha?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:04:28
Does this mean it isn't always great time to use Bitcoin? What should we use instead in those times?
@_date: 2019-07-04 22:02:08
Lol, wtf, like there are no better coins out there than Dogecoin. Hell the world's biggest companies are adopting and building on Ethereum as we speak. Get a grip, you might be still drinking the kool aid.
People are tribalist by nature, some see the bigger picture. There'a lot more going on in this space than any one coin can cover, Bitcoin is a safe bet with its limited supply and the name recognition, but there are lot of cool projects going on on Ethereum alone like Maker and the platform EY is building there. And I don't know shit about what's going on the other 100 chains... But being bitcoin maximalist gets the most upvotes here, and calling everything else shitcoins and people eat that shit up.
Perhaps it's time to widen your point of view, see what the other people and companies are doing in the crypto space, some of them might be the new Apple's and Googles of the future.
Also: stay away from Ripple people but check out chainlink ;)
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:30:04
Well those are wise words, I wish everyone would share your sentiment, but I guess that comes with time and experience. 
It's good process to strip every coin down to its bare bones and see what value it offers for the users, dogecoin is a good "meme" coin to learn how to use blockchains for example and Litecoin is alternative to Bitcoin. I think the correlation will dwindle down over time. Other coins need their own standalone apps that large amount of people use every day, we're not quite there yet but perhaps in 5 years at least Ethereum will stand on its own, mostly. But I don't really see how Bitcoin could fail, it does its intended job well. The limited supply is a strong attribute, we're never seen that before, ever, it will be interesting how high the price will be in 20 years. 
And yes, we should support all proper crypto services,  especially those that are decentralized, they're pioneers and pushing crypto more to being used every day and we need more use cases other than Hodling and memeing about the price in hopes of making ourselves rich.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:16:03
I'd give it a few years myself, they're making progress. Meanwhile the ecosystem is maturing with DeFi dapps popping up like mushrooms after the rain. 
The node question is interesting, isn't sharding being implemented just for that? Everyone will hold just a piece rather than the full blockchain history? So where's the demise if that's implemented? 
I'm just glad we have options, and chains exploring different possibilities. In the end humanity as a whole will benefit of it the most.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:08:44
Few years to implement such tech is nothing, I'd be worried if it doesn't come out in 2 years though. If I remember right they recently locked down the planning of it, now it's just down to implementation. I'm talking of sharding and POS here, not about all the other layer 2 scaling solutions (plasma is the safest and is soon on mainnet, it's been on testnet for a while now)
Also, I own many coins, including bitcoin. There'll be a few winners and I don't intend to miss out on all of them, though the space is just too huge to follow closely on so people tend to pick couple to follow on and support.
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:30:45
Isn't tether using ethereum mostly these days?
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:16:56
I thought they already have several layer 2 scaling solutions available and in use and a trustless one like Plasma hitting the mainnet soon. Have we been following the same news? I admit, there's a lot going on over at the Ethereum side so that can be hard. It's easier here with Bitcoin and the slow and steady pace.
Why does company like EY, which is one of the worlds largest auditing company, build solely on Ethereum AND makes the software open sourced, without licenses, to drive adoption if Ethereum, according to your words, is off the rails?
Which to believe, random redditor or EY? Or any other forbes500 company that's adopting Ethereum or the majority of devs, that have chosen to build on Ethereum? So yes, let's face the truth instead and forget the maximalist stuff. There are other cryptocurrencies worth taking a look besides the first that was created. Just like in any other technology category (MySpace, AOL, Napster) - You get my point.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:24:02
I'd like to see you or anyone for that matter create some bitcoin from thin air, let me know how much it'll cost you. That's the beauty of it, but you know it but choose to ignore it as "not much different" points it out yet you're on this sub.

Could you explain what this MMM has to offer since you're a member? Only heard about it in here and I'd like to know more. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:36:20
I did mean it as a joke for these reasons you mentioned. But clearly I'm bad with jokes so it's ok. People don't like to think about the poor making their cheap clothes in slave conditions, now they can actually lead themselves to believe they are helping while taking advantage of the system. Now I'm not saying I know the situation behind the gift cards in third world, never heard of it to be exact.

Hah, isn't it always? I might have looked a bit naive with my first post, but with plenty of replies from fellow redditors my view on this has widened. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:57:21
For now, yes. One can hope in the future this isn't necessary. Give it time.

Money and the power that comes with it corrupts, it's a human nature. Everything has a price, they say.
 I'm sure there is plenty of corruption in the countrys you mentioned, it's just disguised as lobbying etc. "more civilized" methods. And root of this all is our current monetary system, the fiat money or should I say funny money?
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:48:17
I remember no such talks when I participated in dogecoin community very actively via dogecoin subreddit and irc. You did notice I mentioned "atleast in the start". By that I mean the time around the jamaican bobsled and such. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:33:17
No idea to be honest but it will be interesting to see what happens, if anything.

I'm just pulling things out of my hat here but price levels will spike:
1.When people, the consumers, start lending money again from banks.
2.When dollar loses it's status as a world reserve currency and dollars around the world come back home.
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:16:28
Interesting. Thanks for all the answers! Will look more into these.
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:48:17
Considering the current monetary policies and the situation I doubt that would be a good idea. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:05:51
You're welcome. 
10 years is a long time, anything could happen knowing that central banks have their printing presses on full steam 24/7 around the world. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:02:13
I can agree with many views Amir has. We need to remember why bitcoin was made by Satoshi and not be clouded by just the possible profits. Even if bitcoin fails blockchain will live though, so I'm hopefull we'll see it free mankind of the chains it calls current monetary system.

@_date: 2015-05-27 11:32:19
I'm sorry, haven't followed the debate very closely, but could someone with more knowledge on the issue explain few things :
-With the current growing rate of block sizes, how long into the future we could go with 20mb? 
-Why 20mb and not something that would scale over time reducing the need for future forks regarding block sizes?
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:06:04
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-10-19 03:41:31
Moolah had almost a god like status in the dogecoin community, atleast in the start. I remember they offered "piece of a pie", their future profits, if you invested in them and it was sold out quite fast. 
They did big donations for pr and stuff like that. Shame to see people being ripped of left and right these days.
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:58:21
You're not just debating him but you are making classic look bad by not backing up your claims. Don't run around making these statements if you don't have the time or the will to explain them because to people like me, who are undecided on the issue, will make notice of how you are representing classic. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:30:40
Well then, could someone just say where does the money go? Who are the ultimate recipients?

Ah yes, sorry. You're right.
@_date: 2019-03-01 10:59:43
Thank you for making that clear
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:19:56
Is this related to the huge dump that bitcoin is going through right now? Are people not happy with the direction core(blockstream) is taking bitcoin? I haven't followed this space closely for now but some say blockstream is making bitcoin resemble fiat, where unlimited printing can be done? Is this possible through liquid? I'm a bit concerned myself.
I always thought bitcoin was about decentralization, but limiting blocks and then pushing own products on top of it that are needed because of said limitation seem like a route that is taking the original vision of Satoshi and throwing it to garbage can. 
Was Satoshi wrong all along or the markets that seem to be not happy with this liquid system?
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:08:49
Could you also undo the liquid released by Blockstream(core)? I guess that has more to do with the recent dump, no?
@_date: 2019-08-01 09:11:21
I don't think the blockchain size has anything to do with making sharding harder, and I'm quite sure given enough time they'll get it right. And as I said, if I remember correctly, the sharding system is already designed and just needs to be coded.
We'll be wiser at 2020

Yes, The CEO of the EEA understands what the EEA is but you clearly don't, he's talking of companies using copies of Ethereum in their private networks. (You might want to see how internet evolved, the same is happening here) Are you really that clueless or do you just have your head very deep in the sand? Typical btc maximalist behavior... You seem to be pretty clueless yourself, good luck circle jerking with words like"alt coin gamblers and fairy tales" to make yourself feel good, you must need it while ethereum continues to be the preferred choice of companies like Samsung ;) 
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:33:07
Eth seems to be the obvious choice when you take into account the amount of devs it is attracting and how fast a vibrant ecosystem is forming on top of it. Obvious to anyone who follows more than just btc at least!
Just look at Maker and how its product is being used by other dapps, Veil is good example of a service that uses several other dapps. Company like Samsung knows where this will lead
@_date: 2019-02-28 11:22:34
" **BTC's block size has been constrained to a mere 1MB so anyone can afford to run a node, but users are expected to transact on  which requires multiple hard drives and an always-online full node that causes users to lose all their money if it goes offline** "
Stumbled on this on internet, does this have any truth in it? Haven't been following btc for some time after the block limit debate
@_date: 2019-02-21 10:16:46
So once Eth goes full PoS Tesla will jump in, that's good for btc as well.
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:26:11
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:49:02


Yes, it has existed in one form before, but Eth clearly made it more accessible for people. 
I for one, prefer a decentralized bank protocol like Maker over an similar centralized service. That applies to almost anything, less middlemen, less fees, simple. As I said, there's 80 million of Dai stablecoin in existence, and it's still a beta product. It'll be huge one day.
Not everyone needs to run full archival nodes, as was Satoshis originial vision, about original bitcoin. It's good that we have alternatives from all sides of spectrum, competition tends to push the space forward faster.
Ethereum is advancing and that makes me excited for cryptospace again, after years of being disappointed with Bitcoin.
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, clearly you do not know what it is.
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:07:55
Thank you for answering! 
So how much has the limit been raised to? I remember that in Satoshi's original vision the limit was supposed to be lifted all together.
So lightning isn't a must use now but perhaps will in future, if there's small block limit in place still and people want fast and small fee transactions? I'm talking of a case where crypto hits mainstream, that's the aim after all.
And interesting info about lite wallets and watchtowers + the need for quite pricey hardware for 3rd world citizens who were used to defend small block limit in the first case. 
Nonetheless, since there's options these days it's all okay. Will check back how things evolve in few years. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:36:54
Thank you for a interesting point of view that I haven't really considered! I guess there's a need for both POW and POS, some companies will have to use POS just because of these ideals though, like Tesla that rides a lot on them.
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:33:14
Only one? Then my guess would be ETH, but I'm sure for example Maker can use wrapped btc as one of its collateral to draw Dai, so btc will exist in some capacity, just pulling your leg ;) 
@_date: 2019-04-30 08:05:57
Kind a hard to relax, clearly he's looking into Ethereum. Elon has a huge following when it comes to nerds and those are the people that are early adopters,innovators and builders and are crucial in becoming truly mainstream tech.

That's nice. I guess then that either I catched the traffic yesterday or Mycelium offers way too high fee options to its users in mobile wallet, fast transactions were given over 1 dollar fees as an recommendation... Anyways, are there any talks of increasing the base block size? If I remember correctly, core promised the miners that long time ago when they flew off to Asia. Or are we just going to stay at 1mb forever which wasn't the plan to start with until Blockstream gained 55 million investment? Haven't followed Bitcoin so much lately so I'm a bit out of the loop.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:10:45
Did the store accept btc directly? If yes, how long did it take for transaction to confirm and how much fees did you pay?

Hey fellow bitcoiners, why the hell Elon Musk is tweeting about Ethereum and not Bitcoin? It's baffling to me how no matter how hard we're innovating here year after year, one of the biggest entrepreneurs of our time still seems to praise some altcoin. How can we make Elon see the light and not go ahead and adopt Ethereum as a fundamental part of his vision for future? What am I missing that Elon isn't?! I've heard he's a smart guy after all...
