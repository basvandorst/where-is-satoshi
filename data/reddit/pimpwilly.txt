You're comparing a company to a currency

My understanding is, there is a fixed amount of bitcoins that can ever exist. They are generated via a logrithmic function, such that there will only ever be 21million bitcoins. (As of right now, 81% of all bitcoins that will ever be mined already exist. That number was 50% as of the end of 2011).
The amount rewarded is halved each time. Such that if you mine early, you get way more rewards than when you mine later. Like, exponentially more.
Thats why its pretty obviously a ponzi scheme. Its idea is to pay out to people who get in early, while people who get in late are  the ones who get suckered. 
That doesn't make it not viable, but theres no doubting the truth that the whole system is intended to reward those who started it

Artificially making sure it's steadily declining over time does though

People holding coin have no reason to spend them right now, because of the fluctuation in prices. Like the guy who bought the first pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, roughly 5 million or so in todays value. Why would anybody do anything other than horde and speculate on future value like gold?
Sellers should in theory be more willing to take the risk, but yet theres always the chance the whole system collapses in a week and then it goes to 0.
The whole system is propped up by mining, a system created to reward early adopters, which loses is value over time. It just seems like a ticking time bomb to me long term.

That increases the total number of coins again, which destabalizes the entire thing making them valuable in the first place doesn't it?
