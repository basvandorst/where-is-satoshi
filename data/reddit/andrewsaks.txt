Very interesting move. I wonder if the proposed regulation is likely to ensure that BTC is still anonymous at the receiving end, or whether it will help financial firms wishing to accept BTC do their compliance KYC/AML procedures. 
For example, if Agora Commodities accepts Bitcoins for physical commodities, will they be able to comply with KYC/AML regulations if BTC gains any regulated status? Interesting times...

 - The thing is, it is true that the peso fluctuates wildly and is unstable/unpredictable and has massive inflation rates, but that doesnt matter. The supply/demand is not bitcoins against peso, it is Bitcoin values in Argentina compared to Bitcoin values in less restricted countries such as Uruguay - where BTC Global are based. Its more to do with Argentinians using it as a means of avoiding having their dollars lunched by the government and not getting stuck with worthless Argentine fiat currency that they cant shift, cant use overseas and get ripped off every time they have to ask the government's permission to change some travel money. Even if you have dollars, in the end, by the nature of making purchases in Argentina and long enough of receiving salary in peso will eventually ensure that all of those dollars become peso, and i would think that is something Argentinians do not like the thought of. For example, if an Argentinian buys a new car with Dollars, then three years later sells it, he will get pesos for it - whereas before 2011 he could have got dollars for it. By using bitcoins and merchants accepting them, it gets rid of all of those risks. Makes perfect sense to me...

I think its popularity is a good thing and it is settling down in its fluctuations since being a well recognized currency. The days of being able to do what Kristoffer Koch did in Norway I think are probably over....
He made a $27 investment and got over $880,000 just by waiting four years for the prices to go up...

Hi Krampus. Were you at the BTC Global Bitcoin MeetUp in Buenos Aires?

I would say a 30 to 40% increase in value over bitcoin values in neighboring Uruguay plus BTC Global turning up at a 180-strong convention, plus retail outlets starting to prefer bitcoins to credit cards is enough evidence of high demand....

btccc that makes sense regarding supply, however demand is being created because of the strict rules on currency. In the UK the GBP is not restricted by the government so all is well and people don't necessarily need to "panic buy" bitcoins but in Argentina where the government could potentially take everyone's dollars in exchange for a cedin, and the peso is depreciating like a falling rock / restricted, then i guess the bitcoin is probably seen there as a sensible option. I would be very interested to hear from anyone who went to the MeetUp in BA

Apparently not - as far as the ban is concerned, it appears that the trading, exchange and usage of BTC in Thailand is completely illegal - the exchange has suspended its activities on this basis also. Not sure that there is any specified limit, looks to me as though it is completely illegal altogether

where is here?

I think virtual currencies (whether Bitcoin is one of them or not) may become more prevalent if Cyprus-style bank haircuts get applied across europe... The legal precedent is there...

the main difference in prices resides in the following:
- Uruguay trades in international bitcoin/usd prices or in pesos at the official exchange rate,
- in Argentina no one wants to give away their dollars and they only trade in ARS, and since the ARS has an official exchange rate and and many unofficial exchange rates (official 5.41ARS for USD and up to 8ARS for USD unofficially) the prices paid in pesos for bitcoin can be up to a 40% higher on the street.
And since no one trades at official values because its not publicly accepted, the price is always at least 30% higher.
If you need hard facts, you can look up the official exchange rate for ARS and look up how much people are paying for bitcoins in ARS here:
