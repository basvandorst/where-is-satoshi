Maybe explore how bitcoin behaves as a bearer instrument? What are it's prospects? Why is it a bearer instrument? Etc.

SJXC is a counterparty token and counterparty "runs on" the bitcoin blockchain.

Both Keza and Abra are both a lot more worthy of this reward in my opinion. OB is just a reinvented web store that needs other people to run the software, like a bad version of a regular online store. Also sad that none of the startups actually use bitcoin in any technically innovating way :/
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:40:14
What happens when the thing buy breaks 1 month after you buy it and the seller refuses to refund your money? Can the moderator solve this as well? =))
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:59:30
I have no idea why you are being so salty. It's legit question. If I am to start selling I need to know how large the market is, right? And yes, a WooCommerce store with a bitcoin plugin would at least get me a bigger market than... what? 150 non vendor/moderator nodes.
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:31:04
Explain to me how this is more revolutionary than running an instance of say... WooCommerce with a bitcoin accepting plugin.
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:57:05
What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:59:45
Thanks for the information!
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:41:52
But how many are actually using it?
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:38:58
Why the hell would you need personal identification to use open source software? Who says you can't be relatively anonymous when you use woocommerce? You are aware that you can setup a store front as a TOR hidden service, right?
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:09:11
Evidence of what? That I am not convinced that the technology is good? It's not really relevant. My question pertains to the business side of things. How big is the market? Is it worth investing in setting up a store? What are the opportunity costs? Etc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:54:46
That’s not an ETF.
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:19:26
Looking forward to running a Storj Node :)

What's it got to do with Bitcoin? Other than the fact that they accept Bitcoin deposits it seems like some kind of startup bank.
What claims are you skeptical about?
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:48:28
Stateless (less so) and censorship resistant (more so) are big selling points to individuals who are buying or selling services or products that are - surprise - being censored by states. You know... Like cocaine or other drugs.
Just because they are not big selling points to you does not mean they are not big selling points. If you don't believe me, look at the amounts of products that are sold and bought on "Darknet Markets". I do not think you realize how any people are actually involved in this... Even so, what do you think about Western Union? What is attractive about it to the "average person"? Hint: not much. Is it your opinion that Bitcoin has to be used by a majority of people on the world in order to be useful? Hint: it doesn't.

Great! More confirmation that she is a scammer and con artist :)
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:36:12
Why would I want to use this rather than any of the other mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay or Android Pay?
Why would I want to use this and complicate things using some weird (from the users perspective) tokens?
How are you going to make money? What is the business model?
@_date: 2016-06-30 11:52:44
Yeah, I meant the news in general.
@_date: 2016-06-26 08:30:45
LocalBitcoins etc. is probably the only way as a minor unless you get an adult to do it for you. Maybe you can get on a bus to an area where it is possible?
@_date: 2016-06-30 11:52:13
Nah, why should I? :)
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:50:54
Yeah... That is obvious. What advantages does it have compared to say... a credit card paired with for example Apple Pay?
I see - so something like 1-3% per deposit?
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:33:24
No, that's not at all what it sounds like. It sounds like they're asking questions and getting a lot of canned bullshit responses. They're simple questions... Especially for someone who has been in the space since 2010 (most likely bullshit as well).
@_date: 2016-06-30 11:57:47
Why would you put your money into mining if you can put your money to work in other areas where the returns are better?
Mining is not charity work and it shouldn't be.
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:36:55
What are you even answering?
What's the point to having tokens?
@_date: 2016-06-30 05:55:21
This was posted like two weeks ago.
@_date: 2016-06-30 05:51:39
Just use your credit card - Bitcoin is shit unless you want to buy illegal things at the moment. Don't let anyone make you think otherwise :)
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:53:13
Why are the tokens needed?
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:09:11
Are you buying drugs online? If you're not then you aren't a bitcoin user. The USER is king yes. Therefore, since the typical user of bitcoin are people buying and selling drugs - we should work on getting them fungibility and anonymity long before block size. I doubt the users of bitcoin care very much if the confirmation time is 10 minutes or 30 minutes -  they just want to pay for their drugs and be done with it.
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:41:55
No, they understand who actually uses Bitcoin - people who buy and sell illegal things. frequenters are not bitcoin users, they are just hodlers who want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:07:58
Wow! Able to buy bitcoin using credit/debit as well as deposit using bank wires now :)
@_date: 2016-05-13 05:54:08
How do I short this shit?
@_date: 2016-05-01 13:05:36
I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense though... Why would people pay more just to get £30 in bitcoin. I really doubt 9flats or any other company generates very much revenue from payments using bitcoin. The person with the flat is probably losing bookings by doing this compared to if he didn't do this.
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:34:02
Ok... So nothing as simple as just accepting deposits in bitcoin and investing it in different instruments on behalf of the customer? Seems to me like that is a much simpler route to go. But I guess that doesn't have all the buzzwords needed  to get funding :)
@_date: 2016-05-11 05:37:53
And when he doesn't get a warning when he goes to pay something with his online bitcoin wallet and it turns out to be a phishing site? Then what happens? =)
@_date: 2016-05-01 12:50:38
Why would you do this instead of just lowering the price?
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:04:08
Does anyone have some technical details on how this might work? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:00:10
Yep! I skimmed through the whitepaper as well. I'm not saying their intention is to scam people, it's just that this is what seems to end up happening with all kinds of crowd fundings when it involves some kind of "coin".
@_date: 2016-05-24 01:08:32
Where is the section on crowd sales? :)
@_date: 2016-05-01 04:50:53
We don't have this problem in Sweden. Here you can transfer up to 150 000:- (~$19000) instantly between accounts and between banks. For free. Granted, I can not transfer to banks outside of Sweden using this system. I do not often need to do that though. If I do it's not really a problem for me to pay like $1 and make a SEPA transfer.
I'm sure it's similarly simple in many other EU countries. Anything related to banking seems very retarded and backwards in America. I have no idea how checks can still be a thing. I actually got one in the mail a couple of years back from a company in the states. Could not figure out how to cash it. Literally the first time in my life I saw a check. I was 24. :)
@_date: 2016-05-13 06:09:09
Well! I'll be damned! They're doing a crowd sale! What a surprise! Quick! Everyone! Invest to get-rich-quick!
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:50:33
Might this be another scam coin? Stay tuned to find out in a year or two! My bet is on yes! :)

"International Blockchain Real Estate Association"... Must be a big organization... ... ... \*giggle\* ;)
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:54:22
Probably not that much increase in demand. I would think it's more likely to be the decreasing value of the kenyan shilling and the increasing value of Bitcoin:
KES/USD: 
USD/BTC: 
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:53:33
Yep! Seems about right. Somehow I managed to make a brain fart and think that the USD/BTC mattered but it only does if you look at the BTC volume. Does look like quite a big increase in volume, about 10% of it explained by the decrease in value of the KES.
