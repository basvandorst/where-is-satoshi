I mean yeah they're willing, but I think everyone is pretty upset about it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:50:06
You got your friends interested in something you like and you're upset they're interested in it? My friends and family ask me about bitcoin/crypto all the time and I love it, I'll talk about it I'm blue in the face.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:36:20
I have a fairly substantial (but less than $50k) amount of crypto in my hardware wallet, but only a couple thousand in exchanges. Should I worry about reporting This? I thought it only became an issue when I turned it into fiat, like owning gold or stocks. Thanks in advance I really am ignorant about this stuff.
Edit: you already answered my questions sorry
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:40:59
You're not friends with your coworkers?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:57:09
My friends kept saying it might be a bubble, but I got my friend to buy $100 at 4k and yesterday my dad had me buy him 3 ltc. Guess who's getting a ledger for Christmas?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:06
I suppose, but you should feel comfortable saying no to people. Sometimes you gotta do it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:29
Why is this bad? They're probably happy for you
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:15
I've been here since 900 man, and I'm not going anywhere. I just hope we get lightning out soon. It looks really promising. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:51:33
She gets mad when an investment she has no money in goes down? Sounds like she just sucks man.

Doesn't Sweden have public health care?
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:08:39




seems like a pretty straight forward deduction to me, but maybe our definitions of poor are different.
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:22:48
So you put most of your paycheck into bitcoin and then use it to pay bills? That's a little risky but clever too, when it works. I have a decent job and live a comfortable life but I'm still nervous about transferring my savings into btc. I buy enough that if I lost it I wouldn't be in trouble.
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:25:23
what do you mean by dollar cost averaging?
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:02:45
fucking perfect
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:32:40
isn't this kind of the same idea as a low risk bond? or do you see a higher return because of the wider diversity?
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:45:05
I agree but in this context he's definitely saying he doesn't have a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:03:58
I just got my nano s today too, had some trouble until I updated firmware. it works really well, I just wish it plugged straight into a usb drive.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:38:31
I mean if you really want to look at it this way, bitcoin went from less than a dollar to over 1000 under obama.
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:36:35
Yeah that sentence a real doozy
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:32:50
glad to hear he at least apologized, I understand passion but you can express it without being a douche
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:22:50
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:56:42
I'd just be content that you have some at all. Right there you're already miles ahead if it really does take off

@_date: 2017-08-04 23:33:13
I always read the first and last 4 or 5 characters in the address to make sure it's correct.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:49:32
... are you a pirate?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:42:41
what about storing your phrase on a Google document as well as paper? I feel like it's pretty unlikely Google would lose a file, I think they store files on multiple drives for that reason.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:32:48
you sound really
satisfied 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:32:11
I think you misread, I said I check the first 4 and last 4
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:04:58
Was that copy pasta or something? That was one of the craziest things I've ever read lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:52:24
Lol I've been there man, wish I would've held onto them instead but here we are.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:04:12
Dude think about this: 115 ish btc is a million bucks
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:11
Yep, you can buy as much or as little as you like.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:10:27
It's gonna be tough, but just keep your coins offline and don't do any transactions until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:29:35
There are several projects involving second and third layers to make it more viable as a currency, but right now it's somewhat inconvenient, depending on the implementation. Buying a steam game with btc is actually surprisingly easy, but still not as easy as one click with a pre saved card.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:26:22
We could take a hint from r/litecoin and start running phone call campaigns to get more companies to accept btc. 
Another big issue is that it needs to be instant. I buy games from steam with btc all the time, but Its a lot slower than a credit card transaction, and a lot more technical. The layman isn't going to want to copy and paste an address or even scan a qr code. We need an instant verification process, that will probably come in the form of a 2nd layer like ln.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:09
I remember! I bought at 900, bought more when it hit 1000, then watched it tank lol. But I'm pretty happy I didn't sell now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:25:18


That sentence is making me hard
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:37:59
Fuck. Full coin club with a focus st, I'm like you but worse in every way.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:53:18
You're both right and wrong. Nuclear done correctly is way better for the environment than coal or cogens, as it has no emissions besides steam and an incredibly small amount of waste for the amount of power created.
However, done incorrectly it is catastrophic.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:42:43
That's where it gets beyond me, but I believe that's why there are 2 processors inside of it, one cannot be accessed externally.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:20:33
Bitcoin that couldn't be taken off an exchange would just be paypal. The whole point is that you and only you control your money, nobody else (paypal, banks, government) can touch it. 
Do thorough research, never transfer bitcoin carelessly, and back up your keys somehow. With all the power comes responsibility, and you can send your coins to the dark realm with one mistype. Once you do, they're gone forever. The sidebar is valuable, as is r/bitcoinbeginners
Hope you get into it and join us, and as I always tell people getting into it for the first time: welcome to the fucking show.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:53:40
I do when I can. always buy steam games with btc
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:24:17
I was like 5 minutes too late to move mine off of Gemini, they just now enabled withdrawals and it's not worth shit :(
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:19:10
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:20:36
Holy shit I'm using this
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:53:04
as said below I'm pretty sure it's a countach. and a twin turbo v8 can mean anything from 300 to 1500+ horsepower. turbo throws a whole new wrench in the system.

The ledger checks it's firmware with ledgers website every time you plug it in
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:43:33
yep mine came with a pamphlet about checking for tampering, it also explained why they don't use seals on their boxes. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:45:13
That was my goal back when it was under 1k lol, now I'm just happy to own more than 1
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:53:26
Probably the same as with bch, they'll support whichever chain is more widely adopted. However, I suggest moving your coins off Gemini if you want your airdrops, they just implemented bch withdrawals this week. I'd be much richer had I moved my coins off earlier.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:12:22
You'd need a fucking big oxygen tank to run that 400 horse v12 lol
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:05:28
Everyone I tell just kinda listens and goes "yeah sounds interesting."
Are we those weird obsessed people that people just kinda tolerates and then changes the subject with?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:41:13
I thought I was crushing it having 1.7 at 24, keep it up dude
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:51:08
Couple days ago, check your email or the blog
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:09:43
I was blown away when it hit 90 a while back. I bought at 25 so I'm content selling it all for the airdrop.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:06:30
Never run a node before but I just might for this 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:20:28
I've quintupled, will never sell.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:38:49
No I meant litecoin. My first bitcoin were around 200, and they're long gone
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:20:43
The government provides a substantial amount of goods and services, and them accepting dollars as payment is their "faith" that backs it. Still, at this point we're past the point of bitcoin needing support.
In blockchain we trust.
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:59:39
who that nigga thinking that he frontin on core devs
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:27:26
That is a myth. If it was ever predictable, the pattern would disappear as people fought to game it.
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:56:40
so does it send the entire thing twice or does it know which parts are susceptible to corruption? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:16:01
I'm somewhat familiar with how super low level data exchange works, so this is pretty interesting. I imagine you'd want to re-send larger packets as they are more likely to be missing a piece. But I work with stuff on the binary level, this is way beyond me. thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:03:14
alright, I think I understand. thanks man!
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:18:02
ethereum has a lot to bring to the table, but it's been abused by the enormous pre mine, all the short term boom investors, and the ICO's cashing in. doomed from the start, but I think it will remain in the scene for a while yet. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:37:14
That is a myth. If it was ever predictable, the pattern would disappear as people fought to game it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:36:18
there's a ton of burned bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:00:32
you're gonna have to explain it way more. it sends a seed from which the data can be generated? that's my best understanding of that article. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:49:55
I copied your entire comment and pasted it into Microsoft Edge^tm but it didn't work
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:24:55
yeah Gemini has been working fantastic for me through all this. and they support btc-eth exchanges
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:35:45
ethereum is eating shit from all the ICO's cashing in, too. it's bad timing.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:29:26
I could imagine coming up in the middle of a crowd of screaming kids and just thinking "ABORT ABORT"
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:42:15
that's true, for now
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:36:45
you can exchange between btc, eth, and fiat as much as you like, they put a hold on whatever currency you have until your bank transfer clears.
so even though your money is tied up you can sell and buy as much as you like, and after 3-4 days you can withdraw it. it's nice.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:47:24
like a... blockchain?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:53:34
it's not my fiat I'm worried about it's my crypto. if you put in $500 then buy crypto you have to wait for the transfer to clear before you can withdraw your crypto. that's what I don't like.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:28:15
I think the withdrawal time on a wire is almost a month, or that's what I've read. I like to pull my shit off the exchange asap. even the 2-4 days bugs me.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:47:24
holy fuck lol
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:34:38
I'd try just putting in a different state. I said I was in a different state than I live in and have never had a problem.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:23:19
I'm on the fence of doing that right now. bought eth over the weekend and profited ~50% already, just waiting for the right moment to convert to btc
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:29:36
you're correct. you must deposit money then buy. but I can do it within a couple minutes. I wish they'd lock price though, when it's really going crazy I have to manually adjust the price up a bit or my order won't get fulfilled
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:26:24
I live in Washington and have been using Gemini for a while now. works flawlessly every time.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:30:37
that's one thing I like about eth, for the moment it seems asic-proof, which is better for decentralisation 
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:16:44
well, he has more bitcoin. that's a profit in my book.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:18:09
hmm, now I'm trying to remember what I did. I may have been lucky, I was in Texas for like 6 months and registered while I was there, even though I don't really live there.
