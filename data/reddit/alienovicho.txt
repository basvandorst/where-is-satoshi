I'm not calling it a bubble and we actually called the move higher from August low looking for new highs  . 
Currently it's just a technical area where profit taking can happen .
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:39:38
Bitcoin crashed $300 from the mentioned area ! Technical work always preparing for the next move then news come to accelerate it .
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:41:32
It still can extend higher but this is a risky area where pullbacks are expected to be seen 
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:00:08
Yes usd
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:40:58
This chart is representing a technical view with technical area where some short term cycles are expected to end which means a pullback could happen . No one can predict when the spikes happens and technically the next pullback will also remain a buying opportunity .

These are Elliott Wave Labels used to read the market but it's not used alone. There is other different element included to be able to forecast the path.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:12:22
It's based on a combination of Elliott Wave , Cycles &amp; Distribution system combined with other tools like Fibonacci levels.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:52:11
Why you want it to go that far ! It's currently trading at $3600!
50% of the rally from 07/46 low comes around $2700 so if we see that kind of drop in a corrective structure then it will be another opportunity to buy it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:19:31
It doesn't change as the pullback is expected to happen from 3500 - 3700 before another rally.

I do believe that Bitcoin will remain the King in term of price &amp; value no matter what happens with the rest of the crypto-currency market. Let's take the example off Gold as it maintained it's wealth value over 3000 year despite the discovery of more important metals which are used more frequently in everything. 
So Bitcoin has a similar statue over the rest of crypto-currencies so I'll keep buying &amp; holding till the end ^^

I'm presenting a technical analysis with projected numbers and not shooting things from thin air !
Technical analysis gave me area to buy at $1900 and now first target at $3500 was hit so next extension is at $4200.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:16:52
They do help me as it's part of the system I'm using but everyone has its own way of seeing things. I wrote an article few weeks ego before presenting the Buy area for Bitcoin from $1900  
It not all based on EW but it's language that helps decoding the market.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:58:42
There will always be pullbacks &amp; correction ... that's part of how market works my friend !
Just remember last month dip reached 1850 and now we already hit 4200 .. even better last year in August we saw a dip toward 450 and still here we are :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:11:40
No, I just analyse everything manually , do prepare some scenarios then follow the rules and let the market show me the path.
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:03:31
oh okay np :)
So to start with you need to keep up with which cycle is in progress and the current one is from 07/16 low and as far as that bullish trend-line is holding then can keep extending in an aggressive way until that cycle ends then you can measure the pullback using the Fibonacci retracement tool and find levels to buy it again ( preferably 50% - 61.8 % ). We identify each pullback by the type of pattern it's doing which could help get the entry area defined by the blue box like shown in the picture above. 
There different type of corrective structure take a look here : 
Just tired to explained in simple way for you , so if bitcoin drops from current areas it's will be just a correction against 07/16 low which represents a buying opportunity.

Looool you made my day :D
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:42:49
Yeah i'm high because btc is going higher which make me even more high to reach the extra high level. Highs everywhere so let's get high dude !!
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:30:25
No one can be 100% right about financial forecast but we try the best. We've been waiting for 7500 since August and target is reached so nothing wrong about that. If technical work was none sense how you explain it's been working since 18th century ?
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:11:32
Bitcoin started a technical correction since June and the correction had a target at $7500 was was achieved consequently the bears will take profit there and bulls will step up to buy trying to resume the bullish trend that started December of last year.  
Edit : The technical structure called a double three : [
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:14:11
Which sub is for technical discussion ? I'll delete the post without problem.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:43:59
Well it's totally the opposite way as Technical analysis proved to be right for the last 200 years and especially in the recent decades as new methods have helped to get more accuracy then before.
No one can be right 100% of the time but technical analysis seems to leading any type of news event or movement in the market and if you don't believe that's the case well just don't follow it :)

Everyone has his own opinion and i respect yours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:23:59
I'm only representing my self so i'm not defending the ones who act like you described them.
I'm presenting a technical idea and even it doesn't work it will be still considered as an effort or contribution.

Yes if you loose your wallet address :'(

Bitcoin is correcting the decline from 11/8 peak toward $6700 - $7335 area and while it fails below $7888 peak then it can make another leg lower toward $4650 - $4100 area.

@_date: 2017-11-17 11:22:43
 Made new all time highs and opened another extension higher toward $10450 - $11650 area but in the short term $8600 - $9320 is the next area where 3 waves pullback can happen before resuming the rally

I'm not against Peter Shiff , i'm a Gold lover my self but the picture is so funny as someone suggested it before and now btc at 5K so it was perfect :D

I totally understand how both markets work and I agree with you. Why so serious ? Just relax and have fun .... :D
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:18:15
Actually banks will find a way to use btc in their system and then make people pay for that service. As long they make money then they'll be happy.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:36:54
Last year August correction was a perfect buy opportunity and my order was missed by few points but I bought later on around 500$.
It's the same pattern happening this year so I'm joining the boat one again.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:28:03
It's a technical corrective move preparing for the next leg higher so it's better to be ready to buy it lower !
Chart : 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:49:56
That's how market works when there is a strong trend for example to the upside like Bitcoin did for the last few months then there will be always a boring &amp; frustrating correction move which you can consider as a break for the instrument before it can continue the rally. The correction is identified by the subdivision of its structure using [Elliott wave](  , but the problem is that you can't know if the correction is really over or it'll still extend until the next rally starts for real which is the tricky part and that's why you need to have a system that let's join the trend whenever a correction happen and allow you to protect your position after the first bounce.
You need to understand the market cycles and how the sequence works which will make your trading easier. Because Indicators will only tell you what's already happened in the chart as they are lagging the price so to be able to use them you need to have an edge over the market.
I don't wana make it too complicated for you but a simpler answer would be that I only use for example RSI to confirm new cycles has started but not for trading purpose. Everyone has his own system that suits him best.
Edit : Fibs are part of the basic technical analysis &amp; you need it to calculate targets.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:06:32
I already bought at $1900 and will add again if it drops to $1600 - $1400
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:34:29
Bitcoin is repeating the same scenario from 2013 - 2015 - 2016 following the same corrective pattern! 
So if you buy every dip in extreme area like the last one during the weekend was at 1900 you can already lock your stop at break-even and forget about it : 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:26:27
Last year around this time, the price was preparing another buying opportunity to come around $450 and back then I was thinking that's still expensive so I only bought few !
Now at $1900 i'm thinking this is cheap enough to start accumulating again !!!
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:22:44
nope .. why ?
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:34:11
Well said !!
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:32:44
It's not based on indicators , this is an elliott wave corrective sequence that happens before the trend resumes, the only problem is that you can't know if the reaction from the inflection area is strong enough to break to new highs or it will be just a bounce like the one in June 15. Here is the [Chart]( back then calling a bounce.
So currently it's the same scenario on a larger scale and there should be a reaction there. If it fails to make new high then there will be an even larger correction coming next.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:27:53
By the time you want to buy it again it will be same price you sold it or higher as the rebound will be faster then a rocket.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:32:27
Well that make sense &amp; I got ur point now ^^
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:58:09
I totally understand that but no one can make that decision for you so either you find a way to protect your bitcoins or you can diversify your investment into other coins because if BTC will rise then be sure the rest will follow.

Even if you are a daily trader you should have a strict money management plan to control your risk and never put your hard earned money in one basket unless your a crazy gambler!
So if you are worried about the 1st of august then don't trade during that period and just wait for the market to settle!

Because that's how the economy work and it's applied to every market since the beginning !

There is no streight lines , there will always be an upside followed by a correction to the downside !
