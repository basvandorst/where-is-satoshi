Hello! You shouldn't download a whole blockchain to operate with your bitcoins. You need only a private key for your address. What problem did you have with light wallet?

Everything that happens in blockchain not connected with the real world. All processes are encapsulated there. From this, we've two terms: on-chain and off-chain.
On-chain - it's an everything that happens in blockchain(transactions, smart-contracts).
Off-chain - everything that happens beyond blockchain, for example, the Internet is a part of the off-chain side.

I don't talk about investing, cause I clearly understand that investing is take a lot of time for research and making your own forecasts.
I mean a common opinion that in a crypto world you could make a money from doing nothing and quickly.
