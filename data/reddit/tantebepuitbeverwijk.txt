Why? Installing a wallet just programmes a lot of 0's and 1's on and off. The material of the hard drive doesn't increase with that. So the weight stays the same.

You take your hard drive and weigh it. Put a btc on it. Take hard drive and weigh again. 
Spoiler: the digital world is the only place where more of something weighs the same.

Yes the ATH was one big tether scam and the downfall after is all because of CME futures. Where is my tinfoil hat.

JP Morgan is quite busy with talking about crypto nowadays? Why al this effort?
Maybe JP Morgan didn't say anything and someone wants to create some selling pressure.
