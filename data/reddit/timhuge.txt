I'll quote [myself]( here:
I want to explain why loans for investment don't work when deflation is too high. (Or else, I want help understanding what I'm missing.)
Suppose that, in the far future when everything calms down, the bitcoin deflation rate is 10% in terms of real goods (next year you'll be able to buy 10% more stuff with 1 bitcoin, with a high degree of certainty, and everyone knows that.) Now say someone offers you a loan in bitcoins with the best possible interest rate, 0%. They'll give you 100 bitcoins now and all you have to do is pay back the same amount, 100 bitcoins, in 1 year.
You are considering using the loan to make a productive investment - to purchase a machine that allows you to increase the amount of chips you can produce (say 9 bitcoins worth, for a sure 9% return on investment). At the end of the year, you could sell the machine to pay back the loan, but wait! Even if the machine is still good as new after a year of use, its value in bitcoins will have dropped 10% - you could only get 90 bitcoins for it. So at the end of the year, you'd have the 90 bitcoins from selling back the machine plus the 9 bitcoins from extra chip production, but that still wouldn't be enough to pay back the 100 bitcoin loan. So you don't take the loan and don't make the investment (unless you can find alternate financing).
(If you just kept the 100 bitcoins the whole year, then you would be able to pay the loan back just fine. But then what's the point of taking out the loan if you're not going to use the bitcoins for something?)

My thoughts on the Economist article are [here]( The unfortunate thing is that Bitcoin enthusiasts see it as a "defense" rather than pointing to a need.
Thank you for directing me to that roadmap for Bitcoin post. I'm glad to see that discussion happening more explicitly. I just don't see how it gets to step 5 ($25 billion market cap) without the volatility abating.
Keep in mind that the competing digital currencies future you envision implies huge volatility for Bitcoin as relative currency shares fluctuate. I predict it will be overtaken by [alternatives that get the supply elasticity right](

I fear that this encapsulates the dominant thinking on the economics of Bitcoin among enthusiasts. I would paraphrase it as: Bitcoin is an elegant solution to a math/c.s. problem ... the market ... Bitcoin becomes a functioning currency. Any criticism of the black box in the middle of the argument is dismissed if it does not demonstrate clear comprehension of the mathematical problem Bitcoin solves.
Anyway, can you explain more about how "the largest market for that solution" is determined, or what that means for the USD exchange rate? For instance, what is the largest market for pi? What is the largest market for the solution to Fermat's Last Theorem?

1a) How will Bitcoins stabilize? Specifically:
  i) Having more Bitcoin merchants will only help to anchor prices if they actually quote fixed prices in bitcoins (e.g. like Gavin's salary, not like BitPay).   
 
  ii) Even if they do start quoting prices in bitcoins, it's too easy to change prices in a digital currency. The clunkiness of traditional currencies is part of what keeps their prices stable: printed prices on restaurant menus, etc.
  iii) Opinions are divided on whether more/higher frequency trading stabilizes or destabilizes prices. I haven't seen either argument fleshed out explicitly.
  iv) Then there is the vexing problem that, throughout the adoption process and beyond, any time the demand for Bitcoin rises (due to more merchants, say), the price of Bitcoins rises with it, potentially destabilizing prices.

To be clear, I wasn't saying it was your fault I am lost - I just *lost* my train of thought.
Well, that's a broader question: can it ever be immoral to buy or sell something. No: if both sides of the exchange are equally informed and equally understand. Yes: if there is some asymmetry, as in the case of outright fraud.
In this case, Manjoo believes himself to be more intelligent than many traders in this particular market, who place a much higher probability than him that bitcoins will maintain a $300+ value long run. My case is that it can therefore be immoral for him to sell to them.

On point number 2, let's focus on [2a](


In choosing investments, people weigh three factors: expected return, volatility/risk, and whether the investment advances their values. Haven't the events of the past few days shaken confidence in all three of these for Bitcoin? It's possible that Bitcoin will give you a 900% annual return on a $100 investment (i.e. raising to $1000 in a year), but if the chance of that happening is less than 10% (and the price otherwise goes to &lt; $10), your expected return would be better in a savings account, without even adjusting for risk. It's also not going to change the world if it's fading away in a year.
Undoubtedly, many will continue to hold/buy Bitcoin because of their own beliefs about it. The question is whether that number of people is large enough (or will grow enough) for Bitcoin to work in the way you are envisioning.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:14:56
Thanks so much! Yes, I don't recall if I responded to you previously.
So, it's true that loans can still finance projects with 10% (and riskless!) or greater returns. I just don't understand why you don't want the investments with 0-10% returns.

I've read some accounts of people borrowing money to purchase bitcoins. If this kind of leveraging is prevalent, it may be evidence that Bitcoin is experiencing a bubble.
Interestingly, one of the primary critiques of the Fed is that easy money policies cause "malinvestment" and/or tend to inflate asset bubbles.

Or is the irony that Bitcoin is itself an example of the sort of bubble that its proponents deplore? Discuss.

That's not quite right. You have to take into account the amount of times a bitcoin changes hands each day. You are assuming a "velocity" of exactly 1. For that, you have to imagine that at the start of the day, everyone has exactly the amount of bitcoins they need for their purchases that day, say $50 for me. Throughout the day, I spend all of my $50, not saving any of it for the next day. Those who receive my bitcoins in exchange cannot spend them again until the following day (at which point they must spend all of them, again).
In other words, if people are saving bitcoins more than one day on average, the demand for bitcoins would be higher than $160b. If people are saving bitcoins less than one day on average, the demand would be less than $160b.
And if, on average, people want to spend bitcoins more frequently at some times, days, or seasons, demand for bitcoins will be lower during those times (and there will be inflation).

This is very helpful - a coherent vision of a stable endpoint for Bitcoin. It would take some number crunching, but under the assumption of a one currency world only using Bitcoin, we can estimate the price of a tomato or whatever in BTC in whatever year this begins (say 2030 for purposes of discussion). And I agree that prices could be relatively stable in such a world, and the flexibility of digital prices could only help in fulfilling the role of money as a unit of account: communicating relative prices accurately.
In this vision, the macroeconomic questions about deflation come to the fore, but let's set those aside as really a separate discussion.
Two questions then, sticking with your idea of working backwards:
1. What prevents new crypto-currencies from competing with Bitcoin (and thus causing major price swings as the proportion of the economy using bitcoins for exchange varies)?
2. What will cause the "semi-stability" that you posit as a transition stage before the takeover of all currencies? Presumably, at that time, some will be confident that Bitcoin will become the single global currency and some will be doubtful. Won't prices swing dramatically as events and debates sway opinions back and forth?

Let me start be thanking you for your detailed answer. This is the kind of thinking together that can lead to greater understanding. But I do have trouble following your arguments for 


Despite the problems with volatility?


What do you mean by "monetary base"? I'm assuming you mean increased volume of transactions for real goods.


Here is where you beg the question. [How exactly will more transactions decrease volatility?](


[I did this]( but I don't see a constant growth rate (that is, a constant slope in the log graph). Just eyeballing annual trend lines, from Aug. 2010 to Aug. 2011, it doubles every 1.5 months (~47% monthly), from Aug. 2011 to Aug. 2012 it is constant (~0% monthly), and from Aug. 2012 to now it doubles every 2.5 months (~28% monthly growth). Where is this steady exponential growth? Would you venture a growth rate for the next year (and be specific about the starting point)?
My point is that trading based on wild-ass guesses = huge volatility.


Would you measure the exchange volume in BTC or USD? How much BTC would a person need to own to be counted as using it as a store of value? Ok, now I've summed those two numbers together in 2015. How do I know if I can expect the bitcoin prices of goods to be stable?

1b) When exactly will Bitcoins stabilize, and what will determine the price then?
If we knew [the exchange rate would be $1000 at a specific date]( the rest would fall into place. But we don't. So sketch out a rough estimate - if we can't agree on what a reasonable price schedule would be, how can we expect it to just happen?
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:41:32
Just to expand on this earlier point:


There's a continuum between the sqrt function I proposed for discussion and Bitcoin as I understand it, which is sort of like M(n) = (N(t))/n so that the total number of bitcoins is always awarded regardless of how many miners participate. For instance, you could have M(n) = (N(t)/n)^0.99, which is pretty close to Bitcoin, except for a very slight change in the number of bitcoins created each block. That 0.99 could be anything between 0 and 1 to balance the tradeoff between price stability and resistance to attack..

2a) If Bitcoin prices remain volatile indefinitely, who will want to hold them? People often jump to how BitPay isolates merchants from currency risk, but that only pushes the problem back one step. Either BitPay will have to be willing to hold a bunch of Bitcoins, or others who effectively provide insurance through derivatives will have to take the risk on.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:58:23

The discussion about deflation often gets sidetracked into a discussion about hoarding that is mostly beside the point. Look, it doesn't make sense logically for there to be a currency that predictably deflates 5% or more annually without volatility - everyone would want to invest in it, but then the price wouldn't be steady anymore! No, the problem is the volatility caused by the inelasticity of Bitcoin supply (i.e. it cannot respond to changes in demand), which is why I've focused on that in my questions.

But what's needed for Bitcoin to work as a currency (rather than a risky investment) is predictable prices with respect to real goods, and two factors are working against it:
1. It's easier to change prices for a digital currency. The clunkiness of traditional currencies is part of what keeps their prices stable: printed prices on restaurant menus, etc. What prices are truly fixed in BTC units over a period of time (other than Gavin's salary)?
2. The inevitable deflation means that the simplest form of  predictable prices - constant prices - is not possible in the long run. Maybe a currency with steady deflation can still work, but it will be more difficult to maintain predictable prices.

The beauty of the math is that the reward never goes zero or negative. In fact, the expected value of the reward is always going to be equal to the cost of computation.
To be clear, the transaction fees reward the miners when bitcoins aren't created to help reward them. (In my understanding, this is also what will happen with Bitcoin in 2021 or whenever new bitcoins stop being created - miners will be compensated exclusively by transaction fees then.)
For example, suppose the value of BT2 is currently inflated 10% (despite the automatic stabilization), so c = 1.1 BT2. Then 21% fewer than the target miners will mine (N(t)/1.21). The expected compensation to each miner will then be M(N(t)/1.21) = sqrt(1.21) = 1.1 = c, so the miners are willing to do it.
Ok, but even though the reward never goes to 0 or negative, it's true that with this formula, the number of miners willing to mine could go below a critical threshold if inflation got bad enough due to lack of demand. But that is also true of Bitcoin itself - it's obviously possible that the value of BTC could drop so low (with no hope for a rebound) that it will no longer be financially worth it to mine.
In short, I definitely agree that it's necessary to compensate miners sufficiently to make sure the network stays secure. In my scenario, that happens by setting transaction fees (i.e. N(t)) high enough, and it works as long as people are using the currency - both of which are also necessary for Bitcoin to work long term.

What matters is volatility *against the things you want to buy with bitcoins*. Since the prices of those things are generally set (and stable) in USD, the USD exchange rate is a helpful shorthand.
Bitpay insures merchants against currency risk, not consumers. If you obtained 1 BTC five days ago and waited a day before spending it, you would find that the purchasing power dropped by 50% in 24 hours. Then, if there's something you want to buy, you have to decide whether to take the loss or wait for the purchasing power to go back up (without knowing when that will happen, if ever). 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:10:05
(quick note: it's the percentage fluctuations that matter, not the number of dollars the exchange rate fluctuates.)
Thank you for digesting my points and putting them in your own words. It's wonderful to feel understood.
I've been mulling over a proposal for Bitcoin2 that I'll share with you in it's current vague form. The problem is the inelastic currency supply. What if you gave a fixed number of bitcoins for each time the full mining thing is computed (rather than fixing the total number of bitcoins distributed among all miners for each block)? This would make the supply of bitcoins perfectly elastic, pinning it to the cost of computation. Bitcoin prices would still fluctuate with energy prices and there would depreciation against the dollar as computation becomes cheaper, but prices would be much more predictable than today.

Yes, that revenue means you don't have to pay as much in fees.  That's why checking/atm/debit accounts are so much cheaper than the other services I mentioned. 
(In Cyprus, only the portion of deposits over 100,000 euros got the haircut.  Obviously, you are always assuming risks if you deposit more than the government-insured amount (and also some government risk even for the insured amount).  Have you ever had more than the insured amount in your debit account?)
My analogies are admittedly imperfect.  But it is dumb to whine about having to pay for a service you use.  I can understand complaining that the fees are too high if there is monopoly power involved, but complaining that there are fees at all is teenager-style pouting.

I think a stable rate of deflation could work well enough. The volatility caused by the fixed supply is more of a problem. We know this [from the history of money](


Bitcoin is even worse than gold in this respect, because when the price of gold rises, at least people can sell their jewelry and invest more in mining gold - the supply for use as currency is responsive to the price, helping to dampen price swings due to demand shocks. Bitcoin supply, on the other hand, [does not depend at all on the number of miners]( or anything else - it cannot respond.

It's more than a psychological problem. For instance, I buy some bitcoins at $100. Later that day I want to use them to purchase something but the exchange rate has gone down to $95. Do I take the 5% hit or wait for it to go back up (without knowing how long I will have to wait).


But now it's $20 times hundreds of thousands, so there are a lot more drops in the bucket. What you have to argue is that the percentage of bitcoins being used every day will decrease, right? I'm not sure why that would be the case.




The problem is that it's not steady. To be overly generous, I'll let you count it as "on trend" if the price is between 50% of the trend and double the trend. So, since the trend line is roughly at $100 today, anything between $50 and $200 would be inside the trend range - pretty generous, I think. Now notice that the actual price is outside of that huge trend range [more than a third of the time](


That's not a question I'm qualified to answer, but [my concern is that there will be no stable market consensus even with very large trade volumes]( With USD, people have long-term salary contracts and Subway commits to a $5 special for several months. My idea is that it's these kind of things that provide reference points for the value of USD in the short run. There is almost nothing like this in Bitcoin and there will be even less after the past month. Moreover, there's a kind of chicken and egg problem: merchants don't commit to prices in BTC because the exchange rate is so volatile, and the prices are volatile because merchants don't commit to prices in BTC over any length of time (but rather change them minute to minute in almost all cases).

Does it matter that you can't have loans in a currency with too much deflation (even if the deflation is at a steady 10%, say, and perfectly foreseen by all)? Maybe not - but leave that to one side.
But because this point doesn't seem widely understood, I want to explain why loans for investment don't work when deflation is too high. (Or else, I want help understanding what I'm missing.)
Suppose that, in the far future when everything calms down, the bitcoin deflation rate is 10% in terms of real goods (next year you'll be able to buy 10% more stuff with 1 bitcoin, with a high degree of certainty, and everyone knows that.) Now say someone offers you a loan in bitcoins with the best possible interest rate, 0%. They'll give you 100 bitcoins now and all you have to do is pay back the same amount, 100 bitcoins, in 1 year. 
You are considering using the loan to make a productive investment - to purchase a machine that allows you to increase the amount of chips you can produce (say 9 bitcoins worth, for a sure 9% return on investment). At the end of the year, you could sell the machine to pay back the loan, but wait! Even if the machine is still good as new after a year of use, its value in bitcoins will have dropped 10% - you could only get 90 bitcoins for it. So at the end of the year, you'd have the 90 bitcoins from selling back the machine plus the 9 bitcoins from extra chip production, but that still wouldn't be enough to pay back the 100 bitcoin loan. So you don't take the loan and don't make the investment (unless you can find alternate financing).
(If you just kept the 100 bitcoins the whole year, then you would be able to pay the loan back just fine. But then what's the point of taking out the loan if you're not going to use the bitcoins for something?)

This is one of my favorite answers. But then shouldn't we use an estimate of demand from these categories to estimate a sensible market cap?


This is the point - both Japan and the U.S. are in prolonged slumps right now because their monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound. Most economists agree that a low but positive rate of inflation (definitely not deflation) is helpful for avoiding prolonged recessions:

Scenario 2 more prone to famine.
But nothing I'm proposing will fix the relative prices of goods and services. The analogy fails because there's no intrinsic demand for Bitcoin. If its price is fixed, there is no Bitcoin famine.

This a key idea so let's make sure we get it clear. Lending at a negative 5% interest rate is like giving someone 100B today and asking them to give back 95B in a year. As a lender, I can always do better by just keeping the 100B safe somewhere during the year. Then I get the full 100B back at the end of the year. No matter how prices and exchange rates have changed over the course of the year, having 100B at the end of the year is always better than having only 95B. Am I missing anything?

I would have guessed the opposite. With a stock, you know basically what you're trying the estimate: the present discounted value of future dividends. My sense is that most people here don't have a coherent idea of the fundamentals of bitcoin - how it depends on the volume of goods traded, money velocity, etc. [(And I'm not even sure Bitcoin *has* a fundamental value.)](
Leaving all that aside, the basic point is this: it's fundamentally ridiculous to ask in a public forum [the question that is so common here]( "will the price go up this week?" If everyone knew that, it wouldn't happen because people would be buying now and driving the price down.

You're too kind.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:55:38
If you said anything other than "the price will go up over time," I missed it. In your account, we can't say something like "if volume goes up 1000% from what it is today, the price will go up 1000% from what it is today." 
The problem is that you said "I'd expect the price of btc to forerun volume," a sensible thing to say. But that means we don't know how much it is currently forerunning volume, so we don't know how much the price still has to go up as volume increases.
If it's true that no one knows any more than you say here about what price would make sense, the price will remain unanchored indefinitely. So how is this part of an argument that the price will stabilize?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:31

It's not a model. It's a simplified example. 


Today, they would only do that if the net return is greater than ~3%. If USD were deflating by 5% right now, they would only do that if the net return were greater than ~8%. You can make an argument that that would be better, but let's not confuse the issues.

But Bitcoin will succeed over USD, etc.? Remember, Bitcoin is not Facebook in this analogy. In the world of currencies currently, it's not even Google, it's Socl. In the world of digital currencies, it is Friendster or, at most, MySpace.
To be more concrete, think of the advantages/disadvantages of Bitcoin vs. USD. Now think of the advantages over Bitcoin of [a digital currency that self-regulates prices]( - people buy in by purchasing new units rather than by bidding up current units and sending prices spiraling. It also enables transactions to be confirmed within seconds rather than several minutes. The question is whether those advantages (plus others I haven't thought of) over Bitcoin are larger or smaller than Bitcoin's net advantages over USD.


If I had some, I would so tip you bitcoin for this numerical example. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

But there also may be more and bigger "whales." For example, if the market cap rises, then people (or corporations) could use it to make larger money transfers or launder larger amounts of money. And the deeper cause of volatility, no anchoring of prices by either price setting stickiness or monetary policy, will be unchanged.

I'm not sure this can make sense. The market interest rate balances out the demand for saving and the demand for investment. The problem is that deflation puts a positive price floor on the real interest rate, potentially preventing the market for loanable funds from clearing, leading to excess savings with no investment opportunities for it to go into.

How is the antifragile strategy different from buying lottery tickets or playing slot machines?
I was just making up the 900% number as an example. It's equivalent to  a scratch-off lotto ticket that costs $1 with a 10% chance of winning $10: your average gain over lots and lots of tickets would be $0. But they always tilt the odds slightly against you: only a 9% chance of $10, say. I'm wondering if buying Bitcoin right now is like that.

@_date: 2013-04-14 14:25:18
Sorry, my previous reply was not helpful. I should just ask: what did you mean when you said "at least tulips are finite"?
Two points about divisibility that may or may not be relevant to what you were trying to say:
1. The supply of bitcoins is finite in the sense that the supply is fixed and perfectly inelastic with respect to price. This is the critical flaw in the design. Whenever demand for bitcoin goes up or down, the prices of everything must change. There's not even a supply response from increased mining as there is in the case of gold and silver (or oil). (As an aside, it may be worth considering a variant in which increased mining does increase the growth rate of bitcoins to help dampen price swings.) So, the divisibility means huge deflation is technically manageable but it doesn't address the economic problems with fixed supply and price volatility.
2. I suspect the ease of infinite divisibility (assuming the "infinite" part is accurate) aspect actually make it hard to determine a sensible price. If there were discrete units and you needed at least one unit to make an exchange, that would kind of put a floor on the price of the least valuable things traded with bitcoin. But we don't have that, and the prospect of infinite hyperdeflation will always be there contributing to price volatility. (The prospect of deflation makes people want to hold bitcoins and maybe that's ok. The volatility is the problem - that you don't want to spend your bitcoins when the exchange price is down from the trend..)
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:37:30
So you'd agree it's less volatile than 2 years ago but more volatile than 1 year ago? 
Here's an analogy: the US economy has been less volatile over the past 5 years than it was 80 years ago. So...did recent media coverage fool Taleb into thinking there was a huge crash in 2008-2009?


I wasn't aware of this. Is there a chart elsewhere that does show that flash crash?
All this is to say that I concede your point that Bitcoin was more volatile 2 years ago. (:
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:17:07
Yes, if there is hyper-inflation in the dollar. Has been predicted for four years and no sign of it. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but I just don't think it will.
The fundamental misunderstanding of the hyper-inflation predictions is that money demand matters as well as money supply. (This is a misunderstanding shared by the Bitcoin designers.)
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:59:13
Thanks! I think futures could help somewhat, but as it is a form of insurance, using them will effectively be an additional cost - the higher volatility the higher that cost. 
From my perspective, the most urgent need is for a system to stabilize the price swings that result from demand shocks, but that seems unlikely to happen because Bitcoin is led by people philosophically opposed to such. As [The Economist put it](


What concerns me is that Bitcoin insiders show no interest in this, and their window of opportunity may be limited.

If that's how you want to put it. I certainly do need you to explain to me why it's better to *not* have a stable unit of account. It's my understanding that such a thing actually helps the price system work. Basically changes in relative prices are easier to perceive when average prices are stable as a whole - so prices can better reflect demand for goods and services.

No one knows what's a high and what's a low until afterwards. They can only look back and see how much it has gone up and down in the past.
I buy some bitcoins at $200. Later that day I want to use them to purchase something but the exchange rate has gone down to $150. Do I take the 25% hit or wait for it to go back up (without knowing how long I will have to wait)? A week later, I remember this unpleasant experience and find another way to make my purchase.
But I agree that there is a lower level of volatility which consumers would not notice as much - or which they are willing to put up with for the advantages of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:19:39
1c) Exactly how stable do you envision Bitcoin prices being? 
  i) The much discussed inevitable deflation (though some handwave about how fractional reserve banking or something will avoid this - please point me to a detailed explanation) means that the simplest form of stable, predictable prices - constant prices - is not possible in the long run.
  ii) Has there ever been a currency that is stable at even 1% weekly inflation? Not even close. So what reason do have to think that a steadily deflating currency can do so smoothly?

@_date: 2013-04-14 17:38:11
Yes, markets facilitate price discovery. It doesn't follow that all markets stabilize.
The problem here is that demand for bitcoins is itself not stable. One way to put this is that there are likely multiple equilibria. People do not have an inherent willingness to pay for 1 BTC that is part of their "preferences." It depends on what you can buy for 1 BTC, which depends on how much other people are willing to pay for 1 BTC. There's nothing to anchor the demand - no fundamentals in the sense of dividends. And [the factors that tend to stabilize the prices of normal currencies are not operative](
We do have a rough sense that bitcoin prices should change according to the rate of growth of purchases in bitcoin (assuming that velocity, the frequency with which bitcoins are used, remains the same in the medium-run), but where should that rate of growth start from? We don't have a [initial value](
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:01:03
People who only imagine two outcomes for Bitcoin (0 or global currency hegemony) are narrow-minded. I can imagine an indefinite limbo-like state where true believers teach their descendants to keep Bitcoin going down through the generations to spite Felix Salmon (but it never really catches on with people who don't see how evil USD is). In this scenario, prices of goods in terms of BTC are volatile forever, maybe even increasingly volatile in ever wilder swings of tribal hope and despondency.

This is an idea I think it is fair to attribute [to Matthew Yglesias]( When the Bitcoin prices are stable over a period of time, maybe more people start to believe it can work as a stable currency. Then demand for Bitcoins increases, destabilizing its prices (perhaps setting in motion a bubble-crash scenario), preventing it from functioning as a stable currency!

Is it immoral to buy higher than what you think it should be? Because Manjoo also did that.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:32:36
First, pick a price level - for simplicity, let's say 1 B2C = the cost of calculating a block (energy + computer depreciation) - or whatever computational unit makes sense, like a transaction? (In practice, you may want to have this price level change over time in a predetermined and unchangeable way designed to counterbalance Moore's law - and you'd still have the volatility of energy prices, but leave all that aside for now.)
You want to set up the incentives so that their are sufficient miners for distributed block verification. For 't' transactions, call that number of miners N(t). Set the transaction fees so that the total is N(t) B2C's. Now, say each miner gets a bounty of M(n), which depends on the total number of miners 'n'. Now, set M(n) = sqrt(N(t)/n). 
Let 'c' B2C's be the current cost of performing the computational unit. Then the incentives are such that n* miners will participate in that round, where c = sqrt(N(t)/n*) - so n* = N(t)/c^2. 
Now what happens if 'c' is less than 1 B2C (which means bitcoins have deflated, that is, the USD price of B2C has risen above the target)? Then the total bitcoins given to miners for that block (n*)sqrt(N(t)/n*) = N(t)/c  is greater than N(t), the transaction fees, so new bitcoins are created, which pushes the price of B2C back towards the target.
The opposite thing happens (the bitcoin supply is decreased) if 'c' is currently greater than 1 B2C. And if 'c' = 1 B2C, bitcoins are neither created nor destroyed.
(There's nothing special about the square root function for M(n). I think it just needs to be something strictly concave - the exact shape should be fine-tuned.)
Now, have I misunderstood how bitcoin works so much that this doesn't make any sense? Or is there some other obstacle to it working this way?
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:17:12
Well, it's hard to speculate about Satoshi - I did find [one instance of him commenting on the economics so far]( I would say he sounds economically literate, but he doesn't acknowledge the reality that the huge demand volatility of a complementary currency implies huge price volatility.
I'll agree with you in this sense - both the deflationary expectations and the huge price swings worked amazingly well to attract early adopters and increase awareness of the potential crypto-currency. If we use those as the metrics to judge Bitcoin, then yes, the incentives were ingenious.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:49:04


Repeating this doesn't make it true. Why isn't it more stable now than it was [a year ago]( I agree [more robust exchanges might help]( though.


Isn't agreeing on a reasonable price range helpful for price stability?

@_date: 2013-04-15 15:15:03
The supplies of fiat currencies and the workings of the exchanges are *not* the root causes, and that's the point. The root problem is the deliberate design of Bitcoin to have a fixed supply. (If people want to buy twice as much stuff with bitcoins next month as they do this month - the purchasing power of bitcoins must double, other things equal.) I haven't worked out the details, but it is in principle possible to set up the mining rewards such that the price of a bitcoin is [anchored to the cost of computation in some way]( The supply of bitcoins would then adjust with demand rather than prices adjusting with demand.

That's because you can buy everything you want in USD. Also, most people may not interact with the USD exchange rate, but they would sure notice if the USD inflation rate rose significantly. Talk to someone who has lived through hyperinflation in their country - there are lots of them on reddit.

This question doesn't apply to you then. I'm only posing it to people planning to cash out in the event of a crash.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:00:45
How does a crash stabilize the price?
Here's the most fundamental issue you left out:
5. There is a chicken and egg problem with lots of vendors using bitcoins and stable prices. Right now, we've got neither. If a bunch of new vendors did adopt, it would send the price soaring. If no one knows what the stable price level/range is, there is no hope for a stable price.

Yeah, I should have just said "crashes," not "crashes to 0."

Well, it is much worse for Bitcoin than for gold or silver because, while those came into use as currency over thousands of years, Bitcoin is intended to do so in a decade at most. And what on earth do you have in mind with that parenthetical?


I totally agreed that Krugman overstates things. He revels in his role as a polemicist, for better or worse. But you will find even more hubris among prominent bitcoin proponents like Jon Matonis.

[It's the volatility that's the problem]( - there will never be relatively steady prices with slow, steady deflation.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:39:25
Then what explains the changes in relative price between gold and silver, for instance? Or, why is the price of gold in USD fluctuating more than the average price of other goods?
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:08:39
It's a general point about asset pricing, actually... Oh, nevermind.

Is it more than a year old? Reputation? Other reason to be sure they won't run away with money?

Either I wasn't clear, or this is Poe's law. I'm not willing to talk at this level of generality any further.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:03:11
That could counteract the price of bitcoins from rising, but won't it cause the price of bitcoins to actually fall lower and lower as new cryptocurrencies are introduced? What will make prices tend to stabilize?
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:43:13
Yeah, it's been a humbling experience. (:
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:08:32
Yes, this is the quintessential defense of Bitcoin - it argues volatility doesn't matter *and* quickly hedges that by saying the volatility will go away in the fullness of time. The two unsupported claims bolster each other in a kind of circular logic, but you make no attempt to defend either point in detail.


Ok, now address my questions [2a]( and [2b](


Ok, how do we get to a thriving non stock market (without addressing 2a and 2b). In particular, [1a](

For the record, my hasty title is unfair. While he is certainly saying he doesn't recommend buying Bitcoin right now, his tweets don't really retract in any way [his statement]( that "Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative."

A stable increase more than 7% a year or so is logically impossible. If it was going to increase by 20% a year and everyone knew that, they would move all their money from savings deposits etc to bitcoin, thus wildly destabilizing the price. A steady increase of 3% or so is possible, but it depends on the knife edge condition that demand for bitcoin's various uses increase precisely in tandem with the supply.
