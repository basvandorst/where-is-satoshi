There need not be only 10 masternodes, there is a list and it is worked down. The DDoS attack you describe would require a very large percentage of the MN network to be DDoD'd or compromised to succeed. And it's no 'claim' about the number of MNs - you can verify it for yourself, as can anyone else.

You are wrong. I'm a python coder, not c++, and I found it in under a minute:

A nasternode is 'created' by having a 1000DRK vin to the wallet and adding 3 lines to the .conf file. What else are you talking about?

For each transaction lock, a random subset of 10 Masternodes are chosen from the total. Do the math - the odds of an attacker getting the right ten are laughably small unless they control the vast majority of Masternodes.
And a *different* set of ten are chosen for every single transaction.
I'm not sure what your point is about notaries - they are still entities that you have to place your trust in. Plus, DRK does multisig exactly like BTC anyway. InstanX means you don't have to faff about with such things. It takes a lot more that 20 seconds to set up a multisig deal and coordinate all the parties.
Miners can't 'ignore' Masternode consensus - their blocks will just get orphaned.

Bitcoin has its place, but attempting to do anything covert with it is ludicrous. It's an open book, and some dodgy mixing site isn't going to fix that. Use Darkcoin, keep your business your own.

Darksend source will be released on the 29th. Everything else (Masternodes etc) is already open source. Expecting the source code for a whitepaper published earlier today is a little impatient.

Darksend+ is to coinjoin what the Tesla Model S is to the Ford Model T... ;)
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:42:06
 - you'll notice some additional code to the Bitcoin main.cpp... ;)

Whatever the inputs, they are all locked for however many blocks you specify when you hit the send button (default is 6). You *can't* doublespend any of them. The 10 Masternodes form consensus on the lock and push it to the rest of the network. Those inputs are locked, period, for x blocks.
You should read the paper that Evan posted - it explains how it works, and answers all your questions.

The monero devs are also so inept that after 6 months they still haven't  figured out how to produce a simple GUI to their bloatchain.

Bitpay and Coinbase charge money for their services. As a business owner, why would I want to pay them a cut of my profits when a free solution exists?
Really, calling a network of 1000 masternodes centralised while saying the problem is solved by *two* providers is rather odd. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:23:35
A few nodes selected randomly each time from nearly a thousand currently, yes.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:58:39
That won't solve anything. Due to, you know, the blockchain being a public ledger and all...
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:49:49
Plus there's the Darkwallet being a centralised browser plugin issue... 
Darkcoin's trustless mixing, as well as solving the issues mentioned, happens across a distributed platform of currently nearly two thousand Masternodes, with each one in the mixing sequence chosen at random from the total.
Use the right tool for the job. For anonymity/privacy, Bitcoin isn't it.

I'm not sure how you are reading functions out of a binary, but if you ask Evan (evan82 on reddit, eduffield on BCT and darkcointalk.org ) I'm sure he can assist. Beleive it or not we actively welcome people pointing out flaws and holes, which is why everything currently in production will be open-sourced on the 29th and why Kristov's audit was comissioned. You are absolutely welcome to pick it apart and tell us about any flaws, we want to hear it, more eyes lead to more secure code.
