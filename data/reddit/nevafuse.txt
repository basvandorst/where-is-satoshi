Assuming the fees are about on par w/ the one in Vancouver (6%), it is mostly for novelty right now.  But no reason they can't drop the percentage once they paid off the machine.  
Even 3% would be cheap enough for someone to save money if they wanted to send cash quickly to someone else.  Western Union's fees are 6-12%, so 3% each way would be on par w/ their best rate &amp; half their worst rate.
Also good for arbitrage across different exchanges since it is instant as long as the price difference is greater than the fee.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:50:28
For perspective, there's a Western Union nearby that charges 11-100% (i'm not kidding) for amounts under $200 to send cash to the US.  Assuming you could find another ATM to withdrawal for 5%, you'd save at least 1% for amounts under $200.

There's a much higher risk of this happening when the transactions are small, quick &amp; anonymous.  Right now bitcoin isn't popular enough to be anonymous in person.  And most bitcoin users don't want to bite the hand that feeds them.
Once bitcoin is more anonymous in person, the miners will have more similar rules making the longer you wait to double spend, the less likely it will work.  Even waiting for a vending machine to grab your item will be enough time for a double spend to be detected or too unlikely to work.

Agreed.  The one hour confirmation time is the point when reversing a transaction becomes extremely difficult.  This time period is the same for all similar cryptocurrencies.  Block frequency is manipulated by making the mining process easier or harder.  If the block frequency is 4x more often, it is 4x easier, &amp; will take 4x the number of blocks to reach the same confidence level.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:09:53
I'd argue it's a soft fork right now because blocks currently never hit that limit.  It could be eliminated in the next release &amp; by the time we hit that limit most miners will have upgraded.

That $45 per transaction was pulled from blockchain.info stats page.
I didn't mean the price was falling.  I just meant the price would be rising faster if 25 more coins weren't being generated every 10 minutes.  Because supply would be lower.
Preming requires you to give away your money or it won't be popular enough for the price to rise.  So I'd argue it can be more even distributed than the mining reward model.  Which would make it hard to "pump &amp; dump" because the founders wouldn't have an unequal share.  If satoshi unloaded, bitcoin price would plummet because he owns a huge amount of coins.
All that being said, it's still very early for cryptocurrencies &amp; I think there's only room for one right now.  So I'll still with bitcoin because it is good enough.  But I'd definitely consider switching to an equally popular premined cryptocurrency in the future.

At the very least, sign up for Blockchain.info's wallet &amp; move your coins there.  Make sure you add your email so you get a backup anytime changes are made.  If you are skeptical, just move a few at a time.  
It is by far the easiest &amp; most secure method.  Everything is encrypted client-side so they never store anything but the encrypted wallet.  So if they go down or get hacked, you can import your encrypted wallet into another website/program &amp; go from there without worrying about your coins.
It isn't riskless, but I'd argue it is less risky than hoping Coinbase doesn't turn into the next mtgox.

$45 per transaction includes fees AND the block reward.
The distribution quantity is a huge deal.  I'd argue bitcoin's max limit is one of its most important features.  And a premined coin gets to that limit faster.  Which will prevent your money from losing any value right from the start instead of gradually over 100 years.  Transaction fees will also be unsubsidized from the beginning so you'll find out quickly how well that model works.
I don't have the time/energy to make a quick buck.  I'm long on whether currency I support.  Currently it is bitcoin, but I'd have to put some serious thought into a popular premined variant.
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:00:37
That isn't fast enough.  Satoshi misjudged how quickly bitcoin would rise in popularity.  The block reward is an insane $15k every 10 minutes.  At an average 400 transactions per block, that's $30 a miner receives for each transaction.  Even western union can be cheaper than that.

According to [about.com]( there are 4 different methods you can use.
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:45:46
I actually prefer the premined method of distribution.  
I don't like how my coins are worth less for every new block that gets generated.  And miners are extremely overpaid - averaging $45 per transaction!  A lot of people are gambling on untested transaction fees replacing the block reward.
In the beginning, bitcoin basically had a premined distribution method.  Only Satoshi &amp; a few others were mining in the beginning.  And they were basically giving away future coins by telling others about mining.  So they actually made more money by telling others &amp; giving away the coins they probably would have ended up mining.  
The key to premined cryptocoins is to give away as much as possible to as many people as possible.  If you hoard it all, the value will never increase.  You'll make a lot more money by telling others &amp; giving away your stash.  So the distribution model is more natural than bitcoin's arbitrary 4 year halving.

That's a pretty large unproven theory to justify overpaying miners &amp; devaluing your own wealth.  The overpayment also encourages an attack because the attackers will be well rewarded before even attempting to be malicious.  A lot less incentives to reach/stay at 51% if the pay is mediocre.
According to wikipedia, China has the largest supercomputer at ~34 petaFLOPS.  Folding is currently at ~40 petaFLOPS.  That's VOLUNTARY distributed computing vs the backing of the Chinese government.  According to bitcoinwatch, bitcoin is at ~500,000 petaFLOPS.  Now bitcoin miners are paid a little too good, but even if paid more reasonably, we would still be much stronger than the world's largest supercomputer.  That's enough evidence to convince me that a fee based mining network would work fine.

TL;DR There's no difference - just better pay preaching Keynesian "economics."
People like receiving "free" benefits from the government (Cash for clunkers, medicare, Bush's $300 refund check).  The politicians pay for it by creating new money.  The negative effects of creating new money take a while to affect consumer pricing.  Because the effects aren't immediate, it is easy to blame it on something else (CEO pay, war in the middle east, bad weather).  Rising prices make citizens want more "free" stuff from the government.  And the cycle continues.
In addition to citizen support, there's lots of money to be made collecting that new money.  It doesn't take much effort to collude with a politician to become the "winning" bidder.  Why support anything else when you could actually make money from supporting Keynesian economics?
At the end of the day, the people that work for the government benefit the most. The rest of us pay for it w/o much benefit.  Bitcoin prevents governments from abusing the power of inflation.  Governments will be forced to attempt to tax us instead which is a lot harder to do especially with a currency you can move from country to country with without confiscation.  I think I may actually start to see a small flicker of light at the end of the tunnel.

 - Cost Per Transaction (averaged from the past 24 hours)
Apparently we are averaging ~350 transactions per block.  So the math is ($625/btc * 25 BTC) / 350 = $45.  Even at the 4200 limit, it would be $3.70+, not $0.26.  And who knows what the price will be at that limit.  It may be 12x higher, which will put us back at the $45 mark.

Miners are going to create blocks that contain the most amount of legitimate transactions w/o propagating too slowly.

Give it time.  
Retailers need dollars to pay their suppliers so they convert.  Once enough retailers are onboard, suppliers will start accepting it.  Then the retailers will have no reason to convert &amp; will save money because they won't lose the 1% they are paying to coinbase/bitpay.  Once enough suppliers are onboard, it will move onto the next group - employees or who else is next in line.  Eventually everyone will be transacting in bitcoins and there will be no reason to convert.
Don't expect this to happen overnight though.  We still have a long way to go.  Enjoy the ride.

We should change the code to halve the block reward more frequently.
The difficulty has long past the point necessary to protect us.  If anything it is making things worse by increasing the barriers to entry.  A smaller reward will make every coin worth more, decrease the difficulty rate making it easier for competing miners, and shorten the time until we need to rely on transaction fees.

The OP's method doesn't require you to perform the double spend at the same time.  The OP is mostly relying on mining rule differences which means the double-spend could be done several minutes after the original tx as long as the original tx hasn't been included in a block yet.  In other words, the customer could have left the store already.  Regardless, if the customer visits a lot or wants bitcoin to do well, it wouldn't be in their best interest to do this.  And eventually the mining rules will get normalized so it'll be harder to exploit that vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:57:11
Remove the block reward.  It'll make everyone's coins more valuable &amp; force the miners to accept as many transactions as possible so they can collect the highest amount of transaction fees.  If we need more coins, we can just add another zero after the decimal point.

The OP is taking advantage of the rules different miners implement to increase their odds of a successful double-spend.  These rules will normalize over time.  
By the time bitcoin customers are popular enough to blend in with other customers, the success of a double-spend will depend on how quickly it is done after the original tx.  You'd probably have to do it at the same time as the original tx to have a fighting chance &amp; a merchant will easily be able to detect it.

No.  Your private key is not the password used to encrypt your wallet.  Private keys are long alphanumerics hidden inside your wallet that correspond to each public address you own.  Technically public addresses are one way hashes of your private key.  So the only important piece you need to spend money is the private key.  Wallets are made up of these private keys.  The reason people like to encrypt them is so a virus doesn't grab your wallet &amp; have instant, easy access to your private keys.

Long-term, miners accepting fees below cost will drop out or increase fee minimums (because they are losing money).

Nonsense.  You can test this theory right now.  The limit is rarely hit now so it is as if there is no limit.  Last I read, difficulty is sky rocketing.  
You could argue the block reward is subsidizing this growth which I may agree with, but I'd also argue there would still be plenty of miner competition without a reward or limit.  As long as bitcoin is relevant, there will be people willing to pay the transaction fee minimums to get their transaction processed fast.  If there's a miner willing to accept less, than that collective minimum will drop.  If miners can't afford the current minimum, the collective minimum will rise.  Just like a real market place.  If none of this is working, then obviously people have found a cheaper/better alternative.

I'd like to pay $1/gal for gas.  But no one will sell me a gallon for $1.  Why not?  Because gas stations wouldn't cover expenses if they started selling gas at $1/gal.  Same for miners.  Once rewards are gone, miners won't make any money selling a spot in their block for less than x amount.  Therefore an equilibrium x amount will form just like an equilibrium price of gas per gallon.
Game theory only states that each miner will act in their best interest.  But a miner that continues creating blocks below the market value for a long period of time will be unable to afford the electricity to do so &amp; it will be in their best interest to drop out or raise their minimums.  Once that happens, the minimum will rise back to the equilibrium.  If miners set their minimums too high, other miners will undercut them forcing them to lose out on transaction fees causing minimums to fall.
I predict there will still be people willing to accept zero transaction fees, but their hashrates will be minimal &amp; rarely be able to create blocks.  On the other side, there will be miners with above average transaction minimums that process blocks more frequently because they rake in revenue from high transaction fees.  And there will be people in the middle.  The whole range won't deviate much from equilibrium.

I'm not saying capitalism has to have 0% government involvement/spending.  But at least an average spending percentage lower than the average profit margin (10%).  Obviously the government isn't equally involved in every industry, but I think that would be a good, quick test.

There will always be an incentive to pay transaction fees as long as is cheaper/better than any alternative.  I may not pay the standard minimum fee for transferring money to a friend I owe money to.  But be sure I'll pay possibly even more than the minimum to pay my mortgage or purchase groceries.  And as long as the transaction fee is less than the current alternatives ($25 wire transfer, $8 western union, or 2-3% visa/mastercard), we'll be fine.  Obviously if they are higher than that, then bitcoin was a false hope to start with.

What's wrong with pricing at cost?  An ideal competitive market has no profits.  No need to pay a premium fee for transactions when there are so many people willing to compete for market value.  Costs includes everything required to produce the product including the CEO's base salary (and benefits). The only thing it doesn't include is the CEO's bonus. Pricing at cost is ideal.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:11:44
It is a little different model.  But they will only be able to steal those higher priced transactions for a limited period of time before the market adjusts &amp; people realize blocks are being processed with lower fees.  It'll only take one block to skew the rolling average so the adjustment period will be relatively quick.  But anyone willing to pay all that money for mining equipment isn't going to be playing the short game.  Once in a blue moon someone may scoop up those still valid lower fee transactions if they think it won't affect the rolling average too much &amp; the collective amount is worth the risk.  But it'll be rare.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:59:16
Mostly this answer for now (and the fact that the block reward easily covers mining costs so not much of a need to game the market for greater than zero transaction fees).  Once the block reward stops providing enough revenue to cover mining costs, getting transactions into a block w/o fees will be much more difficult because miners will rely  on the revenue from those transaction fees.  And if they continue accepting transactions with zero fees, they won't be able to afford the costs they incur to mine.  I'm sure there will be some miners that will continue to accept zero-fee transactions, but their hash rates will probably be low &amp; rarely find blocks.

ROI is an inflationary currency concept.  You aren't losing money to inflation so no need to beat it.  Every coin lost, every increase in population, the more value you are gaining.  So having the same salary will actually buy you more over time.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:59:59
Confirming a transaction is not free.  You aren't taking into account electricity, mining equipment, internet costs, etc.  All of that factors into an average fee amount each miner is willing to accept before throwing in the towel.  Obviously there's a decent difference between the costs of gas &amp; the things I mentioned above, but that doesn't make the equation even different, just scaled down.
A miner can't lower the minimum fees they are willing to accept because they won't be able to pay their bills.  If the average fee is truly at the equilibrium, then a miner trying to undercut will not be able to for long because they won't be able to pay their bills.  If the cost of electricity starts to drop then the equilibrium fee will fall because miners will be able to reduce their revenue &amp; still pay their bills.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:52:48
That argument could be made for any product/service.  For the same reasons it doesn't make every gas station, bread, milk, barber shop bankrupt neither will it make miners go bankrupt.  At the end of the day, they have expenses &amp; setting a price too low will bankrupt them.  People will try to undercut but they won't survive unless they have lowered their expenses.

To be fair, as indivisible as inflatable.  In other words, the same hard fork to increase divisibility could also be used to increase the hard limit.  Although I personally hope increasing divisibility would be more popular since it fixes the same problem without diluting everyone's wealth.

1) As others have said blockchain.info - just make sure you back up your wallet to your email once a month or after a large transaction.  Even if the site gets hacked, you'll be fine with a decent enough password.
2) Outside of black market uses, there definitely aren't any huge options here except for maybe high high risk investing.  Given time, growth, &amp; stability, better non black market uses will emerge.
3) In the US, Dwolla + Mtgox will have you trading in the same amount of time it takes any other brokerage - 3-4 business days for fairly cheap $.25+.6%.
4) To be honest, blockchain.info works so well, you don't need to know all the details.  You just log in, send money, get address to give to someone so they can send you money, send a backup to your email.  Doesn't feel much more difficult than online banking to me.  I love the details of bitcoin, but I realize not everyone does.  Do you really know how ACH, FDIC, or the Federal Reserve works?

Since when is a country with socialized healthcare (Medicare, Medicaid), retirement (Social Security), roads, police, fire, etc considered capitalistic?
Regardless, bitcoin has no political affiliations.  It gives you the freedom to do what you want with your money.  If you don't believe the distribution of new Canadian money is socialistic enough, you can attempt to start your own socialistic society.  And the only reason this is easier with bitcoin is because you can store your wealth in your mind instead of a bank where the govt can seize it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:32:56


Canada/US may be more capitalistic than Zimbabwe/Cuba, but it is pretty far from capitalistic IMO. [Canada/US are around 40% govt spending over GPD.](  I think it'd be pretty hard to argue a country with such a high amount of govt spending is mostly privately owned (although I guess technically it is the majority).

Your grandfather?  What about mine?  While my taxes were going to your grandfather, my grandfather could have used that money to pay for things Medicare doesnt cover or better doctors that dont accept Medicare.  Why is your grandfather more deserving than mine of that money?  At the end of the day it isnt greedy businessmen that are paying for him, it is other people probably in the same situation as you.  Wouldn't you rather use your tax dollars to help your own grandfather out instead of giving that to the government to pay for wars &amp; drones?

Marginal cost is near zero (assuming you aren't bumping against any arbitrary size limit nor orphan risk).  But the long-term consequences of accepting transactions at that marginal cost are not worth the short-term gain.  And any miner willing to tempt fate &amp; accept fees below cost will not be able to survive long (nor affect seasoned miners long).

It's difficult to tax bitcoin/cash because it needs to be reported voluntarily.  It's a lot easier for the IRS to rely on bank statements than honesty.
Second, to offset the difference between tax revenue &amp; what they want to spend, governments print money which they can't do with bitcoin.

Profit/Loss is based on revenue but they aren't the same.  You can make 10MM in revenue, but have 0 profit/loss/roi if your expenses (including salary) are 10MM as well.  And having 0 profit is fine because you still get your salary.  The only reason no profit is bad is because that means you're losing money to inflation.  Which is a nonexistent problem for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:42:57
I completely agree.  But the IRS has limited resources.  I'm sure they will beef up some once more people start ditching banks.  But auditing 330MM people is a lot of work.  Combining the inability to create new money with a sharp increase in under reported income will make it even more difficult to acquire more funds for the IRS to hire more auditors.  Eventually the government will run out of money.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:37:27
Return on investment is profit/loss - not revenue.  Miners are in this game to make a salary (included in costs).  As long as they are covering their costs - they are golden. 
If the transaction costs are lower than the alternative exchanges (PayPal, Western Union, etc) &amp; inflation is less than the alternative currencies (US Dollar, Euro, etc), miners should have no problem covering their costs (which includes receiving a salary) &amp; will continue mining.  
If the arbitrary block size limit is not handling correctly, it will cause any unnecessary increase in transaction costs which may cause people to jump ship to another altcoin or former competitor.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:30:51
I don't think you understand the real implications of bitcoin.  Governments make money by taxing and printing new money. Look at countries that don't have access to print their own money - Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus.  Taxation isn't enough.  And even if taxation was enough, cash and bitcoin are difficult to trace.  
I like direct deposit, credit cards, and banking for the convenience despite being super easy for the IRS to know when I'm skipping out on taxes.  But bitcoin is just as convenient plus it is hard to trace.  It'll only be a matter of time for people to decide they would rather keep that 15-35% instead of give it to the IRS.
Once bitcoin gets popular enough, the value of a dollar will plummet.  So even if the government tries to print money to pay for itself it'll be pointless.
So to answer your question, yes, it will make governments more transparent and accountable because large governments won't exists.  Our new government will be larger forms of HOAs.

I thought there was already a consensus on this issue based on a post from Gavin - eliminating any block size limitation.  The idea is that any unusually large block will take too long to propagate &amp; be orphaned.  Large pools can even set custom limits for what they deem too large to accept/propagate.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:02:56
The people in control benefit from inflation because that new money is directly allocated to them via govt contracts.  The people in charge &amp; their wealth wouldn't exist without fiat.  Death of fiat means death to them.  They wouldn't survive in a free market.  None of those people will be backing bitcoin unless they are too dumb to realize that - which is a good possibility. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:05:57
I'm assuming those free coins are in pretty small amounts.  Without paying transaction fees, small amounts can take a while to be confirmed.  And obviously it doesn't make much since for those free services to pay transaction fees since an appropriate fee would probably be more than the amount they are trying to send.  They should be broadcasted immediately though.

It is relatively common in bitcoin to have 1 orphan block  every 12 hours meaning those bitcoins could be double spent if the seller relied on 1 confirmation.  How common is it in litecoin?  My hunch is that it is a lot more frequent due to the shorter interval.  Not sure there's anything to be gained from a shorter interval if you still have to wait an hour.
I dont have anything against alt coins just not seeing anything better about litecoin.  They can attempt to coexist but litecoin may need to differentiate more.

No cost for accepting minimum fee transactions (unless there's a propagation risk from too large a block).  Huge cost from accepting sub par fees because the collective minimum will fall meaning future fees will be too low to cover expenses.  To come up with that minimum will require each miner to calculate transaction size over expenses (electricity, rent, equipment, etc).  The more powerful miners will have a higher minimum due to higher expenses but will not necessarily go bankrupt because their services will be in higher demand from people wanting to get their transactions processed quicker.
Edit: a better minimum calculation will be average block size over average expenses since you never know how many transactions will be available matching your minimum &amp; you're not guaranteed to find the block everytime.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:27:42
Just because there is room for zero/low fee transactions doesn't mean the miner has to include them.  The miner should set a lower bound on acceptable fees that matches their effort &amp; expenses.  Users will then be forced to pay an average minimum fee to get their transactions in the next block.  Miners may be tempted to snag the accumulating sub par fees.  But that will only cause the minimum to temporarily fall until sub par grabbers ditch due to expenses being higher than revenues.
The current limit wasn't created as an incentive for higher fees...it was created for spam prevention.  There's a comment from Satoshi saying it was never meant to stay.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:26:26


Why does everyone assume if the blocksize limit is removed that miner competition will plummet?  We rarely hit the limit now &amp; miner competition is fierce.  Why would removing the limit we never hit be any different?  The answer is it wouldn't.  The limit was only put in place as a precaution in the beginning when there were barely any miners to prevent bad actors from sabotaging the network.  Now that the network is so large, a overly large block will take too long to propagate &amp; be orphaned by a more reasonably sized block.  In other words, the limit has long outlived its usefulness &amp; now is positioned to hurt us.

I personally think [crony capitalism]( much better describes a majority of countries.  And maybe that is the definition Marx had in mind, but capitalism IMO more closely matches the definition [Wikipedia]( gives - an economic system based on private ownership.  And a govt who's spending makes up [40% of the GDP]( is far from privately owned IMO.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:09:49
The dynamic limit is a fine idea if people are really that paranoid about large blocks..  Although I disagree an unlimited block size would be the end of the world.  If a block was unreasonably large, it would have trouble propagating on the network faster than a more reasonably sized block.  This would cause the unreasonably large block to be orphaned forfeiting transaction fee revenue &amp; killing any incentive to try it again.  Thus it would work almost the same way as the dynamic limit without all the fancy code.
@_date: 2013-01-19 16:44:43
The block reward is a necessary evil to distribute the currency as fairly as possible while still stimulating growth.  The ideal situation will take place when the block reward is zero and we rely only on transaction costs.  
The reason transaction costs are low now is because of the block reward.  The block reward is so high that it easily covers the costs of mining.  Therefore miners gladly accept zero fee transactions because the block reward is enough to cover costs &amp; they want to facilitate transactions so bitcoin will be worth more &amp; more every day (which also makes their block reward worth more).  Obviously once the block reward disappears, miners will have to rely on transaction fees.  Then they will start only accepting transactions with enough fees attached to cover their mining costs.  
None of this has anything to do with the client.  The developers have built in a fee system that is really only developed around preventing spam.  In the future, the fee system will be an economy of its own where price fluctuates based on supply &amp; demand of the network.
I look forward to the day when the block reward is minuscule &amp; the miners only rely on transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:04:04
I agree with most of what you've said.  The only thing I don't agree with is the worry that the percentage of miners accepting those lower fees will grow to a threatening level.  Depleting fish in the ocean won't happen during the life of a fisherman's boat, but the affects of accepting too many low fees will be seen before a miners equipment is outdated.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:48:17
I agree it affects the whole network &amp; seasoned miners would temporarily feel the affects.  But it will only be temporary and seasoned miners will be able to weather the storm.  Just like if I opened a new store and tried to steal my competitor's customers by offering prices below cost.  I may have enough reserves to hold out for a little while but eventually I'm going to run out of money or I'm going to drive out the competition so I can up my prices.
