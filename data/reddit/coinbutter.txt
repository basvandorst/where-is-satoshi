100% correct

I generally agree. Also, i don't want any part of a 'fork explosion'. Sounds ugly and pointless and legitimacy -eroding.

Why do you think it's a scam? You could make many legitimate criticisms but I've seen nothing to indicate it's a scam.

I understand the idea, I just don't think that's what's happening.

It's a dissociative pain killer used in hospitals. It is highly dose dependent with different properties coming out at different doses. Habitual use often damages the bladder.

I know a lot about it. I think the main personalities are trying to make it into a worldwide cash currency that steals the name from bitcoin, which the main leaders seem to be totally open about. I don't think it's a scam against BCH investors. Do you have a source?

To put this in context, the market cap of the S&amp;P 500 is $23 trillion today. I'm no billionaire, but if crypto ever gets to $20 trillion, the investment landscape will not remotely resemble its current form.

Peter Schiff is a straight clown. He's a gold salesman who has predicted 25 of the past 2 recessions.

Looks like he's selling acid. 
In all seriousness, how would this possibly be used? Do you just walk around bartering with people? Also, his understanding of what gives money value is absolutely infantile. He's either stupid (totally possible) or deliberately giving his audience bad information so they'll buy his gold. I imagine he's spoken these specious arguments so many times he's made them true in his mind, even though on some level he knows it's all bullshit. He's just pushing the family business, after all.
