I was looking at doing this with my Beaglebone but haven't really looked.  I got fed up for waiting for the RPi being back ordered for like 3 months so I cancelled it.  What's funny is that I was about to cancel my Jalapeno until I saw pics of it being shipped.  Again, the 3 month mark.

I've told my dad about it as well.  I've only put $160 into it when I ordered a BFL jala.  I've also mined 2.5 btc and got in on a group buy using those btc.  I think once he sees that you can buy products with it, he'll be more interested.  I've explained how it all works but he's not tech savvy.  Took me forever to teach him how to use email.  Like you said though, it's highly volatile but I don't see the difference in going to sit down at a blackjack table.  You can lose that much in a few hours in a casino on a bad run.

At 40% increase for 20gh/s (only spent $500 on it), if I start mining in September, by July 14th of next year, I'd make right at $1000, $500 after breaking even.  If I got everything in August, I'd mine $1600 worth.  Huge difference.  I feel for you because a lot of people are in the same boat.  I'm being optimistic.  I'll probably just end up breaking even.

Well I have a BFL 7 gh/s Jala coming and I got in on and a groupbuy that Steamboat is doing on bitcointalk forums.  I ordered the Jala March 1st of this year at the $150 price point and later upgraded it.  They said 1 month a week shipping wise and they are in September of last year according to Jody's blog on the 17th.  Still looking like a month and a half out.  I'll probably get the group buy that I placed an order for in a month hopefully.
I purchased a BFL late in the game but since they are shipping, I'm holding onto the order.  I don't think I'll order another unit from them this year.  2nd gen (Avalon?) chips come out in October (I read that somewhere...) which I'm hoping will reduce power and increase hashing.  A lot of people are more knowledgeable on the subject than me.  I just read a lot to hopefully understand what the hell I'm getting into.
Steamboat has been vouched by several people but I don't know the guy.  He responds to my emails within 6 hours with questions I have because I don't have time to read through 40+ pages of a forum.  It's just a 4.5 gh/s chip/board/heatsink.  You buy the amount of chips you want and pay him to mount it to the boards. 1.375 BTC for 16 chips and another 1.4 for assembling and shipping it looks like.  You have to have a power supply for it.  I'm doing this because this is the only thing I can afford and also, I mined those BTC on my gaming rig.
Terrahash.com just started taking orders yesterday.  I think they are opened to everyone now.  The boards seemed reasonably priced but the over all units seem ridiculously high in price.  It's like $1000 for a case full of fans and a power supply.  I think I could build an open air case for a lot less.  They are operating out of California but as far as I can tell, they don't have a working product yet.  I also don't know their reputation yet.  However, even though they are expensive, they do look nice and you can buy the minimum and continue expansion.  The DX Large can be 72 gh/s for $5100 (I have no idea how fast the turn around time is on that) and the BFL has a 50gh/s for $2500 (you'd probably get that 6 months from now due to their track record).

@_date: 2013-07-24 20:36:01
I'm going to be lucky to break even myself.  Maybe after 6 months of mining I might.  I'm not buying anymore from any vendor until they get their shit together.  Maybe sometime next year after new technology shows up, with a working product and if they can get it to me in a week.  Maybe a 50gh/s miner will be $500 by then.

I've taken coinninja.com's image they created for their controller and put it on my Beaglebone Black since it's open source.  It's like the rPi but it has more powa!  For $45 it's not a bad option.  It's powered over USB as well.  I plan on powering it by my router and connecting it to a USB hub when my miners arrive.  It doesn't have the read out like that one has but you can get the stats via web gui or through SSH.  [Find the steps on my blog.](  It's ad free and mostly for posting my projects that I do in my free time.  I don't have miners to test it on yet but they're coming in a month.  It is currently running the image though and everything seems operational.

Yeah I wouldn't underclock it.  I'd milk it for all it's worth.  Maybe sit it on some blocks under it to keep it off the ground.  You could put a partition between you and it to dampen some of the noise.

March 5th order here for a 5gh model.  Probably won't get it until September or October at the earliest, or that's the optimistic me thinks.  They are shipping jala's faster than any other so far.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:47:54
I just bought one at $150 but not with bitcoins.  If I break even in a few months, it'll be worth it even if the difficulty goes up.  I'm assuming bitcoins will continue to go up in value as well.  Even if it doesn't work out for me, it's a cheap risk.  I can lose $150 in an hour at the casino if I get a bad shoe in blackjack.

These are pretty good bang for your buck.  Jupiter is basically $7,000 for 400GH/s compared to BFL's 500GH/s which cost $22,500.  I wish I could afford a Saturn at the $3800 price tag.

I was waiting to see what Steamboat decided to do or is this his final decision?  I have 1 order in batch 5 but I've been waiting to see.  Even a refund in just chips would be nice at this point even though we'd eat the cost of full assembly.

@_date: 2013-07-30 15:50:33
I believe there will be large mining companies.  There will be less hobbyists since you have to commit to drop $$ to see any return.  Before it was just a bunch of gamers using their rigs to mine.  Current asic prices will have to be cut in half before I put anymore money into it.  That or the new asic tech needs to do at least twice the hashing power for the same price they are now and be able to ship instantly.  I hope to have 20 ghs coming to me in August and I probably will break even.  In a perfect world I'd have them already.

Companies aren't giving it to them really.  They just have network closets in all the major communication hubs in the USA that capture all the data flowing through there.

I used bitinstant last week to add $40 of bitcoins to my wallet.  This was after they shut down the cash to btc option for a day to "fix" it.  I had an email saying the transaction went through before I got home.  It's worked both times for me fine but I've only converted $150 total.  Once on the old site and once on the new.

5gh/s is around $300 right?  Basing it on bfl jala and group buy prices.  5000\300 is about $16.7.  I think if they were .15 each that they wouldn't be able to keep them in stock.

Curious why your client wouldn't just get into asics unless it's a time thing.  Does he plan on mining until the difficulty jumps then sell the cards?

Maybe one day I'll own one.  I told my dad the other day that I'd rather buy a plane than a house.  Mooney's are cool.  I've never got the opportunity to go up in one.  I went to a flight school for a year and all their planes were Mooneys.  I've only trained in 172's.  Just have my VFR license because the price per hour and fuel skyrocketed after Sept. 11.

I'll never have the cash to drop on bigger asics.  Maybe if they sold smaller miners at reasonable prices.

Fantasy sports site.  Make it only for pay leagues.  The league manager sets the required buy in for the season.  The site will have private league wallets maybe with a mixing service included.  Whoever wins the league gets paid or set it up for first, second and third.  Depends on the league manager.  Site takes a cut of the winnings.  Like 2-5%.
