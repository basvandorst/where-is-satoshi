in my opinion absolute essential for BTC to be possible new world reserve currency is stop of economically unreasonable appreciation of BTC against fiat usd (it must only reflect depreciation of fiat usd in exchange ratio). BTC must be stabilized (people must trust that stabilization is immutable and only reflect depreciation of fiat usd, building that trust take min. years) to make possible do economic calculation and take loans in BTC. Without loans with interests I doubt any economic growth, it would be much less economic activity.

I agree that recent extent of debt is unsustainable, but as you said ... Major banks were started at that time .. what is main function of banks ? to take money from citizens to savings with interests and credit another citizens/corporations on more interests ? what would be main function of bank in the era of BTC as new reserve currency ?

ok thanks so coexistence of BTC and fiat money as status quo ? I do not think that it would solve main problems of debt based economy in recent days. Also if state debts would be denominated in BTC (and government incomes and spending) is impossible with such volatility or more exponential growth of BTC such as in last 10 years. To make any economic calculation of today and tomorrow you would require stable value of money.

and this is the reason why BTC is defacto monopoly standard payment method on greatest darknet markets ... with a few alternative payment method BTC + Monero

thanks for clarification, but how can I buy house when I have not sufficient BTC without mortgage ? Only I have to wait until I have all money to buy it. OK I understand and yes it is sympathic to my personal attitude to my finances, savings, loans etc. Maybe that would be working ...

and you think that without debts for investitions, mortgages etc. there will be possible growth of national wealth ? It would have to be completely new attitude to economy activities of human beings that I cannot think about it.

thanks for offer but it is sufficient for me, there is one my doubt where BTC would be if not standard (mostly the only one payment method except few market with alternative Monero) for paying on darknet (drugs etc.) ?

fair would be give all persons on the Earth at given time (or inception) same fraction of BTC on their account (wallets) managed by BTC creator or any Corp. created by him for this the only one reason.
Yes I mean that it is not necessary to increase number of BTC gradually (degressively) until 2140, I mean that all 21 mil. BTC could be produced in the time of inception.
