No actually they're not.
Most of them don't pay dividends and the ones that do can simply decide to stop paying dividends anytime they want.
You don't actually own anything in the company or even have a say in the company you just own a piece of paper that hopefully some poor sucker will buy from you later for more then you paid for it.

It's not trolling if it's true.

Why don't you tell me how I'm wrong then?
Come on embarrass yourself by showing how very little you actually know.

You can't eat gold.
It's really only a good investment until everything collapses and then it's worthless kind of like crypto and fiat.
The only things that would be worth anything in a collapse are fuel food water and ammo/weapons.

I think anyone that didn't sell around 18-19k aren't very smart.
The signs were all there that it wasn't going much higher.
It's been doing nothing but declining since and still people continue to hodl as they watch their profits decline day after day.
I feel a little bad for everybody that is gonna lose money but not too bad because most had a chance to break even or take a small profit and get out as it rallied back nearly every time before it fell even lower the next time.
Not smart to hodl if it's falling lower and lower by the day.

Google this tard.
can a company stop paying dividends
First answer they can increase lower stop or start paying them anytime they want.
They don't need stock holders approval either.
3 good examples of companies not paying dividends are Google Amazon and Facebook so what are you even talking about?

The only positive from the mining situation is those elite miners are gonna be trying extremely hard to keep the price up.

Those new investors are what is propping the entire thing up since it's a ponzi scheme it requires new investors for the older investors to be able to cash out.
All the profits come from the people that get in after you.
When it nears the point of not enough new investors buying in vs sellers trying to cash out then you should already be out as it's gonna either take a huge dip or crash.
Some will be mad that I called it a ponzi scheme but it is a ponzi just like the stock market.

The owner/head of the company essentially as they are the ones who nominate the board.
Owner usually owns 51% of the stock and the owner is usually head of the company.
This means the owner has pretty much 100% control over who is on the board since he/she nominates the board and has the majority of the voting power.
