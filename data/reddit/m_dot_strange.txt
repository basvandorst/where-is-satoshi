I'm just wondering where you got that "ten grand" number from- is that number based on facts or just hearsay?
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:43:26
I hope you don't have any funds stuck in there- I hope to travel to Iran myself someday- if you need a new exchange might want to try out these two decentralized ones Bitsquare  and Coinffeine  If you can use the services they use to get fiat in like OkPay, perfectmoney then you are good to go-

So the verification is required for buys $10,000+ ? I never bought that much at a time from Coinbase but still required the verification-
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:26:49
Coinbase was pretty cool until you have to tell them where you get your funds, what you do for a living, scan your id and give them your ssn- thats MORE info that what my standard bank requires.
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:18:27
Sounds like a great service- thx for posting
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:35:29
I'm sure it is- that extra verification added to the direction Coinbase and their CEO wants bitcoin to go has caused me to no longer be a Coinbase customer- How do bitcoin ATM's in the U.S. get around the verification? There's one close to me that requires no identity verification/info

This was awesome- I'm happy I was able to donate to the fund ^_^

Who cares what VISA thinks- their end started as soon as the blockchain started growing
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:49:55
True DAT!

A really old and crappy bitcoin exchange seems to be dead/dying because of incompetence- lots of people might have lost a lot of money IF they are bankrupt/insolvent but no one knows yet- so some people are freaking out and selling ENCOURAGED by others spreading FEAR so they can drive the price lower to buy more for less.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:06:22
Great idea- just donated ^ ^

Doesn't have to have anything to do with the UFC- if there was a site that listed the confirmed public addresses of UFC fighters or the fighters themselves shared their addresses on twitter/social whatever- then the UFC wouldn't be involved- they could try to "ban" it but damn that would look really bad
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:45:00
I've been using coinbase for the past year- awesome service- I've gotten about 15 people to open accounts with them as its the easiest way for someone new to bitcoin to buy coin- I LOVE that "identity verification" is an optional step I hope it stays that way.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:40:16
Face camera too?! Wtf
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:39:43
Bitcoin and the other cryptos I buy/trade are working great as usual- there's really nothing to see- In times of FUD in the Bitcoin world I recommend listening to this... BLOCKCHAIN BITCH AINT NUTHIN TO FUCK WITH! 
@_date: 2014-05-05 07:11:38
I think thats a great idea- one day it would be awesome if all the fighters had QR's/public addresses so fans could tip any fighters they wanted to support directly.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:57:33
spot on- awesome response from Blockchain!

For all you bitcoiners looking into Android devices for the first time be sure to check out  as the OS to run on your phone as everything is unlocked and you can do whatever you want with your device.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:00:23
I have an early Nexus phone and as Google updated some of their applications they prevented my older phone from using them- when I switched to Cyanogen I was able to install and run the apps that Google said were incompatible with my phone- So Cyanogen does more "unlocking" than buying an unlocked phone does
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:46:24
Great idea ^ ^ Hope you bought in during that dip to $550 usd
@_date: 2014-05-03 05:04:57
I make independent animated feature films and this sounds like a good idea to me! 
I don't think the big guys/aggregators/studios/distributors would go for this BUT underground people like me probably would- 
Right now the best place for indie filmmakers to sell our films is this place--&gt; VHX btw can find my films here  BUT they offer no bitcoin integration- I asked for it but they said it wasn't a priority
SO if you made a version of popcorn-time that pulled in torrents/content from willing filmmakers like myself and allowed bitcoin tips that would be awesome-
The only sort of practical way for filmmakers to do something similar is through Frostwire 
But that doesn't have any easy/elegant interface like popcorn time

This useless politician and the entire system will be replaced by decentralized services stemming from a blockchain- there is nothing they can do to stop it- they'll whine and make threats but lose in the end.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:13:56
I hope all goes well for you! It really made me angry to see what they are doing to you- totally unfair and fucked up- best to you man!
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:04:40
Cellphone number+palm scan+Drivers License 0_o I would never use that thing!
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:49
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight- HODL HODL HODL! Not falling for these scams-
Cryptocurrency is here to stay.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:06:24
I'm going to do the same thing- don't have much to spend myself but its a great buying opportunity for sure. After this gox drama ends- things will be looking up again as theres so much other good news outside of that creepy uncle gox has done with his unprotected gox.
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:05:11
Before hearing this news today I was sending some coin to and from coinbase and blockchain.info- no problems at all. The honey badger seems to be giving zero fucks with my transactions ^ ^
@_date: 2014-02-24 01:06:50
Where else can one make a BIP38 protected paper wallet besides  
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:10:35
I'll be throwing in 1 btc - not because I hope to make money on it but because I think its a great idea and I would like it to succeed- I would also like Ethereum and Bitcloud to succeed as well- Sidechains? Bring those on as well! Real positive change and internet freedom is around the corner- exciting times!
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:44:45
I was just reading this article  on "Bitcoin 2.0" and yeh things are just beginning-Colored coins and more! It's going to be awesome!
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:53:50
Awesome idea! 
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:25:33
Brilliant idea in Coinplanter! What IF it was integrated with Minecraft somehow? : ) 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:50:09
Oh its not that I don't like it- just wanted to look at all the options before I move my cold storage into BIP38
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:56:23
I have it installed- have never used it- it does BIP38 paper wallets? I'll have a look
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:59:12
I've done two wire transfers in my life from bank to bank which cost about $85 for both- that alone is much more than I've spent in about 2 years using bitcoin- not to mention the numerous "Foreign transaction fees" I've had to pay for daring to use my U.S. bank card in other countries and other ridiculous bank fees-
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:54:57
What price are you waiting for sir?
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:03:23
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:45:03
So ummm if someone invested when it was $1 or $50 how are they getting "screwed" when a "crash" has it at $600 now?
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:37:26
Good for you! HODL strong! : )

Amir is awesome! 
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:14:38

Amir Taaki's Bitcoin is the one I am excited about- the whole please everybody and follow "authority" is really tired and will lead to nothing new-
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:12:10
Yeh the context is really bizarre- it seems like he just comes out of nowhere with that- that might have been a question from the audience-
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:36:20
Another awesome Vitalik moment- another one was when he recreated Counterparty in a few hours on Ethereum- MIC DROP
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:30:52
I asked the person who did the transcription if GA was responding to an audience query- he said that he wasn't 
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:10:08
If that is what you want, sure 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:43:45
Yes that was my plan as well- help them set up wallets them give them BTC- I gave my wife BTC as a wedding gift earlier this year- its 8 times more valuable now then when I gave it to her- btc as a gift rules ^_^
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:08:58
I second bitfloor- have only had good experiences with them.
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:18:55
HEy! Yeh the art books are still for sale- sadly they are made by createspace/amazon so no bitcoin there : ( Sorry! I'm selling my new film using bitpay thought ^_^
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:11:47
I also agree- bitcoin is a change I want to see in the world so I'm sticking with it through thick and thin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:59:55
It was a little slow yesterday during the chaos but I was still able to purchase bitcoin with bitfloor.com- I've used it a few times and have no complaints- its a little slow to process some times but you get the coin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:15:23
Oh yes it seems the pump and dumpers got you with their "to tha moon" tactic- they even have their own theme song now PUMP AND DUMP 
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:20:25
Thank you ^_^
