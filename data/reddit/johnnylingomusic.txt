Earlier this weeks Steve Wozniak praises bitcoin as digital gold.  Then today announces he sold all his coins of course perfectly at the ATH cause his vision was to travel and only pay for things with it and also he doesn't want to be stressing about the price.  Like seriously?  WTF does he really care about the price, that man does not need Money, nor will his kids or Grandkids and their kids
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:24:21
cool thanks for sharing.  i guess if it were to happen the good news is in the long term it should come back
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:26:28
this cheesy thing to hang on a doorknob that can stretch your neck. was a last minute holiday gift wasnt thinking clearly
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:22:09
well said, I've heard enough of the myspace Facebook bs
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:13:28
cool thanks for your response...its been a rough couple weeks
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:11:19
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:20:29
good point Lol.  I thought it would continue to 25k and then correct.  This correction seems like forever, but the other ones felt that way too, you just instantly forget once it comes back
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:23:34
I got in last May, and its scary how Bitcoin's 2017 chart mimics the classic Bubble chart.  Who could explain How this is not going to be the case?  I mean I feel like i had to fight a bloody war all of last year to hold on to my investment and if it goes back to 3k-4k that would be all for nothing.  I also don't see it could happen because Bitcoin is a product that has many use case's, currently works, and is being improved upon.  Where as the Dot Com bust for example, was because of too many companies that weren't really good companies yet
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:33:15
absolutely.  The reason i invested was when i understood how significant of an invention it is and breakthrough technology with many use cases and solves problems i didn't realize existed..  I feel like I've learned more about economics from Bitcoin than my college degree.  While I do think 100k is not an unrealistic price projection, the next time it runs up, hopefully i've learned my lesson to take some profits along the way so the corrections are easier to weather  
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:56:34
i fought tooth and nail to hold my position since May.  I think it would be total BS if people get to buy sub-9k.  And its not looking good for you if you think you're gonna get it at those prices.  IMO, becoming more risky to think that each day
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:28:38
very true, i always forget how small the market still is
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:52:25
whatever his strategy was in this case, i was more pointing out that one of the articles is probably a Lie.  He came out this week praising Bitcoin as the New gold, and then an article comes out today saying he sold at the 20k top which was a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:28:50
oh yea?  that's an interesting statistic.  any links for sources?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:24:39
haha!  seriously!
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:11:00
very true 
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:01:11
I had the ah ha moment last May just from hearing about it again from mainstream news.  Though it was learning about Ethereum that made me finally get Bitcoin and what the whole space was about.  Also learning that Bitcoin is a breakthrough in computer science and genius technological invention that is global and can not be shut down and its the first time in history that ppl have a legitimate secure option outside of govt. control is such a big deal its unbelievable that the price isn't already 100k.  And the having the regulated exchanges like Coinable and Gemini as well as the option to put on Hardware wallet, made it possible for somebody not computer savvy like myself to finally get involved.  If you don't have anything in this space now is as good of a time as any, especially if its for a 1-5 year holding period.  I would def get some ETH and maybe LTC as well.    
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:10:42
ahh good points! 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:58:25
you know whats weird is yes this article was is from October 22nd., but it was this week that I read it.  Somebody posted it to Reddit actually, and it was from a different publisher.  Thing is I was trying to find it today and couldn't
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:27:40
seriously hope its the bottom.  Its amazing how the euphoria moments make everybody want to buy, and then times like these they say forget it.  Thats definitely the sentiment from the different families I've talked to about it since i got involved  Also, the high price makes them think its not worth it and alts will make them gains, but don't realize how much more risky they are.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:55:19
WOW  is this guy legit?  
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:29:48
Guys lets face it Crypto could become a niche product, a collectible like baseball cards.  Its a great product but only cool to a small demographic.  The majority of the population just doesn't give a shit.  They are fine having an authority control their water, food, air, money, and even their Daylight Savings (kudos to V. Buterin for that twitter post).  
Yes I'm being sarcastic but also half serious.  The average person really doesn't give shit about the use cases and potential game changing technology behind Bitcoin and others.  They like to Get in Line, be told what to do, work "their" jobs and always take it up the ass deeper and deeper.
I imagine a big reason people invested in this space like me is because they are sick and tired of the old legacy elite power systems.  Obvious its the big reason Bitcoin was created in the first place., but the problem is will the Sheep ever wake the f up!  Or they gonna be like cool, the Fed released a Digital currency, my boss is like you want lame ass dollars or the new fed coin man!  Yea! Hey Johnny sorry about your Bitcoin, this Fed Coin is so cool, its like cash without a bank account and I don't have to think for myself.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:06:52
the author of this Victor Dergunov is a total scam artist.  His last article said Bitcoin is going to go to 1,000.  Watch out for him
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:10:06
Facebook banning Crypto ads so people don't get scammed. Funny cause i got scammed buying something on FB over the holidays and it wasn't crypto related
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:22:37
I started investing in this space in May 2017 and i have to admit this is the first time I'm actually getting bored.  Its funny how the WSJ had an article about the fact that your friends and family don't want to hear about your Bitcoin fascination anymore and now people like me don't want to talk about it anymore anyway.  I've already made my investment and know for a fact that at least in the long term between my BTC or ETH, one of those will at the very least double in price from these levels.  And That is absolutely the worst case scenario and most unlikely.  A more probable scenario is that both of those coins and others will do very well.   
In addition, the main reason i was telling people about crypto in the first place is because i see it as an amazing financial opportunity and would feel guilty not telling ppl about it.  Well I tried that, and now the WSJ is saying shut up too.  Good thing is now i won't feel guilty when this shit starts to get real again.  Perhaps in a few weeks....
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:09:47
wouldn't be surprised if the futures are a non-event.  Then maybe it pumps on Sunday.  Or we continue sideways until Super Bowl.  And then there is some Ad on tv and everybody freaks out.

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:29:10
cool thanks!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:45:37
r/bitcoin should have a daily non-price discussion and a daily price discussion.  cmon don't be lame its so fun
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:59
14 could be the low.  Remember people bought at 18, so 14 is a deal.  and layer your buys, so if it goes lower you will have funds available.  If it starts going higher same deal.  At this point any Long Term play below 18k is solid
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:01:48
i was on the 5k to 3k ride and here for this.  i completely agree that this is similar.  i think the 12-13k range is a screaming buy.  There is so much positive momentum for 2018 there's no way the Bitcoin ride is closing. And i also remember clearly that when it crashed from 5k-3k it took over a month to recover, felt like forever.  So Hodl' and accumulate if you can, and you will be partying and feel like a genius come the end of February
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:20:27
If the bottom really is in then I am for sure experiencing the "Disbelief" stage.
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:46:41
I've always thought its not worth paying to learn about Bitcoin/Crypto  when you can learn everything for free about it online.  Not only that, the people online are engaged in the thick of it versus a professor who is just looking from the outside in.  In addition, I really hope you have bought some Bitcoin and transferred out of an exchange to experience the tech.  You could argue the best thing to do right now is buy it then study, and as you study you could find yourself buying more
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:10:10
good points
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:36:31
gemini is way better than coinbase.  they've always responded to my emails within 24 hours and website never crashes.  Feels more secure too, coinbase is like walmart and gemini like high end shop on Fifth ave.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:00:23
yea, i think its a problem on his part.  There's no way its an issue to exchange for USD and then transfer from exchange to bank account.  If there was it would be all over the internet or news
@_date: 2018-09-21 00:22:00
Wow.  this was a telling read.  i really appreciate you sharing.  been having a hard time these last few weeks surviving this bear.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:15:06
ok so nobody has tried taken USD out of exchange?  i can't imagine it being a problem. I think my friend had an id issue.  
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:21:08
I like your conclusion. Makes sense. And that is also the reason you get rewarded if you can hold on.  Its no surprise that most people sell their coins too early. Very hard to survive in this market
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:48:31
I'm thinking we are going to get another ATH by end of this year, or early into next such as what happened in 2013.  There were two breaks ATH's that year i think
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:27:57
absolutely, but the good news is...even at 15k its still early..
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:42:30
haven't we been hurt enough?  If we go down to 3k that would bring on the most pain 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:02
also they said they would send out an Email if anything changes.  never did, had to log into coinbase to know what the hell was happening
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:43:58
this guy makes a lot of sense as to why the price hasn't sky rocketed yet.  its coming....
@_date: 2018-08-05 22:06:44
interesting perspective.  could they really control it? suppress it?  I imagine the set fixed supply presents a problem to their manipulative shenanigans.

And everybody knows that Buffet didn't invest in most of the biggest Tech companies that currently dominate. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:18:47
if they were to do that now then the market won't grow and nobody will make any money.  Wall street def wants to make a shit ton of money off crypto.  Also I think it would be a challenge as I imagine regulators will require proof they have the physical coins
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:11:51
anybody have a link to read the WSJ story on Tether?
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:53:23
as far as i read today is just a meeting.  So the market is just going to move based on the sentiment.  Im really optimistic as they've had over two years to make a decision and they've done nothing so far
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:13:25
Just heard Crypto was front page of WSJ today.  Hopefully thats a sign of bottom.  
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:09:14
agree i forsee it becoming common to get exposure to Bitcoin through your retirement , even if just 1% will be huge.  And it sounds like bank settlements will be huge too.  The one thing i don't understand is that Bakkt will function like the lightning network in that they will have a set pool of Bitcoin they use.  so would that mean they won't be buying new coins?   a little confused by that but if there is demand the price has to rise.  Nobody does anything on Wall Street unless they can make money
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:43:45
ahh thanks so much i was stressed that i would lose my coins!
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:14:40
this is my attitude too.  Im gonna keep buying little by little until the bull market begins whether its 2 months or 2 years from now.  
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:46:34
Got a Question about Segwit hoping someone can answer.  I transferred some BTc off Coinbase to my Nano S and on the Nano S selected the Segwit option over the Legacy.  If I try to send some BTC back to Coinbase does it matter whether its Segwit or Legacy?  
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:22:38
the market is only a little over 100 billion right now.  Its just not big enough for them to fuck with yet.  This might be a concern when its much bigger
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:16:51
Finally read this article.  Hodl tight I can't see any way around Bitcoin not having a bright future. Short term is just noise.  this article is a must read if you haven't already
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:20:59
I feel like I can smell the beginnings of the realization of a bottom and disbelief return of a bull market.  Perhaps this year will end with the believers and holders proven Right.  Frankly, we deserve it.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:40:46
Buffet and Gates are some of the biggest Frauds and liars in history.  I wouldn't be concerned about their opinions on Bitcoin.  The SEC meeting is way more relevant
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:37:29
cool thanks, glad i finally understand this!

@_date: 2019-03-14 13:14:58
whats your opinion on its ability to only do 7 transactions a second?  Just using the digital gold narrative, lets say it becomes a popular investment id imagine there would be a lot of ppl that would want their coins confirmed on the blockchain versus buying on exchange and leaving there.  Also i assume FDA has to have all its coins on the blockchain, and if Bakkt ever happens they would as well.  However, theres so much speculation that happens mainly on exchanges which is off chain.  
I guess my point is last bull run, transactions got really slow and expensive, which would still work if its just digital gold, but at prices of 100k per coin there could be a lot more on chain transactions and i wonder if it could take days to confirm?   (btw for this example Lightning network is separate but its potentially what something like Bakkt will be using, i believe they are gonna kind of be like their own lightning).
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:26:59
cool thanks great point but are you referring to Lightning or suggesting that they will increase the tps onchain?
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:35:40
how long have you been invested/into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:45:21
@_date: 2019-03-21 01:25:29
i thought the ordinary people wave was over after 2017, but agree the whole institutional narrative could be just a distraction.  All the market needs it for it to get back over 10k and then everybody will pile on
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:04:29
do you follow  crypto on twitter?  his whole theory about the cartel and futures launching certainly screws with my head, but i find it hard to believe.  So far its just a coincidence
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:04:34
The Gap between the Hash Rate and Price is like a war, probably the most bullish thing out there.  Miners are holding it down against any powers that be who are trying to suppress/control bitcoin.  [
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:44:39
What if we go past ATH's again without major institutions?  Its quite possible that the mania from 2017 just happens again as it gives more credence to what crypto is really all about.  There doesn't need to be institutions/groups.  Anybody can buy bitcoin/crypto and its easier than ever with Robinhood/cashapp.  A True power to the ppl movement
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:42:16
lucky you to buy then sell!  Why did you sell if you're a long term believer?  was it too obvious?  so hard to call the tops/bottoms i don't think most ppl thought it would go back this low.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:10:24
this is wrong.  the question is how much are they going to ensure per wallet.  other than that its totally legit, no chance of Mt. Gox style happening at Gemini
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:56:06
I think the analysis in this article is right.  And a panelist at the bloomberg sooner than you think conference suggested that Traders are in control of this market and could take it to 3k before the rise past ATH's again. Prepare for the worst and see out 1-3 years
@_date: 2018-10-03 14:59:19
Im surprised we are not getting some spill over effect from stocks at ATH's
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:08:39
this should be a quote.  in times like these i feel crazy , like why is the price still so low.  The points you make are very valuable IMO
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:11:45
seems to be holding up well today, very nervous about tonight though
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:10:08
great points
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:45:43
I started investing in May and still have coins on Coinbase and Gemini.  It's in their best interest to never get hacked.  Like if that happens once they will lose all their customers.  So I think it's very secure.  If anything I would call your phone company to make sure that's secure.  Research and get educated on best cold storage option and start to slowly transfer when ready.  But realistically I think leaving them on exchange for awhile will be fine
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:04:37
maybe its some scheme where they don't insure the cold wallet cause its fractional reserve, but its good to know if you have coins on there its insured.  Big step in right direction.  Our money in normal bank accounts isn't really there either.  Obviously storing in cold storage on your own is the best , but that's unlikely to gain mass adoption
@_date: 2018-10-03 13:54:19
Since Apple hit 1 trillion its added 118 billion, more than Bitcoins current Market cap.  The stock market gains in general have destroyed crypto's appeal.  Nobody cares about it right now.  I wonder if this Bakkt thing is really going to do anything.  The concept of it goes completely against what Bitcoin is designed for.  Im optimistic about it but who the f knows at this point
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:04:59
invest the amount you can comfortably manage not spending for 3-5 years.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:08:28
Yep I bought one at 2900, watched it drop to 1839, and now loving the price.  Feels great when you are solidly in the green.  And if I had the money to buy one at 4K I would, cause odds are even that price will seem like a bargain long term
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:42:55
I think at the most it could correct down to $2800,  but it also might never go below $3500 again, and if it does correct it will be a fast correction over the course of a week and then back up.  This time it really is different, can't compare to 2013.  If anything we all should b thankful we are in now, 4K will seem like a bargain a year from now
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:14:09
Totally agree.  i can only start imagining once I see the news article that its live and CFTC approved.  Curious if anybody knows the answer to this : Because Bakkt is part of ICE would that mean that traders in the PIT at NYSE will soon have the option to simply click a button on their terminal?  Im assuming it will be that smoothly integrated
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:35:30
lots of problems out there, maybe we go through a longer term 3-4 year bear, but its unlikely
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:51:30
Totally agree, and you have established trusted US based exchanges.  Sure there will be corrections but they could be smaller and short with a quick continual rise to at least 10k
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:32:40
Hold for a year from now don't even think about selling
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:48:10
my new tenants own some BTC very smart nerd type ivy league school 25 year olds.  They bought in around October 2017 and can't wait to sell just to get their money back
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:04:59
sure but it makes you experience the technology versus having an opinion on something that you've never experienced 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:31:12
i think the more significant thing about the high of 20k was like holy shit, it went to 20k, do you realize how much of a big deal that is?  Now the only question is how long until the next ATH and then how high will it go.  This is the birth of a industry.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:05:47
yes agree
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:46:52
maybe i wasn't clear, I'm only talking 1-5% of their funds.  
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:18:36
congrats.  we are getting to the end stage of it being realistic for anybody to ever own an entire bitcoin.  When this takes off again forget about it for sure.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:52:09
if i were knew to this space i would put 50% of my funds down right now and the next 50% once the market decides its direction

id bought at 6500 and when it went to 6700 so now sitting out.  but id say everybody is scared to buy right now, which is usually the best time to buy.  And in response to to the person below saying its going to 1k...no way.  maybe we get into the 5's, but no lower - IMO
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:34:24
very true, but Bitcoin is a new asset class where as gold has established itself over 5000+years.  And if you bought gold in the 70's and held until now your asset has appreciated 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:14:03
such as World peace?  There's no money in that, but there is plenty of money to be made in crypto.  Its the birth of a new asset class.  Tons of money in getting 1-5% of ppl's 401k's exposure.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:44:18
exactly this and most ppl don't get it
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:45:02
every market has peaks and valleys.  living in the valley is an opportunity to live on the peak
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:41:36
Unless some major negative news comes out id say by the end of this year. Maybe 10k -12k sometime this summer
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:56:29
I know thats what i thought too, didn't really have time to get into details, but they are clearly not into it.  The reason i shared this was to give a real world example of where ppl's heads are at.  I think there's a lot of people who bought in without understanding and believing in the the tech and now they just want their money back
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:29:55
just because its called digital gold doesn't mean you can compare it use case's of gold.  They have different use cases.  Bitcoin is a technological invention similar to digital bank accounts with the difference being that you are the owner of the bank
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:43:52
yes but bitcoin is the longest running and most trusted blockchain.  how is that going to get upended unless we all adopt government blockchains and decide bitcoin is a joke
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:20:12
have you used it?  Im looking for someone to admit they use it
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:36:03
YEs Agreeing is welcomed and well said!
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:03:12
Lol yes I'm sure a lot of ppl did cash out but making money is not the only reason the bitcoin technology was created.  For me personally, i know that when it breaks the next ATH's i will probably regretfully sell some only to watch it double to 40k or wherever it goes.  However, i will always keep a decent amount for long term 5-10 years, and i imagine that any early adopters/believers who did sell at the last ATH's did not sell all of it
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:45:44
How long have you been researching Bitcoin?

Very true.  I don't think theres a clear cut answer to this 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:38:34
ok lets talk about retirement funds dude.  You generally buy different funds depending on your age.  Younger people get put into riskier portfolios while older more conservative.  thats how my wife 401k works and she didn't know what she was in until i started researching it.  If you have a 100k in your retirement putting 1,000 into a Bitcoin ETF is not going to bankrupt you.  And what about 2008?  What if you retired then?  
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:37:25
This just proves that the ppl investing in Bitcoin are ahead of the curve and on the right side of history.  I feel bad for anyone that reads this and doesn't know any better and decides bitcoin is dumb or too risky. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:49:04
funny how the ppl who are bitcoin skeptics, or super bearish and thinks its ponzi etc., don't realize that of course Wall Street wants to create a new asset class regardless of whether or not they like it.  Its not so much about the price, more about the products they can sell the public.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:48:30
this is a good point, i have to think about it. One thing is the adoption of a technology.  Bitcoin is a very new technology and it hasn't been adopted yet where as gold was adopted and valued way before exchanges existed 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:56:13
i guess we will find out who is right in the long run.  If this is your opinion then why are you on r/bitcoin?  If you think Bitcoin is a joke then go buy regular stocks.
Bitcoin is a technological invention and it hasn't been really adopted yet.  Thats the risk early adopters take, but they will reap the financial rewards, whereas late adopters will be users of the technology and will get financial incentive but not like the early adopters
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:20:17
The average joe has worst problems than what bitcoin can solve.  most ppl have no savings and just need money in general.  They can't afford to invest in BTC or anything for that matter.  There is an irony though in that the average joe has the most to gain if he were to invest in Bitcoin, just like he could if he got into Apple or Amazon or etc. early.  This is just a rule of the Matrix type world we live in.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:20:45
i hate to admit it but that would cause maximum pain
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:53:44
Lol true that
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:06:44
this sucks its like asking DAD if its OK to do something.  its kind of BS
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:34:17
digital gold does not mean it can't be volatile.  Investing in gold is generally a longer time horizon type of investment and so far in Bitcoin's history if you hold for the long term you never lose, only gain
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:04:08
i think having the bitcoin price is very telling of the future to come.  they are doing it for a reason
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:10:27
So far the low of 2018 is about 5700.  If that's as low it gets then the haters are in for some serious cognitive dissonance 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:24:12
i heard that futures don't do markets less than 100 billion though.  do you have any insight into that?
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:19:07
will be an interesting week for sure  
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:04:52
Bitcoin is the first global digital asset in history that the entire world can participate in and decide together what its value is.  In many ways its a global social network store of value, where the users decide its value and there is no leader or centralized party, instead we trust a program, a computer.  We can also send it to each other without anybody's permission or censoring.   
Right now this assets value, global market cap wise is around 105 billion.  What do you think its worth?  
And it cannot become myspace'd for one simple reason.  It is the most TRUSTED coin because it has the longest blockchain in mother f-ing HISTORY! Debate me on this!!
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:43:11
i don't totally follow this, but id argue that ppl you are buying and holding now will reap the financial rewards as well as the benefits of using the technology while the later stage buyers will be buying because it has become accepted as part of society.  Whether that it becomes and asset in their 401k or they buy some to use it, or hold onto to make appreciation - but in smaller percentage terms
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:54:55
I'm still calling 120k blow off top this year...
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:07:24
and if you experience bitcoin (especially if you put on a hardware wallet) and then decide its not for you, id doubt you would spend any more time on forum's such as r/bitcoin.  Cause whats the point of debating ppl about a subject/technology you don't like.  A person's time is way more valuable
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:56:38
i disagree. its already proven itself to be digital gold.  With the advent of Nano S's and Trezors this is even more obvious.  Putting your coins on a hardware wallet also give you experience with the technology, which most ppl don't ever experience because they just buy on Coinbase and panic sell 
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:35:13
what was your timeline when you invested? and what was your reasoning for investing?  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:41:30
of course I'm in it for financial gains, but ultimately i don't want to just cash it out, id love to use it, especially for big purchases like car or house down payment.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:39:04
Bitcoin being digital gold only means it has similar characteristics to gold, but they are not the same.  So comparing the cost structure is not a good comparison.  
Ok so you say Now Sell me a Bitcoin.  A big reason to own bitcoin is because it is a technology based on math and computer science that is outside the control of any person or government.  There is also a limited supply and don't forget why Bitcoin was invented -  out of the financial crisis.  Now that bitcoin exists, there is competition to the legacy financial system
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:21:45
Im only advocating a super small allocation to crypto such as 1-5%.    And what about what happened in 2008?
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:40:00
when i say we all I'm assuming that blockchain will be adopted and imo bitcoin will become much more adopted than it is now.  I don't see the benefit in government blockchains other than to increase efficiency 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:12:30
I think the more important question here is do you even own Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:53:32
so why are you on r/bitcoin then?if you think its worthless than wouldn't your time be better spent somewhere else?
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:54:24
yes i agree.  I couldn't help myself and bought a little more last night.  will buy again if it hits into the 5's.  There's zero reason to sell here, only buy more if you can 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:39:16
I disagree, Bitcoin's value is derived from its social network effect.  Its also an opportunity to own an a global asset that is outside the control of any government or person, but instead valued by the people of the world.  And don't forget its a technological invention.  
Btw Apples stock or Amazons stock value is only derived from what someone else will pay for it too, sure its value is affected by many factors like earnings per share blah blah..but bitcoin's value is also affected by many factors - they are just different and ppl stuck in the legacy mindset have a hard time understanding
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:16:12
this is exactly what I've been thinking.  even .5% of 401k's would be huge
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:00:25
Why wouldn't it happen?  Its an amazing technological invention that has the power to change the world.  Its potential has barely been realized.  What could possibly disrupt it?
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:51:21
lets keep it simple.  Rich kids and adults want to have crypto on a Ledger Nano S or Trezor or whatever cause its cool.  Im not saying Bitcoin is going to make the world a better place.  Its a technology
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:15:09
wow that'd be crazy
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:37:04
thanks for sharing! this is the kind of conversation i need.  I got really into this end of May 2017 and after digesting tons of info had no choice but to read the white paper.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:57:57
Bitcoin has similar characteristics to gold in that over time the people that hold onto it have been rewarded in its appreciation.  But there are many difference's between the assets.
The fact that bitcoin is a technology that is valuable and gives control to the users and the entire world can participate outside of what their government thinks is a value proposition.  You don't have to participate though if you think its bullshit.
Financial Crisis - The federal Reserve decides on the monetary supply.  Bitcoin takes that power away from them.  Bitcoin also solves the problem of centralized sources becoming too powerful.  However it would be possible for a centralized source to buy a lot of bitcoin, in that case only early adopters would benefit.
Bitcoin's existence is competition to the legacy system just like email was/is to the post office.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:44:06
i was feeling very optimistic about this being about the bottom.  hadn't checked out Tone Vays for a while and decided to watch his analysis this morning and man he just killed my buzz.
Also heard but haven't verified that futures markets need to be over 100 billion?  So if bitcoin crashes i wonder if futures would be over?  Wouldn't make much sense now that CME and CBOE invested in it
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:45:57
Lol yea Ive never been totally convinced on his analysis.  but he is consistent with his videos and sometimes entertaining 
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:20:54
Do you use it?  I'm looking for someone to admit using it
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:35:01
Who here has been in this since the last top in 2013?  did you sell any in 2017?  My general impression is that most people don't time this market well, usually they sell too early and buy back in too early or sell and never come back only to check the price a few years later and regret.  Why would this time be any different?  We could be in for a prolonged bear market but that doesn't mean this is going to die out.  The history of bitcoin already is a fascinating story, do you really think this is how it ends?  If so, Hollywood won't be able to make a blockbuster movie about it, not enough has happened to impact the world yet.  
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:00:44
Who here actually uses Tether?  I've yet to see an article or quote of somebody that uses it.  Im not saying nobody uses it, more like it'd be great to get feedback/opinion from ppl that use it
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:15:57
and then what?  It just dies and all the ppl working in this industry go to work for Facebook, Apple Google etc.?  Crypto is a new asset class and Wall street is embracing it.  They want to SELL things to ppl and all of their clients want exposure.  And most Americans with 401k's will have no prob putting in a small percentage of their retirement into it.  Its a no brainer
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:01:11
it provides a ton of value.  You can be your own bank.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:52:31
couldn't you argue that right now nobody wants to buy?
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:19:48
if you need some inspiration to hold watch the first 12 minutes of this   Recent interviews with ppl in the industry.  should help you see the long term picture better
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:20:45
Has some scary tweets though, saying the backlog of BTC transactions will crash price, idk though it's a little over my head
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:00:09
i don't think the myspace/facebook argument is valid.  Bitcoin is MONEY.  Those websites are free to use.  Bitcoin is the first Viral Dapp and is breaking down the walls of an old system.  Websites can come an go, but this is in a different category.  As long as bitcoin doesn't fail from its code, i think the future is up.
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:39:09
BTC - is a Technological Invention.  A digital asset that you control, in your possession - the digital gold.  There is no reason to use it for payments.  That part doesn't even matter right now.  Invest for this reason and you will be rewarded in the long term.  Under the digital gold thesis it would be very hard to replace bitcoin.  Trust is the most important factor with new technology, Bitcoin has never failed, it is the most trusted.  If you have a 3-4 minimum time horizon, you should at the very least see it break ATH's.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:24:43
in hindsight this will be known as a great big shakeout.  The further down prices go the more explosive a move up will become.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see a 100% daily move this year.  So many ppl would miss out.  The lower the price goes the less money it takes to make it spike
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:05:35
i appreciate your response, this is my third correction and feels the most uncertain
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:47:50
And everybody should do the same thing still at these prices!!!  Come back when its $30k and thank me.  Remember this post!  $30k by August 2018!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:15:13
Ok yea I figure and hope so, am thrown off cause when I originally got into BTC he had great info/videos and helped convince me of the future
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:01:26
What does everybody think of Rick Falkvinge?  He was in BTC since the beginning and seems really against BTC now and pro-bitcoin cash.  Kind of has me worried
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:01:50
Yes I was there too for Jafari's call back in July. If History repeats itself then perhaps BTC hits 8k then correction to 6k (maybe 5K) then back up
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:06:51
Bitcoin is a technological invention for a new type of money/store of value.  It's better than anything that has ever existed before and it's transactional.  And if you don't like the fees you exchange it for a better crypto when you are ready to make purchases.  Bitcoin is your savings and another coin is your checking.  as more and more ppl wake up to this, it's value rises.  IMO this is why we buy it.  All the other arguments are important but secondary.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:06:45
good points!
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:45:34
Lol I'm most interested in the point he makes about the futures contracts only having a 20% spread and bitcoin could crush that which could cause major issues  
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:22:07
theres an article from Gizmodo about him claiming he's satoshi.  google that and then google why he's not satoshi.  theres tons of info 
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:54:41
buy the dip?
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:25:02
my bets were placed in the summer of 2017 Lol.  I agree about 2019, and glad that Bakkt and ETH upgrade and Fidelity and other stuff is all happening next year.  Rest of the year we can give crypto a rest, unless you have the means to accumulate
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:51:18
yea i know , lots of uncertainty right now.  maybe crypto is the dream that becomes nothing.  and nothing changes.  we remain in the same system cause the money gods rule the world and we are slaves.  However, why would ICE spend millions building Bakkt and Fidelity start FDA.  Why are they investing in the infrastructure ?
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:40:07
also i think the Social Network aspect of Bitcoin/Crypto is being underestimated and mainstream media certainly has not mentioned it
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:20:27
you will wake up tomorrow to a price between $8250-8500.  maybe 8600 if we are lucky.  I feel confident its going to stay over 8k.  get some rest and stop looking at the price for 12 hours.  The bears are running out of ammo.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:45:23
so in other words we are very close to the bottom agree?
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:20:58
Last night of all nights I dug into the proof that Craig Wright provides to supposedly prove he's Satoshi.  What amazes me is the great lengths he's gone to do this.  The story is really complicated.  Its hard to even follow.  He went to extreme lengths.  The story is right out of a movie.  Good thing that ppl smarter than me prove that he's a fraud.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:55:19
perhaps but that viewpoint is under appreciating the power of the technology.  and even when it hit 800 billion market cap, thats still small compared to the global markets. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:09:07
An entire new type of economy is being built around crypto.  Huge money to be made.  Its a better system.  They can't crush or ruin it - only slow it down.  Which isn't too much of a bad thing right now as it gives more time for development
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:21:35
i think the amount of debt a student can borrow should be link to their expected entry level salary.  For most ppl thats 30-40k.  You shouldn't be able to borrow more than that.  And as you say the interests rates are bullshit, they should be practically nothing
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:29:48
about G20
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:27:25
yea I've noticed that too
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:59:02
its the most amazing drug and the worst.  haha
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:47:52
I think the FEAR gauge is at an ATH.  It certainly is for me and even most of the youtubers i've followed for a while seem fearful or basically like WTF this really could become a scary wipeout.  Perhaps this is good news 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:19:05
saw one almost everyday on Facebook during the Fall of 2017
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:24:15
ahh thanks for sharing!!  very hard times in this space mentally.  If I can hold through this and not sell I can see why the long term holders get rewarded.  Its a huge challenge .  My thesis has always been that long term you will always see another ATH, its just a question of how long/when, hopefully no more than a few years
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:33:33
yes its surreal to see it again.  great opportunity to accumulate more.    And if it goes down even more, even better
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:42:49
so far I'm still right haha
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:12:04
Hey i appreciate this response and agree for the most part.  If you say they are sitting on the sidelines and not waiting for sub 5/6k then what are they waiting for?  
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:21:59
Theres no way this is going down below 5k.  The genie is way more out of the bottle than when Mt. Gox happened as well as the infrastructure.  I really think the bottom is in.  Of course im willing to be totally wrong, but at these prices everything is fairly valued.  My brother in law last night told me his dream price was 3500.  Well, keep dreaming.  Perhaps we test a little bit of the 7's again but that's it.  The start of the next FOMO is going to be when all the money on the sidelines such as my brother in law realize that its not going lower.  
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:21:42
i remember showing my wife that same price but it was on its way down to 6k.  good to be back up here again!
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:40:46
we must be getting close to the scared shitless i use to be a genius now idiot holding bags stage.  that's about where my head is at.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:46:57
The thing that pisses me off the most about this sell off/bear market is that we are showing weakness in what we are fighting against.  Im not just in this to make money.  I want to try a new system of monetary policy.  F U to the Central Banks, Governments and Bank Bailouts.  Theres other reasons too i love Bitcoin, but that is the biggest use case
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:09:10
yes that's true
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:53:32
I disagree.  As the market cap increase so will the applications proliferate to allow for Merchants to accept Bitcoin/Crypto for payment.  It wouldn't surprise me that within 1-2 years you can easily buy a Car or House paid in Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:08:25
How was Bitcoin created?  What is the technology behind it that allows for it to exist?  Why is it Trusted?  Why is it secure?  
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:07:28
coming from someone who's studied this stuff i wouldn't be surprised if its true. I have a sheet somewhere on these dates. Dec.22nd of course and I think May 1st is an important one this year too
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:02:32
yikes.  Im optimistic but Crypto is still very confusing to most people and storage off exchange can be tricky.  I wonder if the infrastructure is strong enough yet.  So if stocks go down crypto could go down too, but then rebound quicker as better applications come out
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:09:19
The value is in the technology, just like this Internet we are communicating over, or that Email i just sent or that Facebook website i just used
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:28:58
theres a lot of reasons to think we've bottomed here.  id buy more if i could 
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:26:40
agree sub 5k would be a joke and insult to the people that were there when it was sub 5k - like me LOL
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:51:52
If Warren Buffet wanted to buy 100 billion of Bitcoin, he would be the biggest holder correct?  Perhaps the real opportunity is for us early adopters to get the biggest transfer of wealth if countries and mega-rich people start buying.  But idk, getting confused trying to wrap my head around all this Lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:33:27
good points.  And i would be using it if i wasn't so down in the money on it .  I always said eventually i will never have to cash in and instead spend it as is.  I think those possibilities will expand and mature during the next bubble cycle.  Maybe institutions will help stabilize the market at higher prices
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:45:20
good points I'm with ya man!
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:43:22
yes and I'm one of those people and i unfortunately also bought as high as 16800, but luckily my biggest investment was much lower.  So I'm up on some and down a lot on others.  In my experience through all the ups and downs anytime you are accumulating below the last ATH you will be solid in the long term.  But you have to also be really into the Tech and the applications that are being built on top of it, otherwise you will easily be Shaken out
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:59:50
muther f-ing a.  wtf.  enough of this awfulness.  Perhaps another scenario is better.  We keep on creeping down until there is an insane amount of volume and the price spikes up a crazy amount such as 2k in a day from lets say 5 or 6k
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:31:06
yes i agree it seems that they are going to let the market ride.  They claim that they weren't even worried when BTC was 20k.  kind of opens the door to at least new ATH's potentially this year...
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:20:10
Who's thinking we wake up to a 9 in front of the price? and who's thinking a 10?
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:19:58
thats true as well most ppl are total idiots at the age os 18.  I most definitely was one.  Im still an idiot.  But when you are 18 you have no concept of how much your life will change and your interests will change.  So i think another discussion should be putting off college for a few years.  As well, general education requirements should be illegal as its YOUR MONEY that your spending, and most of those credits are not going to help you financially
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:37:44
The good news is that they will be clearly hurting their revenue stream.  But i agree as legit companies like Coinbase can't advertise now.  Perhaps once more clear regulation is in place they will allow advertising again
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:59:04
and Nasdaq recovered 15 years later correct?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:03:17
absolutely, but i think at this point for that to happen there'd have to be a more negative news event.  Such as Tether actually being a scam or Senate hearing cracks down
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:50
not sure what's worse, The Stock market or Crypto.  Stocks have definitely peaked imo.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:45:33
The analyst Tom Lee was quoted saying it on CNBC today
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:20:28
ok but i think these changes could make it a lot harder to hit ATH's again.  hopefully I'm totally wrong
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:52:17
I'm just going off that Gizmodo article.  Theres like a list of 20 things that suggests he's Satoshi.  Apparently there's actual emails with him involved in the beginning?  however, the computer scientist ppl involved with Bitcoin all say its bullshit.  My pea brain obviously sides with them.  And perhaps the whole thing is a giant psych-op, but Wright does seem to know a lot about the industry whether or not he's a fraud.  Hopefully today he finally goes away
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:57:15
no its only able to go down to the like 8th decimal point and the total amount of bitcoin is 21 million
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:21:03
i agree that would be retarded.  It just amazes me how complicated his scheme is to lie about being satoshi.  He went to extreme lengths, and its pretty technical from my view, he is definitely highly knowledgable about the space
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:39:49
absolutely true but i bet they also bought back in and are down on their new positions.  And i bet that if they did sell it was only a portion.  Heck i wish i sold some but it doesn't really matter long term.  Also don't forget that the real investors in this space are the ones that want to use the technology.  The whole point is to not go back to Fiat EVER.  Making profits is awesome but using Bitcoin to buy a car would be even better.  You can't do that with Apple Stock

yea who knows perhaps he is a total scam. The final cost of mining idea is something new he is saying.  He has made compelling arguments as to why Bitcoin is valuable in the past.  Why at his age and bad health does he need publicity?  I tend to think that he's right about the future of bitcoin and crypto, But the dude is super controversial and famously sketchy . so who knows!
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:32:39
Lol,  ill be happily proved wrong, but would love to see Equities decline and crypto rise.  It would also make sense to have a bear market in equities after a 9 year bull run
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:08:59
i agree and hope so.  But i fear that the majority of ppl just don't care.  They work their jobs and raise kids etc...Especially the ppl who have good paying jobs.  They don't care if bitcoin succeeds or doesn't.  they make plenty of $ already and centralization or decentralization don't matter

@_date: 2018-03-30 13:38:12
my problem is i don't see how this can go to shit.  The technology has never failed or been hacked.  Its the longest running and most trusted blockchain.  What else could replace it?  And There are too many issues with Government issued crypto, i almost feel like they can't issue their own unless they peg it against a global crypto such as Bitcoin otherwise its just the same thing we have now with a different hat on
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:17:16
Perhaps but do you really think 20k was the Top?  If one thing is for sure, we all know it won't go to zero as that would of happened by now.  The next peak will be amazingly higher and so will the bottoms.  There has to be real value in bitcoin and others otherwise there's no way it would of ever hit 20k to begin with.  This stuff has got to bounce back...hopefully it doesn't take too long Lol
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:23:13
im thinking its going to be a surprise and its a 10
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:07:50
Guys if you want to be optimistic start looking into the applications being built on layer two solutions like lightning.  When i started investing it was not all about the potential gains.  It was more about the new type of economy/applicatoins its creating.  Mind boggling stuff and highly educational.  just awesome.  Total crypto market cap of 350 billion is a joke compared to what could be created with this technology.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:47:53
Oh wow this is so awesome!!! didn't know it existed
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:49:34
are you serious?  the banks got bailed out and they can print money and change interest rates.  besides that its not even federal, its a private institution.  
My work ethic has nothing to do with my beef with the Central Banks

@_date: 2018-02-05 23:57:42
great point. Watch it crash more and then long bear market...etc... and then all of a sudden some USE case comes along and its booming again.. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:52:09
sounds like a good thesis
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:53:53
i felt so smart buying at 7800 last weekend.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:50:51
Lol good point!  I just think the risk to reward below 6k is too good to pass up.  Hence I imagine there is a ton of buying pressure down there and we are close to the bottom...
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:57:27
you've been in Bitcoin since 2011 and are still here?  How are you not retired already?
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:54:53
how are you interpreting this?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:53:21
wow so now you can't advertise on google, youtube, and Facebook.  And you can't use credit card.  They are basically trying to shove crypto underground.  Next thing you know CNBC will ban talking about it
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:19:16
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:12:47
i mean that wouldn't surprise me the least.  Bakkt being delayed fits right into it.  Now the holidays will be strict No Crypto conversations, everybody forgets, ppl like me ask my parents for rent money Lol and the price keeps going lower cause retail can't take the uncertainty
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:53:18
Why is Google waiting until June to ban ads?  Doesn't really make sense as they could ban immediately
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:31:42
i agree this is my concern.  Shoving the industry underground.  But perhaps once clearer regulation is in place they will allow advertising again
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:49:10
Not only that they can start business's with no risk of going bankrupt and basically run companies through shell organizations and make the change they want to "see" or should i say control
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:24:02
i agree.  if this all works out ppl will be kicking themselves for not taking advantage of this opportunity .  I never thought we'd see these prices again.  Perhaps the last ATH was mainstream validity and a peak into the future.  Anybody who has ever sold Bitcoin has missed out on incredible gains over the long term.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:21:38
if the average cost to mine a bitcoin really is 8k id imagine its possible we are at the bottom here
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:35:39
well it was great timing but i kept buying and also i was 50/50 btc and eth, so down like 50% on that position
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:58:30
You say that there is zero use case currently but i don't think that's relevant right now.  As more people wake up to the significance of the technology the more use case's will arise.  Also because of this correction and the fact that it hit 20k means that the price on the way up could spike so fast you will miss out
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:21:02
WAIT I COULD BE RIGHT!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:55:50
hard to disagree with you after the G20 news and Congress report today.  Donald Trump mentioning crypto too is good.  If anything its a good time to buy some if you are completely on the sidelines.  They say don't try to catch a falling knife...well whats the opposite of that?  Trying to stop a Rocket?  Cause we could see some insane green candles on the way back up.  And they will be on the 1m or 5minute
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:34:33
true so what's the lowest cost to mine a bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:07:48
will know for sure whats happening soon if its does or doesn't crash harder
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:10:51
Ive come to the conclusion that HODL is total bullshit especially after watching this video.  I'll always have a long term stash of BTC with a time horizon of at least 3-5years from now, but once we get back over 10k, Ill be taking profits here and there and buying only if theres major corrections.  
Big money controls this market just like stocks.  They long/short it with leverage up to the wazoo.  There are ppl absolutely "Controlling" this market.  Long term i sincerely believe bitcoin will hit at least 50k+ but its no fun having to hold through a potential 1-3 year bear market when you had awesome profits.  
So I guess my point is I'm no longer a Newbie.  I have idealist views on the future of crypto, but the Money Gods like to kill ppl - sometimes literally by financially ruining ppl (not talking about myself , but i did over invest Lol).  Its a game of stealing money.  Pump it up, get new money in, and then steal it, rinse and repeat but TIME is the problem for normal investors.  Their decisions and games have a huge impact on the daily lives of ordinary ppl and its not ok.  
The SEC and CFTC are total bullshit.  Everybody is out to eat you.  It doesn't matter if you Believe in Bitcoin or Ethereum, they don't give two shits.  The Big Money players have ALL THE MONEY.  Mike Torntare(CBOE) admitted this yesterday too at consensus.  He said YOU need institutions cause WE have ALL THE MONEY.  
Anyway, if you are new to Bitcoin , this is for you.  Even though you are a long term believer and think Bitcoin is going to the Moon (I agree), there can be short term set backs that take years to recover from.  So once your money doubles or triples, make sure to take some off the table or you'll have to learn the hard way like me!  Good luck everybody and it looks like next year will be strong...

@_date: 2018-03-29 13:59:21
i know right ppl have to look at this as the next best opportunity to accumulate 
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:22:37
Agree.  id buy more if i could.  Crypto certainly is not dead.  This is actually kind of fun in a sick stomach churning way
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:56:35
No the wealth distribution will simply be a result of adoption by the population - the early adopters will be financially rewarded.  Just like early adopters of a successful company are - such as Apple.  The reason why it will be adopted is because Bitcoin is a technological invention as significant as the internet itself.  Its a better system and as the applications become more developed the general population will begin to realize that.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:23:18
everybody that has already sold thinks it won't hold.  And holders think it will hold.  Lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:38:34
yea started investing last May, and my plan was to hold at the very least a year.  Did not expect that run up, and i remember looking at it at 18k, thinking it was gonna go to 25k.  And if I had been holding since sub 1k, yes i would of sold some.  ok my logic is flawed Lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:24:57
we've all learned a valuable lesson.  I didn't think it would get as bad as 2013/2014 cause there's not a Mt. Gox moment and the infrastructure is much stronger.  But I will stick with history like you mention, as long as you hold for long term, historically speaking you will see another ATH.  We could be looking at the beginning of 2021 though for it to start up.  Fine by me cause i have 3 year old twins, so whether its sooner or even ten years from now, doesn't really matter
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:53:32
Do not take this seriously. Yes he's a Living legend and had his time but other than that completely USELESS. if you are into Bitcoin this guy is at the bottom of the list., actually he's not even on the list.  Nobody is consulting Wozniak about crypto.  He's just a spectator.  And for the record, total bullshit that he sold his bitcoin.  its frankly an insult to the community.  While I'm also bullish on other coins, i will always have at least some bitcoin, especially for the next 2-5 or Forever years
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:34:44
best case scenario is we find the bottom Soon.  otherwise, yes i agree crypto could get fucked for a few years.  I just can't see it happening though.  theres so much interest in this space.  its literally creating a new economy.  it would be so lame for it just to die.  
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:29:31
this looks promising if you haven't seen it yet.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:45:32
i thought that last week when i bought at 7800.  hopefully we are close to the f-ing bottom 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:22:22
man we all hope so!  This should definitely ignite something.  Living through financial history here and the majority of ppl still have no idea
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:58:47
Rumors of total market cap of crypto testing 300 billion before rebounding.   I personally think that's unlikely, but be prepared for it mentally
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:53:13
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:55:19
will be an interesting week for sure.  and perhaps it will go down more and that will be an even better opportunity .  However it also may not go down much more and hence IMO its better to dollar cost average a percentage of your money on a day like today.  The lightning will have more demand when the applications being built on it are ready for mainnet.  Its going to be a huge year in terms of developing on that - imo
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:58:31
no i know but whats the timescale they use for bitcoin - 1 year?  and whats it for Pulte and Nasdaq.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:40:29
Its a risk for sure, but i think the technology is too much of a game changer and am optimistically assuming it will be adopted as it becomes more fine - tuned.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:34:34
he's looking wrong by the minute Lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:16:56
GUYS -  Crypto Exists because it is something. It has become a CULTURAL TREND.  The market cap almost hit 1TRILLION.  The SMARTEST fucking computer engineers and programmers are 100% focused on developing this into an entire new economy.  An economy that is different from the current rules that this economy runs on.  Everybody thinks it has no intrinsic value but wtf this is TECHNOLOGY - breakthroughs in computer science.  Something is there.  It is worth 1 Trillion  
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:04:56
ahh interesting.  still sitting on the sidelines?  will be curious when you pull the trigger to get back in.  Im assuming this rally hasn't convinced you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:56:25
As Awful as this is., when it DOES come back. It will go up so fast that you won't be able to buy back in.  Exchanges will crash etc.  In some ways this experience is making me think my coins are even more valuable.

@_date: 2018-03-18 22:09:04

@_date: 2018-03-18 22:07:30
hell yea.  anybody who has ever sold bitcoin has regretted it (long term speaking).  I realize some people have to sell investments for unforeseen reasons but to sell Bitcoin out of panic is only if you don't understand the technology and the applications being built on it.  Don't buy something you don't understand and unfortunately many people have
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:57:03
its looking more and more like the last best opportunity to accumulate 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:55:48

@_date: 2018-03-14 18:21:43
This is a comment I'm quoting from someone who commented on a Coindesk article.  Curious on peoples thoughts.  I agree that if true they can only bring down the market so far.
"Options market closes at the end of the trading day Eastern time today March 14. They (Killer Whales, owners of the option exchange, and MTGox trustee) always short the options market and they have the control (bitcoin) to manipulate the market. Adoption is at about 9500, so they (the options controllers) have purposely gambled the price to a short using the option funds to pay for their losses. (They raised the margin to 44% to increase the ability to short deeper and still not lose.) But one thing is for sure, the Killer Whales have a LOT of bitcoin and cannot afford to CRASH the market. Fear selling below 8300 to 8500 will present incredible buy opportunities for the big guys or those in the know. I personally bought in at 8800 and will wait for what I believe will be the next two week run up toward 12K. This is my personal SWAG and individuals should not invest funds they cannot afford to burn. I am not a financial consultant and any risk should be based on your own due diligence"
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:12:05
while i can't predict the future, i will make a prediction based on my past experiences since the 1800 correction.  This will be the best time you will ever be able to accumulate bitcoin at these prices.

I hate to agree with this analyst but she's been really accurate predicting when it goes down.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:33:43
For a blockchain to succeed it has to be the most trusted, longest running and most secure.  Bitcoin is this.  It has never failed or been hacked.  It has the first mover network advantage.  I don't see how it can't succeed.  It doesn't have to become a currency, but as long as its a new asset class, i think a minimum of 1 trillion market cap is a reasonable valuation 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:25:51
this thought process makes perfect sense.  Why would bitcoin die now when it hasn't died already.  And whats the other option if it were to die?  Go back to the same old same old - federal reserves etc.  The world needs change and this technology has the power to change it
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:28:20
Everybody buying/selling because of the price, not the technology
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:40:17
can't disagree with this being a traders paradise, but its very unpredictable, hard to time, I'm in it for long term growth as i see the technology becoming adopted
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:10:23
I'm not sure. But I bet you Brian Armstrong and people that run exchanges, and Mike Novogratz. , etc. know what's up.  Also keep in mind that every youtube trader and other outspoken investors such as Ronnie Moas are publicly saying they are buying not selling at these levels.  Thats somewhat comforting...
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:57:25
why are you so unsure it won't at least come back to 15k?
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:58:31
the next FOMO is not going to be the neighbor next door stage.  Its all the investor type ppl that want to get into crypto and think its going sub 6k or 5k.  They want to brag how smart they are when it crashes hard again and they bought a ton.  Too bad they missed that stage and will have to accept they are only as smart as the current price and missed a great opportunity last summer.  They will soon realize that this is the best entry point.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:30:11
very cool thanks for sharing
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:56:40
its market cap is so small right now compared to the global markets that even at 20k the G20 said Bitcoin wasn't a concern.  Its also becoming clearer to the finance world that it would be unwise to not have at least 1% exposure to Bitcoin.  Its the perfect hedge to our current system.  In addition, the symbology and technology and the power of holding Bitcoin in your possession in your private keys is being completely undervalued and under appreciated.  And once its in cold storage you have no risk to computer or phone hack or some other catastrophe.  
In addition Currencies don't have a fixed price.  The dollar for example is down over 15% since Trump took office.  As the market for crypto and Bitcoin mature/increase the volatility will diminish and it will behave more like a typical currency.

The higher the Market cap the higher the Tax Revenue.  Its the Greatest Transfer of Wealth for both Citizens (mainly early adopters) and Governments.  AS the market cap of crypto grows Countries may change their stance as they see it as an opportunity out of their current mess.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:35:04
This is an important point but i would argue its the wrong mindset.  With this mind set you will be a User of the Technology but will not benefit from it financially.  As the market matures the volatility will decrease.  You could compare it to early investors in Apple getting rich , while we all use smart phones but did not get wealthy from the technology.

but truthfully nobody knows...still lots of uncertainty out there.  This technology is so disruptive.  Banks banning credit card purchases, Facebook banning ads.  Its a war, game of thrones style.  I will say that the other corrections I've been through lasted painfully long, and sometimes the price stayed in a tight range for a week or two.  Its also a long way up back to 20k and super psychology trading games are going to be played.   Its true that they say only play with money that would suck if you lost, but you would still be able to pay your bills and at least keep your current standard of living

GUYS IT WILL HOLD SUPPORT.  The Traders are playing their games but they will not let it break 7500/8k.  Sorry if you missed out on buying Bitcoin at 3k or 5k., i know you are sad, go get a hug and hopefully you can come to the realization that these prices are a GIFT.  We are living through History in the making.  Its awesome and so much fun.  Be thankful that you even have a position, as its still less than 3% of the population.  This is a CULTURAL TREND that is UNSTOPPABLE.

Thanks for sharing as I was just thinking about this.  How are tethers created.  Who invented it, and what is the process to create it?  How many different exchanges accept it?  It seems that OKeX does the most volume
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:28:43
He also has said in other interviews this is a very conservative prediction.  I'd say two years its 25k
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:34:29
This also means that legit companies like Coinbase can't advertise which in my opinion will slow down adoption.  In addition Google really fucked over YouTuber's with their new algorithms.  Lots of them are pissed off and looking at Steem and D.tube.  Perhaps long run though this is awesome as we've had enough of the Censorship BS and Crypto will do what its designed for - Censorship Resistant
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:41:27
The whole video is worth watching.  legit people in the industry giving their insight
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:43:30
Most ppl won't get rich off of crypto because by the time they start buying it the market will be much more established.  You also have to look at it from a different perspective as the average person couldn't invest in Facebook pre-IPO.  With Bitcoin or other Crypto, almost anybody can invest.  The club is not as private anymore.  The Gate keepers are not as relevant 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:55:41
I hate to cave in and say a bear market is here, but I'm not sure how this will miraculously turn around.  I think the fact that you can't advertise Crypto now and buy with a  credit card make this market completely different from how it was before the ATH of 20k
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:30:54
Don't worry everybody John Mcafee confirmed yesterday that he stands by his bet.  The guy is nuts but he makes legit reasons as to why bitcoin will become worth 500k-1mil. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:15:49
He is so smart that he didn't invest in AMAZON OR FACEBOOK.  this is an old dog who not surprising is out of touch with the future.  And by the way, he is also a fraud.  Nobody eats Ice Cream for breakfast, snacks on potato sticks and drinks 5 cokes a day, and lives to 80 and has teeth.  He clearly lies to the world to market the companies he invests in.  It's unbelievable he is not called out more for his "show"
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:54:18
Bitcoin is the first successful digital currency implemented on the Blockchain.  IMO everything else being invented (smart contracts other crypto's) can only succeed/exists because of Bitcoin's success.    Blockchain is of course going to/is changing everything but as long as BTC never fails, its a no brainer to invest for long term 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:32:07
if you have money on the sidelines and have not bought at least a little right now you are crazy.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:52:59
agree although if this works out Apple maybe too small of a comparison haha
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:47:02
yea not looking good right now
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:24:12
its a realistic scenario and I'm trying to inject some positivity 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:02:27
It was the Whales who drove the price up and down.  Retail Investors did FOMO in, but a very small percentage.  I base this analysis on my real life.  I've told many people to invest but my success rate is only 5%.   Also the Stock Market has PEAKED and Bitcoin has BOTTOMED.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:10:16
BTC is the first successful form of Digital Money.  This has never happened in history.  Why would any new investor buy something like DASh when BTC is clearly the first crypto anybody will buy.  I'm not saying other crypto's like Dash Monero, etc., are not awesome too, its just that the average person, won't get that sophisticated, and start with BTC and maybe that's it for a few years.
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:08:18
i don't know anything about charting., but the fact that the prices held through the night must be a good sign...
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:34:36
Lol i felt the same way when i started buying back in May but was still buying when it was 16k.  In my experience any time you are accumulating below its last ATH is a great entry.  I doubt we will be back to ATH in a month.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:14:39
yea seriously
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:23:01
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:31:24
This is the most informative and important post.  If anybody has ties to World Crypto Network they should do a whole show on his.  Seriously everything is black and white now to me.  Btw don't forget to mention LARRY SUMMERS!!!  He is the advisor to DCG!  Him being a part says it all!
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:42:19
while thats partly true, the people who will become wealthy are in it for the technology 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:53:27
Haha! good points!
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:15:44
no way this is true, that would mean you are a perfect trader and timed the bottom and top perfectly.  Just not possible.  Lying it not a good thing for your karma
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:27:03
hope this helps anybody who was scared during this downtrend, or is questioning investing.  Use this thesis as the foundation of your investment thesis and you will be all set.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:20:38
ok so 27 exchanges accept Tether?  That would mean they are all in on it?
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:31:34
I think the most important part about DCG is look who is on the Board of Advisors... Larry Summers!  That says it all!
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:39:12
Larry Summers supports 2X... enough said
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:30:11
I think this is bad for Crypto.  While it saves people from scams, it also prevents legit services Like Coinbase from advertising which brings public awareness.  Feels like they are trying to shove this underground as deep as possible
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:35:12
so ppl can be scammed until June?
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:53:38
nuts im wrong
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:31:25
love it thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:29:11
i believe regulation will be seen as a positive because many institutions and investment funds need it as they deal with other peoples money
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:03:14
I wonder too whats gonna happen.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:41:39
yes like myself
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:22:26
Ive heard enough of these dreams of buying Bitcoin below 5k, 3k.  Sorry people missed out.  Now is your next best opportunity.  Bitcoin has bottomed, its an unstoppable TREND.  
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:00:28
great points and I'm with you...just reminds me to be careful how much i invest, or maybe to get a second mortgage lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:10:16

@_date: 2018-03-19 14:31:17
i wouldn't blame them but in that case i would say they don't believe/understand the technology, its potential, and why governments may ultimately have to have a position in crypto.  Its highly volatile now but as the market grows and matures it will become less of an issue.  The ride up to 100k though will be extremely volatile.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:06:18
damn your on to me
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:46:29
Lots of discussion about how the top 1% own 40% of coins. I don't see how this is relevant.  Like how would this not happen?  Everybody in the World gets air dropped the same amount of coins?  Its just the way markets and capitalism work.  Just my opinion, maybe I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:48:41
he's causing a lot of confusion with being fanatical about his BCH, and is pro 2x.  He's not helping adoption by making ppl confused
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:25:58
it will be denominated in Satoshis.  You know that right?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:38:27
Guys This is the WAR stage.  This has happened before at 3k and 5k and lots more below those prices before i was involved.  This is what will prove that this is the support.  The Charts can not explain this..., Its bloody out there.  Send out the FREQUENCY that you believe in this.   Ignore anything else.  Believe like its your FAITH.  Do not be SCARED.  NO FEAR!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:46:01
The Illuminati is obsessed with the number 7.  Remember that Christine Langrade IMF chief video where she talks about the Number 7?  The code word is 7k ---  buy at 7
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:38:31
so you'd prefer a centralized digital currency., like a FedCoin or something?  I dont see what another option is
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:06:11
that's surprising to hear as i don't know anybody looking to get in.  but great news!  lucky them! 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:24:02
Absolutely agree.  And for the average joe like myself, Coinbase and Gemini are the only reason I started investing 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:16:42
Not sure i can agree with your Thesis .  There are just too many forces at play.  Major money players got involved with Crypto this past Fall.  This correction makes a ton of sense.  Especially if it holds
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:50:18
i like posts like this
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:40:38
I believe It's an invention because ppl Trust it enough to trade in their Fiat for it.  Sure speculation is rampant but the majority of ppl are hodling and they most likely will never convert back into Fiat by the time they are ready to cash out.  You won't need to.  In a few years it will be super easy to buy anything with BTC and heck maybe even get a discount off price by using it
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:48:20
good point haha
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:21:51
of course not, thats why its still early.  There's a risk to invest but great reward.  Once the Wallets/Apps/infrastructure/etc. get built out more I think adoption will become more prevalent.   The User growth curve for a company like Facebook could be a comparison.  IF that were to happen now the difference would be that anybody who participates on the App/Platform would be rewarded financially. Unlike today where only investors or them selling your data gets rewarded.  As a participant in the new tokened economy you are an investor/user/and controller of your data.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:39:20
oh yea duh!
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:25:08
i said last night 8k is the new bottom and am standing by it.  Looking forward to getting off my computer soon for the day and waking up tomorrow to a price of at least 8250 and then ill watch it spike to 8790 tomorrow and break into 9k on Sunday
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:32:53
I mean Tether fails, and an exchange fails or something like that.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:58:37
New rules are being written.  The people have more power over this market than traditional markets.  8k will hold
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:06:05
well...i won't disagree completely with this.  there is some occultic shit going on this world for sure.  I mean the freaking IMF Christine Lagrade is giving a speech using Numerology??  Like wake the fuck up people, if you think that is just like whatever you have no idea what is going on.  IMF chief should only speak about ECONOMIC factors not NUMEROLOGY.  You would only speak like that if its real other wise you are unqualified for the position.  Btw, I majored in Economics
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:06:54
I agree and hopefully you are right.  I just can't see them letting price get too high.  But then again they are very distracted and have bigger issues on their hand like the balance sheet and interest rates.  So perhaps the beaurachacy of government will be too slow to react
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:50:52
haha well def not if they bought back in down here.  hindsight is 20/20. Also depending on your income bracket, the taxes might not of been worth it if 6 months later it hits 40k and you have to stress about when to buy back in.  I know if I had personally sold at say 18k, i would of definitely bought back in at 10k.  Then Id owe income tax versus capital gains, when if i had not sold and waited a year just capital gains.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:48:25
not seeing BCH as an option
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:35:40
I hope ppl in the discussion are not paying $60k (college) a year for it.  IF so they will regret not putting $60k a year into BTC. And This is coming from an Economics major 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:35:36
Lol just to start a discussion.  If he was saying that having Bitcoin Cash is good for Bitcoin that'd be one thing, but he is promoting it like its the original chain
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:03:37
100% agree with you.  The next FOMO is going to be so insane and in my opinion its going to start with all the people that are losing interest and hope right now.  They are going to start it once they realize its not going to go down again.  Also There is so much momentum building behind the scenes - like the the infrastructure and tech development.  THat's the shit that really matters, not the speculative price.  Congrats on getting into crypto before me and see you on the the other side of 100k...
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:57:42
gotcha thanks
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:21:21
HAHA!  oh man i guess you are British?  Don't even get me started on the Royal family.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:14:13
hope so for you too, anybody that is strong enough to hold til then, should be rewarded.  its not going to be easy....
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:32:17
ok interesting, its a very complicated issue.  But no matter, your money is either in Bitcoin or Tether correct?  Bitcoin is TRUTH and Tether may not be truth.  So the real risk is exchange failure Correct?
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:38:18
Currently he's out promoting that BCH has more Users than BTC.  That's not lying?
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:50:31
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:07:21
gotcha good point
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:09:09
clearly going lower, what have you been thinking is a realistic low
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:23:09
look at his face expressions plus its scripted, anybody can see this
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:01:57
yes she's right
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:54:18

@_date: 2018-03-14 18:20:13
i agree, at the same time are they not smart enough to figure out the legit ads versus scams?  Such as Regulated exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:53:05
How about this analysis .  Bitcoin/Crypto gets mentioned during Superbowl either via an Ad, a broadcaster or during Halftime show
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:06:16
what i mean is that crypto could get mentioned and we get a nice bump up because of it
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:49:54
but i see history in the making unfolding in front of our eyes.  This is the perfect storm at the perfect time.  This is why Bitcoin was invented
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:22:15
keep in mind that this was 7 months before the collapse.  There were already concerns with ppl not being able to get their money out, and they kept on getting new money in for another 7 months.  Roger Ver was promoting the ponzi scheme of Mt. Gox and clearly had inside info.  I mean its clear he is reading off a script
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:26:06
It's obvious he's lying in this video.  I've always had a talent for reading ppl and regards to Roger Ver, his tune on BTC changed a lot after 2013 based on my preliminary research.  Not that interested in pursuing it further, but perhaps he lost money at Mt. Gox, or was even involved.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:34:46
yea gotcha but to let ads run their course that are scams when they are trying to protect consumers?  it should be effective immediately 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:26:05
because they control the interest rates and supply.  Also our government bailed out the banks.  They all live at the top above the laws.  they make the laws.  its a total joke to them.  But unfortunately there is also most likely rampant manipulation in crypto and the exchanges run fractional reserve as well.  So maybe neither is correct
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:39:32
Gemini released all customers bcash last week.  Problem is how do you sell it?  What exchanges for ppl based in US allow bcash deposits and exchanges? I'm getting confused trying to figure out
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:44:56
you don't want me spreading the truth?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:25:59
a price of 6k-7k is perfectly reasonable for this technology IMO, i think undervalued, but what do i know
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:18:13
No this is scenario would be fact.  Theres been tons of times that Coinbase and other exchanges Freeze on high volume
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:57:15
i didn't really mean all the exchanges., but some for sure
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:46:29
I think the current Bcash price is simply fake, and being held up by one mining company and also the fact is most ppl didn't even get their Bcash yet cause its confusing to split their coins or their coins are still on an exchange.  If Coinbase or the other exchanges release their Bcash in January, that's when we will know its true price.  But also they might release them and still not support exchanging them, so it would be a mess for most ppl.   and the few exchanges that will support bcash will have problems as a result 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:53:11
It does seem that BCash is being pushed more in Asian countries. perhaps Alibaba is in on it too
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:32:25
it was invented for a reason
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:39:48
Ill be the first to say it - I think we bottomed. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:02:32
Definitely not my only argument but my foundation for investing in it when trying to explain to other ppl why they should take a serious look at investing.   IMO Can't compare it to other technological inventions that became replaced with something better because BTC is MONEY.  Sure there will be better/are other cryptos, but to believe in DIGITAL MONEY not backed by a government is such a big invention, historical paradigm shift,  that even if Bitcoin in the long run is considered the Myspace of crypto, it will still be worth over 100k, and a solid store of DIGITAL VALUE (Money).  The other cryptos will have better use cases, but you will easily be able to switch you BTC into others
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:13:34
I haven't gotten through your Thesis yet, but I find it hard to believe Tether could pump the market that hard. I just think the numbers are too big.  but could be wrong
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:41:32
actually i read about this in Forbes and have been looking to get one!
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:50:03
so many people sitting in Fiat waiting for that Bullish engulfing candle.  That perhaps the bullish engulfing candle comes not on a drop off down to 6k or 5k but some white swan event of an ETF getting approved or some awesome regulatory news or another country legalizing bitcoin or something and next thing you know everybody is FOMO-ing
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:47:27
Lol, yes smartest to get in now.  what i mean is most people i know are just staying away now, can't handle it.  id be buying too if i was looking to add to my position
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:45:50
cool thanks, heard of that, will look into it thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:01:12
what i means is that if you keep your coins in Cold Storage and HOLD through this insanity, when it DOES come back, you will laugh at everybody Trying to Buy but the exchanges will be freezing and you won't be able to buy and will miss out on the insane gains
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:33:14
Lol yea its already breaking 8300
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:36:22
Lol, right on, love the analysis.  I agree, wish i sold everything at 18k, then bought back in now.  At the next peak i will likely sell some and then buy back in.  But its also very hard to time.  For example i didn't think it would break 10k, and next thing you know its 6500.  
Perhaps best strategy is to sell 30% of your position at each peak and buy back in during crashes
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:22:36
great post.  i sure as hell don't understand lightning but the developer community obviously built it for a reason and You understand its potential and are using it.  that's music to my ears
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:04:39
yes but the flaw in this argument is Cisco is not a good comparison.  In fact there is no historical comparison to Bitcoin/crypto in general.  This technology has the ability to create a new type of economy with new rules.  BETTER rules.   The more adopted the technology becomes, the more stable.  While it may take a few years for everything to come back, its also quite possible that a viral DAPP or LAPP gets released this year.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:22:05
I just think its interesting that you are in complete control of your funds and can store or send it anywhere. But of course to cash it in you do need a bank!   Im not totally against banks, more thinking about what the technology allows.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:37:44
Its the most TRUSTED.  that is crucial in this game changing technology.  It also has the ability to grow and change.  Im super bullish on Ethereum too, but Bitcoin will always be the most Trusted in Crypto.  It was first and has the biggest network effect.  Its not possible for any other coin to beat this unless a part  of the bitcoin technology/code fails
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:48:50
Awesome thanks for your reply!
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:05:33
this is really interesting, curious, where did you buy it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:41:15
perhaps, but we are Talking about Money.  Its the first time in history that people have an option outside of the control of Federal Reserve, banking, governments, etc.  Bitcoin can and is being improved upon, just like the iPod.  It also has the first mover advantage and biggest network affect.  Most importantly because it is Money,  TRUST is the biggest issue.  It has stood the test of time and not failed.  Forks provide alternative use cases, but Trust and security that has been proven over time are crucial. IMO
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:39:48
So far Bitcoin follows a somewhat predictable path of ups and downs.  It seems to always retrace parabolic moves before rising again.  If this happens to stocks/Dow I'm thinking its gonna go back to 17/18k?  
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:00:58
my biggest concern is Coinbase or Gemini getting shut down
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:30:26
I like this post!  great perspective
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:51:04
yea i guess there is no way to stop it, hopefully I'm just over thinking it
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:22:54
The primary reason for the explosion in Bitcoin price this year is the Exchanges!  Especially Coinbase.  So if ppl want the price to continue to rise the y need to stick around, otherwise it will only be worth $2k o something like that
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:01:32
its a positive and a new on-ramp, but until the FEAR is out of here and bottom is officially established..thats all that matters.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:56:08
ahh interesting.  So they'd have to buy a shit ton of BTC and will probably have to buy on the exchanges?  It sounds like the OTC market is drying up
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:48:58
Thanks for the reply and great point.  But how would all the countries come to an agreement?  I don't see it ever happening.  Who would be the country securing the blockchain?  
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:01:56
nicely worded.  seems like an accurate prediction
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:02:10
I bet Novogratz is lying that Institutions are waiting for a name like Fidelity to offer custody.  Crypto is a brand new industry. It would make perfect sense to trust Coinbase over any legacy banking company. Coinbase Custody could be a huge success
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:24:42
Perhaps that's true, but he is taking advantage of ppl and the world treats him like a genius and great person.  I take issue with him promoting unhealthy products on ppl that unfortunately don't get a good education on healthy eating to know better.

@_date: 2018-03-30 11:34:49
i agree and this is part of my investment thesis. This shit is still in pre-take off mode.  Frankly i can't believe that now I have another opportunity to accumulate more down at these prices.  If it goes lower even more insane.  We must be close to the bottom though
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:06:40
why you don't agree?
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:52:10
Great points, My biggest concern is when will The US Fed Reserve threaten Bitcoin on national television.  Realistically imagine Janet Yellen saying, "Bitcoin is making our policies, interest adjustments, etc., less Effective...."  Hopefully I'm totally over thinking this scenario, and if it does eventually happen it won't be until price is much higher
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:34:36
yes but as i mention below, your money is either in Tether or Bitcoin.  So if Tether fails you lose your Tether, not your Bitcoin.  Unless an exchange that supports Tether fails, than who knows what happens but thats why you don't keep your money on exchanges.  correct?
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:59:32
what if he lost it?
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:17:13
I know right total BS.  And looks like we are heading back up, which has been my prediction.  Chart looks exactly like the dip in July.  So another few days of steady gains and then back over 4100 we are golden
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:46:43
haha so true!  As hard as this correction has been to stomach, i think its going to be just as hard when to sell.  Most ppl did not think 20k was the top, thought it would hit 25/30k before retracing.  What's going to be the next top?  Kind of scares me, i would hate to sell at 50k and then watch it hit 100k, but then again it will also have a major correction after the next run
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:45:15
I went to bed last night convinced it was another bull trap., and we'd be at 6k., and eventually all the way back down to 2k.  and two year bear market. Crypto dead., etc.  Sitting in bed this morning afraid to get up and check price.  Im blown away, this is the most amazing thing to see.  Mother F-ing YEA!  Congrats to all the HOLDERS!
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:48:17
HAHAHA!  thats true of course.  but lets say i buy on Exchange, store in a hardware wallet for two years, swap it for ETH, the LTC and then send that to the exchange and sell it for Fiat.  Will exchanges care?  I mean it would be stifling for the industry if you needed to prove everything you did with your coins anytime you sell for fiat
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:58:17
8% of the amount?  that'd be $80 per 1k?
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:24:13
so the industry is just going to shrink and the exchanges will start to close and the price will never be great than it is today? The whole thing will just turn into a big joke?
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:02:32
Definitely not my only argument but my foundation for investing in it when trying to explain to other ppl why they should take a serious look at investing.   IMO Can't compare it to other technological inventions that became replaced with something better because BTC is MONEY.  Sure there will be better/are other cryptos, but to believe in DIGITAL MONEY not backed by a government is such a big invention, historical paradigm shift,  that even if Bitcoin in the long run is considered the Myspace of crypto, it will still be worth over 100k, and a solid store of DIGITAL VALUE (Money).  The other cryptos will have better use cases, but you will easily be able to switch you BTC into others
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:09:33
Guys don't worry , do you think the Winklevoss Twins are happy with only 1 billion?  Ha!  no way,  when they are worth 100 billion, thats when you take profits
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:33:07
yes i do.  I was buying last summer and there were two significant corrections before breaking out of 5k.  The only thing wasn't tested was a return to the 4900-ish level.  While its possible we test that, there are so many buyers down there it could cause a huge bounce.  Also, Bitcoin is very unpredictable in that you can use all the TA in the world, but event driven news would trump it.  There's been a lot of positive news lately, whether its segwit adoption, infrastructure, index tracking etc.  So IMO something really positive will happen at some point in the next 1-6 months that at the very least proves where the floor is
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:50:34
actually looks like its listed
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:41:03
Have you experienced a time when your exchange has froze buying or selling?
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:06:49
yea but if they buy it OTC it doesn't affect the price right?  So if everybody buys the ETF how does the BTC price get affected?  Its all so confusing
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:43:49
There's a list of all bitcoin public address's and the most anyone has is 120,000.  Then a few have 100k and drops off from there.  Forget where the list is, sure you can find on google.   So they prob have 100k bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:36
also its much easier for crypto to double from these prices while everybody freaking out about equities and then another FOMO event occurs
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:14:50
so if you hate Bitcoin why are you here?  Wouldn't a traditional stock reddit thread be better?
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:36:16
I imagine the powers that rule Monetary policy don't want an ETF.  It legitimizes a new asset class, industry and a technology that makes central banks irrelevant.  Its amazing feeling when you have coins in cold storage and Bank of America or Merril Lynch has nothing to do with it
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:46:59
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:24:34
Hey I have a general question I'm hoping someone could shed light on.  If you have your BTC in cold storage with a legacy address and never change to Segwit  address , and then Bitcoin splits again etc., can you always use the Legacy address?  I'm assuming yes you can? But  you will just pay a higher transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:07:21
yea but i bet they make way more when its going up.  
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:45:02
How would a Bitcoin ETF affect the scarcity value thesis of Bitcoin itself?  I mean if you buy the ETF you don't ever have to deal with storing or using it, but would get any price appreciation/depreciation.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:55:01
With Larry Summers being an advisor to DCG, perhaps literally this fork is all about discrediting bitcoin/making it unstable to destroy it and make it ultimately not worth much/scare anybody from investing
@_date: 2018-07-12 02:56:41
these are the kind of interviews that got me excited to buy Bitcoin in the first place. Don't buy Bitcoin just because of price appreciation.  Understand the history of monetary policy and how it works today and why the invention of Bitcoin is important   
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:22:24
they just want the fee's correct?
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:35:24
Could you share -- How was your experience spending it?  What wallet do you use and where did you send it to and what did you buy?

Its weird i feel like all the ppl that woke up to this technology have already bought.  Im sure they will wake up once it comes back though 
@_date: 2018-07-13 14:13:14
makes sense to me.  The monthly is in a pretty tight range and I imagine the more days the price stays above 6k or even 5800 the better the chances that the bottom is in and all the pompous entitled finance guys who think they are so smart cause they are going to load up once it goes back to 5k or lower will have to buy in at these prices.  Would like nothing more than for people like ElErian and others to totally miss out
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:41:26
Crypto is DONE because Coinbase only made 1 Billion in revenue last year and this year they want to go out of business.  Tired of making so much money
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:23:30
i find it hard to believe BTC is going to die at this point.  Huge amounts of money has been invested.  Coinbase, Gemini, other exchanges, miners, conferences, etc.  Maybe the price crashes and gets super scary but i see it from the perspective that its the birth of a new industry 
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:11:32
thats a great idea 
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:13:50
this is interesting, appreciate you guys talking about this, and cool hearing from an actual miner what they think about BCash
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:20:18
perhaps this is a dumb question but if you haven't updated the 1.4.1 yet, do you need to do two updates or does the 1.4.2 do both?
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:47:13
perhaps this Bcash pump is going to flow into BTC.  whoever is pumping it is using it as a way to get money into crypto without making BTC sky rocket but eventually it will flip over.  Or there is some insider info going on and the 32MB block increase is popular?  Outside of Traders who are just looking for make a quick buck, I've never talked to anybody who is pro-bcash.  Sorry to even bring this up here - just looking for opinions
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:15:00
My experience in Bitcoin is the best time to buy is when its correcting/below its last ATH.  There is no good reason to think this time is any different.  If I had any disposable income left i would at the very lest DCA right now on a weekly basis all the way up to 12-15k lets say. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:58:56
thanks man i appreciate your response.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:36:40
so you think its BS?  I always questioned the rise to 20k being mainly retail but instead an obvious pump and then dump.  I still don't know many people who are into Bitcoin.  Like maybe 1% of ppl i know.  In many ways Bitcoin is designed to destroy all other Fiat so perhaps they will try/are trying to destroy Bitcoin but will fail because they can not control it like another asset such as Gold
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:31:57
just awful i see no real bottom anymore other than like 1k
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:56:28
right , but a bull run will generate massive fees...

whatever the case may be, i don't listening to anybody who is promoting and ICO including Mcafee.  All Im saying is i've watched every interview i could find of him since i started in this space about a year ago and the guy makes a lot of valid points about the technology, its potential, its implications, why it will be adopted, why its better than our current system, why they can't shut it down, etc.  The Guy knows what he's talking about but he's also just one source amongst many

Curious on ppl's thoughts about perhaps an overlooked risk of holding your own private keys.  So lets say you buy some bitcoin, put on a Ledger/Trezor/whatever and store for a few years.  Then you decide to sell it and log into an exchange like coinbase and send the bitcoin there.  Now lets say stricter regulation comes into play over the next few years and Coinbase asks you (even though you originally bought on Coinbase) where the coins are from.  Is this something the FAFTA news could cause?  Or is this an unrealistic scenario?  And if this is a concern wouldn't it make sense to keep at least some funds on an exchange?
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:56:48
I have the Ledger.  Curious if you've done the Firmware update on it and if it went smoothly?

the ride to 100k will probably be the most insane thing ever.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:05:01
typical.  how about talk about why Bitcoin was invented.  What problems it solves.  What are its potential use cases.  Why could it make business's and industries more efficient.  This is just like CNBC - its all about the price and stupid stories.  No substance
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:40:46
ahh good point.  so he needs to make it pass ATH's, have a huge FOMO event and then shit gonna get crazy?
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:15:22
I imagine if it goes back to 12-15k many ppl will start buying again
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:54:49
what i mean is it has the same value globally whereas 1 dollar does not equal 1 rupee and there is no exchange of different types of Fiat
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:47:27
thanks for reply.  Seems relatively easy to get setup to sell coins.  I wonder though if there is enough demand for the service in my area to be worth my time.  I think when most ppl make the decision to buy its much easier just to sign up for an Exchange
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:09:35
i don't take him totally seriously but he always brings up good points and seems to have a feel on the industry
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:54:09
IMO its a bad idea to sell everything.  The value of 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin to anybody in the world regardless of anybody's government.  Lets' say you hold on for 4 years and Bitcoin becomes worth 100k.  Perhaps by then the Indian Government will change its stance, or worst case you could go on an awesome vacation to Crypto friendly countries.  They can't stop you from going to another country and spending your Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:55:45
hes a Business man and a computer programmer.  What about the guys on CNBC, you don't think they get paid to shill stocks?
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:39:42
so true and can't argue with somebody who's been in way longer than me.  3 years ago I was a newbie to investing in general.  I finally had some extra money and bought great stocks Amazon 350, BABA at 70, Apple at 90, Facebook 75, Visa 64, Boeing 125 and a few others.  Unfortunately i panic sold after 6 months and wound up losing about 4 grand.  Since then I've watched those stocks go on to double and more.  After learning that lesson I decided that any extra money was better spent on paying down my mortgage as stocks were getting too high and i thought pre-paying my mortgage was the safest bet (even though I know many ppl disagree).  
Anyway fast forward to May 2017 and Bitcoin popped up on my radar.  I didn't understand it when I originally heard about it in 2013 but for some reason it started to interest me last May and i dug into the tech, significance etc.  It became super obvious to start accumulating and I swore to myself I will not panic sell and my time frame is a minimum 1-4years.  Who knew the first year would be the hardest, but i don't see any reason why it won't eventually surpass last ATH, perhaps its this year.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:55:18
100% agree with you that the speculative phase precedes the adoption phase.  and this market is a traders wet dream.  But wouldn't you agree then or that logically they will pump up once again pass 19k and then another crazy crash?  I imagine theres more money to be made if it bubbles again versus either going sideways for 1-2 years or even bringing it lower.  But if they do bring it lower i feel like it will still pump up pass 19k
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:20:44
Id love for somebody to tear this apart: 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:31:50
i think the low volume is cause of tons of money waiting on the sidelines for one more big drop.  It could come creeping back in if the drop doesn't happen or if some good news comes out
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:35:13

@_date: 2018-04-05 13:34:08
So you think 6100 is a great buy in ?  don't think its going sub-5k?
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:28:56
i like the logic lets hope it pans out 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:11:38
thanks for reply good points.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:54:08
see i disagree that everybody invested on the ride to 20k.  Out of lets say 100ppl i told about Crypto over last summer, i can only count 4 ppl who bought.  And a lot of them sold once their money doubled, cause they just speculated on it and never understood it.  I think once the price clearly stabilizes and creeps back up to lets say 15k, we could have the next biggest FOMO, but it won't necessarily be your next door neighbor. More like the infamous institutional money
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:08:19
I'm more optimistic , i think we will be closer or above 100k by the next halving.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:37:40
You don't buy Bitcoin because of the price, you buy because you understand and are a fan of the technology.  The price and potential financial gains of being an early adopter are just a result of being an early adopter. Late Adopters get the benefit not the gains.  If you understand this then you can survive the storms and will be more comfortable with your capital risk tolerance
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:11:43
when i got involved it was because of the technology, its implications, problems it solves, why its better than current systems, who the players in the game are, what they are saying, what they are doing.  I personally don't think its a scam and feel that we are witnessing the birth of a new gigantic industry.  I don't rule out more pain before gain though.  While i wouldn't recommend taking a mortgage out, i think putting 500-1k for long term few years is a no brainer
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:51:20
agree, this is an issue.  Crypto type banks need to exist.  Perhaps its companies like Coinbase or Gemini.  Or perhaps traditional banks will eventually have custodian services.

what has he done to further the industry other than claim to be Satoshi?  Its a joke.  I can't believe any conference invites him to speak.  That's the irony, why is anybody taking him seriously
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:11:00
I just read the first one and its the kind of stuff that renews my interest.  People that provide content need to get paid.  Major news corporations need to get paid too.  Nobody wants to subscribe to the NY Times, but they do want to read specific articles. Or What if you had to pay .25 cents to watch your favorite YouTubers daily video? would you? Micro payments could be a huge catalyst and use case for the Crypto market in general
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:44:22
very true.  But he's an old man, poor health, what does he have to gain?  That interview is just about the industry in general, no specific coin other than the obvious Bitcoin.  Does he really want to die and be looked back on as a total joke?  His past - the whole murder thing., yes totally crazy.  But he says things in interviews that seem spot on.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:21:35
so you think i should sell?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:47:29
you must of bought on pure speculation.  Only buy once you understand the tech and potential.  after that continually do research to justify the long term viability and watch as many interviews of ppl in the industry.  Otherwise you will indeed think its going to 1k and lower and is worthless and panic sell.  This correction is coming to an end, it will slowly rebuild.  The Point is if you don't think Bitcoin is awesome and have a general understanding of it, then don't buy.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:58:36
ok it doesn't have to hit 100k ., but passing ATH's is a great place to start.  
The world hasn't moved on, its just getting started and the ATH was the mainstream breakthrough.  Now we are in the digestion phase but soon the Bitcoin Monster will be hungry again for eating Fiat and the next rise will occur.  Then he will take another big ass dump.  Then he will eat again and eventually the market will be at more stable prices.
If they wanted to Forget about you then Why is CNBC doing Segments every night about Bitcoin on Fast Money?  Why do they show the price of Bitcoin throughout the show?  Why has Brian Kelly publicly stated he's All In.  Why are newspapers and other biz magazines starting to quote the bitcoin price in the Finance sections?
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:50:37
my experience is always buy whenever its below ATH's.  once it gets back up time to stop buying and take the ride.  Perhaps this time take some profits but maybe always keep a long term stash.  Im def gonna cash out a little bit the next rise, but for sure am waiting for the 100k and intend to pass down to my kids
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:59:18
The Mantra means that 1 Bitcoin equals 1 Bitcoin whether you are in USA or Japan or Australia or wherever.  Whereas 1 Dollar does not equal 1 Yen or 1 Rupee etc.

haha and which comes first!
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:04:55
i might get suckered into buying a little more...
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:39:05
no not at all.  I feel confident that at the worst case scenario we will see ATH's by the next halving.  Best case scenario is this summer or by the end of the year.  I personally think we are close to the bottom but of course i wouldn't rule out another scary drop to 5k or below and then epic recovery.  We are witnessing the birth of a new industry.  Tons of money to be made and its also based on a revolutionary new technology that WILL get adopted because its better than our current system.  This is of course just my opinion based on research.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:14:59
I really don't see it falling too far.  wouldn't make sense to drop much lower than 8700-ish
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:45:00
Problem is the Name. Bitcoin Cash is cheesy sounding and the entire world has only heard Bitcoin.  Psychologically speaking Bitcoin will always be  in their Minds.  And SOV idea is more of a reason to initially participate in this new technology - not a new kind of digital cash.  Ver obviously knows this and is going crazy
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:12:41
Could someone clarify for me how OTC(over the counter) buys work?  For example there are rumors of huge Bitcoin buys happening OTC, but if that's true then its not affecting the price.  Ive heard that only buys on exchanges affect the price. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:09:33
i don't know what to think anymore.  But i would like to pay for things with it once the price comes back.  I feel like once it passes ATH's and all the the current holders are in the black there will be more incentive to spend it.  Or wait till it goes higher.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:40:20
I don't see them succeding in creating their own inflation shit coin.  There are too many issues in doing that.  And even if they did they can't just do it over night.  It will take many years to implement.  Bitcoin and crypto is 9 years ahead and stronger than ever.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:59:33
so I'm assuming that would mean 32MB blocks are something that the big players in this space really want then.  Such as Miners and Coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:17:18

i don't think it needs to be a currency, digital gold is more realistic IMO and i think it could easily be a multi-trillion market cap similar to Gold and still not be a currency or threat to the FIAT system because people will just look at it like an investment/part of their portfolio
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:33:11
sorry meant to say because passing 5k was significant.  I starting getting involved at 2500 in May 2017 and it wasn't till october that it passed 5k.  And that time period included to 2 sharp V bottom recoverys.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:23:55
who the hell is pumping BCash.  I got some for free at the fork but since then I've never met a REAL person who actually wants to buy it
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:48:04
depends on the month LOL
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:22:35
do you short Bitcoin?  maybe thats something i should try
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:40:31
markets go through cycles.  Ups and Downs'.  The next up will be bigger and the next down will be bigger and repeat.  Most ppl won't start adopting the technology though until the market is much more mature., at that point you will get the benefits of the technology but not so much the financial gains
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:42:21
Lol that's a solid bet!
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:13:14
As Awful these prices are it can be equally stressful when you either have to sell or sell and it goes on to double/triple or whatever.  I can totally see myself selling at lets say 30k if we get back up there only to see it go to 100k.  happy Easter man thanks for your reply! Lets hope the spring is beginning to spring again!

makes sense hopefully we get some fireworks this week
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:49:19
but why would Coinbase buy it then?  There must be something valuable going on
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:08:01
cool thanks for reply.  realistically not sure how much time i have to do it 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:50:54

@_date: 2018-04-06 22:34:45
woah holder since 2013 and you are feeling it thats gotta to be a good sign.  I started May 2017 and went through two corrections and this current one being the third.  There was always a point in the first two corrections where it was clear the bottom was in and then it was just like boring for two weeks or something.  Perhaps This time its just cause the scale of the price has gotten insane and needed more time to digest 
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:49:38
haha thats true, but i will have to sell some if we get a major bull run.  got expenses!

Does anybody have any experience accepting bitcoin at their business or paying in crypto at a local small business?  And if so do you know if its easy for the Business owner to convert to Fiat?  And any idea what the fee's are associated with accepting crypto and converting to Fiat ?  
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:50:14
cool thanks for your ideas.  I think there's a lot of potential and perhaps each company will try out different options.  I think discussions like these are where its at as it proves the potential of the technology.  It seems that new models based on blockchain apps will eventually be understood to be better than the current models for Both the corporations and consumers

 “Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”  I never thought about this possibility.  I can't even begin to comprehend how awesome it would be but at the same time I'd be surprised if governments allowed it.  Exciting times to be living through this
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:34:38
when I got involved initially i spent a lot of time trying to educate and convince ppl.  Its exhausting and i don't have the time to help you.  I suggest scour youtube, find beginner intro stuff on reddit.  The best thing you can do is buy some Bitcoin or Litecoin or Ethereum.  A little bit of each one and forget about it for a few years.  If you didn't find anything great about it than why are you here?
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:39:32
so why was Bitcoin invented?
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:41:55
whats your opinion on Coinbase Commerce?
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:13:49
yes that was the problem with the insane price gains so its great we got this correction.  You can not buy this short term.  You must hold for 1-4 years and be researching and staying up to date with the industry.

i know total bs.  i think he's at the bottom of the barrel of people to pay attention to
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:29:59
I agree with that pattern.  Id say accumulating at any price below 12k at this point is a great long term bargain.  Best part is the public won't start to care again until the market is back over 15k and this time i won't care about talking about it with my family and friends.   
@_date: 2018-07-13 14:07:38
thats just hilarious, nobody really understands how it works! Arthur Hayes suggested an ETF approval would have brokers basically showing up with giant checkbooks, and that guy obviously knows whats up with this industry more than anybody.  So I'm optimistic.  Wall street loves new asset classes.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:32:12
id imagine if they did help create the run up and subsequent crash there is more money to be made in doing it again then just suppressing the price
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:08:45
i agree with the taxation theory.  the higher the market cap the higher the tax revenue.  They say bitcoin is the greatest transfer of wealth, but if that happens it will also be the greatest Tax windfall in history.  It would actually jump start the economy in many ways
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:55:06
wow amazing, and when we bottom out soon, lets take a pic of that because one day paying 6k for a Bitcoin will seem like a dream
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:05:34
thanks for commenting, great points.  I personally am in the camp of BTc being Digital Gold.  Anything beyond that is too speculative IMO.  Who knows what the future holds, but I think BTC could have a market cap of 1-2 trillion without disrupting the legacy system too much.  Instead it could just serve as a hedge and a part of a person's typical portfolio - mix of stocks, bonds, gold, and now bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:09:04
def gonna wait to see what happens next few days.  interesting that the volume is gone today and price is down.  I feel like this is the same BS that happened at 8k.  soon to be 6k.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:18:39
i would like nothing more than a boring market again  like it was last summer
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:49:55
it is weird that ppl spend their time shilling this.  id imagine a million more ways to spend my time
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:18:50
i don't know what to think anymore.  going down to 4k or lower wouldn't even surprise me.  even though i think that'd be total bullshit

yes i know how crazy he is, saw the doc. His Bio looks completely legit though.  it doesn't matter if he murdered that guy or whatever other crazy shit he's done.  What matters is what he says during interviews.  Ive seen just about every interview of him since last May 2017 and I get the impression he has a strong grasp on the technology and industry.  He's and old man at this point and has nothing to gain by spewing lies.  Sure he may get paid 100k to promote coins, or to promote whatever, but during his candid interviews or speeches he's given on stage its generally about the technology and its implication and use cases
 His bio - is a British-American computer programmer and businessman. He founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company. McAfee Associates achieved early success as the creators of McAfee, the first commercial antivirus software, and the business now produces a range of enterprise security software. The company was renamed to Intel Security in 2011 after being purchased by Intel, though the software still retains the McAfee brand name. McAfee's wealth peaked in 2007 at $100 million, before his investments plummeted in the global financial crisis that began that yeaimmediately states he is a computer programmer and business man.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:52:49
I will never sell my entire position. Im too much of a believer long term.  And i also think it would be insane for Bitcoin to ever go below 5k again as I lived through the rise to 3k and 5k last year.  But i am considering taking some off the table, regretfully.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:16:02
i imagine because it would show theres a strong floor and could instill confidence in the market.  In addition the technology behind bitcoin is as strong as its ever been and its quite possible an ETF gets approved this year
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:59:20
Why is George Soros even wasting his time on this market?
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:02:09
My biggest bullish target still for this year is 120k.  Then correction down to like 20
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:59:50
Lol seriously this game is a total mind fuck.  My prediction is 4900 is the lowest.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:09:48
yes just did!

@_date: 2018-04-07 01:37:55
agree but things do change.  And now they do more than ever.  Technology and innovation has already disrupted countless industries.  Many people have lost jobs and new jobs have been created.  I see this as the birth of a new industry.   Adapt or Get Left Behind

good points thanks for response!
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:09:30
I need to have a better understanding as to how in the long term Bitcoin will stay valuable.  If its supply is finite then  i imagine it will have a cap on its price which would happen once the last coin is mined?   I can't think of another example of something on earth that is valuable and definitively Finite (sorry could be a stupid question and haven't had coffee yet).   They always seem to find more Gold and Oil so that's more unknown/guess work.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:18:23
i agree to stop thinking today LOL
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:32:12
oh i know all about it.  I saw the doc on him a few years ago and to be frank when I started buying Bitcoin and then saw him get interviewed i was like oh shit, this guy is crazy and maybe I'm totally wrong about bitcoin.  But after hearing him at conferences or interviews i've decided that he knows wtf is going on.  All i care about is information and ideally the most up to date.  For all I know the Winklevoss twins are Illuminati or whatever.  Honestly i think crypto is an agenda by the Elites.  Im just playing the game and hope to profit off of it.  And i do love the technology and implications of a new type of economy it could bring.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:20:24
Crypto AD ban could a blessing in disguise - more organic growth
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:37:04
i agree but disagree with the timeline.  If the price stabilizes around these levels or at least does not go below 5k this year could end very strong
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:10:22
they f-ing hate the thing for sure.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:09:01
yes i agree with everything you are saying.   all I'm saying is I've watched a lot of interviews with him and he says some really smart stuff.  Maybe everything that comes out of his mouth is not totally true, but the guy appears to have a strong grasp on the technology and why its valuable, use cases, problems it solves etc.    Thats all i care about and in order to keep your head straight in this game and not panic sell, doing tons of research is paramount.  at least thats where my head is at until the market turns around.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:20:10
yes 100%.  not selling. i think this is the birth of a new industry and asset class.  this shit should of died years ago but didn't.  now we have legit exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini.  I also predicted 8 months ago that CNBC would dedicate shows to it.  Now they talk about it on Fast Money every night and even more surprising they have the Bitcoin Price up for the entire show.  I don't take that as a coincidence.  I feel like we are at the bottom here, but perhaps it crashes more, but if you are not already in the game holding, you will miss out on the best days
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:32:38
as far as i know the whole point of the Nano is you can plug it into Any computer even if its loaded with viruses.  Because of the design  viruses can't affect the Nano.  I could be wrong, but that's what i read and why i bought it
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:53:17
haha i guess I'm not one of the ppl who think Bitcoin will go to 0
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:47:40
perhaps this is just a sideways bottom area.  Im blindly bearish so I'm not trusting anything.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:19:29
thanks man, its gonna be the ride of the century for sure
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:58:00
thats a good plan!
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:57:13
Wow George Soros.  Never thought Id see the day.  100k incoming, then the most scary drop in history - rinse repeat
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:36:39
did you watch the interview?  The guy knows more than me and is more connected.  He's outlandish but I don't get the impression he is lying about the potential of the industry.  His past is super shady but he did pioneer the Anti-Virus software.  My biggest concern right now is to feel confident that we will get back to ATH and outside of just the McAfee interview, the other panelists seem very confident about the future.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:53:36
Im just indulging you for the benefit of the real ppl on this forum.  Do you even own Coins?  Here for the Day?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:16:00
good point
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:21:00
but what if you do look back and its 40k?
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:57:31
I think it was partly consumer driven.  I mean what was it a 500 billion pump?  anybody that i know only put like $500 in.  But perhaps I'm totally wrong.  The article brings up valid points.  I imagine they financial elites do have endless billions to suppress the price.  At the same time though I'm a long term holder but may take a little of the table
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:47:17
what a great point!  That's like me selling CD's to a distributor who goes and destroys them so that nobody hears my music.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:43:32
hellz yea i got in a debate with a bunch of ppl on Reddit this week about him.  Who gives a shit if he's paid to shill coins.  The guy is not an idiot, he became famous for being a computer programmer starting the original Anti-Virus program.  His personal life is highly controversial and who knows what the truth is, and maybe he's a drug addict too, but if you watch all his interviews he knows what the f is going on more than most ppl.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:47:27

@_date: 2018-04-04 23:17:47
Tone Vays says we are testing 4900.  Which sounds pretty realistic.

Thanks for this detailed response.  To sum it up are you saying its wise to own some Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:46:38
probably true question is -- whats cheap --
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:54:07
Im more optimistic about the future but it could take many years to come back especially if this year ends with a dud.  I don't see it as an end though cause the technology was created for a reason.  Ive been in this for a little over a year and from my experience you really have to earn your bitcoin buy holding through these crashes.  There were two legit 40%+ crashes prior to this one And as far as i know the previous ATH of 1200 wasn't preceded by two 40% crashes. The hardest and least obvious time to buy is always the best in hindsight.  Time will tell...
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:18:00
oh yea forgot about the difficulty.  it always amazes me how well designed Bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:24:11
wow - if you don't mind me asking-  were you selling at the top or have never sold?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:13:55
HAHAH!!!  THIS IS GREAT!
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:44:02
my personal experience is that i don't like subscriptions.  Id rather read specific well researched articles and watch content from producers i enjoy.  If it was 10 or 25 cents per video id be into that
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:26:17
curious if theres anybody here that sells coins via LocalBitcoins?  I'm considering signing up as a way to make extra cash and promote the industry in my area.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:38:30
i agree with your perspective but think there are too many forces at play outside of simply making money to stop the train from passing 19k again. Thats like saying Bitcoin is Dead - yet again.  It should of died a long time ago, especially after Mt. Gox but it didn't.  Its stronger than ever.  But that being said, i will be taking profits here and there.  Perhaps when it comes back the harder decision will be when to take profits.  Lets say it passes 19k, goes to 30k and you take profits, then it pulls back and goes to 50k.  The game is going to get crazy
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:03:57
once i get my taxes paid id be willing to do a bet.  maybe we could use a smart contract?  Or are you a No-Coiner?
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:57:42
If you think Bitcoin is worth 0 then why are you here?  Just to make fun of everybody?  You should do something more worthwhile with your time
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:46:34
you are so smart you must be so rich by now.  why waste time here versus swimming off your yacht?  What makes 0 sense is you are not talking about the Technology, the development going on, the implications, the potential.  Sure we are still in the speculative phase but you cannot compare this to previous bubbles like the Nasdaq.  If you are then you don't understand Bitcoin and should stick with traditional assets Im not going to be the one to educate you though
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:37:02
this could very well be the bottom....or not LOL
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:03:47
i dont blame ppl that don't understand it.  I didn't understand it for many years.  I can only think of 3 ppl that bought cause of me and thats out of at least 100 ppl.  This includes talking to ppl who work for a55 billion dollar bank. Very complicated subject.  It was when I started studying Ethereum that i finally understood Bitcoin.  Check out RenegadeInvestors youtube from 2017 about Bitcoin and Crypto Portfolios video from last year about Ethereum
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:25:50
so you don't own any coins?

Yes he is Totally Insane. But i do think he's somewhat of a genius.  His Anti-Virus software at some point was in like every computer right?  I don't really pay attention to his insane prediction of 1million by 2020, but I've watched a lot of interviews of him and he makes great points.  My impression is the guy knows a lot more about the industry than I do
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:22:07
if you are down in the dumps about your holdings watch this new video By the CNBC Crypto Trader.  Awesome interviews and of course the legendary John McAfee who is confident the total Crypto market cap will hit 1 trillion by the end of this year  
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:22:17
are you new to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:36:39
gotcha i guess then a Twitter poll
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:34:33
this is actually fantastic news.   Hopefully the market will return to a more normal cycle and be more about the tech with a steadier rise in price.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:44:31
awesome, this is the stuff i like to read about

whats your take on big players like Soros just trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itself.  For example they can just play the game of it going down $100 or up $100 all day and make bank doing that

Any opinion on the Cartel article?  I just read it and its really convincing.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:22:53
they will benefit from the the technology too.  Jobs will be lost.  New Jobs created.  The 20k peak was the mainstream breakthrough .  the next rise will be validity 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:21:50
were you selling some at the top?
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:47:35
While I don't totally disagree with you.  I think all Bitcoin needs to be is an alternative investment asset to be successful.  Digital store of value works for me.  And If Bitcoin is failing then why is ICE and Fidelity spending millions building infrastructure ?  
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:07:31
well, we are still close to 3k, so I imagine its a great time to accumulate if you can

Rome wasn't built in a day.  Give it another 5 years and then lets see where these markets are at.  Right now is the greatest R/R for ppl who have the courage to buy for the long term.
I think Litecoin will eventually offer other financial services.  I mean look what's happening with MAkerDao on Ethereum.  This tech is only limited by ppl's imaginations 
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:04:46
They are just doing it for shits and giggles?  They must see a strong value proposition and/or opportunity to get in early to an emerging market
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:39:45
they've definitely spent millions building Bakkt and FDA.  FDA for one says they have 100 ppl working on it.  Besides they need to have all the regulatory check boxes checked, such as insurance and Fort Knox level security for the private keys and top notch servers/facility to store the coins.  
Interest in Bitcoin/Crypto comes in waves.  Right now we are at the trough and eventually we will be at a peak again, could be 1-3 years or more.  who knows.  And as price begins to rise again from the ashes the interest in Crypto will be unprecedented and this time around there will be tons of ways to get involved especially for institutions
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:42:11
its use case is money that i can do with whatever i want and take anywhere in the world.  As well no government or central organization  controls it.  That's a pretty big use case in itself  
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:49:31
i look at it more as a new technology which provides a way to transfer value digitally .  just like handing a person cash face to face.  The Internet has always needed "trusted Third parties" to handle money.  Bitcoin and crypto flip that industry on its head just like Uber did to taxis
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:27:36
this article is propaganda.  Michael Casey knows that speculation and profit taking is a what the power ppl of the world will do.  How about he writes an article talking about how holders/believers in Bitcoin need to stand their ground and not get scared by the Traders who are in it to just STEAL YOUR MONEY.  There are big forces at work behind the scenes IMO.  
The tech hasn't failed.  The use case's are more relevant than ever.  Who knows where the bottom is, but it will happen and Bitcoin won't die.  It also can't get replaced.  ITs impossible at this point.  Its the longest, most trusted and decentralized blockchain.

ouch pretty negative on Bitcoin huh?  Then why is ICE creating Bakkt and Fidelity FDA?  They are spending millions developing that infrastructure

this is a great perspective.  agree

btw lets not forget that if a major confidence in currency crisis were to happen in a first world nation like France or England or somewhere else Bitcoin will be a screaming buy.  Even though its primarily used as speculation, it does work as intended, even if not used as intended right now

sure, but bitcoin has way more utility.

Everybody dig deep and remember that Bitcoin arose from the ashes of the financial crisis.  When you put it in cold storage such as a ledger, then you will realize that this is the first time you are in control of your money (outside of cash in your pocket or mattress).  The fact that you can be in control of your money is under appreciated.  When you put money in a bank, THEY are in control of it and they make money off your money.  In the future this could flip.  So now all the fucked up shit that Banks do to make money, you can do yourself and basically strip them of their power to do fucked up shit you disagree with. You buy bitcoin to take power away from them, and by doing so you are forcing change.

true, i don't look at Bitcoin to pay my monthly bills. That's what jobs for.  But as far as having something out of control of my bank and the government and the fed reserve...that's where it shines imo

not necessarily.  The internet has always needed trusted third parties to handle money.  Thats no longer the case with the Invention of Bitcoin.  I look at it like its a new technology.  Just like the iPhone.  It takes time for ppl to adopt it and realize its value.  Over time the UX experience and general friction for mainstream adoption become more seamless

but Bitcoin is the bell weather.  It has to hit 100k for this industry to succeed.  Once it does that the entire world will stop fighting it and accept it.  First they Laugh at you, then they Fight you, then accept it.  We are still in the Laugh/Fight stage, but more Fight at this point

i like the post, but hard to believe you haven't sold any?  I mean if i was buying after the 2013 crash i def would of sold at least 1-2 at 18k

From the consumer point of view you are correct, but from the merchant pov they would love to get rid of third parties.  Perhaps in the future ppl will pay with Litecoin and the merchant will have the option to instantly exchange to a stable coin and it all cost's 1 or 2 pennies and the money is in their control the entire time.
