Did you buy $20 worth? Because losing $10 is a lot different than losing $10000 worth.

I also watch the market fairly often. In all reality I am fine that I sold at 890 seeing as I mined most of my bitcoins, if the order doesn't go through I don't really care.

Yes there is...
If bitcoins are only worth the $125 we saw a few months back, and if all the big money folks from china starts to realize that and they sell off at a loss then we go back to $125... And start all over.
I sold at $899. Laugh all you want but if the market suddenly spikes up I will be able to buy at less than $890, in fact I have a trigger limit buy order for $890. All you people saying "HOLD" are foolish. You should have sold when it was crashing, and buy back before the price you sold at!

And then they go home and make bitcoin poems. :)

That is a stupid saying that I keep hearing. This saying is only true if the price ever goes up. He has 100% lost purchasing power on the market.
In the past he would have been able to buy 3 new graphics cards, now he can only buy 2. No store on the market will sell him the same amount of items for the same amount of BTC now.
He HAS lost purchasing power. Evidently, he has also lost USD.

On another point, someone should be selling BTC for USD, converting to CAD, then buying cheap Canadian bitcoins. The USD to CAD conversion rate would make you a decent chunk of change. BTC are selling for $689 USD, but $735 CAD.
Canadian sellers are basing their prices on US markets, but not converting from USD into CAD. It's been this way for a long time too. I need to know Americans...

Thats a mistake people only make once. After I lost $10 in 15 seconds when I first started, I have never payed attention to it since. Luckily at the time I had all of my coins in another exchange.

Spend $10, get a cavirtex debit card, load card online, updated every 24 hours.

LOL, that's not wisdom, that just some speculator hoping that his investment stops losing money. Anyone with any brains would have sold once MTgox went below $1000, then bought back IF it rebounds. I said IF it rebounds, seeing as all these people are so certain that it will rebound, when there is no proof that it will. HA!

Jesus Christ this guy ***really*** wants to pump BTC, lol.

That is a saying, which holds true for almost all trading.
This person is saying that bitcoins "literally have nowhere to go but up", based on past performance. We are saying that just because it has done something in the past does not guarantee it will do it again.

If I had 100% of my value in BTC I would obviously have to spend my bitcoins.
Currently I cannot even pay my bills with BTC, but it makes sense for me to pay with my current CAD, rather than sell BTC for CAD, and then pay with that.
