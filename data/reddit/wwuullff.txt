There is no winning with press. They will misquote you or blatantly lie in order to get the story they wanted in the beginning. What you tell them doesn't matter. It better to not have your name associated with an article if your misrepresented. And if no one talks to the press then ppl will see they have no credibility and will do their own research on the subject.

Hey I live in Alaska too. You could set up a simple ecommerce website that accepts btc using bitpay and opencart. If you pay for hosting I can help you set it all up. An example of a bitcoin accepting website I made is here: thatlenspuppy.com

getting a new product manufactured is difficult. you must make a tool for each part. and all metals and plastics shrink/expand differently and you wont know by how much until you start experimenting. so you must tool and re-tool every little piece until they all fit. one product like the trezor might go through 10 retoolings, pending on their quality control. also pending on the skill of their manufacture. cell phones are usually in the tooling process for over a year before they are even announced.

2FA is the only way to go. Soon I hope we won't even need passwords, just a random number generator on our phones attached to our accounts.

This project won't be ready for about a month but if you message me I can help you get any type of basic system going. Just tell me your budget and how much space you have along with what you want to grow.

I really liked this. You should start an email newsletter with its progress. I think you should keep working on this as it could be really important in the future. People here were saying how things can be counter intuitive and will only reward the most popular belief. well it will at first, but imagine if people aligned their thinking correctly and counter intuitive results will somehow become the intuitive prediction of the mass. Something like this could change the world if it works. internet 2.0, not to mention AI implications. awesome!

How do I contact him for this service? Or has he set up a website for others to implement it?
