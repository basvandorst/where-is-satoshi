Easy and free 
You don't even need money for an SSL certificate.

Those certs are trusted, the browser will not block it.
I use that certificate by myself

Thanks, i also found that armory also supports it on the change log.
"Enabled SegWit on the mainnet. Running against a node with WITNESS service bit flagged will allow you to create SegWit addresses."
Is there any other segwit software(and mobile) wallets?, besides armory and greenaddress

BCH is shit, good that I have shapeshifted all my BCH.

You can have at least 100 millionth of a bitcoin
A full bitcoin is not required.

It only takes 24 hours for Bitcoin to go from 9400$ to 30000$, and you will never know when.
Bitcoin surprises you, it will always go up or down unexpected.
Bitcoin only goes up, not down !!!!, because it gets more rare.
That is why it is never late to invest in Bitcoin, it will not fall anytime soon(Maybe untill it will reach 21M in the next 2 decades).

Bitcoin.com needs to be closed.
They are spreading lies.

All it takes for the bitcoin to go from 6k to 20k+ is 24 hours, it will come soon.

I never used BCH, just got it because of the fork
