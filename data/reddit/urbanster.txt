Does he own all of those companies?

I am incapable of taking that coin seriously.

To be fair, anyone who worked on the code helped in creating Bitcoin.

This is what happens when you allow anyone to fork your software.

Yes. I'm going to buy CS:GO tomorrow with their autumn sale. Finally I can spend some of my gains to get something!
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:26:20
Of course that's a thing.

Do not use Minergate. They skim ~30% of your hashrate to mine other coins and dump them for next to nothing.

I swear I typed r/bitcoin instead of r/memes.

Nodes are the backbone of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:02:51
I swear i typed in r/ethereum here.

Such a shame this had to be displayed at an Antifa demonstration.

Put it on your car as well.

How much bandwidth will this use?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:47:18
This is becoming a joke at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:05:09
Run a node on the computers.
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:02:03
They should start large scale mining it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:29:59
Keep as much BTC in your wallet as you can. After the split, you will receive the same amount of the new coin as you had BTC. You can then sell the new coin for BTC or fiat.

That's actually very good.

Roger Ver is the real Satoshi. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Miners will earn an income through the transaction fees. If there is no mining, the network will be unsecure and transactions will begin to pile up. Eventually, the network will crash.
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:36:46
You can, but if you want extra security you can always keep it in cold storage.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:28:20
Yes, but it's not true Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:29:37
Correct. Same thing happened with BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:25:23
Can't say now. Check the news and the exchanges when it starts.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:30:58
That would be quite scummy (no offense). I doubt anyone would actually send BTC to you because they would think that your throwaway accounts would be 'paying' you.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:23:30


Not if they ask a user - then it's allowed.

South African here, saw an ad on Gumtree for a motorbike asking to be paid in Bitcoin. I think it was on r/southafrica.
Anyway, that just proves how much it is spreading here.
Edit: [Found the link](
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:33:08
Probably not at this rate. They would have to increase the transaction fees to make a profit.
