This may be a problem for me I take 100 bucks every 2 weeks out of my checking and put it in my coinbase and i have a chase account for my business....I really have no money in the personal but I  need the business one for payroll and other stuff. No credit cards with them and I've only used coinbase for a few months should I stop the transactions or no?
