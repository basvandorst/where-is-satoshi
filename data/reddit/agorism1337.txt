I have written small web apps for individuals before, this is the first time I have made a web app for the community.
What do you think of the signature feature? It is WAY simpler than the 2FA thing, right?
and FAR more secure, wouldn't you agree?

That is exactly why I did this!
Exchanges are the core of the cryptocurrency community. 
It is very embarressing that most exchanges are still proprietary.

you are talking about the MtGox bug?
That is not a problem for my exchange. 
On this exchange you are running bitcoind, and bitcoind checks to see how much money each account has.
It does NOT check transactions by txid like MtGox.

I made a cryptocurrency with the game go inside of it.
It is not yet ready for investing.
I am in desperate need of beta testers.
Please send me a PM if you are willing to be a tester.
When we finally start mining, you will get a head-start.

All these things are nearly the same technology:
*financial derivatives
*investing on stocks
*gambling on sports/politics
*gambling on future price of bitcoin
Bitcoin blockchain is not so good for these things, because you have to trust a centralized mediator to hold your bitcoins. 
A Prediction market on a blockchain could be used to do any of them in a decentralized way.

Buttercoin would take half your profits.
bitcoin-central depends upon mySQL and Ruby on Rails AND apache. This is a very big project that requires a team who understands all these tools. This code is more expensive to maintain than mine.
xchgb is unfinished and does not work.
intersango is code made for a particular business. they will not be available to solve your problems when they come up, because ultimately, the code was not made for you.
With my exchange:
The entire exchange is a small python program that takes zero skill to maintain. You do not have to install or maintain Apache or mySQL or any web developoement kits.
My exchange is totally free, you can use it however you want.
If you want help running my exchange, I will be available to make it run perfectly on your system.

I am programming this thing
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:37:44
Use my software :)
It is free!! (and untested)

Prediction markets will:
Make medical degrees worthless.
Reveal when politicians are lying.
Prevent terrorist attacks, like 9/11.
Allow for the creation of crypto-assets which maintain a constant value against USD.
Be a distributed crowd-funding financial instrument.

I used a webserver inside of python.
The entire server is a single page of python, about 400 lines.
When users look at your site, all they see is HTML. The website is supported by all browsers.
Besides that, you need to intall bitcoind and litecoind.
It is FAR FAR simpler than any PHP based website.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:11:09
I can get it running on your system faster than the equivalent PHP code would! :)
I will help you set it up, if you need help.

I wrote cryptocurrency to do the following:
Instant Messaging
board game go
board game connect6

Why wont it be trusted?
Is there some issue I am unaware of?
Why would PHP be safer than python?

I have been the lead software developer for a couple of blockchain projects that ICOd.  
I think I can give a valuable perspective on the situation.
I think it is likely that a murder occurred.
