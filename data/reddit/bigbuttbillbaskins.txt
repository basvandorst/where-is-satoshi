Mine GoldCoins....gldtalk.org.  Keep them, sell them or trade them for bitcons.
Good group of guys.

Good point
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:44:07
Your son got involved with a revolution in money.  The friend will regret selling his bitcoins.  
There are only 12 million now with a total ever of 21 million and they are being sold worldwide and used for transactions.  It is MUCH bigger than you can imagine.   The US senate is holding a hearing on it tomorrow because they are concerned for the US dollar...imo.
Check out bitcoinaverage.com, bicoin.clarkmoody.com and stay tuned here to see what is going on.
That car your son wanted will only depreciate.  There is a strong chance that this investment will make him very wealthy.
Yes it could go the other way to.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:45:57
In my opinion, your son made the right choice.  This will not come along again...ever.  He is young and that car would be nothing but a distant memory. 
Tell him to get a job now and pay for a car monthly.  If things don't work out with bitcoin, then all he's lost is a kids time.  Do you remember what you spent your money on at his age?
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:29:37
Say what??  It's number one on coinchoose.com loser.  That's why I mentioned it.
Fucking purists like you are going to destroy bitcoin.
You can't argue in favor of bitcoin and against all other coins.  It makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:56:18
Huh?  I'm 41 and I hold bitcoin.  What in the world are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:28:42
None.  It's too late to make money from bitcoin if you're not willing to put in over 20k.
Mine GoldCoin instead.  gldtalk.org  
They seem to be doing well.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:50:19
I had a relative do the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:31:49
How we can frame it as protecting people from percocet, pedophiles and prisoners.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:26:29
You have to type the amount to send them in your phone.  Not good.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:47:49
The world is quickly changing and your son sees the possibilities.  You just need to do some reading and you may just see them yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:27:12
Hahahaha!  I didnt' stop looking for it either.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:32:34
I want to know where we can get the leaks of what they've already planned to say.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:29:10
Jesus...great thoughts.  I'm upvoting because this is the reality.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:48:37
Bitcoin fairy of course.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:52:31
It's definitely going to have to be able to handle more than 7 transactions per second even if it's cumbersome as hell.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:32:14
Well sure if you're going to do without whatever it is you need to buy.
If you want your savings in BTC to go up though and you're have to spend x dollars doesn't it make sense to convert those x dollars to BTC and support BTC businesses?
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:21:30
Now before it goes to 10k per coin.  You can buy any amount you like.  Just get in NOW For christ's sake.  Buy 50 freaking dollars worth.
If it goes to a million a coin you'll have 100k.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:59:22
Mining is done for poor folks.  Buy a coin, half a coin...anything and hurry the hell up before it goes to 10k
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:02:22
Take all money combined which I believe is like 50+ trillion and divide that by 13 million assuming 1 million new coins will be mined by the time this theoretically happened.
So 50,000,000,000,000/13,000,000 = 3,846,153.846153846
Upper limit is at 3+ million per coin.

It's stupid and is discouraging adoption and their own profits.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:38:56
Let's just hope the Senate Hearings don't suggest this.  It is awfully odd timing wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:58:25
It's going to happen again and again until it's over.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:54:34
Buying something online is not POS.  POS is cumbersome as hell the way it' s currently handled.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:51:19
I would upvote this to the top if I could.  This is a VERY important issue.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:43:17
Best explanation ever.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:52:11
Someone goes from a possible impulse buy and a bitcoin supporter to not getting in and helping spread the word at all because of this stupid shit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:15:10
Dude...just buy a fraction of a bitcoin and start really experiencing it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:03:10
This doesn't even account for inflation and I think 50 trillion is a 2009 figure for total money on earth.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:43:28
Somebody caged that eagle a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:22:21
Do you think bitcoin will be used at all major poker sites and be a huge factor in remittance?
If so, the price is going to 10k+ at least.  These are jut a few things it will be good for.
Why would you not get in now if you think it's going to this price ultimately?  Stop trying to time the market.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:42:30
Yep
