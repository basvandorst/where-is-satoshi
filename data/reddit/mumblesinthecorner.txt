As reddit has opensourced most if not all its code it would be possible but not trivial to set up a reddit like site without all the censorship. Ive been long aganst some of the policies set by corporate reddit and imposed on the entire world. Its time for a tor based reddit server.

Cavirtex retroactively and silently changed their tos to allow them to steal thousands of btc just last year. How soon we forget

in other words, a buy opportunity.

anyone who leaves btc on a trade account is asking to loose it. I found out the hard way with CaVirtex. 
leave in your own personal secure wallet UNTIL you need it. 
otherwise its like me giving you a complete stranger a $1000.00 bill to hold on to for safe keeping, you might be an honest guy, then again maybe not.

The fact that they Require me to have a US bank account pretty much sucks balls.  It also means I will dump them as my corporate cc processor the second somone else comes up with more favorable terms.

Im going to have a talk with a lawyer/close relative who works in securities. She might be able to come up with some supporting case law to bridge the digital currency laws gap. In the end, is where it matters is explaining the problem before a judge in a way that relates to current case law.  at that point they can argue contract clauses till they are blue, it wont make any difference. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:26:15
thats why i come to reddit.. to be talked down from saying/doing stupid shit and commiserating with others of good heart and shitty karma/luck like me. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:45:15
yep..  I agree, no such thing as safe offline storage either.. but i figured CAVirtex was my best bet.  i sold most of my coin a year ago. This was just that last little bit. virtually worthless at start but curiously kept increasing.  I mostly was hanging on to it purely for kicks and had mostly forgotten about it until very recently with all the news. Then it was holy carp! money right when it was needed. 
so yea.. stupid me for trusting a Canadian company that seemed like it wanted to do things properly with the laws etc. 
crap like this more than anything else is what will keep bitcoin from reaching wider markets than drug transactions and shady transfers.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:31:58
thanks, Im not a normally violent person, but ive been screwed over so many times this year, im really getting to the end of my rope. Im really think i must have been somone like hitler in a previous life because despite the fact ive spent my entire life focus helping others, my karma seems to utterly suck. 
Im going to contact some reporters i know, they love this christmas ruined by big bad corporation stories, plus add on the bitcoin angle. 
thanks for the cointip, and listening to me rant. there are still some good people out there, i guess ill hold off on pushing the doomsday button for at least one more day..

Thanks, i appreciate it. I agree, i was incredibly stupid to trust anyone with my wallet. I was going though a period in my life where i wasn't sure id have a computer let alone a wallet. I think i'm mostly still in "how do i break this to my family" phase right now, its good just to have everyone's encouragement and ideas. I couldn't even sleep last night, i finally caught a couple hours and waking up to this was nice. Thanks to you and ozme i can at least buy something special for christmas dinner. May the Universe shine its face upon you and bless you for your kindness.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:28:37
sure and they had access to real money in my linked bank account to pay that. which i agreed to. But to me they had no right to convert that bitcoin without at least a warning. i received no warning that their terms changed. 
I'm just in tears at this point. Am i stupid for trusting CAvirtex? Absolutely. My life was/is in transition and i needed a safe place to keep my coin. It was symbolic in a way, of all the other things that were failing me as i tried to keep my family and community going, it was the one small bit of shining hope i had. I wanted to keep it unpolluted as a bitcoin separate from all the other crap going on financially. it was the only investment that wasn't either cashed in or worthless.  
so yea im stupid, but they are still thieves. They can hide their theft in the small print, but its still stealing from 2 small kids at christmas. 
 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:28:20
happy ending, they restored my coin. I would like to thank you for your kind gift, but since things have been made good, I can't keep it. thank you so much for your kind heartedness. 
+ozme ฿0.015 verify

is that safe? other than the obvious keep it away from flames..
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:55:53
Their TOS are certainly one sided thats for sure.  You may be right, though one would think adding money/btc would constitute activity.. 
Bottom line, yes i was stupid but what they are doing is pretty shady by any stretch. Imagine if a bank started cashing in your investments to cover bank fees without even sending you a bill before or after. That would be a pitchforks and torches witch hunt event. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:25:05
Bitcoin is dead? Oh you mean great opportunity to buy btc for cheap off of idiots who bought in mid bubble. 
Remember folks.. buy low, sell high not the other way around. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:41:07
terms changed a month after i transferred my last coin i made from my  bitcoin home heating project.  I feel like I've been kicked in the nuts. How the heck can they even legally get away with that? theft plain an simple. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:58:23
If it keeps happening expect it to kill bitcoin as we know it. government can tightly regulate cryptocurrency with the stroke of the pen. If mom and pop are screaming that bitcoin took their savings, it will be regulated just like all securities.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:10:27
going forward, i have no money for christmas presents.. Thanks CAVirtex. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:35:55
heh so do i.. sadly i got cold feet and sold 1000btc.. stupid.. stupid stupid.. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:10:39
1 btc. Contacted support, but based on what im reading on bitcointalk, it wont matter. im not the only victim of their scam. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:36:35
so if they were charging in dollars they should have taken it from my linked bank account. There is nothing in there that says they can convert my bitcoin to cover dollar expenses without at least asking for payment in the currency they agree to charge.
thats like an investment broker selling your shares to cover an expense he hasn't even attempted to invoice you for first. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:33:05

if virtual currency is to survive, it must go about getting clean real quick.

@_date: 2013-12-02 22:14:04
I think this is the crux of the issue. Changes in TOS happens all the time, but when changes are are far reaching and blatantly to the advantage of the site owner, they need to make a very serious effort to inform their customers. to do otherwise is underhanded and shady. I wonder how much they made in october off this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:41:30
they can send me an email. I have them set to highlight even .

I have a relative im talking to now who might want to take on the case. She loves this sort of new ground type law stuff. She is going to check out the case law and financial regulations and get back to me. Would be interesting to see this go class action. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:58:40
Even if coin base owned every bitcoin in existence they still couldn't afford the legal team required to take the banks to even small claims court. They would get buried and the judge in the case would get bribed or extorted whichever works. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:35:00
well thats the thing.. last activity was in march, so that should have made my account active until next march. at least thats what i was counting on.
