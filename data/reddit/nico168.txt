A hub will only see previous hop and next hop of each paiement they relay. How is it a pb for censorship resistance ?, 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:31:35
i meant: why do you think hubs may be a central point of failure for censorship resistance ?
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:51:46
\&gt; The reason is because the sooner you do the changes the better it is (..)
Why would a Bitcoin Cash user adopt a new optimized technology if blockchain space is "free" ?
Just see how SegWit takes times to be adopted, even when blockchain space is expensive.
I'm convinced that not increasing block's size has driven the community to put pressure on bitcoin's company to implement it.
I think its far easier to increase block's size because miners have a direct incentive to have bigger blocks.

Do you think that in 2020, miners will get most of their money with fees and the halvening will not be a big deal ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:42:33
Even if 1 bitcoin will worth 1 million, it will still be a half cut in rewards.

Sorry, i've been rude.
If you don't understand my question, then you probably can't help me. Don't waste your free time.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:18:05
I don't know if you dont understand bitcoin or if you don't understand what I suggest.
You know that bitcoin is printing new money every blocks ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:22:22
I forbid you to call it B-Smooth ! Bitcoin Smooth is the real Bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:31:02
I hesitate, should I call it SmoothCoin or Bitcoin Smooth ?

I'm not trying to start a war, I was just trying to understand why nothing was done to try to prevent the trouble than the halvening may generate.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:17:34
I was aware of the 2016 halvening and that the price did not suffer from it. I was not aware that, with no doubt, the halvening caused the price to picking up.
To be honest, i'm not convinced of it, nor by your explanation.
I'm pretty sure 2020 context will be a lot different than 2016, and i don't think we can predict what will happen from it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:45:39
Maybe you could read my post and find the question marks ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:28:57
I'm not suggesting that there should be more than 21m btc.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:29:05
A big majority of miners may leave if an altcoin with same Pow become more profitable.
Bitcoin will take longer to adjust if a majority of miners leave.
I don't understand why people think we should not care about it because the 2 previous halvenings went well. It's not a strong point.
What would have happened if the recent attack on BTC had happened during an halvening ?
So, yeah, I'm surprised that nothing is done to try reduce this risk.
It doesn't interest anyone, the post is downvoted.

It's the job of layer 1(btc) to be immutable and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:07:44


Actually, the transaction is pretty much instantly in the mempool, until a miner add it in a block.
If the mempool is big, it can takes times for the transaction with a low fee to be included in a block. Not now (  ).
A transaction that is in the mempool, so not yet on the blockchain, should not be trusted, because it's easy to emit later another transaction with a higher fee that will spend the same bitcoin before the older transaction, which then will be rejected.

I'm not sure to understand.
What fonctionnality problem does LN create ?
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:52:57
So yes, because LN is on top of layer 1.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:28:08


Which network ? Bitcoin or LN ?
I don't see how LN can recentralizes bitcoin network


How ? 


LN has nothing to do with the nakamoto consensus.
I've the feeling you don't know what LN is but you know you are against it.

No, You'll still have the same limited amount of coin.
Making it more divisible does not change it's value.
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:33:37
French here, we still use check a lot.
Mostly to pay bills by mail, or pay the pizza delivery guy when i don't have cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:17:27
yes, and we organize a vote for our independance, what could go wrong ?
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:52:59
Technically speaking, It's not a risk, an address is not meant to be hidden. 
But everyone is able to see how many bitcoin there is on this address. And if it's a big amount, the poster can be targeted (hacking, social engineering...)  
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:39:22
no, because it's accumulated proof of work that is important, not the number of blocks.
