Are all of you factoring in moores law? We wont be rolling with the same tech then.

Uh, no we aren't. We are just playing the new stock market. Once bitcoin is up we will take profit and keep riding the wave.

lol, bitcoin.com soon to ~~steal the css~~ re-design.

It also doesnt make sense to try and assume any of us have a clue what technology will be capable of in 83+ years.

Why you don't offer financial advice to your friends*
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:48:37
Depends where. And decent sum is left for interpretation... A few hundred bucks?

I had a dude who used to sleep on my couch tell me i should invest in bitcoin back when it was a few cents each. I laughed it off and declined because there just really was no easy or safe way to buy it back then.  
Jokes on me, that fucker quit his job and bought a sailboat. He just sails around the world now.

You would be dumb to just leave it all in crypto. Take profit out in fiat and stash it. Crypto could tank at any moment. Im not saying dont invest. But i am saying take steps to protect yourself.

This... Absolutely this. Somehow the mods of are even in on it. That's why you see bitcoin.com(owned by roger ver) on the right, but not bitcoin.org.  
Any time you mention bitcoin being better than bcash, you get downvoted. Even referring to it as bcash they play stupid Like they don't know what ur talking about. Then they try to start calling bch bitcoin.  
  
Without somehow being able to remove the corrupt mods the trolls pretty much have it.

Idk if hes into eating cocks, but according to the documentary about him he likes to have women shit in his mouth

Sounds like you got your head on straight. Im hoping for a nice spike too so i can take some profit.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:37:30
Its just another crypto tbh. Kind of neat that you can use BTC private keys to claim your BCH if you had it before the fork. But there is nothing that make BCH any better than say ZEC.

Come on baby im a ormD master... tell me you love my big unlabeled ormD package.  
  
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:15:53
Yea, probably not tho.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:13:50
Thats exactly what i would say if i stashed the private key and didn't want anyone to know.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:51:02
Make a new wallet, transfer your btc to it. The reason you do that is because you have to expose the private keys for the old one.  
Export the private key from the old BTC wallet.
Then find a bch wallet you can use to import your key.   
Magically your bch wallet will have coins in it.

And? All they have to do is get in the network by exploiting something else. Then they can take over your miner and patch its code to mine for them.
