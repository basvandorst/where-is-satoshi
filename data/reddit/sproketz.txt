When I read comments like this, it makes me realize many people shouldn't be trading crypto right now. This is a new market. It's going to be rough. If you can't handle the growing pains and the ups and downs that come with them, this isn't for you. There will be more. Count on it.
Your orders weren't filled unnecessarily, you set what you wanted and it filled. You aren't always going to know every bit of news that moves the market or how far it will go. Be prepared to be surprised. That's the best advice any of us can take.
Getting the news given to us ahead of time would be it's own brand of unfair. In this case info leaked and served a few very well. Shit happens. Welcome to the wild west.

You presume too much. My portfolio is too diversified for anything to ever hit me harder than I'm ready for.

They're just jealous. They have FOMO. And this makes them feel better.

Ha! You know how that plays out... The second you sell it will bounce back up and you'll miss it.

No.you didn't fuck up. 
Big bit of advice on  crypto. Don't  day trade crypto. Make every investment long. The markets are too unsteady anyway for day trading.when shit gets real they lock the  exchanges, or traffic overloads etc. 
The crypto market is still young. Market caps in the  trillions are coming. That money has to go somewhere and a ton of it is going to end up in bitcoin. 
You'll be back up and then some. Just give it time.

Lol. Banks are scared of the blockchain. Buh bye banks.

They also  take 2+ weeks to run a simple identify verification. If you're lucky.

This is called a dip. Buy it before you miss it.

Yup. I actually think their method of just letting new additions be a surprise is fair.
To the complainers talking about this being a market manipulation tactic, that's just as easily done with an announcement as an instant go live. It's all the same. News is news and it affects the market. This shouldn't be a surprise.

Investing in crypto is not for pussies. If you aren't ok with daily  30% gains and  losses, it ain't for you.
Only real men need apply. Your bosses sound like pussies.

Satoshi knows. Unless he's dead.

Oh, well if turpajouhipukki on the internet says so then it must be true. Hey guys we can all rest assured now. Random internet guy says so.

All we really need is Ripple everywhere. Kinda solves all those problems at the same time. Who needs bitcoin when you can do the crazy magic that Ripple does?

Good advice. I dollar cost average everything I buy for this reason.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:25:53
I think you meant $0.7 billion digital fortune.

Lol. I wonder how much he is hodling.
