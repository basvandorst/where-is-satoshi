They post almost exclusively to t_d so this post is likely only here because the dan nathan guy is anti-trump

And with net neutrality being dissolved they probably will. So that their corporate friends can get priority mining.

Also, after never having seen that gifarch site, I've just now seen 3 links on Reddit in the past 5minutes. Not kidding. Spam is all it is.

I would be cautious about saying reputation lends more credibility when it comes to security. Up until recently no one expected Equifax to be so poorly secured but here we are.

Yes.  It's considered a taxable event.  
  
  (Not sure how people feel about investopedia, but i think it does a decent enough job to answer your question in more detail)
And it's always safe to assume with the IRS that whenever you gain any kind of money (especially one that is an easily traceable online transaction) the IRS is going to ask for due tax on it.    
If you don't hold for at least a year then you'll be subject to short-term capital gains tax which is basically the same as your income tax rate.

Yea I started off with both. Then just stopped coinbase altogether. Just use gdax for trade view and that's really it.

As someone who's treading lightly with crypto due to the tax implications (and trying to warn others to heavily research their taxes) I just wanna say I appreciate responses like this as most people won't even consider the fact that having a wallet in say a Euro exchange site means they should probably file it.  I was not previously aware of the FBAR (just hasn't become relevant, or i've not made it that far yet) and now I do.
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:26
Yea I hope they'll expand their offering soon. I'm sure they want to but maybe being regulated has slowed that progress
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:23
Yes. I don't wire only ach and you get to trade against that amount immediately. Only downside to Gemini is the limited trading pairs (BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ETH/BTC)
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:07:15
We don't need it as every thread contains a variation of the same exact thing already :D

Coinbase opened a bunch of positions recently. Maybe it is/was an excuse but bringing people on board we will expect things like segwit. They better provide.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:53:44
I think it's easier just to look at it by percentages. Take your income tax rate and apply that to each months bitcoin value/earnings

Just watched that movie for the first time last night. Really enjoyed it and not quite what I expected. (The Big Short for the curious)
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:43:44
Oh that one. I wasn't sure if it was the upcoming one, the forthcoming one, or the impending one. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:37
Gemini has been very very good to me. Wish they had a more elaborate trading platform but otherwise have had a great experience. Pre-credited funds is amazingly useful in this fast paced market
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:35:54
How long ago did you start verification with bitstamp. Still fucking waiting on mine and even have a ticket open.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:53:09
Generally more expensive though
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:20:01
I think it's mainly cuz of the book part haha "here in my garaaaaaage...."
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:19:18
Not all verification cases are the same. All positive experience on my end. Customer service was even relatively responsive during the holidays which I never expected
E: Okay? Someone with no required background checks or credit issues will get approved faster than someone with a checkered past. C'mon use your heads
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:47
No app. Website not mobile optimized either. I have bought using the website on my phone though. It works well enough but could definitely use an app or mobile site
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:31:17
Yea you have to calculate a cost basis for the date of the transaction (what price was BTC at time of trade, what price was the alt at time of trade, etc.) and then you can get an idea of gain or profit.  bitcoin.tax website has some good info.  Here's their faq: 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:23:29
People who do a lot of trading: what are your taxes looking like? Seems like if you swap a lot your list of transactions become much more complicated and tedious. I am looking into trading to some alts possibly but not sure I wanna bite the bullet and eat the income tax on each transactions net gain. Also I know there are services like changelly etc. but is there a zero net way of converting coin to avoid tax? Like if you saw more value in an alt?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:36:32
No problem, hope it helps ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:33:23
Are you also accounting for the additional income tax you'd have to pay on the cash outs?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:41:45
If you dont have flames trailing you on the asphalt then you dont deserve the lambo

Most will suggest dollar cost averaging I'm sure (basically incrementalk investing). But for now I'd think waiting for a small dip back under 11k and invest some then to start.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:20:21
Yes as a paper wallet and ledger are essentially the same thing albeit one is obviously more primitive
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:18
Have you done any trading?  Trading is a taxable event.  Simply purchasing BTC and other crypto is not taxable.  Just a purchase of "property".  Only when you realize the gains will you need to report.  Trading to other crypto is included in that (trading BTC -&gt; ETH that nets a gain for instance).
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:56:56
Yeah that's one of the he major reasons for crytpo. It's supposed to eliminate the wait and fees imposed by central banking. Currently you can wire or do an ACH transaction (usually simply called "transfer" for most institutions). Takes about a week for the money to clear. What I suggest is Gemini. It's another verification process but the way they are setup is such that once you initiate the bank funds transfer you can start purchasing and trading coin immediately. Your bitcoin won't be available to you until the funds clear but it allows you to get some bitcoin at the current values.

Disclaimer: I'm no tax lawyer or specialist, just someone trying to learn as much as i can to protect myself from tax implications. I am not responsible for any losses or hardship based off this information which is solely my opinion and research.
Sounds like you could possibly be entering into a grey area as it may venture into "gifting" territory which people often refer to "tipping" (like a bitcoin tip).  I'm not certain what the implications are for basically giving your bitcoin away yet as i haven't crossed that scenario personally, but i would research into gifting bitcoin and personal property and the taxes based around that (since bitcoin is considered personal property).  Since you're not making any personal gains from this you would probably still need to report the transaction as if normal to ensure your side is covered and then whomever receives it will need to report receipt of it (and then capital gains if they withdraw to USD).
