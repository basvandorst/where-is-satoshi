Looks like someone got rich from Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:23:11
Wow, you're dumb. Your girlfriend (if you have one) is going to break up with you and get with back up guy   or  that she has been starting to see since hearing about Bitcoin. You better prove her wrong, gambler.

Republicans have been more in favor of smaller government and are generally more reasonable than the Democrat/Liberal pack.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:35
You really think people care that much?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:58:41
I hope he kills himself.

@_date: 2014-02-27 05:34:15

@_date: 2014-02-22 05:15:40

@_date: 2014-02-12 13:39:56

@_date: 2014-02-26 20:07:15
Such an idiot. See, this is democrats for you.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:34:36
Life is hard it's not Bitcoins fault, it's your fault for being a whiny little bitch.

@_date: 2014-02-14 16:21:57
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:10:31

"Is Apple becoming IBM?" 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:05:22
That's just how the game works. You can't control it. I don't want to see years in the future someone running for Hope and Change of the Bitcoin Economy and regulate the fuck out of it while producing nothing of value because they are just as crooked.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:34:27
Democrat stooges are going to kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:48:15
fuck off
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:17:44
These idiots were the cancer of Bitcoin. The one time I tried to use it back in 2012 made me quite aware of that.
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:18:39
well it is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-22 15:30:14
lol. sounds like you had coins on mt.gox. your world is now crushed and you don't know what is real anymore. lol
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:16:40
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:27:05
... Except the only difference with Bitcoin is everyone is cheering it on. I wonder if I will be quoted for saying this, when the government unveils their version of something to compete against Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:34:54
old news. go away fag.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:05:07
and what will they do with it?
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:40:53
barack obama is anti-competitive
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:05:58
That's not a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:21:55
