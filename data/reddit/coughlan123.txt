A usdt failure would be a decoupling from the dollar,  if tether starts to loose its usd peg what do you think peoples first reaction would be.... swap it for bitcoin maybe??  
Anyway it’s more likely that the actual dollar will fail before usdt...

I doubt any decentralised exchange does enough volume to affect the price of btc....  and I think there is only one exchange where you can trade bitcoin  in a decentralised manner. Blockdx

I think bitcoin brings with it more worldwide exposure to USD.  Most stable coins are pegged to,  and backed by USD. 
Bitcoin also doesn’t exactly fulfil all the criteria that money does.  So it’s not really in competition with the USD as a medium of exchange.   
It’s still just a speculative asset, and more of an ongoing experiment than anything else.

Mainly for different coins/tokens.  I keep most my tokens on IDEX if there is liquidity for them as it’s a safer way to store them.  
And then I use the others for btc pairing and other coins. 
I think I trust bitmax over binance nowa days.  I keep getting the feeling that binance is going to do mt. gox.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:36:36
Really... so you use it to pay your rent,  do your groceries shopping,  buy drinks when your out on the piss.   I seriously doubt it....
If bitcoin succeeds it will be a digital reserve currency.   But I doubt it will ever be used as money.

You won’t find many kind hearted people in the world of crypto.  I don’t have allot of sympathy for you to be honest.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:11:29
Bitcoin will probably never be used in this manner... bitcoin is not money.   
If it succeeds it will be a digital reserve currency.

Yes...always keep your financial decisions to yourself. 
Don’t brag about your gains,  be cool calm and calculated.  
Obviously there is no harm in educating people either though.
And if they all start asking you how to buy bitcoin.... you know it’s time to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:47:48
Maybe you have allot of bitcoin,  but for the average punter they can’t risk getting paid in btc whilst it’s so volatile.
Plus I reckon your full of shit too.  
Bitcoin does not make good money,  if the price ever stabilises which is entirely possible once it gets over a certain market cap and people realise they would rather hold bitcoin than fiat or gold  then it still won’t make good money as it will be far too valuable to spend on shit like your groceries. 
I like bitcoin, I’m an investor but it is not money and probably never will be.

I find it hard to believe that bitcoin will follow this path.  Sideways price action for a year is entirely possible though.

We’re just going to have to agree to disagree then.  Time will tell which one of us is right.  
I still think you’re! Full of shit.
Bitcoin is way to volatile to use as money,  and you’re a fool if you believe otherwise. 
It’s a new asset class and might possibly be a digital reserve currency one day.  
Moneys primary function is as a medium of exchange,  not a store of value.
If holding onto money was all you had to do to get rich then no one would ever invest in anything and economies would go stagnant.

If they can roll back or fork eth to deal with a hack or stolen funds then men with guns can make em do anything they want with eth.  
I’m no expert, but that is what gives bitcoin its value, it’s secure and censorship resistant.
Having said that I think ETH for me is a much more exciting project with huge potential to change the world of finance.

If bitcoin becomes the worlds digital reserve currency, then it will be the currency to which all other currencies are valued against.  This will take adoption on a huge scale and will probably never happen.

@_date: 2019-06-21 16:45:54
Well they already did a hard fork to to return stolen funds. And the forked chain ended up being the eth we use today.
I like ETH, I’m an investor.  But it’s not as censorship resistant as bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:33:53
Eth is not censorship resistant like bitcoin.  Big difference!!

Yes I do believe that a fixed supply currency would lead to permanent deflation.  Especially with a growing population and the fact that allot of money just gets lost or destroyed.  
I believe that the perfect money would have some kind of inflation built into it.  Not to be controlled by humans though obviously... 
And regards the price of bitcoin stabilising,  yes I think it’s possible but it’s not a certainty either.  At the moment the majority of people are buying bitcoin as an investment to ultimately sell for fiat.   Including institutional money too.  
So in conclusion bitcoin is to volatile to use as money at the moment,  and if its value stabilises in the future I still don’t think it would function well as a medium of exchange for everyday use.

I missed the top,  but I can tell you there were plenty of signals.
Friends who were completely computer illiterate and who knew nothing about investing asking me how to buy bitcoin.
It being the topic of conversation at my local barbershop when I was getting a hair cut.
Going out in the evening and overhearing people talking about bitcoin and xrp... 
This all happened within a week long period. 
The writing was on the wall, but I still missed the top.  did ok though overall.

Get a job for Christ sakes,  or go to uni and study.... be responsible!!  
No doubt crypto will rise again but you can’t rely on it to keep you fed until then.  And even if it does and you end up ridiculously wealthy it’s good to have some sort of profession. 
Educate yourself.... expand your mind.

Chill out man,  bitcoin will do what it’s going to regardless of what anyone says on social media.
@_date: 2019-09-28 08:41:40
Bitcoins value so far has been speculative.  But bitcoin is also a hedge against bad monetary policy.   When governments print money to excess they are stealing value right out of your pocket.  And you have to pay income tax on top of that....  
You have an asset class with a fixed supply and a currency with an ever increasing supply....

Hodl is good... but that doesn’t mean you should never take profit.  Or try to play the bigger market moves. 
I would suggest a strategy based on the market cycle between btc and alt coins.  If your willing to put in the work it’s fairly easy to increase your btc position by speculating on alt coins.  Learn the market cycle and try not to overtrade or be greedy.   Only risk %20 of your your btc at a time and aim for 8-10% gains. And use stop losses.  
And then try to sell the top!!  Not easy at all!!  But I would advise you to look at the monthly RSI on btc/usd, so far it called the top and bottom of the last market cycle.   Who knows, it might work again.  
Good luck!!
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:32:45
What do you achieve by doing this?  Remember you need your Coinbase account if you ever decide to cash out your bitcoin too. 
I don’t think you will regret putting money into crypto at this level.
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:56:00
Check out NPX,  apparently their trade bot outperforms bitcoin. Works on bitmex through an api.
I haven’t tested it yet, but will be doing so shortly.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:59:12
Market cycles,  bitcoin is king.  Alts still need to prove themselves,  but don’t think that speculation on alts is over.... when the time is right they will pump.   Hopefully allot of them will die though,  make sure your positioned correctly.
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:26:56
Never panic sell,  not unless there’s a black swan event and even then try not to panic as price action always tends to give you a better exit than when you initially shit yourself.  
You can always hedge your position with a short on bitmex.  Or if you feel like the market is topping out sell half your stack to buy back in lower and increase your position.  Again very risky though.
Best just to hodl too the top.... where ever that is!!
