I agree actually, I think maybe instead of saying that candlesticks don't make sense, I should just say I prefer to look at the average price.

On BTC-e the 30 week ema is ~$487
edit: according to bitcoinwisdom mt.gox 30 week EMA is about $560.
 I used metatrader for the BTC-e price which is the 30 week EMA based on the median price. bitcoinwisdom seems to use the closing price which doesn't seem like an accurate indicator in the world of bitcoin since the market never actually closes

*raises hand* I would have been using Mt.Gox if it weren't for the people calling bullshit early on. The exchange I started with was CampBX but when Dwolla stopped dealing with cryptocurrency I went to Mt.Gox. I quickly found out how shady Mt.Gox was and switched over to Coinbase. I also have a Kraken account, but they aren't setup for trading in Utah (my home state).

That day is already here. No one did trades on the silk road without escrow. It should be a warning sign when someone doesn't want to use an escrow. Most people are not acquainted with this idea because we've all used credit cards and paypal for years now.

Satoshi shall walk the Earth. The perfect blockchain will be brought to us. Heathens and their decadent network will be swept from the land. Those who have faith may partake of the endless wealth beheld in the blockchain.

Most the solutions I've seen involve some sort of credit system. You use the service and based on your usage credits are deducted continuously. For example, I've tried out many cloud hosting services. The whole idea with cloud hosting is that you can scale on demand. Because you can and do change your resource usage, you shouldn't be charged a flat rate. Some cloud hosts allow you to pay using their own proprietary credit system. Using x amount of disk space per hour costs y amount of credits. Same thing for processor cores, and ram, etc. There are a lot of problems with this model, but it does have some of the same benefits as "real" micropayments.

It costs a lot more time and money to use test kits to find a specific chemical (as opposed to buying that chemical instead of random pills). It's really just not reasonable for the average person I think. That's not to say that if you are going to buy pills on the street you should just take them without knowing what they are. What I'm trying to say is that, if you are the type of person that thinks about recreational drugs enough to use a test kit, you are better off taking the whole thing more seriously and dealing with people who also practice harm reduction.

Only anecdotes from various forums, chat-boxes, irc channels. I'm not saying Vault of Satoshi is shady at all. I just think that they maybe shouldn't be one of the first websites we recommend to newbies.
I wish I could give you a link but I don't have one. I just know that there have been cases of problems with deposits and withdrawals which were mostly sorted out eventually.

The OP wouldn't do better without asking for funding because he thinks the idea isn't worth doing other than to take peoples money. That's the whole point.

Maybe I'm ignorant but I thought that a company had to be for sale before it can get bought out (if it's a corporation a majority of the stock must be purchasable) I don't see why Bitpay would want to sell out
Edit: I googled a little bit. I'm basically right. Technically the person/company buying out another company does not need to buy the majority, just gain the controlling interest.
To expand on my point, theoretically Paypal could do a hostile takeover and might have enough power to do so. My gut tells me that they wouldn't do that but I have not tried to prove that they wouldn't. I'm curious what everyone else thinks!

Richard Stallman is great, he says things that I wish more people were talking about. He's not helping push bitcoin mainstream though. Stallman is generally just repeating the same points that he's been repeating for years. The only difference at a bitcoin conference is he'll mention that his points apply to bitcoin, and that he likes bitcoin.

If you lower the fee you risk the transaction being ignored by miners. If your inputs have more coin age then it is more likely to work. For a real business you don't want uncertainty though. A better solution than lowering the fee would be to use an escrow that does off-the-blockchain micropayments for you. The transactions between you/the escrow and the company/the escrow would be large enough to make up for the transaction fee. This same concept could be applied with cash instead of bitcoins, and I think it has been already, but is not common. Usually it is simpler for one of the parties to trust each other and have early or deferred payments.

I really wish this would become widespread but I just don't think it will. Good idea though. Would probably work better in an mmo more friendly to trading items for money.

If you have a good reason to be doing something you should be able to explain it to a loved one and have them understand. I don't mean to sound harsh, but: maybe you shouldn't be investing heavily if you can't justify it to the most important person in your life.

Bitcoin is not a stock my friend. I would argue that it might not be reasonable to leave all your money in the blockchain unless you are part of the movement though. That is to say, unless you are part of the reason bitcoin will succeed, how can you be sure that it will?

My opinion is that candlesticks don't make sense for a market that doesn't close. I'd rather see a line representing average price (preferably weighted by volume).

silk road... and believe it or not I am aware of local potheads/dealers that would gladly take btc. These aren't professional drug dealers I'm talking about though, more like college students with a steady supply.

My "wife" knows that all of my savings are in crypto. It's not nearly 35k, but we are still young ; we are both 21. Situation is a little bit different because to us our job prospects promise much more wealth than we currently have (and we are not in any debt). If you are tied financially (as most couples are) with someone it is rather unethical to not let them know what is going on.

I was discussing BTC-e with someone and we came to the conclusion that the exchange is still run out of Russia despite claiming that it is a cypriot business. This could become a problem. I don't know if they are actually incorporated in Cyprus. Additionally, I worry that it is not in their best interest to reveal themselves to the world. In fact, I do think that if they wanted to "go legit" they would create a new exchange instead of continuing the BTC-e legacy.

That's unfortunate. I always save records of everything, so even though I don't know what I have off-hand, I can figure it out if I need or want to. Most sites have a csv or json export feature, you don't have to use the data right away but you are better off to have it around. This is one of the serious issues with electronic currency: paperless record-keeping. Large corporations have been doing it for a while but it's not a widespread phenomenon. We learned as a society to write things down, now we need to learn how to encode them

Hey you actually have a good idea here and I think it could gain support. Why don't we crowd fund a campaign for bitcoin awareness?

I'm quite certain that right now there is no reason for anyone to pursue a degree in "Digital Currency" (I'm going to talk more specifically about cryptocurrency). It seems much more reasonable to get a degree in: computer science, cryptography, economics, marketing, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, wow, what else? Cryptocurrency is an exciting new field and it is still being built. You are better off being one of the people that will teach others about cryptocurrency later, than trying to be a student of it right now. The ideas that would be learned in a Digital Currency course right now could quickly be deprecated or disproven. The ideas learned from a related course in an already-established field will definitely be useful though.  Of course, I am stating my opinion. Maybe I have flawed thinking, or have overlooked something. I am not considering going to school to study digital currency, and so I don't need to over think this.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:00:41
My opinion is that the open and close price has a psychological effect on the market. When it's 24/7 there is less of that effect. Candlesticks are still useful to quickly see the price variations for a set period.

To add to this, I don't think any sophisticated blockchain analysis software exists yet. AFAIK it is left up to humans to use programs that query the blockchain, and maybe some scripts written on the fly to do calculations or combine data. In fact, I am going to look into this right now, because I believe I have the skill to create such analysis software (or at least start the process)
