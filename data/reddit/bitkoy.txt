There would be many fun things you could do if you could predict the future. Unfortunately nobody can.

Where is not the problem. You can get it at most existing exchanges.
The problem is that you need to go back in time to 2012.

I cannot believe that people are still talking about this fraud.

Your numbers are wrong. Segwit is expected to increase capacity by 70%-80% with normal transaction patterns and full adoption.

No, reddit in general is not banned.

Until there is nobody left who buys. That is the point where it crashes to zero. The whole price is based on the assumption that bitcoin will be used as currency one day.

You can emulate many many mobile phones on a high performance server.
How would you prevent that?

For comparison:

Users have some sort of control, but miners too. We need bigger blocks for short-term scaling.

My prediction is that the bitcoin dominance compared to altcoins will be significantly increased after the hardfork.

Buy a dice. Roll it everyday at noon. 
1..3 = buy

Try what?
