I'm out of the loop.  What's the context here?

* get a bunch of these
* go to airport
* drop them into unsuspecting people's bags
* ???
* publicity

wait, you mean it wasn't invented by Spoony McSpoonerson?

If I understand correctly:  No, the difficulty would be the same so your odds of finding a block would still be very low and take a very long time.  But if you remained the only active miner for a long time then the difficulty might be adjusted down.  If that happened then on average you would be able to find a block every 10 minutes.  Of course with such an easy source of coins everyone would begin mining again and the difficulty would have to be adjusted back up.

The bot looks at posts with the right keywords.  When it finds one it puts the appropriate amount into an account for you, and posts a message with a link.  You follow the link and prove that you are you by connecting your reddit ( or youtube, twitter, etc.) account to the changetip account that was created for you.  Once you have some bits in your account you can tip others.

Does Gemini have an API or some method to buy/sell by command line without a GUI?

9-11 would still have happened, but we probably would not have invaded the wrong country under false pretenses because of it

Would it be possible to make one payment to view multiple videos?  For example, if content is divided up into traditional seasons/episodes, it would be convenient to pay for a full season at once.

I saw this on my local news tonight.  I would really like to send them some correct information.  Would it do any good?  If so, can someone provide a link with info to dispel this crap?

Thanks for the suggestion.  Before I sign up I want to make sure the site works the way I want.  I'm not a retailer, I don't plan to accept BC as payment for any goods or services.  I'll just be buying BC for my own use.  Can I transfer USD into a coinkite account, then later use that money to buy BC instantly?
