No usually takes about 6 hours for me but I never did it with BTC. I always read of problems converting BTC there so I use Wex to LTC first.

Not on gdax yet... remind me later lol ;)

Sounds like you have a watch only address in your wallet in which case you will need private key. If you don't have it then no bitcoins for you.

Yeah seems your right there this will bring some smiles for the new guys. I am glad.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:51:59
I would like to agree but I seriously doubt it right now. I don't see the support for it unless it appears when Asia wakes up in the next few hours.

Interesting theory thanks for sharing
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:06:06
You were told wrong. Bitcoin goes down and up. Wait 6 months and come back to us.

Wow thanks to whoever gave me the reddit gold. Never had it before. Very much appreciated :D

I cut my own hair.. more money to invest bro

We will see $50,000 this year. Possibly get close to $100,000 but depends on bureaucracy getting in the way.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:42:53
surely you can buy say on coinbase and just keep it there?
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:15:29
Haha I sometimes used to feel like telling people about it when its on the up and hindsight told me not to. So glad I never did and I don't tell anyone in my personal life about investing or about it at all.

And read comment to my topic. Power is up high and blocks are being solved quick time.

Wasn't posted long ago but its very solid advise for today.

I believe in cryptocurrency. Whether it is bitcoin is another thing. Its like saying the first fiat is fiat and the rest are copycats. Not true. This is a way of trading and there is no

Its already being discussed in the UK. To get rid of high street banks.

Sounds legit where do I send the 100btc?

No my family get annoyed at me for always going on about it
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:09:33
Personally I like Wex.nz formally BTC-E that got shut down in the USA. Not recommended to use if you are USA based.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:27:22
Hmm I don't feel the same sentiments if I loose what I can afford I wouldn't worry. If my investment earns so much that I would start to worry I would cash out some until I felt safer again.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:28:54
Lets just be on our way then 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:22:29
Newbies don't need to worry if they didn't invest what they couldn't afford to lose. So many times this needs saying. Its not a get rich scheme; its gambling really.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:56:19
In the long term it will make the prices go up.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:58:14
Yes sounds good to me. I never have problems moving my Bitcoins either. To much FUD around. It might be slower than other altcoins and higher fees but the system is designed to last and be as decentralized as possible. So those moaning about fees stick to your visa and free atm withdrawals.

Yes the bubble burst this month but someone has used a puncture repair kit. Good to go for another year.

Ever since they started filling the blocks up!

No its not right now  although its gone up slightly since I last posted.

Incase of FUD buy some more.

I will take a dump at midnight and come back to shooting to the moon thank me later.

I suggest you set a remind me on this as I am certain. I rarely post unless its positive.

SEC going to recognize cryptos as a legit digital currency tomorrow. Going to be a big bull run.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:47:33
Yes that would be nice. I would love to buy a property with Bitcoin itself. Many places here are allowing this now. Its a real possibility :\)

US SEC Chairman Jay Clayton:
"As I have stated previously, these market participants should treat payments and other transactions made in cryptocurrency as if cash were being handed from one party to the other."
