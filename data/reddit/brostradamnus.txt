We are not in a bear market. Bitcoin is going down in value because more sellers than buyers exist in the market.

Oh I'm here to have a discussion for sure. You won't get personal attacks from me in any way. I'd like very much to understand your perspective and all the other users of this terms perspective. I don't understand why we need to have these terms. They seem to lack utility. You wrote: 
"its not the time they were born. It's the attitude that is being dismissed". Then you say that two groups Gen Y and Gen Z have learned something about the boomer group. Are these two other groups of individuals determined by the year of birth or can these other groups also be defined by an attitude or actions?
Please expand on your definition of Gen Y and Z.

I was offended first. I'm the victim here.

I approve of this meme

I am offended by the sudden movement to dismiss an entire generation of people due to what era of time they were born in. It's not tasteful and it's suddenly everywhere.

In my case I feel like I saw this meme suddenly emerge from  types who funny enough are all born between 1946 and 1964.

Almost nobody alive today was around when the Federal Reserve system was established. Almost no one knows it used to be illegal to own gold. The problem is not age. Everyone alive now has only lived in a time where a few dominant media sources establish the "truth".

Criticism is an analysis of something's faults and merits. In some uses you could argue it's equal to disapproving of something.
 "OK boomer" is a communication ending  declaration that the target is a member of a lesser class of society and an opposing subgroup. The meme is a tool for anyone who wants to express lazy narcissism.

I was probably in highschool smoking weed. 
Divide and conquer is not new.
Generations? Or multinational media conglomerates?

This is why I only hold onto Bitcoin through Robinhood. Because I know I am too careless.

No it just requires cash to buy this dip.

If the dollar isn't the world trading standard currency it could be Bitcoin or Gold instead. That doesn't mean the dollar disappears.

Bitcoin wont comfort you like canned chicken after a comet hits Kazakhstan.

I think it could be a fun way to make a statement if the object of a game was to collect bitcoins but most of the things that were easy to collect were various Fiat currencies. Then you could simulate inflation. 
I imagine a player could be faced with a dilemma between choosing to proceed at low health or resting to proceed at full health which would allow their accumulated Fiat to depreciate.
