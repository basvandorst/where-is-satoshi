Thanks for your reply!
"Those fringe cases where they hold a lot but haven't worked out how to get out tax free likely don't have the ability to or don't care."
Didnt quite get the point though. Do you mean to say that not paying taxes on cryptos is very easy right now? because i have the opposite impression.

Lets say i live in Monaco, couldnt I just go to a country where Cryptos are taxable and help people cashing out with cash on hand in a legal way? Whether the person from whom I bought the cryptos declare the money i gave them is not my business anymore.

I didnt realise how dumb it was the question until I actually thought about it. However different countries, different rules, germany happens to oblige people who hold cryptos for less than a year to include profits in their tax returns.
as for percentages
"No income tax is charged on the basic allowance, which is €8,354 for unmarried persons and €16,708 for jointly assessed married couples. Beyond this threshold, the marginal tax rate increases linearly from 14% to 24% for a taxable income of €13,469 (€26,938 for married couples). In the subsequent interval up to a taxable income of €52,881 (€105,762 for married couples), the marginal tax rate increases linearly from 24% to 42%. The last change of rates occurs at a taxable income of €250,730 (€501,460 for married couples) when the marginal tax rate jumps from 42% to 45%. The course of the marginal tax rate and the resulting average tax rate are depicted in the graph to the right."
This is the answer i was hoping for.. but hey, mocking is more productive.
