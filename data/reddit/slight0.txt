Then how will bitcoin ever be decoupled from the dollar if a nation can't use it as its sole currency? There are many people who are advocating for total bitcoin adoption in the future.

I like the look, but bitcoin cold wallets are just offline storage of bitcoin. They are temporary and can hold an arbitrary amount of bitcoins that can change over time.
Taking that into consideration, putting a bitcoin amount on the wallet itself makes it look too much like actual paper money and is misleading. There's absolutely nothing guaranteeing that there is 100 BTC at that address at all times.

The entire purpose of the colony is to help the queen survive and mate. A colony is worthless without a queen and **cannot** survive without one.

Yes, I wasn't born yesterday as you assume.
More importantly, good news should make people hold their bitcoin instead of dropping it at the drop of a hat. Also, more positive news surrounding it should mean more users which means more income. Positive news should also encourage companies accepting bitcoin to hold more of their bitcoin income instead of immediately withdrawing it form the market.
All of this together, should make the price steadily climb. No "magic" money makers required.

I'm guessing it'd be because those coins have no direct value and it would take ages to launder even a small amount of money. Way too impractical.
You'd have to put all that money into the token machine, play games with those tokens, trade the resulting tickets in for prizes, then sell the prizes for money. All the while seeing a huge reduction in profits due to both time spent and the fact that the money put in is more than the money out. ($20 of tokens in order to win some shitty toy worth $5)

Yes but bitcoin draws a certain kind of crowd. It draws in a more youthful crowd (as OP stated he is a student) whereas normal stock trading is a bit more of an adult thing that you do with a professional and when you have a lot more money. It also draws in the IT crowd which is how I got into it.
The bitcoin market is also much more interesting then any market I've seen.

I get what you're saying but you're actually proving my point.
Twenty years ago it *would* have been too good to be true. If I had came up to you and offered you a service like the one you speak, it probably would have been a scam since that tech didn't exist yet.
There is a timeline and rate of progress for things. I'm not saying anything is or isn't possible. I'm saying when something, out of the blue, appears to be waaaaay better than anything else out there. It might be too good to be true and your best bet is to proceed with skepticism and not invest too much unless you know what you're doing.

* bitcoin CEO suicide - **1) She wasn't a CEO of bitcoin she was a CEO of a bitcoin exchange/technology company. 2) How was this a fault of bitcoin? What woes did bitcoin bring her to the point where suicide was the option? Answer: This has nothing to do with bitcoin**
* The bitcoin foundation being revealed a den of theives, Shrem arrested. - **lol**
* The IRS ruling that every single miner owes a shit load of taxes now, even back taxes, whether they have ever sold a bitcoin or not. - **No one will be paying for back taxes and bitcoin mining WAS ALREADY TAXABLE BEFORE THIS. You can't make money in the US without it being taxed. That's how it has always worked no exceptions...**
* The IRS ruling that makes bitcoin essentially useless as a currency without making every single user technically a tax dodger subject to fines and penalties - **what**

No, that's you boiling them down and stripping away the logic and reason to make those arguments seem irrational. You then attack that boiled down and stripped argument as if it was the one that was originally made when really it's a straw man.
Banking isn't going away because there has not yet been one proposed alternative to banks. Bitcoin is not the answer to banks in any way shape or form. It is a catalyst to an *improved* financial infrastructure, may greatly strengthen the global financial network, and perhaps even alter the way banks operate, but the assertion that it somehow renders the services that banks provide obsolete is totally unfounded.
It really has nothing to do with the fact that banks have been around for a long time, although it does lend the banking system some validity.

You've been putting zero effort until now and I'm the troll? I've had to repeat myself multiple times before you actually responded to my points. Yeah I'm the troll bud.
Here's what you should learn from this: Every single generated address has a private key associated and therefore a wallet associated with it. You cannot have an address without a corresponding private key. There is a bit of a technical difference but its not at all wrong to consider an address a wallet in a general sense.

Oh I see what's going on here. The way I see it, wallet and address are synonyms. I can send to your wallet from my wallet or I can send to your address from my address. The words both reference the same concept.
Just because *you* don't own a particular address doesn't mean its not a wallet. Plus I never at any point said you can send from these wallets, I explicitly stated you can only deposit to these wallets. I then, said you must "send to any BTC address with the *send/receive function*".
Just because you found my wording confusing doesn't mean it was technically inaccurate or false in any way.
I also strongly recommend you see wallet and address as synonyms otherwise you're going to encounter more confusion down the road.

Maybe *most* established businesses do have the right tech but not all. Some small businesses don't. Even if they did, transactions occur between person to person or person to organization that aren't digital and are very frequent.
No one is going to fully adopt a currency that imposes considerable restrictions on when and where they can use their money.

Wrong. Gox will implode because everyone will withdraw their funds from it because the exchange itself is bad. They will then put their money back into other exchanges. This and the fact that the other exchanges are still functioning normally will prevent any imploding.

I seriously couldn't get through the article. It seems to be off in space, totally detached to anything that's going on right now. The article also doesn't attempt to explain what it's talking about when it introduces the M of N concept. It just drops it on you then starts rambling on about some hypotheticals. I've read things on M of N transactions and they are never grounded; never brought out of the theory space down to earth where real implementations are hypothesized and actual problems are solved.
This kind of talk reminds me of MasterCoin. Its abstract sounds good and claims to have the potential to solve a lot of pressing issues with the bitcoin infrastructure and yet no one understands how it works. Not even the developers themselves who outsource work to others all while sitting atop a protocol that could be actively exploited to do double sends with little resources. You couldn't even reliably send mastercoins to people and be 100% certain the coins would arrive on the other side.

Just a little confused as to what this really means in terms of change. Before this statement from the IRS you still had to report bitcoin earnings as income did you not?

It won't be able to take over a single one with this restriction.
Why be so initially pessimistic? The future is pretty uncertain, why not try to brain storm a little before we rule out the possibility of total adoption?
In the end, its what the people want, not what the government wants in free countries. The government can still have their taxes and regulations, there's nothing stopping that.

Gox's existence has caused and will continue to cause more harm to bitcoin than its downfall. Cutting out weak links can only be a good thing in the long run.
Since when did we give a shit about the mass media anyway? Media outlets that are biased against bitcoin will always be looking for ammo to shoot it down. Media outlets that are neutral or for bitcoin will always look on the positive side and get the actual facts and views of both sides of the situation. Gox staying up or falling won't change the media game.
Besides you saying "better hope it stays up" sounds like a threat. Like we better not stop using Gox otherwise X, Y, and Z bad things will happen. Gox doesn't have any visa to screw up as many times as it likes because it'll "look bad if it fails". Who cares how it looks? We aren't marketing a product to the masses, we're establishing a strong infrastructure for bitcoin. If people aren't smart enough to see what's happening, they will get left in the dust as always.

I've only been trading BTC for a few months and I **instantly** recognized Gox as pure crap. Easily categorized it as the worst exchange for a multitude of clear reasons. They made the decision extra easy when they took over a month to verify my account while all other exchanges took no longer than a week.
I have sympathy for those locked into the Gox game, I really do, but to say none of the blame falls on them, to say they didn't have ample warning to get out of a bad exchange, is just denial.

Bitcoin banks don't defeat the purpose of the blockchain because it was never meant to eliminate banks in the first place. I mean, if that is indeed what you're saying, then you're just as uninformed as you claim those "mindless believers" are.
Bitcoin banks would be slightly different than current ones and would still maintain low fees; they would be more flexible while still providing a lot of the things modern banks provide.
There are a lot of serious problems that banks offer a solution to. Bitcoin in and of itself does not offer a solution to most of these problems. People aren't suggesting bitcoin banks in order to make bitcoin popular. They are speculating that they will be an inevitable outcome of wider bitcoin adoption.

You're misunderstanding this I believe. The transaction ID can change because the transaction has not been sufficiently confirmed. I'm not sure this can possibly be prevented in a distributed processing network like bitcoin. The latency between nodes is the only "problem" here so its not actually a flaw just an unfortunate inconvenience.
The fact is, we can't stop someone from spending in one place on the network then spend the same inputs on another transaction somewhere else in the network. This has always been in the nature of bitcoin technology.

So in your mind, because the ant queen isn't directly issuing orders to the ants it must be decentralized? As someone who has owned an ant colony and queen and knows way too much about ants, I have always seen an ant colony as a sort of one-time insect monarchy.
The entire purpose of an ant colony is to support the queen so it can reproduce. Ants will huddle around the queen to protect it if threatened, will feed it when it's hungry or mating, and a whole slew of other functions that hinge around the queen. There are some species of ant where there is no single queen, perhaps that would be a better example of decentralization. Just because the individual ants have autonomous functions that allow them to, say, navigate, that doesn't mean they don't have a higher purpose and serve a single entity.
Without a queen, the colony cannot survive and is worthless because new ants can't be created and a colony often will not adopt a new queen on the off chance one wonders in.
How this paints a picture of "decentralization" I haven't a clue.

You can't defeat my point by going back to some point in history then comparing some futuristic technology to people's mindsets at the time.
It doesn't make your point because you're skipping the entire transition period that came before that technology. Really awesome things don't *usually* just pop into existence without warning or foresight.
For example, if someone today came and offered you a change to pre-order a teleportation device for $1000 dollars or some I-robot type android that could do chores, you'd probably think he was full of shit... because he probably would be. That doesn't mean in the future it can't happen.

Not that I expect you to, but don't use them. Tell them so if you can. There is no rational reason to continue putting money into Gox and trading there.

I fail to see the connection.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:31:52
Technicalities, but in this context they're the same. Which is what I've been saying. You realize a wallet can contain one or more public keys with no private keys? You're denying the fact that its common place to use the word wallet and address interchangeably.
Every address has a "wallet" so you might as well say I'm sending money from my wallet to your wallet. There is no practical difference.
So again, nothing I said was false. When coinbase generates an "address" it also generates its corresponding "wallet". Whether you have access to it is another thing.
If we go by your definition, which very well may be a decent technical definition, then coinbase has no wallet. You never have access to the private keys at any point.

From a technical standpoint, while this is an innovative idea, mining bitcoins from the cpu is ultimately pointless no matter how many people you have doing it.
For example 100 GH/s would net you ~$13 a day at current btc rates and difficulty. (This is assuming no power costs since the receiver doesn't have to pay for mining power).
If each viewer mined at 10 kh/s that'd be (100x1000x1000)/10 = 10,000,000 viewers mining constantly to achieve that rate. I'm pretty sure ad revenue would be much higher than that. Even an extreme 100 kh/s would still be a million viewers mining **non stop** to get just $13 per day.
I'd also like to mention that cpu mining is so inefficient compared to the difficulty, that the electricity used to mine the hashes would be worth more than the hashes themselves.
What would be profitable however is scrypt mining which would be an extremely profitable alternative to ad revenue.

Your point is that he's comparing apples to oranges and it's a fair one. Visa isn't a currency it's a credit card company that sits on top of currency, or more accurately, the banking system which sits on top of currency.
A similarly layered system should be expected if bitcoin were a country's underlying currency and you'd probably end up paying a similar amount of fees.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:26:23

You can't just compare random numbers without doing proper conversions.
If a serious stock went up 9500% in value over the course of **a year** then dipped to 6000% over the span of a day or two people wouldn't call that a long term crash; they'd call it a short term dip because it only lasted a few days and is still a really valuable stock compared to what it was. Plus you're referring to more stable stocks whereas the bitcoin "stock" has always been volatile but generally increasing in the long term and any "shareholder" would know that.

The core of the IP protocol was the very concept employed by both IPv4 and IPv6. It was the concept of IP identifiers and sending datagrams that could contain a network start and end point.
The change from IPv4 to IPv6 can happen in place and is really just a change of number capacity. Functionality and concept is identical.
BTW, you can't simplify TCP/IP to IP. Not sure how you can rationalize that.

The same purpose a normal bank serves. So you don't have to manage and keep track of your own money and deal with the risks associated with that. People can steal your physical money just like they can steal your bitcoin wallet/keys. Hackers for example will be way more effective at stealing your money because they don't have to go through the system to get your money, there would be no theft or fraud protection.
I mean I could go on, banks do much more than that, but my purpose here is to ask how bitcoin will be exempt from all the problems banks solve with normal fiat. Not explain to you what a bank does and why people use them.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:55:22
Fraud and theft protection are not built into bitcoin. If I send you 10 mBTC for a package, there is nothing preventing you from scamming me by not sending it, not sending what was promised, or sending my something broken. There is nothing built into bitcoin preventing people from stealing your money either.

Why wouldn't they be? One person with 100 BTC can affect the price massively let alone the collective BTC of this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:25:02
Exactly my thoughts. There is nothing showing this is longterm. The price has taken a sharp drop the past half a day and that's a long term trend? Let's just ignore the fact that the price has been consistently going up the past few months because we're panicky and paranoid.
If you look at the graph over the past two months this has happened a few times and has shot right back up higher than before each time.

I love how presumptuous and pretentious people are with their downvotes. "Hmm I have no idea if this is right, but it sounds CRAZY! Better downvote to be safe".
You can run algos to see how much 100 BTC in pure buying/selling can bring the price up/down. These algos aren't even considering putting up temporary buy/sell walls to physiologically manipulate the market. 100 BTC takes you far, it can easily raise or lower the price 50 dollars very quickly.
How much do you think has collectively? I would wager way over 100 BTC.

His logic is asserting that banks arose because it was hard to transact them online and bitcoin alleviates that. I was just pointing out the fallacy of that thinking because the internet is not what gave rise to banks.
Bitcoin does not make buying things online safe nor does it act like a bank in any sense.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:59:50


What makes you so certain of this? If anything I feel less safe with a wallet on my computer because I can never be sure if my computer is compromised or not. Encrypted wallet or not, an intruder can easily keylog or scan my computer memory to get the wallet password and steal my money in a second. It often only takes one insecure computer on a network to put all other computers at risk.
I mean the FBI recently busted huge underground stolen credit card market which would be so much more prevalent and harder to trace if they were selling stolen bitcoins. The underground market, by the way, was HUGE, they were hacking legitimate businesses (like pizza shops) and stealing customers cards instantly. A blackmarket might not even be necessary; they were only done that way to avoid the feds and because hackers didn't want to go through the rigorous process of cashing stolen cards manually.


A lot of businesses deal through banks (checks) and will not make deals with cash. My father and grandmother both own medium sized businesses and this is the case with both of them. You can't make online purchases with cash for example.
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:53:17

They can work with localbitcoins who can prove that the receiving address was owned by an account authenticated as the legitimate buyer. Further, if the buyer wasn't using a proxy at the time (or perhaps even if he was) the IP address associated with the buyer's address can be linked to an ISP account which will give the exact billing address of the buyer. Though this would require an mild investigation be done the behalf of the cyber criminal police department.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:58:59
While its true that bitcoin is easily transacted online, that doesn't negate the need for banks.
Banks were around long before the internet after all.
At the minimum you're going to need a reputable third party to do a transaction between two people.

Yes, but is it really going to be that easier 7 days a week vs 2-3 days a week? A bar is a bar, you might have more shots at it but was it *easier*. The jury is out I tell you!! Or perhaps its just semantics.

That was my thinking, that brick and mortar banks wouldn't be as prevalent. That doesn't change the fact that banks would still be banks. They'd just be more virtual but have the same properties.
You realize banks aren't just a safe place to put money. They are an intermediary between you and buyers, a shield from theft and fraud. How will we be able to ensure we get the goods we ordered with bitcoin from some commodity seller? An online deposit box won't protect me from theft either. What if someone steals my account info to that deposit box and bankrupts me instantly? Will that deposit box work in a system of other deposit boxes to reverse the transaction? If they did then they'd start to sound a lot like banks.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:38:11


Safer, but what if that computer is destroyed or stolen? No method is going to be safe, just like physical cash. That's where banks come in.


Good luck buying a house or car with cash. Unless you plan on paying it all up front and some people even then still won't take cash. My grandmother's businesses ships overseas a lot with government or other corporations and they won't accept cash or pay in cash (even if it was in their local currency). Any deferred payment is really risky for a seller without a bank. (loan, house payments, credit card payments, ect.)


What if the seller doesn't provide the service/product I paid for? Suddenly my money is gone and no one cares. Checks can bounce and so can the seller... with your bitcoins. Don't tell me an escrow is the solution to this either...
The point of online payments isn't just making your USD virtual, it's having the buyer and seller deal with each other through a trusted private authority that is yours and their bank. You can't do this with bitcoin alone.

Probably because bitcoin is all about who adapts it and uses it. For example, if bitcoin was mostly currency used amongst thieves and criminals as opposed to legitimate businesses, then bitcoin itself looks bad. On the outside it would look like bitcoin only has value to people looking to hide their illegal actives.
This isn't how I feel at all and I think it's a narrow minded and misinformed way to think about things. However, if it became a long term trend that perspective would have a lot more validity.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:49:13
Exactly. It makes it paradoxical to call bitcoin a "decentralized currency" when it inherently depends on reputable third parties to make even a basic transaction possible. It really makes no sense to call it decentralized and leads people to believe that banks and institutions won't be necessary.
While bitcoin will be easier to transact online than physical dollars, you still needs banks to do exactly what they've been doing. Fraud and theft protection, loans, credit, safekeeping, ect. With banks comes prying eyes from the government, regulation, fees, and more.
I'm not saying bitcoin doesn't have other advantages because I still like bitcoin. I'm just saying bitcoin is getting a bit overhyped if people really think it'll end banks, government regulation, and other BS we get along with fiat.
It's a good idea to we keep our heads about exactly what bitcoin is trying to solve.

Banks offer a guarantee that your money will be safe and a huge amount of other advantages over just keeping your money in your own pockets. Why would these advantages not appeal to bitcoin users?
