This. DO NOT SUPPORT FIDELITY. You can't just jump in supporting any business that says something good about crypto without doing any due diligence.
Here's a bit of a primer on how the owners of Fidelity make their money: 
TL;DR: Fidelity uses the retirement money of millions of people against investments made by the owners of Fidelity

I've been swing trading cryptos since the December highs and turned $500 of fuck around money into a couple thousand so far. The longest I held any single type of coin was less than 24 hours.
You haven't actually made any money until you sell to fiat or bitcoin becomes more commonly adopted as currency. Holding btc (in my opinion) is like handcuffing yourself.

That makes a lot more sense that they'd be trading alts. It just seemed so boring to me to get invested in something so volatile and not be trading it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:29:29
*Sitting?* E.g., they are rich on paper, but have to convert their holdings to something else in order to actually use it? Which is exactly what I was saying?
*edit: you changed your comment to no longer talk about people sitting on bitcoin, but I'll leave the above comment as is.*
I don't like giving exact figures online, but it's been closer to 12-15x in a five-week span. Swing trading a volatile asset in an asymmetric market isn't hard. I personally don't understand why anyone would be buying crypto to hold right now, but I'm happy take the trades against them.
As far as the people who have gained 40x, I can't go back in time and buy btc to hold in anticipation of market irrationality, so what's the point of comparing my market position to theirs?

Public knowledge that is so public that you can't even google it and link me to an article backing up what you're claiming? Definitely sounds like it's SUPER public!
Oh, also let's not forget that your original comment acted like it was some kind of secret.
The hardest part is admitting to yourself that you have no idea what you're talking about. Read about the Dunning-Kruger effect and realize that when someone is telling you that you know nothing about something that you feel super knowledgable about, it could be Dunning-Kruger in action fooling you.
edit: And again, I will re-iterate that banks *literally* can not create USD. That ability is solely possessed by the Federal Reserve, which then loans money to banks at the Federal Interest Rate. This is common knowledge amongst anyone who has taken an Intro to Econ class in college.

Yeah, it really is pretty fucked. Between the possible price manipulation using Tether to the more\-or\-less confirmed price manipulations in 2014 by Mt. Gox, I feel like it's impossible to know what the actual value of BTC should be right now.
Back in December, I setup a little app that sent an alarm to my phone every time new Tethers were issued. I would buy BTC and sell it (usually within 24 hrs) and never once lost any money. That is statistically impossible without something fraudulent, IMO.

I'm curious what it is about my comment that is setting off the filter on this sub? Mods? It's literally just information about the subpoena.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:42:56
Asking you to Google something to back up your claims is a loaded question? Holy shit, what a giant baby.
Is that what you say to your teachers when they ask you to look something up? "Uhhhh gee I don't know, teach, that's a loaded question..."
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:45:49
I asked one question: for evidence supporting your claim. I asked it multiple times because you seemed to think the answer is common, public knowledge, but that is the only question I asked you. So yes, that is what you are saying is a loaded question. You are simultaneously saying that the answer to my question is common, public knowledge and that it's a loaded question.
At least have some respect for yourself.

Sorry to burst your bubble Captain Speculation, but you really need to get outside more. Bitcoin isn't the protagonist in some dystopian sci-fi novel.
Nothing in what you said is evidence of anything--or even based in any way, shape, or form on factual information. You owe it to *yourself* to actually look into things (factual, *provable* things) instead of building narratives in your head that make the world seem like the scary place that you want it to be.
For example:


This is just one of the stupidest comments I've seen on reddit in months. Where in the world did you get the idea that banks can just create trillions of USD by typing numbers into computers? You sound simultaneously like you know nothing about banks or computers. Banks don't even create USD, they borrow it from the Federal Reserve. At least try to know what you're talking about at some point in your life.
edit: Pro tip: Anytime you start a comment or sentence with "Let's think this through..." or "Suppose that...", it makes it appear that you have little to no idea what you are talking about.

Looks like my OG reply was deleted by the mods, surprise surprise.
Here's a little more detail about the actual paper in question:  
Also, the outcome and purpose of the investigation into Bitfinex/Tether still has not been released. No government matter like this is ever resolved in a mere six months, just because you haven't heard anything new does not mean there was no outcome. The fact that they are refusing FOIA requests (as of 6/5/2018) about the case v. Bitfinex means that it is still an active investigation.
*"The letter cited one FOIA exemption that disclosure could impede their law enforcement activities..."*
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:59:21
Every day that we get further away from ATHs, this possibility seems more and more probable.
I've yet to hear a rational explanation for why batches of $100-200 million worth of Tether were printed only when BTC dipped, starting in Oct/Nov 2017. I've yet to hear a rational explanation of why they more or less completely stopped printing Tether in January 2018. 
Comparing when the large batch runs of Tether started and then stopped to the price spike in bitcoin is a very interesting exercise that will leave you with more questions than answers. I made a lot of money during those two months and cashed out at the end of January, but I can't help but feel like I profited off of a massive fraud.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:22:31
I tried to post this in another reply that looks like it was removed, but the subpoena and investigation are very much still active.
The CFTC is still (as of June 5) refusing FOIA requests about the subpoena and related case, citing the FOIA exemption that allows them to avoid disclosing information if such disclosure would impede law enforcement activities.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:36:30
You're commenting on an article that *literally* just says "A paper is due to be published about topic x" by saying that the article is making assumptions.
You, sir, are reddit in a nutshell. Didn't click the link. Didn't look into it at all. Just said "This is something I don't agree with, so it must be wrong and/or making false assumptions."
Here's a little more detail about the actual paper in question, though I doubt you'll take the time to read any of this either:

I did read what you wrote. You wrote a conspiracy theory about banks and the media conspiring to manipulate the price of bitcoin using their secret ability to print USD by the trillions by typing numbers into computers.
It's honestly one of the stupidest things I've read in a very long time. I think I lost brain cells just thinking about it. Like, what the fuck video game or sci-fi world are you living in?

In the US, the debtor (Mt. Gox in this case) is usually entitled to any appreciation that happens during bankruptcy proceedings. Since we're talking about a criminal proceeding (and a different country), I don't think that is the case in this case.
I'm guessing there would be a class that any appreciation would then be distributed to, but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:06:59


Dude, come on. Learn how to read or gain some statistical literacy before trying these kind of bullshit arguments. Where exactly do you think that the **composite reference points** I was talking about would come from? Literally exactly that. 


Again, you really seem to misunderstand the basics here. Tether is granted (usually in 100 million tether blocks) and then issued to bitfinex's wallets. From there, it is split into numerous different wallets. Our analysis only cares about tether and bitfinex--**where the freshly granted tether winds up after leaving bitfinex's wallets is not important for this analysis**. That is just noise--it can not prove or disprove anything with regards to this scam.
It is verifiable that tethers are not solely granted during periods of "high deposit activity," so you should really put that point to rest. If that were the case, why haven't any new tethers been issued since the 1/23? Trading activity has been through the roof and they've actually revoked 300 million tethers in that time. If there is an algorithm that only grants tethers in response to market demand, it is failing **miserably**.
If you want to believe whatever tickles your ears about cryptos that's your prerogative, but this is a market that is unregulated and currently ripe with fraud. People are getting taking advantage of all day in crypto markets because they are all so emotionally invested, which is really how you come off as well.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:41
Previous analysis has shown that Bitcoin prices move most dramatically in the roughly two hour window after Tethers are printed. Looking at 1-day bins like this analysis does is completely pointless. If he wants to disprove previous statistical analysis that implied a link between Tether printing and Bitcoin prices, he will need to look at much smaller chunks of time.
Think about it: if the pump-and-dump happens within a few hours, using 24-hour segments to analyze the market still leaves 20+ hours of regular Bitcoin trading to cover it up in each data point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:03:32


No, you compare the relevant data points to reference points. This is basic statistical analysis, not cherry picking. Why the hell would you waste your time analyzing data that isn't relevant to your hypothesis? The fact that tether is granted in batches (obvious because it's always granted in round numbers) also tells you that they are not solely created at times of high deposit activity.


The important data points are when the large grants of tether are issued to bitfinex's wallets. Again, you are getting yourself confused about what data is or is not relevant.


This is the exact argument we've been trying to make for two months--that this massive rally in crypto that pushed bitcoin to 20k was being propped up by more tether being issued than they had fiat deposits for. Now that they have stopped issuing new tether (last grant was on 1/23), bitcoin's value has dropped nearly 40%. The longer you ignore the signs of an obvious fraud, the more you cost yourself financially.

I'm not saying anything about fearing the government. What I am saying is that the basis of criminal law is a monopoly on violence. That doesn't mean you have to be afraid of the government--if anything, the monopoly on violence does more to protect you than it does to not (anybody who hurts you is going to have the US gov't after them).
But if you just tell the government "stay out of my business" with respect to laws in the US as the post I was replying to advocated, well that monopoly on violence that the government expects to have to going to fuck you right in the ass. If they can take down Al Capone, Saddam Hussein, and Osama bin Laden (among others)... I mean you get the point.
And if you want to start a new government, guess what? It isn't going to work without that monopoly on violence.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:17:15






Modern public law hinges on the government having a monopoly on violence in the state. Unless your plan is to out-violence the US military, you can't just tell the US government to stay the hell out of your business.

@_date: 2018-02-05 18:31:51


what?? 
1. Yes, it is still a pump-and-dump. There is no time-requirement for a pump-and-dump. It is actually far easier to pump-and-dump in crypto because of the volatility and relatively small trading volume. You can pump the price more in hours than you'd be able to in days/weeks of a traditional stock. 
2. By nature every single trade affects future trading activity so I'm not sure what you are even trying to say. Of course it affects future trades that day. What I was saying in my previous post is that the other 20+ hours of trading will help to cover up the fraud in you only look at 24-hour chunks of time. This is basic statistics. 
edit: For example, if 90% of the data that goes into each of your data points is noise (e.g. not statistically significant), then your analysis will naturally come to the conclusion that there is no correlation between those data points. There isn't enough resolution between each data point to find the meaningful statistical correlation in the other 10% of data. This is not overfitting; it is statistical analysis. There is more than enough market data points that you can go to much lower resolutions without having to risk overfitting.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:52
The likely-fraudulent activity has been shown by someone who spent way more time on it and put in far more statistical rigor than I would in a reddit post. You need to take small windows around the time that tether is issued (one-hour, two-hour, etc.) and compare it to a composite reference of normal trading activity for the same amount of time. 
This posted analysis uses methodologies which by nature will not find the fraudulent activity in this particular dataset. The p-values for the daily bitcoin prices and the number of tether printed each day are very likely going to imply no/negative correlation. It shouldn't take any analysis to know that--all you need to know is how a p-value is calculated and the data that you are analyzing/null value you're going to compare it to. 
Then he tests the hypothesis that the changes could be taking multiple days to manifest themselves, which is, again, not a valid rebuttal to the claim that tether moves the market in two-hour windows after issuance.
