A bit far from 30-35% like you are claiming. This method is also arguably faster and less hassle than using Purse.io. Sites like cardhub also let you set your own price for Amazon Gift Cards and it seems the majority of people on there are selling for less than 15% discounts. 
As a matter of fact only 3 people on there are selling their gift cards at a discount greater than 20% and I'd reckon they are likely scammers.

There are literally dozens of users with 20+ orders like that open.
That is maximum 50% discount and he only buys giftcards. Totally legitimate right? He also has 1000+ orders fulfilled.


Extremely low discounts as Amazon Gift Cards are unsurprisingly high in demand. Most of the legitimate sites will sell them at only 1-2% discounts.


Yeaaaaah no. In order to purchase an item off Amazon for someone else using either Gift Card or Credit Card you need to provide personal information. If someone really wanted to trace it back to you, they could do it easily.

"Since I saw that red car going 100mph once, I can only assume the car can only drive at 100mph." Stop being ignorant.
Nonequivalent. It's more like "I saw the same red car driving 100mph every day this month, therefore I can only conclude it drives at 100mph all the time." While your assumption is "I have only seen this red car drive at 100mph, but I'm going to assume he normally drives at 30mph for no reason." 


Cash in person, prepaid Visas, Bitcoin ATMs, localbitcoins, mining it even (although not fast at all). 


To name one, when you assume this Purse user got all his feedback from orders other than this 50% gift card. Do you even know what an assumption is? Literally all of your posts in this thread contain assumptions. 




Assumption.

What kind of nonsensical idiotic comment even is this? What data have you seen then? Care to share it? What does the data say instead then? What "this" are you even referring to, that OP said there are scammers on Purse.io?

In the same way you are making the assumption of the opposite? I don't see the data that supports your view either, but seeing that this user only has offerings up for that one $50 gift card at the maximum discount, it is much more likely that most of his feedback is from the same item.


If anonymity and privacy were the main concerns of these people there are much better ways to maintain that instead of using Purse and Amazon. This includes methods that are both cheaper and faster. In about every one of your comments you complain about people making assumptions but you yourself seem to be the most guilty.

Absolutely absurd. Even if you just go to the Earn page on Purse.io there are about 10 users each with 20 orders set at the maximum 50% discount. And they all have 200-300+ feedback so it they're definitely being fulfilled. All likely fraud and laundering. 


No they're not. Just google it, you can buy and sell Amazon gift cards everywhere including eBay, cardpool, etc. It's more likely that these gift cards were acquired illegitimately and are now being laundered for BTC. Don't believe me? Google "carding amazon gift cards" and you will see how easy it is to steal these. They only recently updated their payment processing system to be more secure early this year since people were using stolen credit cards to buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of gift cards before.


EXTREMELY unlikely that you will find many people on Purse.io who fit all these criteria. Considering most of the users of the site are from USA, Canada, and the UK which are all countries who **do** have access to multiple easier, cheaper and faster ways to convert USD/CAD/GBP to BTC. If you have a credit card in most countries, there is a better way for you to buy BTC.
