Bitcoin and other established currencies are collateral damage. The problem is the altcoin scams.

The amount of lightning hype alone will increase the value of bitcoin.

Sparkling wine is a thing. Champagne is literally just carbonated wine.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:41:06
This looks cool but can someone explain to me what I’m looking at?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:19:06
Incredibly dumb. Why post the ticket number here? It’s not like we’re Bittrex support. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:45:26
blunt yet correct
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:01:04
I’d assume so unless they implement it also, which I assume they’re fully capable of doing.
I think BTC on LN will shake up the whole cryptocurrency landscape.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:39:46
What happens with a failed transaction? Are funds returned after a period of time, if unclaimed by any party?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:59:14
Sorry, I shouldn’t have used the word “just”
It’s literally a wine.

I’d probably wait for one to reply and send it in a direct message.

Oh wow I didn’t realize nicehash offered a wallet.

I think there’s a 50/50 chance I’ll get either imperial or metric units when I search for recipes online.

No. 
Being made in Champagne, France is what differentiates wine from Champagne.
Sparkling wine may or may not be Champagne, however it is wine.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:32
I’m just curious about how someone could get proper fucked on this? Doesn’t Nicehash pay out every 0.01 BTC?
I guess $100 is a lot to most of the world, but on he scale of the hack it’s not that bad.

I think you’re confusing scam for unethical business practices. They intend to try to make Bcash the  coin, which is the same goal for any currency. By definition, that’s not a scam.
Their practices of market manipulation and hijacking an existing brand is unethical, but not really scamming investors.
Scamming indicates that they’re doing something malicious to investors.  I don’t think they are. They’re only hurting the community as a whole, which is just being douche but not being deceiving.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:36:08
Preference for currency design doesn’t play much a part in an exchange. It’s up to you as an investor to choose where you put your money. They simply provide the tools to execute your decision.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:11:16
That seems a little tin foil hat to me. I find it unlikely that they won’t let you cash out when they release support for it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:50:21
What part is the scam?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:53:22
They’re open about it, so I wouldn’t use the word scam. Douche, yes. Scam, probably not.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:50:28
I have ~10k in debt that I pay quite a bit of interest on. So... I'm just rooting for $10k.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:03:27
It is not *fully* centralized. This is the point I’m trying to make. Trying to pass hyperbole as fact is as disingenuous as Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:17:16
Bitcoin Cash isn’t Bitcoin, imo, because of its tendency toward centralization. That doesn’t make it illegitimate. It just makes it shittily named.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:05:01
I don’t sympathize, I just don’t see why Coinbase shouldn’t support it. Realism is important. This isn’t some high school drama, it’s business.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:01:04
Preference and reality aren’t always the same. Bcash is clearly going with a hybrid approach to centralization and, at the moment, it’s working.
If it truly wont work long term, then the coin will fail and none of this will be a problem. 
Don’t get me wrong, I hope it fails too. I just think circle jerking non-facts is irresponsible in finance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:48
My assumption was that coinbase prices were based on the mid market price on gdax. I'm not really sure, though. I'm just a humble hodl man, myself.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:18:26
BCH is the second most valuable cryptocurrency and they would be stupid not to support it. However, I hope they label it Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:07:54
You did when you expressed your preference for decentralization. Reality is that Bcash is worth 1100 USD on a hybrid centralization model.
Coinbase following the market is a good business decision if they want to make money. They can just as easily delist Bcash when it ultimately becomes irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:20:30
How do you horizontally scale a service that has to perform every transaction in sequence? 
Real question, I’ve been wondering this. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:27:59
Does a cryptocurrency, by definition, have to be decentralized? And Coinbase is giving people access to Bcash something like January 1st aren’t they?
I agree that Roger Ver, et al,  are shady as fuck, but I think the currency on it’s own is legitimate, despite it’s solution to scaling being short sighted. It’s value, like it or not, makes it a legitimate contender that businesses won’t ignore.
We’ll see what happens to Bcash price when Coinbase releases them. Hopefully there’s a dump for the “free money” back into BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:12:10
It’s literally not.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:38
Gdax is Coinbase, isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:13:32
Doesn’t that immediately kill scalability? Now you have vertically scale your database, don’t you?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:09:26
So this isn’t like Star Whores? :’(
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:56:40
What exchange should I be looking at that has a coin valued higher than Bcash but lower than BTC? Real question.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:06
I mean, if any coin hits 1MM USD, I’ll be a very happy man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:20
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.

I, too, hate having historical data points presented to me in a way that I can understand at a glance. Hopefully OP changes his UI to be more like a spreadsheet with timestamps that I can scroll through forever.
Although, it looks like he has 6 graphs tiled one one screen, lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:14:22
But there was quite a bit of fear of what a hard split would mean. Most people pulled their money out and stopped trading altogether just to wait out the result.

If quantum computing gets to the point that it can quickly decrypt many records in a reasonable period of time, a lot more than medical records will get totally fucked in the world.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:12:45
Medical records on a public decentralized blockchain makes total sense.
Currently, having a centralized database of medical records means those things are at the whim of the company controlling them. If that company goes under, so do all of the records. Just try calling a doctor for a copy of records that retired and closed his practice. In the United States, if it was more than ten years ago, you're probably fucked. Elsewhere, who knows. Maybe there's no law around it.
Simply because data is on a blockchain doesn't mean that the records are publicly viewable. Having encrypted content on the blockchain just means you can trust that the data has not been altered and that it can't be deleted / lost in a fire or company closure.

I’d be more interested in a docker image I can just pull from docker hub.
