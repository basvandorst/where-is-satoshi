What's BCash?
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:59:42
That's cool. Did he buy the old coin, or the new one?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:06:13
Because IOTA is not bitcoin.  Bro...you're a hard fork behind. The upgrades already happened Aug 1st. You now have 2 bitcoins. One is slow and expensive. The other is fast and cheap. To everyone who doesn't really give a shit about the politics..thats the bottom line. I wouldnt say the new coin is putting the old one to shame...but its making ground pretty quickly at nearly 22% of the old coins value already. 
Don't you see what's happening? You stand to gain the most from the switch. You could have had 10 to 1 last week, Now 5 to 1 at today's conversion.  It's MORE profitable to mine BITCOIN cash also..and has been for almost 2 months straight.(whattomine.com)Not to mention Bitmain ONLY accepts the new coin now. 
 I don't wish for bitcoin to fail. It would kill the market.  I do hope the torch is handed off smoothly, and the ticker remains BTC with the new speed and lower fees. 
So again...come on over to the faster bitcoin you've been crying for 2 years to get. Its not so bad here. Change is hard..i get it.  I HATE lifting the toilet seat. Why can't my wife just lift it to end the standoff? Should she lift it, or should I put it down? Now THAT'S something to argue about! The keg of beer just arrived. I warmed up the bunnies for you. I only ask that there be no "suprise" pregnancies this time.   
Let's not forget the real enemy here. Ripple XRP. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

I agree. The reason is because he's smart and diversified. He still has his fork cash and spends that on wild nights in Tejuana

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:11:09
What do you mean? Isn't it 8 times faster and cheaper? Isn't it like standing on line at the DMV forever....when suddenly they open up 7 more windows?  Yeah...thats a bad thing?  
You guys need to get over it.  Come over and join us in the flipping.  You can't stop evolution.  I LOVE bitcoin.  BOTH bitcoins.  One is 8 times faster and cheaper than the other....BOTH are bitcoins.  The sooner you guys accept it, the better.  Clinging to a slow ass coin that costs a fortune to pay anything with is retarded. Notice nobody calls it BCASH unless you hate it? Seems like an attempt to confuse new investors. That's shady.  You can't stop people from finding out about the new and improved bitcoin.  It's coming and you can't stop it. Now that it's on Coinbase as BITCOIN cash, the market will show you that I am right about this.  You guys on the small block side are so blinded by hatred you can't even see what's happening. SPOILER:  There's a new Bitcoin!!!

Or maybe he lost his secret key and Jaxx won't cooperate

What's BCash?
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:10:44
You'd rather pass the power back to the banks?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:23:26
Any new news? Has the fork happened yet? Is it safe to send coins back to exchanges? I can't see my BTC in my Jazz wallet all morning for some reason. I see the deposits tho, and no other transactions 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:40:08
Is it safe to move my BTC back to the exchanges to trade and diversify again?  If I trade some, will my BTH eventually show up in JaXx when they support it..even if I trade the the BTC now? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:25:50
Funny when it's not big news anymore. Haha. That's why I try to slack off as much as possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:48:17
Awesome! Thanks for the response.  LOVE the wallet! Big thanks
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:50:10
Hello.  Amy updates on Jaxx progress on supporting BCC?  I have been waiting patiently for mine. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:12:27
lmao. Nice meme����
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:42:18
So segwit is now live? This is huge!
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:32:22
NICE! Bittrex shows the BCC I now have. I forgot to move it, but heard they were supporting it. They are calling it BCC for what it's worth. Kinda weird they'd hijack another coins name. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:24:29
Im torn. I see Segwit as the future.  The platform for the LN, and atomic swaps.  However...I also understand it brings Crypto Currencies closer to centralization because the nodes are too big for the average miner to participate.  Am I way off?  
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:55:56
No. Not sure. But I'd be willing to bet you a turkey sandwich the pool hashrate more than doubles after the upgrade next week.  
Im still mining the old coin now. The rewards per block right now in slushpool have gone way up. It's an interesting battle happening right before our eyes. This is the coolest thing I'll watch all year
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:32:25
Same bad advice I got last night from a friend at work who would have cost me a good amount of money had I listened to it.  
Someone once told me not to take advice from someone unless they are as successful as you want to become.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:07:41
So you bought BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:18:40
In switching over our 150 tarahashes to BCH after the upgrade next week. Im sure everyone else is too. I won't do it until the network stabilizes after the upgrade. It makes no sense at the moment. You could mine all day for no reward. Plus, the rewards of mining the old coin are higher now that all the people are jumping ship.  My company is mining the old coin and trading it for the new bitcoin until the switch. I don't speak for all miners, but I can speak for what my company is doing as it relates to your post. Your fears are accurate. Embrace the change 
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:09:15
Because it's worth .10 now and rising. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:27:01
I think it has less to do with banks, and more to do with Bitmain and what Jihan Wu wants. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:53:22
So the key to fixing the scaling issue is smaller blocks? I've officially heard it all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:32:25
You act like you're actually buying them. Lmao. Who cares what you think. Have a nice day! :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:03:48
What shitcoin are you referring to? Just curious..
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:00:59
Not yet. I don't plan on keeping up with Jihan, but I wouldn't mind a few table scraps��
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:10:57
What's the point of posting my rewards question? I've had a ton of questions as the process has evolved. We've come a long way from trying to plug in 3 s7s in my buddies basement and popping the circuit 2 years ago when 2 s7s would earn you nearly a full bitcoin in 30 days.  If you want more to know more of the noob shit I've done over this process, I'd be happy to share the story.  I've tried to pay it forward every chance I get. I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the help I've received here at Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:09:08
How did you know which bitcoin to use? They didn't specify if you could use the slow and expensive one..or the new fast and cheap bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:23:38
Decentralized like the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:10:29
True, but you haven't factored in the fact that I can't stay sober at casinos. You forgot to mention a plan b in case I decided to place all those chips on black. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:03:32
I like LTC right meow.....  Im confident it's going back to the 90s very soon. Sitting at 59 right now means over 30% possible gains.  Just one guys opinion...a

Hypo-Allergenic? My son can't eat peanuts. What happens if he accidentally swallows one of your "bitcoins"? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:44:57
Yeesh. Why the hate on miners? I have some s9s working to confirm payments for the network...and I've never felt so bad about myself. Lmao 
You guys think miners really care? I'll mine anything that profits. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:10:06
Because the fees are much power, and it's faster.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:27:13
That's pretty sweet! I know a lot of people don't like the new coin, but I bet some haters will change their tunes if they wake up tomorrow and find these free copies are worth 250 ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:55:21
I know it won't be popular, but Im buying some. Reminds me of ETC
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:10:18
That's easy. Use litecoin instead
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:11:27
interesting.  Any idea of how much they will be worth? Also, what wallets support it? Maybe I should do some research so I don't have to bug you for info. lmao.  Any advice or direction is much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:04:42
Are they just going to show up in my jaxx wallet somehow?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:00:40
As a miner, I have some concerns with Segwit. I fully believe Bitcoin needs to solve the scaling issue to stay competitive in a market where alt coins are eating away marketshare. Many alt coins can settle transactions much faster and much cheaper than bitcoin can at the moment.  I support the move one one hand, but also wonder how this will affect my business on the other.   If the blocks become wider to open up more traffic flow, does the difficulty of the block increase? If so, it will take longer to mine the block for the same payout?  How much longer? If segwit doubles the time it takes me to mine a block, it will essentially cut my profit in half if the price of bitcoin doesn't double with it.  Im going to keep my head down and continue mining while assuming the price will skyrocket when segwit is integrated.   
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:48:48
Great Article. Thanks.  Looks like Jaxx is calling it BCH also.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:02:10
If they spit and form a bitcoin classic or bitcoin core coin.....Im trading all my holdings to get in. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:04:19
Im trading for BTC now actually.  Then I'll move it to my Jaxx wallet. Any idea of how much you get per BTC?
