It is exactly as efficient as it was designed/calculated to be. It doesn't have to be as "wasteful as it is, it is deliberately set that way to fulfill a quantitative goal.
You keep speaking about it as though it's an unfortunnate side effect. It can change (and has been changed in forks), but it is the way it is so that a target level of security is achieved.

Not sure why this is often repeated. Past performance is a huge indicator of what you can expect in the future. It's just not a guarantee.

WTF is a bubble anyways? The entire world economy is "a bubble."
Any financial system can pop, implode, crash, you name it.
A bubble is just a pejorative used to create fear that something will crash - without being able to articulate why.

Why do you say it seems excessive? By what standard are you measuring? The market cap of bitcoin is well over $100 billion USD and to date hasn't had it's security compromised, so it seems adequate to me. What should the energy consumption of a $120 billion endeavor look like, and what should be the acceptable risk to that wealth?
As for the status quo, I was referring to the current bitcoin security paradigm, not a comment on worldwide wealth storage or something.

I guess it depends on whether you consider bitcoin a group of technologies and protocols, or just a brand.
If it's just a brand, bitcoin could just as well become paypal technologically.
 The core moniker does seem to dilute the popular chains brand (bad) but does seem to democratize it too (good)

The waste as percentage of all work is intentional.
The increase in hashing overall increasingly makes faking the system difficult.

Just another way to slander anyone looking after self interest.
Sad, considering this has the potential to be a huge win for the entire world.
Why taint it with yet another undeserved pejorative? There's nothing wrong with trying to make the best decisions you can when opportunity presents itself.

Yeah, I'm all for innovation and improvement. I'm unclear/pessimistic as to whether POW will ever be supplanted, personally.
I suppose energy per transaction maybe be high, assuming small quantities of money, and particularly compared to existing digital moneys, but no other digital moneys can do what bitcoin can do. We could always sacrifice properties of bitcoin to achieve lower energy cost.
Thankfully there is innovation coming geared towards making cost-per-transaction (in all respects) much lower, such as the lightning network. There is also a current massive offsetting of those costs via third parties facilitating centralized trades, so that non-ideal scenario also exists.
Long term, innovation will continue and I'm pretty confident we will solve all of these problems... I'm just not sure we'll ever solve the issue of using large amounts of energy to enable a trustless decentralized peer-to-peer money...

I wouldn't call it spiraling, but it's increasing, and fortunately that seems to be tied to the overall value bitcoin has to humans... if bitcoin were worthless garbage to us, I'd call it "waste."
Maybe it'll level off as mining rewards decrease, beats me. 
I tend to wonder how much energy, pollution and chemical waste goes into mining/processing/using gold, diamonds, lithium, and so on.

Maybe one day... but maybe one day we will each live on our very own planet and ride unicorns across space and time. Until such a thing appears it seems imprudent for anyone to slander the status quo.

Makes sense to me. Coinbase needs to avoid a customer support nightmare by ensuring transactions make it into the next block. The more savvy users understand the dynamics of transactions but joe schmo might freak out when a transaction hasn't happened for hours due to low fees.

Bought in at $4600, next day or two "chinese ban exchanges", and I watch it drop. and drop. and drop. And everytime I think it's at the bottom, it drops some more.
Took everything I had not to sell to try and at least buy more coins when it dropped even lower. Woulda probably lost out a ton if I had.
It's an interesting self-study on how such clear confidence in the good times can quickly become undermined by the FUD (and price performance). When it's doing well It's so easy to tell yourself that "Even if it drops it'll be back". 
But this shit can fuck with your head.

Educating involves a Socratic process, dialog, and verifying the outcome when you apply the lessons to various scenarios or problems.
Brainwashing is one sided, doesn't care for reason, doesn't care for dialog, and doesn't care for its usefulness to the recipient. It's purpose is to achieve blind obedience, allegiance, etc.

I assume he/she is assuming 100,000,000 satoshis per coin, and 100 cents per dollar, therefore on a smallest-unit-to-smallest-unit comparison, 100 satoshi's would equal $1.
Not saying it makes sense to assume that's the value, but I could see how someone would try and reduce it to that.

My examples predate scientific fact, and scientific fact IS based on repetition and pattern.

I can convert my fiat to bitcoin at any time, but still spend it on food, bills, entertainment, services, etc far more than I buy bitcoin. I think the case of inflation driving meaningless spending is exaggerated, but possibly matters in terms of wealth storage. Its already known not to store weath in usd though.

It can be. Or it can be useful and function in an advantageous manner. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:22:58
That's incorrect though. Almost everything we do in life is done because of past results. We look for patterns and trends and base our decisions on them. This is the reason you don't leave your house through a second floor window and instead use a door. This is the reason for thousands of years mankind could confidently proclaim the sun will come up tomorrow.
Granted, circumstances continue to change. The world is not what it was almost a decade ago, so results may be different... but patterns are revealing themselves that lend themselves to confidence in future predictions.

A desire to be rich doesn't supplant my desire to live a fulfilling and interesting life, provide for those I care about, and so on.
I'm all for preparing for the future, but not if it means I have to sacrifice the present. Last night I got to enjoy watching my son and 5 of his friends play Xbox one games  i bought at my house while I ordered food for them all and I would deeply regret if those moments were lost to greed. I consider myself fortunate to be able to provide the safe space for these kids and avenues of entertainment that helps keep them out of trouble.
Also, believing something doesn't make me right. I may believe I will live another 40 years, but I may also get hit by a car crossing the street. There are no guarantees in life.
Money is an enabler. Insofar as it enables my interests I desire it. If it all becomes merely saving for a day that may never come, it's no longer enabling me... it's hurting my quality of life.
I keep a lot of my money earmarked as savings in bitcoin. I also have a 401k, however "meh". I keep a lot of cash savings as well. Each has a purpose or reason.
I don't subscribe to an all or nothing approach in life, and I'm surprised that anyone does.

Bitcoin will never be a primary currency of any major country. That would be irresponsible and foolish to completely give up control over ones currency.
But all the same, I don't understand the relevance of what you stated.
I believe, as do many others that I know of, that the value of bitcoin will continue to rise, and yet I, as well as those I know, still spend on a variety of things regardless of that. I have many needs and desires I fulfill beyond the bare minimum, profits be damned.

Primary education is largely meant to be brainwashing, at least insofar as non-mathematics are concerned. It's more advanced school (high school, college/university) that you are meant to learn 'how' to learn.
I'm not convinced a non-brainwashing approach is necessarily best for rudimentary skills one learns in school such as arithmetic, spelling, grammar, and so on. The goal in those cases is to force-feed the basics into everyones head so that we can move on.
There are probably better methods to accomplish that, though, and certainly one size doesn't fit all.

Nobody wants to spend it because right now it is largely an expense earmarked as savings/investment.
The idea that nobody will spend a deflationary currency because they can instead profit in the long term is a fallacy.
I can illustrate this simply - I make a paycheck regularly and have the option to spend as much if it in bitcoin as I want, but still choose to buy things for entertainment, education, food, and so on, even to a great degree that is not necessary. 
If it were true that the qualities of a deflationary currency prevent spending, I would not ever spend on other things, instead pursuing profit exclusively by buying more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:28:46
If this is true how is anyone still spending on anything besides bitcoin currently? It's not like the option isn't there for them. All of the elements are in place for this supposed scenario and yet we don't see it occuring.
