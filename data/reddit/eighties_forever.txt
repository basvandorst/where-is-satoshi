Only one of them is promising fairly unrealistic things, though.

What the flying fuck...
You forgot /s, no?

For majority of people, perception is everything.
So yeah, they think they are free.

Yeah, I almost missed this because of all the price spam :(
Things like this are infinitely more important for BTC adoption than price speculation topics and wishful thinking.

I have absolutely no idea who the fuck you are, nor do I care.
Another random and wrong assumption. Sigh.

How much was it for the Goodman Library?

In 90% of cases, when people assume - they assume wrong.
Reddit pretty much reflects that as well.
Maybe there are people out there who are interested in Bitcoin as technology, rather than "get rich" scheme, and would prefer not to have to dig through the mountain of shit in order to find some actual useful information?
Yeah, must be a nocoiner.

I really wish there was a sub dedicated to BTC price posts.
Because this sub has really turned into shit.

Get ready for stream of mongoloid "noicoiner" and/or "didn't hodl" comments, though.
They genuinely believe that their wishful thinking and "to the moon" memes have any influence on anything.
I mean, obviuosly - it is not market players and whales taking us for a ride (again), it is picture memes on the reddit driving the price up.
Pffft. So logical.
