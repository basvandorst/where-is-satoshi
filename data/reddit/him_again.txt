This is contrary to what we observe in present-day defationary economies. Take for example the electronics market - people buy smartphones and laptops even though they damn well know that it'll cost *half* in a year. But they still buy in, en masse. Because they need and want it.
What inflation and deflation ultimately do to spending pressure is that they nudge it. In an inflationary economy people are pressured to buy and spend, but that doesn't mean they spend all their money as soon as they can. Similarly, deflation causes people to spend less, but nobody's going to stop consuming altogether and die of hunger.

We're each talking about a different kind of inflation/deflation.
You're talking about monetary supply inflation and deflation, which is the effect of an authority adding or removing money to/from circulation. Bitcoin is currently slowly inflating in this sense, slowing down, and at a hypothetical time in the future all emission will stop.
What I was responding to (WakyEggs' comment) was price inflation/deflation, i.e. commodity prices changing.
Responding to your last paragraph: the association you're describing is purely the effect of a central bank. In an unregulated economy, the opposite is true:
**Natural deflation**: when the total worth of the economy is on the rise, prices go down (because the supply of money cannot be increased), since there's effectively more to be bought with the same pool of money. As the economy becomes more efficient people get to enjoy more things for less.
Humans are however greedy, so they'll be likely to speculate on continuing rise and postpone their purchases to when things are even cheaper. This reduces the demand, *production is reduced* accordingly, and the uptrend stops.
**Natural inflation**: when the economy starts to drop, prices start rising. That's because the same pool of money can now buy less things. Good greedy people seeing their purchasing power fleeing will become more likely to spend, since their money will buy them less tomorrow than today. This increases demand, *production increases* as a result, and the downtrend stops.
This is how every free market works (Bitcoin is a shining example) and how it regulates itself, how it "finds" the optimal price of a commodity, service or even currency.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:00:57
Well you *did* have to fill out a crapload of forms (at the very least a bank account application and a paypal account).
With Bitcoin you just download and run an app. You don't have to do even that, you literally just need to "think of a number" and call it your private key. Hash it into an address and presto, you can receive and send money.

I only have experience with ownCloud 7, so YMMV (the current version is 8): ownCloud sucked at syncing big files over slow networks, because the receiving PHP (!) process got killed by the PHP FPM for taking too long to execute. ownCloud has no persistent processes, no daemons, it's all just PHP scripts executed by an HTTP server when a request from the outside comes in.
It's not decentralized, so a sync between your phone and your laptop needs to go through your server (or you could run a LAMP stack with ownCloud on your laptop... which is silly). Decentralized tools give you the ability to choose which dirs get synced to which machine, for example if you don't want to push your phone's photos to your server due to a lack of disk space.

That's still pretty mild. A few people I knew* put very large sums into 42Coin. Their logic was that if Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units and is (early 2014) worth $700, then *logically* 42Coin, ([not!]( capped at 42 units, is now super undervalued at 900 BTC a pop and will skyrocket soon! We'll be early adopters twice in a row! So it's a good idea to invest a few kilobitcoins!
It wasn't.
Edit: so you don't have to look it up, one "42" is now worth about 0.06 BTC (a loss of 1,500,000%). The entire economy is worth about two bitcoins and a sea of tears.

I believe businesses (or anybody accepting lots of payments) wants to either be running a full client (i.e. have a full chain copy) or go through a payment provider like coinbase (who definitely has a full copy). So either way local instant verification of input balance can easily take place.
Now whether current full clients (e.g. the official bitcoin-qt) or coinbase actually perform these checks on incoming transactions - I don't know. I'll try crafting a 1000 BTC incoming transaction and sending it to myself to see what happens.
Edit: OP delivers! :-)
tl/dr: no, it wouldn't work!
I created a 1kBTC transaction (using an input transaction that outputs far less than that), signed it, and set it afloat on the network. The first node that received it (my own bitcoin-qt) rejected the transaction as invalid.
Normally, a transaction has inputs (previous transactions' outputs) and outputs (the addresses you're sending to). Inputs - outputs = fee (e.g. you source 5 BTC as inputs and define 4.5 BTC worth of outputs, and the remaining 0.5 BTC becomes a fee for the miner).
So essentially, a transaction, where outputs &gt; inputs is essentially sending a transaction with a *negative fee* and every node rejects it.

They do! It's called arbitrage. This is actually what stabilizes prices between markets (exchanges), it makes them change in symphony.
You need to factor in hidden costs like withdrawal and trading fees, as well as banking fees when moving USD.
Specifically for Bitcoin - you also need to predict rapid price movements during the USD transfer. Bitcoin can be traded and moved pretty much instantly while it takes several days to move dollars (e.g. from mtgox to btc-e), which limits arbitrage opportunities severely.
Imagine buying on btc-e for $110 and then selling on mtgox for $120. Before you move the dollars from mtgox back to btc-e, the price *on btc-e* jumps up to $130 so you would make more money by simply waiting and selling later.

The rate at which coins are minted is very low compared to the size of the market. Even if every miner (not just ASIC) sold their coins every day (which is massively dis-incentivized by ongoing deflation), the price wouldn't visibly drop, or even slow down its climb. It's roughly 3600 new coins versus hundreds of thousands offered and bought on mtgox alone every day. New coins are a drop in the ocean.

Where are you? Or better, where is the car? I'd go for it but something's telling me you're sitting in the US and hauling that thing over to Europe would cost more than getting a new one :-)

Are you sure it's true calling Bitcoin transactions "instant"? Fast, sure, but instant they definitely aren't ("in under an hour" sounds more correct).

I'm probably missing something obvious. What's hilarious?

That's actually quite clever.

You can verify the transaction against the blockchain yourself (you do have an up to date copy after all), but this doesn't protect you against a double spend attack. You take the risk of a doublespend over long waiting for confirmations.
To be clear, I'm not advocating the use of raw Bitcoin for face to face payments. It is impractical for exactly the reasons stated above. I was merely replying to comments about the necessity of "waiting 10m for each client" or "typing down passwords", none of which exists.
There is a need for a peer to peer VISA like authority built on top. At some point the need (expressed in $$$) will be large enough to make someone actually do it.

So do I! :)
I hold a couple ASICMINER shares and use the weekly dividend (at an all-time low of about $50 a week right now) to buy Humble Bundles.

Aren't Google balloons dependent on GPS? And therefore unreliable in an SHTF scenario?

The CPU vs. GPU comparison ("how long does it take to mine a single bitcoin") is wrong, it should be the other way around. Right now it says that a CPU will mine a coin in 3 years while a GPU will take two centuries.

As for the mechanics of the raffle... you could
* 1) generate one address
* 2) declare that the 300th valid^x inbound transaction WINS!
* 3) make it public, have people pour coins in
* 4) which one is 300th can be transparently verified by looking at the blockchain.info dump
* 5) the owner of the address that sent the 300th will then [sign a message with his address so he can be verified](
* 6) you guys meet and do the paperwork and handover
x: a valid transaction would be one sending exactly (or at least?) 1.0 BTC

Looks more like a bug in Bitcoinity.

Then set up a buy order cascade to cover your bases. I've got buy orders for 10 BTC at $35 and $25, for 25 BTC at $20, $15 and $10, for 50 BTC at $5 and for 100 BTC at $1. Total of $2075 sitting over at Bitstamp looking pretty that's going to net me 245 BTC or 11 grand at today's prices if shit hits the fan.
Have another couple hundred bucks standing by in case you need to go sub-dollar :-)
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:39:28
What crash? The price dropped by a measly 15 dollars, *exactly as it should*, and recovered hours later, once the supply was exhausted, again *exactly as free market expected*.

All you need is to be lazy (i.e. not wanting to search for just the right kind) and not overly poor. Couple bucks and you're ready to go asap.

No. QC isn't some magic instant result computing. Only specific asymetric cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable (those that rely on factorization of large numbers... which are pretty much all in use today).
Hashing is an entirely different ball game. It's iterative (running the data through the algorithm many times).
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:23:15
After the next halving it's still gonna be 12.5 BTC per block plus 0.something in fees. Today's fees add up to somewhere around 0.25 BTC per block usually. If bitcoin goes sky high, fees will actually go down to keep the price acceptable (nobody will want to pay 0.0001 with bitcoins trading for $10k), so years from now it may even be 0.0something from fees, while block rewards will still be in single digits in late 2020s.

What if the depth graph (lines) are ghosted, i.e. there are more than one at the same time? Are the darker ones older (e.g. previous 10 minutes) or what?
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:03:36
Right. The address is a hash of the public key, i.e. a one-way mapping. Theoretically, one address can correspond to many public keys (as it is with all hashes).

That is correct, the poster however stated brute force explicitly, which is what triggered my response.

Realistically? The year will be [2140]( and nobody will really care because we will be using something else.

I've paid in some establishments with coins before and no such problems were encountered. The waiter presented me with a QR generated by whatever software they use over there, I scanned it with my phone, confirmed the amount and that was it. No passwords (I protect my phone with a fist, not a code) , no waiting (that makes sense with large amounts of money - not really a thing in bars).

Dude  buys an ASIC for 1000 USD. At the same time, dude  buys 10 BTC for $100 a pop. The ASIC mines a total of 8 BTC over its lifetime. They both sell all they have at $500/BTC. Dude  gets $4000, dude  a solid $5000.
It doesn't matter at all if he bought it with fiat or coins. He's net +$3000, but -$1000 compared to the guy who just held onto the most precious coins there are.
Note that this assumes zero electricity, upkeep and other hardware costs.

According to [the API doc]( they are now enforcing a 600 hits per 10 minutes limit (1 Hz averaged over 600 seconds).
Entirely reasonable especially in light of the current events.

For Bitcoin to fully move from a speculative commodity to a full-blown currency, it needs to have a significant market cap. Since emission is pretty much non-existent (the amount of coins in the wild isn't even going to double at this point), the majority of the market cap increase will come from the price rising.
To make Bitcoin a usable currency for international markets and online payments, it will need a market cap in trillions USD, which places a single bitcoin north of $50 grand. That's where we're going.
Plus a lot of people here have significant BTC holdings. Once Bitcoin reaches equilibrium (in the trillion butter zone), those people will have thick wads of monies in their hands.

You can see current trade volumes on exchanges, e.g. in the top bar on [Mt.GoX]( (currently 97 k฿/day) or the Overview section on [Bitstamp]( (currently 11 k฿/day).

When 1/10 of a coin is too pricey for the common man he buys 1/20.

Yes, this is exactly what people left and right seem to simply not get. If you buy a machine for 10 BTC and it mines (over its lifetime) you 8 BTC, you're still 2 BTC in the red no matter what they trade for at the moment, or ever will.

Why would they do that? Their entire business depends on Bitcoin being healthy. If weird things start happening (like illicit transactions going through etc.), everybody would just drop their coins and run, tanking our itty bitty economy.

Lol as you might, but a trillion is less than two years (695 days) away with steady 1% daily growth.

We've been experiencing more than that since February.

Probably not. It would become obvious soon after switching to Malicious Mode™ though, as invalid blocks would come exclusively out of your block foundries.
