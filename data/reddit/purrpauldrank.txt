This was my first thought and why I thought initially that the wallet had become corrupt after I encrypted it with a password as it is missing all the other addresses in it. It has the one single receiving address which is the one I sent it to.

You're right about that but I may have the seed for the wallet somewhere written down, I just didn't store them all in the same place. I don't have the private keys separately though as I only ever created wallets with 12 word seeds and saved the seeds on paper.

It is ELectrum and not electrum pro, I donloaded it last year from electrum.org , not sure of the exact date as I have now upgraded to electrum v3.1.3

Yeah I thought I must have done something really stupid untl I found this article
 
It might not be that, might still find out it was something I did but I was rather hoping it would be a corrupted wallet file rather than a hack obviously. 
I had multiple wallets stored and backed up in different ways for this reason and I'm so glad I did although I'd also just like to have not lost anything obviously. Didn't even know you could add scripts to a wallet until now, kind of handy feature I guess.

I didn't download the wallet, I think I created it but quite a while ago and had never used it and I just wasn't paying attention when I copied the receive address. The wallet only has one receiving address and no seed symbol in the bottom. I've seen an article saying there was a bug in electrum that let javascript change your wallet file if you had a website open and your non passphrase encypted wallet open at the same time. Must have been that and it's just been sitting there dormant for months. I've upgraded electrum now and going to transfer btc I do have in another wallet to a new one.
