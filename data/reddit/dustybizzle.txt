In the title it says he helped him buy his first BTC - I'd say that was a self purchase

Nice!!! Thanks so much, I was already a big proponent of your service, this just puts another nail in the proverbial coffin :)

Yes, moving into the account is free, moving out of it costs.

So don't use it then, no need to stand at the pulpit about it.
I use them because its goddamned convenient to just log in, click a button and do an e transfer from my online banking to it. To me, this is one of the easiest ways in canada to manage bitcoins for a complete beginner who doesn't really care about being totally off the grid, and who wants to try it out for a very minimal fee.
If I ever feel the need, it's not like I dont have the option of sending it to a paper wallet and closing my accounts, or even just not using them anymore.

When it's dropping you can just deal with it and move on with life, but when it's rising... uncertainty is terrifying lol

If you have spare money kicking around that you can afford to lose, go for it. 
Treat it like gambling though, because the odds are about the same. There's no telling what it'll do a week, 6 months or 2 years from now.
 Personally, I bought in at around what it is now (so im breaking even now finally) and only check it maybe 2 or 3 times a month.

Holy crap, seeing your name brings me back a few years. 
What ever happened to Just Dice?
@_date: 2016-09-18 22:25:12
Crazy! Definitely will check it out then - thanks again!
@_date: 2016-09-18 18:12:02
I had guessed that was the cause of it - I agree that the community was awesome in there. Had a few really fun nights hanging out and yoloing. 
Might check it out again some night when I have nothing to do and a few satoshis to burn on CLAMs :)

Holy shit!! I've talked to this guy quite a few times, he's a high roller at just-dice. Dude tips hundreds of dollars to random people in the chat when he wins, he's pretty cool to the community and has a decent fanbase. Never thought that would actually be his real name though lol

See this folks? 
This is why I love, and will continue to use Coinkite.
These guys are ON IT.

And I hang out with George W. Bush on the weekends.
Prove it.

Uhh... It isn't getting downvoted, it has 1 downvote. 
And 12 upvotes.
Fuck, it annoys me when people say that.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:24:38
Are you me?
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:29:57
This is exactly how I do it. 
I took a small portion of my BTC and gambled with it, but going into it, I considered that money a write-off. Had I won with it, I would have been up what I started with, plus winnings. Had I broken even, I'd have left in the positive, as I left with money I didn't expect to have. 
In the end, I came out even, as I lost all of it :p BUT, like you said, I paid for the thrill of playing.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:22:46
Wow, unexpected! Well then, nicely done.
