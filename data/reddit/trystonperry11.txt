I spent 10 hours of research, 2 hours recording, and 6 hours of editing on this video. Hope you enjoy it! Viva la Bitcoin revolution!

Sorry what?

Holy crap wow. Thanks so much for the edits. I will make sure to include them in the video. I am still very new to Bitcoin (about 1 month) and poured many hours of research into this video. And I don't even know where I would get a SegWit address from. So I will definitely look into it. As for the donation, I am absolutely speechless. That means so much! I can't even begin to thank you for even taking the time to review some of the mistakes i made in the video. Thanks so much!
Have a great rest of your day friend :)
Edit: I'm currently holding my bitcoin on GDAX, I have a ledger nano S where I plan to hold some, if not all. What is a decent wallet / exchange you would recommend?

Dude.... Bitcoin would have never gotten here in the first place if it weren't for adoption as a payment method.

Thanks for taking the time to respond! I really appreciate it!
Yea I've had a lot of trouble with my green screen in the video, The camera I used was also not meant for recording video. Thanks so much, I mainly put myself in the video so people would be introduced to me as I plan on making more education videos about other Cryptocurrencies in the future. But I may consider not putting myself in, or at least not green screened in as it looks quite terrible. So thank you so much for that thought! I am so glad you thought I was charismatic! Means so much you said that, that's what I strive to be when speaking. 


Thank me? Nah Thank you for watching it and taking time to give me actual criticism, I will be using it in the future!
