Yes after settlement you should be left only with USD...
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:46:41
if you bought ETC on margin against BTC then after settled your margin position, you earned BTC, so your account will have only BTC.
if you bought ETC on margin against USD then you earned USD, which would be better for you.
Just speculating but I think that's the way it should be.

That doesn't appear to be the wrong or the right number?
@_date: 2015-12-26 08:31:01
Exactly what I was about to say... Besides, a subtraction not occurring is also a matter of opinion because there is a subtraction of how many bitcoin a given pkey can spend according to the LEDGER.
While I understand why one can say "there is no subtraction happening", unlike luke-jr, I cannot impose my way of looking at the protocol, so I would not qualify any of those as wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-26 05:26:59
ok, let's say : 
"the unspent transaction outputs spendable by the private key of the public key of which the hash is 1xxxx in base58 is 30BTC" ;) 
I'm sure bitcoin will become mainstream much faster when using those terms ^^
@_date: 2015-12-26 07:09:48
well I created a brainwallet and put xxx bitcoin in it. 
the balance (according to the definition used above) of that address is xxx ...
If I use a wallet application, I can understand, but that being meaningless is entirely your opinion and how you use bitcoin and you should not take your opinion and the way you use the protocol universal.
By the way the number I described has something to do with an address, that's included in the definition, if you took time to read a little.
And if it is that irrational, maybe you should go explain this to about all the blockchain explorer websites that all use that terminology...

This paper kinda underestimates the fact that when miners start to shut off their machines, difficulty drops and more less efficient miners can join ... not all miners will ever quit because there will always be the fees to take... If there is a block size limit then youll also have competition with bitcoin users and fee will naturally rise.
So we back to the block size limit debate. Miners can choose a block size limit that would maximise their profits. -&gt; as many users as possible and enough limit to have competition for faster execution speed
... well thats my take on it

I think I did explain why since transaction being similar to receipts obviously exclude addresses from being receipts
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:08:24
This description seem pretty twisted...
Addresses aren't similar to a receipt, transactions are, that I can agree with...
Addresses would be the name of the recipient on the "receipt". 
The blockchain shows all the "receipts", so the sum of the receipts directed to the address 1xxx can be spent by the owner of that private key...
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:31:21
Doesnt make sense. You do not control the address that input the dust tx. That dust being spent doesnt give any information to anyone

Oh wow that's some hardcore destruction :p
But jeez if they start saying bitcoin addresses don't exist , that fully deserved...

I just implemented the random word generator you requested, just bang on your keyboard for a while (only letters and numbers tho), the app will then cut your "seed" in equal parts and hash them, then modulus it to point to one word in the word list (word.csv).
I put a ~10000 words list, but you can change it if you like.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:34:48
This is very basic to the bitcoin protocol and I already answered that. It is done using bitcoin qt or a script / program to facilitate it, like any transaction. If you want to know exactly how to do it you can check bitcoin qt documentation, basically Alice and Bob create one transaction to do so, and as the protocol requires, they both sign their inputs as required in order for the bitcoins to be redeemed, please note that nobody can alter the transaction or the signatures will not be valid, thus if Bob tried to transmit the transaction without redeeming his bitcoins to the transaction, it would be totally rejected and no bitcoin would be redeemed
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:45:43
You cannot theorize everything mathematically. This is also about psychology. If it is given that Alice will only sign the fair transaction, then maximizing Bob's profit would also be to sign that fair transaction, it works both ways.
Also your reasoning doesn't include that any of Alice or Bob can pretend to have incentive to scam the other. So which one will be the sucker? That's random. I don't see where is the power of Bob would come for always being the scammer.
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:21:03

@_date: 2014-05-19 15:54:49
OK I Think you mean Bob try to get Alice to sign a transaction that gives him more bitcoin than planned
This is the same problem as mentioned above by i8e.
Personally I totally would never give any bitcoin to a scammer just so I could get some back, it would make me happy to hurt him much more than the relieve of getting some coins back and knowing he got away with it.
Bob will have to find more than 50% of people willing to pay for his scam in order to make zero profit. Scammers usually don't like to take financial risks in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:16:23
Totally possible, and that intermediary company could do more, but it is going to take a fee, which is not the purpose of this system
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:12:40
Why sending to a charity address? Any bitcoin lost is creating deflation for the entire network. when you burn fiat, nothing is lost just paper. When you lose bitcoin, you don't even lose the paper.
But think a minute about this, not only it doesn't provide anything for the users, but what if the scammer just wants to push you to pay for a charity he is also willing to donate to? This is an incentive to scam more than anything else
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:17:55
You gonna need to convince UPS to be signing a transaction IF the parcel reaches an address then.

@_date: 2014-12-01 17:46:43
wow congrats ! May I ask how did you do that ? :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:28:18
Your idea to implement a diceware-like function to the app is actually quite good, it could help people to randomize and strengthen their passphrases. Added the scrypt hashing and I think people could achieve totally unbruteforcable brainwallets...
just 4 random words is only roughly 4000 trillion combinations, but if you hash those 4 words using Scrypt, then it would be extremely expensive to bruteforce, since you would need an expensive ASIC to bruteforce just 1000 of them per seconds (my i7 imac computer takes 5 second per 1 with N=20 for instance) in the other hand a cheap ASIC would bruteforce a 'normal' diceware passphrased brainwallet at a several billion per second rate at least, I think 1 trillion per sec is not 'that' expensive)
So coupling those 2 ideas might be ideal. I will work on that tomorrow so we can get the best from both worlds ;) If you have other ideas please share them :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:45:11
The signatures never goes online, at least not on the same computer, you can scan the QR code that gives the full transaction, including the signature, and review what is in the hex at blockchain.info/decode-tx
All of this on a different computer (or a phone)
So if the signature is wrong, the transaction is just not going thru. And since your phone cannot possibly be infected by the same application (since your phone never had my app on it) then the gimped signature cannot be retrieved by an attacker.
If you know what you are doing and feel like it is an interesting app, please open it on tails and test/review it or check that the code is the same as the one at pybitcointools. If you have the time to do it ... If you can confirm or (if my app is malicious) alert people that this is a scam, then you will be useful for the community. My only motivation is to be useful for the bitcoin community, so please if someone has enough time and knowledge to review this, it will surely help others to stop using online wallets (for instance) 
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:08:52
That is correct, but the other part knows that he aslo has funds at risk.
A risk means a cost... so the scammer has much less profitability, if any.
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:36:24
This kind of multisig is not implemented in the bitcoin network as we speak
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:35:55
He cannot, signatures involve all the details of the transaction
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:23:27
Hmm but this is extremely simple to do... why need so much development... 3rd party adjudicator is just a 2 out of 3 multisig, nothing special there.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:22:59
Your profit assume the buyer is just accepting a loss. Which won't happen all the time, when it wont happen the scammer will lose 1 BTC, trying to win 0.4, so that is why it is risky for the scammer to do so.
In your second example the buyer has more to lose, but still the scamming seller would have to find more than 50% of people accepting to release him 1 BTC for nothing, therefore he still is taking a risk.
Personally I totally would never give any bitcoin to a scammer just so I could get some back, it would make me happy to hurt him much more than the relieve of getting some coins back.
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:29:31
Alice and bob create the raw transaction, Alice signs whatever she is redeeming, pass the transaction with her signatures to bob, Bob does it too... No problem about that.
Maybe just need to make a script that will do exactly that if no other program let you to it easily. But I think you can do it with the console of bitcoin qt easily already.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:33:40
you mean at the end the scammer just decide to sign the normal transaction, so he cancel the scam and just lost reputation, time and energy. Plus as you can see, by refusing to give anything, the buyer made the transaction end up as expected anyways, so refusing to give anything to the scammer is the smart thing to do.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:11:12

Wow that is interesting ! why even bitcoinqt rejects it ??
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:05:12
Good point, 
The code that creates the signature is pretty small to read/compare to pybitcointools. Should take minutes I guess (at least to confirm that it is the same as pybitcointools).
Anyways seems like you know a lot about cryptography so would you open my app's python source code and confirm that the k is not insecure/compromised?
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:49:11
Good effort all about theory but hopefully this totally doesn't apply this way in real life. How about Alice send a scamming TX to Bob and Bob send a scamming Tx to Alice? They both agree to scam themselves? ^^ They are humans, not stupid bots.
Plus you go a bit fast with your conclusion, saying a 3 parties escrow will work better. I could say Chris (Third party) has incentive to send Bob an email to agree to scam Alice. If you forget that they are humans and focus on mathematical formulas only, it is just too easy to get something wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:14:19
So in your opinion everyone would accept to get scammed, knowing that the guy got away with it and don't care? Bob still needs over 50% of those before he can even get profitable. I seriously doubt he will find enough. Resent is a powerful feeling.
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:36:47

who would sign the 3rd signature ? this model is about no third party involved...
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:10:43
yea you got it, the transaction's input has to be signed by each of them... thats very easy to build a tool for that, but you also can use bitcoinqt.
Would you like a tool to do specifically that, its to say transactions with multiple inputs, signed by different people? I probably can build it for you on python
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:04:30
Note that using Scrypt reduces the number of words requirement by at least 2, for the same level of security.
This reduces the risks of loss by forgetting the passphrase, which is often underestimated vs the risk of theft by bruteforce.
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:22:19
This is why I say please review it and test it... and let people know.
Code is mostly the same as pybitcointools, you can check everything, just 1500 lines of code or so :)
I dont expect beginners to test it at this point.
BTW even if my code was compromised, since I advice to open it on Tails, no attack would work...
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:37:51

@_date: 2014-05-01 16:17:42
Could you share what is your regular brainwallet software ?
I doubt you tried the app tho... It definately is easier than using separate programs.
Also you can totally use diceware with my app, but diceware doesn't protect you against a bruteforce attack, and I would say it actually facilitate dictionary bruteforce attacks. Anyways Diceware is for choosing a passphrase, not for performing any key stretching.
To give you an example, you could achieve key stretching by yourself in a sort of efficient way by just running a loop hashing your passphrase a million times (electrum does a 10000 loop). but Scrypt is way more difficult to bruteforce (and this is why I chose Scrypt): take a look to this chart :  on page 14.

so you are damaging his reputation but giving back money so you can get ur coins back.

Well, my "best guess" is that you have nothing to back that (insane number of) 1M$ per 1T warpwallets.
It is even contradictory to say that "you would be impressed if someone could do 100 guess /sec" (your video) and at the same time that it costs 1$ per million guesses... But I guess it was a convenient (and sadly wrong) number to support your opinion this time.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:22:19
bruteforce is testing every combinations, words or letters... I have no idea where you got from that I was talking only about every combinations of characters ... I certainly never said that.
Hardware wallet with a backup are not immune to the stupidity of their users: is exposing the backup, losing the backup, losing the device + the backup, writing the backup on the device etc ... less dumb than choosing "abcdef" as a password ?
Yes the paper is from 2009, but it gives an idea of the RATIO, which may not be *that* different since we are talking about difficulty difference and not absolute difficulty. if the N is 2^20 then it is 4 times longer so yea the figure could be different, but did it go from 5 billons vs 1,  to 100,000 vs 1 ?
Again, I am talking about the ratio, not the absolute value per try, I know that it is dropping over time of course, 8 chr to crack, that is about 4 words from a 10k dictionary, and that is 5 B$ to crack in 2009.


Okay, so shall we conclude that in 2009, the ratio of the cost was 5 billion $ to &lt;100$ (&lt;1$ x 100) , which is &gt;50 million times more expensive, not 100,000... and shall we also conclude that warpwallets are not only "slightly better" than brainwallets ?
I would love to have an update of this cost ratio nowaday. But still, cracking a 4 words warpwallet seems pretty unrealistic already, so it requires a lot of dumbness for getting bruteforced. And Id argue that losing your money from a hardware device require less dumbness...
I don't think hardware wallets are a good idea because 
1: I have to trust a RNG (?), 
2: it would probably cost much less to an attacker to create a "fake" device that will just give me wrong 
addresses, or alter signatures for an undetectable "k attack" (, or what else), than bruteforcing a simple 3 words warpwallet.
3: I'm still not immuned to losing my bitcoin from stupidity...
If we ruled out every process that can't be used by people too dumb to choose 4 random words from a 10k dictionary, add a made up word and an email, then we wouldn't have any way of using bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:08:50
@_date: 2016-12-31 09:52:48


I reconstructed the warpwallet's algorithm using different languages in order to double check every warpwallet I do. So I do not need to trust a single output for my warpwallets.


so 1$ will allow you to find 1 million warpwallets addresses when it would take like nearly 2 years with 8 cores of my i7 imac at full speed??? (I used my java implementation of their algorithm which results in ~3 time faster calculation than on the official website) is there a way to check that number with spending xx$ and see how many warpwallet we got for instance ? Because Im having a *REALLY* hard time believing it... So it would be great if you provided something to back that number.


This is a common belief but in my experience, every single unexperienced person I would ask to choose an unguessable passphrase, and knowing they will lose all money if a computer finds that password, will choose an over-complicated password, not something simple... If you asked a large audience to do so, given that they would surrender some (significant enough) money if someone found their password, I'm sure you would hardly find a single "guessable" password. The reason is that they don't *know* how complicated their password has to be, but they don't want to get stolen, so in doubt they will choose something very, very complicated. That is also kinda confirmed by the fact that you didn't find *most* brainwallets, you found a handful of them, right ? Even it is many order of magnitude easier to find than warpwallets. And that is in line with your initial claim that at least "someone" will do something wrong
One reason I like warpwallets over hardware wallets is that I have full control over the entropy of my addresses, and I need no trust of any software or hardware because of my double checks, also, my passphrases, even with overkill entropies, can be memorised easily, therefore I will always have access to my funds no matter what.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:48:21
Its not "harm reduction", if you listen to the video he clearly says it is fine to use it, and it would be already really impressive to get 100 tries per seconds.
Besides, its a totally different thing to key stretch with this kind of ASIC resistant algorithms versus not doing it.
you could make trillions or tries with a small investment if you try to brute-force SHA256 based brainwallets, 
the same investment might get you to 10 tries per second for warpwallets.
So if by slightly less bad you mean trillions of times more expensive to crack, then ok we can agree.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:51:58
Saying its "1M times more expensive at most" is very misleading and simply false because the very purpose of the key stretching algorithms are totally ignored in that statement. It would then be similar of doing 1M rounds of SHA256 and the result would be the same, even better if I decide to do 10M rounds (?) ... Hell no ! This because you just don't realistically bruteforce anything except "very dumb" passwords if you don't have hardware acceleration. Making it virtually impossible to finance any decent bruteforcing. 
Leaving the dumbest of the dumbest warpwallet users only at risk, those are also at risk (of theft but also loss) with absolutely any system.
But the question is this : How many tries per sec can you do with brainwallets with a 100,000 USD investment (you could buy ASICS etc...) ? Maybe you know the answer ?
Now what result would you get from those 100k to bruteforce warpwallets, realistically?
The scrypt whitepaper  actually makes a cost comparison: 19 Billion $ for bruteforcing 8 chars, versus &lt;1$ for MD5... even if SHA256 is 10 times more expensive than MD5, we are pretty far from the 100k figure...
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:42:19
Still waiting (impatiently) how you gonna back your "best guess" of 1 million warpwallet address found per $ ... 
BTW yes the scrypt pdf is talking only about hardware cost and that is already in billions, you saying "comparing apple and oranges" because they're talking of hardware cost not electricity... well... let me ask you how much you think you need to pay for renting 5 billion $ worth of 2009 computer power running at full speed for a year, and that will include the electric cost. Obviously it wont be cheap... 
I think this is a reasonable claim don't you agree ?

According to Peter, we make jewelry out of gold and that makes gold expensive... (intrinsic value)
But actually we make jewelery out of gold because it is expensive. (show off wealth)
Failing to understand that leads to all sort of nonsense that we are witnessing here.

By the way the script is taking long not because python vs javascript but because warpwallet's implementation involves a hook that allows the browser not to freeze. If you check my javascript implementation, it should take the same amount of time as your python script but the browser will freeze until the warpwallet is created

Not sure what you mean, but no Bob and Chris cannot collude to get her funds.
The idea is to have 2FA with bob or chris, not without them.
Say they collude to agree not to provide the 2FA, then Alice would have to use her backup key; or Alice should make sure Chris doesnt know Bob

Same goes with drivers, and the proper answer is better practice. Cars are not bad, drivers could be, and 90% of people think they are above average drivers. BW are useful because they enpower users will full control of their coins. Choosing a proper random string is not a problem of BW it is a problem of users. 
Instead of saying you cant use a BW because u cant choose a random string, how about saying yes you can use BW but here is how you should build your random string... That would work too

I can educate someone for about 1-2 minutes and then I'll be sure their warpwallet will never be taken. So for all those "1-2 min educated people" warpwallet suddently becomes a good idea, not a bad one.

"No. Long algorithm MAYBE increases effective entropy (not real entropy) by a few bits. Even if it was 10. The effect is lessened as the requirements increase."
This shows how little you understand about pbkdf2 and scrypt. It is not the same as increasing "effective entropy by x bytes" it is about raising the price of work necessary to calculate each tries, which makes bruteforce incredibly expensive due to the amout of CPU and memory that becomes necessary to calculate each single tries.

If you are capable of choosing 4-5 words randomly in a 10,000 words dictionary then you will be safe with a Warp wallet. 
There is a 20 BTC reward for solving '4 words entropy (8 alphanumerics)'.
Add your salt for safety against general attacks, that limits brute forcers into personal attacks, which are much more costly.
Speed / key stretching matters because critical to determine the amount of entropy needed.
Brainwallet can be a great solution for being sure to not lose your funds in case of physical computer losses or scam from a wallet.
I wouldn't rule BWs out just because some people don't know how to choose random words, but do people need more education, yes probably.
And btw I think we haven't heard yet of anyone losing funds using a Warp wallet !

Good job doing the implementation, however the mistake you are doing is thinking that bruteforce is done by personal computers, when is done with ASICS, as bruteforcing any significant amount of entropy requires one, which is extremely expensive as you increase the memory requirements, and extremely cheap with SHA.
This is why if you build and ASIC that actually bruteforces something, you will need much more than 2.5 million times the money and therefore you need much less than 128 bits of entropy to achieve the same difficulty (in term of dollars) than a 128bits with SHA...
Remember : difficulty is the amount of work necessary to bruteforce, which is counted in dollars, or other unit of value.
and notice: I can have an ASIC that does trillions of SHA for pretty cheap nowaday, like 100$ per Thash right ? Well if I wanted a warp wallet ASIC that does 2 million times less, so about 500k tries per seconds, let me tell you that you would need some crazy amount of money, and that is true even if you replaced the SHA256 industry specialisation by warpwallet specialisation. The explanation to this is in the link that I sent previously 
Notice that with your interpretation of key stretching anyone could be just doing 2.5M rounds of SHA256 and that would be the same... which is -of course- wrong.
2.5 million rounds of SHA is incredibly less secure than Warpwallet

That is not described in this protocol, its a "multiple" 2FA.... not a protocol for after-death btc transmission ^^
Regarding your question I think there are many ways to do it the best in my opinion is to do an nlocktime tx (to renew every month or year) , or some other solutions like to allow family members to collude their pkeys in a multisig... (eventually give access to the 2FAs after her death; I'm sure you can figure it out ^^)
But this is a different subject

I personally verified that the formula they put on the page gives the same output with my own implementation of their formula, I always double check that both inputs give the same outputs and never have noticed a difference, so as far as I know it is legit.

I use warpwallet as a savings account, not like I am doing transactions very often, but when I do, I use an air gapped system. Also I use multisig 2 out of 2 and I sign with 2 different application so I'd be safe even if one of my computer / application was totally corrupted.
You're right that it is unfriendly but its extremely secure
@_date: 2016-07-20 09:25:46
Warp wallet's key stretching involves high memory requirements (and not just rounds of SHA256), you can't just base your reasoning on bits of entropy because you won't be able to include the memory requirement in it. Brute forcing becomes exponentially expensive given the amount of memory required. The only metric that maters is, in fact, the cost of the work required for brute-forcing, which is incredibly high regarding scrypt / pbkdf2 with warpwallet's parameters. Your reasoning would works if Warpwallet was just rounds of SHA, but its quite different.
If you spend 10 seconds doing rounds of SHA, you wouldn't even be close to the difficulty added in term of cost per try by doing 10 seconds of SCRYPT/PBKDF2.
I invite you to check this document:


Bruteforcing a 10 chr password would take 175 trilion $ and 1 year (with 2002 technology) if scrypt was used, with much much lower parameters than warpwallet's (N= 2^14 vs 2^18) and it would cost peanuts in comparison if you took the same effort with SHA256

Note that to avoid this situation, u could use multisigs with your family members or do nblock timed transactions.
