There is a wiki page, a developer handbook, and a few scattered resources, but there really isn't a coherent protocol definition because  the code is really the only definitive resource. Code came first, and the consensus critical pieces as well as implementation details are really embodied in the reference client. Every third party implementation has had to wrestle with this fact. It's a monolithic code base for the most part.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:53:27
You can assure me that I haven't worked on consensus code. That's an interesting assertion given that you have no idea what I have or have not worked on. Is the same logic driving your opinion on Bitcoin core?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:30:16
Um, sure. By definition at the same transaction rates its going to perform the same, almost all bitcoin transactions are non segwit, and so use almost identical code to Bitcoin cash. The difference is that if theoretically Bitcoin cash was doing double the transaction volume it would still work. I don't really want to have this conversation though, I've only been doing this since 2010, what do I know.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:32:53
That must be it! Please point me at all of the Bitcoin code you have written so we can exchange notes.

In this case it pretty much has everything to do with being able to distinguish facts from reality and make your own informed opinion rather than relying on third parties to tell you what is correct.

50kb blocks are way too large. You need to think about the chilling effects of centralization this would cause. We could not run Bitcoin on  toasters or on 1970s hardware, or directly on SMS networks. Since we want everyone on the planet to have equal participation in this experiment, we really need to be directly targeting non smart phones.
From my napkin calculation that means that the max block should be capped at 1280 bytes, or 160 characters in the SMS protocol * 8 bytes. Anything else is simply leading us directly into the arms of corporate and government oppressors and is in direct contradiction to Satoshi's orginal vision.

It can be throttled or blocked. everything goes through a firewall. They also don't have a ton of connectivity going out of the country to begin with, and lots of users.  The dynamic with china is very interesting, if we see the network fork it will most likely be the result of node density + mining power in China. The real question is how many bitcoin nodes are there in China vs elsewhere.  I don't think the way to prevent this is to artificially keep blocks small. If the economic incentive isn't there to build larger blocks and it doesn't offer a competitive advantage to do so for miners outside of China than it isn't going to happen.

I see. So you steal the info, wait until it is activated, and then spend the card. Whereas a blockchain solution would convey ownership and theft prior to retail distribution might be noticed or thwarted.

Interesting, I think we we need more info on the threat vectors for prepaid cards to make a determination.

You could absolutely infinitely divide it, just so long as you did it like a stock split and not like a devaluation i.e by mining towards a higher limit. So the value would halve and the quantity would double, as an example.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:54:12
You are right, I am wrong. I just went back and looked at the spec it specifically mentions this use case 
Audits: N(m/*)
In case an auditor needs full access to the list of incoming and outgoing payments, one can share all account public extended keys. This will allow the auditor to see all transactions from and to the wallet, in all accounts, but not a single secret key.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:44:21
Well you can make some assumptions, resource use is non-zero. A node servicing an SPV client has to serve blocks like the rest of the network, so has the same load as an additional node would have with respect to block loading + it has whatever the overhead is to match the elements of every requested block with the required bloom filter and construct the SPV specific merkle blocks for the client which include the merkle proof.
So the bandwidth to service an SPV client is lower, but the computational requirements are slightly higher than for relaying to a traditional node. I'm not sure about the internal locking that is done for SPV clients being serviced, or if that is done fully in parallel. Either way the block has to be retrieved from disk and potentially cached for other nodes. Further since you shouldn't trust a single node, one spv client may have multiple connections to multiple nodes to verify transactions.
An expert on SPV might be able to be more specific, but nevertheless the number of SPV clients vastly outstrips regular node connections, and as the network grows we can expect the SPV demand to increase dis-proportionally to available full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:33:49
Fragmentation is not necessarily a good thing. I'm all for new ideas and systems, but I think its deceptive to claim this is a standard in colored coins when frankly its the new kid on the block. Let it stand on its own merits, but don't paint it as something that it isn't.
There is nothing wrong with focusing your efforts on your own client and software, but it isn't an open source solution, or an open standard. It's a commercial implementation of a new colored coin protocol that addresses perceived limitations in what already exists.
The spec is not reproducible means that given the information you have published it is unreasonable to assume a third party could actually integrate or build anything compatible.  The http protocol actually defines everything to such an extend that it is possible to build a compatible client. Not true for the information you have released thus far.

The defense was pretty bad. They were denied a lot of relevant information though, and certain facts came to light after. I think he can use those to his advantage in an appeal.  Its hard to defend something that is true though and has copious documented evidence that the defendant made himself. Ross took responsibility for running SR after he was convicted, all of the evidence points his way. Coming up with a creative defense to combat the reality isn't easy.

Bitcoin gives you a bunch of capabilities revolving around decentralized trust that many organizations don't care about. If you strip away the tech related to protecting a peer to peer network from other participants you don't trust, the entire technology becomes much simpler and faster. 
I don't think this is the right approach, but I understand it. Share data quickly, know where it came from, keep an immutable record. Three things that banks share in common that they can do without Bitcoin if they trust each other. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:14:09
I like how the conversation is changing. First it was all about remittances, and now its just how digital currency is a small portion of the financial services that can be offered on the block chain. Payments aren't enough to sustain growth yet, companies like Bitpay are similarly having to reach out and peg themselves as larger financial services firms. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:02:21
Right I think we agree on this. I'm just concerned that all things being equal since its not in a nodes economic benefit to support SPV why do it? The benefit is all in the security the node provides to the owner, and supporting SPV is optional. People do it now because its not easy to disable in the standard client, but if it was onerous to continue support  they would simply turn it off. That may benefit the node operator, but doesn't help the overall health of the network, and there isn't an easy way to bring these things into alignment.

@_date: 2015-06-30 14:40:21
There are limitations to Bitcoin's design, and the way the network has organically grown. I don't think it makes sense to hard fork the network continually to add features, which is why side chains, lightening, alt coins, OT, and the other digital cash mechanisms are all going to play a role. The Script language has a lot of capabilities that we have yet to unlock due to relay rules, for example. There are things we can do to increase the load bearing capability of the network as it is though, and that is a very important step in the right direction. There just isn't a one sized fits all solution to scale and application layer logic. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:57:49
In some cases. This prevents old nodes from doing any validation.
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:56:27
Well insofar as startups are gambling then yes. I'd like to think it's more a game of skill than chance. ;) This isn't entirely self interest either, this type of technology is going to help countless people.
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:21:26
This is a major change.  Calling it a soft fork when old nodes can no longer verify transactions seems a bit misleading. Its a big change to the way things are done. Fixing malleability is great. Squeezing more efficiency out is great. Doing so with a fundamental change in the way everything works, not so great.  Building software is hard, now we have even more unproven experimental work to bake into the bitcoin network for a x2 increase. Roughly what we would get by doublng the block size right now, except much more difficult to test and vet across the entire ecosystem.  
@_date: 2015-06-27 01:07:30
Every big company I speak to makes the same mistake. Trying to figure out how to make their own private little versions, which they can fully monetize, instead of connecting to the global network. It's standard think for any  kind of new product, and gives you some insight into why historically established companies jump on trends like the Internet way-late to the game. Ultimately the network effects start to take over, and it's not possible to fight. Every private version is inevitably compared to the global network and falls short because it can't provide the one killer feature of trustless direct-to-consumer payments and tokenization.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:10:57
I'm not arguing the point, I agree with you. What makes Bitcoin interesting is the combination of those technologies in an innovative way to solve digital trust. I think its also brought to light that there are interesting applications that can be built outside of the Bitcoin space using several of those building blocks. A lot of these are being dubbed "blockchain" simply because we don't have any other way of talking about then collectively, but they are technologies that have existed for quite a while.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:51:08
The federal judge spent quite a bit of time saying exactly that. She classified Ross and the organization he built as enablers, partially why he got the sentence he did. It's hard to argue that he made it easier than ever to purchase drugs, weapons, poison, and fake identification.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:13:37
This is a slippery slope though, because except for a very few digital products almost every colored coin has an issuer who by definition must be trusted if the coin ties to anything outside of the blockchain.

It is not identical to a vending machine. Listen, there is a difference between the way we want things to be, and the way they are. I also believe that it should be just like a vending machine legally and otherwise, but it actually falls into several categories.
1) You are executing orders on behalf of a customer, that is called brokerage. 
2) You are taking their funds in order to execute that order, that is custodial.
3) You are possibly in the money transmission / money services businesses to facilitating that transaction.
A flower shop, or Mcdonalds isn't a regulated entity, but a broker sure is. By this reasoning any brokerage is just like mcdonalds, legally this is not true. I wish it was otherwise, but to dance around the issue and paint it as something it isn't is disingenuous. You are rightly trying to leave New York's jurisdiction, but mostly because under the new laws and existing regulation Shapeshift would have to be a regulated entity. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:53:42
We haven't come up with a way to subsidize nodes so its a bit of a moot point. I think this is really a secondary problem, in that the majority of users of the network don't run nodes, and the number of SPV clients is increasing.
So the total utilization of the network goes up, and there isn't a way to incentivize people to support SPV users of the network. If we want to provide security guarantees to those SPV users we need a number of independent nodes to support them and those nodes only get the utility benefit to themselves so they won't scale proportionally to the SPV demand since the number of users who care about that level of security is proportionally small.
So the question is if there is some way to economically stimulate running nodes to support SPV network usage so that it scales more linearly with the total demand for the network.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:49:20
very cool!
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:04:36
It's not really possible, because you would need the market price of each asset... Right now there is no way to do price discovery on most of them, and different protocols are currently being used. Also difficult to tell amount issued vs active.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:56:28
The bandwidth usage is minimal, but it still has to match every transaction in the block with the supplied bloom filter, and build a merkle block which includes the SPV proof. So it has to load the merkle tree into memory, right now I think it loads the block and computes it, I don't think it stores it separately although maybe it caches after load.
So it serves block headers, and then it serves merkleblocks instead of full blocks (which are essentially SPV proof + block header). It trades some complexity on the server for less bandwidth usage for the client.
I'm just saying that there are a lot of clients requesting data, and its not clear how many simultaneous SPV clients a single node can comfortably serve. Those SPV clients just consume resources.

Yeah its not a derivation problem for bip-32, but if you look at the bip-44 spec
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
account' is a hardened address, so you can't share the account master public and derive its children, you can only do private key derivation. You would need to have a non hardened account probably on a separate purpose tree in order to share that master public key and there isn't a bip for that (yet).

Except that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are rapidly being classified as money instruments, really the heart of the bit license. They are money instruments, its hard to classify them otherwise.
So what is really going on is that you are transferring one money instrument, for another money instrument on behalf of a customer who is giving you the funds to do it. If it isn't this way now, you can expect it to be very soon. I'm sure you have spoken to lawyers about it, it sucks but its clearly within the purview of existing regulation. An order routing business for money instruments on behalf of customers is a brokerage. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:27:30
I'm not sure I follow... The miners should get to decide for themselves how many transactions they want to process up to the limits available based on the fee market. Limiting this might decrease load but it is to their detriment... right?
I just think SPV is the load on the network that grows disproportionately to the available full nodes. While its true that if the network doesn't work for them they will stop sending transactions, I would rather the network did work for them and there was a way to economically stimulate people to support that use case. You make the argument that maybe we shouldn't specifically be supporting them, which might be true. Definitely worth some more thought, but we have made concessions already to try and give users security on the network who haven't bought into the idea of running full nodes themselves.
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:37:33
"We don't know who is going to win this race, Ripple or Ethereum."
Neither. Bitcoin has got this one. Codius or a system like it could run on Bitcoin, Counterparty is essentially a smart contract system already, and with some thinking a substantially more clever one could be created. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:39:53
This isn't useful. No one is saying that the Bitcoin network is going to scale to trillions of transactions, but they are saying that a 1 megabyte limit doesn't give us breathing room to investigate other options. Adam unfortunately has way too much economic incentive to limit the expand-ability of the Bitcoin  network in favor of his alt coin solutions, and their corporate funded version of the lightening network. The arguments he presents are straw men based on assumptions of a world wide visa level network, which is not what we are discussing with this block size debate.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:41:05
Bitcoin is already becoming less decentralized as a function of the network growing. Most people don't run nodes, and never will. SPV client and centralized approaches already account for way more users than the few running full nodes. You can't get more centralized than Coinbase, and yet that is the direction we are going because the network can't handle the transaction volume.
Side chain forks are NOT perfectly intertwined with Bitcoin's mining power. That is a dangerously incorrect statement, and the Blockstream guys haven't been up front about it, there is this allusion that there is some kind of equivalency between a sidechain and bitcoin. Transferring value from Bitcoin does not convey security, at all. The side chain runs like an alt coin or some other entirely separate system with its own entirely separate security and rules.
Nobody is saying the block size solves everything by itself, but it is an element of a multi-strategy solution, that ensures the network can sustain greater load in the short term without creating fee price shocks or spamming the network with repeat transactions that never settle. We can't solely rely on Moore's law to bail us out of this, but we can scale proportionally as bandwidth and computing power allows while remaining reasonably decentralized (only 6000 nodes now), while pursuing alternative solutions which takes a while.
@_date: 2015-06-21 18:32:45
This is based on the idea of the available supply decreasing, but its not that straight forward. As the price increases due to restricted supply people who have been hoarding or bought low will be under pressure to sell. There are a lot of Bitcoin being held, and many people will naturally sell as the price increases. So a doubling is not guaranteed by any stretch. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:58:14
Thank you. It's pure snake oil to even pretend that Blockchain tech without Bitcoin is interesting. You can use an existing replicated data store, add digital signatures, and if you trust the participants you have a fast way of conveying information between them. This has literally been around forever. If you trust the participants you have to be insane to use "blockchain" tech, use a database and be done with it. You only have to spend a few minutes with the Hyperledger code base to see that is exactly what it is, it sits on top of Postgresql by default. 
Now is there value in that? Yes, but its absolutely not new, and ignores most of the innovation in Bitcoin because its completely irrelevant to that use case.

@_date: 2015-06-21 21:01:58
All this means is that Chinese miners may not build big blocks, this is their right and will put pressure on the network to keep blocks smaller. Increasing the max blocksize doesn't really change that equation. Their propagation delay may penalize them if other party's of the network can reach consensus before them.
There are more internet users in China than anywhere else, I think we can expect their networks to improve very quickly. There is tremendous pressure to do so.

Sidechains aren't secured by bitcoin. Yes, you can make an asset side chain that functions better, but without 100% merged mining adoption it has the same security characteristics as an altcoin.

They don't. The point I'm making is that this isn't a stand against the Bitlicense, its that their model is incompatible with it.

No, they can introduce new evidence.

It depends on what kind of accuracy you are trying to achieve, I imagine that you need to keep block data around for reorganizations which might affect the mempool. I'm not sure how Toshi stores that. 
A single small node on digital ocean can host a single instance of bitcoind, which is probably all you need to pull most of the relevant mempool info.

Why does that matter? It's called an internal market, and every money exchange in the world runs one. Whether they sell now, or sell later is not relevant. The fact is the money is given to them, then they execute a trade immediately on their internal market, then they deliver you coins, and then they put your coins to market at some point when it is feasible. That is called brokerage. I wish it wasn't like that and they could slip between the cracks, but pretending it is otherwise doesn't make it so.

We will have to agree to disagree. I think a case can be made that once someone is an addict they are by definition no longer in a position to make the right choices regarding their own well being, and also inevitably affect the people around them in their communities, and families. Your  response makes me feel like you've never known a heroin addict. The drugs subvert the rational decision making process.
Also, your statements just aren't factual. There were several children (those under the age of majority) who took drugs and died from the use of them and procured them from Silk Road. Were they mature adults capable of making rational decisions?
I realize arguing on reddit about this is useless. Everyone believes all drugs should be completely free, and everyone should have perfect self determination and control, except no functioning society actually works that way.

This was so obviously going to happen. You have a commercial company that releases a new "standard" that is just their new commercial implementation. Telling that anyone who actually has written a colored coin platform except Colu is no longer on the board of directors for this website.
I don't like the fact that they call it "The New Colored Coins" everywhere when in fact its just Colu Assets, its not a standard, its just one of many colored coin variants, and its not sitting on coloredcoins.org because everyone agreed this was the way forward.
Also, the open source code is entirely reliant on their backend. What is the point? All of the meta data storage is reliant on their backend, all of the functionality requires their backend. This new definition of open source where a shim is fully open but everything else is locked up doesn't make any sense. It might pacify the community, but it's just not open. 
I'm extremely biased. I've written a color coin platform, which puts me in a good position to talk about the entire ecosystem. The specification is extremely difficult to follow, with few examples or test vectors. There are two other competing standards that actually have users and traction, Open Assets (Coinprism) which my enterprise platform is based on (Ember Financial), and Chromaway which uses EPOBC.
Finally, the spec as it stands is not reproducible. There just isn't any way to build a real open source or inter-operable version without a ton of reverse engineering. Thats not how you build concensus and open standards, and one of the reasons you see so many different firms picking up Open Assets as their preferred system.

How does this eliminate the most wide spread fraud specifically? I'm not disputing, but I'm not sure about which part of the service you are talking about. For pure digital delivery I get it, although since its a closed ecosystem anyway using the blockchain isn't particularly interesting. For physical purchase its much less clear how this interacts with traditional fraud in that space. Since you seem to be the local expert, please fill us in.
I understand the limitations are by design. I'm just talking about practical use right now.

The blockchain is really just the immutable record store. Sql databases are usually entirely mutable, although you could front them with a bunch of procedures to prevent that from happening. The point is that once you add trust back in there are a million applicable technologies and ways to design the system. The underlying doesn't matter much. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:42:54
I would be surprised if this platform let you transfer anything off of it. Its essentially a database, it issues some colored coins, and it keeps the keys inside, all the ownership rules and regulations are handled by the ATS. It makes for good publicity but this isn't what any of us think of when we think of an exchange, which is probably part of the reason the original team bailed.

Its called an Acquire hire... this wasn't some major cash out. I think Hyperledger failed to secure additional funding.
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:59:22
This is a good question. I think it mostly revolves around the control not being centralized. So everyone trusts everyone else so you don't have to worry about sybil attacks etc, but then the ledger entries are written modified with signatures generated by private keys held in respective organizations. So its really just a timestamped digital signature tech for sharing data.  You can check out the hyperledger source code its pretty simple, there are about 5 lines of crypto in the whole thing.
So its like a replicated sql database except changes are propagated based on digital signatures originating on the different nodes. That's my two minute analysis.

I did read it. 62% of theft is actually done by employees of the places selling the gift cards. Most gift card are not activated except at the register which cuts out much of the consumer theft. If an employee activates a card using a scanner and resells it or uses it, this doesn't prevent that. It may provide more auditing, but that would require integration with the POS that does the retail activation, and presumably they can audit that already internally.
I am a huge advocate of digital property and ownership, I've built a platform that could be used to do exactly this in the gift card space, but whenever I've approached the custodial rules around this it didn't seem worth the extra complexity. If I'm wrong thats great for me, more potential customers.

This architecture centralizes transactions through 21 as the service provider. We should be empowering truly decentralized applications.
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:41:48
Maybe. Erik is a US citizen as far as I know, founding a company in Switzerland or anywhere else does not allow him to avoid us courts in all circumstances.
I wish the regulation was different, but its pretty clear that this is at least a money exchange service, that they do deal with customer funds (no matter how briefly) and that they trade those funds in order to do the exchange. He is on record that digital currency is money, there is really no denying the nature of this business.
Further, conceptually I really don't like it. It's the very definition of being a middleman and exists only because the exchanges themselves are incompatible. I like decentralized solutions that cut out middlemen, taking a cut of swaps in currency is the oldest banking game in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:23:51
I think so. If you look at Factom its like one step away from being Git+API+hashing to existing blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:08:22
Maybe, but they are probably saddled with lots of technical debt. Its hard to work through technical debt and roll out better solutions, it costs time and money, and you have to be careful about user growth. The scale of the problem isn't trivial, check out their wallet growth numbers, 
So design decisions they made very early are very likely to blame for some of the instability they have had. I'm not forgiving down time, I don't believe it should ever happen, but having worked on enough large scale systems that have grown organically I have a first hand appreciation for just how difficult it is to tackle issues years after choices have been made.
On second look the all time graph is even better,  
it shows that code put in place 2 years ago, may not have been scalable enough to handle the massive growth they have had.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:54:34
Again not relevant. The regulation and law concerning this is pretty clear. It doesn't matter if they pay you out of funds they hold or not, they accept you funds first before they pay you. If shape shift starts giving out coins before you send them your own then maybe it would be non custodial.

Why was it not immoral? If someone is addicted to drugs, is it a  moral act to let them destroy themselves? There is a difference between allowing self determination and general morality. If someone is trying to kill someone else, is it a moral act to sell them cyanide?  Is it moral to sell kilos of cocaine to third party distributors which will then go on to fuel drug related violence in some of the poorest communities in the US and abroad? 
I think there are two very distinct issues here. Whether drugs should be legal (Yes, with caveats) and whether Ross operated in a way that mitigated harm to the users of the silk road. There is ample evidence that he did not, the site practiced almost no risk mitigation whatsoever, and was designed to expand the market without regard for the consequences to the users or anyone else. These types of actions have effects beyond the end user, its tunnel vision to think otherwise.

Well, liquor and tobacco are regulated to an extent, we have id laws in place and ordinances against their use in public, around schools etc. I'm not saying that the drug policies haven't failed in many ways, but the solution is to attack those policies not run a criminal conspiracy.

It isn't the same equation. I'm not saying someone forced them to do drugs, I'm saying that once they are addicted the rational decision making process is suspended. Silk road made it easy for these people to feed their addiction in the privacy and comfort of their own homes, i.e outside of the system and in a way that is impossible to monitor. You can't get help to people who are outside the system. Some would argue that isn't our responsibility, except there are plenty of examples where we extend help to those who are in a bad situation, because we have learned from history that it is in our mutual interest as a society to have functioning members of it if possible.

What mitigation methods? A drug dealer deciding to not sell something is not called a site specific mitigation method. That happens in the real world too. The quack doctor they had was not a mitigation method, and people in a forum describing how to do drugs is not necessarily a mitigation method. Besides these forums and information sources have existed long before the silk road, their inclusion of communication between users is not some kind of novel method of drug safety.
I'm saying there is a line between choice, and when rational choice is suspended after using hard drugs. You can disagree but the facts speak differently.

I am not sure why you guys persist in saying that sidechains are not alt coins. When if they are not Bitcoin what exactly are they? Moving value from one chain to another does not give another coin the same security or functionality or guarantees as Bitcoin. Period. So it conveys value without security, but for other functionality. This is a whole different discussion and not germane to the blockchain debate except that it colors the motivations of some of the players involved with respect to block size. This is further colored by your work on Lightening, again not germane except that sometime in the next year there may be another method to scale, fantastic. Strawpay already exists, is it substantially flawed? Seems like we could get behind it right now if it works. Really, I'm not here to debate the relative merits of Blockstream's solutions.
We can agree on the following:
Increasing the block size does not increase the size of blocks. Unless Miners decide to build bigger blocks, and they simply may not for network propagation reasons and the incentives that they run under. This doesn't change that equation. Blocks take longer to propagate, thus people may not risk filling bigger blocks, especially miners with bandwidth and latency constraints to the rest of the network.
Cranking the size does not increase scaleability. I think we agree, it does kick the can, it doesn't categorically change the network. As Adam said this is not something that is easily simply fixed due to the algorithmic complexity of the network. However, it does allow the network to handle greater load than it could otherwise handle per your own admission.
The number of bitcoin nodes has decreased. Why? Well, SPV plays a major role, as do web based wallets, and centralized services. Most people don't run SMTP servers. Most people don't run full BGP routing tables. The internet does a pretty good job of being decentralized. If there is any centralization in Bitcoin it really happens at the miner level right now, the block size debate does not change this. A lot of people don't run nodes at 1 megabyte because they don't want to host the blockchain. Period. It makes for a bad user experience vs the alternatives. Maybe pruning will help reverse this trend as old blocks are discarded from disk, but the fact remains there is little to no economic incentive to run a node. For a system based on incentives this is a problem. If people care about security first and foremost, then they will. Otherwise, they probably won't. The vast majority of users do not engage in autonomous verification, one way or another.
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about giving us room on that exponential growth curve that we expect to happen if things work out in Bitcoin. That's it. There aren't any alternative proposals that address this and are ready right now.
I think transactions taking an inordinate amount of time to confirm is a real problem. I think continual rebroadcasts of large number of transactions flooding the p2p network is a real problem. I think rapid fee growth is a real problem for adoption. I worry that this may happen sooner than we expect, and that rather than being caught with our pants down we have something, anything in place that may mitigate the affects. We can't look to history in the regard, except to remember that the Bitcoin client didn't start out with a 1 megabyte limit, and it won't end with one. Commercial utilization of the blockchain, and consumer adoptions are happening at the same time. Billions of dollars are potentially being pumped into blockchain solutions. All of these are going to compete for usage of the network.
A lot has to change to really improve scale, reduce upload bandwidth, we need to be much smarter about block and transaction relay, and possibly incorporate other off chain solutions for the vast majority of clients. Pruning + smarter relay will reduce the costs to run a node even at 20 megabytes, but they take time to implement like anything else.
The trend has been to centralized services like Coinbase for a long time, ironically the long term affects of not being able to use the network directly is the ultimate in centralization and driving new consumers into those solutions instead of SPV which will rapidly cost too much and take too long to be useful to them directly. The ideological debate about centralization as the reason not to increase the block size is just flawed, the net affect of such a low tps rate is  centralization for users that have no economic incentive to run nodes. The ideological thinking is not aligned with the reality. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:37:16
I think sidechains are a bit overrated... I'm not saying they don't have value, but a completely independent coin running on a different codebase than Bitcoin would be far more valuable. Differentiation technically and otherwise is important. Linking everything together may destabilize Bitcoin in unexpected ways. I wrote about this on my blog here, 
A two way peg may lead to some interesting innovation, but it is all predicated on digital scarcity being good for transaction infrastructure. Certainly nothing points to that being true. Would HTTP be a popular protocol if every request required a micro-payment? Maybe a terrible example, but bringing it into finance who wants to issue contracts and have them transferred around in a depreciating and non-fungible asset? I'm not a huge fan of ripple but they got this right, XRP is better structured for transaction infrastructure.

The decentralized lotto will happen, its just too easy for it not to be one of the first apps out there. Its a race to the bottom though because there is no cost to make an app that does the lotto without any take just based on a percentage of total sales.

This  is the main issue with the alternative implementations. You can write as many unit tests as you want, but if Bitcoind has a bug and genuine faulty functionality it still wins by consensus and you will start orphaning blocks. A lot of the earlier implementations suffered repeatedly from this, and it remains to be seen how btcd and bitcoinj will do. That being said they are both really high quality comparatively.

This is cool, but this and honestly every single project including Chain.com just throws everything into a big Postgresql database. Very little effort seems to have gone into figuring out new ways of facilitating building block chain applications, and most of these places are approaching the problem like typical web dev instead of as a financial grade application.

Yeah I second this. The ability to put the qr on every ticket and have instant payment and redemption would be incredible. Actually Bitcoin takes it a step further because you could either immediately pay off the ticket or send  a minimum payment to another code that would dispute it. Both would save the city a lot of time and money if they got any acceptance. Very cool.

Yeah, there can't really be a free floating "sidechain", in that the definition of a side chain is that it has converted value from Bitcoin's main chain.

I think we need to let some real accountants weigh in, and realize that if we do need to do more sophisticated accounting that we have probably the best tools ever developed to do so. I think most of the reaction is based on the idea that there is a ruling at all, but guidance on these things is critically important for businesses to start accepting Bitcoin in a major way.

Oh I didn't realize that is how it worked. I assumed that an address was generated, and you sent whatever there. Of course given that this is denominated in Fiat, it makes sense that it is generated after the fact. Still, they should never send out an email if no transaction occurs.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:55:19
What we need is a few of the smaller countries to band together and switch to Bitcoin wholesale. Unlikely we will see even the small ones willing to give up a fiat monetary policy though, too much power for the central bank and government.

I don't think people are spreading fud, this code is genuinely tricky stuff. Bitcoin is difficult to understand end-to-end. I'm not sure how many people on the planet  know the ins and outs of the protocols involved. Again, I do want to see alternative implementations, and I encourage people to run them,  but switching over wholesale to something else even if that was possible would be very risky. Due to the nature of the consensus any transition could be a long time coming. I built the first version of Coinlock on an alternate implementation and due to bugs in Bitcoind that turned out to be the wrong move at the time. It may suck but its just the reality of these types of distributed systems, especially ones with so much riding on them.
@_date: 2014-08-10 03:31:43
This is really cool, but it should be built right into Bitcoin.  That being said we get back into the same issue  of authenticated identity. Nothing is really stopping me from registering someone elses identity is there?  Seems like OAuth against a known provider might help... but still doesn't really do it. I think Keybase.io might have the right approach here, which is using federated identity over a large  number of accounts to have the semblance of verified identity.

No, if the conversion rate is fixed then the price will always gravitate towards the lower value. If it costs me 2 bitcoins to buy 20 sidecoins on a free market, but 1 bitcoin to buy 20 if I do a chain-to-chain conversion, then the price will converge to 1. If I can sell it on the free market at 1/2 a bitcoin but I can convert it to 1 on a chain-to-chain conversion then the sell price gravitates to 1.
Why would I ever buy 20 sidecoins for more than 1 bitcoin if I can always buy at 1? Why would I ever sell 20 sidecoins for less than 1 bitcoin is I can always sell at 1?
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:32:02
I don't think there is enough information to wildly speculate about the reasons for this. Organizations of different sizes and at different stages have different needs. There have been some recent scale issues, and some security problems, they should be using some of their windfall to  hire a very well rounded and seasoned team. Failure to do so will see them lose significant ground  to the competition as their core services are commoditized. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:30:56
They are altcoins. I don't know why you keep insisting that they aren't. Using the same coin supply != Bitcoin.
If I transfer 1 bitcoin to a side chain which has 1/2 the proof of work, and has a dodgy code base is it equal to Bitcoin? That is the financial statement you are making when you move value. It just isn't true. You are actually absorbing the risk of the side chain at a non market rate. This is something that people just don't seem to understand, its a critical differentiation. 
There is also a penalty to move coins, it is a slower process to convert Bitcoin to a Side chain, then do the transaction, then to just facilitate it on Bitcoin itself.


Good. Lets put it another way, if a side chain gets developed that is way better than Bitcoin, what will happen to the Bitcoin?
I don't think Bitcoin needs to incorporate every new feature in order to maintain market share, I think it already has reached the critical mass necessary to carry it forward. Look at ACH, the protocol is shit, but its still the dominant payments technology. Something would have to come along  that is so much better that it completely destroys the hundred million dollar incentive that runs the network.
I oppose it on the grounds that there hasn't been a strong open discussion about the fundamental economics of side chains versus the alt coin ecosystem. I think economically it doesn't make sense, it twists the incentive structure of building coins to begin with, and hides information from the market about the relative value of the side chains which are not equivalent to Bitcoin. You have stated multiple times that they are equivalent, but that is fundamentally untrue in every possible way, a fact that is simply obscured when you have deterministic pegging. I also think that the option leaves open questions about migrating Bitcoin entirely into regulated and corporate silos.

Yeah, so this is very cool and is possible to build,  but we already have a distributed keypair infrastructure with a general ledger for accountability, auditing and that supports multi-party transactions, it's called the blockchain. So digitally how do we ensure that each person only votes once? That they can retain anonymity in the voting process? I think it has to do with a supplemental signature that signs the vote... I've already written alot of this up just haven't posted, maybe I should do that. :)
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:59:51
I'm not sure how this would work, I imagine that units have to stay the same in order for a two way peg to work. So an alt-coin couldn't deliver more or less BTC back then it had, but that rate would fluctuate against the coin. I like the general idea though, I hope someone much smarter than me figures out how to make that happen.

You haven't "called me out" on anything. I have said numerous times that I don't think the space will fragment the way you imply, and that side chain fragmentation is a guarantee of a "Seperate but equal" bitcoin that does not have the same inclusivity and financial freedom for all that the bitcoin network currently enjoys.
To me its evident that you have priorities that are not in line with the continuing freedom of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and don't want me to express an opinion that might make people think twice about what they are being offered on a silver platter. Beware of strangers bearing gifts.

This is cool, but its a really simple operation. The private key component of the key pair is a 32 byte binary. You could trivially split that into 8 32bit integers, or 4 64bit integers.

I don't think you can do this with normal bitcoind, you basically need to connect to as many nodes as possible and not announce that you know about any transactions so that every node relays to you. You could then guess when a transaction is over 50% of the network based on the complete node list.  If this is sponsored by the bitcoin foundation shouldn't they be releasing their code?

So with respect to uncoloring is this  true? If I take a counterparty asset and send it to bitcoind, and then send it back into counterparty doesnt the tracking stop and the whole thing break? I think that there are safeguards meant to stop this from happening built into the client, but conceptually is has the same problem as colored coin. Colored coin can't get uncolored on receive, only on spend. 
Its exciting stuff for sure, I want to best solution to win, but either way there are a lot of possibilities in the space.

There is a definite hoarding mentality in BTC. It may affect its long term viability, which could depress the price. I think it is one of the fundamental challenges facing Bitcoin right now, because it makes it a less fungible unit of exchange. That hampers adoption by merchants and service providers, and there is a reinforcing negative spiral to the whole thing. I think if we want BTC to succeed, we need to be willing to spend it.

I don't understand the economic incentive either. I think someone needs to write up the 51% attack not from a technical perspective, but how it makes sense economically for someone who controls that much of the network. It seems to me that a verified attack by the largest pool would tank the price of Bitcoin, which is what their profits are denominated in. Maybe taking a speculative bet that they could sell high, buy low and capture a rebound on dissolution. Realistically it just seems like killing the golden goose, these guys  are raking it in, why shake up the status quo?  On the other end of the spectrum it seems to me that they should cap their network at 49%, but there is a perverse incentive to take over as much of the network as possible.
I think these guys are going to act in rational self interest, unless the economics of the situation make an attack actually worth it I don't think we have much to fear. We should be working as a community to diminish the possibility, but it isn't time to pack up and go home.

I think that there are different definitions of micro transactions and that muddies the water. There are people in the advertising space that want to charge per view and that is a fractional penny. Obviously the way BTC works now that doesn't happen without an intermediary holding the payments and deducting. Kind of like changetip but for  micro payments. I can also think of some other more clever ways to do this that would drive down the effective cost.
A broader definition might be for anything under a dollar. Fees for such small transactions would be about 5%-6%, not ideal but not terrible either. 
Whats the compelling business case for sub penny digital currency transactions? I could build it, but I don't know where it would be integrated and it would require client integration work.

This just isn't true. Counterparty suffers from the kitchen sink mentality. They are trying to build everything into the protocol, tons of functionality. It has decentralized exchange which is cool, but the centralized exchanges aren't going anywhere. Why is that? Its because they are better at it, purpose built for one thing. Colored coins is a better basis to build next generation systems because it provides the key ingredients, should ultimately support SPV and does atomic swap in a single transaction. I love what counterparty has done, but obsesses over it when its not the best solution for everything.

Bitcoin is right on the cusp of something big. A lot of smart and dedicated people are building companies in the space, and trying to come up with clever ways to drive consumer adoption.

There are a lot of smart people trying to solve this in different ways. It is a major barrier for adoption for certain segments of the market that want to charge people on a recurring basis. A lot of businesses make most of their revenue in a recurring fashion. Bitcoin as it is structured doesn't support this directly, but it would be possible to augment the clients so that they could pay directly based on a schedule submitted by the merchant. I think there are open proposals for this out there now.

I'm not sure what the problem is. Is he supposed to hire people with less experience?  There may indeed be a conflict of interest, but that is all predicated on whether Sidechains are good for Bitcoin or not. Certainly they are no worse than Altcoins, and still haven't solved the issues around incentivizing miners. Nobody is interested in messing up the Bitcoin network, so any changes are probably going to be quite gradual. 
Also there are alternative implementations and other ways of interfacing with the network. I don't think sidechains are particularly compelling vs colored coins, except that it may lead to a much more scalable system in the long term. There are other ways to address scale without moving value between chains.

There is no technical limit on Bitcoin donations, just to be clear. Also the payment didn't bounce, the money definitely got to Bitpay, did they just send it back to the sending address?
There really isn't any reason to insert Bitpay into this transaction, its just easier but at the cost of exposing yourself to these types of problems. Its a little more work but most of these organizations are used to doing some accounting, handling the sell to USD isn't rocket science.

Running Bitcoin nodes on Azure, EC2 or really any cloud provider isn't terribly cost effective.

I agree. Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket right now. Most people don't even know what it is, and the traditional payments industry sees it on the far edge of the radar. Bitcoin has traditionally not been well suited to building software on top of it, the interfaces were clunky, the official client not very good for transactional architecture.
This is changing though. A lot of companies are starting to build libraries, api services, and other third party utilities that should make it easier to build commercial software on top of the Bitcoin network. I think we haven't seen the breakout successes yet, but they are coming. It takes a lot of effort to build something new and unique that really pushes us all forward with respect to business or consumer adoption.

You know that remotely listening in on mobile phones has been demonstrated, as well as converting subtle vibration to sound.

This is how the network works, you are describing the unspent output pool, except with fixed outputs because there are no change addresses. The problem is concensus, the reason you retain blocks over time is to achieve consensus in the decentralized network. What if nodes 1-10 say that a key has been spent, and nodes 11-20 say it hasn't? I think the problem with this scheme you propose is that it ignores the purpose of proof of work and the blockchain's role in consensus in a decentralized network.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:41:14
Yeah. I've read both submissions, and I'm not quite sure what this is. I think it needs a good elevator pitch. :)  If I understand correctly its a set of shared communication services that are powered by micro transactions? I'm confused why that model will work while other more distributed attempts at social networking have largely failed that were free. I think there is a market for applications built around Bitcoin/Namecoin as a kind of service bus, but not sure where this fits in.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:59:25
I think the issue is that the blockchain is already very slow. So decentralized exchange is a nice feature, but expecting it to supplant the existing exchange infrastructure which is extremely scale-able, low latency, and proven is wishful thinking. Colored coin will slide slide right into what we already have very nicely. The transaction throughput of the blockchain is absolutely tiny compared with normal trade throughput on any given exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:19:04
Why do you say that? Blockchain is not Bitcoin. There are hundreds of companies trying to figure it out, tens of millions in venture capital this year alone, and more service offerings than ever. I do agree that the first generation companies are going to struggle because consumer interest seems to be waning as its being presented.

The argument that you have to trust the issuer is correct in almost all circumstances. That being said, it is the blockchain. If an asset is only supposed to have 1 occurrence and then suddenly another appears, that invalidates the trust in the asset. Let the market decide at that point what it is worth. The reality is that both coloring technologies will continue to live on, I'm just expressing an opinion that I believe open assets to be superior in most respects.

I explained it above, but insofar as I understand it there is only one thing you can't do with Bitcoin that you can do theoretically with Ethereum, which is run autonomous smart contracts. In other words the code is hosted in the blockchain itself. I don't think that functionality is particularly interesting or innovative, and I would much rather see a well design agent infrastructure built on the incredibly secure and large trust network we already have, Bitcoin.

It absolutely is their fault.
The product should be designed with better two factor authentication as standard, and the data should be encrypted per account or device. Similar to how they handle imessage. Not to mention the brute forcing attack that was possibly exploited. They have the technology they just haven't done a very good job integrating it end-to-end.
I can't speak about their credit card systems, who knows how much of that is internal vs outsourced.

Its too volatile for poor people. Seriously, in its current state using Bitcoin-proper for the poor is a terrible idea. In the long term though there are about a billion people who don't have access to traditional banking. Once we start integrating these people into the system things will change dramatically for everyone. There is too much friction in the market to absorb the results of their labor, which depresses entire regions.

Well I think that changes to Bitcoin core should be considered in both their technical and economic context. The system's success is largely due to these carefully tuned incentives, miner block incentives, transaction fees, etc. As well as speculation as to the increasing utility of the network. When we introduce features that could alter that incentive structure, or create a mechanism to migrate out of Bitcoin into another chain, we need to very carefully consider what that means.
If it continues to grow there will be increased regulation, and there will be external forces trying to exert influence. I worry that we may be inadvertently creating a backdoor into the eco-system via the two way peg that doesn't serve the economic interests of the network.
I'm not sure how to prevent corporate interests from inserting themselves into Bitcoin. To a certain extent that is already happening by virtue of the fact that core developers need to make money also. If all of them had ridden  the bitcoin train to billions that wouldn't be the case and financial motivation and pressure would be decreased. I think all I can advocate is vigilance, and an open dialogue with these companies that isn't completely  dominated by fud. Lets discuss things on both technical and economic merits since we are dealing with a system that is a hybrid of both.

This was a really interesting but doing everything on the block chain doesn't make a lot of sense. They keep saying that HFT transaction rates are possible... extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
So trust-less systems are interesting, but they aren't generally very fast.
The risk to changing Bitcoin is huge, which means it is a long time until side chains are being used. I also don't think there is an issue with trading BTC for any alt coin using a centralized exchange model. We just haven't seen the regulated exchanges adopt btc yet. 
It seems to me that these guys have built some compelling technology, but I actually think it would make more sense to launch it as an alt. Something they specifically don't want to do. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:57:51
Decentralized exchange is slow and inefficient. Its a neat idea, and I'm glad someone is doing it, but exchange-based trading isn't going anywhere.

I think it remains to be seen whether their model is even plausible. It sounds great in theory, but the devil is in the details. Very difficult to implement as originally presented, non trivial is an understatement.  I'm starting to wonder if there is a simpler way to do distributed computation that uses the network for cost-routing but doesn't bake more intelligence into the network itself.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:09:36
Sure, there are lots of companies that will "lock" value, but they all add a spread since all they are doing is trading out bitcoin on your behalf and taking the difference. Something that doesn't seem like a good value proposition to me. They also centralize the risk in their respective institutions. I think its a good solution for what it is, but its not how we get the world's poor using Bitcoin.

No definitely not, but I was originally responding to the idea that Japan was light years ahead of the US, and like most things it is a bit more nuanced than that. In certain areas they are ahead, and in others they are behind. In financial services, they are generally behind, but in industries that benefit from their small geography and high population density like mobile networks they are very much ahead.

Yeah I get it, but now instead of managing 1 or two databases you have a ton of them. All operating and being managed independently. This implies there isn't shared state, but any complicated application is going to need that also. Again, I never said this doesn't work, it just doesn't strike me as particularly elegant or interesting, and adds nothing to the ecosystem with respect to actually building block chain applications. Take blockchain, throw in database has been done about 20 times already. That is my personal opinion.

Nanex is a joke. These guys have almost zero insight into anything. Whenever someone brings them up I know they have never been involved in trading. Their analysis of the flash crash which rocketed them into the public eye was incredibly flawed. The markets that they do analysis on are completely opaque, and they frequently conflate convergent behavior as the intent of single operators. That means they are seeing streams of quotes that they cannot possibly correlate except based on time, which is completely useless. Modern markets are not so easily analyzed, and they have preyed on peoples fear of HFT operators in their marketing and literature in order to shamelessly self promote. As I said, if you want evidence go look at the historical spreads, calculate how much it cost to buy a single equity through an established broker and compare and contrast to today. The cost difference isn't due to electronic markets, those existed in the 90s. HFT is the most vilified modern invention despite the fact that on average is saves normal people outrageous amounts of money in aggregate.

Bitcoin doesn't really address this. Yes, you can send payment anonymously, but organizations still need to comply with US Law if they don't want their funds to be seized or their businesses shut down. Anti money laundering and know your customer compliance are part of that process, and regardless of the payment mechanism used will remain.
A certain percentage of the gambling sites will go underground, but most legitimate businesses are going to continue to comply with regulations in place to preserve their revenue stream.

A lot of comments about how people who didn't donate shouldn't voice their opinion on this. The same thing has happened too many times in the Bitcoin community because people who knew better didn't say anything, or weren't vocal enough. This project doesn't pass the smell test, it just doesn't. For a million up front you could probably just acquire a commercial forum software, and open source it. Its just one of those problems that people right out of school have been working on for twenty years, there is a ton of stuff lying around, and another crap implementation isn't what the world needs.

So just to verify, internally they are using the uncompressed key to generate the address? It seems like this would result in two different addresses which would classify this as a fairly serious bug.
That being said you can't lose money. If you have the compresssed or uncompressed keypair you should be able to generate the other one and have control of both addresses. So you can import both a compressed and uncompressed WIF and recover any funds sent to either address.  I'm surprised they haven't standardized on compressed across the board, as a poster above mentions it just saves money.

I think that in certain instances not doing real time trading might make sense, but for the most part you want information to travel throughout the entire system as quickly as possible. The existing financial system gets a lot of flack but it is very efficient at conveying information because there is a strong monetary incentive to build and support the systems and networks that do that in the form of price/time arbitrage. I think we should be focusing on Bitcoin's core strengths, and realize that exchange systems in countries world wide are a necessary component of really expanding where and how Bitcoin can be used.
I think the moment you want to facilitate a trade you hand over control. The total amount you can trade is a function of how much control you have handed over. I don't think there is an easy way around that, very little incentive to sign off on a trade that went the wrong way.

This definitely isn't a blockchain.info specific problem, there is a larger issue with key storage, safety and usability in the Bitcoin space.

I think its a great service. People tend to think the issue with remittances is the transfer speed between countries but the hurdle is often the last mile. A system like Xoom does country to country transfer instantly also without paying the exchange spread on both ends. The US is stuck with a very antiquated transfer system, part of the problem with being first on the block to have automated payments. Best of luck with it, the instant transfers are very cool.

How can that be true? If the sidechains are denominated in Bitcoin which is what locking does, then they aren't independent. What happens to Bitcoin that get moved to a sidechain and never return, or the sidechain itself collapses in some way? It seems to me that the sidechain rate is exactly equivalent to Bitcoin, whereas in an altcoin we have free floating prices over time based on the value of the chain. Is this not the case?

It is possible, but it isn't seamless. Unless a micro payment channel is built into the browser I doubt it would work. There was software released many years ago that did this and failed spectacularly because there just wasn't the  necessary consumer adoption.

People have the option to use pegged assets now. I can start an alt coin, peg it to Bitcoin and try and sell it and buy it at a fixed rate, but the market price will quickly collapse since a peg is unsustainable. Side chains force a peg that doesn't equate in any way to reality.
That is a straw man argument, and completely false. Considering that I've bet the farm on bitcoin, denounced alt coins frequently, and have a record of being a very strong bitcoin proponent, any accusation to the contrary is completely baseless. How about you attack my core arguments as to why side chains are a bad idea, instead of trying to paint me as somehow wanting the destruction of Bitcoin?
I think its far more likely that you are biased towards side chains for financial or other gain, given that at every opportunity you troll people who don't think its the panacea you make it out to be.


You want Bitcoin to adopt side chains because you want to be able to have a chance of displacing Bitcoin with a closed or commercial system. Its easy making baseless accusations isn't it?

I think associating Bitcoin with UFC isn't a good idea. It is a coin toss as to whether the public will perceive that positively or negatively. There are some people who have problems with UFC in general, and others who already see Bitcoin as something used by an underground economy and not for them. I think as a community we need to combat those assumptions, by creating positive awareness around the transformative capabilities of digital currency.
I proposed this on twitter, but I think a far more meaningful and useful way to do this would be to advertise a QRCode on the side of the ring, during intermission, or from both fighters that digital currency donations can be sent to and all proceeds go to muscular dystrophy or some other worthy cause.  Good press, good cause, meaningful exposure without taking sides or associating Bitcoin with either the fighting or potentially the loser. Its a neutral position that anyone can get behind, and it helps get the word out. I think even an explanation that a QRcode can be snapped on the screen and payment instantly made will get some really positive attention.

No corporate entity wants to give that up.

I am thinking practically. Bitcoin is a grain of sand in an economic system that dwarfs it by many orders of magnitude. The existing power structures will not simply roll over in the face of technological change, to believe otherwise is exceedingly naive. Saying that there is nothing to learn from the way things have been done is like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Some smart people built the current systems, there is nothing wrong about learning from them and embracing them as necessary. If you don't have expertise in how they work, perhaps you aren't a good judge of their efficacy. Maybe if people with real experience had jumped in earlier we wouldn't have ended up with this mt. gox mess.

Yes its absolutely possible. Its called fork Bitcoin (alt coin) and get all of the miners to merge mine it, then trade it freely like any other coin :) Basically the same situation a side chain has to be in to be valuable to begin with, if it didn't artificially peg to Bitcoin. Thats why I think for scale reasons it is very interesting, but the other use cases are tenuous at best. There is a lot of hand waving about what it actually accomplishes that is desirable and makes strong economic sense that Bitcoin doesn't already do, or couldn't be represented in a decentralized and distributed alt coin ecosystem.

I think a constructive way to approach guidelines would be to map the % of reorgs by the chain depth. Then say, your transaction has a 0.5% chance of being rolled back at 1 block, a 1% at 2 blocks, etc. People and businesses have different risk tolerances that might be more adequately addressed that way then putting dollar amounts in there, and are willing to  swap time for assurances depending on that tolerance.

I disagree. It actually is tremendously flexible, and allows for the implementation of a wide variety of voting systems because you can enforce rules after the fact during the tallying process.  Anonymity might be an issue, I think its still possible though,  a new address is essentially anonymous if it isn't in a shared wallet. But a mechanism needs to be developed so that bad actors can't pollute the system, and I think that has to be through a separate identity service or registry. Maybe it is as simple as dispersing a voting token once per unique identity and not recording who go the token, which is pretty much how voting works here in the US at the polls anyway.

I do think that the economic and technical ramifications of 2 way pegging have not been thought out by the community at large. The market incentives don't make much sense, and it opens a migration path away from Bitcoin into other company controlled alternatives.

I don't think side chains are particularly innovative. I think they add risk, and provide little economic benefit. There is very little difference between a side chain and an alt coin, except that an alt coin's price can fluctuate based on its relative merits and a side chain cannot. You are conflating Bitcoin with a side chain, they are not the same, they just have a statement of value that denotes equality that isn't there. You can already experiment to your hearts content with crypto innovation, its called an alt coin. Side chains don't magically get the security of Bitcoin, which means they should trade at a substantial discount. Except that isn't set by market forces. 
I'm also not advocating for not changing the protocol, but this particular change could have ramifications that haven't been thought out, and is largely unnecessary except as a scalability measure. Considering we haven't done the obvious stuff first this seems like we are jumping the gun. No one has really explained concretely why it makes any sense to risk Bitcoin directly in a side chain rather than just purchasing an alt coin. If a side chain conveyed the benefits of Bitcoin that might make sense, but since it operated identically to an alt coin, it means you are buying something with neither risk nor reward that isn't accurately priced based on its technical and economic merits.

The problem is that when you point at data from Nanex, it doesn't mean anything. There isn't a single person actually in trading who takes them seriously. That isn't an ad hominem. If you don't understand the type of data they are basing their analysis off of you can't make an informed decision about the validity of their analysis. This is a link to an article about trading, from data about costs to investors as collected by Elkins/Mcsherry. Those guys have data as early as 1991, and do historical analysis of the impact that HFT and other players have on spread prices. 
The net affect is extraordinary amounts of liquidity and downward execution price pressure. There are many articles from various sources that come to the same conclusion. The idea that HFT is harming everyday investors couldn't be more false.

Except that Bitcoin can leave the main chain, and never come back. Similar to a burn, except not on purpose.


No they don't. They are alt coins. They alleviate no such risk, there can still be dozens of chains that are not innovative and are mere forks. In fact they encourage the creation of multiple blockchains that essentially steal value from Bitcoin's main chain at non market rates.


It doesn't incorporate any new features. The side chains are not bitcoin. They don't add anything to Bitcoin's main chain. Its exactly the role of an alt coin right now. Side chain is a clever name because it implies some kind of connection with Bitcoin when there isn't except with deterministic transfer of value. Which is essentially theft since the free market doesn't decide what that value is.


I think encouraging Bitcoin to live on multiple chains increases fragmentation of the Bitcoin chain, as multiple ones become necessary for its operation in different domains and for different systems. It is also not the biggest risk to mass adoption by a long shot.


There is no indication that this is happening, or that it will happen. Bitcoin's value is derived in part by the cumulative hashing power of its network.


This is true, its one possible way of scaling horizontally. There are many others.


Or you could just use Bitcoin. What if a side chain becomes the required conduit for regulated transactions?
Good intentions and all that. I understand where you are coming from but alt coins serve most of the purposes you state, and for the ones it doesn't we could just use Bitcoin and scale it properly.

There is nothing to support that I am trying to dismantle Bitcoin. Considering I run a bitcoin business, blog about bitcoin, tweet about bitcoin, and otherwise endlessly support bitcoin, your supposition that my thinking on this matter is subversive is absurd. I also don't have a stake in any alt coins, I probably have 1 ltc, and a few doge sitting around, and have blogged extensively about how alt coins are generally scams and you should just use bitcoin. Stop trying to attack my credibility and focus on the arguments, it is easy to verify that what I say is true in this matter.
Its also not a hypothetical or vaguely defined future threat. I've clearly explained the market dynamics that make side chains questionable, and further explained quite succinctly that it may have unintended side effects. I didn't say anything about the core developers, but complex systems are often used in ways that are not intended by people who may be well meaning. You continue to attack but don't address either of these concerns, because they are not addressable. They are flaws in the entire premise. I think side chains will WEAKEN bitcoin by segmenting the network into channels that are controlled by different entities and interests. Its a natural consequence of being able to move the tokens into networks with different rules, different fee structures, different time scales, etc, etc etc.

Alright, I fed the troll long enough. Its been fun. The more you argue for Side chains the more convinced I am that you have a paid agenda, not addressing my core concerns in any meaningful way except to discard them, random attacks, its getting boring.
Its not a nonsensical theory to consider the implications of being able to migrate bitcoin to chains or even non crypto systems controlled by third parties. It's just an unpleasant possibility that people with a financial interest in Side Chains don't want to discuss or propagate. 
The security of the network is absolutely the defining factor of Bitcoin, and keeping that security lead is what ensures its future success. 
You present side chains as the only option for Bitcoin's future, and that just isn't the case. Its an interesting technology that will alter the way Bitcoin works socially and financially in ways that are not clear.
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:42:52
I'm suggesting that a "side chain" is an Alt coin that allows bitcoin to be suspended and "moved" to it in a two way manner. To say that it isn't an alt coin because it has this property is... not accurate. Being pegged to Bitcoin conveys no other value to the "side chain". The value being transferred is set by the creators of the peg, that doesn't mean that it is accurate, and an uninformed user has no mechanism to determine value if its artificially set.


There is nothing obvious about it. The converse is also true, it could be worth more than Bitcoin. Without price discovery we simply do not know its real value.


Well, we could increase the block size, might be a nice place to start. Seems like that should be addressed first. Its also possible to run multiple blockchains in the same client, even without two way pegging and just treat the unit as bitcoin regardless of which chain it is on if we have merged mining acceptance. We haven't implemented pruning, and a bunch of other low level improvements that will decrease disk space and ram requirements.  


No, I want to question the motivations of a company pushing hard to incorporate a technology that doesn't make financial sense to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Considering the adoption of Bitcoin has been largely the result of finely balanced market incentives, this non market-driven approach is suspect. Having alt coins that are not priced competitively based on functionality makes little sense. Who are you to decide what I should pay for the side chain functionality that is being offered? You seem to be entirely dismissing the economic ramifications of side chains, I don't blame you, they don't really have a leg to stand on when it comes to real market dynamics. Its all very hand wavy, understandable.
You claim that side chains provide choice, but without price discovery this isn't true. It strikes me as parasitic rather than helpful.  We can disagree all day about this. 


Right, I derive basically no income from accepting alt coins, and have no stake whatsoever in whether side chains are adopted, except for the fact that it isn't a very good idea and people are being fed a crap ton of fud from users like you who really haven't answered the hard questions as to why we should prefer them to a completely decentralized, disconnected, and vibrant alt coin ecosystem that already exists. You know, the free market.

Braindead moves like this from the big players will help drive acceptance though, that is a good thing. I think I'm ok with this. :)

Its a massively difficult technical project to create a sustainable trust network that is turing complete. The bitcoin blockchain disables tons of its functionality because securing it was a disaster, I expect Ethereum's problems to be magnified several fold.
I also think code storage and execution is overrated. Maybe I'm wrong. When does a smart contract become disabled? Seems like you would have to have to prune them out based on usage over time.
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:27:10
Yes there is a fixed price. You specified it, 1:1. Is a fixed rate. That puts an upper and lower limit on the value of the side coin. Put it another way, there is never any reason to sell 2 sidecoins for 1 bitcoin, if I can sell 2 sidecoins for 2 bitcoin. There is no reason to buy 1 sidecoin for 2 bitcoin, if I can buy 1 sidecoin for 1 bitcoin. So the value of the sidecoin is deterministic and thus not set by market forces.
You said we shouldn't peg bitcoin to the dollar, and you gave a good reason. My argument is that pegging a sidecoin to bitcoin is also a mistake. This isn't about preventing someone from using their Bitcoin. If anything a fixed exchange rate prevents people from trading at the value they perceive, fixed rates between coins limit financial freedom.
Lets give a tangible example. I've built a sidecoin, for the purposes of this discussion I'm going to call it super-risky-coin.  I've pegged super-risky-coin at 1 bitcoin to 100 super-risky-coins. So people who are interested put in their 1 bitcoin and get the agreed upon rate. There is considerable risk in using super-risky-coin, the coding is terrible, the entire system might break. In a normal market driven economy price discovery would tell you this by discounting the price. If the coin is terrible the price should over time converge to its real value, so 1 bitcoin might actually be 10000 super-risky-coins.
The thing is without that discovery mechanism I blindly plow in a bunch of Bitcoin. Now super-risky-coin collapses, I lose my Bitcoin because the information about the relative risks was hidden in the deterministic rate.
Obviously you can create the flip example, of an asset and chain that is undervalued. If someone creates a chain that is better than Bitcoin we would expect Bitcoin to trade into it at a discount. By removing the risk/price incentive you are just creating a system of parallel blockchains that are equivalent, scale, not differentiation. This doesn't encourage innovation.

@_date: 2014-12-29 18:45:39
No, because they run in their own blockchains. The idea is that you have another chain running independently, where value is transferred between them to preserve digital scarcity. It ignores the fact that in order to be as secure as bitcoin it needs to be merge mined thus adopted by a large number of miners, and that the value is deterministic instead of free-market driven. A point I've tried to make above but that people aren't following, I probably need to do a much better job of explaining the market dynamics behind that.
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:47:43
It isn't being moved around, it is becoming un-spendable. I understand the argument about network donation but... You can't say on one hand that Bitcoin is of limited quantity and has value, and on the other that it is infinitely divisible. If the latter is ultimately true than there is no fixed quantity of Bitcoin. Digital scarcity can't be maintained if the rules of the network are altered to increase available supply. If there was an expectation of that happening than no proof-of-burn should ever affect the value of Bitcoin (because the market should price in the expectation of an increase of future supply) and the network donation argument becomes invalid. My point regarding capital is that there are better uses for money than making it un-spendable, like injecting it into the creation of products and services.

I think the key here is that people who did make a lot of money in Bitcoin should band together to create new VC firms. Trying to break into the existing oligarchy is almost impossible, but there is enough money available in BTC to create an investment focused hedge fund entirely in digital currency and focused on digital currency. We have seen a bit of that already with seedcoin and havelock investments, but there are other small groups trying to do the same thing. 
People with shared interests should be able to pool their capital and have it invested on their behalf on companies in the space that are building potentially break out technologies. It is a high risk/ high reward type of game. I think most of the BTC investment going on is highly unstructured, decentralized might be a better word. ;)

The transaction can't be finalized until the cumulative value of the inputs &gt; then the amount of the output. The default wallet software doesn't work this way, so it wasn't clear to me exactly how this all fit together. I get it now. Thanks :) It seems to me that there is still an element of centralization in that inputs need to be shared among participants or aggregates at a central place. The client also needs to lock them so that they aren't double spent.

There is a 257 byte difference between an uncompressed keypair and a compressed one. The first byte denotes the compression, but the uncompressed key includes the full 256 bit Y coordinate. If the keypair they are generating on the paper wallet is compressed then the address is different, but the uncompressed keypair can be reconstituted and used on the uncompressed address. Anyway, its a big mistake. They should be 100% standardized on compressed keys. I spent way too long dealing with the intricacies of this on my own platform. :)

Because it makes it sound in some way equivalent to Bitcoin, which is isn't.


Well, you mean in exactly the same way an alt coin increases scalability without increasing resource requirements of a full node? By running another chain. I don't think that is as valuable as you think, the vast majority of users don't run full nodes, and the resource requirements are not exactly heavy by modern standards. Fewer people may participate as resource requirements go up, if they go up disproportionately to the general markets ability to absorb those changes in the form of cheaper bandwidth, ram and disk.


No it isn't. Sorry.


That is easy to say, but who knows what the future holds. I think it provides a very convenient migration path away from Bitcoin as the system is envisioned now.


Again, speculation. What if I have to use a side chain to do a certain type of transaction, or interface with a certain network, or a certain provider. Side coins are not Bit coins. So if such a conversion was necessary it would necessitate me paying a rate that was not market driven but determined by the gate keeper of that side chain. If you say they are redeemable that may be true, but consider that a transaction on the side chain network could have a completely different unit cost than on the Bitcoin network which would disproportionately affect the conversion back as an example.


Its not clear that they help Bitcoin compete better, I'm not advocating pushing risky features into Bitcoin. I think scale is the biggest issue to address.


You are advocating something that potentially decreases the freedoms of Bitcoin users, but packaging it like it is freeing them into a world that they didn't have before. Its not so cut and dry. I like having altcoins as a security wall from the core bitcoin network, letting you exchange value at a fixed rate is fundamentally flawed.


Not really. I think the points I have presented are very logical and based on thinking about the economic theory behind the operation of side chains. If you think of Bitcoin as a hybrid solution that is both carefully balanced incentive and technological innovation then changing the mix should be carefully approached.


I think that we should DEFINE the risks, and have a conversation about why allowing you to transfer bitcoins to an alt coin that isn't priced by the market is a good idea technically and economically. Without pricing you don't have information as to relative merits. Price discovery is one of the most important market concepts that exists, why are we simply sweeping it under the rug like it doesn't matter?

The point is that running code in the blockchain is interesting but completely unnecessary. A much more robust system can be built using existing infrastructure. We already have a turing complete system its called a computer. We already have a concensus network its called Bitcoin. About the only thing that Ethereum could potentially create that is novel is autonomous services, but if a service is valuable there is no reason why someone couldn't run it on a smart contract platform. I think hybridization with existing systems is a far more likely road to success than a turing complete model built right into a single consensus network.

I hope the price of Bitcoin collapses. The asset bubble has been terrible for the fungibility of the currency. People don't spend it when they believe it has nowhere to go but up.

I'm not sure why proof of existence would destroy any Bitcoins. You are timestamping on the chain, you can spend the coins to yourself so long as there is an indelible record. Also stamping multiple documents in a single transaction makes sense, although I'm not sure how they are doing that give the OP_RETURN limits.
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:22:35
Please, just concisely explain why having a pegged asset is better than one that is priced by the market for two things that are not equivalent in any way.


That is exactly what it is. The special characteristic you define is not necessarily beneficial to bitcoin.


What inflation? Having multiple alt coins is not inflation if they have different utility or features and are thus different. Side chains preserve digital scarcity, but are not equivalent, and over time unfairly priced one way or the other by definition. 


Why is it desirable to split the load amongst bitcoin-backed currencies? If we want to increase the bitcoin network by a factor of 5 we need to run 4 other side chains. For these chains to be equivalent we would need the same number of peers, and the same cumulative hashing power as the main network, which equals the total amount of power and space we would need to proportionally scale a single chain already. So in that sense we are not scaling up so much as designing a load shedding system.


I have a doubt. Anyone who has been paying attention should also.


The road to hell and good intentions and all that. If I was playing devil's advocate I would say that you couldn't design a more perfect backdoor into bitcoin if you were trying to build a migration path away from the existing technology.


Until it isn't? For example when you need a sidechain network to accomplish a specific task, in a certain jurisdiction? It seems to me that if I was building a premium network that ran alongside bitcoin, a sidechain would be a great way to do it, like taking the highway instead of the side streets. Since sidechains don't restrict fees I don't see why I couldn't charge whatever I wanted if you needed it badly enough.


Right now you can take your bitcoin and trade it anywhere for anything, this lets you trade it at a rate determined by a third party into a chain potentially controlled by an organization or government, or pretty much anyone else. So I'm not sure why you say this is helping Bitcoin freedom when it could easily be subverted. 


Competing alt coins aren't a competitive risk. If someone does come up with something truly better we will sell bitcoin and everyone will move, thats life. The same thing would happen in a side chain economy. With bitcoin's network effect and hash power lead that seems unlikely. Alt coins are the boogeyman in the room come to steal our bitcoins and dilute our network value.
Listen, we don't agree, but I'm not spreading FUD. There are potential ramifications to this change that haven't been addressed, and a lot of commercial interest to push it through. I would like to see the pitch deck that got blockstream 21 million, I bet it includes some interesting ideas as to how to monetize separate and distinct side chains.

You may not like it, you may disagree, but you would be wrong. I've tried to explain, and I understand the technical arguments you have made, but market dynamics tend to win in the end, you can't fight it.
I want Bitcoin to compete and not be overwhelmed by corporate interests. I don't think providing a migration path away from Bitcoin is in the best interest of anyone except those who would control it and exploit it for financial gain. I would rather spend resources scaling and improving the network in ways that don't have such a clear potential for abuse down the line. A little bit of foresight goes a very long way. If I can identify many ways to abuse side chains in just a few minutes, you can expect them to happen sooner or later.


I don't like that idea either. I also think its unrealistic based on the hash power lead that bitcoin has, and that side chains do not provide the assurances against disruption that you claim.

This let them entrench themselves for years, a strategy that ultimately failed with low cost decentralized Internet access. Coinbase doesn't have the same luxury.  All of their infrastructure is easily replicated and in fact they rely heavily on vast amounts of technology they don't control  (the Bitcoin network), and there are tens of thousands of companies that if they had incentive could do it better (banks, forex desks, etc).
In fact, we already see multiple competitors in exactly the same space that not only have money but are backed by industry veterans (Circle, Bitreserve) and we will see more. First mover advantage is completely overrated.

This is a good idea, something that I have been advocating for a while. That being said mass adoption is very tricky, I would rather see digital currency micro-payment tied to OAuth2/OpenID. I would be willing to pay several times the transaction fee in order to have guaranteed secure service login on more sensitive sites.

This is the one thing that annoys me also. SO many altcoins talk about shorter transaction times like it matters, and unsophisticated users are easily swayed by bs. The reality is that the orphan rate shoots up, and network propagation becomes a huge problem. Other people in the thread have commented about this, but there are real scale problems with just increasing the block rate.

There is a lot of inference in the typical block explorer... I'm not sure what the market would look like for a strictly pure technically oriented one though. Probably why we haven't seen it.  It would be nice to be able to turn off some of heuristics like address balances though and get right to the raw unspents.
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:22:40
This just isn't true, and ignores basic free market principles. I'm not saying I don't see any value in side chains, I think as a mechanism for increasing scale for the main network it will be very useful. I also think its an interesting mechanism for experimentation if the hashing power is equivalent / merge mined with the main network.
That being said, the reason things don't have fixed prices has nothing to do with creating huge income for traders, and just reflects the reality of supply, demand, and market economics. You are saying that if a side chain is more useful it shouldn't be more expensive, and if its less useful it shouldn't be cheaper.  There is no fixed resource in the world where that argument holds true. 
Bitcoin itself float freely against every other currency in the world, if it was possible to peg it at $300 a Bitcoin should we do it? Anyone who has long term aspirations for its success would say that was crazy. A fixed deterministic mechanism for assigning value does not reflect the reality that the relative value of technologies and services changes over time, period.
@_date: 2014-05-18 15:47:06
Yeah, valid questions. There are lots of different types of voting, I haven't thought through all of the possibilities. I'm not sure what you mean by rating the options, isn't that a vote unto itself from a fixed set? Voting against choices you don't like seems straightforward. I don't think you can correlate the vote outside of the governing body. The only sticky part is that each person should only be allowed to have one valid vote (or sequence of votes).I don't think you do this by verifying their keypair, just by giving them an anonymized token. In  a low security environment that could be generated from a website username, a real election would want real identity management tied to distributing that token. In any event I am planning on launching a little information site about this, and gathering people interested in discussing or implementing these types of systems. I'll post what I have thus far on my blog tomorrow or the next day and follow up with you. My white paper on the subject isn't quite done.

It isn't about instant gratification so much as a function of price discovery and liquidity. An exchange on the blockchain proper is a terrible idea, but it keeps coming up. Linked and centralized exchanges are incredibly efficient at price discovery.  Andreas is a really smart guy, but insofar as I can tell he doesn't have any more experience with building exchanges than Mt. Gox did. There is a lack of real technical knowledge in that area in the community. The key is to establish trust worthy actors, and to separate the roles and responsibilities of elements of the system. That means we need good and separate escrow facilities, clearing houses, multiple centralized and possibly regulated exchanges etc, etc, etc. The entire infrastructure needs to be built.
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:31:52
What is the methodology for this? Any growth rate statistics in the US?
@_date: 2014-09-06 02:58:18
I'm not saying it doesn't have short term use case, but we have a network that doesn't have the traditional overhead of the banking sector, and now we are strapping traditional ATMs and overhead onto it. If we can do perfect digital cash delivery we really shouldn't need ATMs, and if we do people will just integrate digital currency into the existing ATM network. So, its a short term play, and I think will be shown to be very similar to these 1994 commercials. :)

Its probably a major use case for distributed identity. I'm just commenting that people are always trying to fit anything new into the box that already exists.

I was going to reply about this aging out of the  mempool, or rebroadcasting a higher fee tx. Until, I realized that neither one of those  things will work. With the current state of the code you need to wait until a miner relays it, but given that they have no incentive it might take a while.
Seems like tx purging is going to work its way into the code into the not-too-distant future though.

There will just be a tiered system, just like there is now. People who use the legal acceptable version, and the people using the illegal underground version. It is much more difficult to implement some of these technologies than you imagine, and I think we will see substantial advances in the anonymity of crypto currency by 2025. It is hard to imagine how sophisticated these systems could get by then. Shit we may not even have currency if we hit the singularity. ;)

It depends on how you handle identity management and token distribution. You certainly can't allow anonymous distribution of voting tokens, but if were to use established mechanisms for identity verification you could very easily leverage blockchain tech.

The ecosystem supports both. Sometimes centralized services make sense, sometimes they don't. Some services are extraordinarily difficult to build in a decentralized fashion. This will get easier in time, but in the meantime we need more proliferation of services and options regardless of how they are built.
We are only now seeing decent libraries and infrastructure for building centralized applications, it will take a while to get all the pieces we need to build really awesome distributed ones on a wide scale basis. A lot of talk around Ethereum and other distributed technologies, but little in delivery. These are some of the hardest problems in computer science, and it is going to take a while to make real decentralized apps a reality.
@_date: 2014-09-17 03:50:33

Yeah, so you can't automatically take the student's Bitcoin. You can have them prepay, and then take money as appropriate from an address you control, or you can invoice them. I don't know how you handle it for non-bitcoin payment right now, I imagine the latter. So you just want to provide a pure bitcoin invoice and then split the payment out on delivery as well as notifying your system that the payment occurred so you can modify whatever internal state you have that keeps track of this stuff.
Coinlock essentially does this all internally. There weren't any services that did it at the time, or still as far as I know, so I built it. I've thought about creating a way to sell random tokens as part of the service so that you could sell redeemable items so to speak. I guess I could be persuaded to open up some of my infrastructure as a payments API if there was a compelling business case. You are right though, its a pain to build that from scratch. It might make more sense just to take payments direct and pay out manually in the short term.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:41:17

Everyone is talking about sidechains like they are fundamentally different than altcoins, but they aren't. They provide 1 function that is different and that is exchange of value between chains in a deterministic way.

Uniquely identify versus identity are too different things. Maybe I don't understand all of the implications of your original proposal, you should draft up a white paper or a technical breakdown of how you would build it. I don't think you need to look much farther than the blockchain proper, the address space is sparse, who cares how many are used in a single vote. I'll write up my proposal and I'd love to see more detail on yours.

I think we are only going to see this if people start open sourcing the code involved in remittances. The entire pipeline and related interfaces need to be open source from ingestion to delivery. Once the payment network itself is federated the rate of change will accelerate. Right now we are in the middlemen stage, where everybody and their brother tries to insert themselves in the money transfer process.

Coinprism is a web based platform with a set of apis for doing certain coloring transactions. I'm not trying to compete with them by offering a duplicate set of apis and services. Ember is a full hosted platform, i.e it has services for running multiple wallets internally, building complex transactions between them, and intelligently handling keys, signing, etc. It abstracts away a lot of the specifics of building color coin infrastructure into a middleware layer. This lets you build very complex infrastructure quickly using us as either a hosted or locally deployed gateway. 
Does that make sense? Its the difference between offering an API or library, and offering an end-to-end platform. A lot of companies are offering cloud API services, but in order to use those effectively you need a lot of other infrastructure (i.e for key management) which they don't provide.
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:04:46
I've been running quite a few nodes for a while, but if anything I think we will see more centralization. The cost to run them keeps going up, and simply acting as a relay doesn't provide any monetary incentive, perhaps it should.
That being said 7500+ nodes is quite a healthy network, it would be interesting to see a graph of their geographic location to see how much centralization we have of the infrastructure physically. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:22:58
I agree with the general assessment that this should not be pointing to a commercial site. I understand wanting to position a company as synonymous with Bitcoin, and pushing products and services that way, but it isn't in the spirit of the community. A better way would be to cobrand a version of Bitcoin.org, that speaks to the wider issues and also positions the brand as being the best way to interact with it.

There are lots of types of tickets. Certain ones like movie tickets, concert tickets, and other forms of light digitial property make a lot of sense on a shared ledger like the blockchain because it promotes secondary markets, and the ability to share, sell, or transfer to other people outside of the 'walled garden' of the particular ticket issuing company.
Others like plane tickets, are heavily tied to identity and other internal systems and cannot simply be sold to a third party because the entity doesn't want it to happen. Airlines try to protect their revenue by limiting transfers and otherwise making it harder for second markets to develop.

Supporting SPV is neat, but if you are  connecting to an intermediate server anyway, just have it do the heavy lifting. All it has to do is manage unspents for you. It doesn't have any way of hijacking your coins. I guess worst case it could feed you some fake transactions data, but that still doesn't create any kind of compromise it just makes it a worthless wallet service.

A valid concern. It certainly isn't ideal, we need to get people on p2pool and create better incentives around decentralized mining. I just don't see an imminent threat, sure they could get hacked but it would cost them a ton of money so hopefully they are spending some of their coin on security.

The block size needs to be increased. It is one step in a number of steps that need to be taken to ensure that the network continues to grow, and that we have a chance at mainstream acceptance. If we don't scale the network it will become increasingly congested and irrelevant. 
I understand the argument that reducing the market incentive for other solutions like the lightening network by increasing the block size might delay those long term fixes from getting produced more quickly, but I also think its deeply irresponsibly to entirely rely on something that isn't even off the drawing board. Essentially by delaying these types of changes we are playing with fire, hoping that something better will come along and be pervasive quickly. Scale fixes and a consensus library are the two most important things in Bitcoin development right now in my opinion if we value long term success.

Right, but again this is far from an apples to apples comparison. Almost any programmer can build forum software, the same can't be said for specialized knowledge related to trading and other financial disciplines. Also, comparing contract rate is a bit silly, since this is a long term contract it would make a lot of sense just to hire full time employees or an external agency to build this, either option would be substantially less expensive. Even in finance the &gt; $300k per year full time programmer is a rarity.

Its interesting, but it would be nice to get a good example of how this works. It still seems pretty hand wavy to me. Ultimately their database was hacked, in Factom the land title records can be hacked by an administrator also, its not a magic bullet to solve government corruption. Maybe the fact that the system is open will make it more easy to audit individual changes.
I think the exact same technology could simply be done with a data warehousing solution that checksums data onto the blockchain and has open apis for data access, without any of the complexity or ambiguity of their Factoid run factom chain that runs parallel to Bitcoin.

I think it comes down to access, and also price stability. We are seeing better applications all of the time that make it easier to use Bitcoin as kind of the intermediary between disparate payment systems. I read the RFI and for their use cases you would probably need a separate application even if you ultimately paid via Bitcoin. That is unfortunate because it would be nice to just pay and go, but there are limitations that make that tricky. The system is so awful now that I'm just glad they are really rethinking how to create a hassle-free experience.

If you are just starting to code then I would recommend Javascript. Not necessarily because it is the best language for Bitcoin (although the Bitcore guys may disagree) but because it is just used absolutely everywhere. It is as close to ubiquitous as languages get. It's also well paid, and used throughout the industry on both the front and back end. Easy to pick up, difficult to really master, that type of thing.
If you want to graduate from there to Java or C++ that will give you the context to write more sophisticated applications that interface with the low level protocol. I wouldn't start there though, lots of cognitive load, and a ton of up front time. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:21:32
Sure, but there are other ways to store data rather than local or monolithic databases. I would imagine that transactions are signed in the client and then just federated out to nodes that are essentially relays. Anyway, just spit balling, I have no way of knowing how they are set up. However, when I hear database failure took the site down I think there might be a design issue.
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:07:22
Well, its just a very monolithic approach. I'm not saying its bad, but its limiting. When I think about building application stacks I think about redundancy, scalability and a host of other factors. That means high availability of resource in case of failure, and an easy way of pushing data into multiple storage back-ends that can handle different types of work loads. This single/failover database approach is very simplistic. You need to be able to shard your data quickly and effectively. Yes, I know this  is possible with Postgres, but if I was thinking scale I'm not sure I would use postgres. Almost everything in the blockchain can be modeled as key/value. ACID matters but not at this level, the blockchain can be replayed and stored independant of services for initiating transactions.
Anyway, a full discussion of the architecture is probably beyond a reddit post. I built the first version of Coinlock 14  months ago entirely on a Postgres backed database populated and accessed via Ruby api. Its an obvious approach, but when I step back and think about building robust applications I think it falls short. I'm surprised that this  is the path that Coinbase is following to build out their infrastructure.I guess in their case most transactions are off-chain anyway, its a different problem space than what the api-centric companies are trying to do.

The blockchain as a mechanism for real digital ownership is absolutely trans-formative. I'm convinced that we will see these technologies be integrated into products and services all over the world, and you are absolutely right, there is a real opportunity to change the way things are done.

The charges weren't brought, but there is contextual evidence that he meant to hurt people littered in the documentation he wrote himself. So it helps to put his operation into context and dispels the idea that he was naive and simply wandered into a vast criminal enterprise, instead of actively and methodically building it. I think we have to separate the criminal activity vs the idealism of his initial ideas. He did vastly enrich himself at the expense of other people, several of whom were hurt or killed. He sold weapons, and poison (cyanide), in addition to drugs and documents. It's hard to reconcile his idealism with the hard facts of running what morphed into a syndicate that parlayed drugs and weapons to other syndicates, this wasn't entirely a website to person operation by any means. The judge didn't hand out a sentence without due consideration, she was exceptionally thorough in her analysis.

Things are definitely progressing, but if anything I am surprised by how early things really are. Bitcoin has gotten really disproportionate exposure in the media and otherwise compared with the size of the community, or general adoption.
So for all the good news recently we really have a long way to go to displace the entrenched machinery that exists now. Especially in really well defined markets like the US. We need more proliferation of payments in developing economies where there are few established players and little infrastructure. Many of those economies are also key markets for remittances.

This is something I happen to know quite a bit about. There are a lot of misconceptions around what HFT is, how it works, and who it benefits. It has a lot to do with providing liquidity, routing around market instability, and decreasing the bid/ask spread. If you look at the historical price for an equities trade it has dropped dramatically. Where before brokers captured excessive fees, massive price pressure has reduced the cost of doing business where the average person can drop in and out of the market for under $5.  There is no proof that the spreads are exploding, that is a myth perpetuated by banks that see their profits from slow investor flow evaporating in the face of competitive price pressure. It is easy to confirm, look at  historical spread data. Normal people aren't competing with HFTs, the banks are. Someone has to pay for a robust liquidity network, and that function as fallen to the HFT players.

I'll consider it. The thing is Coinlock was written before any of the modern apis existed, and is also heavily tied to Amazon's infrastructure for queue management, address storage, and bitcoind provisioning. So even if I released the code it wouldn't be something most people could easily get working anyway. 
There are tons of ways to improve it, but at the end of the day there wasn't the user throughput necessary to make it sustainable. I think a service like it will eventually thrive, but it will be a while.

Single issue assets come up a lot. I've heard it advocated in alternative color coin protocols. I think audit trail is more important than issuance. If you can publicly audit available quantities and issue dates you have enough public information to determine value. Similarly in a system that doesn't allow repeat issuance you are limited to fixed quantities which doesn't really reflect how backed assets are maintained in the real world.

I think you are underestimating the need to attract institutional market makers to new and risky markets. Market makers have obligations with respect to providing liquidity that far exceed those of everyday traders. They are usually required to post a spread regardless of market conditions or prices.

Wait what do you mean? Address exchange would work the same as p2sh, do you mean you can't determine how the redemption script is made?

I think node requirements will go up, but that doesn't mean centralization. 6000 nodes isn't alot, I expect companies and remittance agents all over the place to take up the slack if the network is important and useful. At 1 megabyte it's not clear that it can survive, weird things will happen in the mempool and otherwise if transactions are steadily building up in memory and never committed. Not doing anything is dangerous also.
Storage and bandwidth costs continue to plummet, costs for running nodes is decreasing. An increase in block size is critical to the growth of the network. If we don't do it the net effect is centralization in the form of off chain systems like Coinbase, and a network that is simply too expensive to use peer to peer for most transactions. Let's give ourselves sine breathing room while other solutions such as channels and hub and spoke have time to develop.

I think it would be interesting if we had some way of actually measuring bandwidth of currently active full nodes. What are the tolerances of the nodes already on the network? I don't think it's a question we can answer right now with any degree of certainty, but I would guess the vast majority of nodes are already on broadband networks either home or in data centers. 
Maybe we can approximate by looking at the ip addresses of all known nodes and tying them to either residential or carrier blocks? Must be some other source of data that could help in building a better picture.

You can insert any data into an OP_RETURN transaction, including data that mimics open assets protocol messages, and if a client were to naively read this data and take it at face value then you could forge colored coins. 
However, if the client follows the protocol all the way back to the origination of the coin it can validate every intermediate transaction and make sure that the rules are followed correctly. If they aren't then the data gets uncolored.
If you take a detailed read at the protocol spec you can see how it integrates fairly well into what is already there.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:26:27
It is enough for block explorer functionality, but that neither here nor there. The point is that its possible to make efficient code that can handle even large amount of data on the blockchain proper with minimal overhead. If you get into generic db storage it doesn't scale well, even at 2mb every ten minutes eventually you get into trouble.  And a 1TB disk can be put in a laptop now. Disk space is getting cheaper all of the time.

The device cannot possibly be making the payments itself. If anything it has to participate in a group transaction with hundreds of other devices, and more realistically everything will be proxied through 21. Each output has to be at least 600 (598?) satoshis, and the fee is roughly 10000 satoshis (Variable based on confirm time). Maybe its possible to roll this into some kind of payment channel, but not convinced. 
So we have a device that mines satoshis, which it cannot directly use. Its also a fixed hardware platform when the actual difficulty keeps increasing, meaning as time goes on its less and less capable of interacting with the network. To be specific it mines in general, and the block reward gets distributed across the entire network as a percentage of work done like a p2pool situation.
That doesn't sound like a good plan, regardless of whether or not they are trying to make micro payment happen in a secure way. We already have a mechanism for doing this, its called software. Its trivial to bake in transaction signing into software components running on commodity devices, and then bake in microtransactions connected to accounts for the owners of those devices or directly refill them with bitcoin. We then put the mining hardware in a data center where it can actually be upgraded and isn't sitting completely inaccessible and useless in the field.
It may even make sense to build a custom chip to do this (although probably not), but having it mine is lunacy.
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:42:49
You mean something like a physical version of Coinlock? ;)
I prototyped a device that triggered real world interactions based on blockchain payments on startupbus a year and a half ago.

I'm interested in people's memory usage numbers, my nodes run at 700+ megabytes on 64 bit, and I've seen memory usage peak at 1.2 gb. Would be good to get more statistics. Seems like mempool plus indexing, but this is a default config.
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:56:17
I think the idea of having a chip embedded into everything that can interact with blockchain technologies, have micro payment channels, and store and forward payments is very smart. 
I think the idea of having every one of these chips mining, or in any way contributing to the mining network by siphoning power from people's home and businesses to enrich others or acquire 'points' or loyalty for using electricity is fairly terrible. 
There isn't anything wrong with supporting such a use case, but making it the dominant one doesn't seem good. If this type of technology does go mainstream though the value of the network would soar.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:32:38
That is true, and also unnecessary given the functionality we already have.
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:59:24
I think the issue with change is around electrum giving you change to an address not imported into the blockchain wallet,resulting in inaccessible funds. You would have to import  the keypairs for all transactions on the other wallet. Since they aren't both based on the same deterministic seed, this will cause issues if you want your full balance accessible from both locations.
Also, address reuse isn't inherently insecure, its just theoretically less secure because the public key for the transaction is fully exposed. However, if private keys can be derived from  having access to the full public key then public key cryptography is broken, and we all have bigger issues. Exposing the public key fully is the norm in most crypto implementations, pgp etc.

Sure, but I don't think a laptop is a reasonable target for a global financial network. You don't run full bgp routing tables on your laptop. It's similarly very limiting saying we are happy with these arbitrary specs when very few nodes even now run on such low end hardware. By the time the blockchain reaches 1 terabyte a multi terabyte ssd should be 100 bucks.
I think an algorithmic approach will ultimately make sense, but in the short term this increase gives us the breathing room necessary to make long term changes. The thing about these types of growth curves is that if we aren't pro active we run the risk of network collapse. Time isn't on our side right now.

I'm not really angry about it, I just don't see it as very productive. Instead of trying to paint one protocol in a negative light, just talk about the specific use cases that are a better fit for what you have. Its not going to be a winner takes all situation in asset technology. A rising tide raises all boats, etc. There are clearly cases where open assets isn't the right solution, and there are many cases still left where none of the existing color coin products are applicable. 
I've built a lot of stuff around open assets, but only because I perceived an installed base that would be immediately cross compatible. Its not because I think its the only game in town. As this whole sector evolves services and middleware will be multi protocol, its just the way it will happen.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:06:15
Well it depends on your jurisdiction. Coinlock is based in Florida, and based on the legal opinion I got we were in good standing. Like anything new few precedents have been set, so it's impossible to know with 100% certainty.
It depends heavily on specifics. Maybe you should write to a generic interface abd then let the user enter their own credentials for the block service used.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:35:42
So the crux of your argument is that being able to issue additional fungible assets is bad because you can't secure them, but the same company prints out a 100,000,000 gold bonds since they only get one issuance still has to secure the 99,000,000 gold bonds they haven't distributed, and are subject to the same security problems as another issuance mostly related to key management. 
You further argue that  in the case of open assets someone could dilute the total amount available thus reducing the value of any given instrument, but again we get into trusting the issuer. It doesn't matter if I issue 1 or 1 billion gold bonds if I won't redeem them or am insolvent in the real world, the value is essentially nothing. This value is orthogonal to the issuance. There are some assets where that isn't true, but again, proof-of-reserves is necessary to establish value not outstanding quantity. 
Finally you talk about evidence destruction. Its trivial to track creation of assets on the blockchain, if someone is printing notes like crazy you have a record, but again we get into trust. Nobody is going to print out 100 notes if they think they can sell a million, especially if they only get one shot. See point 
So your contention that a single issuance is some kind of feature is very much up for debate. In many tokenized applications especially ones driven by machines and not assets a single issuance is a liability as we need an increasing supply of fungible tokens. From a technical perspective we could easily lock open assets into single issuance with a minor change to the protocol, by uncoloring issuances past the first if that was in any way desirable.
I think all of the points you specify as weaknesses and deficiencies I consider strengths in open assets. It  is a tokenization platform, and limiting its capabilities with single issuance just doesn't make any sense, issuers should have the flexibility of managing supply based on the total amount available in the real world. In the case of an honest issuer leads to greater market information in real time. Printing out some obscene number in the beginning gives you a total outstanding  shares that isn't in line with the amount actually available or circulating. 
Again, both of these technologies will continue to exist, its not an all or nothing situation. While we are bickering about colored coins  counterparty pretty much came and ate the cake anyway. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:26:12
Can you elaborate as to the technical differences? How have you tested compatibility with coinprism? There are a lot of edge cases around overflow, and muti-issue/multi-transfer, partial fill etc, that a cursory look at your public code doesn't seem to address.
Edit:  For example, look at this
and compare with
What accounts for the difference? Shouldn't they be near identical? Coins.assemby lists 17 stakeholders, Coinprism 335.  Could be a db paging issue, but the total number of coins differs in the main issuing address, and the total issuance isn't shown on coin.assembly. This makes me think that your implementation might not be compatible which could lead to uncoloring in the worst case. I ran through several of the assets listed in the Coinprism directory and none of them add up correctly, either in total outputs, or total issuance.

How scalable is Factom? Can I reliable store hundreds of gigabytes of land records? What about terabytes? How quick is search and retrieval on large data sets?
Would you say its easier to build applications on top of a Factom chain, or an established solution like a database? What about finding people to maintain, support, and secure such a solution?
Could you explain the consensus system in more detail? How does it protect against external attack? Nodes that misrepresent themselves, etc? There was the notion that you were using a modified Raft algorithm, could you elaborate?
Factom can't prevent bad data from getting into the system, it can only help audit it once it does. How do you handle retractions for bad data?
Finally, people keep bringing up databases. Isn't it functionally equivalent to simply build a changeset of a database within a 10 minute window, hash it, push that to the blockchain and then replicate the data? There are well established mechanisms to do this already, why ultimately use a new data storage and consensus mechanism that throws away the last thirty years of database development and the associated application stacks? What is the killer feature that makes that exchange worth it?

This is a tremendously good thing for Bitcoin. It highlights the immense capability of the technology, it represents backing and trust by a major financial technology player, and it signals to the wider community that this is a real thing that they need to pay attention to.
From a valuation perspective, they need to utilize Bitcoin in order to leverage the network, which means that the price should go up as transaction volume increases. This should also serve as a warning that the scale issues of the network matter, and preparing it for these types of mainstream players is critical to its long term success.

and yet we have how many full nodes, 8000? Do you think its worth decreasing the blocksize to 1/2 megabyte so we can accommodate a network of 16000+ machines? We have to balance the goals of the network, its a given that usage is going to increase one way or the other, coming up with a sensible plan to expand capacity is a big deal. Your with blockstream right? How are you going to accomodate moving value back and forth between multiple chains with a 4 tps limit? It seems to me that increasing the capacity of the bitcoin network goes hand and hand with your core value proposition. You can't utilize the other networks if you can't get to them or its too expensive to transfer value.

Bitcoin has validation rules just like colored coin clients. A sybil attack is when the data is forged by a large number of peers, but valid colored coin data can't be forged because the origination of a color can only happen from the first non coinbase input and by extension the key or keys that control that input.
Give the protocol spec a look, under issuance.

Just data publishing. So you can establish an oracle for pushing updates onto the blockchain. It lets you do really decentralized command and control, so  I could be publishing on one system and consume that data feed somewhere else, have actions occur based on that event etc.

I read this and scratched my head for a bit.  I checked out the code and to be specific what it looks like it is creating a p2sh transaction with a non standard redeem script.

Moore's law should apply to the blockchain also. If we can't do 20 megabyte blocks in 2016 we are more than a little behind the curve. Yes, there will be some increase in centralization but that is almost inevitable with scale. There are plenty of people who are going to run full nodes at 20 megabyte blocks, myself included.
@_date: 2015-05-10 14:51:28
We have no n indication that the number of nodes declining has to do with bandwidth. It's always been 1 megabyte and we use to have double the nodes. I think that's a clear indication that it has to do with something else, more than likely the proliferation of spv clients.
Working on node incentives and reducing resources is important, but at 1 mb blocks the network will become irrelevant quickly for mass adoption. We are rapidly approaching the limits of the current network.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:22:11
I can't believe this discussion is still on going. We have known for a long time that either limits needed to be adjusted intelligently, or alternative solutions have to be built. The reality I think is that both have to happen. A real lightening network implementation is how far off? Six months at least (more like a year)? How long will it take that technology to filter into the wallets, exchanges, and the massive ecosystem built around Bitcoin? Even if Strawpay were to be adopted today it could take a significant amount of time to integrate it into the network and the tools that most people use. 
Whats the short term solution for a vastly growing mempool because we can't insert the transactions fast enough into 1MB blocks, just dump them and submit to continual rebroadcasts? At what point does that rebroadcast mechanism saturate the network, should transaction exponentially back off? If we don't dump them from ram, how quickly is ram exhausted on the typical bitcoin node? When do the low end nodes start crashing?
Bitcoin is hairy, and complicated, and uncharted in many ways. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies building blockchain technology, applications, and services. I think the biggest issue is that there is a practical solution that is not ideal at all, vs no proposed solution except to tweak things a bit and wait and see while other workarounds are developed. 
How many people run full BGP routing tables here? Please, no route aggregation. Anyone? Raise of hands. Is the internet decentralized?
The demographics of decentralization change when the utility of the network goes up, big companies get involved, governments, and other major interests, that doesn't mean its not decentralized, its just not the ultra-decentralization that occurs when everyone is a 100% equal participant.
Of course, finding any system in the real world where everyone is an equal participant is basically impossible. Even life itself is vastly unequal in the way it plays out for people, let alone the distribution of any tangible resource like compute power, disk, memory and bandwidth.
I feel that this discussion has a political philosophy at its core rather than some good old fashioned engineering. Let's engineer the better solution. If its not big blocks lets get a real formal proposal of an alternative, let's see the source code, let's test it on a merged mined alt coin. But let's not bicker that there is some fundamental moral issue with big blocks, because its against the spirit of bitcoin, and instead build a globally used pervasive crypto currency outside of the control of any individual entity. That isn't happening at 3 txns a seconds, no matter how you shake it. I think the reality is that there is nothing else on the table now.
I think the XT software fork is a reasonable approach in some ways, but really we should be using a straight copy of bitcoind with just the necessary block size changes as the voting factor. Bringing in the other issues and tech in the fork is muddying the waters. Bitcoin needs to grow up to succeed, and we should all be working to make that happen or we risk failure.
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:54:59
But follow that to its logical conclusion and we could over time cause serious damage to the monetary supply through extended proof of burn across distributed applications. Online trading systems like Ebay, have managed to do extraordinarily well with just reviews as a mechanism for reputation management.

Maybe. Its not really possible to know, but I suspect people will want their data on the blockchain. The easiest path is for users to move to alternative networks  if they can.  Its speculative either way, but if the network grows in way we don't expect with respect to on-chain transactions it could undermine bitcoin's long term growth.

@_date: 2015-05-19 16:04:37
So the point I'm making is that if your colored coin wallet is compatible it won't let you send assets to a btc address, only a properly encoded color address.
You are saying that the crowdsale automatically kicks back tokens to the address btc came from, but that means the crowdsale software isn't compliant. The address should be an encoded one so  that the user can't spend bitcoin to it on a normal wallet, and the btc address should include a place to put the return color coin address.
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:09:20
Well thats how btcd approaches it, and its really the only reasonable way. That being said I think a re-implementation is useful but we really need to think collectively about how to build a better platform for blockchain services and applications.
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:22:55
I get it, but as I said the white paper is insufficient. The bitcoin white paper is 9 pages, after which you can understand the fundamentals of bitcoin. The factom paper is 38 after which I'm not sure I understand at all why its constructed the way it is.  I guess I could dig through the source code extensively, but to what end? Factom reminds me of a solution searching for a problem, that could easily be remedied with myriad tools. Nobody would even begin to claim that Factom is a better data warehouse in terms of raw capabilities than Oracle, or even Postgres both of which have 30+ years of continuous development, and a rich developer ecosystem, i.e when Paul snow was starting his career that software  was already being built. 
Complexity is the enemy of security, and Factom is very complicated for the value it delivers. I'd like to see a concise explanation of the different components. Devising a new concensus algorithm doesn't sound like a great idea in this context. Anyway, all I'm saying is that we need to be more skeptical of these types of products.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:43:57
I'm all for market pressure, but I do think raising the capacity of the network over time is a logical extension of the protocol. Its like saying that we should keep users on dialup so that the system will become more efficient, but at a certain point no matter how efficient the secondary markets are the primary carrier needs to increase in capacity. I think giving us breathing room as other technologies are developed is just a smart move. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:51:12
That might be true. Right now there isn't any fully open source open assets platform, and certainly not anything with the capabilities that my platform has. Open source can be difficult for companies launching new products. There is a desire to get as much out there as possible to garner trust, but there are big fish in the water and hundreds of thousands of dollars in development at stake. Putting everyone else on an equal footing when you are trying to get a company off the ground might not be a great idea either.
This is why when you look at the Bitcoin dev landscape vast amounts of tools and services are API driven with the code completely obscured on the backend. Many of those services have substantial funding, Chain, Blockcypher, Gem.co, Bitgo, etc. They play lip service to open source by releasing front end tools that heavily leverage their closed back ends.
Edit: On further thought, I'm having trouble even thinking of any bitcoin firms that have a strong open source record. Bitpay, and the Conformal come to mind, but besides that its a wasteland. The biggest companies in the space from a VC perspective have released almost nothing.

Advertising costs money. Who will pay for it? Bitpay tried with the bitcoin bowl and realized fast that it was unsustainable. The scope of the problem is huge.
I would say that the best form of advertising is word of mouth and utility. If bitcoin generally becomes accessible and useful then people will gain interest. Right now there isn't a killer app in bitcoin, although we are seeing glimmers in remittances and other financial services.
To a similar extent we had the same problem with the early internet. It's hard to effectively advertise decentralized systems with so many stake holders. It happened through utility, and the accessibility of the web.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:22:05
Good engineering sticks out.  The other protocols are comparably very complicated. Although, I would say open assets itself is deceptively simple.
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:33:55
Yes. It remains to be seen. The network is worth about 7 billion dollars, that means change is slow. I agree that we need a more diverse ecosystem, but it doesn't happen over night, and no software is bug free. Btcd is a good contender though, good code quality, test coverage, etc. There are of course control reasons also, I don't imagine most of the Bitcoin devs want to cede that  to an alternate implementation they have nothing to do with.
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:30:21

I think an Ada version of bitcoin would be amazing, but the problem with bitcoin is just that it has the kitchen sink mentality. All of the consensus code should be pulled into the smallest library possible, with block handling, storage, wallets, RPC all being modular components off of it. I know the developers talk about this as something they want to move towards, but its actually the most important thing they could do. It would dramatically open up the network to third parties, and give everybody a really solid seed to work from. I would guess that moving to Ada might not even be possible from the current C++ codebase without breaking consensus.
Also, I'd like to throw my hat in the ring for Erlang. It doesn't have quite the guarantees that Ada has, but it does have some very good support for high availability operations.

Well right now its experimental. If the site goes down it doesn't stop donations as those are accumulated on the blockchain, but it would prevent new bounties or claims from happening while it was down. Ultimately it would probably use a multi-sig solution to further protect the bounties.

Well.... XCP is used for issuing and some other functionality like betting, but I like the idea of being able to issue assets for free. You say that $2 isn't a barrier, but when we talk about widespread tokenization it very well could be. Colored coin has all of Bitcoin's functionality with respect to multisig etc, and also supports atomic swaps which is the most widely used type of contract and the basis of distributed exchange. I also think more complicated contracts are going to be done by software agents, distributed or otherwise,which is a problem domain outside of asset issuance.  I think my problem with XCP and Mastercoin is the kitchen sink approach. A solid assets system with widespread exchange integration is all we need and we don't need to have an intermediary currency to do it.

Postponing is good enough. We need to create runway in order to solve this, if transaction volume goes up even ten times we are in serious trouble without something in place.

@_date: 2015-05-10 16:09:53
Lots of blocks result in lots of orphans when the block time is short. This in turn leads to longer reorganizations, more split competing chains, and more cpu usage. Finally it does little for confirmation time, instead of six blocks you might want to wait for 12 when the block time is halved. This produces a lot of network pressure and increased instability. Of the alternatives a larger block seems more reasonable. Also as mentioned spv clients end up storing proportionally more data in the form of block headers that aren't applicable to them.

I am really confused by these numbers. It takes less than a day for me to fully index the blockchain in its current state on one low end laptop with an old ssd and total disk usage at 50 gigabytes. Everyone posting your type of numbers is just throwing everything into a backend database and blowing out the data as much as possible. Since you can trivially horizontally scale tx indexing, I think this is a non issue.

This always annoyed me. What we need is a qr extension that defines the currency and a link to an Oracle that does the conversion. So a standard wallet could request conversion with a known api. 
Another way would be to subscribe to an Oracle that publishes price quotes to the blockchain. You could listen spv to updates which is more privacy conscious then requesting from a third party wallet api or service.

So, if I understand correctly the physical ownership is still determined by whoever holds the token. So a copy might be made of the digital file, but if the token representing that file can't be produced than it isn't a legal owner. The only reason to hash each file multiple times is to be able to say where the leak came from if the digital version is copied. Otherwise you really just want to track ownership or licensing rights, the unique hash per file is interesting but I think has limited utility. Would anyone like to clarify some additional use cases for unique hashing, I'm genuinely curious.

I think its a good idea. When we talk about colored coins what we are really extending is the idea of digital ownership, and the ability to transfer that ownership to other people. So gift cards, tickets, coupons, and other low cost items are a big deal. There is a lot of interesting stuff that can be done in that space.
As far as I know I'm the only one with an enterprise grade platform specifically designed as a gateway service for the network. There are other people working on cloud based apis for certain functionality, but this is a complete approach to tokenization management in a way that can be either cloud hosted or bundled into a gateway appliance so that institutions and others with more stringent requirements can control everything.

This is false. Its just fundamentally incorrect. The price of the side chain is priced by a person making the side chain, its deterministic. The market does not price the side chain, it prices the Bitcoin. I can make two side chains that are identical in functionality, and security, and give them two entirely different prices.
I believe in the purity of a bitcoin only system. Side chains is going to create a fragmented ecosystem of feature-sets controlled by different entities. What do you think the business plan is?  It doesn't fundamentally improve the utility or value of bitcoin unless the hash power is equivalent which won't be the case for the vast majority of side chains. The whole thing is a sleight of hand, savvy economists need to take a hard look at the structure that side chains imposes, its not all roses as you make it out to be.

Its not. I think we should start calling them alt coins with 2 way pegging. Its just less confusing. Side chains don't get any of the security benefits of Bitcoin by default, but impose an arbitrary 2-way value that does not represent real value. Nobody has addressed this in a meaningful way.

Ultimately we see that open assets has taken off because a working open standard was released, and people have been ramping up production environments of varying sorts with it. The chroma wallet platform has been in development for a very long time, I really think its time to stop attacking the competition and delivering a flexible open ecosystem using your solution. The market is quickly deciding that for most purposes open assets makes more sense, you can refute that if you want, but I would focus on delivering viable alternatives. 
The nice thing about the Bitcoin network is that they can both coexist.

It has the same parameters as normal blockchain usage. Open assets transaction tend to be for very small quantities of bitcoin, but are still subject to the same fee rules. If we don't increase the number of transactions that are possible on the network these types of applications become more expensive and perhaps not feasible.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:07:28
I'm talking from the perspective of the normal coinbase service. Have they described what happens to normal order flow from people who don't want to actively trade but just want to buy/sell via the existing coinbase interface? Does it simply enter it as a market order and try to get best price execution or does Coinbase take a fixed cut, and then peddle it to their own market? I imagine that coinbase has internally been set up with an exchange for a while, its the smart way to run an operation that constantly trades in and out even internally.

Who cares if its bare metal or not? It conveys speed/latency benefits which aren't really relevant in Bitstamp's case, otherwise the virtual instances are just as good if not better from a management and deployment perspective. The statement kind of implies some association with amazon beyond a simple hosting arrangement which is open to anyone with a few bucks and the time. Tens of thousands of start ups use AWS for hosting infrastructure, but I can't name a single real financial exchange that would come close to them. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:05:20
I'm not deflecting anything, I just feel that arguing these points is moot. Nobody pro side-chain has addressed the fundamental economics in any meaningful way.
I said the value added is not priced by the market. Which means you can't know what the value is. Its called price discovery, look it up. So whatever features you are allegedly getting are arbitrarily priced by the creator of the side chain, and the amount you paid is enforced by the fee rules which don't have to be fair.


They will if they want to get a return on moneys risked in an alt-coin. Remember side chains have risk also, they just aren't priced in. If the chain collapses you lose your bitcoin, you said it yourself. Maybe you want feature set X but you don't want to over pay for it, then you would want to use an alt coin. If it has the same merged mine characteristics its equivalent without the peg price.


The total crypto coin supply is arbitrary. It doesn't inflate the supply of bitcoin to use an alt coin that isn't bitcoin. It also doesn't steal value from bitcoin to trade it out for an alt coin, its a closed system.


Maybe, you can't determine the risk without accurate pricing. Its hidden information.


Side chains do not provide security that merged mined alt coins do not, they are merged mine alt coins.
Price volatility is a function of utility and speculation. The price won't be volatile on a side chain but it won't reflect reality either, its a fake price. 
P2P interop? That isn't guaranteed, there is a loose coupling for the purpose of transferring value.


The digital scarcity argument is weak to begin with, remember that Bitcoin can be subdivided substantially already, if the rules allows it to be subdivided further in the future we don't have perfectly enforced digital scarcity.

I would say its highly unlikely that they don't have a rough idea of how they were compromised at the very least, and rebuilding an infrastructure fast isn't a big deal. 100 hours isn't exactly fast, an exchange should be able to rebuild very very quickly.
That being said, the second point is a real cause of concern. The problem is not the breach but that there may be a wide variety of security concerns that aren't being addressed and other vectors of attack. They most certainly have not had time to do a thorough audit, nor make the kind of changes necessary to really secure their systems. 
The Bitgo move is some excellent PR, and does increase their operational security, but without knowing exactly how its implemented, and what their procedures are its difficult to know how this changes their security posture.

It is not misleading. Its different in every way. You can't answer my straight forward question.
I create a side chain called Bitcoin 2 which is a fork of Bitcoin 1.
It has a conversion ratio of 1 to 1, deterministic side chain.
Bitcoin 2 has 1/100th the hashing power of Bitcoin.
How is 1 "Bitcoin 2" worth 1 Bitcoin according to market forces? Notice I used the word WORTH not Price. Its priced equivalent, but is not the same.
Simple question, simple answer right? I'll be perfectly willing to concede the point if you can succinctly explain that.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:20:20
The reason the cost is 4% is not infrastructure. They can drive down the cost to be cost-comparative with bitcoin if they feel that their market is under competitive pressure. Right now the bitcoin ecosystem is too small for that to be an issue. Really large remittances companies are doing bulk transfer of monies, and transfer is almost instantaneous because they hold float in both countries to cover their average daily remit. That means instant transfer, and tight spread, they won't disappear without a fight, but in the end it will result in better prices for all regardless of the remittance channel used.

So looking at the 2013-03-11 event we had a hard fork, but that was reversed by downgrading some of the pools and updating the client. A lot of it has to do with block depth during a reorganization. If organizations confirm transactions at deeper block depths they minimize the impact of a reorganization or consensus bug adversely affecting them. I think as a business you should handle this the way it would traditionally be done, by taking out an insurance policy to cover yourself in the event the reorganization causes losses due to double spend or network outage. I think a renewed focus on bitcoin core as a cross platform consensus and communication library would increase stability by virtue of the fact of having a smaller more concise code base and associated tests.

There is no other way if your primary motivation is to avoid taxation. You are allowed to be a less than 50% owner in a foreign corporation, and not repatriate your monies or pay taxation on income that is not repatriated, but that is another issue. I am of the opinion that being a US citizen is something more important than one's tax situation, and that if you are in a position to worry about your taxation rate (because you are making bank) that you have the means to push for meaningful reform. Taking pot shots at the government while you are completely outside of the system is a guarantee that nothing will change.
Even if you are on the radical end of the spectrum and believe revolution is necessary, that doesn't happen while you are sitting in St. Kitts. Similarly even modest reform is difficult when your participation in US politics and life is hampered by your ability to get into the country. I'm neither terribly young nor filled with hope, but I don't think there is a single example that running away solves problems.

The average equity trade costs 1 cent, and less on volume discounts that dumb flow providers like Etrade get. I think at $7.99 a trade, Etrade has a nice fat margin to work within.

Its not very realistic. Its based on this idea that the Bitcoin network will be used to transfer increasing amounts of value directly, and that a large portion of consumers will start holding bitcoin and using it directly. That isn't how I think it will play out at all. I see the utility of the network growing, but not in a way that should so dramatically increase the value of the underlying. These things can play out different ways though, if we see a dramatic influx of users and demand skyrockets then the $1000 bitcoin becomes a possibility. I don't think this is directly correlated with transactions though, so transactional volume and throughput isn't the best indicator of a growing user base.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:04:30
They are amateurs. Everyone and their brother went out and started a bitcoin exchange, and almost none of them have any experience building exchanges, securing infrastructure, or cryptography of any kind. This is why we are going to see regulation in the space, and why I expect that ultimately major players will step in like the chicago mercantile or other regulated US and foreign exchanges.
Those exchanges will be augmented by increasing numbers of slower but more secure distributed solutions that allow peer to peer trading and reconciliation. 
I don't think Bitstamp should have much of a future, they were making bank, and yet didn't spend the necessary resources to secure their network or monies. Its surprising just how many people get this wrong, hire people who know what they are doing please.

Sure, as I said. The keys aren't simply lost, either its a hack or a major system flaw.
A well designed system would be virtually immune to that type of injection, using 2of2 multisig as an example, or any number of other ways to lock it down whereby the thing generating keys is buried deep in the back end. When I see these types of issues the credibility of the place goes down fast. I think if you have money at Bitstamp its time to move it somewhere else until they go through some verified independent security and reserve audits.

Something like this will probably get implemented in Storj eventually. It is hard to model directly on bittorrent unfortunately, and isn't a terribly easy distributed problem to solve.

Who determines the deterministic peg between bitcoin and the SC and how is it determined?


Except that gold certificates are not gold. The value of the certificate is a function of the credibility of the backer. A gold certificate could be sold at a large discount if the backer was not credible. You say the peg provides credibility, but have admitted that the side chain could fail. If a side chain is experimental it should trade at a discount, if a side chain has lower hashing power and equivalent features it should trade at a discount, if a side chain is better it should trade at a premium.

I think this would be an interesting tool from a user accountability perspective. The problem with exchanges doesn't have a simple solution, the players are not terribly sophisticated, most have never built a real exchange before, lack of legal accountability for auditing and other errors.

@_date: 2015-01-05 16:48:30
This just isn't the case. The exchange should have both keys in their key store, but only one in each of their separate signing machines. The address provided to the user is the p2sh hash which can be validated client side with the published public key of their backend, and the public key provided to the user a long with the address.
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:04:17
I disagree. The attack surface for Target is absolutely huge, and they have built their payment systems on something that is fundamentally insecure (Credit cards).
Bitstamp is a Bitcoin company. Much smaller attack surface, and with a technology that has a lot of security baked into it. There just isn't any reason to see a hot wallet hack like this. It is a clear signal that they didn't prioritize security, and should raise red flags for people looking to invest or do business with them.

I really don't understand what they are doing. Why would you ever build an exchange platform from scratch, when you have millions to purchase established infrastructure? I think as an investor I would rather see a real vetted platform than something cooked up in less than six months. Even if it was run by a team of ex-hedge fund people.
Having built real operating financial exchanges before, I know how much work is involved. If they are trying to avoid the mistakes of Mt. Gox, et al, they should be licensing all of the exchange technology and partnering for all of the  security and compliance. We don't need another half-baked attempt, regulated or not.

Lets do the opposite case.

The reason people aren't terribly concerned with 51% attacks from major minors is that it is like killing the golden goose. These guys are raking in money by running the network, and any demonstrated major attack on the network would substantially decrease the utility value of that protection. The price would plummet.

Well, after the fact it is of course much more difficult. I would rather see effort spent on that then on adding features to any of those sub components.

There are probably some freenet market places also, and being a closed network with no routing to the normal web is in a position to be more secure. Although again, who knows.

I'm stating that is what happens now. Buyers and sellers are matched internally for Bitcoin, and payments are processed internally between parties. Its all shuffled around their internal database.

The more control is centralized within Coinbase, the less bitcoin actually traverses the network as a larger percentage of orders are internally routed.

Owning the hardware has little to do with whether the NSA has access to it. They can simply be ordered to give it over, or the government could seize it. As a legally operating entity they have little choice but to comply with both US and UK laws that govern these things.

Well what if someone forks Bitcoin directly, allows 1 to 1 transfer, but create a different fee structure? One that incentivizes users to switch to it, but doesn't properly incentivize miners. So it looks and acts the same, but the hashing security isn't there. Conversely what if the miners collude to create an alternative network with higher fees?
What if your utility bills can only be paid on a utility company run blockchain? What if you bank transfers can only happen on a certified blockchain?
I feel like there are a lot of unexplored possibilities, which is both exciting but potentially destabilizing. A two way peg is a means of migrating Bitcoin onto other networks, which increases the utility of Bitcoin but also by definition fragments usage.
I think that fair pricing is important on fragmented networks, which is something that a deterministic peg thwarts. It just seems more complicated to me than a simple panacea for scale concerns.

There is bias, its not completely objective. To be fair Shrem and Ver might have committed crimes against the government, but they didn't rip off bitcoin holders. At least, insofar as we know.

Custody of funds is a good point, that does change things somewhat. I guess my point was that the risk engine field has been a round a while, and I would imagine a lot of the patents are vague about the specific technologies or transports involved. I.e, a method to secure a third party transaction via an external risk engine" etc.  So it seems like that might be a difficult patent to get or defend. I am not a lawyer. :)
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:27:40
Yes, thats right. The assertion I am making is that market pricing matters because it conveys real information about relative value. When the price can't fall or rise you are making a statement about value equivalency that is false by definition. A side chain with a pegged 1 to 1 rate may not actually be worth 1 bitcoin, for various reasons including hash power, user adoption, sketchy code, whatever. Without price discovery there is no way to price its real value. You aren't getting a bitcoin-equivalent service but you are transferring bitcoin to it. In the worst case you simply lose coins, but that would be pretty bad for a monetary system.
My example was a bitcoin clone with much lower floating fees that is pegged 1 to 1 as a side chain. That creates a User incentive to migrate coins to it even though from a hashing perspective it might be less secure because miners are less likely to adopt it. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:31:52
I think micropayment channels are neat, certainly for pay-as-you-go services, but I'm not sure that is the killer app for them.

@_date: 2015-01-30 17:20:08
I love the idea, but ultimately they are just the man in the middle. They take your coins, trade them on an exchange and give you the digital currency you request.

I think we are making the assumption of qualified security people vetting infrastructure and code decisions. All other things being equal a competent team can build something more secure than AWS.

*Reports may be published every six months, however, reporting on national security orders issued against data collected by new company products and services must be delayed two years.*

That is a matter of opinion. I don't think the best engineers go work for amazon, the pay isn't great, and its supposed to be fairly unpleasant. I don't think their skills trump any vulnerability.
That just isn't the case. I'm sorry you have had experiences like that, mine have been different. There are a lot of factors at play that make AWS a good option for certain companies in certain situations. There are also design decisions that make it a poor choice, certain fields have more stringent latency and processing requirements than what can generally be provided by AWS. AWS is a fantastic toolset, I have met more than my share of people who have no idea how to create truly redundant or resilient architecture on AWS or anywhere else for that matter. Shoving a bunch of instances in an availability zone, or even multiple availability zones does little to increase those metrics without careful design decisions. It's not a panacea for scale or up time.
The only space where AWS has real economy of scale and passes that on to consumers is in storage. S3 is hard to beat for reliability and scale. If you look at raw processing power of hardware solutions you have to compare to completely dedicated instances, and even then its not apples to apples.
My problem with this thread is that cloud proponents are presenting it as a perfectly acceptable solution to run an exchange on. Except, there isn't a single real world, equities, bonds, commodities, coffee, whatever, that runs on AWS. Why is that? Its because for large exchange problems AWS is simply not sufficient in any way. For those who point at Nasdaq lets be clear, they use AWS for data warehousing and access, not for exchange functionality.
Similarly, Bitstamp migrated from some kind of hosted solution into AWS, that doesn't bode well for the ground up types of decisions that need to be made to get the benefits of AWS resiliency and security. I think the point is moot, because I think this type of breach tells you everything you need to know about Bitstamp, with the monies they have and the investor interest they should have hired people who could secure their funds and approached this problem from the ground up. Being on AWS doesn't magically convey benefits that hosted solutions do not at first tier data centers.

Except that in order to initiate the withdrawal the transaction has to be initiated from Bitstamp's side. So theoretically someone could hijack that same process to withdraw to their own addresses if they got control of the Bitstamp backend. Still, better than before, probably. Its a harder hack at least.

I'm not sure why this is surprising. A lot of people renounce their citizenship and expect to get the same treatment they got when they were citizens. It just doesn't work that way, why should it? The US doesn't owe anybody entry, certainly someone who has renounced their citizenship, has a felony record, and may be doing the whole thing for tax evasion purposes. Whats the problem? A far more likely explanation is that for various reasons he didn't meet the criteria for entry and was simply summarily denied, he is small fry to the US government, do you think the powers that be honestly care one way or the other?

A hot wallet is simply the addresses under the control of an entity for which it has the private keys immediately available for moving funds. So a percentage of the total amount of bitcoin is held in addresses that can be moved easily, and a percentage in cold storage that requires more effort (loading the keys, etc). When you request a withdrawal they go to the hot wallet to send you the funds if they are available, otherwise they go the slow path and load more funds into the hot wallet then process the withdrawal. The idea is to improve security through an "air gap" such that all of the funds cannot be access directly.

I think the bigger issue is that Bitpay doesn't have a long term business model. Even assuming that Bitcoin adoption grows, transfer of Bitcoin to fiat is a programmable function.

So you are giving up 1% of your take home wage in order to have bitcoin instead of USD, plus whatever the volatility risk on bitcoin is?

Why don't you just accept the monies normally, either directly into an exchange bank account, or into your own account, and then handle the trading yourself? You are paying what is equivalent to an ATM fee for every dollar you make.

No, the context matters here. The statement is:
"private keys of your deposit address may be lost"
I'm saying that isn't possible in a well built system. Now the hot wallet may be compromised and funds could be stolen from it after the fact, because the keys for a hot wallet are accessible to the system in some way, but that is a wholly different type of compromise.
So either the system isn't built right, or the stated reason isn't true.

Many countries have double taxation treaties and taxation doesn't occur until after the first 100k of income at least. So for most people it doesn't make a lot of sense, unless you have a huge income outside of the US. The way it chafes us citizens is that they have a huge income originating in the United States, want to live abroad in a different tax jurisdiction and don't think they should be taxed by the US for that income. Yeah it sucks, but thats the way it is. Again, in that situation renouncing US citizenship might not make sense either do to exit tax, liquidation etc.

Yes, there is something as secure as Bitcoin by default, its called Bitcoin.
The 2 way peg is arbitrary, its a set deterministic value that isn't based on price discovery. Think about it this way, just because I say a sidechain is worth 1 bitcoin per coin, doesn't mean that it is. Right? You said it yourself, nothing is secure by default, so its security is a relative feature based on the total merged hashing power. If that hashing power increases then all other things being equal the coin should be worth more, or if the hashing power decreases the relative value should be worth less. Neither can happen in a 2 way peg.
So its a false assertion of value to deterministically peg two crypto assets that aren't identical, which means users are either over paying for functionality, or under paying for it, and in the worst case are not getting accurate information about their relative value.  Side chains are technically interesting but largely ignore established market theory, the same theory of careful balances on which Bitcoin itself has prospered. I've said it before but it provides a perfect mechanism to migrate away from Bitcoin as we know it in favor of something else, or creates a system of highways and provincial roads controlled by third parties but provides little value over alt coins. Remember side chains are just merged mined alt-coins with an arbitrary deterministic peg that cannot change with respect to demand, and even though the conversion rate is fixed the fees for usage are determined by the side chain's code.

This is a neat idea, but unless you can figure out a way to make it generic enough where anybody can add a captive portal as a revenue stream its a difficult proposition. Whats the total market opportunity for something like this? Who are your primary customers? Why not accept traditional payment channels?
You almost certainly have to ship a device of some sort to act as the captive portal and/or provide a firmware implementation built on WRT that people can flash themselves. Of the customers who deploy this, how many will generate revenue via BTC? There are already commercial captive portal systems that are in use at hotels and other public venues, are these your competitors, or would you simply do BTC integration with their existing products?
I think you are on the right track, but this isn't a VC funded idea. Its something you may raise 10-20k to do on lighthouse, but it has serious problems at scale.
Your thinking about payment channels as a service, multi-sig security, etc probably have broader appeal. My feeling with all of these things, is that if you are going to devote your considerable time and talents to something you should pursue something with a massive market opportunity and upside. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:35:36
This makes sense. So the funds are just getting locked up and requiring participation from both in order to spend them. So from a micropayment perspective this only makes sense if many organizations use a single micro-payment provider that is doing this?

I don't understand your comparison... The thing is the gold express and shib express companies aren't transporting bitcoin. They are changing out your bitcoin for something else as an intermediary, and providing different levels of service.
Lets take your analogy further,
I have two logistics companies
Gold express - Transfers 1 gold bar for 1 gold bar
BestNetworkEver Express - Transfers 1 gold bar for 1 gold bar
Gold express is the best network ever built.
BestNetworkEver express is a pretty crap network that doesn't work that well.

I think you missed what I was saying. Programmable function, as in the end-to-end delivery of cash can be completely automated to and from BTC, without the need for an intermediary.

The compute isn't equivalent though. Most 1U servers will absolutely thrash a whole mess of EC2 instances, even medium and large instances don't compare. That gets you into reserved instances, which is a whole other problem set. AWS isn't a panacea for uptime or scale concerns, its very hard to get right.

I don't know if that is true. My whole point is that Bitcoin is based on many very carefully balanced economic incentives. I feel like the two-way peg system could disrupt those incentives, and actually increase the fragility of the network in unexpected ways.  I think we would be better served scaling up before we scale out, until we have a much better grasp of what the economics of side chains does to Bitcoin's core incentive structure.
The toll road scenario is also a very possible danger. If we see fragmentation of network functionality and allow corporate versions of the blockchain to connect directly with Bitcoin we may scale the network but introduce some undesirable side effects. Blockstream's business plan revolves around company blockchain technologies and in fact can support systems completely decoupled from the security of the bitcoin network.  I think if we imagine what those systems might look like, and how they would be offered we can think about it as on-ramps into proprietary networks with different fee structures. I don't think thats the vision that most bitcoin users embrace when they think about open financial systems.

We are increasingly adding broadband capacity all over the world, and even today most bitcoin users aren't running full nodes even though its well within their tolerances to do so. We are going to have to continue to rely on SPV, off chain and future payment channel and hub and spoke networks.
A much bigger problem is memory pressure, and dealing with tons of unconfirmed transactions flooding the network. We average several thousand unconfirmed at any given time already, what happens when that is 100,000 ?

This is false in every way. My point is exactly this, if you have the money you should purchase an established exchange platform, and then build the clearing / BTC components on top of it. Building good software takes time, OMX has had trillions of trades run through it across the world and has been in continuous development for ten years. There is simply no comparison to home grown software in less than a year. The point is if you want to handle something at wall street standards, use software built for and by wall street.

Is there any indication that this knock off is actually hurting business? It seems to me that people who buy Trezor are extremely security conscious, buying an unvetted third party platform and pushing official code onto it does not seem like the best idea. 
There is nothing that prevents them from relicensing their own source code if they have dual license agreements with contributors and don't include third party code that taints the code base. They should simply change the licensing, don't back date it. 
Licensing is an extremely tricky proposition. If someone has spent months, or years writing code there is a real tangible cost to them, but there are strong benefits to engaging the community. I think dual licensed gplv3 is probably the best overall in terms of protecting right to use source code, and stopping other commercial entities from bundling your code with their product without releasing the changes. All of the MS licenses are really suspect, certainly this one doesn't really qualify in any way as open source.

I know my sarcasm meter is completely messed up, but it couldn't be more clear that this is a scam. Its completely unrealistically structured, and the coin has no value whatsoever. No merchant adoption, poor security, and based on the completely unrealistic hope that the price could be propped up. Right now at $4 a coin its trading $4 over value. 
The thing is, even though its a complete scam its probably not illegal in any way. There is nothing that says you can't pump and dump an alt coin, its a completely unregulated instrument. You don't have to hide in the shadows, just come out and push it like crazy through every avenue you have because there are no repercussions. Since the coin is 97% pre-mined you can just sell it into the market at whatever you can get and walk about with millions.

The SC maker doesn't arbitrarily define the price, but they set it? You and I have different definitions of arbitrary. If someone sets the price, it by definition isn't set by the market. I'm not sure how you can argue otherwise.


Except, you just said that the price was set by the SC maker? So the value is a function of the SC makers peg. What you meant to say was that the total number of coins or market capitalization lends credibility to the chain. That is a different statement.


Since they happen all of the time, please give me an example of a two way peg in the market where the value of each is not ultimately priced by the market. Even two-way currency pegging requires substantial amounts of capital injection to maintain the peg. I don't think you can find an example of a two way peg that is absolute.

No it isn't, because building it is a function of time. They could spend 5 years on it and not have as robust a platform as they could license from day 1.

I think getting a single library to work reliably and the same across platforms is possible. There are numerous examples that work just fine today. If we were to shrink the code base into the critical consensus parts and test it like crazy across platforms it would be fine. Linux does this right now, glibc, and a ton of other cross platform libraries. I think that would result in less forks than a diversified ecosystem of clients all running slightly different consensus code. Having a meta consensus layer I think makes the problem even harder to deal with, and may have unexpected consequences with respect to latency / mining rewards.

You can also validate that the deposit address given to the user is a two-of-two that the exchange controls by publishing the public key of the backend, and the public key given out to the user. Which if given through disparate channels could secure the front end from man-in-the-middle style address distribution.

You just rent from them, it doesn't cost as much as a security breach.


This depends entirely on the business you are in. I would say if either security of performance are the most important things to you than owning your own hardware is something that should be considered. AWS is a nice compromise but it isn't a panacea for bad architecture, poor systems design, or sloppy programming.

This is one possible approach, another would be to rethink what bitcoin core development is. It suffers from the kitchen sink mentality, where the same code base is handling concensus code, and a gui wallet, and an rpc mechanism and a bunch of unnecessary fluff. The bitcoin core code needs to be like the Linux kernel with the eco system revolving around a userland that uses a defined protocol library to interact with it. This would allow alternative implementations to utilize the same concensus code, but differentiate in terms of functionality, rpc mechanisms, integration, etc. Similar to what we see with libtorrent. 
I really like btcd, I think its a great implementation, but consensus code is very tricky, and I think we should focus on a single minimalist core with third party language integration, and fan out all of the other services into separate projects.

Yeah I understand that, so you end up with an arbitrary number of signed inputs ready to be submitted to the network which you aggregate to save fees. Nothing is stopping someone from double spending the unspent in question prior to you submitting the aggregate transaction. Correct?

I have extensive experience with physical data centers, physical machines, virtual instances, financial exchanges, and AWS.
There isn't a single "real world" exchange that runs on AWS. Primarily the type of processing exchanges do tends to run better on physical hardware.  It is also important to have very fine grained control over the proximity of your components, the networking that attaches them, and the messaging rates and bursting that happens between them. These are things that AWS doesn't do particularly well. Bitstamp is very low volume compared to established financial exchanges, and their processing and latency requirements are not nearly as strenuous.
So to answer the questions directly.


AWS does have rigorous virtual and physical auditing procedures in place, this is especially so for regions that are certified for use by the government (GovCloud). There needs to be a lot of accountability in place in order to operate shared hosting environments at this scale. $5m on the scale of things isn't very much money, there are certainly infrastructures with more value on AWS (although in contrast to Bitcoin this is illiquid value, intellectual property, personal data, etc).  That being said nothing is fool-proof, physical access tends to trump many security best practices. AWS practices in this regard are not terribly transparent, and if security was my number one concern I would be hard pressed to choose their normal cloud offering. 


Auditing tends to stop this type of thing, its certainly possible to know when certain events occur. Again, nothing is fool proof, there are gaps which is why you need to build higher level security (multi-sig etc) into operations.


Then they raid the particular customer and take all of the virtual server information, and possibly the physical servers themselves. Amazon is a US company and complies with us regulation.


If you know what you are doing you can build highly resilient and secure systems on AWS. I think Bitstamp has proven that they don't know what they are doing, so it stands to reason that introducing the complexity of AWS without engineering more rigorous solutions doesn't necessarily increase your overall security. Engineering large scale redundant, fault tolerant solutions is difficult, even on AWS, and they ostensibly provide you with the necessary tools.


Tens of thousands of startups run on AWS. I do think there are reasons why an exchange should seriously consider controlling their own infrastructure entirely, but that requires a level of expertise that they may not have.

I think that breaking deterministic wallets is not desirable, and that it's overly complicated for the mid term. As another poster said we have a mechanism for coalescing unspents in the form of input selection which is entirely compatible with what we have now. Building responsible wallets that do that would help. Obviously not as much as multiple output coalescing.
Again the issue is ram usage, I think we can address that independently by preventing access to disk as much as possible for transactions that have yet to enter the mempool. We already give preferential fees to old inputs that are rarely referred to in ram, maybe we should charge more for inputs that are indexed to represent the increased cost of using them. Maybe an opcode to guarantee an input won't be used until a point in the future would result in lower fees as a result, I.e ckecklocktime.
There's lots of less complicated ways to reduce memory pressure on the system.

@_date: 2015-01-12 03:52:01
I'm not arguing about the value of the BTC, I'm arguing that the side chain has a false value, that doesn't fluctuate with its utility. If I were to create an alt coin with hashing power less than btc but give it a 1 to 1 peg, the price would not reflect the reality of its value. Since we use price to determine the relative merits of things its strange to have price fixing across digital currency networks that are not the same. I think this has unintended market side effects.

This is not true. I don't know why you keep pushing it. If I make  a side chain, I specify the conversion rate to and from the side chain. Regardless of the hashing power of the chain. So theoretically I could price it 1 to 1, but that wouldn't reflect equivalence.
So lets make two chains
Side Chain A is 1 bitcoin to 1 Sidecoin A
Side Chain B is 1 bitcoin to 1 Sidecoin B
Sidecoin B has half the hashing power of Sidecoin A and an equivalent feature set. How is Sidecoin B's price determined by the market as you state?

I don't think that is the case... how can that be true? If the unspent isn't invalidated by the network because it is part of a transaction that gets propagated and included into a block then it could be used as part of another transaction.  I'm not sure if it matters, in that for most cases it would make more sense to just pay the micro transaction rather than the fees required to double spend it.

This type of thinking that the market will simply provide is dangerous, right now there is no viable lightening network, no viable payment channels or large scale hub and spoke and we can expect transaction volume to really explode in the coming year. We have to deal with the reality we have, and systematically address the problem. There isn't a silver bullet, and increasing the block size is one of the more obvious short term paths while we explore other avenues.

There are a lot of issues putting downward pressure on the price, it has little to do with Bitcoin. Many would rather hold dollars if the relative value is increasing. A stronger dollar, should result in cheaper bitcoin, and recent dumping from scams (I'm looking at you Paycoin) are also adversely affecting the value. Long term prospects are really good though, this coming year is when the utility of the network is going to dramatically increase. More assets transfer, more remittances, I think we are going to have a good year after a rocky start. Price is going to bottom out a bit, but if the value of the network increases we should see a nice rebound.
I seriously doubt we will see prices in the $1200 range though, that was complete bubble territory.

I understand side chains, so my argument against them isn't primarily technical, its economic.
A two way peg is a statement of value. So for example, I am saying 1 bitcoin equals 1 ShibeCoin. This is true because I can always acquire 1 Shibacoin for 1 bitcoin, and relinquish 1 shibacoin for 1 bitcoin. This means that in any secondary market that exists the value will always gravitate towards the peg, i.e there is never any reason to buy higher or sell lower.
However, Shibacoin is not bitcoin, it may have a different feature set, it may not have the hashing power (may not be as secure) and it may not work, i.e in the worst case the code base is flawed and Bitcoin cannot be redeemed correctly. Price discovery helps us make decisions about the relative value and merits of a coin, but an artificial peg hides the relative value from the users. So there isn't a way of making an informed decision about its quality or value. In every way except value a side chain is equivalent to a merged mine alt-coin, except an alt-coin allows us to make informed decisions about relative value via price discovery. 
The argument that side chains allow us to do things without risking bitcoin is an illusion, because the relative risks and trade offs are hidden information that the market cannot price. My issue with side chains is that it ignores fundamental market theory in favor of the idea of deterministic equivalence which by definition is not possible.

If there are problem spaces where the Chromawallet protocol is simply better and makes more sense then explain them, compare and contrast if you want.

I think we pretty much agree. I just disagree that the decentralized exchange is the key to that. Rather very inexpensive token issuance is at its root, and the ability to spend and redeem them dynamically and with service providers of all kinds. In some ways the decentralized exchange is a distraction from that vision. The things you mention are not properties of a distributed exchange, only of token transfer.  Now with respect to control, there is an argument to be made there but the liquidity and rapidity of centralized exchanges along with their legal bindings to the real world are going  to keep them part of the ecosystem for a long time. They do more than simply swap assets in the financial system.

I remember it selling weapons, this was many years ago. Perhaps someone with more definitive information can chime in. The point I was trying to make wasn't simply a moral judgement on whether its ok to sell weapons, fake ids (for identity theft among other uses) and drugs. It was simply a statement that the government has multiple grounds under the law of the land to prosecute. When you talk jury nullification the pool of people who may choose to nullify shrinks with each progressive fact. The number of people ok with drugs, guns and identity theft is a smaller pool than those just anti-drug. 
Also, from a political perspective you don't have to look far to see that states that allow all of these things unfettered aren't states any more. Look at Somalia for the perfect example. Sooner or later the person with the most drugs and guns just takes control to the detriment of everyone else.

The peg is a false statement of value. If I say that something is worth 1 bitcoin it doesn't mean that it is.

I think this is an interesting idea. If you can prove control of an address, you can grant access based on that control. Similarly if you can accept payment you can trigger all sorts of real world events based on that payment. Finally, if a device can forward payment it can pay for additional resources it may need to do its job.
These are obviously contrived examples, but we trigger actions all of the time in the real world that require payment, like parking meters. A lot of the payments we do for government services are actually open records, so being able to audit them openly is interesting.
I built a device that did this a year and a half ago on startup bus that essentially did this, and I'm sure there are other people who have done the same thing. Its a logical extension of the network that you want to be able to have events trigger physical interactions. At the moment its a bit of a solution looking for a problem, but I think when you take it farther and think about devices provisioning resources based on those payments you enter a world that isn't possible with the current payment infrastructure.

No but the value of DHL and UPS is priced by market forces. It ebbs and flows by the the utility and level of service it provides. If DHL suddenly drops half its planes and doesn't use trucks anymore (i.e the hash rate halves), how can it be the same cost as UPS? More important as a consumer how can you know the difference? I think making deterministic statements of value over things that are inherently not equal does not make economic sense. I would rather scale the Bitcoin network normally, and add features on top of that network that increase its utility. Scaling it out horizontally with non-equivalent chains at fixed pricing seems dubious.

A good online resource for learning the language is [learnyousomeerlang]( Erlang/OTP is the official name, OTP is kind of like the standard library on which most erlang components and applications are built on. I think the language is about 30 years old? The open source release was in the late 90s.
Hot code loading just means that you can swap out the code running as its running. So lets say you are taking a telephone call, you could upgrade the code running the platform without restarting it or dropping the call.  So this feature combined with other aspects of the language make it good for fault tolerance. A bunch of companies use it in that capacity, like WhatsApp, Facebook Chat, Amazon, Heroku, Github, etc. Its the secret sauce in quite a few successful startups.

Well Erlang despite its reputation is not a terribly difficult language, although you do have to have an understanding of functional programming and recursion. The syntax leaves a lot to be desired, but immutability and pattern matching (which is incredible) are core to the framework. Like anything there is a learning curve, but I hope self contained examples like this will get people interested in the language.
Erlang is a really excellent language for distributed and fault tolerant applications, it can do hot code reloading of running processes as an example, and has lots of features around concurrency, restarting failed components, logging etc. I wrote my entire enterprise platform in Erlang, specifically because I wanted telecom level uptime and management for Bitcoin apps.

The available resources for Bitcoin programming definitely need improvement. We need some practical books on building applications that use the network, as well as very low level technical explorations of how the network works. Everything I know I've had to piece together from reading source code, with the occasional high level overview mixed in. 
I could write something like this if there was interest, but I do most of my development in Erlang, and that alone would be a major hurdle for people. If I was trying to be universally accessible then maybe ruby or python would be a better choice.

So we will continue to change the rules of the network to increase the divisibility of the coin over time to allow for more fine grained distribution? Maybe.

Right now if I want a miner to replace my transaction with another for a double spend I have to collude with them to do it. RBF creates a concensus mechanism for communicating my desire to potentially double spend to miners without direct collusion. Are you seriously arguing that there is no difference between those two cases? What problem is RBF solving again? Lets start there.

You are the one in the wrong. The Colu server does not implement Open assets, it implements its own private protocol that has nothing to do with open assets. It is a testament to the marketing of coloredcoins.org that you and many others are confused.

Also, his point about Chinese miners is spot on. The financial incentive is there for them to thwart expansion of the network. The counterbalance to that is developer changes in core that aren't happening.

The issue is that verification is an expensive operation if the index isn't in ram, but removing the index opens up an attack vector for resource consumption.
Can we front the entire utxo with a series of invertible bloom filters for checking presence?
If so then slow verification is less of an issue for false positive subset. A node can then tune it's index ram usage based on how quickly it can verify data on disk. The index itself being in ram becomes more of an optional scenario.
The ops idea is interesting but I think overly complicated.

I don't disagree. I just think there is a lot of added complexity that supports a set of features that aren't very useful in the grand scheme of things. I would prefer a simpler alternative that is potentially SPV capable. The nice thing about the blockchain is that all of these different systems will coexist for some time to come.

It sets up the local businesses with another revenue stream. The problem isn't the idea, its that its so easy to replicate. Many businesses are already trialing the exact same technology, and they will all canibalize each other. There is no overhead to running the network which would keep competitors out. Its great for consumers, but all of these businesses are a race to the bottom.

A side chain doesn't have any more security than an altcoin, but the transferred coins can't be arbitrarily stolen, the side chain could collapse though which would make them irretrievable.

I never said zero conf was safe, only that for practical purposes it is. Lets put it this way, if I get a zero conf, and I care about double spends I can check propagation to up my certainty of confirmation, or if the value is high enough wait for whatever number of confirmations I feel comfortable with.
If I get an RBF transaction it is unherently unsafe, regardless of whatever metrics I can derive from the network, until I get a confirmation.
Two different situations. I like adding code to things that genuinely solves problems. RBF is useful in the case where the transaction isn't getting confirmed, and I don't want to or can't do a child pays for parent transaction. A lot of those transactions are created by user error and bad wallet software. Let's fix the user experience.

As other people have alluded to, the random words you are talking about are bip-39 mnemonic codes. You can use these codes to generate the private key for each of the listed addresses. This won't give you access to bitcoin sitting in exchanges, barring a password recovery I would look into acquiring that bitcoin through legal channels. 
I would get a bip-39 compatible wallet, like breadwallet and try restoring those addresses. Hopefully this gets you access. After doing so speak with a lawyer and accountant, there are undoubtedly huge tax implications to selling that Bitcoin for local currency given its appreciation.

How does the network reach consensus? The blockchain helps secure events in time with proof of work. How does this secure the transactions from malicious actors on the network, or people who control more than 51%?  I like seeing people publish ideas like this because digital currency has a lot of room to improve, but at the same time Bitcoin does things the way it does for some very good reasons.

We just need clarification. This isn't a market maker gets to fill market order at any price they want which is what you are implying. Obviously. If I was on such a market I would always buy at 0.01 and sell at millions and nobody would participate. It's still an order book. Worst case is that someone places a limit not on the inside and gets a worse execution, but even that doesn't make sense.
I think this is probably modeled like forex markets in practice which just means that they get preferential treatment on the inside, and or preferential priority on posted liquidity, or the ability to cancel posted liquidity prior to execution. These are very common in forex markets. Any other scenario is a non functioning market, let's wait for clarification before everyone jumps to conclusions.

A lot of phones are shipping with what amounts to small processors that act independently of the main systems of the phone. These are called trusted security modules, and they let you do computations, and potentially have direct keyboard and screen access independent of the operating system running on the phone. The security implications are that you can store keys in these modules, do signing and other operations, and dramatically increase your security posture without relying on an external device.  Its a well known set of technologies that are relatively pervasive but with few applications. Several companies in the space are looking to license and release bitcoin integration tech.

Obviously because then every trade would logically execute at mininum quantity, or maximum allowed value.  Which logically makes no sense, and is definitely not the case.

The environment is far too toxic for rational technical debate,  and that predisposes that this is even a technical discussion anymore and not an ideological one. Its so easy to compromise on this point and move on, but instead we have a split community. The increased fees are already hurting certain use cases, I think the question should be who benefits if the network can't be used except as a digital store of value and an anchor for other networks, that is the crux of the whole "debate".

Double spends really aren't that easy to pull off successfully (where successful is defined as tricking a merchant). The vast majority of low cost transactions i.e where there is no miner collusion (which is unlikely unless there is a profit incentive) can be detected via node propagation.

I think extraordinary claims require evidence. There is enough here for anyone in the government to track him down if its a legit story, so why the secrecy and lack of detail?

maybe? Its just a solution searching for a problem, and has a host of user and other issues associated with it. For the most part if we had better more standardized mechanisms for fee calculation across wallets the main issue with stuck transactions would be largely eliminated. RBF when it is on by default, which is ultimately the goal will eliminate zeroconf as a viable mechanism for payment to most merchants.

No, because of bandwidth limitations in China, which are very real they stand to lose market share as the blocksize increases because their block propagation will be much slower on winning blocks. Its hard to quantify since they can always opt to artificially keep the block size smaller when they mine them. That may effectively limit the network while they have so much control.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:06:38
and it has the advantage of being a completely opaque protocol that nobody else has implemented so if they go out of business your currency will no longer work.

That might be a good thing. They are good guys, but their leadership isn't good. Too divisive, too much based on ideology rather than technicals.

I agree, but what is the threat vector here, consensus protects us from quite a bit in a scenario where the validation step is corrupted. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 03:09:56
Sort of. If one or many faulty nodes send bad data that I can't validate things keep on working fine. If the majority of nodes are compromised it would break the system because the consensus rules for the network are different. Anyway, a state level actor might be able to leverage cpu backdoors to cause all sorts of problems, we don't disagree there.
@_date: 2016-12-31 06:24:27
I really like the sentiment of this post, but I think it downplays the amount of creativity and ingenuity it takes to build something revolutionary, even if all of the foundational components are there. Its like saying, we already knew how to cut wood, and we understood how to pull things on a sleigh, so the wheel was just a little jump that anyone could have made. I could have done it had I bothered to think about it.
I do agree with the sentiment that effort is probably more important than any intrinsic skill or attribute though, so its a nice thing to think coming into the new year.
@_date: 2016-12-05 04:47:30
I'll just throw in my 2 cents here since I have extensive experience with open power based systems. I love the power processors, and the IBM hardware surrounding them, they are really incredible machines in pretty much every way. Their performance especially under tremendous load is exemplary.  If you are looking for the closest modern equivalent to a real unix workstation you can't do better than this.
That being said, the cost is really outside of what can reasonably be expected for the average consumer, over 7k for a functioning workstation is well into the professional market. It would be much less expensive to build a hardened bitcoin node on an open source hardware cpu, even one emulated on an fpga than to expect this type of hardware to gain traction outside of data centers and certain professional users.
I've wanted power hardware for my desktop for 10+ years, but the price/performance isn't there, and key handling/validation could potentially be done by an external device. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:43:23
I've moved over to XT also. I'm hoping the core devs can all just get along considering the excellent work they have done, but there seems to be an ideological divide and mainstream development has been hijacked.

Floats like this are rarely used in professional trading systems. Yes, they can be used correctly, but there are a lot more potential gotchas. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:58:45
I think the calculation is that it takes roughly 0.6 billion years to crack a single keypair in Bitcoin. With a thousand time speedup we are still looking at a million years. If we get another thousand speedup than a thousand years. Also remember that Bitcoin wallets are collections of many keypairs usually. Once you calculate the cost associated with doing the raw computation it just doesn't pan out no matter how you slice it. It's not economically or mathematically feasible. 
All of that goes out of the window if someone finds a short cut, but so far so good. :)

Maybe read this, 
In C/C++ and other system languages it can be a problem, which in most cases is easily avoided in trading systems by using large integer fixed point arithmetic. I've only been involved in high performance trading systems for 10+ years, I may have no clue what I'm talking about. While you are right that 64 bit extended precision float is going to represent all bitcoin values its not standard practice, and I wouldn't do it.

The annoying thing about dictators is that they are effective. More seriously I like opinionated software, this software-by-consensus is not a great mechanism. Bitcoin itself in its initial implementation was the work of one dedicated person, and a lot of good software starts that way. 
The Linux model of benevolent dictatorship has been extraordinarily effective, because ultimately the decision to merge or not is in the hands of a few people, all of whom report to the man on top. This idea that a few developers without really providing alternative code or strong fact-based evidence that changing the blocksize limit is a terrible thing can halt the entire process is ridiculous.
Anyone can fork bitcoin, and anyone can run whichever version they want. That is exactly the way it should be. I think to make this less contentious the fork should have only included the block size changes, but so be it.

You aren't paranoid, this is absolutely correct. It is simply an advertising vehicle for Colu now, and they have misappropriated the name to push their own product as the definitive color coin solution when anyone who knows anything about the space knows that it isn't.  
Also, the product itself is not open source in any way, nor is is inter-operable. When you release front end code under an open license that relies on a completely proprietary, poorly documented, and opaque back end that isn't an open source solution by definition. 
It's underhanded given the original goal of the page and the spirit of cooperation under which it was made.

Hackathons. Stealing dreams, one idea at a time. It's a great way to meet other motivated people, many of whom will be motivated to walk away with whatever they can get from you. The truth is there are very few idea people, but legions of people capable of stealing the good ones.  It's about the execution ultimately, the contacts, the connections, etc. There is no honor among thieves. If you have expectations as to idea secrecy and intellectual property, have something drawn up before you build it together. Most hackathons do a terrible job of promoting IP transparency and control, mostly because it completely sucks and kills the vibe.

This is using open assets. There isn't a correlation between number of shares and units of Bitcoin. They are decoupled. So anything over the dust limit can represent any number of shares per output or a combination of shares in a set of outputs.

It's a first step. The point is third party auditing/settlement accounting I would imagine.  Even if they don't control the keys they can take steps to limit transfer though, so we'll see.

I like this idea. 
Yes, there are many services that let you sign up and send an email that can be redeemed for Bitcoin. For many users this is easier to use and understand, but it requires a third party. 
Yes, it should be Bip-38, otherwise reinventing the wheel with respect to encryption. Just encode the key and do the shared password extension over a second channel.
But, there is something very simple about the underlying concept. I would extend it so that the redemption is actually a full web wallet. There isn't any reason not to do that, and it makes it even easier to understand. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:51:13

This seems like a side channel attack that shouldn't be possible to pull off if the library in question is side channel resistant, operates in constant time, and doesn't have special paths or array indexing among other things.
It would be interesting to see if DJB's ed25519 is vulnerable, or even the libsecp256k1 library that the core devs have been working on. This type of attack has been known for a very long time, military hardware has included electromagnetic dampening for some time to thwart this type of analysis.

@_date: 2015-07-23 21:58:59
Well its relatively easy because they will probably control the keys for the participants, and the gateway by which transfers are done. So the data would be semi-public, but the control of the data would be centralized on their platform. So you couldn't initiate a transfer atomic or otherwise without using their system. I imagine this is how they will do it, it lets third parties audit the data, but centralizes the control. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:54:27
Sorry, I should have been more specific. Nobody who actually knows anything about large scale software engineering who doesn't work for blockstream. Its hard to prove a negative, but there are plenty of examples of core contributors and external software engineers who think that segwit is over complicated.

We have seen much larger mempools in the past, of course there is a point of no return when the number of transactions exceeds the block size and the mempool scales outwards significantly. I don't think we are there yet, but we are on our way.

This guy knows what he is talking about and is a strong candidate if you believe in a single Satoshi, but digital cash concepts have been around for a long time. I think it takes a real conceptual leap to put together all of those pieces, and that's the real genius in Bitcoin.
I've spoken with lots of smart people who are dismissive about the cryptography, or the hashing, or the mining, etc. They all lacked the ability to synthesize something so completely novel. This guy was in a better position than almost anyone to make that leap, but I'm still not convinced that he did. He also had a quite a bit of motivation in the form of his last failed attempt, being hacked by participants that destroyed the dream might have been enough to light a fire under anyone's ass. 
Anyway, waiting for a smoking gun, but I hope we don't find Satoshi. If it is one person they deserve to be left alone if that is what they want. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:12:01

They are pitching a future where the many blockchains interact with functionality that bitcoin core doesn't have, including faster transaction times, higher throughput, lower latency, etc, etc. So as long as Bitcoin core doesn't really scale there will be a need for their products.

How about Gavin or Jeff? Or are they not core enough? There are only 10 developers with more than 100 commits, the other 80 you speak of have under 20, and of those probably less than 6? have commit access.  SO the discussion is completely bottlenecked by a few people who owe allegience to a for-profit company that garners customers by providing alternatives to perceived problems with Bitcoin proper. You can dispute it, but for a community that is so anti-establishment people seem to be perfectly willing to accept this as A-OK.

I think its exactly because it isn't a utopia on earth that it has succeeded on the innovation front, and failed in many other ways. Seriously.

@_date: 2016-02-22 20:37:28
It isn't enough. Segwit by itself is not a scaling solution, and the block size increase has to happen anyway. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:06:17
except that it can't be used as a settlement layer. That is the whole point of the liquid network as a commercial product is that you can't trust zero confirms, the capacity is too low, and latency too high to do instant settlement on Bitcoin so you need to use another product. The conflict of interest is so unbeleivably clear.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:20:02
Nobody seriously believes that SegWit is the fastest and safest proposal. It does a lot of good things, fixing malleability is huge for the future network, but it also introduces a lot of complexity, new code, and attack vectors which aren't fully understood. Compound that with the idea that you have to upgrade pretty much the entire bitcoin infrastructure to understand these new transactions and there is a ton of code everywhere that has to be updated, tested, and vetted. By comparison a blocksize increase is a few lines of code, and can be simulated heavily in many environments and doesn't change any fundamental aspects of operation. It also provided significant breathing room while we work on and test all of the other things that need to be done to improve the network. Preferring SegWit to a blocksize increase is not a sound engineering decision.
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:17:24
Do you actually read what you post, or what? There seems to be a comprehension failure on your part, from the first sentence.
" It has useful attributes, notably addressing a major
malleability vector, but is not a short term scaling solution."
Which is exactly what I said, and the context in which I am speaking. I would argue that people who accept the current core vision of bitcoin are exactly letting other people think for them, other people with a vested interest in controlling bitcoin and the direction the network evolves.

So there is an alternative chain, it is checksumed every ten minutes, and then that data is put in the bitcoin blockchain, thereby creating an immutable record of that data set in time. How does this help a healthcare company maintain records better? They can do this right now with their existing infrastructure, and throw it into the blockchain if they wanted to. I think I'm missing a core component of this entire process. Why is this better than a traditional database with an API? How does this secure patient records, or keep them confidential? Can anyone provide a real technical explanation of this particular process?

Yeah I want to reiterate this. This is not high frequency trading, its just called algorithmic trading. The two are different. HFT operates &lt; 1 millisecond, and potentially much faster.

There are legions of gambling companies operating out of the UK, the situation in the states is significantly different. Perhaps it would have been better to say that the UK has gambling laws, whereas the US largely restricts gambling to very specific areas.

I want to spend time answering your points but I just don't have it now. I think that you are generalizing when you say people. Money transfer may not be a use case for you because you aren't interested in remittances. Paypal might be available to you but its not to billions of people. There are billions of unbanked people who have no way of storing wealth except under the mattress, or transfer money back home except through tens of intermediaries  each taking a cut. If you don't see the value of direct person to person transfer of wealth except for illegal goods and services than you aren't thinking enough. Comparing and contrasting Bitcoin with the infrastructure the US or Europe has kind of misses the point.

The technical answer is rolling nlocktime, but its actually a huge pain in the ass in reality. A better solution is simply use the same mechanisms that you do for all of your other property, namely  a will, a lawyer, and a multisignature arrangement such that funds can be redeemed with either 1 or two other keys. 
Technically easier, less likely to result in lost funds, subject to the same mechanisms as your other property. If you don't wish to involve anyone else put the secondary key in a bip-38 paper wallet or mnemonic with pass-phrase that should be obvious to your beneficiaries i.e shared secret and put it somewhere safe where it will be found or delivered upon your death.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:46:05
This guy is not right, but the question is made more complicated by addresses. Each private key has a single public key but that public key can have two representations, i.e compress vs uncompressed. Each representation generates a different address. So a single key pair, with multiple formats can generate 2 distinct bitcoin addresses.
Also based on the answer above an extended HD pair lets you derive an unlimited number of private keys from which you can derive public keys. Each private key only has one associated public key though, and two possible address representations.
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:25:42
Because good ideas aren't enough?
First, platform limitations are a problem. I would seriously recommend looking at Qt for cross platform application development, or even splitting the application into a client/server model with the gui being hosted by a web browser. GnuStep is very very far behind the library support of the mac, I'm not an expert in GnuStep but the last time I looked at it there just wasn't any comparison.
Second you need to get the word out into the community and help grow the platform. It may be that for many purposes its better than OpenBazaar, but people need to know why and how. 
I'd like to see projects like this succeed, but growing that user base is really the hardest part of the equation.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:19:27
This is a cool idea, but there are a lot of people working on it. Direct credit card integration and NFC payments are coming one way or the other. It seems like a very easy idea to copy. I would focus on being the goto people for gateway services into those networks and let anyone integrate, running a consumer focused app that does this is a dead end, it will be a commodity service shortly. It also makes you an acquisition target for Mastercard if you get traction.

Coinlock used to do this before I shut it down. I ran it continuously for two years, but there just wasn't the transaction volume to support the infrastructure associated with a centralized version of it. Maybe things are picking up again and its worth relaunching, version 2.0 would definitely be based on my color coin platform, and I would structure it so that it could be completely fee to end users. I had a lot of features that mega has like user side encryption, multi-worker download, and currency pegged pricing, and I like providing it as a service to the community.
If there is real interest in this type of service let me know, I'd be interested in hearing use cases and what they would like to see from such a service.
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:10:08
I'll give it a look, it seems cool. Generally the way to do this is to hype your product first for six months and then not deliver. You have it mixed up, you already delivered! :) My inclination at first glance is that you want to rely more heavily on the integrity that the blockchain provides for data storage and referencing, and use the raft portions only to sync up data that has been checkpointed into the blockchain by the original publisher.
So a publisher controls the version of the data that everyone can see, and comments, votes, etc are linked to payment. Nothing cuts down on spam more than having to put your money where your mouth is.

Nobody makes money on the scanners, but the software has become a useful feature in a lot of applications. I was specifically thinking of the Amazon mobile apps that let you price check and deliver physical items you see in the store. The Cue Cat's initial vision was to enable this real time pricing, order, and delivery where reviews could instantly be looked up based on scanning etc. They made the physical device because there wasn't a cheap way to do scanning at the time. It was also a pre-mobile idea and that is really where it missed the mark. My CueCats have a ps/2 connector, hardly a great way to check barcodes at the super market. 
Its just an example where the market absorbed the ideas that made up the CueCat in a more efficient way, and ultimately those ideas made sense but the product they delivered at the time did not. They were way too early, but I think the design of that product influenced several of the ecommerce experiences we saw later.

There is a lot of downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. Lots of coins being produced, and demand that isn't increasing enough to absorb that supply. Combine that with a stronger dollar, and I expect we will see the price continue to fall. If the network retracts which seems likely I think there will be even further price pressure downwards, so a price target just north of $100 isn't completely unreasonable.

This is nothing new. Big banks get together create private standard and network. It has happened numerous times before, and will continue to happen. There isn't any doubt that it is possible to create a fast permissioned central ledger. Databases are awesome.
It fails to understand the network effects though. There is about zero chance that this new ledger will run on a private network vs the Internet, the key to understanding that is the key to understanding why Bitcoin has such a huge leg up on these efforts.

The CueCat was designed to enable a whole host of ecommerce applications. Almost all of them have come true because of a cheap universal device for snapping barcodes, the mobile phone. I have a few of these cuecats lying around, and its really just another case of a brilliant idea at the wrong time and before the pieces were in place to realize its vision.

Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. From a cost and speed perspective the centralized money transmitters can be extremely efficient. Bitcoin is more like the death from a thousand cuts, where remittance companies spring up all over the world especially in under served markets. Whether it can serve as the backbone for these types of payments is an issue of scalability and also btc liquidity in markets that pair trade the local currency.

 So many ways to think about tackling the scalability. What if initial users just did headers first, but then got merkleblocks for all unspent transactions in the utxo set. We just need to build a merkle proof of the utxo set and embed it in the blockchain itself, similiar to how ethereum works then we could do trusted transfer and still have blocks on hand for propagation. 
Similarly instead of propagating entire blocks maybe its possible for synced clients to just get the header, backfill from the mempool, and then request the transactions or partial blocks that are missing. 
One thing is for sure, lack of real leadership on scalability could easily kill off bitcoin in favor of a much more restrictive alternative sanctioned directly by government and banks. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:06:54
Like most problems it gets harder when you have constraints. Low latency, continuous operation, memory, simultaneous users etc.  You can write a simple matching engine in a day, but the devil is in the details. There could be multiple order types, disconnects mid transaction, you might need to do real time asset tracking for participants to determine capital requirements. You need a way of monitoring and interacting with live orders and participants. etc. etc. How many instruments can you handle per engine, how do you handle internal order routing?
I agree its simple on the surface, but there are gotchas. A lot of companies write their own matching engines and hit every single one of them.

It's amateur hour in Bitcoin land. I listened to the Blockstream team's analogies at the recent Bitdev NY meetup and honestly I've never heard so much FUD in my life. Completely non-technical fear mongering, as far as I'm concerned they have hijacked the development process for core.
Peter Todd needs to stop complaining about how things can't happen, stop the ad-hominen attacks against core developers, and approach the entire process from a technical perspective. In fact every single one of them should explain in a detailed technical way why core can't scale up today, and what the best way forward is. Put up or shut up really.

I think i meant to say used as the root. :)
So when you use bip-32 you can generate master sub keys which are capable of generating their own subtrees, or you can just export a single key. 
I think that the first address in the hierachy is showing up when you import the bip-32 keypair, they are just both using the same path to get to that same address,
This might be the first bip-44 address, m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0 
There is no hard and fast rule that says a mnemonic has to be used for bip-32, it could be a straight private key. 
I'd like to give you a specific answer about those two wallets but I'm not sure about their implementation and haven't looked into it. I would do a quick experiment generate a mnemonic use it for a public/private keypair and see if that is what is showing up, if not then run it through the default paths for bip-44
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:41:06
I get it, but all of the banks use the Internet.  The point is its possible to create permissioned technologies on top of unpermissioned ones. The reverse however is basically impossible. So because you have permissionless innovation on Bitcoin the network effects should drown out this private ledger talk so long as we can make real inroads on scale. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:38:41
I really don't like this. For several reasons.
First, it is almost completely unnecessary.
Second, now third party software has to be modified to support this additional way that the unspent pool can change and be tested against.  So now double spends that are actually vetted by the user are relayed and applied instead of being thrown out.  For those of us writing third party software its just another thing to worry about to maintain compliance with core. 
Third, double spends do happen frequently, but now we create a whole new vector. If you are trying to rate the confidence factor of the zero confirm, if RBF is opted in you can't be sure until after confirmation, whereas now you can make a pretty good guess based on node propagation and other factors.

If it was that simple. Pulling in money via recurring payments in the adult space is a proven model, a company would have to break the mold and be successful not charing that way for the industry to shift. Some people will pay a premium for their privacy, but many won't. Most people are willing to sign away pretty much all of their privacy, the proliferation and vast success of facebook proves it.
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:35:22
I don't understand the question entirely. You can just generate a single keypair if you want, but the mnemonic is meant for seeding bip-32 master keys. If you want to generate a single address under the bip-32 hierarchy you can do that easily.  Also gives you cross compatibility of your entire key set across wallets, instead of having to import/export individual key pairs. 
The mnemonic itself is up to 32 bytes, but the seed used as the room is 64 bytes since you run it through hmac-512. 
If you used the mnemonic to generate a 32 byte number you could then use that as the private key in a keypair directly, but most software runs the mnemonic through a secondary step for bip-32 generation.
@_date: 2015-11-28 12:13:07
Why do you say that? There are a ton of wallets, and lots of backend bitcoin software being developed. I don't think there is any data on how many of these solutions hide opt-in transactions. I'm also not sure why you would want to hide them to begin with, then you can't take action on them, which seems like a worse position then we are in now where at least there is user choice. I agree with many here, this is a solution in search for a problem with unclear ramifications with respect to rollout.  It's just not a good idea that has little to no benefit for the network to justify the work involved for everyone else.

It's always been the contention that testing a bigger block size increase will take years, but SegWit is ready now. If a bigger block size is logically the simpler solution of the two, then why was the more complicated solution prioritized? I'm not talking in absolutes, but it really doesn't add up. So the assertion that nobody has ever said that isn't correct, that has been the implicit argument since the beginning. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 12:51:18
I get it, but this is still structurally different, and if opt-in were to be widely used or enabled would completely kill the unconfirmed transaction. Why encourage and formalize what amounts to double spend behaviour? This seems like just another idealogical change rather than a technical one meant to bolster the capabilitities of the network. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:48:57
Because in order for your coins to be transferred out the other exchanges have to agree? Except that they programatically agree... I think this just pushes the ball around. If an exchange gets hacked it can issue perfectly legitimate transfers into Bitcoin, the Liquid protocol doesn't prevent that from happening.

The solution is fix the wallets. If that is too difficult then we can see why RBF is a problem. It's really completely unecessary except as a way to ultimately destroy 0-confirms utility. The talk of putting this as the default mode in bitcoin core's client really makes it obvious that this is the direction they are trying to take the network and that it ultimately decreases utility.  It's an ideological patch not a useful one.

At the time the Internet was this weird strange thing that nobody outside of the military or academia could imagine using. Nobody knew how to monetize it, nobody understood what problems it might solve, or what markets it might create. Most people lack vision. Any kind of real coherent insight into the future. The people here are on the first wave of something that could completely revolutionize finance, industry and  government.

I don't think there is any doubt that a more efficient global remittance pipeline can ultimately be built on top of Bitcoin. Every single one is the same. Get payment from consumer via established mechanism (Phone, 711, whatever) convert to Bitcoin, send to foreign exchange and trade for local currency -&gt; use local delivery method (Direct to door, convenience etc)
That model can be replicated tens of thousands of times, and already we see companies doing this in many major markets, all of which will be competing on price. Which will drive the time and cost down to negligible numbers.

I noticed the malleability attack, was wondering if other people were being caused grief. It is annoying that is for sure. 
Its not an easy problem to fix as there are many potential sources of malleability in bitcoin transactions, I'm not sure if bip62 is authoritative on the subject or if there are other vectors not accounted for. 
In the meantime smarter software is in order, you can detect when a transaction has been malleated, it looks almost exactly like a double spend except with identical inputs/outputs and report this fact upstream. I've noticed that some of the block explorers don't seem to be doing this right.

Those are all valid questions, for which I don't have the answers. :) I mean in theory the wallet itself could steal your funds pretty much at any time if it was malicious. It doesn't make much sense as a legitimate business to do that, especially if I'm trying to sell a hardware encryption engine. I think from a cost perspective we are looking at something a fraction of the price of a Trezor, like $20 or less to enable the functionality. My conversation wasn't that deep though, so don't take it for gospel. :) It certainly seems like a very good compromise for people wanting to secure digital currency funds, and a long the same model as the greenbits wallet code released recently.

Well remember when they had coprocessors to do floating point math? I imagine this as a blockchain coprocessor, a secure module with a bunch of functionality for hooking up to blockchains, validating transactions, maybe mining and other functionality but in a small inexpensive form factor out-of-band with the machine. You could then drop that into any device that required payments to provide a service or needed to secure data in a decentralized way. Vending applications, parking meters, traditional servers, etc. The entire machine-to-machine payments and data sharing infrastructure is almost completely unexplored.
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:44:25
The hype is strong with this one. There isn't nearly enough information to determine how this really works or what the threat vectors are.  Just because you have multiple partners auto-signing transactions doesn't make them more secure, it just pushes the ball around.
Further there are already so many ways to accomplish this, building out their own blockchain to do transfer seems silly. If you trust your partners you can use zero conf just fine, or come up a multiparty "signing" server for sending and receiving deposits, pretty much exactly what liquid  does without all of the additional complexity. 
Seems to me if the argument is that the bitcoin network doesn't have capacity then that flies directly in the face of the long running argument that blockstream didn't have an ulterior motive for stalling blocksize increases.

You are missing a few things. First, Moore's law. Ever download a game from steam? How big was it, how long did it take to download? If you had to download that same game 4 years ago, how long would it take? What about 8? The bitcoin network is heavily influenced by increasing capacity in memory, bandwidth, storage, processing and networking.  Second, and most importantly nobody who knows what they are talking about is arguing for 100 megabyte blocks, so this is a essentially a straw man argument. People are arguing for a minor and consistent increase in block size to deal with immediate scale issues, while other solutions are thoroughly tested and vetted. Does that sound unreasonable? Why are we denying ourselves breathing room to pursue a much more complicated solution immediately?
There are also numerous ways to increase capacity and transaction processing on the existing network that nobody is really exploring. So yes, it does all come down to human greed, politics, and manipulation.

The network has to scale to reach its true value. There are only a few feasible ways to do this, off the top of my head.
1) Increase the block size limit
2) Use side chains to laterally scale
3) Have wallet software that can operate across multiple chains.
4) Increase off chain transactions through traditional centralized points of trust (i.e coinbase model)
5) More compression on the transactions i.e opcodes that expand to represent standard p2pkh for example. Saves you room in aggregate.
Doing nothing will ultimately decrease the utility of the system as it fails to work as demand increases.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:10:37
Actually, there is a pretty clear complexity argument for Segwit vs just increasing the block size. It does enable things that aren't currently possible, but Bitcoin would scale pretty well without any of those changes, and there are simpler approaches to addressing malleability. What SegWit does enable more than anything else is competing models to Bitcoin and value transfer off chain which is key to a certain companies business model. When people push too hard all you have to do is follow the money. All things being equal the simpler solution is usually the one to do first, especially in a software project as complicated as Bitcoin. The assertion that SegWit isn't a big change and that increasing the blocksize represents some huge technical hurdle and an existential threat to Bitcoin is just pure fear mongering.

An ASIC can pretty much do anything. Its just a low power, inexpensive alternative to a general purpose processor designed for a specific set of purposes. So a processor specifically geared for handling network connections, merkle proofs, transaction validation etc, might be an interesting way of connecting devices.

The asics on the backend I think are securing arbitrary number of blockchains for different devices.

They are being cagey on purpose. Nobody wants to just come out and say, yeah we forked bitcoin, ripped some stuff out and are selling it to you. What is important is that it is not Bitcoin, just another alt coin modeled on top of a blockchain system with most of the parts that make bitcoin interesting removed so that it can support higher throughput but still largely be compatible in case Bitcoin ends up winning. You need a migration path back and if you make too many fundamental changes you burn your bridges behind you.

I'm extremely skeptical about the long term prospects of this.

I get it but what is the ultimate advantage to doing this? There already is a large well secured connected network for transferring funds, its called Bitcoin. There already are mechanisms to do Asset issuance and transfer on that network, and it requires no third party. The only thing that makes sense is that it might be faster, but I'm not entirely sure why that matters either. If the five firms trust each other than they can accept 0 confs backed up by a legal arrangement, and secured by insurance. The cost of which is probably less than licensing and running their own network. Ultimately they are forming a trusted relationship where the majority are honest by building a parallel network. 
So I'm not sure what the advantages of this over Bitcoin really are. It seems like a complicated mechanism to do what we can already do, and it has tons of its own downsides.

@_date: 2015-02-03 17:26:56
I just read the Factom white paper. Its a complex system that boils down to hashing chains of data and sticking the hashes into the Bitcoin blockchain so that you can audit the data in the external system and benefit from an external proof of work. Its a fancy version of proof of existence that relies heavily on a separate distributed data store.
What you are trying to accomplish you can do with the normal bitcoin blockchain. You just hash all of the OS components of a release into a single hash. So you could "freeze" the state of the system and then verify that it hasn't changed against the external data store periodically. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:33:03
Except there is no way to guarantee that monopoly money isn't counterfeit. There is no way to audit it. There is no utility, or use case within the ecosystem. I think there is a very strong argument that burned coins can translate their value directly into tokens. I built an Ethereum project based on that premise ( which caused a debate on just this subject.  In general there are many properties that  a burned token has that some random piece of paper does not, and the mechanism has been effectively used by counterparty and other coins/tokens. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:11:47
Counterparty makes a fairly poor distributed exchange, there are better ways to do it, and with atomic swaps in colored coin I think we will see it.

I think there is a complete lack of skepticism about the claims that side chains makes. It essentially allows an altcoin and chain to sit next to bitcoin, and move value from one to the other. That secondary chain has none of the security of Bitcoin, it is not equivalent to bitcoin, but is denominated in a fixed bitcoin price by the creator. The economic incentive is strange. The chain can set its own fees also which I think is the mechanism by which an alt coin scam gets perpetuated. Its also not clear to me whether a side chain could be premined up to a certain block, or start out with a non 0 amount of coins in circulation.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:30:22

That is a reasonable approach. Basically turn the laptop into a captive portal wifi access point with bitcoin support added for payment. Package the whole thing up as a VM and voila.  Still seems like a lot of work, I don't think the market opportunity is here for it to be a commercially viable project. As others have mentioned, access is ubiquitous, and in the places where it isn't bitcoin proliferation is fairly low. You could probably add bitcoin support to an already existing live-cd router project, of which there must be a few and hash it out in an afternoon as a proof of concept, easier than dealing with all of the platform specific stuff.

The rate of Bitcoin at a given exchange is determined by 2 things.
1) What is someone willing to pay to buy a Bitcoin on that exchange
2) What is someone willing to sell a Bitcoin for on an exchange
The bid/ask spread is the difference between these two values. A company like Bitpay would probably run a converged order book. Thats a list of buy orders and sell orders across all of the exchanges they do business with. The top orders in this book are the best price they can sell for, and the best price they can buy for at that moment. 
This is the same mechanism that pretty much every open market uses, including stocks, bonds, and currency / foreign exchange.
The price they give you is usually that price with say a 1% variance baked in at the time of your order.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:22:53
Chaturbate could be completely cut out of the revenue stream if the girls realized that they could get paid directly in Bitcoin without an intermediary which takes 20%+ of their revenue. Its also possible to circumvent token buying for digital goods, and additional sources of revenue fairly easily. 
There have been a few sites that have tried to replicate that functionality in Bitcoin, but they just don't have the traffic to make them viable. I think you pretty much need to accept traditional payment methods also if you want to compete.
Edit: I'd also like to note that they don't accept Bitcoin related ads to their site.  They are definitely concerned that bitcoin may undermine their revenue model which is entirely based on selling tokens. I'm also pretty sure at one point there was a lively exchange rate between chaturbate tokens and BTC on the OTC markets.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:16:40


Mostly higher level functionality. Not the generate an address, or give me an unspent, but building real end-to-end applications remains challenging. The building blocks are all there, but the frameworks aren't comprehensive. For example, Coinlock is a fairly simple conceptual application but requires a lot of glue to function. Web callbacks, event streams etc. This is especially true for low level protocol details, OP_RETURN protocols, multisig outputs etc.


This is awesome, good idea.


I think for a lot of financial applications you don't want to rely on any third party service. You want to be able to self-host, run the code etc. Especially when it comes to key management.

This is neat, using DHTs to provide storage and other functionality on top of Bitcoin is the logical thing to do. I think keys need to be kept fresh in order to be persistent though, so you guys are storing all of the data on your side to fulfill requests for infrequently access keys?

If we made some minor changes to Bitcoin it would be unnecessary to sync the entire block chain and we could essentially checkpoint just like Ethereum. So a full node could come online almost instantly. This is regardless of the size of the blocks.

There are multiple ways this could happen but I think that network utility will ultimately drive the price. If we begin using it like a new untapped Internet protocol, that is essentially being paid for on-demand via the purchase of Bitcoin the price should explode as demand increases.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:01:46
Maybe I just misunderstand Factom, but doesn't it by definition rely on an external service to hold all of the meta data? So if you were running a global decentralized file store on the blockchain but had to constantly check with centralized meta data servers for data validation doesn't that negate the point?
It seems like StorJ is tackling this problem but on a more decentralized scale, and specifically by targeting the payment and allocation, and persistent of distributed storage.

Its a good point, and certainly I've railed against middlemen multiple times. I believe in the promise of programmable money. In the short to mid term though we have an existing system that needs to be integrated with for the purpose of fiat conversion, traditional banking, etc. Friction in that integration is not a good thing for any of us. There are still a lot of essential money transfer and banking functions that we can't yet support with distributed infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:17:35

I have some context in this area. I built coinlock.com which does micropayment content selling, and generates links to that content that you can put anywhere.  I looked extensively into clip4sale, and even though it looks like it was developed in '95, its got a ton of traffic. This is why people are willing to sell content there as a loss leader, because it acts as a funnel to their own sites where they can sell direct.

I don't think its a trap, just that it isn't getting the high level attention it deserves.

Well, there are fairly limited API services and platform options that are open source. We have a plethora of closed services offering very similiar functionality. Bitcoin core is great, but it also doesn't address the needs of all people building blockchain applications, nor should it. There is a lot of room for other options. Blockcypher, chain.com, gem.co, coinkite, and even blockchain.info and coinbase are building commercial APIs because of perceived limitations and complexity (sometimes justified) with the open source tools available.

I think people in the Bitcoin space underestimate just how much industry awareness ripple and stellar have. The former is very actively being embraced by banks, despite the fact that Bitcoin is in many ways superior. Not having a bank-friendly face to help sell Bitcoin as a platform, as well as a complete lack of understanding with regards to security and integrity is hurting adoption within large companies. Mt.

As much as I am in the freedom first crowd, there are legitimate purposes for optional assignment of identity. Onename.io takes this approach because having validated names makes it easy to look up receiving addresses for people as an example.
It seems that this is an attempt to bring a better business bureau to Bitcoin with validated merchant identities. I think the larger idea of forcing users to use this system just isn't compatible with the way Bitcoin is designed. Any good wallet software is going to use new change addresses to help protect the anonymity of the user, and constantly registering these new addresses with a centralized party is fairly unlikely.

I think its a really interesting idea, especially how it uses the networks intrinsic properties, but as a leak mechanism there are a few issues.
First there isn't any way to verify the file, if its in a binary format, or simply gibberish there isn't any way to tell. So you are asking people to take a leap of faith in buying the leaked data. For a text file it may work, as you would get discrete decoded snippets as keys were revealed.
Second, there isn't any way to tell which keys belong to what file except by publishing a manifest, there is a significant amount of data that needs to be published and stored somewhere in order to advertise the leak. 
Finally, as multiple people have noticed there isn't any incentive to spend the bitcoin and reveal the public keys at all once the money has been secured.

I think what we are seeing is a hardware play into internet of things, backed by commercial data centers that interface with blockchains. So even though they say its strictly bitcoin related, I think there is a big chance its more blockchain related, with Bitcoin being one of the available networks. Doing more mining does not increase consumer adoption, and even with major advances it isn't profitable in the way a 100+ million in investment wants.
So a blockchain aware chip, that has the ability to interface with multiple blockchains for facilitating secure transactions is more interesting. Probably an SPV style device chip, with the really heavy lifting done by colocated asics and general purpose servers.

I think it affects a wider variety of businesses than you realize. If your entire bitcoin model is to accept it as a payment method you are fine, but the crypto innovation that is happening is largely centered around various types of exchange. So this licensing bill isn't something that affects Bitcoin with respect to consumers, but could have implications for companies and people building new technology around Bitcoin. In other words the innovators in the space, the people you need to attract if you want to stake a claim.
There is a real concern that the cost of doing business for startups will be too high, combined with the already skyrocketing costs of doing business in NY make it an increasingly unattractive place to build anything.

So using USD as an example, the exchange rate is literally how much USD I will spend for a bitcoin on an exchange, or how much USD I will get if I sell a bitcoin. It isn't calculated by the exchange, its an emergent property of people trading in an open market. When you see big differences in the rates its usually because the price hasn't converged yet, either its too slow, or there isn't enough liquidity or any number of reasons. If information traveled perfectly the rate would be the same everywhere.
How a company prices their products based on the exchange rate differs per company. I have no insight into how Bitpay does it, except as I stated earlier as a value derived from the best prices in the market that they can reasonable hope to get if they were to purchase or sell into that market. They could also do a weighted average cost across exchanges, etc. Its generally probably the best price they can get with a baked in 1% profit in case of short term variance in price from the time they quote you until you execute a purchase.

I don't know if this is necessarily a problem, if the participants in the smart contract agree to honor the same oracle.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:46:28
Neat. I read the thesis paper, its interesting. The first heuristic is change grouping, so associating change addresses with a single wallet or entity based on the inputs being controlled by the same entity. There are exceptions to that rule though, i.e the way Lighthouse works would be a multiple entity input transaction. So you should probably not classify transactions which aren't SIGHASH_ALL as an example. Cool, looking forward to where you take it.

I'm not sure I understand the use case of OP_Return for the layman. There are specific protocol enhancements that rely on it, second generation functionality, but why would I want to do this from a web service?

Its like we just fast forwarded 5 years into the future and are watching an infomercial at 2 am.

Isn't NBitcoin spv?

They are talking about an assassination market as a contract. Such a contract would require an Oracle source, but is well in the realm of the possible.

I remember when I first saw this. It broke my blockchain parser at the time. :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:52:22
This is exactly the thing. First off, obviously they bake in the cost into the currency spread, and thats a very soft thing. Its very difficult for a consumer to know how far off market rate they are getting vs doing it themselves. Secondly, and this is the issue I have with all of the local remittances businesses popping up, I think the pipeline itself can be automated heavily. Thats Wallet -&gt; Exchange -&gt; Local delivery. Reduces cost, fairer rates, less intermediaries.
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:24:48
I watched the video, and read through the available info. It looked complicated. Maybe in some certain circumstances it isn't, but for the vast majority of people doing fiat trades it is. If I am buying Fiat from a person who is banked in the UK and want it delivered to a bank in the US, its not applicable is it? Most people trading in a decentralized exchange probably aren't in the same bank, or even in the same country.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:23:57
Right, but backtracking isn't something that is supported by a standard client without RPC, can't arbitrarily request transactions not in the txpool. So any client needs to be modified to support an SPV-like mode.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:06:29
You are when they actively use your name to promote them, put your picture on their website, and use the fact that you advised them as a selling point. Doesn't seem that hard to understand. Context man.
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:38:27
I think your competitors won't want to pay you a spread. :) I get it though. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:30:36
Right. So really block bitcoin traffic on three networks and the network size decreases dramatically because of centralization on cloud services. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:03:50
This seems like an easy business to replicate. Take bitcoin, sell on exchange and take the spread, integrate with local api for delivery. I think we will see hundreds of companies that do this in the next five years all over the place. 
Edit: Also, once we see that the western unions can put more price pressure than they currently do. Their money transfer is mostly just netting things out on a balance sheet across bank accounts held in different countries.

You could use Coinlock. :) It's easy to link content into any blog or system. I've been thinking of ways of making it even friendlier for people with lots of content, drop me a line if you have any ideas.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:20:10
All of the speed and none of the security. But seriously, getting this right is really hard. This is a whole largely unexplored research area.

I've looked at BitcoinJ, its really nice. A lot of functionality, its a good place to start for a lot of projects. I've been trying to develop higher level frameworks for my own internal uses. Thinking of packaging it up open source so that others can benefit, and running some micro lighthouse campaigns to prioritize additions.
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:30:53
You don't need a token to drive a private blockchain. I would call that semi trusted, in that usually you are using some kind of distributed consensus and only can tolerate a certain low number of bad actors. The token on the public block chains helps defend from denial of service style attacks, but there are other ways to mitigate this in private scenarios.
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:38:08
No reason, I just picked a selection of wallets that matched was bitcoin.org was promoting. Educating users who are not familiar with bitcoin is very tricky, I would love to hear suggestions. I've done a lot to streamline the site, but getting people who don't have bitcoin experience into the system is an evolving problem. :)
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:20:25
Yeah, but proof of work is more secure at the moment. It sounds like a lot of electricity, but its a drop in the bucket compared with what it costs to run a traditional payments network, especially one with physical delivery requirements.
@_date: 2013-08-13 00:44:39
Hi everyone,
This was the number one most requested feature from the last thread we had on this, so I've gone back and added support. I hope you guys like it. :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:27:39
symmetric key information is encoded in the link itself, which is up to the user to distribute. The mechanism the user chooses affects the privacy, a blog post, versus email, pgp encrypted, printed out, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:53:06
Is there any explanation about how this works or what it is? How are they clustering addresses most likely to belong to the same entity? It seems very hand wavy to me.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:30:49
Doesn't coinspark require a separate meta data server? Doesn't seem like it can run without the commercial entity or by running a meta data server to support the asset you are running. Its also not SPV in the traditional sense, because it has to contact the tracking servers referenced by the asset in order to validate the coloring data. So yes the client doesn't have to download the blockchain, but it does have to rely on their servers to validate transactions. Pretty much the same situation of any web based wallet, it can't connect to the btc network only.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:52:00
Well because the value proposition in the short term is different. Its a valid sales tactic in the short term, and for many people it does make sense to have a more personal experience, especially with a new technology they don't understand. In the long term it might not pan out that way, but then you change providers if the inertia isn't too great.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:01:33
This is correct, I misspoke. Maybe firefox WebAPI/FileHandleAPI is appropriate for this though, if anyone has expertise in that specifically I would love to know. :)
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:47:01
It is a mechanism proposed by Blockstream to do two-way pegging of Bitcoin between alt coin chains.  So you can move value between Bitcoin and other blockchains, and vice versa. Its basically a way of using alternative chains to provide different functionality or increase scale, but preserve the digital scarcity of Bitcoin. Its not without its flaws, but it may help to scale the network.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:21:59
Well the commercial solutions like hyperledger are blockchains. You are right that there is some kind of trusted initial setup, but let's say two out of three peers are honest, still had consensus to drive it. raft/paxos etc can drive those types of solutions. Also state transition is still driven by some kind of public key Cryptography, so you can't really make changes that honest peers will accept.
Public blockchains are great, but there are design considerations with respect to transactional throughput that don't fit all possible use cases. I'm not defending public blockchains by the way, they exist, some are good, I would prefer a public one.

I run Coinlock.com, and very few users have self reported that they are using the service for pornography. There is an amateur couple on reddit that posted though, I found that very interesting as they really used the service at it was intended, a zero infrastructure way of selling content. Kudos to them, please make more amateur porn ;-)
In any event my dealings with cam and other adult sites is that many are not interested in taking Bitcoin given the well established mechanisms that already exist. Also certain cam sites are more than happy dealing in tokens rather than currency and forbid bitcoin related advertising (I'm looking at you chaturbate!) 
It seems like the perfect industry given the privacy concerns, but adoption is very limited.
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:16:22
I'll follow up, its because Firefox doesn't and won't support the filesystem api, 
I think that as an alternative I should be able to write blob data using this IndexedDB locked file api, 
Any experience with this? What is the preferred method for chunking binary data to disk?
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:14:40
Its a slightly different use case. This is definitely designed to help  you monetize content. So if you have a piece of digital content and then want to be able to sell it direct with bitcoin, this makes it very easy to do. Its also nice to have pretty strong assurances of privacy and anonymity also, its really nobody's business what you buy or sell, so long as its legal.

Maybe its naive, but google themselves would probably resist putting a backdoor into Chrome. The negative PR on discovery would be absolutely monumental, and given the source proximity with Chromium, it seems like that is something that could be determined. That being said, diversity is important, I can completely understand why it makes sense to support Firefox and I'm going to try and do so. I want people using Tor browser bundle and other firefox based software to be able to use the site.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:43:51
Wish I had known about it, might have stopped by. :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 10:58:01
I'm working on it! I thought the support I needed wasn't in Firefox, but several people have pointed out that it probably is, I just missed it. If that is the case, you can expect a firefox version. I understand people want to use Tor browser and I'll try and fascilitate that.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:00:08
HTTPS is you to the server, and from the server to you.
End to End, means that the data is encrypted in your own browser, and decrypted in the receivers browser. So in addition to HTTPS the data is fully encrypted by the time it hits my systems, is encrypted at rest (i.e on disk). So for example a data breach or third party access wouldn't get any unencrypted data.
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:26:30
I think you are right. I was specifically referring to the filesystem api, but if all the support I need is there I will definitely get a firefox version of the site up. That would be awesome, and I want to support it.  Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:40:02
This does answer some questions, but the comments are a bit more accurate when it comes to information about confirmations.
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:35:54
I encourage you to read my terms of service, privacy policy, and dmca take down. Illegal content is not allowed. Period. The site is not designed for that type of content, and I am going necessary steps to prevent it. Privacy is a tricky line to walk, but I will to do everything I can to protect users of this service and comply with the law.
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:03:50
Hi guys,
Since I built this I will comment. :)
The main feature that chrome supports that firefox doesn't is html5 local storage. Its necessary to support streaming decryption to disk of large files. There are ways around it, like a flash plugin or java, but I wanted to keep the entire thing html5, and ultimately that will make it easier to code audit. There is also some stuff in the upload process that Chrome makes easier, but i didn't want people to upload in firefox and immediately prevent them from downloading because they didn't have local storage support.
@_date: 2013-08-07 10:56:21
I agree with you. I'm definitely working on making it more transparent, and will be releasing the front end for review. Increasing the trust is something that I am actively working on. I do believe strongly in user privacy though, and the encryption and decryption is client side. So I just can't decrypt the data. Thats a fact given the way it is architected, but I'll see what I can do to prove it to you. An architecture page might help.
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:22:13
Cool thanks, I appreciate that :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:47:00
It doesn't feel to me like Coinbase was built by people who have actually built exchanges before professionally. That is expensive. Gemini is a little better in that regard, but the liquidity isn't as good.
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:42:54
I'm not sure I follow... its a pure bitcoin system. The receiving address is a bitcoin address, and the payment is done via bitcoin. I don't deal with currency conversion, money transfer, or any of those issues.
@_date: 2013-08-07 20:52:07
Alright, this makes sense to me given the documentation I've seen on the mozilla site. Thanks. I'll probably go down this route.
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:05:20
What about the bitmessage protocol?  I think the distributed shared mail system modeled in part on alt.anonymous is the way to do it.
@_date: 2013-08-07 21:15:03
I've taken your advice and put Prices right at the top with a simplified fee breakdown so you can assess the total cost.
@_date: 2013-08-12 22:46:21
Just a quick update, I wanted to let anyone still watching this thread know that due to the comments here I have released initial Firefox support, please give it a shot and let me know how it works for you.
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:03:14
This is really cool. I hadn't realized how far the bitcoin for physical product space was coming :) My product is all digital (coinlock.com, shameless plug) but its great to see these new services, an ever growing economy.
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:32:10
Should also work with Chromium, but point noted. As I commented below, perhaps I can work through the firefox issues I was having with a recent build and get that out. It is definitely something I want to support.
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:32:16
This is awesome. Regulatory issues in the US are going to be rough, but still doable. I'll probably look into it myself. :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 04:20:12
Thats really cool, love to chat with you about it some time. I think there is a lot of interesting stuff that can be done in that space. :)
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:46:55
I agree with this. I think people who are sophisticated enough to want to pay their gas bill in Bitcoin are going to be able to pay you with a mobile wallet, or send to a bitcoin address you control to get credit. You don't need Bitpay or any other middle man to accept payment, but if you do so you will be responsible for trading it out into USD at an exchange or other venue.
@_date: 2013-08-07 23:30:21
Whats the best way to reach you? Drop me an email at support AT coinlock DOT com, interested in finding out more.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:13:07
I'd like to point out that you can use Tor quite well without tor browser, but I understand that makes it easier. The recent exploit specificallly targetting the firefox version in tor browser should give people pause. Either way, I'm going to address this. A lot of people clearly want native firefox support including myself. :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:08:42
I might swap them out with others then.. I hate to downgrade a user to a non secure connection to get to a wallet site.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:42:43
I think these guys have gotten a lot of slack, based on events that are very murky. At the end of the day they walked away with quite a bit of cash, who is to say whether they deserved it or not.
That being said exposure for Bitcoin, and a regulated investment entity such that anyone can purchase Bitcoin through an ETF is a very good thing for everyone. I hope it does really well.
@_date: 2013-08-09 12:49:31
Its a valid concern. I've worked on making the transfer process fairly resilient, but there are always possibilities outside my immediate control like loss of power. I'll give this some more thought, certainly the intent is to deliver every single time without fail.
@_date: 2013-08-07 04:16:47
So you make a site which sells the same content using group buying and then distribute it? Sounds like a good idea, well except that its piracy. What is to stop someone from downloading some content and then putting it on bittorrent? Nothing. This isn't designed to stop piracy of content, its just designed to provide another legal means of selling content directly in the bitcoin economy. It could also be used for work for hire, or other person to person transactions. I think you can probably come up with a lot of potential uses. I see your point, but there are plenty of people who are willing to pay for content to support the person or group creating it, stopping all piracy is beyond the scope of this project :).

I'l definitely update that, I realized earlier that for older versions of Firefox it might tell you to upgrade to Chrome. I'm going to change that to 'Please upgrade your browser to Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to use this site.'
Coinlock is a very fast way of monetizing content in the Bitcoin economy, and doing so in both an anonymous and secure manner. Basically you upload content, specify a price, and Coinlock encrypts the content in browser, and generates a pay link for download.  You can then take the link and put it into an existing blog or e-commerce site, or really any place a link can be used and give people one step purchasing ability with Bitcoin.
The fees are assessed per download, I added a Prices explanation at the top, and the BTC price presented to the user fluctuates with the weighted spot rate. There are no up front costs.
Coinlock acts as an intermediary, but does not have access to the unencrypted content, and as little information as possible about the users. I personally believe in  Privacy protection, and I am taking every step I can to ensure it.
The hope is that we will earn enough trust that people start using the service to sell content, since its a new and easy way to do so, made possible by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-07 04:17:54
Oh I see. Just to be clear that is the price defined for the file, and its pegged to that currency. So it tries to determine the purchase price based on the weighted spot rate at the time of the transaction such that it approximates the value of the pegged currency.
@_date: 2013-08-08 00:59:34
I think people are concerned that Chrome calls home in ways that Firefox does not, and that information can be used to reveal information about the user. Just like anything though defense in depth is necessary to maintain anonymity, even tor browser should be sandboxed as demonstrated by the recent freedom hosting exploit.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:10:38
I just had a bunch of trouble with localstorage. Honestly when I started hitting major issues there I punted it since I was under the impression the support might not be there. As numerous people have pointed out it is, although I'm not sure of its status in Tor Browser bundle... I'm going to have to give it a deeper look.
