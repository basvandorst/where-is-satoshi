@_date: 2016-04-28 21:39:00
I'm not.  You were just thinking in too small of a scope.  It can't be considered an alternative until it can be an alternative for everybody in every way.  
@_date: 2016-04-28 13:18:33
Ehh, you kind of are in 2016.  You'd rather have all, uninsured cash? You're going to buy prepaid gift cards every time you need to pay a bill? Watch those fees rack up quickly.  You're definitely coerced into keeping your money in a bank.  
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:47:17
Nobody else is reading this conversation anymore.  Don't play dumb.  Who gives a fuck.
This is why bitcoin is not an alternative yet.
If banking disappeared tomorrow, bitcoin would have a really hard time continuing.
The opposite is not true.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:02:58
You're correct, but to say Bitcoin is an alternative to banking is delusional.  It can and will be (or the next crypto).  But not now.  Its better for us to embrace a symbiosis between banking and bitcoin if we hope for bitcoin to survive.
@_date: 2016-04-28 22:04:01
What I said is that its not an alternative to banking.
And its not.  Period.  The fact that your underemployed, uneducated friends can live off the grid doesn't mean that its an alternative.  It means they are the exception.  And I envy them.  However, All you did was find a loophole in my statement.  Which is petty and absurd.  The fact is that bitcoin cannot be effectively used for the vast majority and therefor is not alternative.

Except no.  You are not obliged to keep your money on Coinbase - in fact, you're not very sharp if you do.  Buy it, move it.  Use a tumbler if you're concerned about Coinbase trying to track where you send your money.  Companies like Coinbase are 100% necessary in mass adoption.  If the average person cannot easily obtain Bitcoin, how do you expect bitcoin to become the norm?

@_date: 2016-04-28 20:20:51
First, we were talking about the alternatives to banking.
Second, you're wrong.  Coinbase is insured against their loss of coins (not if you fuck up, which is almost no different than a real bank).
Third, 97% of their coins are stored offline. They only keep 3% on hand to pay out instant withdrawals.

@_date: 2016-04-28 17:11:14
This is a false leak to deter their use.  Nothing will be able to completely stop the audit trail, but tumblers clean your coins.  When you send them coins, they are then forwarded from a cold wallet that isn't connected to your wallet, or the wallet the tumbler used.

Listen, your post is bullshit.  Your embellishment of Coinbase's fees discredit you.  Your belief that this currency "won't make it" because it takes "2 hours to send payment" is actually retarded.  Regardless if takes 2 hours to send payment, that's still days quicker than a credit or debit card payment.  Do you think merchants have immediate access to CC payments in stores? They don't.  CC payments go through in batches, 2-3 times a week.  
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:34:32
Weird, I buy my coins on GDAX from other users and send them to my Coinbase wallet.  My coins are mine.  Mt. Gox wasn't in anyway insured.  Mt. Gox had a criminal owner from the start.  Mt. Gox is an utterly horrible example of an exchange.  
I'm not concerned.  And when its time to be concerned, I will be.  But for now, there's no value in not having your coin protected by a registered, regulated business.  
I've made enough profit from BTC since 2011 that I almost can't lose money even in a catastrophic meltdown.

You can still spend "unconfirmed" BTC.  The BTC still goes to the merchant instantly.  The fact that your "merchant" hasn't received it yet tells me its a DNM account. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:21:24
It doesn't matter.  Coinbase is insured.  Further, they keep less than 2% of their holdings online.  Enable 2FA and your coins are plenty safe.

Edit: Payments are instant.  Receiving money to your DNM account is not. ;)
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:01:10
He's lying anyway.  $25 debit card purchase on Coinbase is 75 cents in purchase fees, not 3 dollars.  I've never once sent more than 10 cents in transaction fees, and when I send that high of a fee, I get confirmations within 1, maybe 2 blocks.

Communism is a form of government that also controls the economy.  Again, government bad.  Ideally, blockchain could create a decentralized world, leading to either anarcho-capitalsm or anarcho-communism. I'd imagine the majority of the world would lean toward anarcho-communism given the chance. Either way, government in the overarching form we currently see needs to go.
@_date: 2019-10-29 10:46:02

Rather than recognizing that not everybody has the means to cross legally, you'd rather kick them back immediately.  Rather than being American and welcoming those less fortunate, you want to push them behind a wall of bureaucracy and bullshit.  All most of these people know, who don't even speak English and have no means to learn it, is that there is something better on the otherside.  And you want, without discretion, to shut them out.

This isn't really true for everybody.  Tell that to kids in Chicago ghettos who have no textbooks to take home, whose parents are drug dealers or crackheads.  Opportunity is only there for people who are shown it.  There are plenty of vulnerable people who are never given opportunity.   If you're poor with good, hard working parents, you have a shot.  If you're poor, in the ghetto, with no family to guide you, you're absolutely fucked.

Irony.  You know you used the term liberals as an insult, yet, here you are crying about being insulted.  I know you used the term liberals as an insult because you read a post that would clearly label me as libertarian, yet you needed to use a divisive word fed to you by divisive media.


This isn't even remotely the same.  You're somehow equating a nation with a home.  Its not the same.  If someone knocked on my door in clear distress, I wouldn't turn them away.  I may not let them in, but I'd find them help.  A wall shuts those people out entirely.  You're telling people to go around.  People who may be immediately suffering; who may be seeking refuge from cartel dominated areas; people who just need to get a foot in the door, and you're literally trying to tell them to fuck off because they don't have the means or understanding of how to get here any other way.  Its your privilege; because you understand that there may be a better path here, people who are totally poor, with no understanding of the language, who desperate to escape should somehow also understand that path.  You're making this cold hearted decision that they have the time to figure out how to escape a desperate situation any other way.  You hide behind this idea that "if they did it legally, its totally fine" ignoring the fact that the people desperate enough to uproot everything, pack a bag, and trek possibly hundreds of miles for a better life may have no other options.  You hide behind that idea that some of these people may be shitty people.  So all must be fucked.

The more you issue stock, the lower the price goes.  If a company is worth 1 million dollars and issues 1 million shares, shares are $1.  If they issue another million shares, their value does not increase, and shares go down to 50 cents each.  You can not repeat this process over and over and expect your stock to continue to have appeal.  The reasons for issuing new stock are not equivalent to the reasons for dividing Bitcoin. Comparing stock to bitcoin is "disingenuous and misleading". 
I didn't say that dividing Bitcoin increases the price.  I said that if we are dividing bitcoin, that likely means the price is increasing.
If I can buy A with 1 Bitcoin, and the price of Bitcoin doubles, I can now buy 2A with 1 bitcoin, or A is worth .5 Bitcoin.  Dividing bitcoin indicates the price is increasing.

Realistically, it cannot be infinitely divided.  And it has the opposite effect anyway.  When you issue more shares to a company, share price falls.  On the other hand, as we divide bitcoin more, its likely that the price is *increasing*.

This is also illegal.  You can't stack transactions.  
Edit: I do know personally that Wells Fargo was notorious for this back in like 2008.

What are you talking about?
Bitcoin's value is entirely speculative.  Thus, when an economy/currency is in trouble, Bitcoin becomes viable.  At the moment, the cheapest/fastest way to send money out of Puerto Rico is Bitcoin.  Paypal no longer operates there.
It goes beyond just a fear of currency collapse.  Right now, Moldova is in chaos.  20,000 people protesting because 1.5billion disappeared from 3 banks.  What's worse then your money losing value? *It not being there*.  People in Greece rushed to convert money into Bitcoin, so much so that exchanges were lifting fees.
When there is legitimate concern that your Government may actually take money from its Citizens to protect itself, those citizens will do anything to keep their money.  Bitcoin is one of those ways.

While I agree with you, you're getting such backlash because there was no reason for you to even post.  You could have just reported it.  You had to be snooty though.  That's all.
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:01:53


This is only because of accessibility.  But if you give a country that lives under an oppressive regime the *option* between that Government's currency and Bitcoin, they will choose bitcoin time and time again.  
The biggest surges in Bitcoin's value come after economic turmoil.  Cyprus, Greece, Puerto Rico, soon Brazil and Venezuela.
Edit:  we are in a global economy now.  there is plenty of ways to utilize Bitcoin even if your local economy collapses.  you aren't thinking broad enough.

So sue them.  You'd win.  Its blatantly illegal.  Thus I don't really believe you lol
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:21:18
Don't answer shit based on new regulations.  They can't backdate a regulation.  It doesn't apply to anything you've done.  
If it suddenly becomes illegal to cut down trees, the paper industry wouldn't be on the hook for the last few hundred years.
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:19:04
Wait, what exactly am I *arguing in favor of*? I'm just saying this thread is bullshit, the meme is a lie, you're all fools if you're accepting the charges that people are saying they've gotten within the last couple of years.  That's all I'm saying. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 01:20:34
So *sue*.  
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:21:11
By getting a lawyer who can pull the transaction times via a warrant.  They've been sued and lost for it already man.
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:47:01
That's when you explain that Coinbase will automatically convert into USD, if they so choose.. but if they want to continue to give 4% to Visa instead of 1% to Coinbase...
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:18:52
Then you're a god damn pushover with no spine.  You can't bitch about it if you won't do anything about it.  Grow a pair.  I don't know what to tell you people besides you're part of the problem.  A lawyer would eat this up.  There's zero time or effort required on your part besides a consultation, that's the beauty of a lawyer - they do all the work.  Its a slam dunk case as simple as pulling transaction times and fee schedules.  
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:13:01
Long term trend seems like it will be parity. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:16:09
Sue them then. TD got sued for millions of dollars for it. 
Edit: night have been Wells Fargo first. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:58:31
That's ridiculous.  Its your responsibility to know how much money you have in your account.  They incur a fee for charge backs.  Now, as I stated in the thread, it is illegal for this scenario.  Can't charge an overdraft fee due to a fee over drafting you.  
Most of the time, the transaction does decline.  They cannot, however, prevent ACH transactions from going through, which is usually the cause of an overdraft. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:55:55
You're probably a joy to be around eh
@_date: 2016-10-22 08:37:24
Its entirely illegal to charge an overdraft fee when it was a bank fee that put you into the negative. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:40:03
I think there is/was a Blockchain issue communicating with APIs.  Maybe your transaction history is dependent on Electrums API communicating with the Blockchain? 
Edit: I'm not extremely techy, so please don't pitchfork if this is dumb lol
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:05:39
Steam takes bitcoin, does it not?
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:02:26
I'm on 30 minutes no confirmations going into Blockchain wallet from Coinbase and no transactions for either wallet on the Blockchain yet.
@_date: 2016-05-23 05:46:14
Can also lobby your local small businesses to accept it.  I talked my local thrift store into it :D
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:56:41
Its just going remarkably slow. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:03:48
Is this the hold up on my transaction? :) 30 minutes, no confirmations.  So your API isn't communicating with the network?
First time making a purchase in months, got a little scared there for a second that I messed up!
Edit: We're good! Thank you, @_date: 2016-10-24 16:06:55
Why is it so hard for you not to overdraft your account? You can double spend on Bitcoin, its not impervious to 'overdrafts'. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:32:21
Australia sounds like a terrible country, really.  Almost fascist. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:56:44
Bitfinex raises a billion dollars, price skyrockets. Lol

Every central bank is the same bank. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:08:38


If you're not paying taxes, you're not legit.  That's all.
I'm not going deeper in this conversation, I'm not secure in anyway.  Cheers for pioneering. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:01:18


Show me your tax returns.  Otherwise, you're a fucking liar lol
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:04:55
I'm disputing the legit part.
Anyway, your proof shows 2008.  TOR has been around since 2002, and DNMs have been around since then.  You weren't first.
