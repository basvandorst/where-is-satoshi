It's important to recognize the difference between the idea and the execution of an idea...
Similar things may have been done before, but Apple tends to pull of execution. Partnerships, ease-of-use and uniqueness are things I think Apple will have going for it.
It would be awesome if we could write more interesting Passbook Passes... Preload a 0.1 BTC wallet with a change address built-in as a Passbook Pass... When a merchant charges us, we can use it, they get their funds and the rest is sent to the change address. Keep multiple passes, in various denominations, like keeping bills in a wallet.
It's the beginning of a platform. I hope. And one day could be used to circumvent the payment processors.

"People disagree about spelling it 'check' vs. 'cheque', but at least we can all agree that it will be nice when we can stop using the word entirely."

If they were able to succeed with such gems as the DMCA and Patriot Act, then imagine what they can do with something that isn't terrible? Bitcoin will replace the US fiat system by the end of the week... *crosses fingers*

This is exactly what the next steps are for my project ( once I get AuxPoW implemented... A simple, zero-dependency DNS server, easy to run on your computer that downloads and maintains a minimal copy of the namecoin database. Non-.bit domains get forwarded to your regularly scheduled DNS. Suggestions welcome. :)

You could also set up your router to use your computer as its DNS server. Then everything connected to your router would just work, regardless of OS, as it is "just another DNS server". :)
I am curious why it won't work with Windows though... If you find any details, pass them along...

Nope... It seemed promising for a while, they wanted my logs and screenshots... But after I sent them in, nothing else... I've e-mailed them a few more times to no avail...

Thanks! My first changetip, ever...
Due to Dogecoin's upcoming fork, auxpow has become a priority, which means namecoin will also be supported.
Checkpoints and primer files are low-hanging fruit though...
