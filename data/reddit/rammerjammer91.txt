No, besides the fact that both are finite, you can't compare them.  Gold has real value AND perceived value.  Gold is extremely malleable and ductile, and it does not oxidize/rust.  It's melting point is almost 2000 degrees fahrenheit.  It can actually be put to practical use and will therefore always have at least SOME value.
I'm not a crypto hater.  I've been hodling 55 litecoins at 3 bitcoins for about 2 months and clearly it's paid off, but let's not confuse real value with perceived value.

Bro what??? seriously?  lol.  you just lost any credibility you possibly could've had before.  Of course everyone would be building their cars out of gold if it didn't cost a fortune.  holy wow you need to start from scratch... it has me nervous that I'm bullish on something that you are also bullish on.  just wow...

Correct that copper is used in many more ways than gold is, but only because of it's low, low price.  if gold was as cheap as copper it would be used far more often.

You need to be somewhat honest and realistic with yourself.  If gold ever got that cheap then the gov't would build our rail system out of gold and wouldn't replace a single line of track for the next 1,000 years.  The demand for gold would never let it drop to that low of a price unless one day we magically stumbled upon millions of pounds of it and there was an insane amount of new supply flooding the market.

lolz nice copout.  what you said is seriously one of the dumber things I've had to read though.  It was kinda painful.  Clearly you have your narrative, but peppering in some facts here and there shouldn't hurt you as badly as it does.

I can't tell if this is sarcasm or ignorance.
You don't really think copper or silver is more expensive than gold, right?

I agree with about half of this.  Of course people by gold because it is a good store of value, but why is that?  Why don't people by aluminum or steel instead of gold?  It is absolutely the characteristics of gold mentioned in my previous comment that makes it such a great store of value.
I wouldn't hate on bitcoin because of it's volatility.  Look at the volatility in the spot price of gold for the first 10 years after the U.S. was taken off of the gold standard.  It took almost a decade for it somewhat stabilize as people got a better grasp of what it was actually worth.  Sure there's still the occasional drastic movement in price, but they're few and far between.
Before we can compare bitcoin to gold, we need hard proof that bitcoin is in fact by far the best crypto out there.  Thousands of cryptos are in their price discovery phase and the only reason I really think bitcoin has the best shot at being the leading crypto a decade from today is because it was first to market and I have to think the most merchants will be setup to accept it as payment.  Just like people have settled on gold and platinum being the easy  and  metals for industrial and personal purposes, people will settle on a crypto or two or eight, and which cryptos those are remains to be seen.
