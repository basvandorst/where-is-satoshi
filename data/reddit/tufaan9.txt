Thank you!  Found it, but man it required some digging. 
For anyone else interested:
Select “other bank” from the list of institutions. Then enter routing/account info.  Then they’ll proceed with the deposit verification process.

I had actually decided not to buy because of Coinbase. I’ve “verified my identity” 3 times, to include the selfie, bank info, etc.  At this point I’m flashing back to a girl I knew who played hard-to-get so hardcore that I moved on, only to hear “why did you give up?”  Damn, if you’re that much trouble up front, I’m nervous about how you’ll treat me once you’ve “got me.”
Thanks for the alternative options... and thanks OP for reading my mind.

I’m not questioning account verification - that makes sense to me.  It was just crazy to me to see *how* they wanted to do it.  After asking for my account name, password, and PIN, my security question was next.  It’s all good now, I found the alternate verification process.

It seems to violate every cyber security article I’ve ever read... but then how is everyone finding their purchases?  Are people just charging in anyway, or is there some other path forward?

Any chance you have a screen shot of that conversation?  I’m reasonably intelligent and don’t mind doing research, but most of the info I’ve seen thus far is focused on explaining what Bitcoin *is* and not so much a step-by-step how to buy and how the component parts function (I’m particularly concerned about the warnings I’ve seen regarding wallets and addresses, and this has kept me from pulling the trigger).  I want to understand it well enough to be able to explain it to someone.
