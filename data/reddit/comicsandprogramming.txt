In hindsight you could say this about absolutely anything.
You realize a lot of people were in the process of buying or selling BTC just like everyone does at any exchange?  Nothing they could have done to avoid it.
Also many innocent people who weren't tech savvy enough to move their coins and were still figuring it out.
Sorry but if you want Bitcoin to adopt you can't just tell people they're stupid for losing money.  We need to hold those responsible accountable.

BTC is a currency that we want regular people using...you can't just expect everyone to be an up to date expert trader...

Sure!  We actually have a network of websites but we're in the process of merging them.  Here's the main furry one that accept Bitcoins that I was referencing: 
Sorry if it's a little bugging we've been stripping it for the move.

I work in the adult comic industry and we sometimes publish furry comics (anthropomorphic people) and we frequently get taking down by banks and payment processors for distributing "bestiality."
It's pretty far from it obviously but the payment processor can remove our whole catalog at their discretion for ONE thing we produce that they don't like with no warning.  It's ironic too since the furry stuff is far more tame than a lot of the stuff they do allow and it gets the fewest charge backs and complaints.
We live in constant stress that we're going to wake up one day and have one of our processors bail on us and freeze our money (which has happened before).  We have to pay multiple processors huge liability fees ($1000+ a year + 10 - 20% off of each transaction) and make sure all their plugins and stuff are all up to date in case we need to fall back on one.
We process less than 1% of our sales in Bitcoins but we really hope it grows.

We paid for consulting (quite a bit of money) which spent months trying to negotiate with payment processors and the $1000 and ~20% off each transaction is by far the best we could find.
We are a decently sized company too with a good amount of transactions so we get certain breaks.  As an individual I imagine paying 20 - 30% is the norm.

No sorry we pretty strictly do not deal with that type of content at the moment.  We already get enough flak for what we do have so we are trying to avoid doubling up (e.g. no rape, violence, etc) since a single payment processor dropping us could mean all of us being out of a job.
In the future we are trying to create a platform for our artists where they can sell anything (as long as it's legal) with as little oversight from us as possible.  Check back often and you should see updates on this!

We've been feeling it out and are planning on a big campaign for it soon but we actually use BitPay and don't want to draw too much attention to ourselves just yet since they also don't deal with adult content :/
We are working on a new site and will definitely get a new Bitcoin solution then for sure start advertising huge discounts.
Thanks for the tip!

We will be doing that for sure when we move all our sites to a new system.  Right now we have a ton of small sites and no way to give discounts based off payment easily and don't want to do a ton of work that's just going to be scraped for the new system.

I don't get how this is greed?
If you Googled how to buy Bitcoin back then Mt.Gox would be one of the first results and was a largely recommended exchange.
There's a ton of people who just wanted to buy Bitcoin and got stuck in the mess.  And loads of people who bought a long time ago and were using Mt.Gox as a wallet because they aren't tech savvy.  Or businesses using Mt.Gox's Bitcoin API.
Not everyone has the luxury to make Bitcoin/money their life.  Even if you read up on Bitcoin news weekly you could have easily missed the signs or not understood them.
I'm just saying this could have happened to any exchange.  It wasn't super apparent.  People hated Mt.Gox for having majority control of BTC exchange and that was really all the bad news you'd hear about them as an average user.  The USD freeze people blamed on Dwolla too and Mt.Gox claimed to be covering that.
I get you're trying to rationalize this as some super obvious thing that you could avoid by being up to date, but it wasn't.  This kind of thing could easily happen to you or me or the most tech savvy Bitcoin user.
