I paid some dude with a satanic shrine on a bitcoin streaming site 2 BTC for giving me a giggle. Most I have ever spent on a creepy video feed.

I'm still kicking myself for not buying at $4.8, so I think I'll hold off until/if the price dips and buy a sizable amount. What's the minimum investment for your fund? I have about 5 coins sitting around that would probably be better off invested. Don't know if that's enough or not, but let me know.

Very awesome, I just found out about this. Can't wait to invest.

I'll be home at about 3:30PM EST, just so you can plan ahead. If you're not on for whatever reason, next week would work too.

Sweet, I'll message you when I can get in front of my bitcoin server and see exactly how much I have. You'll be on later tonight, right?

Great info, thanks. 
It's funny how you recommend me links then tell me bitcoinica is like burning cash. Multiple personalities much? Why do you dislike bitcoinica? Is it the speculation aspect?

I've already invested in a couple bitcoin pools based on glbse, and I'm doing quite well (7% return in the first week). I want to get into bitcoinica because I like the volatility. You can make a shit ton of money or lose a shit ton, all in the same day.

This is a fantastic idea. I remember there being a few shitty bitcoin based servers a couple months ago but they had no real structure, and terrible administration.
I could see a well managed bitcoin based minecraft server with solid rules and boundaries doing quite well. Perhaps make the whole economy based on bitcoins and have a 'wilderness' area/half of the map for bitcoin based PvP. I could see it being pretty vanilla, but maybe have house/single chest protection available for sale via BTC. Not too much or else it would get unbalanced for the rich people/early adopters.
Nice flashy website, yet simple and elegant at the same time. The site could easily be built up on a Node.js server and cloud hosted for cheap. I have had great experience with NFOservers for minecraft server hosting in the past, they're quite cheap comparatively, and quite fast. Integrate some sort of a wallet system in the site so people can deposit/withdraw coins. Perhaps have multiple skill levels, so people that want to gamble a bit more can bet larger amounts. Or arenas where people can compete for large amounts (&gt;.01 BTC).
I'm a techy by hobby, javascript developer for work, and have a bunch of experience creating minecraft servers (I was a mod on a major minecraft server for a year before creating my own server that lasted for ~6 months, and had 200 active players at it's peak.) I would love to help out with this project if you're looking for people. I could bring some great ideas forward. PM me if you're interested.
