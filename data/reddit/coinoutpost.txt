Give us a chance.  Use code "thnxreddit" and get 10% off.  I can't convince you any other way.  I guess I could get on my normal account and pretend to be a customer, but that's not how we want to do business.  Thanks for considering us, and I understand the hesitation.

During regular business hours CST usually less than an hour.  But we say within 24 hours just in case we get a bit overwhelmed.

Unfortunately, I can't prove a negative, but the few testimonials we have are real.  We included LTC, but to be honest, what we have in LTC we are going to hold onto, since they've nearly quadrupled in about a week.  Once we get the process operating as efficient as possible, we will be looking at adding various other alt coins.  As for payment methods, credit cards seemed to be the most requested, we added western union to allow customers to purchase larger amount and protect ourselves.  We will be adding OKPAY and probably PayPal, as soon as we can get that running without our PayPal accounts being frozen.

To be honest, I believe strongly in BitCoins and want to propagate it to more mainstream people.  The more available they are to mainstream people, the sooner large retailers will accept them.  That's good for all of us. To answer your question, I've accepted making Bitcoins more available kind of a personal mission, and will adjust prices to make up for the costs of operating.   Our profit margin is fairly small, upsell charges primarily go to labor and fees.

Check us out at  . We offer micro denominations of 0.01 bitcoins to let people get started in bitcoins without having to drop a ton of money. We do limit new customers to 0.1 BTC per completely processed transaction on a credit card, but offer toll free western union transfers to purchase larger denominations.  If you want larger denominations we do offer discounts for larger amounts via western union payments.

We fight it, we offer transactional history of the transfers in the form of log files, the request made by the customer, the terms and conditions of our site, IP geolocational, proxy information of the customer.  Actually, we usually win that battle, but it is a struggle.

Because requested, it is CoinOutpost.com,  but I really didn't start this AMA as an ad.

Also, judging by your history of posts, you seem to already have a raging discust for bit coins.  Which begs the question: If you firmly believe bit coins to be a failing endeavor why spend so much time and effort slandering them?

Nothing I could say could convince you otherwise, so I won't try, but I understand your disbelief.  Probably, more then most.

Our site prices are formula based and update with the market every 10 mins.  Funding just requires scraping some cash together.  I had the luck of buying a couple hundred bucks worth back when they were $11 a piece, which helps.

Unfortunately, not at this time.  Paypal is not very supportive of Bitcoins yet.  Hopefully, they will change their tune before too long.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:59:10
That's actually an excellent idea.  We will have to look into that...

Thanks for the feedback.  We just have a basic OpenCart template.  I'm not great with code, just dabble a bit.  But I'll see what I can do.

Generally speaking, fraud detection automatically detects this and auto-denies the transaction.  Otherwise, it usually doesn't process at all as the owner of the card has usually called the creditor and reported it stolen.
