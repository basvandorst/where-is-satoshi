Exactly, it's many uses are what has made it so valuable for thousands of years, and why IMO it will remain valuable for centuries to come.

Bitcoin is divisible by 8... There are 8 decimal places...
So, I could buy something that costs 0.00010000BTC or, the label would just say, 10,000 Satoshi...

Well, if they burnt most of their money, it might actually help their over-inflation problem /s.

If we needed, it is possible to add more denominations, right? Or would that mean a hard fork?
Also possible, is to adjust the halving rate, and the BTC per block, so instead of 12.5 right now, we would go to 16, and increase the time between halvings, of course this would *definitely* require a hard fork.
Alas, it will be in the far future, if ever, that we would need to do this.

How do we know the last one will be mined in 2140? Does bitcoin dynamically change the block reward to be sure of this? I thought it just halves every so many blocks, and there is no way for the block reward to change otherwise?

I'm just speaking on a historical basis. Gold and other rare-earth metals have been considered valuable long before currency was invented. Largely because it was useful(ductile, doesn't oxidize much, is recognizable, and as a currency in snd of itself, it's fungible, and scarcity means that it doesn't have lots of inflation).
I would imagine that long after an economic collapse, it will still be useful, for the same reasons it's been useful throughout history.

Gold will still be worth something... Clean water, food and fuel will also be worth something...
If I bought $1 million worth of diesel or gasoline right now, and the economy collapsed, the dollars I spent wouldn't be worth anything anymore, but my fuel would quadruple in value.....

But, even if the network went down before a difficulty retarget, if you were the *only* person mining, eventually you would get the whole block reward. Now of course, if would still take a horrendous amount of time to get to whatever block the difficulty retargets at.

If mining network went to zero, could you not just fire up a few of those ancient USB miners, a powered USB hub, and get to work mining. I know that's what I would do....

Well, in my country, our government has been shut down for an entire month now.... Over a wall....

Now you can mine Bitcoins with free electricity, generated on your own roof! And do it while charging your car from that same electricity(assuming you have an EV)
