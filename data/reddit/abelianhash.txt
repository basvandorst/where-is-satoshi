Well, I don't see myself running a full node for LN. And I would define myself as a top 1% person in hardware and software knowledge.
So in the end everyone will continue running some sort of SPV clients.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:54:27
I doubt that LN would decrease the number of on-chain transactions.
Currently bitcoin is only used as store of value. So all the transaction to open/close LN channels would be on top of the current transaction load.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:39:03
What I am missing is the section about "risks, challenges and problems" with LN. 
Looks like some happy propaganda in the current state.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:13:09
How would that help? Opening multiple channels would also increase transaction size and cost more.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:54:29
The only thing that could spoil bitcoin from becoming mainstream is the arrogance of the technical literate towards the technical illiterate. 
In my eyes one reason why there is no widely used linux/gnu.

You mean dropping bitcoin dominance from long years of &gt;90% down to 30% is not running it against a wall?

Global warming is supported by scientific evidence.
Whether or whether not LN will find adoption is a gamble.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:27:55
Yeah, just funny that it is nearly invisible here in this forum. Makes me wonder why.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:17:48


It is not ready for professionals either. It is still not clear whether routing in the LN can be done efficient and decentralized.
And just opening a channel between two parties has very limited applications.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:01:49
This is not how grammar works.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:24:42


No. You will spend more on electricity and hardware depreciation than what you generate as mining profit.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:37:57
Routing not solved, centralization risks, legal implications for nodes, ddos attacks on nodes, etc...
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:39:57
Looks like scam and is supported by bitcoin core developers.
Same type of propaganda like antbleed. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:55:45
Link not working + nobody ever claimed that LN is about individual channels. Thus the name lightning **network**.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:16:54
Objective criticism of LN has been removed for a long time from this forum. Even more concerning that the mods (OP) contribute to the brainwashing and manipulation.
Would have been easy enough to show that LN is not entirely centralized without this manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:59:09
Yes, the artificially high fees and lack of scaling destroy many use cases and merchant adoption.

Marketcap is the number of coins times the current price.
Unfortunately there are some cryptocurrencies with a quite undefined number of coins.
This could be because large numbers of coins are lost or cannot be traded because they are in the hands of a few developers/companies/individuals.

It indicates that half of them are lucky. Exactly what you would expect from intrinsically random and chaotic movements like in stock markets.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:04:48
Segwit just increases transaction volume by 70% with normal transaction patterns. 4x increase is only possible with artificially engineered transactions that are not be seen in the wild.
And Schnorr is just another 25% if I remember correctly.

I am always curious about people like you. I guess it is like with homeopathy and magnetic wristbands.

@_date: 2018-01-23 22:02:48
Sure... make two arbitrarily complicated trading systems. Statistically one of them will end up making gains.
The problem is that stupid people will be convinced that the system worked. Similar to the homeopathic pill that surely worked for my brother's boyfriends' dog.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:56:32
Looking at the dominance of bitcoin and seeing it falling from ~90% to less than 35% within the last year makes this rather questionable.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:33:50
Your link also states 2x increase. More recent evaluation shows that it would be rather 1.7x with full adoption.

No, they show the same vision-lacking and anti-user attitude that killed many open-source projects in the past.

What a toxic community. No wonder that more and more businesses are leaving bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:52:56
That might work 5 years into the future in case Schnorr signatures are implemented. But it also sounds like an unrealistic technological overkill for a simple problem.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:06:42
With average transaction fees of 30 USD and assuming already quite steep fees of 2%, this would only be useful for payments &gt;1500 USD.
But I guess we do not need to record every used car sale on the blockchain. It is just for banks.

@_date: 2018-01-27 08:37:40
The problem is that core developers rather let bitcoin run against a wall than supporting onchain scaling. So for now we are stuck.

Happens to the best of us.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:53:16


That is a general misconception. Currently nobody uses bitcoin for transactions besides to and from exchanges. 
All transactions to open and close LN channels would be on top of the amount of current transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:46:49
Great for the governments would be some sort of public ledger in which you can look up money flow.
This is difficult to do with cash.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:56:58
Well. This could also be seen negatively as bitcoin being a dinosaur that is unable to evolve. We will see whether LN will find adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:41:48


Why would anyone run a full node in the first layer if you just need it once a year to open a LN channel?

Can we also start a petition for bitcoin core to implement segwit in their GUI and for change addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:04:41
Not sure whether these comparisons are useful.
You could claim that bcash is implementing multicore processors while bitcoin core is waiting for quantum computers.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:57:17
Yeah, better don't get information from multiple sources. Always stay comfortable and cozy.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:42:19
Even Schnorr and Segwit together would just double the transaction volume (assuming full adoption).
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:26:00
Yes, bitcoin is a store of value. It is not supposed to be transfered unless more than 10,000 USD (0.3% fees).

Are you an actual person or some shill account?
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:49:26
I will just leave this here (bitcoin fees have still been less than 2 USD in Oct): 
Not sure whether you are delusional or really thinking that anyone would use bitcoin with merchants with current fees.
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:56:48
The main problem with bitcoin is that it cannot be spent anymore because of high fees and decreasing merchant adoption.
This is a very dangerous situation. Currently it just requires to shut down a handful of exchanges to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:41:14
Quite unfortunate that all the problems of LNs are not mentioned.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:37:19
Bitcoin urgently needs a certain degree of on-chain scaling as intermediate solution. This process needs to get started now in order to allow for a ~1 year planning phase.
With further intentional crippling of bitcoin by core to push solutions that will not work within the next 3 years I am afraid that bitcoin will be abandoned by the majority of crypto users.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:32:43


These would be the most centralized ones.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:27:05


I don't think the problem is that people don't have the guts.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:36:43

@_date: 2018-01-26 19:00:46
Shhht. We don't want this information to be public.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:06:23

Of course we can just talk about a happy world with butterflies. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:04:21


Then why all the fighting about segwit adoption if the softfork is about leaving the choice to people?

Should we blame it on uneducated users?

In this case however it would not make economical sense to get paid in bitcoin if you can only spend it with high fees.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:48:04


Exactly, by scamming people to believe into it. Same for homeopathy and magnetic wristbands.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:20:53
And at the same time, bitcoin market domination goes down and merchants are fleeing.
Bitcoin had more merchant adoption 3 years ago. No ways anymore to spend bitcoin besides centralized exchanges. The current bitcoin core team is a desaster for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:14:01
You are wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:55:29


Lol... not even core implemented segwit in their GUI because of good reasons. 
Lots of problems with compatibility of addresses and most airdrops are not working with segwit addresses.

@_date: 2018-01-18 22:43:18
Exactly, LN might facilitate thousands of **additional** transactions that nobody is doing today because bitcoin can be only used as store of value.
Again, the managing of LN channels would come certainly on top of the current transaction load.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:54:59
Thanks, I prefer reading horoscopes than wasting my time with technical analysis scams.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:29:59


This shows how important it is to maximize the number of merchants that directly accept bitcoin.
Unfortunately the decisions of core have led to a strong decline in merchant adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:43:25
Yawn... you sell people into technical analysis so you can predict what they are doing and front-run them. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:28:35


That's quite some understatement. You need to download a specialized wallet and connect to other LN nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:14:51
From coffee to retail to big purchases to personal investments? 
So we end up with a settlement layer for banks?!
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:45:10
Ok, let me explain again very slowly:
Nearly the whole current transaction load is between exchanges and people's cold storage. This transaction load will not go away with LN (because it would be stupid to use a LN channel for cold storage).
Thus LN channel management will be on top of the current load. Even if it is just one channel per person per life.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:16:15
You're welcome.

@_date: 2018-01-05 18:11:06

@_date: 2018-01-09 23:48:43
Use cases removed, decreasing merchant adoption. It is painful for me to see the bitcoin carrot shrinking.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:56:17
and pay 50 usd to open a channel?
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:04:53

@_date: 2018-01-08 19:45:50
Not sure who he would bitch-slap.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:33:03
Same for quantum computers. They are already here and just wait to work reliable and gain adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:26:54
Well, I applaud you for doing this for idealistic reasons. But it does not make economical sense.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:35:16


Wow, are we re-writing history? The majority of the miners wanted to scale bitcoin to keep it useful as currency. 
Bitcoin core developers were fighting against on-chain scaling in order to push off-chain solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:37:57


No. Users and nodes will not simply open new channels because on-chain transactions are expensive. This is why testnet is not a good comparison. Moreover, the channels need to be well funded in order to manage large amounts of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:25:44


Any background on this?
If people start opening LN channels on top of the current transaction load, fees will rise even higher.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:51:31
If people just transact with 5-10 exchanges it is certainly not decentralised.  We need merchant adoption. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:47:41

If you are willing to overpay the fees much more, it might get faster because people put more hashrate online.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:38:07
I guess the rest of the network could block such an attack by ignoring the double block from btc.top by relying on being able to grow the chain faster.
Interesting question whether this is done.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:05:39
Schnorr is expected to reduce network load by 25%. Not sure how this is visionary. And it will probably take &gt;3 years to implement assuming the same problems with consensus in the community we have seen in the past.

@_date: 2018-01-24 08:19:11
Yawn. So in short you believe that a system influenced by millions of random people does not behave chaotic and past behavior influences the future.
As stated before,  if there were no trading fees you have a 50% chance that your strategy works. Same if you ask a monkey to pick trades.

@_date: 2018-01-27 14:18:39
Of course &gt;90% of them still hold bitcoin. Nobody in their right mind would change to a minority chain.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:27:07
Good example how important it is to have as many merchants as possible accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:49:52
How can this be a serious argument? The solution is that people need to turn away from bitcoin to make it usable?!
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:22:44
A LN that is actually used requires much more transactions than the current state of bitcoin (in which nobody does transactions besides to-and-from exchanges).
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:35:54
In other words: how to lose ~20k usd by peeling off a sticker.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:26:23
ddos attacks on nodes that are monitoring a channel cannot be simple "routed around". It puts users funds at risk.
I am not saying this cannot be solved but it is definitely a problem.
Anyway, it feels like a useful discussion is unwanted here.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:34:32
Your link is from October last year. No merchant with product costs under 1000 GBP could viably use bitcoin with &gt;10 USD fees.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:35:37


All serious studies show 70%-80% increase.
Schnorr would add another 25%.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:01:22
Of course it will not disappear. But it might be irrelevant and people turn to a better developed alternative.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:40:52
Apparently not. Even most 3rd world countries have internet with unlimited bandwidth for less than the costs of two bitcoin transactions 1 months ago.
