There is one specific reference implementation.

It's fraud to convince people 2009-2015 that Bitcoin has cheap and instant transactions, when in 2017 it didn't.

Which one is closer to the original Bitcoin design for scale of 2009-2015? Hint: SegWit and Lightning are recent divergences.

No, $20 minimum. The blocks are supposed to be full, to support the miners and fee market. We got a taste in December of Bitcoin working at its best.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:14:34
For $20+ to settle a channel.

Chapter 3. Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation
By Andreas M. Antonopoulos 
Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the bitcoin system, meaning that it is the authoritative reference on how each part of the technology should be implemented.

I am a professional firmware engineer, for medical and secure devices, with a decade of experience. Secure code is simple code. (You added the "You aren't a dev, I can tell.")
Segwit is not voluntary. There is no way to opt out.
Since 2009, storage computation and bandwidth per cost have increased 16x. Exponential growth.

Nah, verifying the blockchain lets you trust the system.
Mining is competition for issuing money, and fixing the history under a computational burden.

Lighting Day  A zero-day attack on the Linux kernel takes the internet by storm. Everyone's channels are vulnerable - open channel (hot wallets) are scraped clean in minutes. The mempool is overfilled with transactions moving the stolen bitcoins. RBF is disabled in these transactions.
Call it a spam attack, but when everyone needs to close their channels, very few will be able to settle up.
Guess we just, stop the economy for a few days and everyone's money is gone? Pool's closed.

Here's a much less complicated transaction malleability fix:  
No blockweight, no new block datastructures, no witness and signature sections, no new protocols to pass SegWit data etc.

The blocks must never be full. 32 MB in May, 1 GB this year.

Like SegWit and Lightning. Yikes!

That's what fixing the history means.

Bitcoin is a store of value, not a currency.
Hey, you can't use another currency!

Read what I wrote, it's not what you quote. 
Here's an example of how secure code must be simple code:

Secure code is simple code. This project is worth the global monetary base. 
Computation, storage, and bandwidth all naturally grow exponentially, that's all the scaling that we need:  
Simple: faster internet, more CPU, etc.
Hard: Backwards compatible kludge hack code.
Voluntary: Hard fork
Involuntary: Soft fork

Will do. It should always work, despite malice. This lead to the "spam transactions" crisis of November and December.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:44:57
Yes, it's much less complex to accept larger blocks, then to change transaction data structure entirely. SegWit is a shitty hack.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:09:13
Lighting's claim-to-fame is that it solves Bitcoin's problems, and would be necessary to use Bitcoin. Its complexity counts.
