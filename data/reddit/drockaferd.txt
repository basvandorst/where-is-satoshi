So are these sites P2P with a middleman? Because that’s ideal (and how it’s suppose to work in the first place). But I don’t know a ton about these other sites so I’m skeptical to trust them

That actually does make me feel better. Piece of mind knowing there are people with more at stake than me

Will bitcoin ever hit a steady price or will companies like coinbase always have a place in the market?
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:26:54
When all bitcoins are mined and some have a lot and some have none, how are we going to share them all? Goods and services?
When all are mined, will we still have websites like Coinbase where you can buy bitcoin?
How will taxes affect bitcoin in the future?

All set my friend. A very interesting topic!
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:24:19
It does, thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:33:12
Cash app is much better than Coinbase. Much lower fees and I’m pretty sure it can be used to quickly send bitcoin.

I have the downloaded application on my PC. I’m also in the US so I don’t really use the internet for Ledger Live
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:11:14
That’s the answer I’m looking for, thank you! Another (ignorant) question about ledger live: is there any chance that software could be hacked, allowing them access to my trezor if I plug it in? Or is it part of the blockchain? Sorry, I know these are kind of noob questions
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:00:43
Yea the "Ledger Live" which is Trezor's interface. I also just realized I can't send from there, only receive. So that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-20 13:18:27
Okay that makes a lot more sense. Although I can use the mobile app to send bitcoin which seems pretty easy already? Granted I have to type in my password but it still seems easy. Do mobile wallets allow you to send without a password or anything?
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:28:16
I’m so fkin stupid my god. Yes I have a ledger, not a trezor lmao
@_date: 2019-02-01 01:38:29
Thank you, I needed that
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:46:48
Thanks!! So a block is a group of transactions. What’s a node?
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:13:20
How would building credit work in a bitcoin world? Or taking out a loan? Will Bitcoin becomes the world currency or will it be supplemented with government currencies?
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:12:02
Okay so is the blockchain made of nodes of blocks?
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:28:42
Okay great! Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:36:12
Just saw a post about bitcoin halving, and read that its when the blocks left are cut in half or something? Can you explain what that means, what blocks are, and how they relate to mining bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:47:57
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:13:14
It would make sense that getting Bitcoin in circulation would help so that’s what I’m trying to do. I will say, holding ain’t too bad either
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:57:39
I will always try and spend it wherever I can. Just not a lot of places to do that. I know that the best thing I could do is spend it and I really want to, it’s just hard
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:26:05
How so?
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:48:51
Doesn’t it feel good? Not really caring about price?
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:34:43
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:43:27
I like that
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:42:17
Maybe, idk
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:02:01
So I have my bitcoin in a ledger. Is the there an app that I can connect my wallet to and spend from there?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:04:52
How do I spend my Bitcoin? I have a ledger nano s with my bitcoin (or keys or nodes, whatever they are so there's another side question), but do I have to transfer those out of my wallet before spending them? Like do I have to put them into coinbase or another service before spending them, or is there a way for me to take them right out of my ledger into another persons ledger?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:26:21
Ohhhhh no. If you withdraw your bitcoin and make money, you’ll get hit with the capital gains tax. I’m not an expert but I do know it gets taxed. Although if you’re a long term hodler, you’ll never need to withdraw it, you’ll spend it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:41:49
Correct
