At the moment you have to be quite a "gambler" to consider doing so simply based on the evidence of the price charts and the fact we are more than 50% below the ATH. If volatility does decrease then perhaps this will be more attractive but I think we will have to see a good several month period of lowish volatility in order to attract the more risk averse investors. 
Unfortunately the volatility is, IMHO, contributed to greatly by the speculators, day-traders, and so on who now see bitcoin as a money making opportunity. This is a positive feedback loop, the greater the volatility the more potential profit in trading. 
Is there any way the volatility can be reduced ? Will the extra liquidity introduced by products such as bitfinex swaps make matters worse or better ? Can the introduction of ETFs help to smooth out the current wide swings ? It seems impossible to judge these issues right now but maybe things will be clearer by the end of the year.

I interpreted the OPs question as a general one about the future utility of bitcoin as a store of value. I was not interpreting it with regard to any individual making a decision to buy into it now. My point about mentioning the 50% below ATH figure was to illustrate the extreme volatility and highlight the poor performance for "store of value" as the value has effectively more than halved in 8-9 months.
Whether it is better for an individual to buy at any figure 50%, 90%, or whatever, is a question I will leave for another time as i don't think that was the intention of the OP.

Seems fair, it does have a higher probability of going down rather than up over the next week or 2 we reckon simply based on the charts. As always any interesting news could provoke a strong reaction either way. As they say in China "May you live in interesting times" !!

Some people may have always seen bitcoin as a money making opportunity but I do not think everyone does. Certainly I see no evidence of Satoshi, Hal Finney or Nick Szabo mentioning such a point (correct me if I have missed it please).

On what evidence or theory do you base that statement ?
