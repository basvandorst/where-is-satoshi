You do realise the equivalent of bitcoin during during the dotcom crash would have been Cisco which was the largest company in the space at over $500bn.
Cisco crashed to something like $150bn
Cisco is now valued at under $100bn.
Post - fail.

I agree with it being current 'over-valued' for it's current use cases. However, i also think there is a huge amount of hype around btc and obviously other coins, much of which comes from people without a decent understanding of the potential 'issues' that are present and may arise in the future. If for eg. things like the coming forks don't go as smoothly as hoped, i can see a lot of money being scared out of bitcoin. 
In saying that, if bitcoin realises its future potential, i think it is still very undervalued regardless of it's current 'valuation'.

Yeah it makes you question what it would take for there to be a serious and prolonged regression in price. I think a large hack which hints at stability/security of the protocol (although it seems unlikely atm) or a larger global recession of some sort where money is desperately needed elsewhere might be about the only instances. Outside of that, like you said, i think the 'dips' may be largely consumed by new money.
