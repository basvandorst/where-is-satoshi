I agree if the price stays at $400 the next halving will make the price jump, because this means that adoption is at the same rate of inflation. If that is the case the price will at least double.

This is an easy kill. MasterCard failed to do any real research on this.
-Trusted, trust is a critical component
Bitcoin is secured by mathematics.
-Bitcoin doesn't really serve a clear purpose
Its a means of storing value.
-Bitcoin is looking to guarantee 'anonymity'
Its not.
-MasterCard uses electronic cash to combat inefficiencies &amp; create transparent &amp; inclusive financial system (What appeal does cryptocurrency gives when its anonymous by electronifying cash?)
the blockchain is infinitely more efficient then MasterCards systems, no to mention its 100% audit able by anyone
-Innovation is critical to maintain a healthy environment for consumers and consumers (safe, simple, smart)
Innovation for credit processors, this has to be a joke right? consumer protections are paper thin with credit processors 
-85% of the retail transaction of the world is in cash (we are trying to get more people to adopt electronic payments)
And it will not stop any time soon either.
-Bitcoin goes against what we establish in our business in the move towards e-Cash. In terms of transparency, security and security
Yes it threatens their profit margins. Again credit card security is a joke.
-Cash facilitate anonymity, illegal activity, tax avoidance, &amp; inefficient
yes, yes, corporate tax dodging is the real problem, yes.
-Cryptocurrency is 'manufactured' on anonymous computer &amp; at anonymous location. (** a concern)
He is making it sound like Bitcoiner's are cooking crack or something.
-Regulators wants to understand who makes the payment, who receives the payment in order to control the payment. (Bitcoin anonymous = no)
The blockchain say who makes the payment and who receives it.

I think its going to be extremely hard for the IRS to prove you held the coins for any amount of time. I am guessing the IRS will get a lot of long term cap gains.

What if your keeping funds in a non us exchange. All of the coins are being mixed, and the us government will have to subpoena the information from the exchange at that point to prove fraud.

Stupid KYC laws make them have to get these documents to prove the customer is who they say they are, and banks require tax id's... So choose your evil.

Hasn't every one of their units been months late? You would have thought people would have stopped dealing with them once the jalapeno came nearly 10 months late.

Cant tell if serious or just doesn't understand.

The Bitcoin network is small peanuts, i would expect real hacker to start going for the banks and the rest of the financial sector. Quantum computing will stand to disrupt the entire internet.

As an other public servant I think the fact you used you're former title reduces your legitimacy as a creditable supporter. Your trying to use your position as a mean of legitimizing your due diligence, and that is disgusting.
