Yeah, I actually made a account for Coinbase however I got stopped when they asked for ID etc... So when I tried to remove my account again I couldn't beacuse the needed to verify by ID that it was in-fact me trying to remove my account, but there were no ID attached to my Coinbase account, luckily the issue is resolved now :)
