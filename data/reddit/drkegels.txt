Calm down.

I'm moving some money into campbx. I've heard only good things.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:54:06
Hey, I'm in that montage! I feel special.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:53
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:02:54
I jumped on the gravy train expecting to bail as soon as things stopped rising. That has all changed. I believe!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:23
Holding here.

Definitely backfintentional.

When someone asks about bitcoin and how to learn more, I am sending them here lol.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:44:36
I'm am 1000% certain it will be at at least $1,000 within 10 minutes of mtgox coming online.

Use "x-spend"
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:01:42
We are all bitcoinbillionaire. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:24:12
There are very few opportunities to be part of anything that develops this quickly. We get to witness dramatic change in very short time frame. It is beautiful.

Merchants can offer products cheaper because of the smaller transaction costs.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:35:23
I'm in.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:48:56
I am stoked for whatever happens.

Me too.
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:25:44
People were so sure of themselves. I did'nt know people were saying tulip mania back then also... lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:57:43
I'm holding.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:28:27
I am doing the same thing except I only have 5.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:20:54
Definitely No, and Yes.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:15:15
Are you making money day trading?
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:45:37
Redistribution. I've heard a lot of concerns over the concentration of wealth for early adopters. This was excellent!
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:51:39
Feelings are great, just be careful how you interpret them.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:04:12
I am tempted. I feel like I will just fail. A lot of smart people are doing it, and they will take my money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:26:06
will go up and stabalize
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:12:23
Go away
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:56:56
This is great, hopefully. I do I know if your service is legit or you are trying to scam?
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:22:49
I am inspired to do the same. I will wield my bitcoin chalk without remorse.
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:37:36
Anemone5, some of your phrasing perfectly sums up ideas I've struggled to articulate for a long time. If I had a bunch of BTC, I would tip you.
@_date: 2013-05-09 06:58:42
Here you go: 
This is some serious mining software. For Athiests and Anarcho-Capitalists only.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:02:01
This is great. I like that some 0-14 years olds are buying BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:28:50
Do you mean:  
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:13:01
Yes, I think it will go back up....or it will fail and be worth nothing. I vote for option 1.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:48:25
I 4th this motion.
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:25:19
haha well done. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:16:56
FUDsters go home.
