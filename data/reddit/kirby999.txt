If people start getting paid in bitcoins, there is no tax on that. If people keep pensions in bitcoins, there is no tax in that. If people send bitcoins as they use money to each other, which will be very possible when the technology catches up, the government gets no tax whatsoever. Society may not be able to handle the collapse caused by no money for any governments around the world. Speculations great and all but all I know is the future will be very interesting concerning bitcoins.

Switched on the mining rig, came downstairs for breakfast and saw the weekly magazine on the table. Being wishful I give it a glance to see if bitcoin might have made an appearance...let me know if you guys want pictures of the article itself.

So you reckon sell around late afternoon (USA time i assume) and then buy back in a day later? I'd be inclined to agree, just look at [bitcoinwisdom]( this is more than just adoption growth, this is a "bubble", however much I hate that word.

This guy gets it. 100%. It's about the future. If you sell now, you will kick yourself for not holding just like the guys who bought and traded 10,000s of bitcoins back when there was no market for it. Pay back some debt, but try to keep some or even most of your net worth in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:20:46
Yeah but that was due to slow deployment of next gen chips, this might move the price up, I just bought one share and will see where it goes over a year or two.
