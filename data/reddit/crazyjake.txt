Only problem is that Ohio liquor law says transactions have to be in USA, so half the places participating in the project can't actually sell you anything as they are bars. And when I tried to go to the one restaurant there, the guy that knew how to run the Bitcoin app on the register wasn't there. Thus was a few weeks ago, so any word on if liquor law advisory from the state Board has been handed down or if staff have finally been trained on clicking buttons yet?

As a chase customer, I do indeed feel upset about this, but not surprised. I am so tired of giving my information to anyone online to use their websites. I want openID and other federated logins and data management systems to be more widely supported

Not much here. There is a chance this might slightly help adoption, but I would be much more impressed/interested if they functioned as an exchange to add competition to the coinbase/bitpay/etc markets.

"oooh no! There goes Tokyo! Go go Bitcoin!"

In just curious. What the hell did everyone think dogecoin was for or how it was useful in any way? 
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:33:33
I would be much more excited if they had become an exchange, rather than consolidating more transactions through coinbase...

Me too. Help! I should never have been given super glue!

With the recent grief over on being only the latest in a long history of PayPal stealing people's money, this is a campaign I can get behind.

Very true, I was thinking the same thing =/

I was just looking into Bitcoin backed debit cards, and was looking at xapo and coin kite. Coin kites site looks like it is much more geared towards businesses, can it be used as just a normal consumer? Pros and cons of xapo, coin kite, other Bitcoin debit cards?

Thanks! Great advice is worth at least an upvote @_date: 2015-03-12 02:44:36
Warning, spoilers! 
What about the second foundation, supposedly established at the far opposite end of the galaxy? At the end of the series, it's reveled that they were actually established on the same planet, but in psychology, the other end of the spectrum from the hard sciences of math and Engineering which has the reader follows (or so it is presented to the feasers). It is discovered that this relatively small group has spent the last 1000 years pulling the strings and guiding the development of civilisation, basically by pointing the scientists in the 'right' direction and letting then go, and then keeping them on course. 
Wouldn't this translate into some small group hiding within the Bitcoin community directing it's growth and direction, setting their own agenda? 
Also, is this a thought exercise, a proposal for a rewrite/fan fiction using Bitcoin and the economy in place of the galactic empire, or a fun /showerthought? :)

Several of us in our store use Bitcoin, but I doubt we'll see it adopted for a while simply because of the amount of returns we do.

This should go in @_date: 2013-12-13 16:16:22
Thanks honey! You've saved me money in the past and are the only discount coupon tool I would ever recommend. (DIAF coupons.com!) I would certainly use this service, and only ask that you consider using both the coinbase and bitpay APIs to further ease the checkout process :-)

The blockchain Facebook feed has been implying a major announcement this coming week, likely some new features or something...

Holy balls I can't believe that scanned. Guess I'll send a tip..

A Wikimedia installation would likely not suit a long term website design, but it would go some way in making edits, reviews, and ratings more open and transparent.
Can we build on an idea like this?
