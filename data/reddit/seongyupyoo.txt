The users and the network create the intrinsic value. Why was whatsapp sold for billions? Great technology. Anyone can make a copy, but why didn't Facebook, Google, Microsoft just make their own copy then? It's the users and the brand. Bitcoin is that brand, and we are the users, and we own it.

I was thinking P2P as in Person-To-Person, but I see.
Well, it may not be pareto-optimal, but it is the best outcome for each individual given what other plays are doing in such a zero-sum game.
What do you mean "high energy states"?
Yes, the USD was the primary reason for me to switch to the other way you mentioned. I initially did not know you can do that with the blockchain, but doing that is getting in the middle their transaction, and if it starts getting in the middle their transaction, it has to do that for USD as well, which means much more complication for everyone involved. This setup is risking the risk fund in the operator's hands, but it allows anything to be traded between traders. No just currencies, but maybe they can trades Butterfingers with Snickers over shipping. It  is the absolute minimum necessary to build nash equilibrium between two strangers.
So, at least you like to domain? :) I appreciate the feedback.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:24:09
Thanks, yeah, someone suggested that last time as well, but I haven't been able to find a talent capable doing such. Maybe I should give it a go. Probably better than just all text.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:31:46
At risk coins stay as long as you want to make trades. When you're done, you can take them back. It protect you through Nash equilibrium, meaning there is no benefit to the other person to just take and run with your money, but it is not a guarantee. Someone may just want to see the world burn, destroy money, and take some of your risk funds with it. It works on the basis of mutually assured destruction. See the wiki article for it.
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:40:43
How does this work?
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:11:08
Yes. I guess that's what matter, because I actually view it the same way. I never the check code, but I feel a bit safe when I know that something is open source.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:41:01
No, NASHX will not ever get in the middle of the transaction. If you wanted to send the tracking number to the buyer, you just message him the tracking through NASHX messaging. NASHX will never review that and make a judgement call. Buyers and sellers both must agree to release the funds in order for funds to be released. I guess you're point is that shipping could take longer than 7 days, and that they might not be communicating with each other for more than 7 days. I think it would be prudent to do perhaps 14 days. That's usually the return period of many online stores and ebay sellers.

@_date: 2013-05-08 14:46:29
Where did you send it to? I don't think I got it. A few people have mentioned the multi-sig approach. I agree that it would be better. It would make it so that people don't have to trust NashX to hold on to their money. We release or destroy without the ability to keep it ourselves. However, the only advantage is that it makes it so that people can trust that NashX won't run away with the risk funds. However this will advantage is only more advantageous in the beginning where trusting NashX is a problem for some people. As more people start to use it though, it will be easier for them to trust that we're not going to just run away with their risk funds. Implementing the multi-sig is not a problem, but it will take time, and it will make everything more complicated. In the end, they will still have to put trust that we haven't messed around with the multi-sig code in some way to cheat them. In the end, multi-sig still requires trust, while complicating the process. If they have to trust anyway, why bother, the result is the same in the end, and trusting NashX won't be an issue when a lot of people are trading on it. There is actually someone who wants me to take him as a 50% partner for him putting up 50 BTC into the business, and going down the path of implementing the multi-sig feature. If I see that multi-sig is a must-have feature by everyone, I will implement it, but I'm seeing based on many people who have contacted me that people are already willing to use it as is because something like it in very necessary right now. So, I want to make something quick that can used right now that works, and work on improving it, rather than going for the holy grail off the start.
@_date: 2013-08-01 05:17:51
No, so it's important to keep the deposits in NASHX only when you're making deals on NASHX.

10 charities or 100 charities is good, except you have no certainty that NashX hasn't created some of those to be bogus charity. Distributing to traders in whatever ways will give incentive to traders to make fakes account and make fake traders in attempt to get higher percentage of whatever gets distributed among the traders.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say supporting mobiles views to my website would hold me back. I fully support mobiles views. I'm one of those people who visits websites and more on mobile devices than on a computer, and I think building a mobile website that both desktop and mobile users can view is better than building a desktop website that mobile viewers have difficulty using. I consider mobile experience more important than desktop experience. It's mobile first, desktop second for me.

I think some people may have covered it already, but it is the truth, and developer is boring and too official sounding as opposed to hacker sounding more exciting and fits better with what bitcoin's potential impact. I think op is concerned with some people's negative connotations with the word hacker preventing wider adoption, but some people's rebellious side will be drawn to it in positive light as well, people fed up with the current system of money who's secretly or unconsciously wanting a revolution.

I see. I haven't been mining bitcoins as it takes too long. I do have litecoins I can sell. I don't really want to sell, but I will sell so I can see how NashX will work first hand. I'm trying to figure out best way to move USD in irreversible way as well. I just found out that even PayPal personal can be reversed, so I need to find a way, and if there isn't one, maybe it's time to make one.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:20:29
Multi-sig transactions, in order to be made on a website, will require client-side code to generate number of wallets, keys, and transactions. If we were to do this on the server-side, we would have access to everything, which defeats the purpose. But I can always slip in some malicious code in the client-side javascript too if we wanted to be malicious to get a copy of both party's pass phrases and keys, and create fake accounts, and release the funds towards fake account. The users would have to verify the minified javascript code running on the webpage to be sure that such thing is not happening. Looking at what's supposed on an open source repository doesn't really tell you what's really running on a web page. So, what I'm saying is that people will still have to trust that NashX isn't doing malicious things. Now, there are other benefits I didn't realize to using multi-sig as Spriral_Mind pointed out below. It's that nobody has to worry about the site getting hacked. That's a slightly different angle of looking at the issue of trusting NashX. It's not that they have to worry about NashX running away with the risk funds, but rather NashX getting hacked. It is possible. And it doesn't even have to be hacking. It could be a natural disaster too. All businesses carry some of this risk, but multi-sig completely relieves NashX from this risk. In any case, I'm going to start looking deeper into multi-sig now. I read your poor man's multisig, but I didn't fully understand. I don't think I'll be bothering with any shortcuts though. I would just implement the full multi-sig function.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:11:47
Thank you. It was also just too much things I have to sign up for and connecting of all the account that stopped me from trading on Mt.Gox and BTC-E, especially since I only have a few litecoins, but all of what Mt.Gox and BTC-E doesn't seem quite right in that they treat BTC like stocks. And also, even if I have many coins to exchange, I don't know if I'd be comfortable putting them at risk with either of those exchanges. I have a feeling one of them just might go down and lose all data, or get hacked in a really bad way or something. That could potentially kill Bitcoin as well. If so much fund was being held by Mt.Gox, and all of a sudden, all of it gets stolen to another account, then what happens?
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:38:14
I could do that. That would be a simple change. But at the same time, that could leave a hole where you can just keep making ton of money by constantly trading the gap between the two exchange rates, which wouldn't be possible in the real world.
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:55:26

I know. That's what I thought, and which is why I spent the time to make the program, and spent all night trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. If I feed it a good address without the checksum, it generates the correct checksum, and it passes the client, but if I feed it my own address without the checksum, and generate the checksum, it doesn't pass the client. I know it's generating the checksum correctly because I'm using what the official client is using. So what I'm saying is I did the last part of what you saying to check and I come up with the exact bitcoin address I started with, but doesn't work when I make my own in the exact same way.

I spent hours and hours trying to make a multi-sig work with both multiple 2-way txs as well as multiple 3-way txs, but they all have their advantages and disadvantages. NASHX the way it is now is the best way after taking everything I could imagine in all possible scenarios considered into account. I hope you'll trust it and try it out. I have personally felt strong need for something like NASHX, and made it the way I'd want to use it. Now the only thing is that people have to start using for everyone including me to start using.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:37:28
You're right. This still isn't a good scam though. Scammer has to risk 1 btc for a potential .5 btc return. And history helps, but yes you can cross trade with several accounts, but then if you're doing then, you're also paying NASHX fees as well as bitcoin transaction fees to build up a history, and all will amount to nothing much after one destruction.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:58:04
It seems that way, but it does not work. It's easy to generate a black hole address that looks like any other wallet addresses, but when generating a vanity black hole address, it seems you need to generate a whole lot of them and check to see if one passes.

Yes, the both the buyer and seller can blow up the box at any time. The seller puts the purchase price into the box. Buyer puts twice as much into the box. Funds are never released automatically. Both parties must agree to release for the risked funds to be released.

I don't disagree with you, that's why NashX destroys by transaction fees, but I'm still not sold on how exactly blackholing bitcoin has negative effect on bitcoin though. I used think it would, but more I thought about it, I now don't think it would. Care to clarify?

Lol. Yes. I want 100BTC for it. Who knows where this can go. Maybe it will become global craigslist for bitcoin exchanges. The site is pretty solid in terms of security. If there is any problem, it would be on the business model/logic side of it not making sense. It wouldn't be because of technical issues.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:40:59
I don't think I explained NashX very well on the about page. NashX does not hold all the funds like other sites. It just holds however you want to risk per transaction. So, if you are making 1BTC transactions 100 times, then you only need 1BTC in NashX, as opposed to in other exchanges, you have all 100 of the BTC in their hands.
It seemed like to me it was going to take couple of days for me to add money to those exchanges. And even more like 2 weeks to withdraw. I might be wrong.
I have googled, but found none. There are escrows. There are exchanges, but none like what you're saying, because I would have liked to use that. Let me know if would just tell me the name so I can go check it out. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:49:53

@_date: 2013-04-25 13:59:43
I see. Yeah, I need to do a better job of explaining what it is as it's pretty unique. It's not a traditional exchange like MTGOX. It just facilitates building trust between strangers and letting them make direct person-to-person transactions, which I think has its place.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:57:30
Yeah. You must be developer, or a tester. I just fixed it. Absoluting all values now on the serverside. Thanks :)

If a charity is the benefactor, they can effectively double their money by destroying their deals. Say they risk 1 BTC, and other party risk 1 BTC. And their deal gets destroyed, then 2 BTC goes to charity.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:54:23
I agree with you absolutely. People should treat it more like cash, but I suppose it will take time for more merchants to adopt, so that it can be used like cash more than something to invest in. It's like gold in a way in that it has limited amount. Dollar is printed and can be printed to infinity to regular value, but gold is limited earth metal, like how bitcoin is now, and why we call it mining I guess, but it will eventually run out. To be truly used like cash, perhaps it does need the ability to infinite produce/reduce like the dollar, but then who would control that, or how would the mass control that.

That was a tiny technical thing that got fixed in less than a minute.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:25:12
Well that may be the case between business-to-person but what about person-to-person? There are more options available for an individual trader to trade with another individual trader directly. In the worst case scenario, one can send cash via mail, or even a personal check, as opposed to doing something like that with a business is impossible. Much more flexibility here. Also your money is not with the exchange where many hackers are constantly trying to hack it. I think of NashX as trust providing service between two party, not necessarily an exchange. It can be used by people in any way they want to exchange something, service, physical goods, barter even.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:31:13
Sure. In that scenario, Alice is at risk because Bob just might decide to never sign the the multi-sig tx. Alice just sent her silver for nothing, and no way to get back at bob. Of course Bob doesn't get the 1 BTC either, but maybe Bob is a malicious person who likes to do such things because he doesn't have anything to lose in this case. Now let's say we add a third-party there to prevent such thing from happening, but now this third-party must be an intelligent person capable of mediating the conflict between Alice and Bob make decision as to who to favor, and because of that third-party cannot be automated with software. There is a different way to use multi-sig that perfects NashX that I have drawn in a paper in front of me now. It's beautiful and I'm now researching the challenges and steps I'll face I go into implementing it.

You're right. I could be bad and do that and I have already thought about ways to take away my incentive to do so, and that's to not keep the destroyed funds. And the solution I'm thinking about now is to distribute the destroyed funds to active traders, but I think you're idea about sending it to a charity is also a really great idea. Thanks! I also think that nobody is really ever going to destroy funds. Why would they? Also, what's Nash complain?
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:22:47
You should check  it's something I made for exactly your kind of situation. I actually just made 1st revision after a reddit review few days ago, and posted it again just now. It's right below your post under new section. No need for any personal or bank information. You directly trade person-to-person like you would do on craiglist, except on the internet.

NashX will be meet-and-greet, but folks who already want to engage in a deal with each can just use the service to make their exchange using NashX as well. So, answer is both.
The offer page is already a chat room. Once someone take the deal, you can message with them immediately on that page. 
In the latter, one of them just needs to make post, and the other just needs to take the deal. Each post/offer/deal page is a chat room, but they don't have to use the chat if they've already met each other through other mediums.

Thanks astrolabe, and I just published your picture. It's up there on the about page now. Thanks! That's a perfect representation of risk transition throughout the trade. And yes, people still have to trust and I'm not doing anything bad in my code. They can look at the browser source, who really does that? I can read code, but I've never done that on any website. I either trust them because others trust them, or I don't. That's why I didn't bother with the multi-sig, but that's not the only benefit of mult-sig. As Spiral_Mind pointed out below, there's another level to trust concerns not in regard to NashX running away with the money, but NashX getting hacked or encountering a natural disaster, at which point, the risk funds could be gone. However, with multi-sig, that's not a problem. Any fund that NashX loses through hacking or natural causes will only hurt NashX, which really awesome thing that just didn't register in my mind for a while as I guess I was focused on getting other things right first. Let's discuss your poor man's approach. I didn't fully get your methods, though I understand the full-blown method. I will send you an email.

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm the founder, and I'm here to answer any questions.
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:15:20
Yup :) If anybody is fully trusting like that with stranger, then there wouldn't be a need for NashX. You shouldn't ask the buyer to send first. The buyer has to risk twice as much risk funds. You should send first. Read the changes in revision 3, as well as look at the attached risk analysis graph. Stick to the guidelines. I've looked at almost all possibilities, putting myself in the position of a malicious trader, and this way is the only way where I couldn't do something weird.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:05:23
We currently don't take cash deposits, so in order to start trading on it, you have to have a few bitcoins or litecoins to risk. The feature is in there, and there is even a hidden section for cash risk funds, but I haven't opened it up because I'm not sure how to best handle it. The benefit of having USD risk fund is it allows bitcoin newcomers to start buying bitcoins and litecoins. The thing about USD is that it's so difficult to get them from traders in irreversible form. So far, PayPal Personal seems to be the easiest way, but a business can't ask people send money via PayPal Personal. Mailing money orders is another way, but that's a lot of manual paper handling. Let me know if you have an idea. Are you looking to buy bitcoin/litecoins with USD, but you don't have any  bitcoin/litecoins to start trading?
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:26:12
The fact it took me couple of days doesn't have an effect on the site's value, which is none at this point. When you buy/sell a business, there are many more factors to look at than just how long it took to make the site. I'm 28 years old, and I actually have started and run a successful business at  which is worth a lot more. This was my weekend project because it was fun to think about and play with something related to cryptocurrency. I don't know for certain, but the site could be worth a lot more than $10K in a year.

You know... I'm not sure. What you're saying seems about right, but I'm not that familiar with exact protocols of bitcoin. I think what you're saying is kind of doing a double-spending on purpose to lock it up? I'm not sure. Also it sounds like what you're explaining might still have the issue of whoever sending the money first or release the signature first on their locked up transaction still takes on the full risk.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:12:38
That link wasn't there in your first comment, but a few things on that page just blew my mind, especially autonomous agents and transferable virtual property.
It seemed like the protocol for escrow requires some form of dispute handling by a real person, so it seems this is something that can't be fully automated. Right?
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:56:21
NASHX doesn't care about what the buyer or the seller says to NASHX at any point during the transaction. Everything is handled and settled directly between the buyer and the seller. If one is dishonest such that two can't work it out, then both lose. If both are honest, both win.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:27:16
Why would a seller trust the buyer to release the funds after buyer gets it? Couldn't a malicious buyer hold that fund hostage for something more from the seller?

I just spent the past few days making this. I just got into Bitcoins about a week ago. I mine Litecoins. I thought about selling my Litecoins on Mt.Gox and BTC-E, but it has too much hassle. I ended up selling a Litecoin on eBay and thought there has got to be a better way to exchange cryptocurrency. Well, this is what I believe is a better way. Now, if only people start using it, I can buy/sell some coins the way I want to buy coins, which is directly and anonymously person-to-person online. Let me know what you guys think. Especially whether you think it's a good idea or not, whether you'd use it or not, and why. Thanks!

Yes, if there are 100 or 1,000 charities, it would probably work, but there will always be a tiny bit of bad incentive for those charities to something bad for their good, and managing that many charity addresses and making sure they're legitimate charities and so on, as well as making it clear to traders that they're legitimate is an issue, but what would stop me from making 100 or 1000 fake charities. True destruction is the cleanest most simple way.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:46:56
Yes, which is why I've been trying to generate vanity black hole addresses, but giving it to miners is almost like giving it to everyone because there are so many miners, and it's kind of like charity in the it's a charity for Bitcoin, but the issue comes when pool operators who keep transaction fees figure this out and start destroying deals. In the end though, as more and more people start building their reputation through transaction history, you'll know that someone isn't out to destroy deals if that person has made many deals in the past without any destruction, and you'll avoid dealing with newcomers, or charge higher prices to newcomers. I'd really like to get Vanity blackhole address generator to work, but what you're pointing out is absolutely correct, there is that incentive there, so I might have to resort to destroying it at 1bitcoineater address.

how does the redeemable code work? is it code for mtgox or btc-e?
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:33:51
That is very interesting. I did not know that. Someone else pointed out something similar, but it seemed like a mediator was a necessity, but what you're saying sounds like it can be completely automated, which is good. I was thinking about traditional sense of escrow. Perhaps this is a better way to hold money per deal. That way, NashX actually never holds on to any funds. I'm still not clear how it all work, so I will look into it in more depth later. Thank you for the help.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:45:21
There is currently no way to add USD at the moment. Only way for me to able to take USD into the system would be for me to take payments manually with money order, or PayPal personal, and I'd have to make manual adjustments to your account, so this kind of service wouldn't scale at all.
What is it that you would want to do risking USD? Couldn't you achieve the same by risking equivalent BTC or LTC?
A possible solution to allow funds is if it lets people add Bitcoins and Litecoins at a rate and give them USD credit. But then I'd suspect people would want to withdraw funds in USD, which I suspect would be more complicated than handling BTC and LTC.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:20:20
Isn't the money at the exchange at risk from attacks when you trade on mtgox/btc-e?
It also seemed like it takes a long to get funds in and out of those exchanges.
I think I was thinking my site would be more for smaller frequent trades. So like if you're making 1 btc transactions 100 times, as opposed to 100 btc transaction just one time. The fact that there no fees in a direct is another positive, though I might start charging fees for successful transaction later on if this ever gets traction.
What's the name of the exchange with automated escrow? Maybe I should try it. It sounds like it doesn't hold my funds if it is using escrow.

I'm targeting everyone. Isn't anonymous just a nice thing to have for everyone even if they don't need it? Sure I don't need it, but I don't mind it either. I think one of the cool features of bitcoin is anonymity, and I wanted to go along with that philosophy. It's cash, so let people use it like cash as if they're spending it in person was my line of thinking.
Does anybody know how to make it so that I can comment faster? I have to wait 8 minutes after each comment.
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:40:54
Yes. That's why it's been setup this way. At least 2x is required. Keep in mind though that if you were to buy 100 btc, it doesn't mean you have to risk 100 btc or 200 btc as buyer. Seller and buyer can simply risk 1 btc and 2 btc respectively, then make many small transactions, so make one hundred 1 btc transactions and cash transactions back and forth. NASHX fee is still just 1% of 1 btc and 1% of 2 btc from seller and buyer.

@_date: 2013-07-30 18:59:27
I'm not sure why buyer would ever pay again in this scenario. Buyer will either 1. get the item first, then send payment, 2. not get the item, and will have to work with seller to figure out why the buyer did not get the item and both will have to try their best to find it between themselves. 3. if item is lost in the mail, and tracking says it is lost in the mail, then it is still up to both buyer and seller to find a solution where both will be happy, otherwise, kaboom!
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:43:51
I just lowered the buy-in to 0.1 BTC
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:04:56
Yes. Hacking is an issue. We wouldn't even be a target if we weren't holding the bitcoins at all. That is a very valid point. So, there is more value to multi-sig system than just increasing the trust level in the beginning. It increases the trust level in the long run as well because there is no chance of the site getting hacked. I didn't think about this before. I don't know why because it's so simple. I guess I was more focused on the exchange logic at the time. Thanks making this clear to me. I think I will definitely go down the multi-sig route in the near future. It's peace of mind for the traders, as well as a peace of mind for me. I still hope people start using it the way it is right now. Because knowing that people will use it for certain because they're already using it will give me more energy to work on it. Donations help too. It's not the money, but it let's me know I'm not wasting my time. Thanks again for making this clear to me.

Yes. You're right. Exclusive items are important, and that's going to be what btc/ltc community needs the most right now. Selling btc/ltc to strangers online safely is just impossible at this point. NASHX provides an exclusive way to safe buy/sell btc/ltc with people you do not trust online. You only have to trust that they don't want to destroy their own money.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:33:30
Awesome! To make a post, just click post. Select a category. Select type of risk you want to take, BTC or LTC. Put in the amount to risk, and finally write a title for description of your offer. Title can be something like I want to sell 1 BTC for $150 cash deposited to my Chase bank account. And the description can into any more details about your offer if necessary.
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:51:49
Has there been anything like it?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:29:17
No, you do not need to risk 20 BTC to trade 10 BTC. You can if you want, but that's a pretty high risk. There is a better way. Risk 2 BTC to trade 10 BTC, but make sure that each time you send, you only send 1 BTC worth of USD, and I send 1 BTC, then you send 1 BTC worth of USD, then I send 1 BTC, and so on back and forth 10 times to complete a 10 BTC trade with just 2 BTC risk. And after the transaction, if you're not going to make any more trades on NashX, you can withdraw the 2 BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:59:29
I see. Seems what NashX is doing is the best possible thing for current state of community. Question is how to get people to start trading on it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:47:51
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:50:47
I can make that happen very easily if it only allows trades between and to BTC and LTC, but UDS makes making automated escrow much more difficult.
In the current setup, people can do whatever they want to make the deals directly between them.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:16:43
Perhaps a solution is the seller taking a small deposit in the transaction, and then returning it once the buyer releases the funds.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:59:04
If the buyer is at n*3 btc risk, that means the seller will be at n*2 risk when trying to extort money. So the seller would be risking destroying 2 btc of his/her own when threatening to destroy 3 btc, which isn't a very risky scam

Hi. Only my offers are up right now. 1) Both parties risk same amount. 2) who goes first doesn't matter, but it makes sense for someone who doesn't have any previous transactions to go first, since is less trustworthy. In our case if you were to take my deal, it's up to us to figure that out on our own. It really doesn't matter who goes first though, because there is no incentive to run away with the money of because of the risked funds. 3) There is that risk, and there is nothing we can do. If that person just wants to destroy his/her own money along with yours, it's destroyed. Everything is under the precondition that people don't want to throw away their money. In the future when there are people with many transaction history, you'll know that they're not that type of person. 4... just add some of my own... down the road, I am considering a way to improve the process little more while restring some freedom by specifying that offer takers must send first, at the benefit of risking half the amount. Something I have to think a little more about to make sure everything would still make sense.
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:16:28
I agree. The focus should be on things like does it work? Is everything put in places where it makes sense?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:13:20
You're right. It seems disputes cannot be opened, and payments are irreversible, but the loophole is if you pay with a credit card, you can claim with the credit card company, and they will take it back from paypal, and paypal will take it back, which makes it reversible. So it is absolutely not a safe method of payment. Should not be used. I will take it out. Any suggestions on how to do USD transactions in a completely irreversible way?
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:40:34
While risked, NASHX has full control of the money. Multi-sig was throughly considered, then dropped due to user experience issues to implement it in a way that works. 3 of 3 cannot be made to work due to not being able to tell who sent the money. 2 of 2 can be made to work, but doing so makes the process much more difficult for the user.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:33:24
Actually, they're destroying by sending the money to a blackhole address, an address that is generated from usernames of the two trading parties that is not generated from a private key. So, no one would be able to spend it. You can verify this destruction by checking the blockchain. So if you and I were in a deal that went down, you would see bitcoins being sent to an address like 1bttc1111seongyupyoWEUFSK which would be a valid address that does not have a private key.
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:22:19
Thank you. I look forward seeing some more posts, and successful transactions. I think the bitcoin community has needed something like this for a long time. I personally need it and want to use it and would like it if more people used it. I just bought a btc from someone on craigslist, just so I can actually post some more stuff with btc risk, as I've only mined ltc.
Yes, there's nothing anyone can do about someone who just want to destroy their own money while taking other's money down with them. So, it is important to review a person's historical transactions before taking their offer.
Nothing prevents a seller from risking 10 BTC for a 1 BTC item, but sellers have to keep in mind that buyers may not have that much, so requiring high risk amount reduces the potential market for the item.
Another thing to note is that the risk amount could be lower than the total value of trade. This should never be, unless item can be exchanged in smaller quantities to make up a larger quantity. For example, buying 100 btc, but buying it 1 btc at a time. Two people would only need to risk 1 btc, and 2 btc respectively, to make hundred transactions between themselves 1 btc at a time.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:23:33
That's actually a pretty good idea. I will try to think of a way. I thought about having separate leagues. 1 BTC League, 0.1 BTC League etc.

Why would't you use the funds for loans?
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:17:41
This is currently the best possible solution I'm considering right now. Only potential drawback is that the pool operators seems to take the additional transactions fees instead of sharing with the pool, so most of this money will end up in pool op's pockets. This means that few of those pool ops may start making fake accounts and destroying deals for their own self-interest, taking down this system.

Hi Reddit, This is the 2nd revision after feedback gathered from previous reddit post 2 days ago. Severals issues were raised from Reddit then.  is that traders without BTC or LTC could not start trading on it as there was no way to get BTC/LTC to start risking. This has been addressed by NashX taking Cash-At-Bank and sending BTC/LTC directly to their risk fund at BTC-E exchange rates.  is that traders with only BTC couldn't trade with traders with only LTC because they had to take risks in same currency. This has been been semi-addressed by NashX taking Cash-At-Bank and sending BTC/LTC directly to their risk fund at BTC-E exchange rates
We also thought about allowing equivalent amount of BTC or LTC to be risked, but this idea was scrapped due to the fact the market price changes constantly, and if amount of risk taken by two traders change also, Nash Equilibrium may break.  was some people wanted the ability to risk USD, but this has also been scrapped due to the fact that it is impossible to show proof of destruction, and it would be illegal to destroy USD. Also, SSL certificate has been installed, and all critical parts of the site now requires https protocol. Trust issue has been raised as to what if NashX runs away with the risked funds. We're addressing this by taking NashX under the wing of its parent company Mosaically Inc. which has been in business since 2006. (Visit  A better about page with nice inforgraphic explaining everything is simple easy-to-understand format has been raised at both release and 1st revision, and a designer is currently working on the infographic. Chat history between traders is now available for public viewing to give traders even better idea of who they're going to be dealing with before taking their offers. Overall, I'm seeing some disturbing patterns with Mt.Gox and BTC-E that seem unhealthy for Bitcoin, and some of this can be alleviated through use of NashX by the community.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:34:50
Thanks. Submitted.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:54:06
Yeah, there is no way around that, but what incentive do I have to throw away NashX for 1 BTC. But I guess if there are 100 people with 1 BTC each, maybe I'll be tempted, but at the time, then NashX will be even more valuable to me than taking 100 BTC and losing NashX. So, there is chance that I might run away with it, but unlikely as the value of having NashX will always be higher than however much funds it would be holding at any given point. More funds held for people = more value in NashX. But I see your point. I wonder if there's a way to address this.
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:47:24

That 2 BTC confirmed, so someone's actually deposited 2 BTC to start trading on NashX! That's a total of four people who have accounts with risks so funds, including myself :) NashX taking baby steps.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:36:45
Yes, if either the buyer or seller wants to destroy their own money, then they can take down other people's money with their own money. Make me think of the movie Dark Knight where Joker sets money on fire. This is why buyer can view seller's history before taking their offer. Buyers have a chance to vet sellers before taking their offer.
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:17:31
What do you mean by slide? Are you saying it should be lower or higher? BTC and LTC client's default is 6, so I figured 8 would be sufficient to against double spending.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:35:46
I'm considering and will probably do that, but as some people will know, there is really nothing to it. Someone else mentioned this earlier, but it seems all open sourcing really accomplishes give people a sense of security because in the end it is not software that they're running on their end, it's software running on my server, which means nobody can tell whether I'm running the open sourced version, or potentially malicious version.
One thing I've noticed was having been on for few hours on reddit so far is that people here really like to poke things. I've had to make two quick patches today because of people trying funny things I didn't think anyone would even bother try breaking until it got some traction.
I appreciate you think it's a good idea. Overall, I'm seeing that there are 2 big business logic issues so far. One is what to do with the destroyed fund, so that nobody has incentive to make fake accunts and destroy deals for their own benefit. The other is ability to handle large transactions in small chunks of risk somehow, so that a person wanting to do 100 BTC transaction doesn't have to risk 200 BTC, and somehow limiting risked funds to be 2BTC and having traders make 100 x 1BTC transactions between them.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:44:00
I just lowered the buy-in to 0.1 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:53:24
Yes. I think what NashX does right now is pretty good in that the risk fund is just done with BTC and LTC value. Yes there is risk that I have take it and run with it, but it's a very small amount, only as big as the largest single transaction one needs to make. Advantage of current NashX system is not because the transfer is completely handled by the traders themselves, and we only just provide an environment of Nash equiribrium, so we can actually be an exchange for ever more things. For example, NashX can potentially be used for buying something off craigslist and have them ship it. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:27:04
Thank you. Well, such a system was not possible before because you can't destroy other currencies. This was only made possible through cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and litecoin. :)

Well, yes you can destroy it, but how would you do that on the internet? Credit card payments are reversible. So that won't work. So you would need to send me cash. But then how would I show proof of destruction like how NASHX does it. If I were to burn money on video and show it to you, how would you know that it's not some fake money?
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:15:59
Sorry about that. I'm a programmer, not a designer. I'm looking for a designer to help me with the About page. It does need to presented better. I do actually like the overall UI design though. It's simple and efficient as it's mobile, but then again, I'm a fan of craigslist UI design, and you might not be. The most all websites I'll be making in the future will be mobile. I don't see a need for a mobile website, and a regular website, and it's hard to develop and maintain if they're separate. Since regular website cannot be used easily on mobile devices, while mobiles websites can easily be used on desktop devices, I go with full featured mobile websites. Yes, it's not going to be optimized for the desktop view, but I like the benefits of having unified full featured mobile site more than I dislike the fact the desktop viewers aren't getting desktop optimized view. In any case, thanks for your feedback. Two biggest things left for me to do is the About page, and multi-sig transactions.

I would only recommend this for small amounts. Use money order or cashier's check if want to be able to get the money back if the mail gets lost. Direct cash deposit is the best as long as the bank is in the area.
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:07:27
Yes, there is no way to stop someone from destroying their own money while destroying other people's money as well. That's why you can view user's history of transactions to check their reputation before taking their offer.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:41:38
Then, you do need to risk 20 BTC if you don't want to give the other party any incentive to run away with your money.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:44:47
I don't think there will be any problem making money with multi-sig transactions. The multi-transactions can have small percentage of the funds directed to our wallet. I've already worked out the logic for it and saw how it would work on paper, just not in code. I'm definitely not thinking small, but I also have another business that I'm growing and have big plans for as well, and it's a matter of priority and which plant to water. I want to water plants that are growing or showing signs of growth. I definitely think NashX can alleviate some issues with traditional exchanges, but I think that's still thinking small. I think what's really exciting is that NashX isn't just a cash exchange. As of revision 3, it can be used to trade anything. We can trade physical things, or even services using NashX. It's a system that builds trust between strangers. It has its roots in bitcoins and uses and relies on bitcoin, but doesn't have to only serve bitcoins. If it grows really big, I think it will compete with sites like eBay and Craigslist, not just Mt. Gox and BTC-e.

The site doesn't get in between two people making trades. People make trades directly with each other wallet-to-wallet. Money does not go from wallet to site to wallet. The site operator(me) could run with it, but it would only be running with small deposit added to risk into deals.
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:22:16
I thought about doing that, and few others suggested also, but that gives charities bad incentive to make fake accounts, get into deals, and destroy risked funds.

Just curious. Do you trade Bitcoins on either Mt. Gox or BTC-E? What do you use to trade, or do you not trade at all?
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:54:48
I do have another business  that could be of some use in addressing this.
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:37:38
These comments between you two are all excellent and valid points. :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:51:22
Yes, but what about a mining pool that doesn't have any miners yet. How much would that be?
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:14:58
There will never be a point where one has only risked 1 BTC, and the other has risked 10 BTC. It's always in 1:2 ratio. So, it is only possible for seller to say "If you don't give me 1 BTC, I'll destroy your 2 BTC" or "If you don't give me 2 BTC, I'll destroy your 4 BTC. The buyer would never be able to make such a demand because buyer's risk is always twice as much as the seller. The buyer however can look at a seller's history to see if this type of behavior might be expected, say from a brand new seller, then avoid an offer from a seller with no history. Also, this is a risky proposition for the scammer seller, as trying to scam this way, the scammer has to risk half the BTC just to try to run such a scam. The buyer might care more about not getting scammed, and not letting you get away with it, at the cost of losing twice as much.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:58:28
Thanks for your honesty, and thanks for raising the concern. I'll definitely put it in place if people start using it.

Make the most amount of money with $1,000,000 trading between BTC, LTC, and USD. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Maybe I went too simple.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:03:48
There is no sense of a disputing a transaction to NASHX. Any dispute claim will be made between the buyer and the seller directly, and how they handle it boils down to two choices: 1. work it out in a way both buyer and seller will be happy, or 2. destroy all risk funds. Both the buyer and seller can claim whatever they want at any point during the transaction against each other to each other. If anyone lies, they will be lying directly to the other party who has to power to decide. NASHX is never gets in the middle of your transaction, and makes judgement call. I have sold many things on ebay, and I've had so many crazy buyers, and ebay always favors them, and then essentially I'm scammed by the buyer because of the way ebay favors the buyers always.
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:54:27
This is very good understanding of how NASHX works. WIN!
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:23:47
Lol. I'm speechless, but I suppose I understand your point of view.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:05:37
Also, the way you documented would generate a random looking blackhole address, and I'm looking to generate a vanity blackhole address so that the tradres will know that it's a blackhole address. Otherwise, the address would look like any other wallet address. I could be telling them it's a blackhole address when in fact it's another wallet I made. Let me know if you have any tips for me regarding making a vanity blackhole address.
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:46:10
Traders to buy/sell for whatever they agree on at the time of trade. It's completely flexible.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:36:42
That is actually exactly what I did in C but doesn't work. It generates correct checksum and I can verify with other good addresses, but once I put my own decoded base58 string to make checksum and add so on, it gets rejected by the client. I'm assuming this is because good valid addresses were generated off of something of the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:55:36
Thank you. I appreciate that. You witnessed the site since inception! :) It's come a long way. It just needs a few people to start trading on it. I'm thinking if it doesn't get people to start trading today, I may need to do some kind of a promotion, perhaps giving away 1 ltc per person to first 100 people who makes a post or something like that.

I will look at it asap within next few hours and get back to you. Sorry about that. I'm not sure what's wrong at this point and I can't look at it now as I'm away from my desk for next 3-4 hours. But rest assured this is my highest priority now. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:59:54
Yup. That's why I tried to write a program where you can make your own vanity black hole addresses on demand, but it turns out it's a pretty difficult task. I was hoping to generate a unique black hole address for each destruction. In the end, if I see any suspicious destruction activities, I'll just black hole to one of the known addresses, which is less cool, but works in preventing any possible bad incentive.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:10:27
Do you mean for withdrawl of risk funds? I'm not sure if you understand how NashX works. NashX does not work like 
MTGOX or BTC-E. We don't handle the transactions at all. We just handle the risk.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:56:06
thanks for figuring out people might want to cash out in such a way and helping to improve the logic behind this
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:59:57
I'm thinking of turning it into a pure game. No winning. I might do that tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:14:29
Sure. Let's say you want to trade 1 BTC for 50 LTC. You only need to have 1 BTC or 50 LTC in your account in order to be in Nash equilibrium state. So, you keep 1 BTC in your account, and you can make as many 1 BTC to 50 LTC transactions as you want. So increasing the risk fund simply lets you make bigger transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:05:58
Will do.
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:31:30
Well, if I keep it, then I have a bad incentive to make fake accounts and get into deals, and just destroy deals. So people would not be able to trust the system. If the funds aren't destroyed, and are given to anyone, it gives them bad incentive to do the same. This is why risked funds must be destroyed.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:18:47
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:30:15
I just saw your offer, and saw the problem with the way things are presented on the offer page, so I just updated the offer page a little, making it more clear who's risking what, and who has to risk what to make the deal safely. Like I said below, and in revision 3, the poster needs to send first, while taking half the risk. It's the best way. If it was the other way where the deal taker takes half the risk and sends first, the poster will be at risk from malicious users who want to destroy your money and their money at twice the return. For example. You risk twice the amount because you want the taker to send first, but then I take the offer, and just destroy the deal immediately, taking joy in the fact that I lost half as much as you. This is an extreme case, but let's say something has something against you because of some previous deals or something. Then, that person will have incentive to hurt you more while hurting himself a little. That being said. You should delete your post and make a new post.
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:44:00
Thanks. It looks like you're  right now. I'm in 3rd place.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:07:03
It just occurred to me. Even if it is open source, if I wanted to be malicious, couldn't I just change the code that is running on my server? There is no guarantee that I'm running what I post as open source.
@_date: 2013-05-09 05:12:44
How does that compare with jQuery mobile? That's what I use, I haven't bothered to theme it much yet but it's easily done.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:27:09
Yes. I knew going in that gaining trust and gaining traders would be the most difficult part of this. I think explaining what's happening is also very important that's not being done well right now, because as I'm realizing as I'm talking to people here on reddit. I think people don't have trust NashX as much as they would have to trust Mt.Gox as we don't hold on to all the money. We only hold on to the maximum size of one transaction trader wants to make. So, you have have 100 BTC, but if you're okay with trading 1 BTC at a time, then only 1 BTC needs to be held at NashX. And all the transfers between the trading parties are directly between them, and NashX never gets in the middle of it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:04:47
My program generates the exact same address
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:33:04
This is a very good understanding of how it works.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:37:00
I'm not sure. They've been talking about adopting bitcoin so, we'll have to see.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:30:56
That's interesting. I haven't thought about that. That's really interesting. How might I go about finding those 100 people to put in 1 BTC each?
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:52:18
This is just for academic curiosity, could you clarify how blackholing bitcoins cause deflation because I can't see it atm. To me, blackholing just seems like the perfect tax, perfectly even redistribution of wealth, and doesn't affect the market in any negative way, if any, it'll have positive impact because everyone just got a little bit richer, except for the two whose money were blackholed. So, would that cause more money to be spent since they have more?
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:08:15
What you're describing is an escrow. If it were an escrow, NASHX would need intelligent people to review each case intelligently, which will raise up the costs, as well as open ways for people to try to scam each other by getting NASHX to favor toward their side. NASHX is better than this. Power to make the judgement is given to both buyer and seller. There is no room for a scammer to try to scam by getting NASHX to make a judgement in their favor.
@_date: 2013-07-09 15:28:58

So, that's up to User1 and User2 to decide whether PayPal is ok for their deal or not. I think PayPal Personal or their GIFT option isn't reversible, which is why I have that as one of the options.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:43:29
What about handling USD?
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:00:37
I actually have spent a whole day developing a small program that generate black hole addresses based on the protocol specified. I thought all I would need to do was attach the correct checksum, but that is not the case. byte[] decodedBase58 = Base58Encoding.Decode("16UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM"); byte[] decodedNash = new byte[decodedBase58.Length - 4]; Buffer.BlockCopy(decodedBase58, 0, decodedNash, 0, decodedBase58.Length - 4); Then I change the decodedNash with random bytes; Then reencode and generate check sum with -&gt; Base58Encoding.EncodeWithCheckSum(decodedNash); So this generates a new string with correct checksum, but when I put it into the client, it fails to validate. I'm not sure what's wrong. Some research I did online made it seem like these can be generated but only a few of them will pass, so basically you have to generate a ton of them, and test each one to see if one passes. Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'd like to know the right answer. It'd be a nice little program for everyone to have as well. Blackhole address generator if it's possible to make one.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:12:21
After a very helpful review on Reddit on 4/25, NashX received its first revision. Major change is that risked funds, when destroyed, are really destroyed now, instead of NashX keeping it, by making a small transaction with risked funds as transaction fee. This effectively removes any bad incentive NashX may have had to make fake accounts, and destroy deals on purpose. Also, it is now possible to make large trades while risking only a small amount by traders making multiple transactions back and forth in half the risk amount to make up to a single large trade. Also, user name is also revealed, so traders know who they are trading with, and how much risk funds they have, and what kind of offers they've made, and what kind of deals they've engaged. All of this information can be viewed by clicking a username.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:26:50
That's what I thought you were getting at, but I wasn't sure if that's possible. It seems like you're not 100% sure if it's possible for not either. I don't think this is a big concern though. There were couple other concerns like it, for example, a big PPS pools keep the transaction fees, so the pool operators might destroy deals maliciously for their gain. In any case, if anything doesn't work well in this area, I can very easily switch to blackholing the funds. And I can actually generate a new vanity black hole address on demand to send the destroyed funds to. However, not everybody is perceiving this to be a wise path as they think blackholing bitcoins will have a negative impact on bitcoin, and their coins, but I don't believe that. It may seem that way, I think it just increases the value of everyone's bitcoin equally. I personally think blackholing is a better way so I actually might switch to blackholing soon. But this isn't a top priority right now. I think people want the multi-sig feature more.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:55:56
Lol, no I was not lighting up on 420 just for the record. :) Why do you wonder? Because idea is so good, or so terrible?
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:40:08
PayPal Personal/Gift transactions cannot be disputed, so you'll have to make sure the you receive your money that way, and not for item/goods/services way.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:39:14
I see. That makes sense. Good thing we're not blackholing bitcoins. Perhaps that's where Litecoin comes in, to buy lower cost items not divisible by Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:49:57
Should I just go get the certificate anyways? Is that the only thing that's preventing you from making or taking an offer on the site right now?
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:45:20
Yes. You do have to have Bitcoins/Litecoins to start trading, and you cannot completely cash out like you said. I don't see a way around that, except to maybe the site doing some exchange work itself directly with people where if people have enough trust on the site to send their money to the site first, then the site could cash them out. I guess entry could work in the same way.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:17:55
The way NASHX destroys coins is detailed in the FAQ. Destruction is done by making a transaction to an made-up address without a private key. Buyers and seller know the address is made up because their usernames are incorporated in it. The transaction is in the blockchain, and anyone can see the money was sent to the made-up address with no one being able to access it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:26:03
Thanks for understanding and explaining for me sorrillo. Is there a better way to do escrow? Like in an automated fashion without an escrow person overlooking and check the transaction? If not, maybe I should make one. I think making of the offers is another aspect to this site. It's a market, not just a replacement for escrow. You could find people to trade with here (that is if it ever gets traction) as opposed to an escrow where you already had to have found someone to trade with. The market would also help set the price at the market accepted level.
Sigh. I need karma points. I have to wait 8 minutes after each comment.
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:50:50
Thank you. That's basically what I was curious about, whether it would just work like a regular DNS or not. I guess not.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:22:29
OK, I came back to my desk, and I just fixed one of the bugs. You got all your risked money back now. This happened because of the changes in risk amount from revision 2 to revision 3 for the deal taker. It's been fixed and released. I'm now looking into the withdraw bug. I have to leave in 20 minutes, so I may not be able to fix it immediately, but I will as soon as I get if now I can't get it in the next 20 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:43:14
Are you disapproving capitalization errors on the About page? Bitcoin, not BitCoin right? I just fixed it. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:55:30
With an escrow, it's person-to-escrow-to-person both ways as opposed to just person-to-person. Fees would probably be higher. But in many ways this is like escrow, but most efficient, direct and automated.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:18:43
I guess it is. I think there is ways to completely automate an escrow service as long as only dealing with BTC and LTC, but USD makes things messy. Getting USD from one party and holding it to give to another party, with potential for reversal and dealing with all different types of credit cards and payment gateways would just be a nightmare.
This type makes it so that people make direct transactions with each other, so not much exchange has to do, which makes it simple for the exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:25:02
Yup. Of course, NASHX will adopt multi-sig if and when it starts to makes sense to do so in the future. The first thing in the FAQ is the Fees section which says that NASHX takes 1% fee on all successful transactions. That's how the service is funded :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:15:21


Thanks. That seems like it might be a better place to ask.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:44:41
I'm not saying it's technical perfect, just saying that if there is a problem, the business logic would be the place of bigger concern at this point. I'm a very technical person, considering my degree in Computer Science, and making sites like this for fun, so I rarely view any technical challenges as something that's difficult handle. On the other hand, but the business logic doesn't make sense, and doesn't provide value to people, then there is no way to make that work.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:09:05
We can be the first traders on NashX. Genesis trade in a way. I'm also interested in buying BTC with USD btw.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:47:27
I prevent users from typing anything but numbers, but on the clientside, but plornt was clever enough to test in more than a regular user might use it, he entered values directly into the urls.
like I explained in the comment above, i'm not that concerned with technical challenges, as I know I can overcome them with relative ease. I'm more concerned about whether this business logic makes sense, and whether it's something people are interested in using.
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:53:14
I just made the game free.
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:49:41
I'm not sure what mean. Could you explain in detail?
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:34:19
Well, there is always risk of another person gaining access to your account with any site by brute force. I will implement this once the site gains enough traction, and if enough of those people ask for it. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:43:04
You are supposed to enter the dollar amount you want to spend, not the BTC amount you want to buy. :)
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:30:10
This provides a way to dispute directly against the seller. The seller's have been scammed by buyers for so long now. This levels the playing around online. I like buying on ebay, but I hate selling on ebay. You would use this service to get lower cost, because fees are cheapest, so the price of anything you would be will be cheaper, because ebay/paypal takes about 10%. The risk is just a risk, you get it back once everything goes well. Without a system like this, you can only deal with people you know online, because nobody would want to send their irreversible payment first.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:07:02
What do you mean put an edit at the bottom of the post? Thanks, I hope it gets some traction, so far no trades, but even today, several more big issues were identified through this post, which I'll be working on next couple of days for revision 3, by then I hope to see few trades.
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:25:40
Yeah I don't know anyone who can do that. I might just have to get on the video myself and just talk and explain the whole thing. It would be the cheapest/easiest/fastest solution, but I'm not sure how well it would turn out.
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:21:56
It would make easier life of anyone buying/selling things online. Please support its growth by trying it out and making a post. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:30:27
Oh.... you're right... That would give charities bad incentives... I think distributing it too active traders is probably best. I'm also seeing that I would need to make things a lot ore transparent, like making historical transactions viewable by everyone, just bitcoin. But at the end of the day, I will ultimately have database access, and be able to fudge things if I really wanted. This will always be the case in a centralized system. I saw some projects about distributed exchange engine, but it seemed like a big that and they're some time away.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:48:21
That is true :) though it has its downsides too. I've been there. Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:53:37
Thanks! :)
I appreciate the negative nellies for their constructive criticism. Any feedback is better than no feedack, and this way, I can improve it.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:51:56
Yes I might do that in the next revision and I might also take into account transaction fees
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:26:44
We don't destroy bitcoins, we make the smallest possible transaction with destroyed funds as the additional transaction fee. Giving it to charity is not an option. There are too many issues with that. How to know charity is legitimate, and not something NashX created on the side, and it also gives Charities bad incentive to come to NashX, make fake accounts, and destroy deals on purpose.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:53:23
This is currently under consideration as to how to handle stale. My current inclination is that if buyer or seller doesn't message each other for at X number of days, both party gets the power to just release the funds whole. I'm currently think 7 days might be best.
And thank you for your comment. I appreciate it. I do not know if licensing is something any one would be interested it, but I'm open to any who wants to work with NASHX to solve any problems NASHX can help solve. I would love to see down the line all online stores accept bitcoins through NASHX, so that both buyers and sellers will be empowered at all times.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:09:52
Yes. The risk should be twice the value of the transaction to keep that type in equilibrium. That actually sounds like should be the standard.
I think PayPal Personal/Gift is irreversible.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:42:27
Most any regular traditional banks accept cash deposits. Citibank is known to have most locations world wide. HSBC used to have many branches as also before they went bankrupt. I use Chase. How do you add money to Capital One 360 and Ally Bank?
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:44:19
Haven't gotten around to buying a certificate and installing it on the server yet. I haven't done it yet because I wasn't sure if people will start using it or not. If you tell me you'll use it, I will go buy a certificate and install it within next hour or two. It takes some time for GoDaddy to issue a certificate sometimes. It's $50 a year, and I'm not making any money with the site yet, so I'm just trying to be prudent.
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:58:26
Which is why I'm here on bitcoin reddit. To get intelligent early adopters to adopt first.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:39:43
Do you have to wait just as long? I thought standard was 6 confirmations for both ltc and btc. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:52:46
I saw some graph somewhere, where it seemed like nearly if not more than half of all bitcoins are with the two exchanges. I may be totally wrong. I hope you're right.
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:40:49
Ok, how did you do that. You are genius. I'm not sure how your haskell code works exactly, but you could tell me what you changed in plain english, because my current c# code does exactly what your old code used to do, but after the change, your code actually generates it correctly. I checked with it official client and it passes. I'm officially amazed.
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:17:08
Bitcoin risks must be matched with bitcoins, and litecoin risks must be litecoins. NASHX does not allow cross matching bitcoin and litecoin risks, exactly for the reasons you mentioned.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:44:07
Fixed. Sorry about that. I tested it myself and it's working now, and it should work for you now too. Sorry, you must have been concerned. Hope I didn't lose you as a trader. It seems like you were able to make a successful trade. Let me know if there's anything else wrong. I'll be away from my desk for about 3 hours now. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:05:02
No one can dispute anything to NASHX, and NASHX never makes a judgement call at any point during the transaction. It is completely up to the buyer and seller to make it work, or both lose.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:01:21
I feel that way about some sites as well, but I'm not sure I'd feel the same way about this site even if I wasn't the owner of it. Which part of the site is suspicious to you?
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:18:23
The problem with this is that it give the charity incentive to make fake accounts and destroy deals. Which means no more NashX
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:05:47
That's exactly what I did, and I get a good looking address, but when I try to send money to it, the client rejects it. I know for sure that it is putting the right check sum, because when I put 1bitcoineater address in, I get the same checksum. It seems that not all addresses generated this way passes the validation, and it seems thousands and thousands have to be generated to find one that works. So it seem you kind of have to mine for these vanity addresses. That is my current understanding so far after having spent a day writing a program to do it. Please let me know if you know more about this.

Thanks. Yes, it's been said that trusting NashX will be hard, especially with so many scammers who hurt the bitcoin community in the past. However, my more established business of 7 years  and I are both standing behind it as of revision 2. The thing about it is that even if I implement multi-sig, they will still need to trust that I'm not doing anything funny in the code, and they will need to check it. It's a matter of what level of trust. At least you don't have to trust a random stranger. Also, you don't have to put in 2 BTC to buy 1 BTC. You can risk as little as you want, it just makes it less convenient because you have to make many transactions back-and-forth instead of one big transaction. And yes, a truly decentralized automated exchange would be amazing, but I think that's very far away. But NashX is actually more than that. It's not limited to just trading Bitcoins and Litecoins. You can trade anything for anything. I think it has potential to make eBay and obsolete. It would be like craigslist, except not just local, but global and no need to meet the other person.

Is it too much? Would you play if it was .5 BTC?
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:33:37
I think you have 3.a) mixed up a little. 3.a) If I blow up the box, I will lose 1 btc and he will lose 2 btc. 3.b) is correct. I the seller in this situation getting scammed, could go either way. I can say this scammer is not going to win today, we're both going to die, so I destroy it all. Or I might say, I'm going to save what I can. I do not think sellers will always go for the 3.b option. I would personally have no problem doing 3.a just screw him back over. He has more to lose from the destruction. And when destroyed, both of us have lost equally. I lost 1 btc and the btc I sent. He lost 2 btc in the box.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:45:06
Hmm... Yeah I'm pretty new in this space, so I don't know all that's happened in the past, but I can imagine there must have been quite a few scammer exchanges just taking and running away with people's money. I guess what I see different about NashX is that it actually doesn't hold on people's funds like a traditional exchange, which is one of the benefits, and why there's like nothing much to look at.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:33:46
Yeah, I'm looking to generate something like 1UsernameAndUsernameDestroyed10btcjoi24ldf and based on my experience what I found out is that I can generate the correct checksum for these base58 addresses but these addresses get rejected by the client, which leads me to believe, as well as through other research, that generate a vanity address is much like mining, you have to generate thousands and thousands of them, and try them, to see if one works, because the ones that work were generated off of something valid off of the blockchain.

When coins are destroyed, their value is effectively distributed to every other existing bitcoin evenly, which is more effective than giving it to just miners and pool operators.
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:17:40
If everybody stops taking bitcoins, what value do bitcoins in my wallet have?
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:15:53
No. Both risk the same amount. It is the case that whoever sends the money first is at a higher risk in a sense that he/she has more to lose. So both might still negotiate who will send their money first, but suppose you risk 10 BTC for a 1 BTC exchange, then I doubt anybody will ever destroy that. Now that I think about it. Risking 10BTC for 1 BTC could potentially start a game chicken, where one doesn't send money after receiving it think the amount is too high of a loss for the first sender to destroy all their risked funds. Hmm...

That works, but can you imagine doing that for USD? What NashX does makes it so that NashX doesn't have to handle the money going from one party to another in any way. So, it can easily handle all types currencies. Whatever the buyer and seller wants to do is up to them. MAD is just there to make sure that neither of them have any incentive to just take the money and run.
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:25:17
Yes. NASHX was made for people like you and me. I hope more people start using it too, because I want to use it. Escrow requires an intelligent human being to manage the transaction, which raises prices. NASHX currently charges 1% fee, mostly to prevent people from building fake build up of historical transactions. But technically, NASHX is lean enough to completely run on ads if enough people use it.
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:35:13
I see. You're right about 3.a. I got mixed up.
In extremes, if it was between of broken arm, or kill us both, I would go for broken arm. However, for 5 btc, I will take I will make you lose 10 btc at the price of me losing 10 btc, rather than walk away with my 5 btc knowing took my ipad for free.
But I see you're point though. If it was 50 btc, or 500 btc, perhaps I would rather walk away. I think the level where people will be comfortable destroying risked funds to get even will be different person to person.
I still that this is not a good scam for scammers to be running. Personally, if I was scammer, I wouldn't run this scam. I have to risk way too much with too high uncertainty of return on my risk. For me to try to get scam 1 or 10 btc, I'd have to risk 2 to 20 btc.

So, PayPal is not recommended. Even payment sent as personal gift can be reversed, even after like 2 months. The fastest, most solid way, is for them to directly deposit cash into your bank account if your bank is in their area. If not, cashier's check, money order, or cash in the mail would work. But cash in the mail is at risk of getting lost. You also want to make sure you wait until you cash out your cashier's check or money order also.

I see, so I need to use btc-e. I guess this is one way to doing it. I will do some research in the next day or two to see if there are more direct options that doesn't involve another exchange, but from what I understand, you have to use another service to put into btc-e in the first place. I think Dwolla

Oh, you meant a donation! Awesome. I was wondering who it was that sent that. Thanks so much! 0.1 BTC, that's all the bitcoin I have right now. I mine some Litecoins, but not Bitcoins, so I didn't have any. Someone just deposited 2 BTC into their NashX account to start trading. It's been 30 minutes, and still zero confirmations, so I'm not sure if it's real yet though. Maybe this will be the start of people actually starting to use it. Or maybe someone trying to poke the system for security holes. Good thing it's only added to their NashX account after 8 confirmations. If this is how long it takes for Bitcoin to confirm, there is definitely a solid place in the world for Litecoins.

I think Bill's phrasing techno tour de force nails it. Charlie might be right as well. What Bill and Charlie have said don't go against each other. It's possible something really good can have a really bad impact. Bitcoin could be next big thing (what Bill's saying), and Bitcoin can bring about the end of the world (what Charlie's saying) is my take.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:28:46
I agree transaction fee is the best way, but I don't think blackholing is that bad. It's just giving a little bit of money to everyone, increasing value of every bitcoin. And it won't affect people's ability to make transactions either because a bitcoin can be divided.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:38:10

@_date: 2013-04-30 16:27:30
That's why we do it through transaction fees. Although one concern is that many pool operators keep these transactions fees, especially pps pools. On another note, blackholing doesn't have that much negative effect because it is essentially give a little bit of money to everyone, increasing value of every bitcoin out there. And it won't affect people's ability to make transactions either because a bitcoin can be divided.

@_date: 2013-05-08 18:04:55
I agree. There are pros and cons to sending to miner. You already mentioned the pros, but possible con is that it might give some bad incentives to some miners to work the system. In case the blackholing is a solid back up in case people start doing malicious things to work the system. Cool, that webpage could be used like remote client in case all the nodes my client is connected to are malicious. Thanks.

Oops, I read example 4 by accident. I read example 5 now, and I get it now. It solves who sends the money first problem. It's absolutely perfect btc to ltc exchange, but doesn't work for USD.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:07:32
Maybe there needs to be exchanged risk option, so that you can risk tiny amount of bitcoins to my 2 litecoin risk. Hmmm... this seems like a very important missing bit here. Can I add you as friend on reddit? Could we work together to make a trade in a way would would make sense for your use case scenario? It seems I must implement something so that people without any coins can start trading somehow, and people without BTC can risk BTC through LTC and USD somehow, and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:35:16
Ok, I will try.
Two people want to make a trade.
They don't trust each other to do what they're suppose to do.
So we tell them to put money into a box.
And we stick a bomb into the box.
We give each person a detonator.
Now, each person can decide to destroy the box one of them breaks trust and doesn't do what they're suppose to do.
So, even though they don't trust each, they can now make their trade trusting that they going to do what they're supposed to do because they don't want to see the box blow up.
How's that?
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:05:22
You're right and you pointed out well. Such an extreme case cannot take place. I guess I'll be even more invested in bitcoins. Countries and governments may fall but it seems bitcoins will not fall. What I meant by govs controlling it is impossible because in the end I don't have to use those exchanges if I don't want to be regulated along with them.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:52:52

Yes there is also the 1bitcoineasterdontsend address also, but I wanted to be able to generate these vanity address on demand, and I wanted to give each destruction a unique vanity address, but it turns out it's more difficult that I expected, which is probably one doesn't exist right now. There is also the question of... does no one really not own a blackhole address? It's highly unlikely someone owns those vanity blackhole address, but what if someone's wallet just came like that. Then, everybody's sending money to someone else thinking it's a blackhole. So, in the end, it's probably best to make a transaction and recycle the destroyed risk funds, that was there is absolutely no question about it. I just read the contract 5 also, I'm not sure if that would solve the "who sends the money first?" problem. Also, I'm against getting in between the traders handling their transactions for them like a traditional exchange because that would make things very difficult when it comes to handling USD. Also, there are other people who provide those services already, if they're just looking to trade BTC like stocks. NashX is more like trading on craigslist, except it's not local, but online, and trust established through Mutually Assured Destruction. But so many people mentioned multi-sig. I can't come up with a way myself how using it would solve the problem of who sends the money first. I'd like to hear a concrete solution to using multi-sig to handle that problem if anyone wants to suggest that route.

@_date: 2013-04-25 14:37:17
It just occured to me... This type of escrow still has problems with handling USD. What NashX does now, which is completely leaving it up to the traders themselves makes it easy. What NashX does right now makes it so that it can handle any currency or even anything that you might even have to ship. Not just BTC and LTC.

Ok, suppose ounce of silver is worth 1 BTC. If a guy wanted to put it up for sale on NashX, he would deposit 1 BTC to his NashX account. Then make a post offering to trade an ounce of silver for say $100. Now, in order for someone to take his offer, say a girl, she needs to risk 2 BTC. Once she take his offer. They can talk chat to arrange the details such as where to send the silver and $100. Then, he send the silver first. Now because the silver is worth 1 BTC, both have risked same amount. Once the she receives the silver, she sends her $100. Once both of them are happy, both release the risked funds. If either of them is unhappy, either of them can destroy all risked funds by both of them.

I thought giving each destruction a unique vanity blackhole address would be nice, but making a vanity blackhole address is not as easy as it seems. If you have successfully made a program that can generate a vanity blackhole address on O(1), I would be amazed.
