You mean the Swedish guy from the pirate party signed the open letter as  the CEO. It was irony.. A joke... What do you mean they own the chain? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:40
No one is bchs CEO thats ridiculous

Why fix some thing that works? Keep things simple, stay on chain

Bch was given 1:1 to all holders of btc the 1. Of August. Bch has i think 8 independent development teams compared to the one of btc.
I agree that maybe Jihan and roger may be the major mining power to run the chain at this moment, whats the big deal?

Why is it worse than tether,. Give me audits ffs
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:02
They are not ceos.. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:14:12
Erc 20 tokens can be picked up by other exchanges. Id rather hedge into gusd than tether.

I still dont get why you call them owners, chain wouldn't die if you prisoned them both.

1.28 tb doesn't sound bad. At the moment it's rather cheap getting that amount of hard-drive. When blocks actually contain 8 mb in evey single block sometime in the future. 1.28 tb will be standard in your smartphone.
Dont know why your so scared of storage problems. Seems to me like a tech that is progressing ahead of what people actually need. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:05:19
Haha whos that suposed to be? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:13:00
He wrote an open letter signed it "ceo" in quotation. How people dont get the irony is amazing. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:38:28
Tackiest thing ive seen. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 05:14:24
Why? Because the chain will grow too big for storing? Or is there another reason?
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:58:34
Haha easy to say when ur on the top looking down
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:36:36
On chain ftw

Buy the dip. Where do i buy bolivars for my btc? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:00:05
can this seriously be true ? 
I can do 20 btc transactions and i would use the same energy that i use in a entire year ! considering a 77 kwh pr transaction (which was the absoulute minimum in the article) and a yearly average of using 1600 kwh of power. Using the 215 kwh pr transaction that the article claims i could do 10 btc transactions for a years usage. 
So if i pay 5 dollar in btc transaction fee and make this times 20 transactoins that would be a 100 dollars for a years worth of energy. 
How can this be profitable for a miner then ? i need to call my power suplier.

Which btc chain will lightning network be used for? Cash, gold or core? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:35:18
My mind is BLOWN by the power cost of each transaction. I see this as the potential fall of btc. 6-7 transactions and use the same power as i use in my household a whole year, that is insane!. 
Yes Beforehand i have only thought about price aswell, until this article. People should be worried about scaling to the mainstream. coin is dead if power consumption increase, its already at a ridicoules level.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:37:08
I guess i shouldnt compare the with the price i get from my electrical company in scandinavia. It is still a "fuck you mother earth" amount of energy used pr transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:40:27
Which btc fork is the lightning network for? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:42:42
So now everyone from mt gox has been paid now? And who will get the remaining 140k coins?? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:02:36
Who is this 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:43:20
Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings will repay creditors in Japanese Yen at a price around USD400 per bitcoin (the price set by the court) and it has been reported will leave Karpelès with the bulk of the wealth left over from the difference after the creditors are repaid and the market price today, leaving Karpelès with nearly 2 billion US dollars (based upon Bitcoin prices around $15000).[35]
