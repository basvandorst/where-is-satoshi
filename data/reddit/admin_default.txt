This is shaping up to be one hell of an autumn.
- Fidelity is expected to launch out of beta to their broader clientele.
- Bakkt also plans to launch out of beta in Q3.
- And with a little luck, Chinese exchanges will be opened back up to the majority of the 1.4 billion population.
All that on top of the already rosy first half we saw with:
- Square Cash App launched Bitcoin sending, withdrawing, depositing, buying and selling to their 16 million users.
- Spedn app went live, enable Bitcoin purchases at millions of retail outlets.
- Coinbase launched debit card for crypto payments (limited to UK for now)
- Strong support for Bitcoin from members of Congress and a few presidential candidates
By 2020, we should have:
- Square enables merchant terminal direct Bitcoin purchases (4 million merchants)
- Goldman Sachs launches Bitcoin custody to compete with Fidelity
- US SEC approves first Bitcoin ETFs
- Coinbase debit card available to US and Europe
- CME, NASDAQ, SGX, DBG follow Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt service in launching competing Bitcoin custody solutions.
- World Peace ✌️
Throw in the upcoming halvening and we will blow right past the moon.

If you made significant capital gains as many people have, it’s reasonable to be taxed on those when making purchases. 
On the flip side, you can also claim a tax loss on bitcoin if the price declined.
Bitcoin can’t and won’t be treated as a privileged asset or a privileged currency that’s somehow exempt from taxes.  That would introduce a host of other problems.

It’s conceptually very simple - big transactions are settled and secured on the main chain (layer 1) every 10 minutes. Small transactions are settled on second layers instantly before being aggregated into large transactions to be settled on the main chain.
For example, the bitcoin ledger won’t keep a permanent record of every coffee you buy, but it might log all the coffees sold by a coffee shop in a day.
Payment processors like Coinbase, Square, and Spedn already scale it similarly (albeit, in a centralized way). They record all the buys and sells for a set period of time and then execute the orders in aggregate.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:08:11
Yes. Cost of production matters, but actual usage and adoption are more important. Bitcoin is valuable because it provides *real* utility that nothing else does.
Unlike gold, the rate that new bitcoin is produced is steady regardless of the number of miners. This is drastically different from other commodities, where miners can simply decrease production if the price isn’t high enough.
Stock to flow as it is used by bitcoin speculators states that a S/F ratio of 62 directly leads to a $7,500,000 trillion market cap. Why? Because gold has 62 S/F and it’s market cap is that high.
Correlation does not equal causation.

Yes, I agree with your point and OPEC is a great example. 
I think this is the crux: the amount held in stockpiles doesn’t really matter. If, somehow, 50% of the stockpiles of gold disappeared, the cost to produce 1 ounce is still $1000 and producers would still be willing to sell it for a profit at $1400. In this scenario, flow effectively doubles relative to stock but the price stayed the same. After all, even though half the stock disappeared, it wasn’t needed... it was just sitting in national vaults unused. The current demand for new gold is what matters.

I’m quite tired of hearing this analogy of “Bitcoin is one website, blockchain is the entire internet”. That’s not how it works. You can’t have a blockchain without a native cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is the native currency of the largest blockchain.
1. The native cryptocurrency of a blockchain creates the economic incentives that motivate participants in a network to act as intended. Without this incentive, there is no blockchain, there is just a database with some time stamps - like a basic Excel spreadsheet.
2. Blockchains require sufficient scale and distribution to create stability, security and liquidity. Anyone can copy the Bitcoin code and create a new blockchain, but to rival the Bitcoin network requires an even larger network of miners, merchants, infrastructure and investors.
3. At most, only a handful of blockchains can ever achieve sufficient scale and distribution to be useful mediums of exchange. Similar to how the US Dollar is a stable currency because it is a widely used currency, Bitcoin is the most stable blockchain because it is the biggest. This is a virtuous cycle where the bigger the blockchain network, the more reliable it is and the more reliable it is, the bigger it will grow.
Bitcoin is the foundation of a blockchain based internet upon which other second-layer chains can be secured. Right now, Bitcoin is an application, in the future, it will be a layer built on top of the internet and underpinning the entire financial infrastructure of the internet.

It’s not about difficulty to produce. It’s about balancing supply and demand to ensure profit.
Cost to produce an ounce of gold is $1000. Spot price is $1400. So it’s profitable. They could ramp up production rate but this would saturate the market, driving prices down. So to remain profitable, they limit production, not because it’s hard but because they can only sell a limited amount for $1400 without saturating the market.
This is the same as any produce of commodities - OPEC and De Beers diamonds are examples.

Well, here are some props and positive vibes.
Taking out a manageable loan to invest can be a perfectly rational investment decision. Bitcoin is not an all-or-nothing lottery ticket or a casino. It is a rapidly growing industry that’s attracting billions of dollars of investments not just in coins but also in infrastructure - hard assets like real estate, mining rigs and clean power generators. Much of that growth is funded by debt and business loans.
Many people, like the development teams working on Lighting and Core, have dedicated years of their careers to make this happen - often with no backup plan and very little salary.
So while it feels like a risk, many other intelligent people are taking even bigger risk.

I’ve never bought into the “stock to flow” metric. It’s derived from precious metal and commodity analysis. Bitcoin is different.
For example, after 5 more halvenings (20 years) the stock to flow (S/F) rating for Bitcoin is like 1600 vs golds 62. The S/F charts project Bitcoin would be worth more than all wealth on planet earth (hint: that’s impossible). 
So what does the stock to flow to price correlation actually mean? It’s simply the amount people are willing to pay to create a new unit of a commodity (e.g. the cost to mine an ounce of gold) vs the price of buying a unit from a someone else’s stockpile. It’s not surprising that an ounce of gold costs about $1000 to mine and sells for about $1400 per ounce. If the cost suddenly dropped to $500, the price per ounce would drop with it, regardless of the “stock to flow”. 
“Stock to flow” confuses correlation with causation. Price of metals does correlate to S/F, but S/F alone does not cause the price to be what it is.

Of course, if anyone bought more than they could afford at the ATH, I understand if they couldn’t invest more. But I know many people who could have easily bought 10x as many coins on the dip as they did at the ATH.
@_date: 2019-07-30 04:09:05
S2F just isn’t a useful metric because it shows correlation without causation.
If you want to know the *cause* of S2F and precious metal prices, look at simple supply and demand. Gold miners have the ability to produce more gold than they currently do. But if they do that, they would oversaturate the market.  So they limit production to ensure a high price. 
The low flow of gold relative to the stockpile is actually *caused* by the high price of gold. Not the other way around.

Income tax is like a network fee for operating your career in the American business ecosystem. There’s nothing wrong with paying a fee to support vital infrastructure that’s essential to the community. 
The problem is with the idea of *wealth redistribution.* 
Wealth redistribution seeks to use taxes not to build infrastructure and better the community but to ensure that nobody has more than anybody else. That’s the problem.
And here’s the catch, in a democracy, the public are always incentivized to take from the wealthy to give to themselves.

Yes. Bitcoin is not debt. That’s obvious. What I meant was that there is systemic risk to the network - investors buy bitcoin on margin and the miners are funded by debt and dependent on Bitcoin price to stay profitable.  So if Bitcoin continues to drop, the investors go bust, pushing prices so low that the miners would go bankrupt, dropping the hash rate lower and lower until it becomes cheap to mount a 51% attack. That’s the “Bitcoin death spiral”.
Now, it’s never happened before and Bitcoin has dropped a lot in price but it is technically possible
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:52:32


Yes. This is the important part and it’s what I mean by “black Bitcoin”. Any private keys you control, are outside regulatory authority. Sadly, millions of people don’t own their keys and millions of Bitcoin are held on exchanges that can be regulated. This is “white bitcoin” where quasi-banks like Coinbase hold your private keys.
Once a user cedes control of their private keys, they are subject to the whims of regulators. 
It becomes possible to create a whitelisted wallet network that’s prevents black Bitcoin from being sent.  This system would be unlike the wallets we use today. “Dusting” would not be a serious vector of attack since it’s possible to isolate each Bitcoin sent (most people don’t do this because it’s a hassle to check where each bitcoin comes from, but Coinbase could easily automate it on the wallets they manage). Coinbase would simply redirect any unauthorized bitcoin into an Uncle Sam wallet.

The recent bull run is clearly driven by institutional adoption, not retail investor hype. This is the beginning of an epic rally, not the end.
The bull run started in March, within a week of Fidelity’s tweet that they had begun and offering their Bitcoin custody service to select clients. This is not random chance, Fidelity clearly lined up clients who they knew would be major buyers - the clients probably even needed to ante up some big cash to get in on Fidelity’s program.  Fidelity wanted their foray into crypto to start with a bang so they made it happen.  
Welcome to institutional finance.

Adoption is all around you. 
One week after Fidelity rolled out Bitcoin custody to select clients in March, this bull rally started.
Square’s Cash App just last week rolled out a Bitcoin wallet feature to their 15 million users allowing them to buy, send and receive Bitcoin.
Gemini launched their Spedn app that allows Bitcoin payments at millions of retail outlets.
The New York Times published a multi-page article on Bitcoin usage in Venezuela.
Multiple politicians have publicly announced support for bitcoin, including a Democratic Party presidential candidate and an SEC commissioner.
Lightning network has scaled almost 5K nodes and 50K channels.
Facebook announced a stablecoin and wallet, beginning a big tech crypto arms race.
All that adoption and more *plus* the price is approaching an all time high. 
Time to enjoy the ride.

“Default risk” might be higher than you think. Many people use debt to invest in bitcoin. Because bitcoin is highly volatile, the risk that investors default is high, leading to potentially greater volatility caused by margin calling over leveraged investors.
It’s not quite the same as a nation defaulting on its bonds since Bitcoin is not a debt correlated security like fiat is.  Bitcoin is rather a commodity like gold driven by supply and demand.

Pretty much, I’d say. Central banks don’t really buy up gold like they used to when it was the standard to settle international debt. And central banks can’t easily sell off gold without tanking prices, either. So what else can they do but keep it stashed away? 
Fort Knox could be totally emptied by alien invaders tomorrow and it wouldn’t make a difference to anyone.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:13:41
This really should be a chart rather than 4 comparison columns. 
In a chart, you would see that **gold looks extremely volatile.** You would see a massive spike in the value of gold around the late 70s to early 80s, just as the world transitioned off gold standard. And then 20 years of ups, downs and general declining gold prices until another bull run in the 2000s.
So whenever someone says a store of value must be stable, tell them to look at gold. Unstable economic environments make it impossible for any store of value to remain stable - by nature, its price fluctuates relative to other volatile assets.  All a matter of perspective.

Sure, Sherlock. If Bitcoin only goes straight up, it’s better to buy it all now. But that logic got a bunch of fools burned when it crashed 80% in 2017 and they had nothing left to invest. Hell, that logic got a lot of fools burned at $13.5K last month.

I think the stability of stockpiles is much less important than Bitcoin’s adoption and usage. Ripple for example has a fixed 100B supply and zero flow. Great stock to flow ratio but without any significant usage and adoption, it’ll soon be worthless.
Metrics like stock to flow exist in a bubble and distract attention from what matters: ensuring that Bitcoin is widely accepted, traded, and used in the real world.

There’s s great clip floating around where Andreas Antonopoulos explains to Joe Rogan that we are at a cross roads - cryptocurrency will exist but it will either be decentralized and free or it will be centralized and controlled.
It follows that the most significant risks to Bitcoin are centralized stablecoins like Libra.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:55:34


Actually, no. The opposite is true. The bias is towards inflation, cheap money, and currency devaluation. The rich benefit from this because they don’t hold currency, they hold scarce assets. Only the plebeians suffer from currency devaluations, since their wages are denominated in currency that perpetually loses value to the assets sold to them by the wealthy.
Scarcity is a feature of decentralized currencies - first gold, now Bitcoin.

That’s not how custody futures work. When a futures contract settles, Bitcoin will be exchanged (or not exchanged if the contract expires null). Bakkt is the middle man and they will hold bitcoin for the parties on either end of the trade. But Bakkt wouldn’t need to own any bitcoin itself.
It’s similar to how Coinbase doesn’t own bitcoin that it sells to clients, it rather matches buyers and sellers.

Yes. Many people today are using banks, exchanges and traditional finance to manage their Bitcoin investments. In this scenario, Bitcoin is used as the value storage layer but the banks and exchanges remain the value transfer layer. 
This must change, but it’s also not ready to change yet. We need better layer two solutions. Decentralize payment channels like Lightning need to scale. We can all support them by using them more.

Actually, a very good/difficult question. *The Internet of Money* is an easy to read collection of Antonopoulos’ talks.
Personally, I learned a lot from browsing some influential writings from Nobel prize winners.
Robert Mundell - *Monetary Theory* and *The New International Monetary System* are both definitive texts, written just after the US eliminated the gold standard and new ideas about money took shape.
Knapp and Lerner helped develop Modern Monetary Theory - I haven’t read their books but the concept is important to central bank policy (and why the US government is happy to go further and further into debt)
Harry Markowitz - his selected works on Modern Portfolio Theory will help clarify what diversification means, why it’s important and the mathematical model that will soon force all responsible asset managers to invest in Bitcoin.
You can get an overview of their theories on Wikipedia or another synopsis site and buy their books if you want to dive deeper.
I’m currently reading *The Undoing Project*, about Tversky and Kahneman who founded the field of behavioral economics (very interesting, if less directly related to wealth management)
Someday, I expect Satoshi Nakamoto will be awarded a (likely posthumous) Nobel for his/her/their Bitcoin whitepaper.

That’s true. It doesn’t take much volume to push alts to the stratosphere since most altcoins are incredibly illiquid. A few fools buying Ripple at $4.00 in 2017 gave it a $200B market cap.

I’m looking at two fronts, technicals and sentiment.
Resistance at around $10,800. And more broadly, we’re in a cooling phase after a wild parabolic rise. No clear direction or momentum to start the next parabolic rise. There will be plenty of time to pick up around these levels so no rush.
The congressional sessions leaned bullish but left things ambiguous. Mnuchin and Trump were decisively bearish and stated regulation was on its way. This scares institutional investors and the conservative ones will be taking a wait-and-see approach. FUD could push this much lower before we see a big spike.

The daily transaction volume is better for calculating “real loss” not just the illusory paper losses that market cap indicates.  Market cap is a deceptive metric in currencies because they derive their value from liquidity (i.e. transaction volume) not from any total value production. 
By contrast, if someone were to buy an entire company (a pretty common occurance), the value of the company remains the same because the value is pegged to the revenue and profitability of the company.

Losses are not counted unless they are realized. So if you sell, you count it, otherwise you don't.  
To illustrate why market cap is an illusion, consider De Beers diamonds in the 1980s. They controlled 90% of the global supply (over 100 million carats) and the price per carat was about $10,000. So they owned about $1T in value, right? This makes them easily the most valuable company in the world in the 1980s, right?
No. They were sold for less that $20Billion in 2001. This is because they could only liquidate a few $Billion each year without over saturating the market and tanking the price per carat. Nobody gives a damn about the imaginary trillion dollar market cap of De Beer’s diamond collection. They care how much profit De Beers makes in a  year. Time is money after all and De Beers can’t sell diamonds at $10,000/carat very fast.
The same applies to Bitcoin, ETH, and the Almighty Dollar.  The market cap doesn’t matter if you can’t liquidate very fast. Just ask Ripple Labs.

“Association with known entities”
This is not an uncommon tactic. The exact method is unspecified, though. In these types of analysis, there are three, related techniques: 
First, they identify non-illicit transactions. They select wallets that only transact between known, legitimate entities. This is easier, as non-illicit transactions tend to be more transparent. This is the legitimate 21% the  original article mentions.
Second, they look at the narrowed set of questionable transactions. Those that are associated with known illicit entities can be easily be classified as illicit. For example, the addresses of known scams like blackmailers or hackers are easy to trace. Bitcoin tumblers might also be classified as known illicit entities since the act of tumbling Bitcoin is considered illicit, even if the motivation is not necessarily nefarious. This is the 2% mentioned in the article. 
The third technique is the margin of error - and the researchers classified 77% as “unknown”, so it’s a huge margin. This is where ML can assist -  the behaviors of known legitimate and known illicit transactions provides a data set for a ML algorithm to infer the legitimacy of transactions between unknown parties.

If you’re investing in Bitcoin and supporting the growth of the bitcoin ecosystem simply because of the devaluation of USD, then you are proving that inflation motivates investments just as Keynes anticipated.

The people who bought shitcoins in 2017 are gone. The new money coming into Bitcoin is smarter and institutional. Many institutions don’t even have the ability, let alone the interest, to buy alt coins that aren’t offered by respected brokers like Fidelity. 
While some trickle down from BTC to alts is inevitable, it will be concentrated on premium altcoins like Ethereum, which more risk-tolerant institutions will see as a bet on Web 3.0.

Closing remarks here, but wake up and do your research. Take a self-critical view of your assumptions.  I’m not here to be a doomsayer, but I’d prefer the community was aware of the real existential threats to freedom of money.
“The government” refers to the current multi-national government organizations - UN, IMF, WTO, Interpol, etc. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 100 years, you should have figured out that banking and finance are regulated at that international level. 
Aggressive, international KYC laws are a prime example of this. Go ask a Swiss bank if they’ll take your deposit without reporting you and the transaction to your local tax authority.
And a 51% attack is trivial when all the mining corporations have been shut down.  Hell, the government could force a fork and mandate any incorporated mining operation to run their preferred Bitcoin.gov version.
And yes, many government *are* elected by the people. So, as people, we should know exactly what the wrong government officials might do.

Yes. Satoshi’s distinct tone and sentiment are why I don’t think he was Hal Finney. Satoshi was self-important, Hal was humble. Satoshi was impatient, Hal was calm.  Satoshi was an adamant revolutionary, Hal once stated that he believed the future of Bitcoin was to be assimilated into central banking as a global reserve currency. Satoshi distrusted banks, Hal stored his private keys in a safety deposit box inside a bank.
I think that last one says it all. Hal storing private keys in a bank vault tells us more than his words ever could. Even if Satoshi masqueraded in public as a nonchalant family-man like Hal, he would never have stored his keys in a bank - that would be antithetical to his life’s work.
That said, Hal must have known about his neighbor named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, suggesting he at least collaborated with the pseudonymous Satoshi before the white paper was published. I find it most plausible that Satoshi contacted Hal prior to publishing and before he had even chosen his pseudonym, knowing Hal to be an esteemed cryptographer. Together, they refined the Bitcoin white-paper, Satoshi as author, Hal as editor. As they readied to publish the paper, Hal suggested the pseudonym of his neighbor, Satoshi Nakamoto. When it initially met with skepticism from the community, Hal leveraged his clout to give Bitcoin the nudge it needed to gain momentum.

Cash app is incredibly intuitive. But I’m bothered by the hidden fees in every transaction. They add an cumbersome 1.5% markup baked into every transaction. That’s in addition to the fees they charge merchants

@_date: 2019-08-12 16:06:29
Watch out for their hidden fees. They markup the price of BTC when you buy and mark it down before you sell. In the end, you lose about 1.5% on every transaction.

Well, this is what’s called an edge case in software and the key to good software design is to not let edge cases define the core decisions. Edge cases require edge solutions. 
One such edge solution is a local network 2nd layer. Each offline wallet records its own record of the value its holding and can send that value to another wallet without validation. When those wallets go back online, the network checks the validity of each wallets record, aggregating transactions. It’s not especially secure, but neither is a lemonade stand.

You should read more about it. The idea behind PoS is that PoW miners don’t *actually* need to burn electricity to secure the network. When they burn electricity, they are essentially saying, “I believe in the current state of the blockchain ledger and you all can be believe me because if I’m lying I would lose the money I invested in electricity costs”. Why not abstract that process? Skip the wasteful burning of electricity and get straight to the point: the value that’s at stake if anyone is dishonest.

That comes out to about a $5trillion market cap (less if we account for lost coins). Gold is about $8trillion.
How do we get there for Bitcoin? Nationalist competition is how. Countries like China, Russia and Venezuela have already begun to see Bitcoin as way to diminish the power of the USD. If this trend continues, the inability of nations to form a consensus around USD (or any other single national currency) as the global standard will force them find consensus in the decentralization of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will then become an internationally accepted reserve currency and could achieve a $5-20 trillion market cap (in today’s dollars)

@_date: 2019-08-14 07:15:24
Yes, in the near future, it seems likely that a black market for truly anonymous bitcoin will exist if it doesn’t already in China. Here’s why:
Imagine a totalitarian government regulates every bitcoin on-ramp and off-ramp. This totalitarian government forces exchanges to only transact between known entities - either companies or individuals who have self-identified. Further, these exchange only allow users to send bitcoin to addresses managed by wallet services that abide by the same strict KYC laws. Users can’t send Bitcoin to any wallet that is not whitelisted - they are blocked by their wallet app from sending to any unknown entity.  Once Bitcoin goes through a surveilled exchange, it can never leave the watchful eye of the government.
The only way to own Bitcoin outside of this surveillance system would be to buy it directly from the source - miners. This would be consider Black Bitcoin, it could only be transacted amongst unregulated wallets and if it was ever sent to a regulated exchange, the government would confiscate it or else, require the sender to submit their identity, an admission of guilt for owning Black Bitcoin. 
Now, when you hear Mnuchin say he will aggressively regulate on-ramps and off-ramps, this is exactly what he means. China, of course, is probably further along than the US.
This would be similar to what happened to gold in the US with Order 6102 but today, governments have a host of digital surveillance tools to enforce regulation.

Correct. But there’s problems with that model. Probability is a curve.
It might be a 0.25-1% chance that Bitcoin replaces all of money in 40 years 
But the probability of a more modest outcome, say it’s 30% odds that Bitcoin becomes a major store of value alongside gold with an $8T marketcap within 20 years.
Or even more modestly, say that Bitcoin merely reaches the mcap of a single big bank, like JPM. That’s perhaps an 95% chance that Bitcoin doubles in value from here in at least 10 years (halvening’s alone could drive cost of production up 4x).
So here, there’s a high chance it hits 2x, a moderate chance it hits 20x and a total lottery that it hits 200x. 
Most investors pay far more for worse odds in stocks.  Bitcoin could conservatively be worth $60-80K today if it were valued like most other assets.

• LN doesn’t remove mining incentive. LN transactions are just batched before settling to the main chain.

LN just makes latte purchases economical - which ultimately will drive more traffic to the main chain.
• It scales just fine with second layer solutions like LN.
• Halvenings and difficulty adjustments have worked in harmony for the past decade to make mining profitable - evidenced by the all time high hash rate we just recently saw.

Well, yes, obviously, Hal claimed to not have known Satoshi at all. That doesn’t prove much. Hal’s motive to claim ignorance is self-evident from his life’s work on digital anonymity (PGP, Bitcoin) and the cryptography mailing list where the Bitcoin White-Paper was published.
It sounds like a cover up to me. Why would Hal have actually thought that Nakamoto was Japanese? Nakamoto speaks in *perfect* American English. Hal knew that cypherpunks culture is Japanophilic and also knew that ‘Satoshi’ was a pseudonym.  To put it in perspective, I don’t suspect your u/Yorn2 username means you are from Cambodia, where that name is common. Since you speak articulately in English with precise words like “fruition”, I would guess you are from a place where English is the native language.
It’s extremely unlikely to be coincidence that Hal lived in a town of just 35K people within 2-3 blocks of a man with the *exact* same name the pseudonymous inventor of the Bitcoin project, which Hal was the very first known person in the world to note as significant, contribute to and use to transact.  Not to mention, Satoshi disappeared roughly the same time frame as Hal became disabled.  That is enough evidence to conclude, with above 99% probability, that Hal Finney and Satoshi Nakamoto were connected before and beyond their first known correspondence. At the least, they knew each other prior to coining the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”, at the most, Hal Finney and Satoshi Nakamoto are the same person.

Economists separate the forms of money into categories - M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 that represent increasing broad definitions of money. M0 is limited to cold hard cash. M4 includes things like bank accounts and money derivatives.
Broader types of money (M3 and M4) are difficult to measure due to fractional reserve banking, debt and derivatives. So the estimates vary widely but generally range from $100 trillion to $200 trillion.
Crypto-enthusiasts often make the error of assuming this can be used to benchmark the potential marketcap for Bitcoin (that’s why some believe Bitcoin is going to $10 million/BTC).
This is erroneous. The reason can be simply understood when you think of a trader who buys a Bitcoin futures contract that’s tied to the value of 1 Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up, this trader makes profit, but he does not actually own the Bitcoin. Neither the traded nor the broker has bought the underlying Bitcoin and may never intend to. So the value of the contract does not contribute to Bitcoin market cap. It exists in addition to the value of the Bitcoin it is tied to.
Under the M4, this future contract is considered money. As you can imagine, for each 1 Bitcoin there can be a hundreds of future contracts. In the modern economy, M4 is worth tens or hundreds of times the value of M0, M1 or M2.

I hope that’s /s cause that’s all really bad financial advice. 
A mortgage or a low rate auto loan should be paid back slower than all your other debt. And on average, putting a dollar in the stock market is better than paying down your home.
That’s all very different from buying a vacation or a new kitchen on loan when you have crypto sitting around.

Quite simple how that would work. 
Governments have already made it very difficult to buy Bitcoin without personal identification (KYC). Next step is to require all wallet providers to register users. They can then mandate that merchants refuse to accept any Bitcoin payment unless it’s coming from a registered wallet from a known identity. And they might even prevent wallet owners from sending to unregistered wallets (BitPay has already been accused for rejecting transactions).
None of that would change the Bitcoin Core codebase. It’s be a second layer. And users determined to subvert government authority would find a way around. But governments can make it difficult, impractical, and legally risky to interact with unregistered wallets.

Coinbase is fine - it’s the same 1.5% that you get charged by Square’s Cash App or Gemini. But some noobs don’t realize Cash App and others are charging hidden fees. Coinbase is not great but there are a lot worse options.

Yes. S/F is pseudoscience.
Stock-to-flow is based on cherrypicked data and has been shown to have nearly *zero ability* to predict crypto prices. BCH for example has the exact same S/F as BTC and yet 1/40th the price. We can observe the same failure of this metric in ETH, XRP, LTC, etc.
Others may argue that S/F *just doesn’t work* for those cryptos but *it just does* for Bitcoin. No evidence. No explanation. *It just does or doesn’t* and nobody knows why or when. 
And yet, as you point out, we know that $13 million price per BTC that S/F is functionally impossible unless the entire global economy implodes. So the one thing we know for certain, is that S/F will fail in the future. The only question is “when?”

Bitcoin is a good investment for now but ultimately it should be spent so that the newly wealthy can buy homes, invest in assets or start new businesses.
In a functional economy, people who “save” money lose to people who invest money.

That’s the whole point of a company - isolate risk. Put debt risk on companies to grow and then distribute profits to private shareholders.  People hold cash, companies hold debt.
In most cases, having a large cash holding on the books is seen by investors as a bad thing - after all, if the business were effective, they could surely find better ways to invest it than cash. And if they can’t find better ways to invest than cash, perhaps investors shouldn’t be giving them *more* money to invest.
CCN folded not because it couldn’t pay debts (it could have raised money) but because there was no point to paying its debts.

If you were watching closely, the beginning of this run began almost precisely when Fidelity announced they would be rolling out Bitcoin custody for select clients in mid-March. 
This is not a herd driven pump, it is purely institutional... and even then it is a small minority of institutions - Fidelity rolled out Bitcoin to just 5 clients to start and they are still in a trial period. Just wait until late summer when both Fidelity goes live for most clients and Bakkt goes live in beta.

It’s virtually impossible that Paul “Solotshi” Calder Le Roux invented, developed and grew Bitcoin in 2008-2010 while simultaneously expanding his cartel business across multiple continents and multiple illicit industries from arms dealing to drug trafficking.
The circumstantial evidence tying Le Roux to the invention of Bitcoin is weaker than the evidence for either David Kleiman or even Craig Wright.
Here’s a point-by-point debunking:
- “Solotshi” seems similar to “Satoshi” only to Westerners without a knowledge of Japanese. Satoshi is a common name in Japan meaning wise or intelligent.  “Solotshi” means nothing in Japanese.
- Le Roux began illegal ventures in 2007 and expanded them over the following 5 years until his arrest in 2012, meaning he was preoccupied with managing his cartel business precisely when the real Nakamoto would have been working tirelessly to invent, develop and scale Bitcoin.
- Le Roux was apprehended in 2012 but Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared in 2010 - close but not close enough. If Le Roux really developed Bitcoin, he likely would have immediately integrated it into his own businesses and begun moving his holdings to privately transact.
- Le Roux’s experience in encryption is not unique. He was one of thousands of developers that built hundreds of encryption programs in the decades before the Bitcoin whitepaper. 
- His writing and syntax is not unique - He and Nakamoto both use British English variations like colour and analyse, as do hundreds of millions of other English speakers.
- Given the obvious overlap between virtual currencies and online poker chips, Nakamoto’s use of a poker client to demonstrate a Bitcoin use case shouldn’t be surprising. This doesn’t suggest Nakamoto had any particular affinity for online gambling. Similarly, Le Roux’s involvement in online gambling isn’t a unique attribute.

That’s mostly hype but the nugget of truth is that most people living through the 90s didn’t realize how much the internet was about to change ordinary life.
A more apt analogy is that Bitcoin/blockchain is a layer on top of the internet, like cloud streaming/rendering/computing.  The first application of cloud computing was cloud storage - like Dropbox. But then we developed the ability to stream applications over the cloud, like Google Docs or Netflix. Once we had that ability, we started doing more intensive computations in the cloud - we are just beginning to see these technologies hit the mainstream like cloud gaming and cloud AIs that power self-driving cars. In 5 years, you might use a $50 cloud based smartphone that can stream 1000x more power than a MacBook Pro.
Sounds exciting but there’s one catch - big companies control this cloud.
Blockchain will be a valuable component to decentralize this new cloud era. Like Dropbox, Bitcoin is about storing information. Dropbox stored files centrally, Bitcoin stores value decentrally. The important distinction is that decentralized storage means you actually own what is stored - you don’t entrust it to Dropbox to store for you. 
The next phase of the decentralized cloud will see Dapps transferring information and value continuously. Identity is a good use case. Your identity may be stored in a decentralized cloud rather than a Facebook cloud. Your virtual passport will be stored in this decentralized cloud and you can use it to sign in to any website or even get on an airplane
Eventually, we might run very computationally intensive apps in the cloud. You might have a self-driving car powered by the decentralized cloud that can’t be controlled by an AI company like Waymo that might try to charge you to self-drive your car.

To be fair, the broker is using familiar industry parlance.  The article is misinterpreting it. “Available supply” is a common concept in finance that can mean one of two things. Either it means the supply that is available to be sold at a certain price, or the supply that is available to be sold at a given time.
“Currently available” then would be the supply that’s available to be sold in a time frame or at a price that’s considered “current” - probably a day to a week.

S/F is a metric from precious metals and awhile back an analyst saw that gold price and S/F had some historical correlation to Bitcoin price and S/F. 
It’s problematic for a few reasons:
- it’s proven that it doesn’t apply broadly to crypto - it fails to correlate to BCH, LTC, ETH, XRP, etc. So it’s unclear if it will continue to correlate to BTC.
- it’s denominated in USD and assumes a steady value of USD.
- it predicts an infinitely high value of Bitcoin as Bitcoin issuance drops to zero. This suggests the metric will degrade with time.
- it ignores the reality that adoption is far more important than made up metrics.

Nope, this doesn’t discourage miners from mining. The miners and investors refuse to sell Bitcoin for less than it costs to mine, so the price typically appreciates until it is profitable again.
This is why you typically see a massive price spike about 1 year before and 1 year after a halvening event. The supply becomes excessively restricted so the price starts going up, then no-coiners get FOMO so they start buying, pumping prices even more. Eventually, the price pump from the FOMO buyers gets to high and they start dumping and the price normalizes around the new low, supported my mining costs

Most replied with the same “Didn’t that day years ago?” But it turned out one friend was sitting on a huge stash since he founded a Bitcoin startup in the early days.  I asked what made Bitcoin special from any other digital coin.  He said it just was - something about decentralized trust, consensus and other ideas I didn’t understand.
I started reading and I was immediately hooked, first on Bitcoin and then Ethereum.  I invested mostly in Ethereum because it seemed more useful and powerful but I picked up a few Bitcoin as well.
Slowly I started to learn what my friend had tried to tell me... Bitcoin had the most awareness, users, trust, longevity and therefor, the most value.  And that was more important than any other technical feature anyone could engineer.  All other cryptocurrencies vie for technical superiority because they can be replaced by better technology.  But Bitcoin’s power resides in the people who trust and believe in it.  It could improve if it ever needed. It might adopt technologies from newer cryptocurrencies. But no other cryptocurrency could replicate its community and history.

Bitcoin is actually a way of making renewable energy production more profitable.
A lot of people don’t realize that clean energy production is *not* the challenge. The real challenge is clean energy *storage and transportation*. Storing clean energy in batteries degrades the batteries and doesn’t last long. So for now, excess clean energy gets produced and can’t easily leave geothermal power plants in Iceland, dams in rural China, or solar farms in Arizona. Bitcoin allows these energy producers to turn a profit today so they can continue to grow their infrastructure to be ready to supply a 100% clean energy future when it comes (probably via hydrogen fuel cells, not toxic Lithium Ion batteries).
So buy up your Bitcoin because they are clean energy bucks.

Hal Finney himself stated he believed Bitcoin could serve as a global reserve currency - not a replacement for fiat.
Fiat is not going away. Governments can still force transactions, wages and taxes within their jurisdictions to be denominated in their national currency.
Zero-inflation money does not change that. But it is an alternative. Just as the US dollar or the Euro are alternatives for Venezuelans or Argentinians. And gold is an alternative for UK and US citizens.
As an alternative to the fiat system, Bitcoin can only be beneficial to the global economy, another option for people to store value protected from inflation.

It’s better to ignore the Bitcoin anarchists. Banks perform a myriad of functions:
There are good ones like home loans, small business loans, car loans, safely storing money, etc. 
And then there are more nefarious ones like fractional reserve savings accounts, credit cards, stock brokering, etc. 
And there are totally evil things like manipulating global markets
Bitcoin replaces a few of those. But some, like loans, are better handled by something like a credit union.

The difficulty adjustment guarantees a fixed rate of new supply issuance. This makes Bitcoin stable.

I’d be so curious to read some serious psychological research on how people fall for dumb scams. 
EDIT: I went and read some research and it seems people who fall for fraud have an imbalance in their perceived risk vs reward (related to dopamine response mechanism). This reminds me of research I read on people who become addicted to gambling at the slot machine.  Their brain does not feel emotions associated with loss as strongly as it feels emotions associated with gain. Therefore, the emotional risk/reward in their mind is different than the mathematical risk reward. The value to their brain of a dollar gained is much much greater than the value of a dollar lost. Some psychoactive medications that influence dopamine can cause this imbalance.

The article quotes David Murray, a misinformed bureaucrat who erroneously believes that the US Government can and should control Bitcoin transactions by regulating miners. Murray seems to be confusing the role of Bitcoin miners as validators to mean they have jurisdiction over which transactions to validate.  This is entirely moronic as anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the Bitcoin network can attest. Yet the MIT Technology Review reports on Murray's idea as if it is credible, barely investigating the counter-arguments that are literally written in the Bitcoin white-paper.
To be clear, Bitcoin miners do not have discretion over the transactions they validate. Any attempt to discriminate between transactions without consensus would be rejected by the network and causing bad acting miners to lose their investment. Only by mounting a 51% could any government attempt to regulate transactions through the mining network. Such a malicious attempt would force a fork and the remaining neutral miners would split away from the government controlled network. Since its inception, Bitcoin was designed to resist just such attack’s as Murray proposes. David Murray's scheme is not very clever and he clearly doesn't understand what he is talking about.

WeWork is an office space lessor that controls more of New York’s square footage than anyone and aims similarly dominate the U.S. leasing industry. 
They were a rapidly growing startup who’s on-paper valuation exploded to almost $50B through a series of funding rounds led almost entirely by SoftBank. For perspective, that put their valuation on par with massive brands like Tesla and Uber, about 50% more valuable than AirBnB and about twice the valuation of Hilton.
But WeWorks valuation looks a lot like a new breed of pump and dump. For example, at the start of this year, SoftBank invest $1 billion in WeWork at a $20B valuation and in the same funding round, they invested another $1B at a $40B+ valuation - effectively doubling the paper value of the first billion.

@_date: 2019-09-07 18:05:52
You’re only partially correct.
1. As long as the public key is truly anonymous, the miners have no way to differentiate between transactors.  But if the public key is linked to a specific identity, then some miners could refuse certain individual customers.
2. However, any miner can validate any transaction and are not prevented from doing so by any other miners. If one miner refuses a transaction, another can pick it up. And as long as just 1 miner picks it up, it will still be validated unless the majority other miners choose to censor it (a 51% attack). Any attempt to “invalidate” a transaction without consensus would be rejected.
3. The authors of this article do not understand what they are talking about. They imply that the US Government could force the network to censor certain addresses and transactions. This could only be done with a 51% attack and that would force a fork away from government controlled miners.

No. Just no. 


The net effect is not zero because, for the duration of the contract, a portion of those Bitcoins are held in escrow, eliminated from the liquid supply. When you have thousands of contracts, trading $billions in BTC, that creates a lot of demand for Bitcoin to be tied up in contracts and perpetually removed from the available supply.

Never read the book, but the reviews, like this, are just scathing.
The whole “hard money” fetishization is one of the weakest arguments for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s disinflationary nature is hardly unique. The real secret sauce of Bitcoin is the difficulty adjustment mechanism and decentralized trust.
I suppose it seems like a decent primer on Bitcoin economics for people who’s only prior knowledge on econ comes from the American public school system.

I found out about Bitcoin when it cracked $300. I was in college with limited knowledge of finance or comp sci. 
I assumed Bitcoin was created and operated by some tech startup and so it seemed destined to fail like eCash and other predecessors.
From the articles I read on news sites, Bitcoin had all the hallmarks of a bubble. No intrinsic value and skyrocketing valuation. Not to mention it was used almost exclusively for buying drugs on Silk Road or gambling. 
I now know that the news sites pumping out FUD articles were nonsense. But many people still can’t see through of all the sensationalism - you’ve got the bears, the bulls, the altcoiners, Roger Verr, r/btc, Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin rap battles, etc. It’s all one huge confusing mess. We need clarity from trusted experts and that will come with institutional adoption like Bakkt and Fidelity.

There is a silver lining. Previously, CME only offered cash settled futures. Bakkt making Bitcoin settled futures will require a certain amount of Bitcoin to be perpetually warehoused - whether locked in escrow or waiting to be traded. This effectively reduces the available supply and boosts price more than CME futures.

I get your sentiment, but realistically, Bakkt shat the bed. ICE *should* have been drumming up clients all summer for a bang up launch day. Their NYSE division certainly knows how to coordinate an IPO.
By comparison, the most recent multi-month bull run began the very same week that Fidelity launched their Bitcoin service to the first five clients.

I think you’re misunderstanding futures. Futures contracts are not typically entirely naked - they require a down payment held in escrow. Of course, this can be leveraged so the buyer doesn’t need to pay the entire value of the contract up front. And since they are an institutional tool, the leverage can be much higher and lower interest.
But, critically, the two parties of a future contract  are *obligated* to complete the transaction at a future date. This is why physical settlement is a critical feature of Bakkt - actual Bitcoin trades hands for dollars when the contract expires.
How this works for miners is they can agree to sell the Bitcoin they will produce in the future at a fixed dollar value based on the current trading price - hedging against the risk of a future collapse in Bitcoin price. This is a bearish trade.
Alternatively, bullish speculators might agree to buy Bitcoin in the future based on the current market price and they would give a down payment today and pay the rest at expiry - either with cash on hand or by immediately selling the Bitcoin they receive (if they are leveraged)
Lastly, futures arbitrage traders will simultaneous buy Bitcoin on the open market and agree to sell that Bitcoin at a higher price in the future - cashing in on the futures premium if the it’s higher than the dollar’s rate of inflation.

The $100K thesis is simply that text-book money management strategy will require institutions to allocate a portion of their capital to Bitcoin as part of a balanced and diversified portfolio.
First, read about Markovitz modern portfolio theory, the Nobel Prize winning idea that investors should diversify proportionally into every asset class. This theory is at the core of institutional investment strategy.
Then realize that Bitcoin represents a new, uncorrelated asset class that institutions following a broad diversification strategy are obligated to invest in once it reaches sufficient size. 
Right now, Bitcoin is right at the cusp of “sufficient size”, and so more and more institutions are diversifying into it. For example, most of the ivy league endowment funds already hold positions in Bitcoin. As Bitcoin grows, it becomes more difficult for money managers to ignore - regardless of whether they “believe” in it or not, modern portfolio theory states they should invest.
So, a responsible money manager who’s goal is to preserve his clients’ wealth would have to see the astronomic rise of Bitcoin as a risk to their perfectly balanced portfolio. And to hedge that risk, they would be wise to own Bitcoin. 
The more money managers that invest, the more pressure for other money managers to follow. Eventually, it seems possible that 1% of global investments could be allocated to Bitcoin, ascribing a $2-5 trillion market cap and a $100-300K btc price (depending on how much has been lost)
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:57:58

Exactly this. Anyone saying ‘the 21 million supply cap means not even 0.1 BTC for every American’ needs to look at the stats on wealth distribution: 
Of the ~330 million people in the U.S., fewer than 200 million are adults spread across ~130 million households.
A full 14% of all households have *negative* net worth. 
69% of U.S. adults have less than $1000 in savings while about half of that group actually have no savings at all.
So, it’s safe to guess that less than 60 million U.S. citizens even have enough spare cash to consider investing in any crypto. I’d guess 15 million people in the U.S. hold any Bitcoin. Coinbase alone already has 30 million customers (but not all are in the U.S.) Gemini doesn’t disclose user growth but it’s at least another few million unique users. And probably a few million more are spread between the other exchanges. Lastly a small portion hold their own private keys on a hardware wallet. 
So of the 60 million addressable market, perhaps 25% is already tapped. 
I’d imagine European and major Asian market adoption is similar.

Actually, the nations of the world had already decided that gold was the international reserve currency. We all know that at this time the USD was backed by gold. So as the US became the worlds largest lender, it also accumulated the world’s largest gold reserves.
Of course, nobody spent actual gold, they spent gold equivalent bank notes and since the USD was backed by the largest gold reserve, it quickly became the most important bank note. 
USD became the worlds reserve currency because international debt was paid in gold and the USD represented the largest gold holdings in the world.  Holding USD was like holding gold that was easy to spend, so most nations did that. When the US went off the gold standard in 1971, nations had large holdings of USD that they didn’t want to be worthless... so they played along with the new fiat standard.

The most secure storage is a combination of [steganography]( hardware wallet seed phrases, and trusted relationships.
Use a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor to generate a seed phrase for a multi-sig wallet. Write the seed phrase on a piece of paper using your own handwritten encryption (like the stuff kids use to pass notes in school) with a separate handwritten key that you can remember. Also, engrave this into a piece of steel. Take a photograph of the piece of paper using a non-WiFi digital camera. Import the photo into a computer thats not connected to the internet. Using Steganographic image encryption software, encrypt your image into another image that seems totally normal - like a family photo. Write down the encryption key and engrave it in a piece of steel - make two copies. Store the encrypted image in a folder with thousands of other photos that seem similar (you can even fake encrypt some of them as decoys) and copy it to 4 usb drives. Print 1 copy (use an old school copier not connected to WiFi) of the encrypted photo.
Wipe the original hardware wallet. Burn the pieces of paper. Wipe the camera. Wipe your laptop.
You now have 4 usb drives with the encrypted image on them, 1 physical copies of the image, 2 steel objects with the image encryption keys and 1 steel objects with your handwritten encryption key. 
Store one usb drive in your personal safe. Store one of the steel image encryption keys in a safety deposit box. Give one usb drive + the copy of the encrypted photo to a trusted family/friend (this is the only other person besides you who will know what the right image on the usb is but they have no keys). Give one usb drive + the steel copy of the image encryption key to another trusted family/friend (this person has one of two keys but doesn’t know what image to decrypt). Give one usb + the steel copy of your handwritten encryption key to another family/friend.
The puzzle has 4 pieces. The folder of images, the knowledge of the correct encrypted image, the encrypted image key, and the handwritten encryption key. Each of the 3 trusted friends/family has 2 pieces of the puzzle. They need 2 more to unlock it. You however, have all 4 pieces of the puzzle and all are backed by a family/friend. 2 of your pieces are stored in your memory (the handwritten key and the knowledge of the image). One of your pieces, the usb with the images, is stored in your personal safe and backed up 3 times by your family/friends. Your last piece is stored in a safety deposit box that, even if confiscated, cannot be used alone to crack your encryption.

Okay, everyone seems to be misunderstanding what this dealer said so I’ll explain - the client wanted to buy about 25% of all *currently available* bitcoin - which basically means the currently traded volume (about $500mil/day according to the Bitwise report). This *does not mean* the client wanted to buy 25% of the entire supply of Bitcoin worth around $150billion. That would be impossible. 
In other words, the client was looking to buy a few hundred million dollars worth of BTC - which is a perfectly reasonable amount for a large institutional client to buy and a exactly the type of transaction a private broker would help coordinate.

But we are good at remembering images.  Hackers are good at searching through text to find signs of encryption, but bad at searching images for encryption.

The article is misleading. The dealer stated the client want 25% of all “currently available” bitcoin.
That typically means 25% of daily volume... it doesn’t mean 25% of all bitcoins in existence.
The client wanted to drop a few hundred mil USD into Bitcoin - a perfectly reasonable transaction to request a broker’s assistance.

The only asset Bitcoin is correlated to is itself. 
Bitcoin price repeats because the only piece of information that analysts can use to project its future growth is its historical growth.  Price growth is all we have in the absence of other common valuation metrics like profits, revenue, debt, etc. used to predict most investments.
In other words, bitcoin price history repeats because we all believe it will repeat.

Pomp would be solid. He’s the type of entrepreneurial bro that appeals to Rogan’s fan base. Pomp also seems to have interests outside of Bitcoin to talk about.

Live with 5 institutional clients as of the start of this month. Keep in mind, to be on this select list, these clients would have already agreed to (or expressed interest in) a high minimum investment. Fidelity wants their crypto service to start with a bang (and what curious luck ;) they’ve had in their opening month). A tweet around mid-month suggested they’d begun scaling to more clients.

The log chart curve shows peak-to-peak flattening out - meaning troughs will eventually dip below the preceding peak, whether it happens on this cycle or the next.
Personally, I see Bitcoin hitting $80K and pulling back to perhaps the mid-teens, keep it consistent with it’s usual 80% or so decline.

Hard to say. Mining difficulty sky rocketed 3 months after he bought that pizza. By the time there was any market for USD/BTC, most of those early miners were selling everything they could all the way up. It didn’t make sense to hold when you could reinvest in mining hardware that would make your money back in a month.

If you want top security, you can encrypt a private key into any image. There are a number of ways to do this - some work better for printouts than others. You could frame the image and give it to them as a gift.

Wealth is redistributed the way it always is - ambitious young investors make bad decisions and lose their family fortunes.  Trust fund babies spend all their inheritance looking for the meaning of life.  And unfulfilled heirs split their wealth in multiple divorces.

I’m all for the USD being used in the US. I don’t expect it to continue as the international standard.
The USD doesn’t just get its value from US taxes. It’s also the global reserve currency as a result of the US’s position as the largest lender in the world after WWII. This legacy is fading as the US shifts to becoming one of largest borrowers and pays its debts by printing more dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:23:45
What’s the historical context? Where and why was this originally published. The US didn’t abandon the gold standard until 1971.

Less baggage. More optimism. For startups, it’s often better to start fresh. Engineers building new things in 2017 aren’t as knowledgeable as the same engineers building new things today.

Even if a token provides utility, it might not have much value.  It all depends on where value is stored and value tends to be store in the network that most people trust. That’s the killer use case of bitcoin. Most people who send money over Monero, don’t keep their money in Monero for very long.

You sure you don’t want to wait until $40K? Ya know. Just to be sure that the crypto winter is over. Can never be to safe. Might want to wait for $100K.

Yea. About 2 BTC and you can reasonably hope to make a cool million.

I was dollar cost averaging at those levels. I’d been able to load up around $2K in spring 2017 so anything more than that still seems pricey

Yes. Humans have a habit of trying to exert their will on others. Bitcoin doesn’t promise equality. But it bring us closer to equal opportunity

Yes. US debt is a part of the world that will continue as long as the US is around - but this debt will no longer be a global standard for transacting and storing value.
Will Bitcoin become the global reserve currency? I believe it has the best chance of any available option. The more people who have faith in it the more likely it becomes that everyone will eventually use it.

Great comment.  Steganography should be used more often.
Personally, I’ve been working on a method allow to people to write their seed phrase on a piece of paper, take a photo of that paper, encrypt the image (not the text strings) into another image.

The magic phrase is *risk adjust rate of return*. i.e. the amount and likelihood Bitcoin can grow vs the amount and likelihood it can decline. 
The middle of the range of bullish estimates for the next peak are around $80K. A clean 10x or so from recent price. The downside risk is, of course, total collapse to zero. More likely, the recent low of $3-4K seems like a strong support - a 50% drop or so. Assuming (for the purpose of simplicity) 50/50 odds of either the bull or bear case. The risk adjusted rate of return on bitcoin under this (super rudimentary and unrealistic) formula is 500% with the next 1-2 years. 
The risk adjusted rate of return on each dollar you invest to pay down your mortgage is equivalent to the 4% or so interest fees you save yourself each year. Not much risk there - (maybe .01% that you foreclose at a loss).
Bitcoin is certainly a gamble. You might lose big and many people have. But the pay off for that risk is huge.

If stocks, bonds and real estate really tank, eventually the returns on a recovery will outweighs the returns on Bitcoin. People will then sell Bitcoin to buy something else.
Personally, if Bitcoin is ever at $40K when stocks are down over 60%, I’d selling my Bitcoin to buy stocks or get a house on the cheap.

Depends on the type of usage. It’s market cap is a pretty solid indicator of its use as a store of value. But it’s not a great tell for the real transactions.

Wrong. The halvening is exactly proof that Bitcoin is correlated to itself.
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:03:52
The client wanted to buy 25% of “currently available” bitcoins. *currently available*... that means 25% of *daily supply* not total supply.
The article is deeply misleading. This is how insane rumors get started.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:01:53
Many people hold about 1% in gold. So maybe someone with assets of $20 million will have $200K.

If exchanges want to be taken seriously by the finance industry, they need to be more judicious about the coins they list.  Delisting BSV was a start. But what about Bitcoin Gold, Diamond, Platinum, etc?
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:33:54
You could almost buy back in on GDAX and have yourself a net of like 1.01 BTC - which is approximately equivalent to $404,000 in the year 2030.
