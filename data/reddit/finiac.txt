The futures market has nothing do to with buying or selling an actual bitcoin. It’s literally a side bet between two random people, connected through a brokerage firm. It’s basically one person betting the other that the price will go up or down and then at a certain date in the future the price is settled based on the BTR price which is the average of several exchange prices such as GDAX.
The advantage of betting in the futures market is that the price will go up and down similar to bitcoin and I don’t have to fuck around with actually buying a coin, which is sketchy these days it seems, it’s all settled in cash outside of bitcoin.
The impact to bitcoin will likely be that people who would have normally bought a bitcoin the traditional way, may now make a bet in the futures market instead which avoids the hassle of engaging in the actual process of buying a coin. In theory this should stabilize the price and in this case decrease it since new money that may have gone to buying a coin is now spent in the futures market.

It’s pretty crazy right? It’s literally legal gambling, but this is very common in business especially ones that are cash settled only. In my opinion it’s the near exact same thing as buying a coin and less risky. Think about it, you don’t have to hold a wallet or worry about your coins being stolen or dealing with these exchanges.

I also want to add that it should add some transparency to the price as well. Now that you can trade on a regulated exchange, my guess is companies such as tether may require an actual audit some day, in my opinion, maybe...
