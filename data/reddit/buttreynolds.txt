Good shill. Ignoring shilling BTW.

Please change your misleading username. Also, stop replying to shitposts. It will always make you look dumb.

and what about all other forms of insider trading? what if I know something like core announcing a change in their roadmap?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:39
right from the wikipedia's mouth


the vast majority of it has no predictive power (and almost certainly all of it that you can eyeball without 50 years of data learned into neural networks) which is why no institutional investors use it
however, you can find a lot of people willing to teach you their secrets for $9.99
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:23
yes, every time until the one time it doesn't
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:53
you shouldn't do TA anywhere because the majority of it is unfounded and the most value you can get out of it is selling website advertisements and books to chumps

How do you code in a way to regulate insider trading?

Bitcoin is not about avoiding taxes or bringing down "the man". You have applied your own political views and aspirations to it. Keep the anarchist/extreme libertarian baggage hidden, thanks.

BCH transaction volume is as large or larger than BTC.

The cloud mining site is a scam. Stop paying.

well if mcafee predicted it
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:07:30
this is good for bitcoin

unregulated markets like gdax make it so you basically cant get reliable info from buy/sell orders
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:57:06
TA has little to no predictive power. You should try a magic 8 ball for the same results with less wasted effort. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:14
the market is unregulated, the buy orders are faking support and don't actually fill

The liquidity/trade volume of gold is one of the largest in the world, even ignoring OTC trades. Selling and buying gold coins is largely based on the material value.

should be a good 3 month business
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:03:52
you really think that?
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:05:01
They mostly don't. TA is not well respected by the professional community. It doesn't have good research showing predictive powers. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:36:55
You're absolutely right that one of the main obstacles to testing TA is that its entirely subjective which shapes appear in your bar chart tea leaves. There has been research into trying to convert indicators into more concrete and systematic definitions, and applying them to large amounts of historical data. They even have used neural networks and tried teaching it into learning its best to recognize the patterns, and then had it try to apply it to live data.
I think the main problem people have with TA is that it's just so unscientific. It's like having someone come up to you and tell you about how they've had so much success at blackjack at the casino. You can find hundreds of people who swear by blackjack strategy being profitable long term, when we just know it isn't mathematically, without an outside variable adjusting the odds.
It comes off as a cheap get rich quick scheme peddled by con artists to people who don't want to actually learn to understand investing, but just want an easy trick to get rich. Not unlike the one quick trick dentists don't want you to know to get white teeth from this sweet home remedy. How do you know it doesn't work? Have scientists tried everything possible on their teeth? 
Wikipedia probably has the most nuanced opinion on the matter
