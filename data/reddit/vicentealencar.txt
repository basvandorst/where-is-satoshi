I just said that the industrial value, alone, doest not explain its current price. In other words, if gold was not used as a store of value, its price would be far lower

I am starting to think F.A. Hayek's brain was uploaded to a computer and adopted the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:44:20
Those uses wouldnt generate enough demand to justify its  current price though

You can't beat the crowd if you follow the crowd. If you are to make real money with your investments, you have to be bullish when everybody else is bearish (and vice-versa).

Even though Luke's proposal does make sense, miners would never follow through because this would render their business uselesss. Without miner support, classic will go nowhere.

For the system rules to be rules they have to be adopted. Otherwise, they are just rules in a theoretical system that doesnt exist.

"Limiting the block size to force fees to go up makes no sense economically. Goes against economies of scale. It is just like saying that companies should produce less of a given profitable item in order to sell it at a more expensive price.
miners would end up making a lot more money if they could process gazillions of transactions at low fees, since the cost to add more transactions to a block is marginal to running the node."

In which case the business will try to get more supply channels open in order to expand the access of its customers to its products. Is bitcoin doing that?
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:44:43
And why is bitcoin not a highly competitive market? Anyone can buy an asic and be a miner. On top of that, anyone can create a competing crypto.
I dont see any resemblance between bitcoin mining and diamond mining. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:43:44
Miners just wouldnt adopt that change and it would just help BU to become the dominant chain

That's impossible. Humans are political by nature, that's how we evolved and, btw, it's what made us develop our intelligence.

I thought bitcoin unlimited posts were off limit
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:45:01
It actually depends on price elasticity. Limitting supply usually means you will sell less, which means profits could go down.
Generally, when margins are high, it is more profitable to produce more. There people out there that are willing to pay $300 on a bottle of coke. However, Coca Cola makes more money by selling them at $1

Thats the way it is with software. For every chunk of product code, much more test code is needed in order to give it proper coverage.

The bailout money comes from inflation. In a bitcoin-powered society, governments can't steal from you by inflating the currency because they have no direct control over it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:29:15
Anyone can create a fork and ask others to use it. I don't see anything draconian about that.

It was a "regular transaction", with 1 input and 2 outputs, like all transactions I make (and used to confirm in at most 1h for that amount).
Moreover, I set the fee to 2x what my wallet suggested. This kind of user experience is really bad and needs to be fixed asap.
FYI, Total bytes: 225
@_date: 2017-04-23 16:40:24
I sent a transaction with a ~70 cents fee on Friday and got a confirmation 7h later.
EDIT: my transaction had 225 bytes

Labeling XT an altcoin and using your power to help one of the sides of the debate to win is, IMHO, way worse than what aquentin did.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:51:22
And the relationship to bitcoin is...
@_date: 2016-10-22 11:53:14
I am wondering what is going on with this sub. Maybe moderators should consider treating these kinds of posts the same way they (used to) treat bitcoin xt posts

I tried expedia. They only accept Bitcoin and Paypal for hotels. Flight tickets can only be purchased with debit/credit cards. Source:

Dan Ariely suggested sending money to a charity that supports a cause you disagree with. That is going to give you even more incentive to wake up.
@_date: 2016-05-19 05:30:59
Yeah. You just scan a QR code and push a button. There is just too much friction involved with entering a credit card number + name (as it appears on your card) + expiration date + CVV. Jeez, I am suprised I had never realized this.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:51:09
Indeed, Brasileiro. I am also optimistic about our country. I used to live in the US, moved back to Brazil in 2013, exactly when things began to go south, and I do't regret it
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:44:01
Yep. Out of necessity, instead of fanboyism
@_date: 2016-07-16 02:00:04
On top of that, a bunch of them had stakes on business that would profit from bitcoin going up, so they wanted to believe it was going to go up
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:37:01
I didnt say bitcoin doesnt protect against it. I just dont see it as "bitcoin news".
OTOH, I would have found it interesting if it had mentioned that Venezuelans are buying bitcoin due to hyper inflation
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:28:30
you actually did. You have less resources available to you. "Money" (in terms of dollars) is just a perspective
