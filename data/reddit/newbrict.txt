wow that makes perfect sense.... but I think I've already screwed myself here... basically I have 3 transactions:
unspent gets spent once here:
unspent gets spent here:
this leaves me with exactly 0 balance in my wallet, and 3 transactions which are kinda chained together and 0 mbtc which I can spend from tx output unconfirmed....
is this the right interpretation?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:45:16
Is it malicious intent that someone is rebroadcasting my transaction?

the way this contract is written is very smart from Roger side. Basically he lost hope in s2x and the only reason he took this bet is because it could actually kick start it, 100 blocks was unlikely l... until you out 6m on the line now there is big incentive for the bitcoin end of the deal to mine s2x at least to get 100 blocks, but if that puts the illusion of adoption on it could actually make b2x more attractive to users who wouldn't have switched otherwise

i guess it's open to interpretation, my interpretation is stock market was over values, bubble burst, people ran to get money from banks which were overleveraged so banks failed. increasing the currency supply just devalues the currency, and it's just a way to fill the currency bubble to mask the bursting of the other bubbles...
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:23:12
if you're saying the amount of currency "couldn't account for the amount of wealth in the economy" doesn't that mean that the price of "stuff" was higher than it should have been?

when you mine you try to solve transaction block hashes under the current difficulty.
when someone in your pool successfully hashes the block correctly, the block generates bitcoins ( currently 25 ) and pays it to the miner ( your pool )
then your pool splits it among all the miners

once your wallet syncs everything will show up. you just have to download the block containing the transaction to that address

Happiness is an odd creature. People always say "Money can't buy happiness" however the lack of money can surely bring distress. Bitcoins make people happy, for various reasons selfish and selfless. Although I haven't lived to see as many years as you have and my comment was initially meant to be taken humorously I do think that Bitcoins can make the world a better, happier place. Financial freedom is something many people never had the chance to have, and now it's possible thanks to Satoshi :)

awesome :)

It's pretty much impossible to work out the key,
You're better off mining that trying to work out the key lol ( profit wise )
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:11:17
well then start mining if you don't mind working your gpus,
you have nothing to lose
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:24:21
well, the qr code or whatever you're using on paper would translate to the .dat file
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:22:27
The bitcoin network has transaction fees
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:05:22
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:32:55
you should be aware that bitcoin is volatile
and fun as hell
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:40:12
just accept bitcoins, that's all you gotta do man
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:39:46
Obviously, if there's no cost to making money that's arbitrage man
if you have to pay for auxiliary hardware then it's something else
buy asics

btcprice is 540 on btce, 580 on mtgox
nothing is happening, go back to your cave.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:31:13
do them.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:06:48
what a dick head
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:26:02
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:19:42
Well, then I was wrong :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:45:31
most likely the latter
but either way you're probably fine but if you're paranoid....
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:27:06
Why post then?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:55:39
gold is finite, the idea is that we can't just produce more gold at will, not that we can't mine more.
mining requires there be a supply of gold within the area you're mining, if you mine it all, you have to find a new mine, which becomes increasingly hard.
just like bitcoins, the more you mine, the harder it becomes to mine.

How did he get the usernames of the people on the subreddit?
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:46:55
do it
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:08:59
You won't make anything.
The power you spend will be orders of magnitude more expensive than what you'll get mining with a mac
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:00:14
where can you send $100M for 23 cents?
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:44:34
why would anyone tell the truth
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:54
it's an authentication method without having to sign up on their site directly
You need to use openID or google login or another method
I recommend google auth ( sign in via your gmail )
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:27:09
His acting is hilarious
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:34:56
just don't do it again
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:03:57
If that's what you want to do then do it. You could lose some, you could make some. Asking for financial advice here is a bad idea
