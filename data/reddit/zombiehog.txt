Goddamnit. I really did not want to use their internal wallet, but the fees to the external were just too much for my small op. RIP my .025 BTC, i was 25% of the way to getting to my cash out point. This sucks :(

Ok gotcha thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:02:25
Well, maybe we can all thank you for it going up!

It's a sale for me! Been waiting a week to finally buy
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:45:29
I'm interested as well
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:02
I've been waiting to buy, sure glad I'm paying $6600 instead of $7600

I have no idea what those acronyms mean

Also Coinbase here, easy to use and they are legit. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:22:45
Coinbase is the gold..err..BTC standard

You like your Trezor? I'm thinking of getting one or the Ledger nano S. After I scrape together enough fiat for .1 BTC first haha.

Awesome thanks! One question, I have a limit order open on GDAX for .0299 BTC at $210 (I know, I know, but it's all I can afford at the moment). This equates to $7,023.4 $ per BTC, the price briefly dipped below this point but my order didn't go through. Any idea why, did I do something wrong?

A few major retailers have recently started accepting bitcoins, Newegg and Overstock (and others). There have been rumors about amazon taking it soon, and most believe that is only a matter of time.

Hitting the front page of reddit is quite a bit different from plumbers talking about stocks. Maybe when your grandma starts talking about day trading BTC that is a warning sign.

Actually you totally can, just buy a fraction of a BTC. Super easy and there is absolutely no distinction. If you want to buy $100, buy $100 worth and then if/when BTC hits $20,000, you'll double your money just the same.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:39
Might end up doing that, buying a little bit each $100 drop
