I think that might be because the last difficulty change was a drop in difficulty, of like 2% or something. But this time its a gain, and from what i can tell looks like a pretty substantial one. Im no expert though

Yo if he’s into crypto he’s probably subscribed to this sub. Wouldn’t be my first choice if I wanted to steal his shit without him knowing. Good luck on your quest though

Coinspot typically has the most inflated prices, so good for selling, but you need to sell using their “market” section to avoid huge fees. Otherwise coinjar recently opened up their exchange and its really nice with low fees, they suffer from low liquidity though as it’s new.

Garlic will beat bitcoin
Garlic, when planted leads to more garlic. If you plant bitcoin nothing happens 
Therefore garlic is a better investment choice. Buy garlic

Another thing to consider and the ato considers is motivation. If you were given btc as a gift, and you have less than $10k AUD worth, you can sell without declaring tax

I would have quit my job if I made $5. Being a doctor sucks
