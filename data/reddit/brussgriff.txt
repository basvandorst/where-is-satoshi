Move your BTC to Coinbase's GDAX exchange. You can send BTC with no fees from there.

2fa codes are usually still valid for a couple of minutes even after they change. to account for things like sluggish network connectivity, etc.

It's the other way around: Blockchain relies on Bitcoin.

Coinbase is able to work with banks because Brian Armstrong chose to follow the rules and take a "slowly-but-surely" approach instead of the "quick &amp; dirty" path favored by unsuccessful competitors.

A lot longer than most people here are willing to admit. It would be the height of irresponsibility to quickly roll out something of this scale and complexity, esp. considering the unique level of regulatory compliance and customer growth strains they currently face. Luckily for their users, Coinbase prioritizes security and stability over adopting quick-fix band-aid solutions in a mad rush to placate the loudest complainers.

ah, good to hear that!

So it's good to let Comcast decide which parts of the Internet I can see?

Yubikey announced a serious security vulnerability a few months ago. Details and instructions to mitigate the flaw here, for those who were not aware:

You left out security. Activating new innovations is guaranteed to expand the attack footprint and increase risk. Your dream exchange sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. I trust Coinbase because they prioritize extreme caution instead of pandering to their most impatient customers.

The fact that you believe Coinbase could "easily start batching if they wanted to" indicates you lack experience in retooling mission-critical software infrastructure at tremendous scale in the midst of other pressing demands and disruptions.

It sounds like you're the one who wants war.

Implementing SegWit is guaranteed to increase the risk of unexpected instabilities throughout such a large-scale operation as Coinbase. I do not want Coinbase to put my transactions at risk just so they can say they jumped on the "early adopter" train of a new, untested technology.

The current slowdowns and high fees are just temporary growing pains due to mania-induced buying sprees. Solutions are in the works.

The less experienced and knowledgeable you are in the cryptocurrency space, the more likely you will lose any funds that you try moving or storing yourself. 
Coinbase is trustworthy and mature and well insured. They put security above all else. You are much better off entrusting Coinbase to safely store your funds until you've gained the confidence and expertise necessary to secure any funds all by yourself. 
Don't be scared by talk of Mt Gox or other such scams and frauds. 
Coinbase is a cut above the rest when it comes to legitimacy.

I'd request your full credit report at all 3 credit reporting bureaus. If they have inaccurate info about you, it will mess up identity verification for you anywhere, not just at Coinbase.

You may want to consider recalibrating your expectations if you think Coinbase should operate as smoothly as Chase bank at a time like this.

Arguably, the "insane cult" has hindered Bitcoin's success more than it has helped.

So the receiving system must support particular features for it to work, but you haven't heard of any problems yet. That doesn't sound reassuring.
