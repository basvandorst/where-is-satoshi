This is a fairly standard transaction. When combining multiple outputs into a single transaction it generally looks like this.

CoinWallet.eu is new and currently has minimal customer assets. The absurd notion that stress testing the Bitcoin blockchain is a scam is laughable. If sending a large number of Bitcoin transactions is a scam then I have greatly misunderstood the purpose of Bitcoin.

Thank you for pointing this out. It has been corrected.

Anyone who says that there is not a crisis is ignoring the fact that a few individuals performing a test managed to cripple the entire system for 8 hours just a few days ago.

We should also mention that most Bitcoin transactions with standard fees took 3 hours to confirm. The total amount spent on fees was approximately 3 BTC.

Yes, this is true. In total we spent less than 2 BTC in fees but managed to create a backlog of more than 2 hours for standard fee transactions and 13 hours for low fee transactions. A full analysis has been posted at

Our initial experiment has ended and a secondary experiment was conducted today. In a few moments, additional details will be posted about the next major stress test.

Were you scammed by that test too?

Perhaps, however our stress test does not involve "Low fee spam". Instead it involves standard fee spam.

The test has been postponed until tomorrow, June 30th.
