Let's run with Batman.
Robin did.

It's being largely ignored in the media here. Except on Russia Today, specifically Max Keiser | maxKing -s -w -i -f -e -I
The English speaking world however is uneasy at the prospect of pseudo anonymously conducting digital transactions with a trade embargoed country... whichever side you bat for.
This is not just a matter of profit, currency is one of the central pillars that keep the roof over a democracy's head, and shelter is another.
Free energy looms on the horizon, the winner of that hardware race wins the blockchain.
It's strange how governments have not much considered this particular proposition.
Thank you for *ahem* listening.

A mere blip in Bitcoin history. Nothing to worry about.

That answered my question then really.

"This would mean that we start getting blocks mined every 20 minutes on average instead of 10 minutes. "
I'm sorry but how did you arrive at that conclusion?

And difficulty would remain the same on average would it?
(From 
"For reasons of stability and low latency in transactions, the network tries to produce one block every 10 minutes. Every 2016 blocks (which should take two weeks if this goal is kept perfectly), every Bitcoin client compares the actual time it took to generate these blocks with the two week goal and modifies the target by the percentage difference. This makes the proof-of-work problem more or less difficult. A single retarget never changes the target by more than a factor of 4 either way to prevent large changes in difficulty. "
So I guess I'm asking if he's right about how many miners we lose, which is by no means certain but let's agree 50% as our hypothesis, how many retargets would it take to get back to a 10 minute block time?

Because nobody would believe him, because they colluded from the very start to "kick him into the long grass", I'm surprised none of you "exceptionally bright" CS students worked out Ted's 2014 "long grass" comment.
It was a fucking stitch up.
There were no keys at the start, it was shared with a community, who derided the idea, stole it, and then codified it after they made sure the originator of the idea was throughly discredited.
MIT are the scum of the earth.

It's obvious Gavin is a fucking liability based purely on his choice of haircut.
