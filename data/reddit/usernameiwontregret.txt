As a former professional gambler it reminds me of this quote from Dan Harrington. 
“You will make the most amount of money when you do the opposite of what everyone else is doing”. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:38:34
You’re right. 
Ultimately there’s nothing cryptocurrency can do that current payment services don’t already do better. 
I think a lot of crypto enthusiasts overestimate blockchain technology, and the value of these coins. They’re fixing a problem that doesn’t exist, or at least are problems only considered problems by very few. 
I’m an economist and I see crypto actually going back in time. Centralization and intermediaries are economic evolutions that were fought for for centuries, similar to private property rights. Again, I believe most crypto enthusiasts don’t understand the importance of centralization to the economy. 
Imagine global markets fluctuating on a daily basis, needing to transfer from coin to coin depending on what you’re doing. 
Cryptocurrency makes the process more complicated, whereas people are saying it’s making it easier. 
If I’m being honest, I’m only in on it to make easy money while the barrel’s hot.

Care to explain from your perspective? Even if it’s short. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:32:21
Decentralization is its greatest weakness in fact. 
Less security, higher fees, plus the core bubble of it ultimately not being worth anything to anyone significant. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:24:27
So pretty much you just explained the only upside is sticking it to the man. 
Well what about things like bitconnect? Scams and uncertainty that come with an unregulated market?
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:05:09
Yeah I’m not paying $8 for a cup of lemonade sorry.
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:36:34
Reading crypto enthusiasts come up with “ahah! Gotcha!” type points really shows a fundamental lack of understanding of economics. It’s embarrassing at times. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 21:30:55
Not what I meant but even I would take it that way, terrible phrasing on my part. 
Sorry for calling you a retard. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:57:58
Okay so you’re kind of like me, an investor not someone looking for the tech per se. 
But what about people that want to buy the currency to *use* it? For them being nickel and dimed must be pretty rough, you must admit. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:40:29
I think the fees are what many would consider to be exorbitant. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:36:59
Okay you guys are retards I never said this is how I felt I said this is why people say they don’t like Binance. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:38:00
We were talking about the time before BNB existed. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:14:19
Okay people are missing the point here. 
The SEC doesn’t care about market manipulation. 
After the Patriot Act the SEC requires all regulated markets collect personal information on EVERY single person who touches the market. This is why when you sign up for a brokerage you need to give them your SSN. 
This concept is impossible with crypto, as it defeats the purpose. 
And to people saying crypto doesn’t need an ETF, that’s silly and truly shows that you don’t understand the investment side of things. 
Most investors aren’t here for the technology, they’re here for the money, and an ETF would greatly increase crypto exposure as it would allow people who don’t really understand it to invest confidently anyway. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:04:41
But crypto coins are not just pure commodities. Many coins hold a significant amount of coins for themselves. I would argue coins are more similar to stocks than commodities. And investors drive adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:58:59
I get that, but to me that makes an ETF just for Bitcoin pretty damn useless. 
But if that’s the loophole used to get it traded in the US then I suppose it makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:37:16
Literally nobody said that. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:12:36
“Something seeking to take over the world and become the next big thing doesn’t need investors”
Yeah, okay. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 21:40:15
Okay so I reread the chain and I remember what I was talking about. 
The withdrawal fees are ridiculous. And when they just freeze a coin so you can’t withdraw every now and then. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:40:04
I don’t understand why people call it a “Bitcoin ETF” they should be calling it a “crypto ETF” as an ETF is made up of multiple stocks, currencies, etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:41:30
You must not be an experienced investor then because the fees are ridiculous. 
And you must not have been around for the dust era on Binance where you could have hundreds of dollars in dust and nothing you could do about it.

Past performance doesn’t indicate future performance.
@_date: 2018-10-17 10:17:37
Maybe instead of worrying about whether or not it’s propaganda we should worry first about whether or not it’s true. 
If true, this should be concerning for future adoption. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:50:34
It wasn’t monetary policy that caused the Great Depression, it was fiscal policy. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:14:05
Really has nothing to do with Keynesian economics. 
Controlling the monetary supply through calculated printing of currency, issuing of bonds, and adjustment of interest rates is very different from just straight up changing the exchange rate of your currency which China can do since they’re communist.
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:42:51
Bitcoin fees are way higher than CC fees lmao.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:25:30
Not nearly the same. 
What hurts me is the glaring lack of understanding of economics and finance most crypto holders have.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:39:23
What tf are you talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:34:43
Inflation *is* good for the economy. Inflation *is* what keeps the economy moving. Currencies are not meant to be investments, they’re meant to be used. The way you encourage people to *use* their currency is to make it slowly depreciate over time. This way people can’t just hoard their excess money and have it be worth more in the future. It’s actually integral to an efficient economy to have an inflating currency, because that ensures that every dollar is being used and allocated. 
I don’t understand how people say inflation hurts the poor and helps the banks. It’s actually the complete opposite. 
If the banks were going to rig the rules to benefit them and rich people, wouldn’t they actually want a deflating currency? That way they can just in a way make money by literally doing nothing, and waiting. But inflation forces the hand of the rich people, who have the excess money, to invest it in the economy, to innovate and create jobs. Therefore the money doesn’t sit in rich people’s bank accounts, it finds its way into the pockets of the working class. 
There’s a reason why every economist and financier knows that inflation is a good thing. There’s a reason why every central bank strives for inflation. And it’s not some global conspiracy to fuck over the poor.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:15:35
Apparently not because no one understands why inflation is good for a currency. I'd say they have a less than Econ 101 understanding of money and monetary history/theory. They're right for the wrong reasons.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:14:53
I know I'm probably going to look like a massive asshole for saying this, but I've been sitting here for about ten minutes trying to grapple with how to respond, and I just can't. 
So much of your reasoning and so many of your conclusions are just completely based on false pretenses. I can tell that you're not letting the clues guide you to the answers, but you think you know the answers and you're selectively using clues to imply you're right. 
You have some good points, about the rich being invested in assets that are inflation proof. But you don't seem to see that that's a self-fulfilling good thing for the economy as I explained. I can see that behind these paragraphs you want rich people to be evil. You use terms like "banks" and "corporations" and "public spending" with only a surface understanding of what they are, and not the spider webs that are beneath the surface.
For example, central banks giving out loans is actually a contractionary measure. Imagine the FED loans out $1mil with a 10% interest rate. When the loan is repaid ultimately $100,000 with have been removed from the money supply. 
There's thousands of these nuances that go into economics which is why it's hard for most people to understand. They'd rather things be simple, and it frustrates them when it's not as simple as they think.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:14:38
Wait are people still not acknowledging that Jan 2018 was a bubble?
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:03:17
Sorry but shut up. 
I hate these romanticized ideals of ‘decentralization’ and ‘autonomy’, it all just shows a complete lack of understanding of economic development throughout history. 
I’m a heavy investor in crypto, and believe in it greatly. But for different reasons. 
You want to know crypto’s biggest use case? International trade. Holy hell how important this is to businesses. 
But a sovereign currency will never be adopted widely. That would mean a complete and utter collapse of our current economy. It should be meant to compliment, not replace. 
To answer his question, money. 99% of investors are here for the money, and there’s certainly massive potential to make absurd amounts of it. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:43:37
I don't think that's true atm. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:37:47
You’re right, VeChain is. If I’m entirely honest I’m only in on BTC because it’s dominance is more than half.

Economics has about as many theories as other sciences. Psychology, sociology, astronomy, even physics are all mostly made up of theories. 
And markets are not necessarily the same as economies. It’s like comparing an apple to an orange.

Something is only worth something if everyone agrees it is worth as much. 
Gold has been considered very valuable since the beginning of human history. Therefore it’s a safe standard. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:36:45
The only people who don’t accept economists as scientists are leftists who still believe in socialism/communism. 
Economics is one of the oldest sciences out there dating back to Ancient Greece. It’s older than the study of physics. 
Economics creates models that reflect the reality we witness. Very similar to mathematics and physics and biology, etc. 
It is testable and the effects are observable. When countries implement policy we can observe the effects that policy caused. 
It is consistent. Certain policies work and others do not and that holds constant over thousands of years, time after time. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:55:34
I see where you’re coming from but I would say the stark difference is where the economists are coming from. 
Im my experience there are two different economists. Those from academia, and those from the business world. 
Those from academia tend to be very left leaning and theoretical in nature. Where’s those from the business world tend to be right leaning and very empirical in nature. 
I guess the reason I get so irritated is because of the things those from academia are saying. To me denying much of what I see on a daily basis is infuriating. 
To round out this conversation I guess I now understand what you’re saying here, and in my mind I jumped to the defense of my side of a rather complicated discipline. 
Good talk though, better than most I have on reddit. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:35:01
No it’d be like saying I understand how the body works but not how individual cells work, which is entirely possible. That’s why in economics we have two major divides. That between macro and micro and that between long run and short run. The harder of the two is long run macro economics that we observe over generations. For example, we know communism doesn’t work because we’ve observed the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. Whereas we may not know how the meat market will react next month to a policy implemented today. 
The difference revolves around uncertainty and the economic principle of long run averages. 
There’s actually more factors and more uncertainty in the short run than the long run. Because fads come and go. 
People complain that trickle down economics doesn’t work, even though evidence clearly shows it does work. Not next year, but in the next decade or so. 
Economics is comparable to evolution. You can’t really observe or count differences today but you can certainly do it over generations. 
Would you, by extension of your logic, not consider evolution a scientific fact?

What network? What runs on the Bitcoin blockchain? What are you talking about? If Bitcoin were to disappear tomorrow nothing in the world would change other than investors would be out of money.
Let me ask you this. Since you’re so sure Bitcoin will be so successful. When I go to the grocery store and checkout, I can use cash for no fees, or I can use a card for no fees. Why would I use Bitcoin which would cost a $5 fee just to use? Why would I buy a $5 latte with bitcoin and pay double the cost because of fees? This cannot change, will never change, and will be Bitcoin’s downfall.
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:59:35
Reserve. However, that doesn’t translate into growth from this very moment.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:33:25
Your comparison is just flat out wrong. 
Bitcoin is not the internet in this comparison here. Blockchain is. There’s this completely wrong thought that’s common that there exists a thing called the first mover advantage. That advantage does not exist. The first mover in any emerging market rarely, if ever, succeeds in the end. Peter Thiel, one of the co-founders of PayPal, along with Elon Musk mind you, states that it’s not the first mover, but the last mover that succeeds. This is because the later movers are able to identify and fix all of the problems that the first mover could not have foreseen. Satoshi Nakamoto had never foreseen transactions costing several dollars and taking multiple hours to send. The cryptosphere is still so relatively young that the cost for Bitcoin to fall and others to rise is nothing. Nothing. I don’t think Bitcoin will fail, it will become digital gold. But it will never be the foremost P2P cryptocurrency. The most likely successor is Nano.
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:57:31
I hope you know that *people* driven revolutions across all sectors typically don’t work out right? Typically is generous. They never work out. To think crypto will be any different is naive.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:07:27
With Nano no one pays fees. 
And the lightning network has become a meme because developers are starting to realize it’s impossible. They’ve been saying it’s right around the corner for years now. It’s a joke. It’s okay to admit you’re scared that you picked the wrong investment, because you did.

@_date: 2018-12-24 02:09:27
This is the biggest problem I face speaking with people who are pro-crypto. They're on the right track for the wrong reasons. 
I got a degree in economics and I can say there's a reason it's a whole degree and not just one class you take. The economy is way more complex than most people understand. Like when people talk about central banks as if they control everything, whereas they dictate fiscal policy and the treasuries dictate monetary policy in order to maintain balance and separation of powers. 
The lists and misunderstandings and conflations just go on and on. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:31:07
I agree the brand recognition is huge, but so was AOL back in the early days of the internet. If you were to tell people 15 years ago AOL wouldn’t exist in 15 years they wouldn’t believe you. 
I think bitcoin will continue to live but as a reserve currency, not as a p2p currency.
