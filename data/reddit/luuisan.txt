I followed your lead and talked to them to sell my music on bit/tracks too. [It was aired just yet]( and I hope to get my first payment anytime soon!

Someone must have shut down my computer, later I'm gonna seed from other computers.

I really hope so! And I put the CC license, I don't know where it displays on Frostwire though.
I tried the new feature at the same moment I heard about it, just seemed everything I always wanted to "sell" my music, my work. Money is not the same to everybody, so 100USD can be very valuable to someone, and to another is just a night out, for that I always found hard to put a price. With easy tipping features like this one, who wants to "buy", who wants to sponsor some artist, can do with the amount his/her desire says, not what the owner of the store says.
I hope you like the music either. (;

I'm waiting for bandcamp to accept in bitcoin too.

This is awesome, man. I'm also an indie musician and trying my way through bitcoin too. 
You can also [share your music via torrent and ask for donations with Frostwire](

Well, I like [this piece very much]( and the whole cycle is beautiful.
