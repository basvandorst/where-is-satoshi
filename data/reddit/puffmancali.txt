lots of countries are borrowing too much. most nations' debt levels are huge, and the only way they'll service these debts is to print more money. more printing of a currency hurts its purchasing  power. what insane about that logic?

jk but actually this is super interesting chart you've posted

i agree it is all relative, and the nice thing is that bitcoin has a capped total supply, so we have a hedge against inflation. i may indeed be a fuckstick but i do agree with a lot of experts that we are late-cycle, and we are due for a large economic downturn. The global economy has not really recovered from the 2008 crash - central governments have just been printing 10's of trillions of dollars with their Quantitative Easing programs, which has propped up stock markets and allowed the banking system to continue as it was before. we're just beginning to see the inflation that's coming - and yes, even for the us dollar

If governments do try to confiscate Gold today I'd love to see the uproar on social media

Super smart! If each lottery had only one winner, that would be the perfect solution. However, we want to allow for multiple winners each round, and also keep the hour\-long rounds. Editing your suggestion a little, I think I've found a solution. When the round ends, I'm going to seed my random number generator with the block hash of the most recently confirmed block. \(I'll use this node package to do this: [ Then I will sort the ticket holders in a deterministic fashion \(alphabetically by username\). Then I will run the same selection algorithm that I currently have. Since I'm using a seeded pseudorandom generator from a reliable source of entropy, anyone can run the same code and verify the payouts. So, say the round ends at 2pm, and the most recent block was confirmed at 1:53pm. Technically, somebody could figure out the winners at 1:53pm \- however, all they could do with this information is possibly purchase more tickets. But purchasing tickets requires another block confirmation, which will change the payouts. If another block gets confirmed at 1:58pm, then the payouts will change entirely. So I think this system would work, and be provably fair. Thoughts? I really appreciate your input \- it's awesome to have a smart mind to run this by. I'll throw you some free tickets on the site if you'd like as well, as a thank you for your input

gotcha, i'll keep that in mind. thanks for your help, you have a sharp mind

Where did you see 20 percent? That's incorrect \- but if our site is confusing we can make the appropriate changes.

Thanks for pointing this out \- we're working on a solution that doesn't compromise the security of our site. We are definitely open to hearing suggestions. We want to do something like Bustabit does, described here: [
We were thinking we generate a similar chain of 10 million or so SHA256 hashes \(similar to what is described in the link\), and use each entry in this chain as the random seed for the selection algorithm for that round. Then anyone can verify after the round that the result are true by running our same selection algorithm starting with the random seed from the hash chain. Since anyone can purchase tickets, there would be no way for us to precisely fix the order of UTXO's  for our Xpub. So combining that with the verifiable random seed, I think that would be provably fair? We are open to hearing suggestions because we want to do this correctly

Yeah great point about the ambiguity of which block is latest. Not sure how to solve that. Luckily it's a pretty rare edge case: two blocks would have to be found within ~10 seconds of each other at nearly exactly the end of the hour. And then we'd only have two possible outcomes to choose from. Definitely open to hearing any solutions to this though, if anyone can think of anything
Edit: actually the ambiguity might not be an issue, given that blocks are timestamped, and each round definitively ends exactly on the hour.

Right now 5&amp; is reserved for Bitcoin transaction fees and house cut. So if Bitcoin fees are 1&amp; then we take 4&amp;

something to consider is using bip39 plus a passphrase as the mnemonic 'salt'. so you can store your 24 words somewhere, but to decode your master private key, you need the 24 words and the passphrase. So you could keep the 24 words on paper and keep the separate passphrase in your head. If an attacker finds your 24 words, they would need to brute force attack or guess your passphrase to decode your master private key. passphrase can be as simple or complex as your want. you can then use bip32 on this master seed to derive many addresses. not sure if this is what you're looking for, but thought it would be worth mentioning

good point - government money has become bankster money

this is correct. every "bitcoin" that exists is spendable, and therefore is in the UTXO set.

I was looking into this and I’m still not totally sure how electrum implements this custom word. It should be somewhere in the electrum documents, but I couldn’t find it with a quick search.

i think the unsatisfying answer is run your own full node and audit the software you're running

smartbit has a pretty good api: [ you can write a script to download all the blocks, then write a script that goes through and audits every transaction in history
