Btc will lose a lot of steam to alts this year as the market gets greedier. Depending on how much money you invest, take a risk with low-medium market cap alts and keep a store of value with btc.

And he likes XRP, the bank coin. Says everything we need to know about that guy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:04

What’s wrong with saying the Asians? They are people that live in Asia.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:21:54

@_date: 2017-12-29 21:31:22
What a joke. XRP is the enemy 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:25:38
What is there to talk about technical wise in regards to bitcoin when there’s thousands of transactions still backlogged?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:27:32
B-b-but brand recognition brooo
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:01:55
Just buy alts with ETH pairing brah
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:29:03
Congrats on your centralized bank coins. SUB will give way better returns than this jew kike bank coin in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:31:32
Enjoy waiting another 200 billion to 2x!
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:12:14
What is the real shitcoin, slow 35$ fees? Lmao. Alts are superior tech.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:04:39
It’s a voluntary reserve.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:27:49
Sorry BTC maximalists. It’s year of the alts and superior technology.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:25:54
Good goy! Send me your shekel address I’ll send you a shekel.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:11:12
Found the guy who doesn’t understand Blockchain tech.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:34:06
Nah I’ll enjoy my exponential gains with better tech. Thx tho 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:01:01
Alts &gt; btc. No one can argue this.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:04:03
Nah I hate central banks. Zio Khazars jews just happen to own them :/
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:47:11
Nah just calling you greedy losers out. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:11
Dude all you have to do is buy alts.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:45:22
Substratum rocketing for all you net neutrality fear mongerers 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:29:54
Is that because white men are better looking and higher testosterone and their women salivate over white cock?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:05:12
Elaborate. Yourself included as well.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:48:02
XRP is a centralized joke. Good Goy
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:50:54
Is it really a “crypto” addiction if you only hold btc?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:53:59
95% alts, other 5% for buying alts when they’re cheap
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:40:07
For all ripple holders, go have a tea with the Rothschilds you greedy losers. You’re part of the problem. Enjoy your temporary gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:23:47
Tells me the market is full of noobs trying to get rich quick. It will be a store of value for alts in the long term. Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:26:51
Of course you never heard of it, you’re ignorant to technology and the whole point of blockchain. Stay mad, I’ve 50Xd my net worth since May from alts.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:07:54
I think it has more to do with new money getting greedy and wanting a riskier return. Also the big fees for the noobs on coinbase and other initial transactions don’t help.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:15:39
Superior technology (alts) putting btc in its place. Have fun doubling your money when it hits 30K+, I’ll be 4x at least on substratum 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:32:22
Or you could just buy Substratum with your BTC
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:24:45
It is in a bubble but this bubble is at least 5 years away from popping
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:40:03
But how come when white people want to in America it’s racist. I agree, they have a sense of pride and purity which is a good thing but they are intimidated by the superior white man.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:08:55
Anyone actually believes a guy with a million dollars would have bought at the peak or not sold at the peak? Lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:36:55
That tends to be a common thing with noobs and btc maximalists.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:20
Im the messiah sent here by satoshi to tell you guys btc is a shit investment compared to alts.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:59:05
Much better alternatives already exist
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:21:31
I own 0 BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:09:14
BTC is just a store of value for alts, nothing more. The tech is inferior to several alts.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:04:28
LOL anything except bank coin XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:42:57
Helping banks = part of the problem. There’s no mental gymnastics that can justify this. Let those greedy banks create their own coin 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:58:43
Banks are obsolete with Blockchain tech. Try again 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:57:58
Here’s a shekel for the good goy! Only 19% if jews are actually Semitic by the way.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:19:20
Them fees though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:49
This is a much needed, healthy correction for the whole crypto market. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:58:13
80 alts /20 btc
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:42:20
I’m an early retiree because of crypto. How do you think I can troll all you gullible moon kids on Reddit all day?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:41:15
Stay stable for alts biiiiiiittttccccoooooiiiinnn
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:54:56
lol what? BTC will touch the 11.5k support range at worst and go up again, and I’m an alt fan. This has nothing to do with alters bashing btc, the noobs are panicking cause btc is finally correcting from a huge Q4 and they bought at the top. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:14:23
LOL I bought BTC at 330$ bud.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:29:23
Doge is better than btc
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:49:58
Don’t buy either bitcoin. Buy alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:53:41
Tax is theft
