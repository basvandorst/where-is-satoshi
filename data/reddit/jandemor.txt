If the banks are closed and the ATMs shut down, as in Cyprus, a card is useless in the real world, credit, debit, prepaid or not. I want BTCs straight into cash.

I want cash, not money in any electronic form. Good ol' physical coins and notes. I'd still have my Visa and Mastercard credit cards, but they would be of little to no use in this scenario.

Just in case. But it seems it'd be impossible unless some people with huge amounts of cash wanted to trade it for BTC. Guess who'd love that.  Internet, invent something physical for the good of mankind!!

They can't withdraw whatever they want; it's limited per day (or week, not sure about that one) per person. Same goes for foreign ATM cards. The British government sent a plane with €1 million euros *in cash* in it for their troops stationed over there.

Best reply so far.

There were several broadly informative articles, mostly presenting it as an oddity, in the main Spanish newspapers these last weeks, nothing to do with Cyprus. I would venture to say that 99.99999% of Spaniards have absolutely no idea of what Bitcoin is, much less how to get one. The average Spaniard is afraid of buying a flight on the Internet for fear that they get robbed. Most of my Spanish friends are what you'd call tech-savvy, own a couple of computers, a tablet and a smartphone, and you'd struggle to find one that has a paid app. They just won't trust their credit card details to not some dodgy Spanish company, but Google or Apple. I'm Spanish, and all of this is true. I guess I can disregard the article as utter bullshit.
