A hardware wallet has the security of cold storage and the convenience of a hot wallet.  It is both at the same time, the best of both.

Yes, but people don't want solutions.

Yes.  However, the IRS overlooks small-scale things of that nature.

On EVERY topic.  Not just the ones that you understand.

No.  Nick Szabo is not a sci-fi author.  He is a cryptographer.  The more you look into it the, the more obvious it is that  Nick Szabo = Nakamoto Satoshi.

Reddit is not neutral.

They sell the accounts to political campaigns to be used as bots/npcs.  Just look at r.politics or any of the other nutcase subreddits.

No, that isn't foolish at all.  Citizens who have resources are a threat.  The government wants to keep its citizens weak.
Just yesterday four trucks full of aid tried to get into Venezuela.  The government burnt the trucks.  The government wants to keep its people hungry, sick, and desperate.  That's socialism 101.

Being poor is expensive and disasters hit you harder, so gradually trying to work your way out of poverty relies on a lot of luck.  It makes a lot more sense to try to jump out in one play.
When you are behind, you need to take bigger risks, not smaller.  This is especially true in any society (such as the US) where you pretty much can't starve to death or die of exposure (unless you are too mentally ill to live in a shelter).  Being at rock bottom is your safety net, in the sense that things can't really get any worse.

No.  The IRS expects and tolerates a small amount of tax evasion when it comes to this kind of thing.

Age inflation too.  A 12-year-old could buy a milk truck back then.  Now 35-year-olds talk about "adulting".

You need to have your 24 words written out and kept in two safes (at different locations).  Don't use any form of encryption/passwords.

Adding a passphrase is a very bad idea.  It might seem reasonable when you are young, but it will really mess things up for you or your heirs in the future.  Which is more likely:
1) Some thief breaks into your house, breaks into your safe, has the knowledge to recognize that he is looking at a seed, go home, quickly swipe the bitcoins before you do.
2) You forget the password because you are middle-aged or older, or you suddenly die and your children are unable to access your bitcoin.  Boom, gone forever.

Which is exactly why you don't need a passphrase.  The only purpose of a passphrase is to protect against physical theft of your seed.


They don't need to know the pin; the seed is enough.  They can buy a new hardware wallet, put your seed in it, and bam: bitcoin!

On thousands of computers called "nodes".  Each node has a copy of the block chain, the ledger in which your coins are recorded.
If you want to run a node look for the piece of software called "bitcoin core".

Feel free to refute my specific points, if you can.

No, it really was obvious to everyone back then.  I heard about bitcoin in 2010 but I didn't invest because I assumed that it would be shut down in a few months.  Remember that Ron Paul ran for president in 2007-2008, so we were all very aware of the nature of currency and government.
