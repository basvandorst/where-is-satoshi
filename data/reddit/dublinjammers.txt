in ireland, there's been cases where people got turned down for mortgages because they had gambling in their bank statements, like paddy power etc. 
maybe they think it's something along those lines?

I saw a few similar things a while ago too

nope, 400+ million people using adblock, maybe a few hundred thousand actually using bitcoin as a currency. it's a drop in the ocean. i took ads off my site for a while in favour of changetip which got nothing

I'm going to be picking up my mining pool reviews this week, starting with Polmine, the Polish PPS mining pool

perfect, thanks :) enjoy a biscuit @_date: 2014-09-28 23:35:38
I just put this together to help me visualise where i can spend bitcoin in Ireland, and ahead of an attempt to try and spend 24 hours just using bitcoin for accomodation, food, drinks etc.
If any Irish redditers know any I've missed, please let me know!
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:54:06
A lot of people use them to get their first bitcoins, in my own case I started with my first bitcoin from a faucet, then went on from there to cloud mining, trading, buying antminers s1's etc. I did write an opinion piece about them from the point of view of a digital marketer at 
@_date: 2014-11-15 11:58:20
bitcoin armory desktop wallet is awesome and free
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:09:09
 in fairness, at least there's someone who's taken a punt on it in ireland, and the legal hoo-hah around the "irish atm" didn't stop them. they said there's actually a good few people going through every day asking for them. If you haven't seen this before, read it - 
Also, I rewrote the last bit so it's clear, I'll do another review of the atm process, and record the whole thing on my phone. 
 - nope, I use bitcoin armory ;p
 - i'm just waiting for the age gate plugin developer to get back to me and didn't realise i'd left it on lol, the age gate is only meant for two or three pages on the site, so I've disabled that now. faceplant

i've sourced an antminer s1 here in Dublin, so i'll be able to shortly do reviews of all the mining pools with a fixed hashing rate, to hopefully give people a benchmark!

Hi all, 
I'm not involved in the financial space at all, being a marketing guy, but I wanted to have a good, plain english, risk warning for people on my site. 
I've put up this VERY rough draft, and was wondering if someone could have a read over it and let me know if i'm missing anything obvious, or reword it to be accurate?
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:13:11
you're welcome, let me know when you add Irish stores! 
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:14:12

@_date: 2014-08-30 13:06:27
The other day, and as part of my research for setting up the site, I went to one of the pioneers of the irish bitcoin industry to buy some bitcoins in cash. I was interested to see how it would be calculated with vat. I'll be going back in a little while to try paying cash and getting btc onto my mobile wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:18:54
A lot of faucets don't have google ads, so it doesn't apply, but I've come across some who employ Google Adsense all over the place.
They state 
Invalid clicks and impressions
Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods.
Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited.
I'd say that filling in a captcha, seeing ads (before and after), and then waiting thirty minutes to do the same thing over and over again is a way to artificially inflate the impressions.
But as a marketer, if it was any other industry other than bitcoin doing this with my hard earned budget, I'd be pissed.
But with the scripts freely available, all they need to do is clone the site, reapply with a different email. I guess it's like whack-a-mole trying to enforce it
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:52:13
Gyft and egifter don't support Ireland, and while looking for a place to buy Amazon UK gift cards with bitcoin, I came across this great little site
@_date: 2014-09-01 19:03:01
There is a learning curve with it, and it might not be the sexiest of wallets, but I've found it's really easy to use. Plus documentation helps a lot
@_date: 2014-09-02 11:20:46
from experience, mining bitcoin on computer/gpu = bad idea. it'll cook your hardware and cost you more in repairs than it'll make. From someone who used to mine on a laptop, and had to spend $800 to repair it
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:28:09
I'll be running a series of tests over the next few weeks running 10ghs on a couple of different pools, to try and get a benchmark. I use btcguild and cex concurrantly, so thought I'd start with CEX on a fresh account and see what 10ghs makes you. I know there's a lot more people with thousands of times more crunching power than me, but for some miners just starting, it might be of interest
@_date: 2014-11-15 10:23:23

I'm looking for gifts I can wrap but I might do an article on that for people travelling to ireland
@_date: 2014-09-02 09:56:23
I checked the settings, I don't see an option to let you do what you want to do. You can specify the location of where bitcoin is, but i can't see a way to change the armory blockchain logo from C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Armory
I'll be honest and say that this is my first bitcoin wallet review (although I have written reviews for non-bitcoin things for a long time), and some of the features you are talking about are outside of my scope, as my reviews are meant for a relatively inexperienced user.
Maybe before I do any more, I should ask the question, what do you on reddit need a wallet to do, so when reviewing them, I can check yes or no whether they do it?
Some of the more merchant focused features are great in theory, but I will find it hard to find any location where I can test this in real life, and some of the security comments from  are more about a person's personal security arrangement. 
But I also have never personally put any bitcoin into "cold storage", so would someone here be interested in letting me know the process? Paper backups are really important, and I do say that I had to reformat my computer, and having them meant I didn't skip a beat.
But I'm taking on board all of the constructive criticism, but will flag I'm not a superuser of the software, just using it for day to day. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 13:47:42
i might get that vpn for my dad as he travels a lot, does it let you have an irish ip? Most of the gifts are for 30 year old funky women, so just trying to find unusual stuff, lads presents are easy! I've stuck 0.00475 btc on changetip though :)
@_date: 2014-11-15 11:53:07
about six were mine between mining and shopping on all4btc, and my first transaction of a size that needed a 0.0003 towards the miners :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:53:04
would they do the same if i reviewed the process of walking into gamestop and buying a physical card/code with cash?
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:28:59
well my maths =
they did the exchange at the ex vat rate, and then i as a consumer paid vat
my next question though, is if i'm a company and buying off another company selling, can i claim back the vat the same way I can if I was buying a piece of hardware. Unless it's classed as a currency legally, it's just another consumer good right?
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:39:37
As part of my series of reviews of bitcoin pools,  of this batch of 8 looks at BTC Guild. I mined with these for 6 months on leased ghs before getting my antminers, so have seen them adapt over the last months

Before I start this, I was wondering if Reddit bitcoin could let me know what their main concerns are, before joining/switching pools?
Other than the obvious, trying to find the best ROI, what else matters? Uptime? Contactability? Or do you even care? 
Let me know!
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:23:22
Part four in my reviews of the publicly joinable pools. I've edited this several times to try and not have it as harsh, but seriously disappointed

For anyone who wants to:
Split their antminer s1 power between more than 3 pools
Store lots of different pool information in their antminer s1 so they can switch between them at will
I put together this step by step guide on how to let you get more than the stock 3 mining pools.
It's let me compare all the major pools at the same time, and make a decision on whether to focus on one, or split them proportionally between lots of different pools, helping somewhat get over bad luck by getting small amounts of many blocks from different pools. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:52:34
well what is the benchmark for ease of use? Before I do any more, I'm taking feedback!

Just got a pair of antminers to review multiple pools at the same time. What kind of things are most important for miners on reddit? Luck, payout per block found, minimum cashout amount, and general reliability, or anything more? We'll be reviewing all the major and minor publically joinable pools over the next few weeks

just opened it in a new tab, chromecasted it to my tv, and minimised the tab. once it gets laggy or the screen is full, hit f5 to refresh, and it starts all over. it's like a bitcoin aquarium

i'm thinking of getting this today, just wondering quickly if it's ok at €50/$70?
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:08:56
So as part of the reviews I'm doing, I thought I'd cash out some of my mining earnings using a European exchange (and to show the missus that those four antminers can actually make real money, not just wreck her head with heat and noise!)
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:52:58
thanks! I had a good experience with them, and hope to do some more reviews for other exchanges as I go on :)

go raibh maith agat (thanks in irish) :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:32:51
it says it's unconfirmed transactions, so I don't think it has anything to do with mining
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:19:31
i wonder how many of the early day bitcoins are sitting there forgotten/lost or abandoned
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:22:22
i'm sure there's plenty of hidden gems like this buried in the blockchain
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:23:52
i just found something even more awesome. move the tab away, give it three or four minutes for a load of transactions to go through. When you go back to the tab, it's like there's a mushroom cloud/supernova until they all link together. just looks like all those tiny bugs in pondwater to me :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:24:08
All these assume every block will be 20mb, i think it'll be a long time before blocks regularly max this capacity
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:13:28
Get it onto one or the other, paper wallet or trezor +1 but that takes a while to arrive 
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:04:18
just realised this is against the subreddit's rules, honest mistake so i'm deleting the post
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:52:03
Thanks, I'm trying :)
Just bought an antminer locally here, so i'll be able to review a fixed hash rate across all the mining pools and hope to share my results on reddit.
Would you be interested in writing a short piece about it, or give me permission to use your replies here into a broader piece explaining how to do it?
I know there is a safety deposit box in Dublin now that offers cold storage, but it would be great to do something about how to get it ready to be put into cold storage. I'm also assuming whoever has this document owns the coins, so it would be a way to pass on bitcoins, say in a will? (i'm not a legal person, but the basic jist)
I might also be able to make some videos then around it, showing step by step how people can do this more advanced functionality.
As I said, it's my first attempt at a review, and I stuck it up here to see if I had any glaring omissions, and appreciate you flagging it!
@_date: 2015-05-07 19:03:25
no, but i did find just find out that if you left click the black part, and then pinch the mouse tracker pad (I guess ctrl+mousewheel) you can zoom out, and see where all those things are going

cool, i'll try that

I got my first meaningful fraction bitcoin after forgetting about 2.5 litecoin and selling them at $28 each. Did €600 damage to my laptop mining them, so the math doesn't add up!
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:55:08
that what it was like mining on a GPU, but you can get second hand kit to get you started for about $200 dollars these days. It won't make you a millionaire, but certainly enough to make something for a hobbiest, or testing
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:35:40
and if you click no at the start, it goes to all4btc

A lot of the wiki's are out of date, so I put together this short overview for new miners about what PPS is

@_date: 2017-03-15 23:01:04
Yep, way too risky, just buy Bitcoin rather than paying for a cloud mining contract that may or may not deliver 
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:07:56
+1  on breadwallet to hold your coins for the moment. Not sure for ethereum though. You'll have the lowest fees using an exchange, I've use eu based coinmate.io for a long time, or more established ones like bitstamp
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:43:27
Yes, to transmit the transaction to the ATM so you can get cash out
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:58:01
Don't! You'll just damage your computer like I did 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:42:23
Yep, more lads than games! Only about 5% ladies there

Just met someone tonight who said something similar, didn't realise he could get started with a tenner to learn the basics of wallets, etc
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:42:03
If you keep encrypted backups and don't mind a pc on 24/7 sure why not! Get something like bread wallet on your phone for day to day transactions though
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:02:03
There's a few places around it you'll get 20% to 30% less than the market rate 
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:53:54
i had stopped mining there, but had a bit of carry over, so they cleared that. probably for accounting then
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:46:14
I tried sending a zero fee transaction a few weeks ago and it did confirm, but was nearly a week. Depends on how big the backlog is I guess 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:06:55
had a tiny amount of bitcoin left on my mining account, and today noticed a tiny payment (like &lt;0.000001). Checked the transaction, and it was part of a zero fee, 852 bitcoin transaction. Looks like they've cleared a load of their tiny accounts down to zero.
but should a transaction like this confirm with no fee?

Hi all,
I've had a risk warning on my website for some time which I've updated this week (in line with advertising guidelines in my country).
It would be great to get some community feedback so the document is clear for newcomers, and existing bitcoin users.
I've tried to keep it really plain English, rather than filling it with jargon.
@_date: 2016-06-30 00:21:46
reads pretty well, obviously a lot of steps in it.
Could you update 5 and/or 6 in part 1
Once you have printed off your wallet, to best ensure it lasts many years, laminate the pages, and store them somewhere secure. This will ensure that you, or others authorized by you (ie kids in the future) can use the paper  wallets when the time comes, and they won't be ripped.

Hi all,
There's one day left before  closes, and we'll be doing the draw for the final set of rewards, 5x 0.05 bitcoin, and then 0.5 bitcoin for one additional person.
All the info is at  and it's in these languages
Arabic | English | Finnish | French | German | Italian | Polish | Romanian | Russian | Spanish | Turkish | Chinese
The link to the survey is at the top of each language's page.
The funds are at  and a signed message is up at 
Results of this survey are going to be published on our site, bitcointalk, bitcoin.com and here on reddit, so anyone who has ten minutes, and wants a shot at one of 6 rewards we'll be distributing next week, please participate now, and share this if you can.

well the porn industry didn't adopt bitcoin like they pioneered online sales with credit cards back in the day, mainly because they can't do recurring payments.
but i know in countries where gambling is perfectly legal, going to get a mortgage and then seeing gambling deposits from your bank account is often enough reason for the banks to reject a loan.
@_date: 2016-06-19 16:39:59
, please help us hit 500 responses. 
We've already distributed 0.5 bitcoin ( already, and as I know reddit loves stupid stuff, there's a long haired mini dachshund called  doing the survey at 
I'll be publishing the results of the survey in English for everyone to see, and it's being conducted in 13 languages!
Please participate if you have about ten minutes, and want to have your say on a non paywalled public report on what people across the world think of bitcoin, in their language!

I'm based in ireland, but use uk/czech coinmate.io for my bitcoin exchange needs. takes a day or two for a SEPA transfer to go credit, but going the other way, more often than not out of ~10 bitcoin -&gt; euro sales I've done in the last month or two, over half arrived same day if I sold/withdrew them before about 11am GMT

The owners of the café have come back with a comment, that the bitcoin ATM was being hosted in their venue on a 1 year trial, and the owner of the ATM will be looking for a more suitable location to host it with higher footfall.

We love this time of year, and we're hoovering up some of the cool crypto offers available today. We've bundled up our most commonly requested services for bitcoin companies and put together a 25% discount for the next couple of days. We also have a large number of our intelligence reports which are also available with a discount.

Hi all,
I'm putting together a few events in Dublin from May onwards, part of which will be a games + blockchain hackajam with €1,000 in bitcoin up for prizes split three ways.
In preparation for this, we've a job spec live for a summer placement to help us prepare some groundwork ahead of the hackajam. Basically combine some bitcoin network API's to trigger some different things in the Unity Game Engine, and then hand this to the teams participating to let them build games around them.
If that's you, or you know someone who fits the bill, please let me know! Would be perfect for someone between 3rd and 4th year, or who graduated already as it clashes with people doing exams right now who can work in the Digital Hub.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:35:04
Could you do the blocks since and also a timer from the time stamp of that as well? Pm me if you can :)

Hi I sent a pm about this if you can check and get back to me

i've tried several, blockchain web wallet and bitcoin armory on desktop. But it's still not accepting them, I guess I had several addresses and there's a ton of them. I know I originally would have exported them from bitcoin core, and probably password protected them. So just trying to reverse the process
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:26:12
yeah, i'm using armory these days, but just not sure which part of the key I open with notepad++ to copy into it
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:05:03
how often is this actually used?
@_date: 2015-04-10 10:31:28
it's an interim report, the survey is ongoing over at  and I have Spanish and German localisations I'm going to be releasing shortly in to broaden the sample, and get opinions on most of central and south america, as well as europe and north africa. I'm also advertising the survey at female bitcoin users to bring up the number of respondents. But the goal at the end is to get 1000 responses by the end of May
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:08:08
A couple of reasons, firstly most people I've spoken to locally who have incorporated bitcoin into their website, might have had one or two sales through it at the start, but basically have 0% of their ongoing sales with it.
Secondly, when it comes to real life places, locally again there's a couple of places that say they accept bitcoin. But only one has staff actually trained and things ready should the rare person come in who wants to spend it. Most of the other places I've gone into that have the bitcoin accepted sticker, either didn't have it booted up, or weren't trained on using it. So I just paid cash instead
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:35:39
I can’t code ;p
@_date: 2015-04-10 10:33:21
The questions in the survey didn't ask that, but most people said they've lost bitcoin at some point, either back in the day, or more recently
But over a quarter of respondants have lost bitcoin through hacks/closures, and a lot have put in amounts so I'll be able to work out an average in june
@_date: 2015-04-10 10:53:47
Nope, there's been four weeks of ongoing communication across there, relevant linkedin groups, some of the less spam filled facebook groups, twitter across a variety of hashtags (which have got as many people as bitcointalk), and the press release I put out yesterday has gotten coverage on several tech sites and one or two bitcoin ones, which will help broaden it.
there's also been advertising campaigns running internationally on and off on google and twitter. so the survey is definitely not just people from bitcointalk

Hi all,
I'm running an international bitcoin survey from the middle of March to the end of May. So far, I've had nearly 150 responses from 51 countries across the world, so I've prepared an interim report and put it up on bitcointalk
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:01:51
that's only up to 2012, like a lot of sites on that wiki, it hasn't been maintained :/
@_date: 2015-04-10 10:29:49
In Ireland at least, there are zero regulations, and I've rang revenue, central bank to check. My bank knows I work in bitcoin (which they've no problem with), but I don't sell them as a business.
The problem with the Irish bitcoin atm that got refused a bank account was because the ATM was two way I believe.

Hi all
  has 0.25bitcoin currently sitting in it's April prize pool at  . While the survey's gotten quite a lot of coverage in crypto news sites about the first interim report at The first interim report is at  , there's only been 30 responses this month, compared to the 170+ I got in March. 
At the start of May, this 0.25 bitcoin will be distributed to five respondents in April from the surveys. So you've actually got a pretty decent chance of getting one of them right now.
My target is 1,000 responses, with a German version now live, and a Spanish one to come later today or tomorrow.
The English version is in the link above and a german version is at  
If you can participate, it would be great. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:50:37
and just to clarify, I don't have the wallet.dat , just these keys
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:40:29
Betmoose let you do that kind of stuff too, but those kind of sites are when you as a person put up a bet, and others bet on it too?
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:24:32
a nice option to have!
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:38:49
new zealand in all likelyhood, hopefully Ireland, but England will probably have a good chance at home, equally Wales are strong!
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:32:01
yeah, they let me put in bets on some of the current matches, but nothing on the tournament where I could pick my country. same with bitcasino, mbitcasino and cloudbet
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:41:36
i think that's putting me in the right direction, I've found 
I'll backup armory now just in case, and then try this in core.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:34:38
thanks, i'll try there
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:09:32
cool, they do. much worse odds than directbet, but thanks a mill - 
they let you pick every country
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:03:20
there's  who buys, i'm not sure if they sell. Bitex.ie do the POS, and one of the ATM's, but again I'm not sure if they sell them. The latter is the one who had all the media coverage, so maybe get in touch with them?
@_date: 2015-09-21 09:51:16
I checked this morning, and bitcasino have odds. Way better than Predictious. I was getting 3/1 there, bitcasino gave me 8/1

In Ireland at this time of year, that is actually an option, they use less power than my blow heaters!

I have my antminers replacing my heat mats at night for my pair of bearded dragons, and in cold Irish weather, they keep the room warm overnight. Like coming into a room with underfloor heating! 
@_date: 2015-10-17 08:50:48
oops, i got those versions wrong (and edited above). .93.2 is their last public version (the right one), it just needs bitcoin .10.2
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:04:30
@_date: 2015-10-17 08:15:55
I just had to rebuild armory after switching versions, so maybe this will help. 
**will take at least an overnight**
Make sure you have armory .93.2
this uses a highest of bitcoin 0.10.2 -&gt; this isn't available on bitcoin.org, but go into Help | Update Software, and there's a version you can download there.
Also go into File | Settings and disable the bittorrent version.
Then do a factory reset, clearing all settings. Connect your laptop to a plug, and hard wire it to your router.
Wait x hours (this will be double digits) and leave laptop alone.
Come back every few hours to see it download the blockchain, build db's, then scan them.
It'll keep the wallet you've imported. If it's paper, you won't have any descriptors, but you want to get at your bitcoin.
Hope this helps!!
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:04:28
i haven't heard that before, it's polldaddy the survey's running on. If you want to pm me something you put into it, and i can dig out the incomplete survey
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:13:59
@_date: 2015-10-17 09:37:46
that could be the problem (and why I had to reinstall). The last time armory was updated was 0.10.2, so if you've too new a version of core, armory might not be able to read it.
or maybe someone else can let me know if it works with that version?
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:22:41
ahh, the paranoia. you're happy to see a local bitcoin story, stick it on and get called a shill.
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:04:20
the report will be put out publicly too, remember that!
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:38:56
The  is going well, reaching 12% of it's 1000 quota. Information is regularly being updated at 
Also, there are 5x 0.05 bitcoin prizes up for grabs for respondants in March who put a bitcoin address in the survey at the end. Those who do it later go in April's draw.
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:52:11
they're both USD only :/
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:29:58

@_date: 2015-03-19 13:51:35
i'm sure there's the same for woocommerce!
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:40:12
I've just been beta testing bitcoin armory, the new version came out yesterday 0.93 which uses core 0.10.0
The first time load speed has drastically improved compared to before. But once bitcoin was synced, it did things in about 2 and a half hours on a HDD (not ssd) , and then boot times after reboots are a few minutes syncing up to date, and then a minute to scan everything. way better, and i have my bitcoin paper wallets printed and laminated which came in handy when i had to upgrade from windows 8.1 beta to full 8.1 a while ago
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:01:12
my background is marketing, and seemed like there weren't too many people with the kind of experience I had in the bitcoin space, so been able to build up a decent chunk of my agency income with bitcoin clients... and have a ton of fun too

that's really harsh, hope it gets resolved soon!
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:10:50
wordpress + something like wp estore plugin (tips and tricks hq)  + bitpay gateway addon should do the job. there's free options, but for a couple of dollars, it's worked well for me

Thanks a lot for participating, we're going to take all the constructive feedback on the survey too, so we can improve things next year. Final count was 742, but not all of them put in bitcoin addresses, and there's six chances to win what we have at
