You forgot about all the lies not propagated by bch proponents. Do you have an agenda here?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:42:42
This is simply not true. BTC is being given the boot by merchants. A block increase is all it takes to solve the current problems, but Core won't have it because "decentralization"... but lightning is fine of course (although it's centralized).

I won't bother, I know a lost cause when I see one

RemindMe! One Year "Bitcoin market share from 60 to &lt;40%"
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:41:44
In the meanwhile, the number one post on r/BTC talks about how this feud between BTC and bch is killing both. Why not just deal with the fact that there are different visions for BTC and that for each supporter, their Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin, closest to their idea of what it should be.
If anything, this community should be pushing core devs to fix the transaction issues that are forcing dummies into xrp.....

You mean with the aim of questioning the core team's views? Just one of the ways in which Bitcoin is centralized
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:12:06
It's called the free market
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:37:49
So you recommended fiat, PayPal 2.0, the fake crypto scam created by the financial system? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:52
Question is, how much will be left after fees
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:35:52
Not if ripple wins out, then nothing will change and you can keep living in your state controlled bubble
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:24:55
One scam is being flushed out slowly and painfully, and that's Bitcoin core, because it simply doesn't work. No other reason
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:37:09
Good talk
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:19:19
NXT is already overpriced, maybe people should instead buy the main chain, ardr, 1:1 ratio, at the same price, which launches it's mainnet on 1 January, rather than than pay double the price for the Sidechain with a couple of assets

This kind of comment is what convinced me that BTC is doomed after supporting it for nearly 5 years. I never once saw what you just described. Instead of concentrating on inventing conspiracy theories, look at the fact that BTC market cap is flowing into ripple, of all things, because of how dysfunctional BTC is.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:29:37
If every person criticizing Bitcoin also sold it, it would be below 5k 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:36:01
2 years ago, we were told lightning would be here in 6 months. I repeat, they screwed up  and now it's too late.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:34:14
The bigger blocksize is all it takes to solve the problem... Satoshi himself suggested it for a reason.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:39:54
Now suddenly a blocksize increase is needed? No. It's too late.
Why now? Because what do you think Bitcoin got it's "gold standard" title from? Being innovative? No. From being the first secure, decentralized and functional currency. Now, all is left is security. I'll buy gold if that's all it has to offer.
A bit of foresight would have been nice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:23:11
BTC is so broken that people are moving to f"king ripple yet this community concentrates on blaming BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:20:03
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:50
Is it fud time? BTC is a store or value, there are many better options for payment in the crypto realm. Money has to move and BTC had to correct and maybe go bearish for a while
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:16:06
The lightning network is more centralized than anything I've seen from bch, and seems like a temporary non-fix invented out of spite. A blocksize increase doesn't make Bitcoin centralized, it makes it functional. Satoshi himself suggested it. Half of your comment is exactly what's wrong with BTC and core, arrogance and spitefulness, misinformation goes a long way and it's also Centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:31:40
This is no true, the blocksize increase is one of Satoshi's final propositions to solve exactly the problem BTC is faced with now...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:49
At this exact moment, BTC does not even work as a currency... It's shitcoin fork does
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:11:16
r/Bitcoin argumentation skills

Nice, you smart fox !

How exactly did you code yourself to Bitcoin ;)

Tell her how much money you have in crypto
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:00:22
I'll pm you mine if you pm me yours ;)
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:01:58
Because of the technology?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:38:50
Only if pasta
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:44:38
Look into kmd, it's the future of decentralization and an innovator in the field, you should find it very interesting
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:56:30
It could never be worse than fiat
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:57:31
If we get there, that means that Bitcoin is no longer just an investment, but an actual currency. People will "cash out" their btc to buy bread, cars, homes from someone who will use it to do the same
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:14:54
You might want to call an ambulance
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:12:01
I'll take your word for it
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:27:14
Ah, the famous strategy of dumping alts at lows for btc and highs, then buying back alts at highs when BTC goes back lower, the true optimisation of trading. Some advice : just hodl if you don't know what you're doing
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:53:15
This should temporarily happen, yes
