Why doesn't it make sense? Does it make less sense than say a bitcoin t-shirt? People put logos and stuff they think are cool on all sorts of things - t-shirts, bags, hats, bumper stickers and what have you.

This great for bitcoin - now all the mainstream media must fully embrace bitcoin just because Trump said is against it! It won't take long until we'll see articles in NYT or WaPo saying you are basically a white supremacist if you don't hold bitcoin.

It is very clunky, both interface and process. Everyone, myself included, really like the idea of Bisq, in principle, and it is being run by enthusiasts, so we have even more good will towards it, but all that means that no one dares call it out for the parts that aren't working or user friendly enough. If you do, people will get butthurt and call you a bank shill. 
I think this attitude of low expectations is what is holding Bisq back. 
Lacking marketing resources like Coinbase, and lacking the support of the mainstream, the very least Bisq can do is look better, work better, just *be better* than the professional services, it *has to*, and at least be on par with them. Right now it just doesn't compare in any category, except privacy. That's too many disadvantages at once.

It's "a Bitcoin bag", if it is a bag whose distinguishing characteristic is that it has the word bitcoin on it, in the same way that a T-shirt with a big bitcoin logo smack in the middle is called "a Bitcoin t-shirt". Title claims the employee is carrying a Bitcoin bag, and IMHO that is exactly what I see in the picture.

Why am I not surprised that a scammy pretend currency such as bcash also runs a scammy pretend web address such as local.bitcoins.com, to trick ppl who think it is localbitcoins.com. Gotta admit these scammers are consistent in their scams at least.

I was tentatively on Bitwala's side in this matter, until I read this laughably bullshit laden rubbish of an answer. Then I read the above "reply" and now my faith in Bitwala is shaken.

BitPay is 100% compromised by all the bad actors possible.

^ Good answer.
Might add that the main problem many had with the SW2X was by setting a very dangerous precedent for the future, in how it meant that a group of unelected big business buddies got together behind closed doors to decide the future of bitcoin, in complete contrast with the existing principle that "code rules". if they had gotten away with SW2X, then there would be a very slippery slope towards this secret group of industry leaders being able to decide in the future. And *that* would be dangerous for two reasons: First, they could favor their own interests, and secondly, and worst: This group would be a critical pressure point where governments and outsiders such as big banks could exert  influence and compromise bitcoin *through* this unofficial "ruling body".
That's what was the main danger. By rejecting SW2X, bitcoin defended itself against government and big bank control.
At least for now... :/

Probably a relic of the days when currency was silver coins (and gold etc, but mostly silver). Tampering with such coins in any way whatsoever would typically be a prelude to trying to scam people with debased value coins.
Also, which might be involved, in some countries it might involve defacing the face of the monarch, and if you think that's a stupid reason, try burning the national flag of any country you are in, and see people get really upset: Defacing the symbol of the nation is usually not taken lightly.

If we reach a high, it is direct evidence of adoption (in the sense that more people are using it, if for nothing else, as an investment tool, at the very least). If you still think bitcoin is about being able to buy coffee in a way that stores your tx on a blockchain, time to wake up from 2014 delusions.

BitPay should be avoided at all costs for other reasons as well, their utter contempt for privacy, their support of bcash and other hostile forks, them being owned by Bitmain, being some.

That would be ridiculous, and equivalent to a de facto bank shutdown. People wouldn't be able to pay rent etc. That's a certain way to trigger a massive financial crash, similar to Cyprus or Greece, except on a 100 times larger scale. They are not going to do that.

You ever wonder how your bank account works, grandpa? You know, your bank keeps track of a number of how much money you have. Bitcoin is the same, except instead of the bank keeping track of how much is on your account, EVERYONE keeps track of it (everyone who uses bitcoin). That way the bank can't cheat, and the government can't come in and nudge the bank to give your  money to them. They would have to convince EVERYONE to let them cheat, and that's just not possible.
Because you don't want everyone to know how much YOU have, people only know that SOMEONE has this and that much money, and only the person who owns it can access it, because he has to use a secret password only he knows.

Signing with Satoshi's keys wouldn't prove anything definitively, sure. However, being *unable* to sign with any of his keys, does prove beyond reasonable doubt that this person is *not* Satoshi.

The April 2013 bubble is the anomaly here. The run up was short and the bubble popped too soon. Previous cycles had been longer, more like the subsequent ones. If you think of April 2013 not as a separate bubble but rather a dress rehearsal for December 2013, or of 2013 as a single bubble with two acts, it makes more sense.

It took 20 years from the creation of DARPAnet until a genius came up with the idea of the www. Then it took, I think 4 or 5 years from the www whitepaper until we had decently functional web browsers up and running. Then another half decade until the dot com bubble fully blossomed. Then it popped and another 5-10 years before social media took off.
LN is on track. Just 10 years since the whitepaper for the underlying protocol was posted (I see bitcoin as equivalent to the underlying internet, as first introduced by DARPAnet, and LN as equivalent to the "www of bitcoin"). Expecting exciting things to start happening with LN around 2025.
