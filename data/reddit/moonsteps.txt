There is no contradiction in what I said and you clearly provided a straw man argument to back up your claim. Twitter is a real social media platform with meaningfully more people of significance than reddit. It supports business activities ridiculously better than reddit. Reddit just has more accounts and probably people, which help to create buzz beyond my direct spheres of influence. It's not about pats on the back, it's about focusing on twitter as a platform that realistically helps to build my business while being aware of the value reddit can add to those efforts.
It's getting increasingly difficult to find good faith in your stance.

That is accurate. Yet, I still engage with the community and users on my posts on reddit, and it's therefore difficult for me to find a meaningful issue here worth removing the post over. If anything, it should be grounds for re-reinstatement of the post.

What's up with the community's data nihilism recently?

Please share where this is defined as spam in the subreddit rules. Content is content, regardless of the source. Don't be foolish Bash.

As long as you paid fees it's valid volume.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:47:00
Transfer volume is in the trillions as well however.

I was unaware of this as a website practice. It's now understandable why every serious media firm and publication in the world treats reddit like a joke.
Think about it Bash, does it make sense to push away content from people that actually care about their personal reputation and brand to embrace people that only care about reddit clout? Because that's who doesn't care about receiving attribution outside of reddit.

As you just mentioned my actions indicate I don't necessarily agree with the view of it being a joke. That doesn't change the fact it's how reddit is broadly viewed by the industries most likely to actually pay for advertising and fund its growth.
There's little to no reason for me or any other serious researcher to post here without attribution to another platform. I run a company Bash, I'm not here for pats on the back by internet strangers.

I said trading fees, which are paid to trading venues, not transfer fees, which are paid to miners. 
I recommend reading up on how all of this works, it's actually fairly interesting stuff!

If they're paying trading fees it's valid volume.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:09:13
Nope. By that day's daily weighted price.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:46:34
This is trading volume, not transfer volume. All of it is off-chain so fees are paid to trading venue not to miners.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:43:00
For sure for sure!

And to think, we're still just getting started.

There has to be a buyer for every seller and a seller for every buyer.

As is the case with every tradeable asset :)
