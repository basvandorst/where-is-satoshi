Why would you think that this has any relevance?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:19:46
We are not focusing on the financial aspect but rather to improve customer experience and reduce operational cost.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:26:38
It's a good suggestion but I'd rather keep the job for now, it's a great company and they care a lot about their employees. All I'm trying to do is to find a way to make insurance more affordable for everyone, the less the company spend on operational costs the better they can offer lower rates. I'm hoping that if I'm able to archive this other insurance companies will follow.

It's nonsense because if I put the printer that I used to print my private keys on the internet nothing will happen. Even if I give the printer to you, you won't be able to get my private keys.

Anything you see about the transaction in your browser is public, the things you cannot show are: your private key, password and recovery seed
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:24:08
I think vanguard and any other traditional investment is riskier than bitcoin. Stocks will go down, it's not a matter of "if" but "when". 
When people realize how bad their stocks perform they will eventually cashout and cash into crypto.
Those low risk investments are usually based on commodities and stock from big legacy companies. There is a big disruption for these markets coming and fast
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:14:46
Yes, as in 2 copies. I keep them in separate addresses in case one place catches on fire
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:27:17
Hahahahaha, this doesn't prove anything, sorry I'm losing time with you, definitely paranoid.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:30:59
That's not correct, you will still fit the same amount of transactions in the block, the difference now is that many transactions will happen offchain or on sidechains by creating lightening channels.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:30:09
If a hacker already infected your computer you are fucked anyway. We are talking about safely store your bitcoin. Hardware wallet is no good if your computer is already infected as the hacker can key log everything you do.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:16:47
Nothing to worry about, if you check the blockchain and the transaction is there you just need to wait

It already makes sense to borrow money to buy bitcoin, I borrowed a year ago, 8x profit, not even interested in paying back so soon even though I got plenty of money to pay off, just not worth it
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:13:18
I didn't say it gets erased quickly, it's like a buffer, like a dash cam, once memory is full it starts overwriting the oldest data. So if you print regularly it will be overwritten quickly. To retrieve this data you would need to have physical access to the printer and the fact that the printer has been previously connected to the network internet is pointless, even if you connect it to the internet after you print your private keys, it's still not possible to access the data and even if you can access the data there are millions of printers connected to the internet. How would a hacker know which printer just printed some private keys?
So yes, it is paranoia!
Nothing is 100% safe, saying that a paper wallet is not safe because someone can hack into the printer is nonsense.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:35:12
That's why XRP is overpriced at the moment, but as soon as people realize that there is no major banks involved and it's not been used by any of its banking partners on a production level... guess what will happen....
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:24:04
Nobody is cutting anything off bitcoin, they are duplicating, there is a very big difference there!
Also I don't think it's a bad thing, it's by design and has a positive impact on bitcoin, it shows how resilient the network is. Bitcoin is open source anyone is allowed to copy it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:43:12
It's HODL for Bitcoin and DUMP for BCH
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:17:54
Only because lots of people entering the space now doesn't understand how bitcoin works, but it won't matter in the future as people will not care about these details, the only thing they will see is their wallets with money and a working network that sends and receives transactions.
Just like with banks, people don't care if money runs on a mainframe or on a laptop, all they care is that they can make transactions and their money doesn't disappear.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:22:46
You will need to contact customer support (coinify). I don't think you can request for verification again until they clear the first request
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:12:34
Don't you understand? A fork is not bitcoin, it's the byproduct of the failed attempt to update bitcoin without consensus. When that happens, the software rejects the the update and if someone keeps mining that rejected update than it's able to stay alive. You give it a name and bingo, you got yourself a brand new altcoin with bitcoin transaction history by default. You can do that before any transaction took place by just copying the source code and modifying what you want, or down the road with a fork, but it will never be bitcoin.
By design you cannot modify bitcoin without consensus, the original chain will always survive and the forked chain will not be bitcoin.
Basically bitcoin cash is just the trash rejected by the network, they can do as many forks as they want and that just makes bitcoin stronger, the more they do it, the less effect will have on bitcoin.

I'm willing to help you, how much are we talking about?
If you want to store wallets in a database it has to be encrypted.

Best online wallet is blockchain.info, you can save your private keys and if their server ever gets hacked or if you lose access to their service you will NOT lose your coins!

That's called "Search Engine Optimization", with a domain name bitcoin.com is not too hard to get in first place, there is no domain name better than that in a SEO point of view.

12 word seed only helps you to recover your keys from a proprietary wallet, if that wallet cease to exist so does your money.
If you are holding for the long run, copy your private keys into a txt file, print it, then destroy the file. When the time comes it will be safe to get your money from the private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:16:21
No, if you buy 1 bitcoin today it's not going to be 2 bitcoins tomorrow, so if you hold your coin you are not making any money
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:38:04
Are you serious? I don't think you understand how cryptography works, do you?
That's the least possible outcome. A government crackdown on exchanges is more likely to be disastrous for the price.
When I say that it was crazy is because prices can go down and I could be stuck with the coins having to pay interest.
Bitcoin encryption in unbreakable in today's world, it would take billions of years for all top 100 computers combined to break the encryption.
I know how safe my coins are, you should too.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:09:42
Sorry, but that's called paranoia! Besides it's a lot easier to retrieve your private keys from those old printers that used a tape to print. Modern printer do have volatile and non-volatile memory, volatile memory gets erased when you turn your printer off (like computer ram). Non-volatile memory is very limited and get overwritten very quickly. Like I said even if I give you my printer you won't be able to extract my private keys, wanna bet?
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:25:01
I think "never" is a very strong word.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:38:29
That's enough, if we divide all 21m bitcoins equally, everyone gets less than 0,003 each. Off course it won't be divided equally so you can expect the average people to have much less.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:53:20
It's not necessarily a correction, investors are cashing out, to investors all that matters is that they bought $10k worth of btc and now they have $15k. That's a profit of 50% on top of their investment. They don't care if next time they reinvest they will only have 80% of btc they originally bought. All they care is next time they sell they will make another 50% on top of their investments again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:28:06
In a 100 years if bitcoin is still here, people will blindly trust it. The coins will be well distributed, dollar will cease to exist and bitcoin will be the base currency. That's when bitcoin value will stabilize but still prices will go down for goods and service because humans are getting better at doing things so that's the natural course.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:29:00
It's not the price of the coin itself that matters but its market cap, and XRP market cap is very pricey for a centralized money transfer service with no customer base.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:21:23
Not necessarily, the demand can decrease and price will still go up if the supply decreases faster or the benefits grows. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:46:23
You got scammed! Don't use bitcoin.com, it belongs to Roger Ver, one of the people behind bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:13:35
Lots of things, supply and demand is the basic rule. 
Supply is fixed: 21 million will ever exist
Demand: Grows as more users join in or in the event same user wants more
Now the questions is: what makes more users to join in?
That's question is answered by asking: what makes bitcoin special?
Answer this and you will know what makes the price go up.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:19:14
The answer is not easy. But as time passes bitcoin gets stronger, trust is built over time. People trust gold because it has value for hundred of years.
The characteristics of bitcoin are similar to gold but better.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:55:01
Blockchain is just a wallet service, not an exchange!
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:12:08
That's the exact thing that I thought before I borrowed the money, very stupid, very stupid, but I did it anyways.
I told a friend earlier this year and he did the same thing. I told him he was crazy because BTC was around $1200 when he borrowed the money, in the end he made a lot of money, repaid his debt and he still have around 50 BTC and 200 ETH. He bought ETH between $30 and $75, also thought he was crazy for buying ETH but it was actually an excellent move.
It's all about luck, but at this moment very likely BTC will give you more return than what it cost in interest to borrow if you live in the US where you can borrow for 10% a year (BTC is up 400% YTD)
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:39:55
Got it, so what you are saying is that regardless how we do it, as long as we have more bytes/second we will have more data to store and thus more centralization. So bigger blocks or faster blocks would have the same effect towards centralization. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:41:34
If you are using blockchain and have your private keys you are good. Just send your bitcoins to a different wallet before loading your old private keys into BCH software and you are good to go.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:01:15
So you are going to run this on your local server instead of a hosting like GoDaddy?

Have you checked if you can recover your private keys using your seed if libbitcoin-explorer goes offline/cease to exist?
If you have you private keys on QR cod you should be fine too.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:22:31
That's nonsense 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:19:21
1 - eventually but not now, doesn't make any sense to do this now and risk centralization
2 - there is no consensus for this change, it was an agreement between a hand full of people behind closed doors. If there is consensus, changes will take place and you will have nothing to worry about
3 - miners will still mine as long as it is profitable to mine, they might be important but not irreplaceable

Annual minimum wage in Brazil is about $3000. But hardly someone will be able to save 1 bitcoin if they make so little

@_date: 2017-08-01 20:23:25
I don't think your answer is accurate... we did NOT increase the block size, but we did change it so we can have segwit activated to increase transaction rate.

Don't use coinbase. One day I logged into my coinbase account and it showed that I was 10 BTC negative, than they tried to withdraw money from my bank account without my consent several times, each time halving the amount to see if they could get some. I had to call my bank and explain the situation because it generated many NSF fees. Stay away from coinbase they don't care for you or anybody else (maybe they care for large traders). Don't trust any exchange and definitely don't leave any coins there!
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:46:27
It depends, do you live in China?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:51:07
Then it's good that you have more time to withdraw (or buy more from the dip) from the exchanges but it's bad that you won't be able to trade after they all close.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:54:41
I would say that we are about in the floor right now, but who knows, hard to predict this shit. Anyways I believe it will hit new highs before end of this year. Good luck!

@_date: 2017-07-20 19:59:16
Not really, I would say that at least 95% agreement can be called a consensus, anything less is just democracy

That's standard in the lightning network, obsolete transactions can be broadcasted and penalty transactions too if a obsolete transaction happens
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:35:09
It's not real
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:42:56
No problem, if you are new to mining I recommend using simplemining if you will be mining on a PC that you don't need to use. If you need windows on your PC then I suggest you use claymore miner because you can dual mine.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:44:45
Why not, as far as I know if you broadcast an obsolete transaction your counterpart can broadcast a penalty transaction and therefore keep your money. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:59:59
Thank you, maybe I just need to study this more.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:45:30
What are you talking about? You first need to buy coins at current prices for coinbase to withdrawal from your account.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:28:26
1070 is better for mining
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:40:43
Thank you for the short answer but I'm was looking for a more elaborated answer. What would prevent my counterpart from doing this?
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:37:17
BCN is Bytecoin not bitcoin. You cannot mine bitcoin with minergate.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:25:19
Money did not double, the chain is the one that doubles. If you had 1 BTC before you still have 1 BTC because you bought it before the split and your transaction is before the split. However you will be able to spend this 1 BTC in both chains because both chains tells the same history (that you have 1 BTC)
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:52:16
No you don't, you can buy bitcoins directly.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:05:18
Maybe you should stop playing with your money on things you don't understand. If you want to invest in crypto, buy bitcoins and hold. This is a long term investment not a get rich quick scheme.

Euro and dollar are different currencies and have different exchange rates
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:50:22
Well for starters you can't make bitcoin out of thin air, the limit is 21m. Nobody is telling you to go buy bitcoin. You can still use your fiat currency until they are worthless. Then you will buy crypto because you will have no other option.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:49:26
Me neither, and honestly I would rather have no changes at all on the network, it was working just fine.

Remind me again what is the benefit of activating 2x besides making Jihan, Roger &amp; Co happy because they can profit more that way?
I don't support 2x and I never signed any agreement. Bitcoin is not made by trust but consensus. If there is no consensus there should no 2x.
If you want money based on trust, buy fiat!
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:21:07
Agreed! Easy to backup too.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:50:26
You don't have to know your counterpart private keys to broadcast a penalty transaction and keep the funds.

I don't think they will be down, maybe you won't be able to deposit or withdraw in bitcoins but if you have coins or $$ there I'm sure you will still be able to trade. Most of exchanges deal with more than just bitcoin anyways.
