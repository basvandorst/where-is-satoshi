The constant thing I am hearing the last 2days is to sell because the bubble is going to Pop. WTF is going on with these people and there advice all of a sudden? I just nod and think to myself that is the last thing I am going to do.

This Entire thing is so Scary,a lot of people are going to be pissed if this thing goes down. The people want to be free and not controlled. it is just sad.I am hoping these exchanges just see that there is room to help people and not kill everyones dream of having control of their money.
I believe if this goes down in this manner certain people will have to fear for their safety. I am not at all suggesting this but it would impossible to believe that this would not lead to some very angry people wanting to express themselves and letting those responsible feel some pain.

I actually do not know what to do or think.
It seems like both chains have a great risk of falling. I just don't know why coinabse and these other exchanges are willing to hurt so many people,especially now because of bitcoin, people are just starting to see a light at the end of this tunnel. Now only to have this freaking Fork coming I am going to have a heart attack. I have some coins offline and on the exchanges as well because I cannot  figure a safe place that is certain. I am angry because this fork is not even needed, and things are growing fast. WHY DO THIS? WHY? WHY? WHY? The frustration makes you want to hurt someone.

I am trying to understand this. If these S2x dudes win 
do we loose all the value in our regular Bitcoins?
