Thank you for the link!  I'm really looking forward to reading your paper.  I do not know what your opinions are, but thank you for teaching this subject to others.  Particularly to many who have no awareness of, or desire to use, DNMs.  The larger the haystack becomes, the more challenging it is to find each of our needles.

I respect your opinions, and I agree with many of them. Thank you for your reply.  
I fully agree that geopolitical and economic events don't automatically cause BTC to fluctuate.  The short term swings are often much more effect than they are cause.  Shitloads of money being traded based upon speculation and subsequent volatility.  
But from a more macro perspective, I do think that economic instability and currency fears can drive a trend in BTC pricing.  BTC is becoming much more widely adopted with more institutional holding.  
It's pretty ironic how BTC fluctuations often coexist with currency fluctuations - this is so counter to the philosophy of many who believe in BTC as a way to store value without being tied to a given state or economy.  
Perhaps BTC is entering early adolescence.  To paraphrase one of my favorite Reddit posters; 'if this were the history of rap music, we are at Sugarhill Gang.'

That's like saying World War II took place in 1945, while dismissing a decade of totalitarian rule in Germany and a bloody multinational war that lasted for years prior to 1945.
As I stated, I'm not an expert on the subject.  But there was a lot happening economically in Greece in 2013, and Cyprus in seems to have been the break in the levy before the flood.
Remind me again about the economic stability of Cyprus, Greece, and the rest of Europe around 2011-2015?  What are your thoughts regarding the cause of the BTC spikes in Spring and Fall 2013?
Correlation doesn't mean causality; I get that.  And, again as a layperson looking at history, I am not an authority.  Can you tell me about the economic stability of Greece in 2015, as well as the years preceding 2015?  I would enjoy learning more about this subject and I'm all ears if you can teach me about economic history, with a focus on Bitcoin and Europe circa 2013-2015.

I love the irony of how the major spike over $1,000 a few years ago was specifically tied to an international government bailout.
I haven't researched it thoroughly, so apologies if my comment is FUD.  I read that the spike had to with the Cypress default and that bitcoin was used, specifically because they had fears about the ways traditional currency works.  That just blows my mind because it illustrates the inherent merit of how/why bitcoin was created.  To have it used in conjunction with a currency crisis seems cringeworthy.  Almost like leaving your wife because she won't sleep with you, then fucking your wife's sister after not  sleeping with your wife for a decade - with your sole ambition being to prove that your dick works.
