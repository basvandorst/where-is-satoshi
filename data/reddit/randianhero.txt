I lost 10+ coins (or 80% of the value I had there). Luckily it was only part of my hodlings. Can't complain since I withdrew 350 coins from there that I bought with €5000 back in 2011, though :)

No, I don't blame the immigrants, I use their services and we have a good time doing business, for example in Ûber rides. If it were for me most of them would be allowed in, given that they would not be paid any benefits, ever (and no-one else should be paid benefits for that matter). I'm just saying it's not as easy as just saying Trump is the bad guy here.
The problem with immigration to a country like the U.S. that initiate violence against its inhabitants to collect taxes must increase the tax collection when immigrants consume more welfare than the previous population, hence decreasing the freedom in the country that receives the immigration.

Good thing for the Trump then that Obama spent 50+ Billion on NSA plus extra secret tools to track every Western Union bit of money then... Bitcoin user still unaffected.
More seriously though. Crook governments make their population dirt poor and benefit tremendously from remittances. This is why countries like Mexico and Turkey encourage their citizen slaves to emigrate illegally to the U.S. and northern Europe. 
The remittances are pretty much throwing good money after bad, supporting a failed state and prolonging change and suffering. I dislike Trump as much as anyone but the real culprit are the leaders of countries like Mexico and Turkey.

This may have been a precursor to Sweden's third largest bank running an full page "sponsored content" ad trying to put Bitcoin in negative light, and ensuring that they don't trade with Bitcoin.

The question is: Why spend money on an article like this?

- If there is something missing that currency need to function effectively as a means of payment, so it's stability, says Johan Javeus, SEB's chief strategist.

The text says it's several million SEK, so up to a million dollar or half a million dollars. Swedish journalists call this high volume.

Do you have an URL or reference to a paper edition?

I think the boss in their marketing department just invested some in secret.

For that reason some people in the marketing apartment of SEB might have invested in some coins in secret.

A "notable" part of bitcoin transactions are also gambling and deep Web.  No address will catch up to the &lt;a href= betting addresses in cheer popularity.

I gave my gf 11 coins back when it was about $200 each.
She gave back 6 so far.

True if we lived in a free market world. As it looks like now, the edge will go to who can get the most energy that someone else pays. IE countries with subsidised power, or where it's easiest to connect to the grid without paying per unit of electricity.
