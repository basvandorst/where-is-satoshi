The fact that the South Korean government is afraid of bitcoin is a great indication that they’re scared of how powerful bitcoin is. That shows you the value of bitcoin, definitely buying more

Long green sticks? Sounds like dolla dolla bills

Credit card but the fee is 4%
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:33:42
Curious makes you think so?
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:17:04
It’s 4% on coinbase. Generate 10% profit and it’s worth it
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:44:29
Hm I figure if I spend 3k at coinbase 4% is $120 in fees, but in return it’s 50,000 miles.

read somewhere that it's considered a commodity, so a good

Just watching the order book off GDAX
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:41:55
Hodl. I thought about selling yesterday but held and the price rose $1000 today
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:42:09
Red are sells buys are green
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:40:45
Let them buy, build the wall!
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:39:09
And how do I tell when I’m in that stage? Haha
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:33:55
Can I ask what exchange you were going through? And how long it took you to pay back your fees and even out?
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:40:18
Wow great to know! Yeah I have the cash to pay off immediately. I figured if I’m already investing this amount of money, why not earn rewards off it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:46:08
Do you mean the coinbase bch insider trading? Still, we’re in an unregulated market here I wouldn’t be surprised
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:02:41
Why do u think ppl are attacking bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:24
BUT IM NOT ENJOYING THIS RIDE
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:51:26
Look at this guys comment history ... trying to drive the price down? No such luck. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:13:11
Yeah but I fear that when I get into alts, everyone will switch back into btc
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:00:01
Uh oh it’s 13.2k you think it will drop harder?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:03:01
It takes five days to clear ACH
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:19:04
I have a pretty decent understanding of the tech, but from an investing stand point, the knifes kinda falling 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:56:26
Fear that the price will drop further. They’d rather jump out now and buy back in at say 10k. Seeing a lot of reddit commenters trying to instill fear to drive the price down 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:27:19
I’m in the same boat in college, I’ve made a 50% return investing a few hundred. Its worth it to buy the dips and average out your cost. If you truly believe in bitcoin you’ll make a nice investment. good luck!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:14:19
At dinner I was excited because I sold out at 19k a while ago, and my dad tries telling me it’s a ponzi scheme and that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. :/ tried explaining the utility and the technology but nope. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:08:58
New here. Only been on coinbase cuz I haven’t able to get approved elsewhere. in order to receive the fork using Coinbase, how much BTC do I need to hold? And where should I move it?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:14:22
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:12:29
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:43:44

@_date: 2017-12-30 13:47:55
I thought this would be fun :/
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:29:11
Pretty sure their id verification has been down for a month, I’ve been trying to get verified for a week with no luck
