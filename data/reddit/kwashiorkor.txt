People have to understand the risks.  These events can serve as hard lessons to some.  We no ling live in an era where we have to trust Time magazine or some government spokesperson to tell us where to place our savings.  It's up to us to educate ourselves, and the information is freely accessible now.  
People need to learn not to trust banks that aren't being audited by independent organizations or that don't have the proper level of insurance.

I think their easiest path is to try to undermine confidence in the system.  If they can keep people from using it out of fear, then they don't have to greatly risk showing the level of their interference.  A few simple hacks against poorly-defended exchanges or banks, setting up (or funding) phoney or scam services, playing up the threat of hackers raising questions about the fundamental soundness of the system, and let the fear multiply.
A good defense from this would be to suppress unfounded rumors and to trace these incidents back to infiltrators and expose them.

Banks are not required for large Bitcoin transactions, or large numbers of small transactions.  With government issued currencies, the banks are guaranteed a cut of the action.
The value of Bitcoins is independent of interest rate adjustments and inflation of currency as a means covering debt.  These are the "external influences" that most concern me.

What kind of missionaries and what kind of leader?  You have to figure out how it's going to help them meet their own goals.  
For the missionaries, it may be an easier or faster way to get donations to them.
For the leader, it may depend on the economic conditions in his country.  If he were to encourage the use of bitcoins either by the government itself or the general public, will enhance his career?  Would it help his country bypass controls instituted by the U.S., the IMF or the World Bank?  Will it somehow bring money into the country?

I think I have far more to fear from the government itself, both in terms of how it wants to protect and promote certain corporations (at their bidding), and how it wants to steal what I have by its redistribution schemes, or prevent me from earning and spending money the way I want to.  I don't fear corporations in an open market -- competition will keep them in check.
But there's nothing to ever keep government in check.  That's why I need anonymity.  Without economic freedom, I don't have many other freedoms.

Some might say that, but I think they've been conned.


No, not at all.  Those types will always be there.  But they won't have the protection of government, like they do today.  They will be punished by the market for their bad choices.


They don't have to be corporations, but businesses will meet the needs demanded by the public.  That's how it's always worked (unless force intervenes).


Whether the motivation is self-sacrifice, greed or just wanting to earn a living, the free market rewards (without discrimination) the ones who are best able to serve the demands of the public.
Whenever you have corporations screwing people over, every time it's the government that made the abuse possible in the first place.

The masses want illegal goods, and they all want to protect their assets -- they've just been afraid of the consequences.  Bitcoin is a market solution that serves this demand.  Once freed from the artificial constraint, they'll come to realize that freedom allows everyone to be better off.  Right now it's the privileged elite who have access to better health services, can get the drugs they want without fear of arrest or impoverishment, can afford private education and security, can move their money around at much greater advantage than the general public (look at Cyprus).
Bitcoin is the leveler: it will break the patent drug monopolies, break the government licensing monopolies that drive up the costs of drugs and other treatments.  Private security could replace the abusive, militarized police forces that are trampling rights in the U.S. and around the world.   Bitcoin could be the revenge of those who have been "worse off" against the ones who have used the force of government to keep them in a "better off" position.
It's that anonymity that's needed by the people in order to break the control structures that they're slaving under.

"You" and your bullshit social contract are the main reason that bitcoin exists: the controls you want to place on those involved in voluntary trades are simply tools for enriching a minority of players, as they have always been.

I think it depends on how broadly you cast the net. Sarah Palin and Romney both claimed to have a lot of libertarian supporters.  Some of the left-types claimed that there were a lot of libertarians in the OWS movement.  But if you go back to the core literature, like Nock and Mencken, you find a desire for very small, limited government, much smaller than that embraced by those would call themselves "libertarian friendly."   And if you look the period of expansive growth of the movement (mostly attributable to Rothbard), you find find a goal of elimination of the state, as is clearly present in his works.  I think that's still a minority within the larger movement, but it is a substantial minority.

For me (and many others I interact with), it comes from the moral position that initiation of force against others is a moral wrong; it's wrong for me to do it to others, so it's also wrong for an agent of mine (say, a government agent) to initiate force in my stead.
Given that moral position, the next question is how society can continue without the institutions that we've all been raised with, and been raised to believe are essential to modern civilization.  Much has been written addressing those issues.  Anarchy doesn't have to mean chaos or the trampling of rights.
That's where the left and right perspectives come in: the left anticipates that people would act justly in the absence of force because they understand that's what's best for society, while the right-libertarian believes that each would find it in their own best economic interests to act justly.  That's not to say that all would act justly in the absence of government controls, just that those who did cause harm would wither find themselves ostracized by society or at severe economic disadvantage.
I used to be one of the small-government types, then I became convinced of the moral issue, but still doubted the practicality.  But having read a lot of the theoretical stuff, I'm convinced now that it could work.
And I'm seeing it happening here: the Internet and now Bitcoins are outsmarting governments.  It's not force and control that will win, but reason and the market.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:09:15
Yes, I can.  Government currently holds a monopoly on those services, so there's no real reason for them to make them better or more efficient.  I want to be able to choose who provides those services to me so that I will be able to control the costs vs. benefits.  Right now it's one-size-fits-all, and there's no competition that will drive down costs or improve the service.

My guess is that if you asked (80k+ subscribers), you'd get 60-70% Republican voters, and 20-30% Libertarian Party voters.  But if you asked /anarcho_capitalism (10K+ subscribers), you'd have 70-80% opposed to voting entirely.  Rothbard himself was heavily involved in the party at one point, but later became disillusioned.  I think most of those core libertarians see the party as just a means to an end -- they'd vote for a Libertarian candidate if they thought he could win, and if he was truly committed to moving us toward an eventual dismantling of government.
@_date: 2013-09-26 17:21:46
It's a bad response because our constitution is supposed to protect our right from the tyranny of even a majority of the public, especially with regard to engaging in private contracts, such as trading in bitcoin.
