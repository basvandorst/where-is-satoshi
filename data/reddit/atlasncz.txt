Because these things are cool, instead of just looking cool

Yeah, people who buy drugs, do money loundry, buy illegal stuff do a lot for bitcoin. But who cares who does more for bitcoin? I'm not into drugs and I'm not into illegal stuff, Buying products with bitcoin that you can easily buy with cash does nothing for bitcoin, because that's not what It is for. Holding bitcoin does more for the coin than buying a hotdog with a 80% loss
Edit: Bitcoin is a store of value and a way to have control over your own money. It's not for buying hotdogs

Me too. Just be prepared to lose everything, I already did once. Don't believe It is impossible. Take profits and have some in fiat too
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:12:08
the Bitgrail "hack". Yeah, I was pretty dumb to let all my money in a shit exchange
@_date: 2018-11-29 12:38:01
Fuck BCH!

Banks are a part of the government
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:55:07
Incredible how they still have so much volume, people are really ignorant.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:53:30
I already lost all the money I had once, Im not gonna let some dump beat me down
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:43:09
&lt; Buy some now and have some to buy later 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:59:52
Yes we are
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:39:39
Hodling means ignoring short term volatility
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:21:43
then they will have billions of dollars after getting out
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:45:08
The day I trade my bitcoin It will be in exchange for a lambo
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:49:28
HODLers don't just HODL, We buy more and also take profits
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:45:02
Of course the right thing to do is not to HODL, the right thing to do is to have supernatural powers and know exactly what the market is going to do next. But not everybody is like You, that's why the best option for us humans Is to HODL :)

So you never visit yout mother? That's sad
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:47:54
If by fun you mean wasting your time doing worthless work instead of just doing nothing and getting in the same place. Yeah, much more fun!
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:57:04
That's is a hell of a healthy addiction lol

lifetime wealth
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:31:31
Pretty cool
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:57:50
Thats why they will buy when bitcoin is at peak and lose everything once again while we holders accumulate for life changing wealth 
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:17:27
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:18:05
Still holding

Scarcity is one of the things that are required for something to be a good coin, being a good coin Is what produces demand, and demand gives value.  
We are not trying to prove that Bitcoin has value because It has scarcity, We are trying to prove that It has value because It has all the qualities a coin needs to have that other currencies don't have

Linux Is faster, more secure and overall better than windows but windows Is still alive anyway. Some people just have different taste
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:21:00
Because It's basically another form of taxation, wich is theft
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:11:39
It still endangers your life
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:44:53
I like more buying opportunities
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:34:18
Because holding It yourself Is totally unpractical  
Edit: It doesn't only diminishes the safety of your money but also of your life  
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:05:01
How does this keep your account secure? They think people are dumb...
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:33:11

Crypto is here to change things, not to be the same as FIAT. If bitcoin turns into another regulated coin I'll just look for other options
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:40:44
Not boring for me, It's great to buy bitcoin at low prices. I've been buying every month now since september
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:33:04
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:49:55
Bitcoin Is already the best in value and security. Lightning network Is making It competitive in terms of speed and fees. Bitcoin being also private would make It officially the best crypto in the market
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:26:58
I remember when the internet was the one to blame
