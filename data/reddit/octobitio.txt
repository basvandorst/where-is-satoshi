It's pretty stunning if true. It is equivalent to roughly 10% of the US population

The ground is just as pissed as Roger Ver

Which is why I say equivalent
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:59:31
Is it strictly for German citizens or EU?
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:34:18
I got this idea from the Freakonomics sequel "Think like a freak". Fuck with them. Play dumb and make them believe you're going to send them bitcoin, but make it extremely painful. Ask for guidance along every step as if they were talking to you great grand mother. And then share with us, just for fun!
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:35:05
Oddly, I actually find it motivational
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:45
Look at it in terms of %. Think about it as $15.5 &amp; $16.9. Still... 9%

It could be a good analogy. Imagine a minesweeper game with billions of squares and money instead of mines. Your best bet is to click randomly until you find a prize.

Interesting how accurate it fits. But your equation is linear, I don't think this is a nonlinear model

I'm pretty sure that's the case. But hey, $100 * 856,000 = $85.6 M

Yeah I would rather say "...rises more than 1 billion"

I meant redundant because the guy unnecessarily rephrases the whole formula a hundred times instead of taking the first result and multiplying it

Beware of the "club" many of these are pyramid schemes using the name of bitcoin and the currency as the mechanism. I found one in a rural town in Mexico .

You wish she asked for it. If she knows what bitcoin is it's cause you can't stop talking about it.

I hope it's a (bad) joke. This is so badly translated. I doubt they would call it "*la* bitcoin". Also " tout le moon" means nothing.

Covering the destination address isn't a safety measure at all when you have the specific amount down to the satoshis and the date...

Exactly. Just some highschool kid probably.

Try not to mention price and don't describe it as an investment, describe it as a technology (think of e-mail). This is the best way I've found to make people more receptive
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:09:32
Leaving the discussion apart, if you are so convinced Bitcoin is useless why do you spend your precious time and energy here? I'm truly curious.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:03:14
The purpose is good, but practically, it's a horrible idea. I'm not worried about stressing the network, stressing the exchanges is what feels prone to chaos.
