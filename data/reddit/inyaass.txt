Yes. You send them the BIP38 encrypted private key. Only you know the password to the key. Problem solved.

I tried to get it as well. I was told that since I already had a second account I was ineligible. 
Why do I have two accounts? Because I previously opened an account with my student email to redeem the $10 promotion but was ineligible for THAT because I already had my first account. Let down 2 out of 2 times. 
Can't wait to get my invite from Circle…

I think it's VERY important that we don't find out who he/she/they is/are.  Satoshi created something that will lead to a massive revolution against those in power - the banks and governments. 
Obviously, only bad things can come from outing him and it would be a shame to lose such a great mind because we want to put a face and a name to the code.
On the topic of him suddenly dumping all his coins onto the market, I just call that a sale on Bitcoin. If the price suddenly drops to $1 it's not like the math becomes unusable… There will still be widespread adoption and if I can buy 1000 coins at $1 each you can bet your ass I (and most others) will jump on that REAL quick.

Change the bits to dollars and satoshis to cents. Make sense now? 
There's no reason to keep thinking in terms of whole bitcoins once we switch to bits (I'm assuming the 0.00015000 bitcoin was the confusing part).

I don't know why people can't just provide actual help in the subreddit...
From what I understand this can be used to tie together different addresses to a single entity. I'm not sure what they would do with that information but that's all the advice I can give. There are numerous threads on the 1Enjoy and 1Sochi dust transactions that have been going around. If it's from one of those addresses just search for one of those threads. 
I just got a text from blockchain.info telling me that I received a similar payment. I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:48:47
I'm sorry, but how is this legal?
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:55:17
Does 'non denominated' mean no funds are in the address that the coin corresponds to?

Are you seriously worried about your money at a time like this? I know this sounds dramatic but this man's life could very well be at stake now.
I'm not all for getting out the pitchforks and torches but something needs to happen. Were the pictures of his car and house THAT important? Couldn't she have just described his modest lifestyle, you know, with words? 
The man could have a slip of paper under his mattress worth hundreds of millions of dollars… People get murdered daily for much less. But let's publish all this information about his personal life and get on our way, right? Just so long as it desn't hurt *MY* investment.

I hate all these gender-related bitcoin posts. Also, women can use the dollar and the afghani just as easily as men… I'm pretty sure there's never been a gender-specific currency.

I would hold onto it until she turns 18 (birthday surprise). I'll probably get down voted for telling you to withhold the gift but I know when I was a preteen I would spend money on ridiculous shit. Plus the value may be significantly higher then making it a bitchin' birthday present.

He's right, OP. Those images under media are art!
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:52:00
If you're really in it for the long haul this time (which I'm assuming you are based on past experience) then now is the best time to buy. Short-term it probably will go down some. Long-term It will most likely go up. Just buy in and hold. It's just my opinion but I feel like that's the best strategy.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:07:03
I think he's talking about the security of the network. More hashing power = greater security. More computational power is going toward mining bitcoin therefore the Bitcoin protocol is more secure than any other altcoin protocol. Please correct me if I'm mistaken.

Coinbase as previously mentioned. I believe only the first transaction takes a few days. After the first transaction clears through your bank you're able to instantly purchase a little bit per day (I think like 0.2 BTC max). I've made upwards of 10 instant transactions, mostly small &lt;0.2 BTC transactions and after about 5 of those my max instant buy limit was increased to 10 BTC per day. 
It really is a great and easy to use website.

After watching the video about remittances to Uganda, I can't wait for bitcoin to go mainstream and really start helping people (instead of being just some kind of speculative circlejerky asset).
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:14:01
tl;dr Because more bitcoins were bought than sold.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:50:50
I know with all the media coverage it seems like you can make a fortune by buying bitcoins but that doesn't mean you should just throw money at someone and hope for a 1000% return. 
Please read up before you invest in anything. Make sure you know what you're getting into and WHY you're getting into it. If it's because someone from CNBC told you to buy then you need to rethink what you're doing. 
Now if you're still interested:
You should have a public address on coinbase. You give them cash and they transfer the bitcoin to your address. You should check on  and wait for a couple confirmations on the transaction before you part ways with the seller. I'm sure they'll explain all of this to you but definitely don't let them leave without at least one confirmation on the transaction.
Please learn more about bitcoin before putting any more money in.
The first thing you should look at is how to properly store your coins (I know it's small but if you put in more money you need to think about keeping them securely offline).
