Where can i store my bitcoin....?  ������  USA vault British Vault ������ 
oh yea, it all fits in my jump drive!  
 Buy and hodl!
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:24:33
What?  Hahahahah sounds like a loop!   Don't use bitcoin to buy a lambo but instead use the unsold bitcoin to buy more bitcoin???  Trippy!   Hahahahah  or we can all just HODL!
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:35:24
Nice!  Great to see someone stuck to their word!  One day when bitcoin is in the millions,  this will go down in history as one expensive "find bitcoin" puzzle in history and your name will go down in history.   
Great work!
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:34:34
Tether has NOTHING to do with bitcoin at all.  People keep getting that wrong!  Tether is pegged to USD and they print or burn it to keep it at a constant USD value.   Do your research and findout for yourself.

Yes, use bitcoin as USA government can't sanction it.  Iran has many miners and the crytpocurrencies is an answer to many of USA governements unjust policies against your country.

I am buying at $9000!!   You losers can say what you want but its natural for everything to come down sometimes including stocks.   It's a buying opportunity!!!   Bitcoin has gone up 3 million percent since it eary days.  It will go up soon after it's correction.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:28:42
Bimex is not the only exchange. Their are many others exchanges in different contries...  US governement found out that they can't stop Bitcoin in anyform which is why they stopped trying after years of trying.  
Now many exchanges have opened up here in USA.  Also, USA only represents around 15% of the crypto markets so its not too big of a loss even if they somehow were able to prevent all of us here...
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:29:13
Good!  I would do the same!   If i had "crippling" sanctions on me illegally, i would use every volt of electricity that i make using my large reserves of oil into mining.  It's inly common sense!

I have a question:   why is your country allowing this Gaydo guy run free when he is running around causing problems and trying to get foreign countries to bomb your country?  Isn't that treason?
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:02:39
I would say keep 90% bitcoin and 10% altcoins.   In the altcoins, i would only stick to XRP, ETH, and LTC.    Just keep in mind that bitcoin is the boss, until that goes up, no altcoins will gain.  
As of now, if you are Hodl-ing, just stick to it while everything bottoms out and dont be discouraged if everything goes down for afew more weeks while it goes through it's NORMAL correction.  We will see another parabolic move upwards soon after the correction.  
I am preparing myself for round 3 of purchases as soon as bitcoin hits around $8400.   Always HODL!
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:25:54
It's temporary!  It will shoot back up once it hits around $8K.  This will be the last time we see bitcoin under $10K USD.

Buddy i did my research and your claim doesn't hold up.  Even if what you say is true that tether was trying to manipulate bitcoin prices, it's still impossible.  Afew hundreds of million dollars is not much when it comes to bitcoin market cap of over 200 billion dollars.  Like i said, tether is just USD pegged crypto thats used to facilitate transactions of crypto buys and sales.   Tether keeps getting minted and burned constantly.  
Think of it logically, people have alot of trust in bitcoin and willing to pay higher prices to get out of fiats!    If bitcoin prices comes anywhere near $7000, people like myself will invest heavly into it. The price will shoot back up quickly!  Check out bitcoin tractions, bitcoin is being purchased by thousands of whales and millions of people around the world nonstop and we have a limited supply!  Prices will catch up!  
If you still have doubts, then you should invest in facebooks Libra!  That might be a better fit for you!

@_date: 2019-07-18 23:51:39
Do you even understand how money works?  Obviously not!   Let me teach you some economics 101:  what he is saying is an increase in minimum wage will have a upward pressure on US dollars nflation rate (meaning the dollar will accelerate in the loss of it's true value).  Bitcoin is deflationary! so if you buy more bitcoin now, you will have more money to spend later on.   Buy bitcoin and HODL

Sorry but terrorist use of cryptos is almost non-existent according to several researchers.  Terrorists usually operate from a war torn country with little infrastructure.  Crypto is much harder for them to use in transactions then say USD or another fiat currency.   
Also, if countries stop funding terriorist, we wouldnt have any!  Look at the Saudi's funding isis, or USA and UK giving weapons to the FSA which in turn gave it all to ISIS.  Or even Obama destroying Libya and making it a hot-bed for terrorists including ISIS.  The root cause of terrorism is not with crypto at all!

Buddy let me stop you right there when it comes to Iran! 
I am not Iranian but i can say that they are right 100% in their dispute with us here in America.  They destroyed ISIS from syria and they stuck with the nuclear deal. Remember it was idiot Trump left.  Now we have illegal sanctions on them making things way worse. Its only logical for them to bypasses these illegal sanctions by using crypto. I would put every watt into making bitcoin if i had "crippling sanctions" on me, i think everyone would.  On top of all that, it's washington that keep pressuring other countries to perform evil acts on them including taking their oil tankers.  
If you want peace and are American, vote in next elections and lets get a real president in place and not some reality TV actor.
As mentioned, crypto and bitcoin are the future and unstoppable.

Alot of people will blindly say "Hodl" (hold)  but you have to be smart about it.  Bitcoin will keep going up overtime but you want to maximize your profits and catch it while it's at it's lowest.   Their are indicators that show bitcoin is on its way down due certain  significant levels and certain gaps on-top of other indicators.  Just wait alittle longer!

I have dealt with large and upcoming companies before.  You will be amazed how much they will pay for somethings they want.  Coinbase has alot of money and growing quickly.  Keep that in mind.  Good luck!

Did he say $15k dollars or 15k yuan or someother cheap currency?

I max BOUGHT myself when it was $8k, HODL!!!
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:22:41
Exactly!  Check this out:
March 2010.  Bitcoin was .003 cents
At todays $10k: thats over 3 million % increase
Todays bitcoin at $10k
To $100 million:  thats only 9,999 % increase
So it is way easier to get to $100 million per bitcoin than it was to come up from .003 cent to $10k.

No!  Absolutely not!   We will head to $13-$14k in next two week.  Too much up pressure.

Why do you want to fund radical groups?     Imagine if some foreigners stated funding radical groups here in the states who are causing problems for the rest of us.  That would suck!       Not nice!  
You should use the money to help African countries where people are dieing every single minute from starvation.

Electron flow will stop and you would lose the current which will stop all functions.  But before that can happen, the chips will crumble into pieces as the different materials starts cooling and contracting at different temperatures.

Your right!

Why do you guys post these fake stuff?     Free watch with a ridiculous shipping cost?

Hahahah, you idiot!   I only support peace and calm, thats all.  
What i am against is afew people stirring up trouble for the greater population!   like in hong kong!  or that gaydo guy in Venezuela who says he is the president when he didn't even run for office.  
If you think these are legitimate movements, you are retarded to the point that nothing can be done for you.    And if you are so passionate about these radical movements, why don't you go join them?  Why aren't you in Venezuela fighting for gaydo?  He can't get this own people to fight his fight and now wants foreigners to come fight it.  So you should go!    If you want hong kong, then go there and help them!  Why are you a little bitch talking smack from the comfort of your own home.  Go fight or shut your mouth and allow peace, you troll.
And one more thing:      if idiots like you tried stirring up trouble here in my state of california, i would be the first person to confront you!   No way i would allow idiots like you to take us back to the stone age!   I wouldn't just sit around and allow you to take away what i have work so hard for!
