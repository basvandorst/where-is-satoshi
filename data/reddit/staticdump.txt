They are not doing business with US based customers anymore. I opened an account this morning and discovered this. They probably don’t want to deal with our licensing process. Users already based in the US cannot deposit funds and I guess they are going to start closing accounts.

Hello I posted a link in the main thread with some details. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:39:25
I bought a few moments ago at 6950. Not sure if it’ll go much lower but if it does, HODL. Watch what happens after they rise from bed on the other side of the globe.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:51:24
I’m guessing there should be a decimal point at the beginning mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:54
So, who else is jumping for joy right now?

Hey I posted some details in the main thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:20:58
Possibly. Buying little bits of Alts and Forks and HODLing helps counter this. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:47:38
At risk of being banned again (this time it would be sale of goods) I've put this details on a Facebook page I made. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:49:03
Misinformation. A lot of people right now are fudding bitcoin since they won’t bank off SegWit2x. Since this is no longer happening, the forked coin hopefuls are pumping BCH, spreading fake news about BCH taking over as the primary Bitcoin. Also, Bitcoin Classic is closing down, and some were led to believe it was Bitcoin that is closing down making way for Bitcoin Cash. Beware, Bitcoin Cash is being pumped right now, and will inevitably be dumped. 
Do not expect this dip to last long. You should know the drill by now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:49:35
They are just trading in Alts right now, ETN is becoming hot and XMR is bullish. They’ll come back.

Do it, I have 0 photo editing skill lol. I’ve been wanting to post this for weeks but they finally lifted my ban.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:16:17
I am because I want the forked coins from my private keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:21:21
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:30
I won.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:21:51
Well, you’ll recover the funds using your private key in a BTG wallet, and then just transfer to another BTG wallet that has a different set of private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:51:34
Think so, just submit it and find out. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:37:23
At $100 my guess is you intend to HODL. Buy on Coinbase, then transfer to another wallet that is safe and secure. Paper wallets engraved onto metal are best for long term ��
$100 is not enough to really active trade with, with a paper wallet you can still keep adding to it with the public key and unable to spend. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:40:50
No real face value? You have no idea what Bitcoin is. Fiat is going to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:44:29
I feel very sad for these people right now. Especially anyone going over to BCH. Its going to get dumped right back into BTC. I tried to warn them... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:48:58
It’s just a pump and dump. Nothing new, nothing special. Bitcoin Cash is garbage. Someone is making immense profits on this fud right now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:50:34
And as expected 2 in 3 of my generation are doomed.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:31:49
Well, they didn't. I have not see one spec of confirmation from Chinese authorities. If someone has seen irrefutable proof, please reply here. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:17:00
Smelted a 1 ounce gold coin in two halves and engraved the wallet address on the outside and the private key inside. Sealed with more gold. In the future I would love to laser engrave a QR code wallet address on the other side.
This way I can't spend the funds but can still fluff up my wallet without having to destroy the coin. 
Also my Bitcoins will have some sort of physical value as well. It's my shiny.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:44
More of a deep gash. It's already healing, and I expect a major run when the Chinese hop back onboard in about a month. WATCH
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:09:51
I intend to submit pics on a new thread soon! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:31:43

If you are in it for the long term haul. Do it. Bitcoin is here to stay. You will are correct, you will not see short term ROI mining anymore. I would go all out in that case, get a new Asus bitcoin mining board and stack it with 1070s. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:11:48
You mean, like Venezuela who is no longer using USD for trading? I can see them moving to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:32:11
We'll be back at $4200 by Sunday, just watch. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:33:10
It will be $22k in December. Just HODL
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:19:44
It's probably not. You forget new exchanges are opening up everywhere, I think a physical Exchange was opened up recently on South Korea, these guys are gonna suck up huge volumes while the price is low.

@_date: 2017-09-15 08:35:51
Dude just wait it out, it does this all the time. You are going to BANK next year. Probably December. 
Take your Bitcoins out of the exchange, put into a wallet, write down the recovery key and lock it away. Forget about it, you made a good investment. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:33:10

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:47:09
Wish I waited longer. Bought .5 when it dropped to 4200 the first time. Still HODLing my first .24. 
Write about Bitcoin, promote it to your friends/family. Every little bit helps. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:28:03
Not sure what you mean by inflation.
This  happens all the time with China. If you did not panic sell you did not lose anything. We are already making up the market cap by normal growth and those Chinese users whose funds were automatically refunded from the exchanges are buying private again, more when their wire transfers clear. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:48:33
No. I didn't think about it until I got active on Reddit because of the recent bitcoin dip. I'm going to do more with Litecoin using junk silver soon, will document. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:42:18
Nope. No sir. Buy low.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:53:54
FAAAKE. BTCC is refunding an ICO
NEXT! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:44:48
Yes. It’s going to drop. And then it’s going back up. Check the price every day instead of minute/hour- it helps with your nerves. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:03:19
Fuck no. 
Buy more.

The point is at $5500/$6k - its gonna dip, don't wait for $7k, $10k, it won't happen- expect the dip. Buy the dip. Embrace it.
Lots of people think this and then buy half-way at the dip and fuck themselves. I've observed it a few times now. Poor dudes :(

Yeah, don't look to WSJ for news on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a threat to Wall Street, it would be anything but non biased.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:42:18
Nope. No sir. Buy low.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:35:20
Lol for sure. Well it's sealed inside (like two wafers pressed into one) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:13:15
Good point. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:27:21
Yeah- the USD is fucked. 
HODL bitcoin. It's a failsafe more than anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:38:30
I'm fine without China's influence and if it could stay lower for a little while, great! But I really do think they will be coming back in droves next week through private buys. Also anticipating new players from other regions. Next week could be HUGE.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:15:07
My money is on BTC like a good little HODLer.

Nope. You don't understand Bitcoin then. Go watch some YouTube tutorials.

Good going. It'll be worth $75 before you know it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:49:25
I have firm belief JPM is buying but not to invest. That's not sinister enough. I think they could dump their entire volume when the stash gets big enough and try to create another downward trend.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:22:14
Nope. Not even close. Bitcoin is never going away. NEVERRRRRRRRR

Ok so I'm wrooong. But a lot could happen in one day, no? :D
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:07:31

Guess I was off a few days? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:23:47
Here, because why reinvent the wheel?
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:21:47
Why? Just buy more coins. Anyone that says Bitcoin is in a crash simply doesn't understand the technology fully. 1 BTC still equals 1 BTC. I use to go through the same thing watching the US dollar constantly plummet and rise on the currency exchanges. Still HODLing CNY ;D
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:02:38
Who would have thought? On Reddit of all places lol
