Could this lead to bitcoin faction banking / IOU?
(Everything depends on not demanding real payment or keeping the payment channels open for a long time so that the payments will cancel each other out.)

The graph in the link shows 30% adoption in 2k blocks, although segwit.co shows a 19.2% adoption in 2016 blocks. Can someone eli5 why there is a discrepancy between the two?

Ah! thank you, didn't have my coffee yet ;)

Where can i find some information about the "FeeFilter"? Or can someone Eli5 on the topic ?

Will it improve ? The chain will grow overtime and my worries will be that the next time it will be worse....

ty for the eli5.   
Will have to research the difference between sidechains and LN ;)

Ok i'm especially interested in the case of multiple "LN" implementations. 
How (technically) would a transfer of bitcoin from one "LN" to another "LN" flow (Note. i'm referencing to different LN style implementations)

Ok, but if it goes though BTC and the BTC is used as settlement layer the penalty to cross chains would be, somewhat high (the BTC transaction costs would be quite high). 
Would this mean that relative small transactions (coffee size) can't be done between chains (or do i have an error in my thinking).
