You're in love with a 'currency' that is slow, has high fees and 200k+ unconfirmed transactions that increases or decreases 50%+ in one day?

20k-25k at this rate by EOY is a walk in the park. 100k by end of 2018 also a guarantee. What the fuck is happening.

But exchanges can? At least with a bank they're accountable to governments and potentially millions of shareholders.

Wait why are you cashing out into filthy fiat?

Says the increasingly nervous bagholder. How does it feeling know that at any moment a years worth of gains can evaporate? Nice currency you got there.. oh sorry I meant 'store of value' it's worthless as a currency.

This is not going to happen. When the price per bitcoin reaches huge numbers like $10k+ per coin, the average person is going to see it as too expensive of an investment to make and will think it's overvalued and will not put their money in. The rate of growth will start to slow down and stagnant soon which will cause sell offs.

Buying BTC through an ATM is too expensive due to the fees, you'd be better offer just buying through Coinbase. Otherwise you're just putting money into the ATM owner's pockets.

Of course. It's the very definition of a speculative bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:03:28
Not really. Fiat is inflationary so people tend to use it because it loses value over time. It rewards people who spend  it. Bitcoin is the opposite, it rewards people who hoard it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:02:14
No it's not, because even if you assume the LN network is working why would anybody say buy a Starbucks coffee or groceries with Bitcoin knowing that tomorrow his BTC will be up 1%? Bitcoin because it's deflationary rewards hoarding or hodling.

Lol this is not going to end up well for you

Is that why you value Bitcoin in terms of its price in US Dollars? Is that why most people are holding so one day they cash out in fiat and buy their lambos? You people are a delusional cult at this point. If bitcoin is a 'store of value' why even shit on the US dollar? Both can co-exist by that definition.

Yup bitcoin is just a massive speculative bubble waiting to explode. Nobody is using it for its intended purpose (decentralized p2p internet money) because of how expensive and slow it is, now these cultists are going around claiming we're stupid because we want to use bitcoin for its original intended purpose instead of muh store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:55:34
Why would you spend bitcoin knowing it's going to up in price?
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:03:51
In other words Bitcoin Cash is trash..
