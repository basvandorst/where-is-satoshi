Are you familiar with the origin of the $ symbol? Originally it denoted Spanish dollars and adopted by the USA when they announced boldly that they created a better peso. Keep in mind this is when Spain owned a shit load of gold after ransacking the Americas.
They inflated their monetary supply causing the price of gold to go through the floor, so the US created a new money that could only be purchased with gold as the note was transferable and the supply of US Dollars $ was vastly lower than the amount of gold in free circulation at the time.
Hard money was created in this manor as the number of holders were a niche group and the creation of new dollars hinged on converting gold for dollars. People could adopt the USD but only if they believed that America would succeed. Sound familiar?
There is no doubt in my mind that the $ symbol could be easily adopted by Bitcoin and making it similar to the @ symbol makes the most sense in the modern digital era.
