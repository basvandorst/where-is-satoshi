But now you can dump shitcoins faster than ever.

I agree with you, although I would like to remark that it's curious there is a guy who tries his absolute best to live in anonymity (the person interviewed in the article) carries the same name as the guy behind bitcoin. 
Unless the whole story is completely made up, of course.

I didn't know Chris Crocker was a bitcoin enthusiast, we have a celebrity here people!

I'm not sure. Speaking as an employer, when someone leaves, he's gone, unless he has a really, really good excuse. Otherwise you risk creating a culture of people just leaving your company to see if the grass really is greener on the other side, and expect it to be risk-free.

This indeed sounds really reasonable and has a good chance of actually being true, instead of all the other overly cynical/conspiracy theorists. 
I *would* want to move offices in cases like these. If they didn't come up with it themselves, people around them must've adviced them to do so.

I have quite a few millennial friends who work in legal, government and financial institutions who do not use facebook (or if they do, under a fictional name) and would in no way participate in these kind of polls.

How would Bitcoin solve the problem that taxpayers have to cover the risks of banks that are "too big to fail" ?

OP wasn't serious, right ?

Exactly, it is used as a replacement for understanding. "Have faith" is used exactly in the circumstances where someone doesn't understand something. 
So the last thing that a (rational) investor should do is "have faith".

It depends whether it is something that can be explained. Trying to understand whether Bitcoin is a bubble or not, for example, borders on a religious discussion rather than a scientific discussion.

What would be the impact of increasing the block size on all the ASIC chips?

How could you not do that before? The performance of something is in percentages up/down, I don't see how this changes anything.

This is exactly it. I was recently shopping on eBay for a new MacBook, and saw some deals that looked too good to be true. However, since payments occurred via eBay/PayPal, my reasoning was simple: there was no way they [the seller] would be screwing me over, since I'm pretty much guaranteed to get my money back on that occasion. 
Thus, I am the person with the money, I have the power, and a seller using paypal is telling me he's a legit seller.

This is simply not true, there are many, many secure java applications out there.

Keep in mind that those are different people saying those things. It's the voters of this community that quickly change their opinion, which is understandably an emotional reaction.
