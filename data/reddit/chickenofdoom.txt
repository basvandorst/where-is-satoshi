That just isn't true. Pyramid schemes require new investors because that is where the money to pay dividends on the old investments comes from. Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends, it's a strictly buy low/sell high kind of thing. For this reason the value of Bitcoin does not have the same kind of linear relationship with the amount of new speculative investments.
If you want to accuse the majority of Bitcoin investors with overhyping it so they can sell as soon as the price inflates, it would be more appropriate to compare it to a pump and dump scam than a pyramid scheme.

The energy efficiency of technology has no influence on how much energy is used.

Realistically, no one knows what bitcoin will be valued at even if it achieves ultra widespread adoption. To speculate though, I believe the lower limit depends on the value bitcoin needs to have to support the transaction volume people want to use it for.
In the US, people spend around 3 billion dollars a day on credit cards. To make a lazy approximation and assume global credit card spending correlates exactly with gdp, credit cards need to transfer 13 billion dollars a day.
If Bitcoin were to supplant the credit card industry, what would the lower limit on its value be? Assuming that people mainly use it for transactions, and immediately put it back on the market for anyone else wanting to use it, for every time it's used to pay for something, lets say it takes on average 15 minutes for the cycle of transactions to process and make the coins available for use again. If the global volume is 13 billion dollars a day, the 15 minute volume would be 135 million dollars. So for the network to function, the total value of all bitcoins in active circulation would need to be at least 135 million dollars.
The number of bitcoins probably in active circulation right now is around 300k. 135 million / 300k = 450.
Of course I'm making tons of assumptions here and there could be tons of reasons why the price could end up completely different. Just keep in mind that even if it completely takes over as a payment processing service, that does not guarantee a crazy high value.

How would the existence of private money put a limit on how much power a single entity can have? It might decrease the power of banks themselves, but it doesn't remove the profit incentive of doing business with bad actors, and surely someone would be able to fill that role.

But there are ways for the government to directly, legally prohibit processing payments for particular entities. Has a payment processor ever gotten in legal trouble for processing payments to someone where there was no explicit prohibition? I'm kind of skeptical about that.


Regardless of government intervention, I think payment processing services naturally gravitate towards a monopoly situation. Supporting additional services is a significant burden on retailers, and by choosing the one with the largest userbase they maximize their chances that any given customer can pay while keeping things simple. From a consumer perspective it's the same; how many companies support a processor is the biggest factor in which one is practical for them to adopt. There's a very strong feedback loop here where the biggest companies have a huge advantage without any need for protectionism.

The intrinsic value of bitcoin is in its utility. With bitcoins, you can easily do certain things that would be difficult otherwise, such as get money in a different currency, move money across international borders, or bypass the arbitrary restrictions and risks of traditional payment processors. It's a service disguised as a commodity.
The natural price is a function of how much computing power it takes to serve the demand for transactions, and the expense of that power. This can theoretically scale down pretty far; if the price of bitcoins goes down to the point where miners stop getting enough money to cover the cost of electricity, some miners will shut down and the rest will get a bigger proportion of the rewards. There's forces driving the price in the other direction too though; transaction fees can be optionally included (and distributed to the miners) to make your transaction have a higher priority. The more service degrades, the more people will have to use these, creating both a higher incentive to mine and a disincentive to conduct frequent transactions. With a greater incentive to hold on to bitcoins and conduct transactions in bulk, the number of coins available at any given moment is reduced. Since people need to buy and sell them in order to use the service, the supply goes down and fails to meet demand, people pay more, and the end result of all this is an increased price.
The real value of a bitcoin balances around the demand for transactions and the cost of electricity. The more people using bitcoins, the higher the price has to be.
I haven't done the math on this so I couldn't say if this applies lately, but historically speculators have not been aware of or cared about this, so the actual price doesn't follow it at all.
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:59:47
It's ridiculous because if you operate an online business like a VPN service, paypal is practically mandatory. I guarantee you that by doing this, they will succeed in meaningfully reducing the number of people able to figure out how to purchase a VPN.
This is honestly the main reason I like Bitcoin. Payment processors have a near monopoly, and they use that monopoly to control the behavior of huge numbers of people who have no alternative. Often they cite legal issues, but like in this case, these issues have not yet been subject to our laws. Paypal is using their monopoly power to act like an extralegal police force.

Despite the growing popularity of Bitcoin, it does not yet represent a commercially viable alternative to traditional monetary infrastructure. For most things, if you tell customers or potential donors that you will only accept payments in bitcoins because you don't like the behavior of paypal and credit card companies, you will find yourself losing out on most of the money you otherwise would have made. Despite benefiting from bitcoin donations, Wikileaks remains in dire financial straits and only brings in a fraction of what they did before the blockade. For most people, the barrier of entry to making bitcoin payments is just too high.


These two things are often not mutually compatible. Like it or not, there are private organizations that have very real and significant power over vast numbers of people, and we all suffer if they are allowed to use this power for evil. Sometimes it isn't really possible to take that power away just by making different purchasing decisions as an individual.

Of course. If your sense of morality somehow leads you to believe that I should have done that, then absolutely you have the right to fault me for whatever you want. It's just an opinion, and you're just saying I did the wrong thing, not even that I should have been forcibly prevented from making that mistake.
Compelling someone to do something, on the other hand, is a very big deal, because you are actually forcing someone to act the way you want. There are many cases where someone does the wrong thing, but no one has any right to stop them.

No one wins until interest has abated and people are no longer restarting the timer. No one can assure that they will win. The optimal strategy would be to invest as little as possible for a chance of winning, which means investing nothing until interest is minimal- which is indicated by the timer actually getting very low.
At that point, I see it devolving into a battle of competing bots being run 24/7, which would continue until all but one bot developer loses all hope and decide to cut their losses, or the security of the site fails.

There is no practical value in 'owning' bitcoins, and you can rent them for almost nothing regardless of the exchange rate.
If the price of bitcoins, combined with the volume of transactions, became so low that people have to wait their turn to use them, the price would go back up to just above that level. That would be a floor. But that floor is extremely low, because for it to be reached, all available bitcoins would have to change hands every few minutes. I'm sure that bitcoins could fall well below a dollar in value before that happens. 4$ is not the 'real users' floor.

Regardless of government intervention the insurance industry will continue to drive up the price of medical care (if individuals don't have to worry about the price of individual procedures, the free market has no influence, regardless of how involved the government is).  Help 'voluntarily provided' obviously isn't available to everyone, and you WILL have more people dying of things they could have been easily treated for. Statistically, we (I'm assuming you're in the US) are already very close to the worst western nation in terms of overall health and things like infant mortality and age expectancy, and this is BECAUSE of our reliance on private industry. Doctors have an incentive to choose the most expensive treatment rather than the most effective one for people who can afford it, and many people don't receive any kind of preventative medicine because they can't afford it, creating far more expensive conditions that put more burden on the system. If we came to rely totally on private industry for our health care with zero government intervention, it stands to reason that it would get worse, not better.
Increased productivity would not improve our standard of living. We already have a massive surplus in productivity that is utterly wasted on inane, pointless bullshit like fancy cars, ipads, resturaunts, clothing, production and distribution of physical media, etc. that does not do anything to improve our real standard of living. Hell, we still have all that, PLUS a high unemployment rate. Unemployment meaning people who want a job but can't find one, not lazy bums. If we have more than sufficient resources to help everyone that is sick or injured, but are not doing so, even more resources aren't going to help. This applies to anything involving getting people the things they really need, like housing.

"Where would that someone else get the in-game currency? I guess they could earn it in-game, but I don't think this would be a problem. If you earned 100BTC in the game, you could cash all that out to yourself, which is easier than giving it to someone else."
Why would someone cash out 220$ worth of game money when they can sell it for more than twice that? If people are actually willing to buy in-game money at a 1/4 exchange rate, then they would be even more willing to buy it at a 1/2 exchange rate illicitly. In Eve Online, for instance, there are official means of purchasing in-game money, but RMT still exists; all it has to do is offer a better deal.
"I think it is important that a skilled, but under funded player can beat someone that has more funds, and thus profit. As long as the game is engineered to have upward and downward mobility, this will work out."
You have described a zero-sum game. If the main draw of the game is winning (making a profit), and if the players are acting as economically rational entities, it's a self defeating system. The lifeblood of the game would be net loss players, and the risk is that these players would quickly realize that it is not in their best interests to continue playing.
I feel that, regardless of how you do it, the most important factor in the success of your idea (as with any ftp game) is convincing them otherwise. The two immediately obvious ways of doing this are deceiving them about their prospects (how gambling works) or providing perceived value of in-game resources independent of their potential for profit (how modern ftp games work). The latter would be hindered by marketing the game mostly to people interested in making money from it, because they would be less open to the idea of inherent or experiential value.

I've been predicting that it's just going to keep going down for months now. 
Supply and demand doesn't really apply here. Bitcoins are not consumable, there is no inherent value in holding on to them; their only value is in holding on to them for the brief period necessary to conduct a trade. This allows them to be shared, an attribute intensified by their divisibility. Every bitcoin bought for these purposes is nearly completely balanced out by the same bitcoin sold a few minutes or days later.
For people actually using them as intended, the exchange rate doesn't matter so long as they can obtain X USD worth of bitcoins conveniently and for the same fees. They don't exert pressure on the market.
As far as I can tell, speculators and the creation rate are the only factors that have any real influence on the price of bitcoins. There are people out there with massive hoards of bitcoins looking to unload them as profitably as possible and a shortage of new speculators gullible enough to ignore this fact. The only really confusing thing is why the collapse in value is happening so slowly.

Increases in productivity just produces more of the stuff we are already producing. Who is getting this surplus capital? What makes you believe they will use it to invest in medical research and paying their employees better? Why do their employees need to be paid better?
Even if it did those things, it doesn't matter, because high productivity, as a goal, is **inherently evil**. Wealth represents the time and effort of other human beings. If you have wealth, you have more control over the lives of other people. The more wealth that exists in a society, the more control someone has over everyone else, and the less control anyone has over the structure and content of their own lives. How they live becomes a choice between all the things other people would rather not do for themselves.
In some cases this is ok. People need certain things, and the way our world works it is impossible for them to get them for themselves. But when you take the members of a society and compel them to work endlessly for things you only consider worth having because the time of the makers is worth less than yours, that society is enslaved. A truly free society would be able to direct the majority of its efforts towards individual goals independent of money. If you don't need to be paid for what you are doing, you can do pretty much anything, and that doesn't exclude the things you could be paid for. The path to a country free of tyranny is lower productivity.
This is why I like bitcoin. As an inherently deflationary currency (at least in the long run) it discourages spending, and therefore discourages productivity and encourages economic contraction.

Here's a problem with your plan: if there's a significant penalty for transferring money into the game, whats to stop someone from buying in-game currency from someone else? I guess if you didn't allow players to exchange items or currency within the game at all it could work, otherwise you have a problem.
Here's another, more fundamental problem: Competitive games of skill have a tendency to deteriorate as a core group of skilled players forms. The worst players always lose, become frustrated and quit. The next worse group of players no longer has anyone they can beat, so the same thing happens to them. This continues until only a core group of extremely skilled players remains. 
This effect would be especially magnified by the betting, real world money aspect, because someone who is worse than everyone will see pretty quickly that it doesn't make sense to spend more money. You would pretty quickly get into a situation where there's only a few hackers and pros fighting over a rapidly dwindling supply of bitcoins.
This is why competitive gambling games (that a lot of people play) always have an element of chance. The losers fall into psychological traps and are made to believe that they aren't actually losers, and that the times they won due to pure luck can be replicated. These people fund the rest of the hierarchy.
The hardest and probably most important part about what you would need to do is getting some people to spend more money than they earn, because if your game doesn't do that, its bitcoins will drain away. If you want to do this without gambling, you might want to look into the strategies utilized by the growing trend of 'free to play' games. This ( is a good article on the subject, but it would make sense to read about what fps and mmo examples of the revenue model do as well.
Edit: I don't mean to say it couldn't work; this is a really interesting idea, because there have been very few games where it's actually allowed for you to earn money you can take out of the game. The only ones I know of are Second Life, Entropia Online, and the yet to be released Diablo 3.

State, to me, means any codified organization of people. So if there's a small community, and that community decides to collectively do something about the guy that's been stealing everybody's potatoes and throwing them at beavers, then you have a state (the community) taxing its members (requiring help driving off or punishing the potato thief) in order to preserve the legal infrastructure that allows people to own potatoes.
You can't get around the fact that it takes effort and considerable investment to maintain the systems allowing property to exist. Property owners therefore collectively owe a debt to the people that supplied that labor.

I expect that there are very few pure anarchists who think a world with no governing structure whatsoever is a good, achievable, maintainable idea. The whole concept of crypto is itself a governing structure over property, just a decentralized, somewhat democratic one.
The value of UBI is that it takes the existing structure of welfare systems and makes it more decentralized. The government is no longer deciding who should be entitled to benefits. It's no longer deciding what exactly people need. It's no longer perversely manipulating people away from their ambitions by creating a situation where a person will gain nothing or actually decrease their net income by aspiring to more. The unconditional nature of UBI, the way it helps people find their own path out of poverty instead of ignorantly prescribing one, means less government control exerted over individuals.
Of course this, as with any welfare program, isn't compatible with the right-libertarian concept of freedom and property (because it is redistributive and must be funded with taxes). But I think there is a very strong case that a UBI would distribute power rather than centralizing it, and therefore, as I see it, increase freedom overall.

Since most people using bitcoins just want to instantly convert them across to a different currency to make purchases, they only really need to have them for a few hours or minutes. They can be shared between everyone making transactions. To fulfill this bandwidth requirement, the value of a bitcoin would have to be such that the monetary value of transactions happening in the span of a few hours is equal to the combined value of all the circulating bitcoins. 
Lets say that there end up being 5 million bitcoins available to transactions. If every few hours a billion dollars change hands, to meet the transactional demand each bitcoin would need to be worth $200. For comparison, Paypal only conducts on average 100 million dollars worth of transactions every few hours.
If the ultimate main driving force of bitcoin value is the utility of bitcoin for conducting transactions, the estimates in this chart are 60 times higher than they should be.
@_date: 2013-10-09 06:43:31


I would be tempted to ONLY accept bitcoin from that day forward.
While that's an admirable position to take, it's an ideological one. Until bitcoin achieves enough ubiquity, it's not going to usually be a good business decision to accept it at the exclusion of other payment processing options, because you are guaranteed to lose a lot of business from the people who have never heard of it. Most companies are going to make these decisions based on what will bring them the most money.
While bitcoin has the potential to undermine the power banks have, it hasn't done it yet, and stuff like this poses a legitimate threat to its continued adoption.
@_date: 2013-03-10 23:10:26
It might be a little less convenient to do it that way, but there's also little reason not to.
Right now, the barrier to that kind of use of bitcoin is volatility. This strikes me as sort of a paradoxical relationship; the increased use of bitcoin as liquid currency would lower the available number of coins and increase its required value to meet transactional demand, but the usefulness of using it that way depends on it being extremely stable so you can guarantee your ability to make payments.
It is possible that it will be used this way in the future, and that would certainly raise prices a lot. But it isn't inevitable. I believe that the volume of transactions will be the central arbiter here, because more powerful transactions are bitcoin's main advantage over other currencies. The proportion of bitcoins that will be available for that purpose is still up in the air.
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:48:11
Why would you need a full month supply of bitcoins? Couldn't you just purchase them as needed on a daily basis? A lack of bitcoins doesn't imply a lack of liquidity.
While I don't see a specific pressure that would result in a certain amount of bitcoins being available to the market, isn't the current proportion that are regularly traded in the ballpark of 20%? 10 million bitcoins out there, 1-2 million traded daily, regardless of how many change hands multiple times. Though I guess daily isn't the same as every few hours. Still, I was assuming 6 hours, and that would only make my numbers off by a factor of 8 or so.

I'm just thinking about the recent events regarding lavabit. If they want to, the US government can use the law to force you to either voluntarily break the anonymity features of your service or shut it down, so where you host your site has a big impact on the extent to which you can guarantee the security of user data.

Still fundamentally different. If you own something it should mean that you control what happens to the thing itself, not just that you have wealth equivalent to the market value of that thing.

Well yeah, but that's about the need for cash, not bitcoins. If you want to make all your payments in bitcoins, you can still do that as long as you have another form of currency on hand. It's possible that bitcoins will replace other currencies as a medium of cash storage, and if so it would completely usurp the transactional value in terms of setting the price, but I don't see any pressures that would cause this to happen. Right now the main value of bitcoins is in their ability to transfer wealth without restrictions.

I don't think this is likely. Financial incentives have been shown to have limited usefulness in encouraging performance, at least in fields that require creativity and intelligence. Money is just a supplement and an organizational tool; people have an inborn drive to do fulfilling, meaningful work.

To be fair, online survey votes are notoriously biased and unreliable. A while back some people from 4chan were able to game the Time magazine most influential person vote precisely enough to get the first letters of the top ten or so candidate names to spell out something offensive.
It would be nice if they adopted bitcoin, but you can't blame a company for deciding not to make major decisions on the basis of those votes.

But if you were able to break open the machine, couldn't you also steal all the bitcoins by just putting the cash through it repeatedly?

The difference is that when you get out of prison, you will still have your bitcoins. If your house gets emminent domain'd you're not getting it back.

Will this service have connections to the United States or have servers hosted there?

Of course, this solution only works if everyone else does the opposite. Otherwise you won't be able to buy or sell very much.

Yes, this is what I've been doing. A limited licence to use something is a poor definition of single person ownership because the real ownership is in fact partially shared with the rest of society. I never advocated a society based around pure ownership and I'm largely against the idea of it, but people should stop pretending we already have one.

Maybe because it puts them at risk of being robbed

The major difference between those two things is that one is an expected part of how the financial system works, and the other is massively disruptive to the system itself, changing expectations of trust and preventing businesses and individuals from doing things they thought they would be able to.
The cyprus thing is like having your car stolen, taxes are like being blackmailed for moderate, consistent amounts of money over a long period of time.
