Careful with this, people.
OP: New account, first posted "How many of you even have 1 BTC". This could be ignorance, but it could just as easily be a new attempt at "normalizing" posting your balances to find potential victims.
Please, if you have bitcoin and you're posting about it, take extreme care to not give any information whatsoever that can identify you. Not even which country you live in. Absolutely no pictures. It's easier to find people than you think.
If bitcoin does go to $1M, how would you feel about criminals looking through these archives?

Ok, let's agree to disagree on the frequency of crime issue.
Now, for the purpose of discussion I will for my next argument assume you're right and the frequency of crime will not increase. I would argue that the increased consequence for an individual of falling victim to a crime necessitates some safety mechanism. When we assess risk, we consider both the probability and the severity of events.
In other words, even if the probability of getting robbed stays the same, I'd want to have some safeguards once crypto becomes mainstream and common knowledge.

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:01:48
This is simply not true.
If you use a paper wallet, you have to enter your seed or your key into a system at some point when you want to do something with your coins. This system that you use at that point in the future when you want to move your coins, is much more likely to be compromised than a hardware wallet.

Won't bitcoins deflation stop once this adoption phase is over and it stabilises?
Also, we already have stores of value with expected growth where people invest their savings. This doesn't seem to stop people from spending, too? Put it like this, if I could have all my funds in my stock portfolio at all times and feed my payment card directly from that, then that's what I'd do.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:58:46
You could just note the BTC amount.
If you want to separate it though, the ledger contains many addresses. Have your friend use just one of the addresses in your ledger and make sure you don't use that one to avoid confusion. He could send to it as many times as he likes in case he wants to add more, and check its status with any blockchain explorer on the web.
Please make sure your device is safely backed up, you wouldn't want to screw up and potentially ruin a friendship.

Generally very sound advice. It depends on a lot of factors though. What percentage is invested, personal finances, responsibilities, risk tolerance, etc. etc. It will vary for each person.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:13:59
True, I always say this but nobody listens :) People keep looking at the market cap when they're trying to evaluate where bitcoin is at, what stage it's at right now, while volume and price is much more relevant.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:49:40
We already have places we can put money and expect growth. Like the stock market. This hasn't traditionally stopped people from spending and just living life.
There's absolutely no reason to believe bitcoin will change that, once the adoption phase is over and it stabilises a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:46:09
Okay, this may be true to some degree, but I still believe the potential reward is a huge incentive.
Let's consider another scenario: Refugees.
I've heard people make the point that "what if you live in a conflict zone and/or have to flee your country for whatever reason, and you could rely on your cryptocurrency waiting for you online once you reach your destination". Sounds good, right? But do we really think that it's without risk crossing borders with these guys that specialize in smuggling people across for money, if you're carrying your crypto keys with you? What happens once everyone you deal with along the way learn about this? I've talked to many refugees through a project a friend of mine worked on. Sometimes they arrive with a few personal belongings, maybe they got to keep their wedding rings, but never cash. More often than not, they got stripped of everything somewhere along the way (Depends on the region. This has been the case with the recent migration wave from Syria).
Does this help you see that this is an actual problem? Maybe not for you, and not now. But for many it is, and for many more it will be in the future.

But I have also seen what substance abuse and addiction can do to a person, and that's just brutal and something else entirely. While my brief brushes with addiction probably don't enable me to imagine what it feels like for the patient, I do know it's a terrible feeling of helplessness to watch it happen to a loved one despite your efforts to help.

You don't need the hardware to access your coins that was placed in a hardware wallet. It's protected by 24 secret words that you can secure in any way you see fit.

Is this entirely true though? Here's my take:
If we we're searching blindly and randomly, it would be, but it's a finite search, after all, and we can exclude what we have already calculated.
If you are the only miner, even if it would take you a long time to find a block, it's more profitable than having say 1% of the total hash power, because your chance of finding the solution increases as you discard what you have already tried. You can't discard a lot in a competitive situation because others are likely to find the block first and you have to start over.
The difference is minuscule for a small player, but increases as your percentage of the total hashrate increases.
Please correct me if I'm wrong! I'm not a miner, or any kind of expert, just a bystander applying logic.

Aren't you missing that he said *per attempt,* here? I.e. the same probability per hash checked.
I'm also pretty sure, taking this new knowledge in consideration, that since the number of solutions is practically infinite, and the difficulty simply means the number of solutions per possible hash (or the number of possible hashes per solution, if you will), it really is mathematically insignificant what everybody else is doing, before it affects difficulty.

I could outline how proof-of-work works, but there are excellent videos out there that explain this probably a lot better. I'm not sure how much you already understand of the technology, so it's hard to know which would suit you best, but here's one I think is a pretty good take on explaining: 
The attack you outline is known as a 51% attack. 16 million USD in bitcoin is created every day and rewarded to miners, plus transaction fees. This serves as a huge incentive to invest in hardware, and as a result it's extremely costly to try to beat the network by controlling 51% or more of the computing power. If you managed to do this, you still couldn't technically do a lot of harm to bitcoin. You will effectively have spent billions on an attack to create a fork of the attacked chain, where you may now rule supreme over a worthless coin. Congratulations. This is because nothing stops the other 49% from just keep mining the other, honest chain (Miners would rapidly notice that the chain is fraudulent and therefore worthless, and promptly start mining where the money is). More on this from stackexchange: 
Systems outside of the attacked chain are ironically the most vulnerable to this kind of attack, since there will be some delay before everyone gets the memo, during which the attacker would try to convert as much as possible of the coin under his control into other assets. I imagine it would be very hard to turn a profit, even harder to get away with it, and if you had resources like this you'd look somewhere else. For political reasons? Not sure, Bitcoin could take a temporary credibility hit, but it would only emerge stronger since everyone would see the true resilience of bitcoins consensus algorithm, and how its true power ultimately lies in human incentives and human consensus, not mere hash power.
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:24:56
I think the key ingredient to understanding how competition changes your chances, is realizing that your chance, per hash, of finding a block increases as you discard possibilities.
If the above weren't true, the chance per hash of finding a block would be constant, and it wouldn't matter, mathematically, if somebody found a block, since you just keep searching for the next one, etc. Your hashrate and the difficulty would be the only factors, and the competition would be irrelevant. Seems like some other people in this thread are thinking this way.
I posted some other answers in this same thread that may also be relevant.

@_date: 2017-11-25 17:38:04
Yeah, with bitcoin you know the person has the means to move all that money in a minute, and after that it's yours and can stay completely anonymously at some address, for as long as you like, until you're ready to move it through whatever you need to clean it up in a matter of minutes. That's a pretty significant difference compared to a bank account or stock holdings.

I saw an "open letter to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash miners from another miner" posted somewhere, outlining an attack on BTC today by raising difficulty as much as possible at the next adjustment, and then moving all hash power over to BCH, to choke the BTC blockchain. I guess someone got the idea of spamming the chain with transactions, and pumping money into BCH as well.
Should we be worried? How much hash power does BTC have and what would it take to stop the spamming? I get the idea that the people behind this attack are willing to risk a lot of funds per block just to keep spamming a somewhat weakened BTC and pumping BCH at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:53:46
Well I certainly don't. It's too hard to understand what's going on here and what the incentives are without being in the know, and in order to be, I get a feeling that you need 1)deep knowledge of programming and blockchain tech, and 2)to have followed this sickening chaos for at least a couple of years.

Insurance would solve the problem, but only on a personal level and not as a society, in that it wouldn't stop the criminals from getting away with your coins. Crimes would probably be rampant, and that would also make the insurances prohibitively expensive.

"2 halves of a piece of paper " … Well yes, but in the end, you need to be able to get your funds, right? Your kidnapper/tormentor will make sure you do everything in your power to get the funds, and he will have you convinced that he doesn't believe your stories and if he doesn't see BTC on his address you will be dead, or left in some remote cabin while he goes after your family. You will believe him, torture will do that to you.
You can get a multisig wallet, but it's just one layer more, maybe you'd have to make a phone call or send a message, but that doesn't mean you're safe.
You can lock your funds up in a smart contract. But then they're locked up, and you can't access them until some point in the future. That's very inconvenient, and it also doesn't save you from being stuck in a hole in the ground for a year or two because the kidnapper decided to wait it out.
The big security problem with crypto is that it's easy to clean up via something like monero, and that it's much easier to get than cash. This makes it extremely vulnerable once you think outside of the technical realm. It's a kidnappers dream.
The only solution I can think of is insurance. But do they even sell that kind of insurance yet? I'm guessing it will be pretty expensive before the companies know how to assess the risks properly.
Also, be smart. Just lay low. Don't do like the OP. Don't even enter your amounts into portfolio trackers or other sites, take off a zero or three.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:29:13
If I look at the bitcoin price and the historical hashrate, I see a different story. Right now, it seems like mining should be profitable for small players, since one year ago the bitcoin price was less than 1/10 of todays price, while at the same time hashrate was at 1/5 of todays. Even without adjusting numbers for more efficient hardware that has entered the market, that should mean profit margins right now are good.

"It wouldn't be economical because in most environments inhabited by humans heat pumps are more efficient than electrical heating by very large factors, so you'd be paying extra for using electrical heat over a proper, efficient, low-energy-usage heat pump."
Heat pumps are about twice as effective. So living in a cold climate more or less halves the cost of electricity for mining. Not great, but it does make it a little more attractive than in hot climates.
Maybe I'm underestimating how harsh competition is in this market? For example, right now bitcoin just had a meteoric rise, is enough new hardware in place already to make profit margins too tight for small players?
Edit: I took a look at historical price and hashrate, and concluded that at least right now it's very likely that profit margins are pretty good until hardware acquisition catches up.

No. You would be entering seeds or keys on your computers keyboard, possibly also showing them on screen. For most users this is not an acceptable risk!

Miners colluding to leave BTC in a mess by increasing difficulty and then moving hashpower to BCH. Also a coordinated attack, at the same time moving huge sums of coins to manipulate the market.

Still leaves you able to move all your funds with no safeguards. Criminals will find out how this works soon enough.
Edit: I may have replied too quickly. Not sure how these work, or what you had in mind. If you're implying that these custodial models will have the same safeguards that banks do and you have to show up in person to move the money, then it may actually be very useful as one of several measures.
I think that as crypto becomes more commonplace the convenience of being able to make unlimited transactions on the blockchain can not safely exist while transactions are still anonymous. One of the two must be sacrificed, and I'm definitely leaning towards scrapping anonymity.

Thanks for your reply.
Maybe you're right, but I'm sure you can appreciate that the avalanche of information is not easy to make sense of for newcomers trying to educate themselves on bitcoin and crypto in general.
I'm not going to get into it, but there are allegations on both sides that warrant further investigation when you come into this with zero knowledge beforehand. I'll hold both BTC and BCH. Getting to the bottom of this, if it's even possible, would cost me only slightly less time than my BCH is worth, and I've reached the conclusion that I prefer my day job to researching this immature mess. I'll wait it out.
It really is a shame. It's a beautiful idea that will probably change history one way or another, and any developer lucky enough to be a part of it should consider him/herself privileged and treat the community with respect.

Actually, the difficulty is more or less mathematically insignificant in this calculation. All we need to know when is that roughly the same amount of BTC will be generated each day and distributed to the total hashpower.
Other than this nitpicking, you're right of course: If bitcoin stops skyrocketing like this, and it probably will have to, then hashpower will catch up and we'll be at breakeven again.
And to be fair, if you believe btc will keep going up there's an easier way to profit from that. So basically, you're right - I hadn't thought this over enough. It's not a no-brainer. I still think it's a feasible idea, but it's not without risk. If I had still lived in the north I'd give it a go though, sounds like something fun to try.

I'm waiting a little longer. I wouldn't mind missing it as much as I'd mind it falling a lot further.
Discount, huh :) Thanks, that calmed that desperate, frothing, gutted animal that's been splattering its blood all over the walls in the back of my head.
First time I see so much red in a 24-hour period in my life as a trader … I traded crude oil for years and used to just relying on trends and cutting losses as soon as the expected pattern breaks. This is a different game altogether, but I have read up on blockchain over the last 6 months and I'm ready to leave the old world behind. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:49:06
Consider this: 
This happened. BTC now has lost like 40% hash power while BCH increased sevenfold. They are more or less 50/50 in hashpower atm, but BTC is struggling with high difficulty and fewer miners combined with spam transactions.
This is a coordinated attack, not market dynamics. It's a shame people can't work together, and that something so important as this has turned into a shitshow.

We can't. Crypto is chaos, we're just guessing blindly like everybody else. All we know is this thing is a supernova, baby! Throw money at it and hope it won't blackhole you.

I seem to remember they were quite positive about ethereum in their Q1 report this year:

How is your tech going to save you with a gun to your head?

It's a lot harder to get away with $10M in fiat than with bitcoin. Also, with bitcoin you know the person has the means to move the coins, some way or other, and will do so under severe threats. $10M in a bank account just aren't accessible to a criminal in any way.

Well, I haven't bought BTC in a while. I'm just holding it.
Maybe another viable strategy could be hunting for alts, especially overlooked news in the midst of all the bitcoin hype. Research is so much work though, compared to just buying what's hot :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:49
I feel like at this point bitcoin has so much traction that it's more likely bitcoin will adapt and successfully scale, than everyone moving to something else. It seems most likely, just to me.
I hold more than just BTC though, the crypto-leg of my portfolio, which is about 25% of my savings, is 1/3 BTC now, with investments in ETH, LTC, IOTA, XMR among others. I'd say it's a good idea to stay updated on what's going on in the space, as long as you stay level-headed, and don't start trying to daytrade this crazy market. If you don't have time for that, you could also check out just a few of the top coins, buy that and forget about it for a few years. Sure has worked well for people in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:01:17
It was not an error. The manipulators who have been pumping BCH are setting buy orders above market. Essentially giving away money to drive up the price.
Congratulations on the trade, risky stuff, but well done.

It's funny how you can spew stuff like this and claim that I'm the one without financial education :)

This is something I thought of, and it will probably be implemented not in a wallet (too easy to get around) but on the blockchain via smart contracts.
However, it's not enough. A kidnapper could keep you in a remote location and move your coins day after day once you've given him the key. With fiat you just can't do that because of banks security.
Also with fiat you have these limits as safeguards, but you can still do transactions that are traceable for much larger amounts at your convenience.
We just have to admit, it's very convenient to have a society that will support and defend ownership of our property. I think crypto also needs that to reach the masses. But this time around, we have to get it right and make sure it's technically impossible for corruption (which makes our current system flawed) to infest the blockchain as it has the fiat money. In my view this is where blockchain can make a difference in the world. It's tamper-proof, and the rules that govern it cannot be changed without consensus.

I too think this. This is too big, no way it's just Roger Ver and his merry gang.

You reduce risk by selling. Buying into mining is not without risk. Bitcoin could crash, and that means some miners have to be squeezed out (kind of like what OPEC was trying to do with shale, come to think of it). Or they could scrap or change the proof-of-work algorithm, something that has been discussed lately.
If you had new tech though, that would give you an edge in the market, I also see no reason to sell. Like if you had the first ASICs you would be sitting on a goldmine of epic proportions, everyone would have to mine at a loss to compete with you, and they'd lose out in the end as you scale up. I guess they sold the first ASICs because they knew several were in development with competitors anyway, and/or they didn't like risk.

The point is just to use all the heat from the miners towards heating the house and the water, so nothing is wasted and the cost of running miners is reduced. That doesn't mean it must be a standalone solution.
Maybe you'd need to heat the water from ~40C to 50C or so as it flows, but that's not hard to do, after all there are insta-heaters that do this with cold water. Also if you're doing water you need to cycle the same water into radiators for heating, because you're not going to stop the mining when nobody's using hot water, right? After all, we have a hardware cost to break even on.

I second this. If this is real (which I don't believe it is), the advice here is bullshit. DON'T take the hard drive out of the laptop, the stress may cause problems or worsen problems it might already have. Boot from something external and make an image of that drive. Read up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:34:27
I second getting a hardware wallet. It's the only way to stay secure unless you're very well versed in security already, in which case you wouldn't be asking these questions.
Do some research, get a hard wallet, and please be *thorough* when you set yourself up. Read some guides online. Think about how you'll store your recovery seed, etc.
Above all, don't forget that YOU still have access to all these funds that can be irreversibly transferred in a few minutes, and that is very much a security issue. It's not something a lot of people talk about, but when everybody and their mother have bitcoins, criminals will get the memo and we'll see people getting coinsnatched. So I guess I'm saying keep that in mind, look for safe solutions and don't go telling people how much you invest.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:22:44
Thanks for your reply.
Looking at the BTC blocks from today, I get 4.6 blocks per hour.
I agree that it's probably not sustainable, admittedly based on rough estimates and my limited understanding of the dynamics (I'm not a programmer or a bitcoin expert).
Even so, what if this keeps up for, say a week? What are possible courses of action for the BTC supporters?
On another note, I can't believe this toxic shit is going on, this will just ruin bitcoins public image once again. It's an ingenious, beautiful concept and devs should be proud to be part of making history, treating their work and the community with a sense of revere. Instead we have greed, propaganda and trolling. To such an extent that it's hard for someone who is new to bitcoin to understand what is going on. I think it's such a shame.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:14:32
You may be right, that sounds logical. Do you have a lot of experience with recovery? Can we at least agree that it's probably best not to take the million-dollar hard drive out of the laptop, but rather just boot it from an external drive?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:16:13
  is a good place to start.
I also follow some of the subs here on reddit, and twitter. But be warned, there is a lot of noise.
Just nosing around at  is another favourite. Make sure you research things thoroughly, unfortunately there are many scams.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:16
That, or just a different PoW. A new, ingenious idea that prevents centralizing.
BTW, what's with this crazy volume? I never thought they could pull this off, the risk is too extreme unless you know you can do it. Some huge player is backing this. Is it the Chinese government making a power grab?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:40:41
The seed can be used as many times as you like. It's fed into an algorithm that generates a bunch of private keys, same result every time.

This x1000. This is what we need to compete!
What's wrong with this idea? Warm up your home and hot water for free, no – while making money. The idea should be so easy to sell, and we should fill the entire northern hemisphere with these and make bitcoin more decentralized and more environment friendly!
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:08:44
Based on a cursory glance at the volumes, probably insignificant. If we assume that the BCH volume on CMC is legit, and as much as 50% of it is from people thinking they're buying Bitcoin (both assumptions are ridiculous), it would be somewhat concerning, though still less than 5%.
In reality, some of the BCH volume is likely fake, and most of the remainder is almost certainly speculators who know the asset well.
