Where I live, the lowest allowable income is around 1.200€/month (after taxes) for a fulltime job. If you live from 700€/month (because you want to spend 150€/month on luxury items) that comes out to a saving of 500€/month. I think you can pay that 300€ deductible from that. If you invest this into traditional stocks at a low rate of 6% (average is 7-8%) you have 81.000€ (without investing at 0% interest you get 60.000 still). From that money you pay the deposit for an appartement. Now you live practically rent free (200€/month for repairs, etc.) and within another 10 years you will have paid that appartement in full. Maybe you won't have the Lambo life but you can atleast give your kids what they need. Thats that thing called responsibility.

In my student time I survived on 550€/month (was abt 5 yrs ago). While paying for Gas, rent, food, internet and all my university stuff. Everyone saying that's not possible is wasting money. Cut alcohol, eating outside, cigarettes and stupid contracts for mobile phones.
Set some money aside each month, invest it and you will be wealthy in no time.
But of course you can also complain with a bottle of beer in one hand sitting infront of your TV.
