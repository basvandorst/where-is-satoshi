I really think LN will help lots of big companies come to the BTC economy. 
I can see dozens of fin tech/CC/Banking corporations, etc. Having a meeting with a bitcoin expert: super interested in bitcoin waxing how cool its and what not. Then they ask "so how many transactions per second can you handle" The expert says "7" the ceo says he need "7000". 
Even if they REALLY REALLY love bitcoin, its scale cannot support them. 
This is an obvious roadblock for companies like paypal or amazon. If they accepted bitcoin tomorrow it would completely crash the network. 
But once we solve that 7 TPS question, we might see some bigger companies hop onboard.

I belive it will replace fiat. 
I agree with what you are saying, but you are looking at it from the perspective of a central banker or university profesor form up top of an ivory tower. 
If you look at it bottom up from the perspective of an individual there is no reason to hold fiat, why would you want to hold inflationary currencies. i dont really care about you GDP goal targets and what not. 
I also dont really agree with the spending part, you only hoard it from two points of view. 
A) if the Rate of return is lower than investing in other stuff, so lets say bitcoin has achived widespread adoption and we no longer see 500% increase per year. we should start seeing a growth that is correlated to the value created per year and act more like a global index, so lets say 4% per year. id invest my coins into buisness that can give me an roi higher than 4%. 
B) i personally spend way more now that bitcoin has appreciated in value. since i have more buying power.

You are right!
lightning does increase centralization, at the layer 2 of the protocol. 
Increasing block size increase centralization at layer 1 of the protocol. 
Centralization and scalability go hand in hand. The most efficient database would be an SQL server, but it would very centralized. 
The least efficient would be a database that is replicated by thousands of people on a global network. 
So the question is do we want centralization at the layer 1 of the protocol in which its failure would bring down everything built on top. 
Do we want centralization at the layer 2, where a failure would only bring down anything built above that layer.

It like going infront of pannel of oncologists and 95/100 give you a diagnosis and you, a guy with zero medical training begin lecutring them.

My tin foil hat conspiracy is that china will just like they do to every internet company that has tried to access china. 
They seem nice and inviting at the beginning then they start to cripple the western technology and create a censored version of it. 
Would not be surprised if we see china using bitmain ASICS to mine china coin. unless they craked the whole POS thing. Otherwise bitmain is the natural provider. 
Second theory, is jihan went out on limb in the HK consensus feels like he was tricked and saving face is paramount to chinese. 
We will see if $$$ is more important than saveing face. 
Theord theory, is miners also want more control of the protocol. 
But yeah, at this point i do think we should do a UASF, although like you said. Its very tricky and i have no idea how they will avoid sybil attacks :/

Bitcoin is antifragile the more it gets attacked the stronger it becomes
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:56:17
TLDR: only the newly mined coins 
Source:  
# Does a hard fork cause Bitcoin to become two separate currencies?
The idea that people can speculate or dump coins on one side of the block chain is a common misconception. The Bitcoin protocol does not have a field for transactions to specify a chain, so ordinary transactions made just after the fork will be included in both assuming there is sufficient capacity on both sides.
Eventually, if both chains were to be in active use, newly mined coins would start to enter circulation and at that point transactions involving them would start to become valid on only one chain. Sending coins to someone on the other chain would have no effect if they use a fully validating node: they would simply never see the payment appear.
A situation where both chains are advancing simultaneously is not likely to last for long. After a hard fork with 75% of hashing power support the less supported side would be rapidly abandoned, as confirmation times on the 25% side would be much higher than normal. This in turn means the transaction backlog would get much larger until the next retargeting interval was reached, meaning a higher risk of double spending for people still on the weaker chain. Merchants and exchanges should therefore prefer the side with the most hashing power, and growth of Bitcoin is good for their businesses anyway. This would make coins mined on the 25% side after the fork unspendable with those traders, so also incentivising miners to rapidly switch to the main chain.
Because of this dynamic any actual disruption during the fork should be minimal, especially as the grace period means it will have been clear to everyone that the change is about to happen.

They should move to a code that expands continusly based on a set parameter. like # of transactions.

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:21:24
The problem is that they will not have enough hashing power to secure the network. 
To do a 51% attack on bitcoin you require around 1 billion dollars to perform the same attack on a small altcoin youd need a much smaller amount. 
Unless the banks invest in billions of dollars worth of equipment they control. But then again why would you use the bitcoin protocol if your going to centralize control.

Both will work on their implementations. One Core or Classic or XT or Unlimited. Has a good idea they will do the same thing Classic and XT are doing by adding the 75% trigger. 
Then XT will say hmm that look like a good idea, i will also sigh my block for that idea. 
If we get a stable segwit or lightning network implementation others will copy it. 
We saw it with XT they said but once they saw it had no chance the went along with classics 2mb. 
if the fork happens core will add the 2mb to theirs and keep on developing.

Just like we transitioned from: electromechanical to relay to vacuum tube to transistor to integrated circuitry.

But rest assured that it will not stop. We need processing power for AI, virtual reality, etc. Maybe we wont have faster processors for phones but i know for sure my Laptop does not work with occulus, it should...

it depends on the amount you have i guess. ive been in bitcoin for a while when i started out buying a coffee was like that 3% of my portafolio for a cup of coffee. Now if i buy a coffee it like .001% so i dont really care a hope that it costs me 10000K USD. Since i still have 99% of my BTC 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:00:04
the core part is bandwith, the larger the amount of data the easier it is to censor. 1mb can be hidden in an email or easily hidden amongst a haystack of other data. 
The larger the size the more uncensorable bandwith you gotta find. Also the more nodes the harder it is to bring down the system. if you need a 10k setup its basically DOA

For the hashing rate, I don't think that's the appropriate measure, this awesome article goes over why the important part is the security budget. [ 
There is no serious competitor to bitmain. don't know any other product that has more than a few percentage points and all competitors like butterfly labs and dragon mint turned out to be scams. id also wager that more than 51% of miners run the default firmware with bitmain backdoors. 
LN needs to settle at some point on-chain, id agree there are centralized solutions to this, where an exchange holds LN coins for you and you can spend from their wallet. But this seems counterproductive to everything we´ve worked for. 
As for the shorting part, feel you didn't read my point. Yes, they would tank the market if they did that, but they would make a killing shorting the thing so they could come out net positive even after equipment cost. They can also just mine BCH and keep making money. It distorts the economics. 
But on a serious note, awesome writeup. think you make few fair points and seem knowledgeable.

@_date: 2015-09-25 08:01:44
Some people want to use it as a means for exchange. Not for the libertarian trait. Bitcoin is lots of things to lots people. The cool part is that there is alot of companies doing different stuff. Maybe you want to buy a trezor and shop on open bazar, you can do that and others can buy bitcoin to send to there families in another country and pay low transactions fees. They dont care about all the politics. 
The nice part about capitalism is we vote with our money. The service with the most users will grow the most.

All it takes is one company that issues ERC20 like tokens on RSK. They will pump like crazy and we will see a new round of ICO scams on RSK. 
It took 2 days to port Lighting to litecoin. 
But it still has a few flaws like the federated signature thing and 10HRs to realase on RSK chain. 
They will alos hard-fork a la Vitalik and call it a proof of learner.

Not by that much. Just from mining we outflows of  (25btcx24hrx60min)/10min 3600btc x 450 = 1.6m USD in btc supply added every day. Buying 1m usd wouldn't really move the needle, he'd just soak up a few hours of mining.
