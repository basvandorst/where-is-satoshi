plus I think it's only about 30.000 lines of code, which is really not much.

You could have another bitcoin icon next to the reddit gold icon

Why do we need 21inc for that?
Why can't we just use an open-source platform like BOINC (used for Folding and enhance it with code that enables to buy/sell CPU hours?

Not sure if I'm 100% correct, but I think this is the general idea:
Botnets have control servers from where infected machines can query commands to execute. In the past, botnets could be taken down by compromising those control servers and shutting them down. 
Now you swap out the control servers with the blockchain and let the infected machines scan the blockchain for new commands. You cannot take down the blockchain like you could with centralized control servers -&gt; Problem.

The other answers here miss the most important thing: This doesn't concern you as a user, as you are able to run a thin client which doesn't require to download the whole blockchain (e.g. Electrum, Mycelium, etc.).
Yes, in a few years time there might be fewer network nodes due to an increase of cost for running them. But there is also a good to fair chance, that Moore's law will take care of that.

How about a link to TipHound instead. The content creator can share this link and whoever opens it in a browser window sees a QR code with a bitcoin address. Once this adress gets tipped, the person can see the content and the creator is forwarded the tip?

Fair point.

So what does that mean for the end user? 
Will it grow exponentially if more transactions are conducted?
Will new users one day (soon) have to download 1TB to have their client catch up?

maybe mention that future updates of the bitcoin protocol could allow for more than 8 decimal places
