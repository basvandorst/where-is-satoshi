Why are you asking for my age on this subreddit. What point will that make. I’m tired of seeing teens complaining about dips and you and many others are a prime example of why the older generation hate millennials. All these people think this is a get rich quick  scheme. They aren’t mature about the market. I’m done with this thread.

 just overnight my altcoins went up 15-20%. That’s like a third of my loss gained back in a couple hours! Seeing the volatility of this market I’m still baffled to see people on Reddit running around scared about their money like their head is cut off.
