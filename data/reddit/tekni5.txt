Yeah thought it was kind of interesting as well, thanks, my cat is nearly 20 years old.

Came across this weird picture at a Toronto National Thrift store, they had a 50% off sale so I grabbed it for $2, thought it was kind of interesting.
Wondering if someone here made this?

My initial thought was that there was a small chance it may have had something like that, but I opened it from the back and found nothing.
There is even a smaller chance that something might be embedded in the image itself, but very unlikely. However upon further examination, the center image with the couple has a few odd horizontal and vertical lines, most likley just a low resolution image, probably banding. But when I tried to scan the image, the lines I see don't seem to show up in the scan. The only chance there is something actually there might be to check via uv light, but I don't have that atm.
Image is printed on photo quality paper, also the lettering is slightly bumped/embossed. I'm guessing it's done on a specialized printer or in a print shop. Says strength in numbers in latin.
My guess is the following:
1) Someone framed a test/custom print using a random modified template and added bitcoin as a joke. Then it was tossed out/donated.
2) Some type of a gift for a wedding, may have once contained a wallet in the back.
3) Someone actually planted a wallet embedded in the image and decided to give it a way to see if someone finds it.
Also I separated the frame to see if something may have been in the seams, because one of the seams was exposed, but nothing was there. I'll fix it later, it's just pegged by a couple of metal pieces and some wood glue.

Yeah I checked, nothing in the back.
