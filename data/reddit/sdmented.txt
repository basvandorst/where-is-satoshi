So I don't get it, 6 upvotes, 6 downvotes.  who would down vote something useful?  They don't like knowing the information?  That if the hashrate and difficulty keep increasing that BFL products are going to be obsolete before they even saturate the market?

The chart tries to pull data from the google docs historical data for bitcoin.  Just tell it to ignore updating the data when you open it.  
You can download a copy and edit the numbers and they will change everything.  
I understand not all of the data is 100% accurate, its a predicting chart.  Also the dollar amounts on some of the data are higher than they should be to account for shipping, tax.. etc.

That's why I made it all easily editable.. I wasn't sure on some Watt ratings and I figured it at a much higher hashing rate to compensate for the delay in ordering a machine today.  Over compensated a bit maybe.

Yeah, and I knew that when making it.  I just like rounded numbers, for the sake of any estimate I'd rather guess lower than higher..    Also, thanks!  Many hours went into this.

I spent hours making this chart, trying to get people to have some awareness but also do your own math.  It looks like Jalapenos (BFL) will be pretty useless if hashrates increase too much.  Anyways look through it.. its pretty extensive.

I added xCrowd to the list, and increased the network hashrate to 800th assuming we will be there by the end of next month.
