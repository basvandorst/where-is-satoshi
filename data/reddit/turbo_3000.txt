some corrections lasted over a year... i.e. if there is a correction don't expect to be back on terms for another 18months

ah cool, i think if you have the dicipline to invest a little each month i.e. the dollar cost average method, this way you are supposedly better off with risk.  i think market is still on the decline still ..... china is pulling out slowly over couple of months.... 
 "this coin network (huobi.com) will stop all virtual currency trading business; "
same with OKCoin and other chinese exchanges that serve local and international customers in china. probably ban mining too but not sure!

What about the apps though like google Authenticator or ledgers authenticator surely these are different

I hope they make a solution where all signing can happen offline.  This way having a dedicated computer with no internet access means user is safe from online malware attacks.  You simply then have to copy the signed transaction (which is tied to the correct addresses and amount and in no way can be altered without being invalid) to an online computer to have it broadcast to the network.

A clean computer? You mean one thats reformatted and preinstalled with latest windows updates, with firewall, anti virus.... then you have to connect to internet, type in wallet provider address exactly to avoid phishing and then trust the developers of that website aren't going to steal your private keys.... i would rather trust ledger over a website wallet... websites get updated far more often and so easier for developer to add malicious code then remove it

true i agree somewhat its just not as practical if you access your coins more than couple times a year. and you HAVE to put your trust somewhere. it is the same as SSL certificates, reddit is veriffied by "DigiCert Inc" I don't know who they are but the green padlock means its secure my trust is in micosoft that manages the list of valid certificat providers  on my computer through windows update such as "DigiCert" .  If i had admin access to your pc i could install my own and you would probably be none the wiser.... Anyway I would rather trust ledger who's sole purpose is to make it secure than to enter my private key onto a computer that may have keyloggers, screen grabbers in a room with  webcams, cctv or full of people looking at my private key or even a phising website which looks like my wallet provider. as ledger is cold and offline 99.99% of the time if a vector is attacked you can be sure ledger will have notified and patched before you could blink, it is open source too so always being tested..

out of curiosity why now? the dip? what is your expectation

you can recover your wallet with the private key i.e. the 24 words you used to setup the ledger.  you store the 24 words on paper in a safe and only get it out if you lose your ledger.  your ledger has an 8 digit pin and can also use 2fa on phone therefore you can sign/pay for things without giving away your private key.  as the signing happens on the device noone or no software can access the private key, if someone sees you entering your pin and using 2fa they would have to steal your ledger and your phone... in the mean time you could recover the wallet and transfer your funds to another address if they stole these two and knew your pin and thumb print to your phone. a ledger is no safer than a paper wallet ie.e you entering the full private key in every time, but more convienent enter pin and 2fa. if someone sees or photos your private key they can steal your funds, if they spot your pin they still need the device.
