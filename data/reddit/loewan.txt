Just wanna add that Electrum is a pretty decent setup.
Tail supports that so you can cold boot into a custom built Ubuntu. While its not an absolute cold wallet, it is still pretty sterile.
Getting a Trezor will basically turn that into a hardware wallet with really strong 2FA.
Electrum also support Dash and can work off the same Trezor. I have managed to cut my loss by 50% by fleeing into DASH through Shapeshift.io
On Shapeshift.io, since everything are done almost instantly, nothing is stored on the server. Last time it was hacked, the hacker got almost nothing.
Ledger Nano S supporting ETH now so between Dash-BTC-ETH, Trezor with Electrum and Ledger is a very safe setup.
For around 150 bucks, this kind of security is well worth the dough!
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:01:23
Yeah, I did something similar and put a contract address as my shapeshifter out address. Tech support got onto it fast and sent the ETH to my wallet. Awesome response.
Last time they got hacked, customers lost nothing and it just moved on.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:24:59
I started off with blockchain.info wallet because it was the go-to wallet. Then, my major cache went on paper wallet in case of hack... And then eventually towards Ledger HW.1. I eventually got myself a Trezor and Nano S to inc Dash and ETH.
Apart from being free, how much of a head start did blockchain.info have over Trezor? What is its share of the hardware market?

1. It has the most hashing power, making it the most costly to attack. It is also the most tested as the longest lasting crypto.
2. It already has better growth performance and bigger market cap than some fiat currencies.
3. The two groups differs on opinion in how the system should be upgraded to handle the ever increasing transaction volume.
4. Its the oldest and best established. Yes, things like Lightning Network and Atomic Swap are coming.
5. The army of developers who had improved upon Bitcoin for the past 9 years, who will continued to do so for the foreseeable future.

I am always a little annoyed by the "solve a mathematical puzzle and you win some BTC". It makes the whole thing too game like.
Miners' real task is validating transactions, then prove that they are committed to their submission by spending CPU resources as a collateral. This prevents everyone spamming the network with false transaction results. For their trouble, the network randomly rewards the miner by creating new BTC to their names.

The reason why I have invested in BTC is because of the potential blockchain has in allowing secondary systems to be created on top of it.
The nature of private and public keys and their versatility have allowed things such as a fogging/mixing and 2 factor keys be established in quite a short space of time. When the real economists get a hold of this... The kind of financial products and instruments that can be derived will be mind-blowing!
You yourself have listed two advantages : anonymous payment and micropayment. However, you seems to want to just sweep them under them under the carpets rather than truly acknowledge their worth. Two are both games changers which will alter the way content are distributed and payment charged.
My prediction? The Blockchain in BTC is only the beginning... It has only shown humanity a glimpse of what is possible with a decentralised, and open source public ledger.
Who is to say that the Blockchain can't be used to create online market place that will effectively bind with and strengthen a cryptocurrency? Like how P2P disrupt the existing media market, how about an open source media market place that is completely decentralised, where record of sales is done via a blockchain-like record database. All the artists receive payment though an integration of bitcoin? 
By the way, that's already kind of happening.

I don't want to BS you. As the average consumer, you have absolutely NO reason to use Bitcoin.
Seriously, If you are a profession while the credentials to access the typical banking services. If you don't require remittance and is happy with a central body knowing how much you spend and the government control the value of your savings then BTC really isn't for you.
All I can say is that the blockchain, and the way you can access the network will allow a lot of smart transactions to be automated and a lot of complicated financial products to be derived. Things like 2 factor addresses and foggings are good examples, so if you are curious on BTC's true worth look them up.
Current state of BTC is like BBS compare to Reddit. It is really inaccessible to layman and too inconvenient for most people.
Give it a couple more years, buddy!

This is why it annoys me when people rants on about how unfair it is that people would get mega rich for getting in on Bitcoin early. The early adopter hodlers have seen the mad rise and catastrophic fall of the currency And through it all, they have not throw in the towel like Old Hearn here. They left their hard-earned assets within the BTC economy and not cashed out like the rest so the price would not purge any further, maintaining an income source for the miners.
The people who comes through this deserves their rewards.
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:17:01
The ETF will never happened because a high volume of BTC is under control of a single unknown entity. The value of BTC can potentially collapse if Satoshi move the BTC in the Genesis blocks. Most of us hodlers believe that will never happen but it's a huge existential risk that could wipe out billions of dollars worth of investment.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:01:14
I don't think anyone would object to an eventual hardfork but should it be implemented so early?
And what is the required blocksize in order for BTC to be on par with Visa? This figure is beyond what Moore's Law can offer. 
If such growth is unobtainable EVER and by chasing after it your are ultimately centralising mining, why not squeeze out sidechains and a fee market?
This is the only way to compete with VISA!

Well, the only possibility I see is that a really sophisticated malware gain control of your online wallets but presuming you still have your fund, that hasn't happened yet.
Alternatively, your MyTrezor might be spoofed to display a public address that the attacker control instead of one from the seed in your Trezor. In this case, test with small number of coin, then move the rest from your online wallet to the Trez.
Your coin is not safe until it is secured in the vault.

Yeah, the clients will mostly likely introduce the option to choose which chain you want to operate in. 
The two network will behave like two independent Altcoins, while the market weigh in their values. The likelihood is that both chains will retain a split value of the original BTC, and the new BTC will be available for trading on exchanges.
The ETH/ETC was the perfect case study.
An important point to note was that when ETH split, a new attack vector was introduced. As the ETH/ETC was moved within their respective network, the same signed transaction was "replayed" on the other to steal fund in the other network.

The private keys are stored within the chip and are never revealed so it can never be copied and replicated.
Everytime you want to send, mytrezor will ask for a signature from the chip. The recipient's address is displayed on Trezor itself and you have to physically press the button to confirm.
The two possible vectors of attack are hacking their firmware distributions or infecting your computer so any Bitcoin address is changed to the attackers own address.
The first vector is a very direct attack will need to hack into Trezor HQ and break the firmware signature. The users will then need to update the firmware before anyone knows what's up.
The second one will con you out of individual transactions but your private keys are never revealed. As long as you realise your transaction is void and stop sending using that computer, the remainder of your fund is safe.

You sound really arrogant.

Writing down the 12 words would probably be less effort than the forms you had to fill out for a bank account and you somehow bypassed this simple step.
And now... Here you are... A massive rage quit essay.
Please. Don't tell anyone you were ever involved with Bitcoin. I am serious.

Come to think of it, I am no longer sure why the halvening will affect the price too much. The majority of the BTC that can ever exist have already been mined and are already in circulation. The miner rewards and rate of new coins being released is like a drop in the ocean now. I don't see how halving that would have much of an effect.

If you keep spending from the same address, then it would be easy for someone to look up all your transaction using a Blockchain reader.

Beyond this, there are more sophisticated ways to mask your tracks using "fogging" or switching through Altcoins.

Example: everyone knows that the Genesis block is owed by Satoshi and their public address. So all he had to do is signed the statement: "I am still alive [date]" and publish the statement and the hash.
The community can comfirm that the statement and the hash can only be produced by someone who controls the Genesis block without the private key from being revealed.
Now consider credit card payments where you have to give out ALL the details, that could potentially enable the receiver to effectively impersonate you. Cryptocurrency is a very robust system. It's little mechanisms like this that got me into it.

The fact that the news covered it breaking 1000 is already a massive boost. It will take around 3-4 days for most exchanges to accept new registrations so we still have another 2 days of mass hike.

They can technically NEVER acquire all the bitcoins as a lot of it have been lost. People loses their hard drives or private keys all the time.
Furthermore, the market will react to the demand: As the guy accumulates and remove BTC from the market, the price will keep going up due to reduced supply. Unless he could dampen the mood of the market to reduce demand, the price per bitcoin will be exorbitantly high. 
Furthermore, such a hike would further galvanise some peoples believe that it will go into 100,000 USD so they would continue to hold. Or new investors will arrive to take profit or hold, making it impossible to finally all accessible coins.

I highly doubt early investors would sell on the recent hikes. The percentage increase over the recent months were quite puny compare to what happened pre-2013. If they held through those then it would be quite bizarre for them to sell on so little gain.
We have recently had Segwit locked in and that's due for activation in the coming weeks.
Also, if Trump making a mess inside and outside... We are nowhere near the high.
Seriously, I am sure everyone could understand if some people need to cash out for extreme circumstances but to liquidate everything to take profit is a little short-sighted or ill-informed.

Bitcoin has actually forked once and a fix was implemented quickly and effectively.
In regards to competition, its never about what's better but more about the network effect. The underlining infrastructure and companies with stakes have pretty much entrenched BTC as the mother. No altcoin could overtake it in a short space of time, no matter how good.
The encryption used by BTC can be easily interchanged by some another encryption technique.

My take: Bitcoin's rise through 2016-17 was stimulated by political upheavals like Trump, North Korean and Brexit. Trump will either continue to get more unruly or get impeached, both of which will be in BTC's favour. Brexit will get more and more chaotic as we close in on the 2 year deadline. The weakest links in the Euro Zone (Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland) are all reporting early signs of instability.
It would seem all the political catalysts that drove up the price of BTC will amp up. Also, Future products will most likely act like a stamp of approval and open the floodgate to Wall Street money.

But this is the essence of capitalism: people with wealth invest it into something they believe in. When the system/company utilise the capital to grow and succeed, the investors are rewarded.
The difference with from existing systems and institutions is that the blockchain is not under control of the early adopters like banks or companies which they hold stocks.
The genius of this system is that everyone just feeds and maintain it while it remain unbiased and incorruptible.

Mate, I know about the 50% because I was there! The community made a stink about that so the pool turned down their hashing power or risk getting shunned from the network. Another example I have used was UASF - when the community chose which blockchain to support based on the policy or software version. The key here is that crypto is it's all open source software so if you want you can peer into how the whole system operates and vote using various methods.
Ooohhh... I get it... So in the broader sense, on a global scale, you are still trying to project your circumstance onto people residing in other countries. If you are in China, would you trust Alipay or WeChat Pay if you know the Central Chinese Government will have complete control on what you spend your money on? You might trust Visa and give them custodial power but what if you have a certain politic persuasion and they decide to blockade you? Bro... Consider your own lifestyle and traditions... How many people on this planet have the same facility as you?
Yes, I hold gold and platinum too. And I am also into crypto which is invisible, highly portable and can be transmitted within 10 minute to anywhere in the world. 
Well, I am not even here to debate. I am just sharing my knowledge and understanding. I think what you need to appreciate is that all the questions you have, I have already considered and they have either been addressed after I took deep dives into how blockchain works and how it reacts to stress during different circumstances. It's about observing how the community reacts to the drama that unfolds. And no, don't come back in 10 years time. You need to stay here and watch the drama unfold and note how the system and the community cope under stress. What you saw 2017 is bullshit. It was all noise from the speculators. You can only see the real community during the "winter".
Yeah. Land, tools, livestock is good if you want to hold your ground as a survivalist but there are those of us who wants to remain mobile and have assets that are portable and easy to move.
Satoshi is currently sitting on a large cache of Bitcoin and it's all transparent for all to see. He hasn't moved any that we know of. And going back to the point I have made repeatedly... If anything were to go wrong, then the open source community will catch on and create a fork that will correct any malicious action. The blockchain will fork and everyone will migrate away from the sinking ship. 
So I keep my crypto on hardware wallet and the community is transparent enough that I could trust the community is raising the alarms on bad actors. Also, the reasoning you have in trusting visa (they will behave to stay in good grace of it's customers and maintain their long term profit) also applies to exchanges and miners too. In fact, a Dark Web BTC mixing literally spent out your sentiment and they have operated for years! Or so I have been told. :p
I think the key here is that you can't personally find use for crypto, just like I don't have any use for guns and ammo. And just because the majority of the civilised world have no use for guns and ammo, to would also be pretty preposterous for me to say that they are useless.
Overall, what you are doing is called the "Nirvana Fallacy". Until humanity loses its capacity for deceit, there will always be a record system that would appear illogical and wasteful to maintain. The reason why you think it's OK to trust Visa is because you grew up with it and you don't have an alternative. You are still paying for their services, their charge backs and losses through hacks one way or another. The VISA hires hundreds, if not thousands, to deal with these frauds and losses. Try visualise VISA with all their offices and agents. The only difference with crypto is that you will be trading with people you trust when you can't trust the establishment. You are free to peer into it's inner operation because it's all open-sourced and all the transactions are transparent on the Blockchain.

So I didn't say that it became more valuable because it's more expensive to produce. I am saying now that it is worth more, that's why it costs more to protect it. The fact that consumes more to secure the network do not mean it's anti-efficient. Google probably required more infrastructure to maintain and secure it's database compare to 2005 be it doesn't mean it's and less efficient.  
Also, reports of excessive electricity consumed by digital entities is nothing new. They went after WoW, Second Life and Google Cloud: [  
 
So in regards to the centralisation of decision-making. This is what the ABC vs SV hash war has been about. Different fraction of developers and miners wanting to take BCH in different directions so they created a fork. We, the users, still have a choice to opt in or out, through buying and selling of the coins, depending how we see the motives behind each collective. You can argue one could do the same with banks but blockchain is open sourced and transparent for all to see, whereas banks can operate in a black box for years before something bad happens.  
I have been using Bitcoin for the purpose it was designed for. I did't pay for model trains but I did put a down payment on my paraglider and skipped on the oversea wire fees. Also sent donations to struggling friend to pay rent.  
Here's the thing, what happened during the 2017 run up was mindless exuberant that has repeated time and time again throughout human history - people didn't spend any time to look up what's happening so they got conned or they got in at the top. No technology in the world that give it's user control can then stop people from doing the wrong things. It has always been about taking responsibility and enjoy freedom OR having someone look after you and protect you from the mean people, or worse, yourself.  
Your position is basically that of an iPhone user claiming Linux is useless. I mean I understand that you think that as a consumer, you want a product that works and everything will be drag and drop. Blockchain is a very powerful thing but we are still on dial-ups at the moment.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:24:19
Not sure how I agreed on that. 
Anyway, so let me put this another way: So the market cap of Bitcoin has increased from, say, 4 years ago. So therefore the maximum total value of transactions it can facilitate would be significantly more than it's capable of 4 years. So the energy required to operate and protect this system has also increased proportionally, because the miners will only spent as much as it is paid in Bitcoin. There will always be an overhead to operating a system of trust, because of humanity's capacity for deceit. 
Actually... You need to grasp the essence of decentralisation here... The operation of the hardware infrastructure is centralised but the decision making aren't. Even on the most basic level, hodlers have the option to choose which coin or fork they follow and support by shifting their hodling. They sell what they don't believe and buy whichever they support, the price for the useless coin dives and miners switches off. "ETH and ETC" is the perfect example. Some people believed the network should be immutable and organisation (TheDAO) should be allowed to crash and burn (ETC). Others believed that the network should be malleable and the record should be changed if a major catastrophe had occurred and they supported (ETH). This is just market dynamics. 
Even on a hardware level, the miners don't ever get a final say. The nodes can also choose which miners they interact with. During the block size debate, there was a specific group of nodes (UASF) that would only interact with miners which have implemented a Segwit upgrade.
So imagine if say Edward Snowden has 100 BTC and the US governemnt managed to gain control on all the BTC miners (even though that would be near impossible) and change the software so Snowden's account is frozen. When that happens, people can fork out into BTC-Snow where Snowden is protected and the people who support the sovereignty of individual can mine this new coin, sell their BTC to support BTC-Snow. Depending on the proportion on the hodlers ideology, the market will balance out so the BTC:BTC-Snow will split depending on what people belief and effectively voted for.
The soft point of the system argument is weak. Even if you have the most sophisticated system, you can never prevent the user from being conned. Bitcoin security have actually came leap and bounds since 4 years age. Your coins will be very safe if you use a hardware wallet. And how many times have companies got hacked and had thousand of credit card details stolen? Again, no matter how good a system is, you can't prevent users from giving out their credentials to someone else. The difference with cryptocurrency is that I can remove this soft spot by running BTC from a hardware wallet.
There might be a lot of spelling mistakes in the above post. Can't be bothered looking it over.

One pool currently has 51%? This is the current distribution. 
Your article is from 4 years ago.
So we are comparing the merits of fiat against crypto and yes, you can change ZWL to USD to hedge against poor government financial government policies. The only difference with crypto is that during a fork, you automatically get your original stakes in the parent coin mirrored onto the forked coin. And YES! You are correct in switching from fiat to gold comparison. A lot of users see crypto as a more high tech version of gold.
So with economy of scale, EVERYTHING will weer towards centralisation one way or another. What makes crypto special is that a huge portion of decision-making is still left to the users. BTC miners still had to obey the opinions of the users otherwise everyone will sell, whereas with USD the Feds can do whatever it wants because you HAVE to use it's legal tender. For those who are willing to put in the effort of understanding the ins and outs, it is a very powerful tool to protect their assets from financial blockades and poor monetary managements.
So far we haven't even seen how Bitcoin will perform in the very environment it was designed for. It's like watching a dirt bike being driven around a race track by people who didn't bother to read the manual and specs. 
So credit card for when you can trust the establishment, to be used with peers you can't trust. Bitcoin is for when you can't trust the establishment, to be used with peers you can trust. For example, WikiLeak used Bitcoin to survived the financial blockade. It's also the reason why Satoshi left the community.  
Sorry I didn't provide any sauce but I didn't post anything outlandish. Everything I have posted are common knowledge for most people who have kept up with this space.

No, I am not talking about them trading in crypto. I am talking about them using blockchain to replace their existing technology. For example, they want to make a clearing system that allow the inter-bank transactions without having to pay a central clearing house for the service.

@_date: 2018-11-24 09:15:57
The article attempts to do away with the resources spent in preventing fraud or adversarial actions against a system. With credit card, you have charge-back and a whole industry of fraud recovery agents. With currencies, you have counterfeit measures like hologram, special paper/ink, then you have bank vaults and security agents to enforce their ownership. What most articles commonly do are to form incomplete comparisons in the hope to make cryptocurrencies look more inefficient than they really are.  
One of the articles I came across actually compared the cost of mining Bitcoin with the mining of metal ore... The problem with this argument is that "Mining Bitcoin" also includes the resources consumed to operate the Blockchain. It already includes the costs of all the transactions within the entire ledger. It is the energy consumed within the entire 10 min life-cycle whereas you mine a metal ore, you still need to add on the transport and refinery process, cutting and manufacture to turn it into something actually useful.  
The simple fact is that the Bitcoin Blockchain consumes as much resources as the value it is meant to protect. Just like if you have a fancy car, you might want to put that in a more secured place instead of leaving it unlocked. The article you have linked completely failed in addressing this balance and claimed that it got more and more inefficient. Truth was, Bitcoin was consuming more energy to protect itself... Because it's worth more.  
So there are times when I would feel disillusioned on whether cryptocurrency will reach adoption but it's not because that the system doesn't work.  It often feels like people don't want freedom and independency. The economy is running fine and what the banks did back in 2008 is water under the bridge. QE is fine because people who get into housing and stock are rich. There is no need for something to preserve their assets because most people don't want to spend the time or the energy to take charge. They just want a quick solution with fallbacks or someone they can point fingers at. They just can't be bothered to read or understand from the first principles but instead make shallow comparisons that doesn't reflect the truth.   
It's fine... Now do try and keep up... When the IMF is suggesting that they should have their own version of crypto... When banks want their own version of the Blockchain... Surely, the underlining technology in allowing a transparent, fair system of record that is free from intermediary must be sound! Otherwise... the IMF, the banks would have NEVER to even attempted to get into it because it's a broken machine. The reality is that Bitcoin has survived the most corrosive cyber environment imaginable. A place where elite hackers eager to do anything for a profit and Bitcoin have managed to survive THAT then climb upward and onward into the light... And into the mainstream conscientiousness to give a choice to the people in Cyprus, Argentina, Valenzuela, Iran, China. A choice in storing their wealth in a decentralised system.

No, with that you always need dedicated hardware that is tamper proof. For example Trezor as a wallet and tamper-proof holographic labels/laser etching/unique e-ink chip with tumbling ID. 
All the blockchain does in this case is reduce the sheet of stats on a certificate to a label linked to a distributed database with no one controlling it as a gate-keeper. 
Considering how much vintage wine market is worth, a open-source standardisation of the quality data system would be highly productive.

OK... The easiest to explain this is that BTC is divisible down to 8 decimal places. So even if 90% of available bitcoins are not on the market, the remaining 10% will still accommodate whatever purpose need, the only difference is that each whole BTC will be worth more because the supply is locked. Same reason why ETH skyrocket during ICOs.

It's not offline but air-gapped. Even if your computer is hacked, it won't be able to access the Ledger chips to get at the private keys. All the computer is broadcasting is the transaction, already signed and hashed. The hacker can't deduce the your private key from that.

That won't happened for a long time (until next century, someone please correct me if I am wrong), and when it does the miners will live on the solely on fees which senders attach to their transaction.

The only way to ensure continue of adoption is go out and spend your BTC. I grew up through the time of the 56k modem and remember how email wasn't much of a thing back then. Eventually the more people use it, the more widely accepted it became until now, when you have the excessive "cc" company emails. 
So far, I have had meals, drinks, paid for cam girls, purchased a fire-staff, donated to charities (inc. one that uses UAV to carry out search n rescue mission on Syrian Refugees) and placed a down payment on my paraglider using Bitcoin. 
Theoretically, without all the market madness, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, meaning that what you have will be worth more later on which that is one of the essence of Bitcoin. A coffee costing 10mBTC should costs 5mBTC later on in time. Your hard earn BTC isn't going to go down in value in ten years time (if the BTC ecosystem remains healthy). Another way to look at it is that you can avoid the a year's worth of coffee in USD, put all that money in investment or saving then earn the interest in ten years time. With a bigger bank balance, the coffee you pay will be cheaper relative to how much you spend now.
Another point is that cash is not very fast and can't be safely sent over long distances. Furthermore, the money in your bank account is not ultimately yours and can be seized by the government with other payment systems turn against you. Bitcoin is the reason WikiLeak is still running.
Seriously though, if you are an average consumer then wait a couple of years until the world catches up. Personally, I wanna escape the banking system. I want to support a system that can allow people to transact beyond the control of the government. I am looking forward to a time when I can send anyone on earth money for product and services.

Erm... Then I will just hold on to the BTC and use international wire then. LOL!
The point is that BTC and Rebit offered a cheaper alternative if you know how to roll. I sent during the "boring" time in March 2015, when the price fluctuation was about 2%. During that period was when BTC was REALLY useful. I was spending my coins on hostels and meals without that nagging feeling that I am missing out major.
Yep... Those times were nice. :D

The supply and demand will always balance out with price changes. If the bitcoin are scarced due to lost or held BTC then each coin's value would skyrocket, while a lower denominator will be used to compensate (each coin can go down 8 digits).
The fact that coins will be lost had always been taken into account and that's what gives it its deflationary characteristic.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:47:15
Converted HKD into 4.9BTC on ANX BTC, then watched the exchange rate on Rebit.ph and made sure I don't lose out. I was lucky because it went up enough to cover for the 1% I paid to ANX to get the BTC.
Put in an order for 50000 PHP with the bank details of my instructor, scan the QR, send from ANX and bam, a cash deposit was made to the legacy bank account the same afternoon, which actually didn't registered on his bill next the next day.

During the first couple of months, it would have been crypto nerds hanging out at obscure forums, looking at the right threads at the right time AND having the foresight to take notice of the White Paper Satoshi wrote.
Starting a miner would also require a lot of coding too.
On top of this, people who get rich from mining in the beginning must has had nerves of steel and truly believe in BTC. They should had seen meteoric rises and soul crushing crashes.
Mate, if someone who mined coins at the beginning and held on until the moon must had really believed in the technology.

"For from free earthling to free earthling ... ...the word was spread that bold Bitcoin and it's Blockchain... ...so far from home... ...laid down their lives not just for money... ...but for all internet and the promise this global community holds. Now, here at the frontier of innovation... ... The banker hordes face obliteration! Just there the suits huddle... ...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts... ...with icy fingers... ...knowing full well what merciless horrors they suffered... ...at the resilience and utility of the first crypto. Yet they stare now across the plain at 10,000 alt coins... ...commanding 30,000 side chains! The enemy outnumber us a paltry three to one. Good odds for any Techhead.

It's also an established infrastructure, like Western Union that is own by everyone who have the tokens with limited supply. The tokens allow the flow of worth from one party to another, beyond the grasp of governing entities.
Take Wikileak, Chinese capital flight as example.
The fact that BTC is getting more accepted (eg. More Western Union branches) adds to its utility value, increasing its price above other Altcoins that might be technically better.

Have a look at bit2factor.org. It will show you how the most elementary and bog standard multisig could work. 
It basically get a passphrase from you, then provide you with an intermediate code to send to your trade partner. Your trader partner will then get a public key and encrypted private address using the intermediate code. The original private key will need the passphrase and encypted private key to unlock.
You pay into the public address, then wait until the good arrive and give them the passphrase.
Alternatively the trader can gice you the encrypted private key (which you can unlock with your passphrase) as a refund.
You better try it out on bit2factor.org. Its been a while since I last used it.
Edit: correct name to bit2factor.

I wouldn't say I am scared, I am just extra careful. Like I would double-check if I've typed in my credit card detail properly, I would triple check with BTC, pause then click. Then I would go straight on blockchain.info (I know there are better ones, but I had this bookmarked and it works 99% of the time) and mash the F5 button.
The biggest scare I had was a textbox not displaying all the characters so the end looked different from the one on the website. The website taking the BTCs registered the payment anyway so I was alright after a fresh pair of pants.

I had to forward 25000 for my lesson in paragliding in Manila. 40USD was taken from the banks for the oversea transfer. I was gonna use Bitspark but couldn't find their storefront. Will definitely look harder next now that I know how much the bank charges. It was pretty messed up that I had to exchange to USD first THEN send it my instructor's account. So much effort with a huge overhead!

Are you looking for an alternative for your ill-gained fortune after BTC-e? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:44:56
I wish people would stop this redistribution of wealth crap. Bitcoin never promised to get rid of capitalism. It rewards the early supporters/investors. Yes! Those who got there early and started mining at the beginning will be mega rich if they held because it was very difficult to start mining back in 2009. 
I tried getting the BTC wallet back in 2010 but it was a time before wallets with separate copies of the Blockchain. I gave up because I could not be bothered downloading the 20gb (I could be wrong, maybe it was bigger) blockchain. 
It's even harder to hold onto your Bitcoin after all these years, with its stellar rises and catastrophic tumbles. I got in 2013 and went through with the 2014 crash. Held through 2015 to where we are now.
Sorry but if you want redistribution of wealth you have came to the wrong place. All BTC had promised was a system for registering values that can't be artificially inflated or be shout down by the government (e.g. WikiLeak). Anyone with the resources can contribute, even at a disproportionate rate (ASIC miners) to the point that the difficulty is so high that normal CPU and GPU can no long compete. We are all cool with that.
The reason I managed to get cheap coins was because during the 2014 slump, miners were turning off their rigs because the block rewards were so low that it wasn't economically feasible to mine. I throw in whatever spare cash I could, foolishly thinking that it will help. I believed that Bitcoin is the first of its kind that will help resist the psychopaths gatekeepers who are happy with seeing thousands of people on the street after their homes were foreclosed. It is one of our best hope and it must not fail!
I am sorry if BTC is not good for you. Good bye.

After the MtGox the market went on a continuous bear market through 2014. During this time, the price of BTC was so low that some miners were turning off their rigs because the rewards were getting so low that it was no longer financially unfeasible.
At the time, I was doubling down. Throwing in whatever I could spare, foolishly thinking that might make a difference with the price. All the time, I was thinking: "This technology MUST survive! This is one of our few tools to break the deadlock which the gate-keepers have over us! The same psychopaths who would throw thousands out of on the street, while reap the rewards as their entitlements.
BTC was propped up earlier by geeks who understood the mathematics and truly believe. 
Edit: bull to bear.

Same. My friend told me about it back in 2010 but it was way too hard to get one. Plus all the "fogging" was beyond me. 
Came 2013, AXN opened shop, wallet apps came about. I looked into it again with the realisation that BTC had survived the dark web?!?! The underbelly where the law dodging, tech elite opportunists make their killings? How can it remain as an effective store of value against such odds!?!
Read the white paper and went through page after page of introductory tutorials and videos. It must had took me a week to grasp how such a concept could work, then everything fell into place. When I started exploring things like bit2factor.com, I truly realise how communicative and malleable the network is. The sandbox and open nature of the system had me in shock.
I member that I was reading about change addresses right at the point when most wallets were switching over to sweeps.
Then the BTM came along... :D
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:44:19
I got in at the Mt Gox Implosion and only heard about Butterfly Lab as they were folding in.
There were some really rough times, guilt and self-doubts through 2014-15. "Why did I potentially pissed all that money on something that will never catch on!??!" But every couple of weeks I would check on the price then Reddit... "It's not completely dead yet"... "And wow... Look at this next BIP"... "A new hardware wallet or ATM has been released". 
I remember there was a time when the price kept plunging that there was a joke on Reddit that good news actually drives the price DOWN.
I think there was even a time when I bought BTC because the price was tanking so hard that miners were shutting down so I was throwing what little I could spare in hope it would help... But look at where we are now. :D Honestly, I seriously can't wait until UASF. 
I guess the only difference was that, I LOVED and enjoyed it all. There was no stress because I have only invested what I could earn back. On top of this, every hobby and passion I have indulged in - fire-spinning, St John Ambulance First Aider, paragliding, beekeeping have all open up new worlds for me. It's the same with BTC. I have learned so much about public:private key operations, encryption standards like SHA256 and most important of all: What is this funny thing called money, that people are willing to die for.
Through it all, I never forgot the very reason I got into Bitcoin. The very message enshrined in the Genesis Block... It was the only fighting chance we had at the time against a corrupt society that would support the over-privileged while stampede over the weak and desperate. The relentless and unchecked greed that resulted in the plight of so many... FFS, one of my friend almost killed himself because the situation got so bad for him in 2010.

No, the circumstance is COMPLETELY different compare to April now. The infrastructure is so much better now to prevent the hacker attacks. AND the Chinese are involved now and their market will blindly pick up any BTC you throw out.
Put it this way, I am working in Hong Kong right now. Was offered a iPhone 5 with my contract when it first came out. Sold it off for a 60% profit because the mainland Chinese have so much spending power that they could inflate values of commodities WAY beyond!

It's simple, China has came a long way in the past 50 years and there is no point in them risking all they have worked so hard for for the sake of innovation. They have virtually got the US by the balls with the debts. So why gamble with something that they might not be able to control further on down the line. They have done the same thing when State owned company went public on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
On top of that, they have Google, YouTube, Facebook and Falungung banned, along with a massive library of websites filtered by the great firewall.
Banning bit coin seemed almost natural.

@_date: 2013-12-14 08:55:41
Recent negative news? I think the recent news have been somewhat mixed, as per usual. You still have people warring either side over the future of BTC, but this is not important unless you are in for the short term speculative gains.
Overall, the impression I get from the "experts" is that they are still looking at BTC from a classical economic prospective, even when the underlining transaction structure is something that has never seen before.
I think the thing we need to focus on for long term success is overall adoption. 
ZipZap would be something I would keep my eyes on, because if it works as a proof-of-concept then I am sure others will follow suit. The implication of enabling the mass to purchase BTC with ease will be enormous!
On top of this, there are rumours of Wall Street piling in onto the growing investment that is already pouring onto Bitcoin startups.
To be honest, I hardly check Bitcoinwisdom anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:19:36
So I guess the key is to find a process that is hard to solve but easy to check. Isn't the validation in the BTC blockchain are done by the nodes through confirmations anyway. So can't the same be applied where the network flip-flop between solving and checking?
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:46:54

@_date: 2013-12-19 01:16:44
In a way, I think the China Crash should give BTC a little more credibility. I mean come on, they ban everything that is empowering and disruptive (FB and YouTube).
The whole China hype felt too good to be true but it was devoid of any form of substance. Yes, it was good to have more investor backing but the same bullish attitude had resulted in weird phenomenon such as empty cities and the biggest empty shopping mall in the world. This really isn't something you want with bit coin on the long run.
