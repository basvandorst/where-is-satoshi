There is already a coin called freicoin that gives a percentage of the fee to the freicoin foundation  so it is doable.
google does anything similar in 2 3 years, bitcoin is probably toast.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:39:35
all the alt coins are more or less the same shizzle also
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:06:49
no they don't control it, the network controls it.  there's just an addition of this: a small % all transaction fees goes to one account.
and to be fair i have no idea if it's even possible.
NO ONE IS ANSWERING MY FUCKING QUESTION wtf.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:35:42
right but we're talking about incentives here also, there was no incentive to move to fb.  there's a HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE incentive for miners to just start mining for google.
let's say google says's hey we're going to take .00000000001% of the mining fees, miners get their typical fee.
if you were a miner and google anounced that in 100 days they would upload google coin and let everyone start mining at the same time, why on earth would ANYone in their right mind NOT switch a huge portion of their mining efforts to the google coin??
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:19:04
right i think it would be very easy for them to get people to use it if on there front page they explained the bitcoin protocol, how people can be miners, put it there for a  100 days and said "hey it all starts at zero everyone get's a fair shot to start mining from zero, we haven't premined anything. The whole world is going to be mining don't miss out, all you have to do is install this mining program.
this is literally the only thought i have had up to now that scares me about bitcoins future.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:26:38
what if a company like google gives the world a 100 day heads up?
They release a coin.  evryone can start mining together on day 1.
could google write protocol so they recieve a very small % o transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:16:27
wow thank you.
that's all i was looking to hear.
it can or can't be done technically.
man i'm going to have to think about this.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:06:35
hello?  could they not set up a protocol in the beginning that mandates mined coin to be sent to them?
is it impossible?  like protocol is an agreement of somekind that a miner that solves the next peice of the blockchain is gets the 5 or 10 btc right?  how is that enforced?  Through what kind of agreement?  please i'm not trying to be a dick jsut trying to understand.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:07:19
well i'm getting downvoted to oblivion and NO one is really answering the question.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:11:35
haha that's not what i meant, but yeah just saying they could make a fuck load of money.  they're probably in the best only position to pull it off.
so you're saying it's possible though?  like the protocol part?
like it's possible tht all bitcoiners right now could also have as part of their protocol that a % of transaction fees goes to one spot?
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:36:37
lets say if you base a monetary system on gold and you used a bitcoin protocol to keep track of who owns how much gold, would you still need the gold?
is the question that came to mind...
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:15:10
oh fuck.  that's scary.  google + us. govt. haha whoa...
so you're sayin the solution is google premining, 
what i'm wondering is if you can create a protocol that states that transaction fees can be sent to them.
because if they don't premine, and people can't bitch about it...
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:29:51
what if they can make mining more energy efficient?  and they take a .0001% transaction fee?   and miners still get their google coin? can you imagine? 
what if you had received .00001% or even .000001% of all the transaction fees from the beginning of time?
why would they not wantto get in on that?   why would they promote something else when they can do it so big that it would literally guarantee them making more money and becoming the defacto bank of the internet into perpetuity?
and it's so easy for them, they could make trillions....  not only that why wouldn't current bitcoin miners flock to the google coin when they know the entire google user base is going to start mining?  which means faster adoption and huger gains to be had?
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:51:00
right, i got that, but in this case we're talking about Google and internet money.  bitcoing doge coni lite coin doesn't have the kind of trust that a google backed product does, and you can bet your booty that when money is involved people are going to notice.  facebook to google plus?  what's the incentive?  but getting into google coin before everyone else does? the fear of missing out on this oncce in a lifetime oppurtunity?  Google's freaking enormous user base?
 if they put out a marketing push, front page and set a timer at a 100 days, the whole world would start mining.  the miners of bitcoin would be NUTS not to move their mining resources over.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:56:44
sorry, i'm talking about added trust in terms of usage, people willing to start mining,
when i tell people about bitcoin they kinda look at me like mmhmm magical internet money ok,
if google's front page tells them, you bet your f***ing ass they'll pay atten,
and then google jsut uses exact same bitcoin protocol with miners all in agreement that a small transaction fee goes to the miners AND to google.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:08:51
so they can do a xyz protocol for sure?
for example
protocol xyz that would be 100% identical to bitcoin except with the small addition of o and .0000001% of all transactions go to google?
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:37:30
so are u saying what i am suggesting is possible?  that they can create a protocol that is p2p and decentralizedd but sends some form of transaction fee to them?
is it possible?
i'm seriously not trying to be a dick i just want to know for sure before i make any rash decisions.  as in if this is a fact i'm cashing out half my bitcoins right fucking now.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:21:44
could a bitcoin esque protocol be written so that as the blocks getting solved get bigger, bigger rewards are given?
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:44:52
so that gives bitcoin a sort of deadline, it's about user base,  if the user base isn't big enough by the time customer protection solns are in place bitcoin is done?
dang i'm seriously thinking about pulling out right now after having this thought.
steam coin
amazon coin
google coin
facebook coin
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:12:46
no what i'm wondering is about the protocol.  could they make a protocol that would give them fees that could not be overturned by miners.
if google makes a coin and announces it to the whole world and gives a 100 days notice, miners would be stupid to not mine google coin no matter how much they'd have to pay google.  because the WHOLE WORLD would be on board, the coin the mined would be worth 10000x what bitcoin is right now with that kind of user base.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:40:36
i wish someone would actually address this instead of just down voting the post.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:16:07
so if google made a protocol that says a certain amount of transactions have to go to a google account,  that protocol would stand unless there was a hard fork?
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:38:53
right that's what i'm suggesting, why wouldn't google just let it run p2p and take the smallest, i mean SMALLEst of fees?  they would still have the p2p network.  miners would be rubbing their hands because they know they have more computational power than normal people, but normal people would also finally be on the network, sheesh i own bitcoin and i'm scaring myself.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:59:39
they could make SO MUCH MONEY...
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:28:16
right so i might havea fundamental misunderstanding which i would like to be corrected.
it seems like the transaction fees and mining rewards are determined by "protocol"
can protocol be written so that w all transactions fees go to one account?
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:41:12
HOw about everytime a bitcoin article pops up on the news feed for google it's stickied on the front page.
everyone here goes and makes a simple post supporting bitcoin. or asking questions. current price i dunno anything, that takes 5 sec. to post. relinks to explantions etc.
w 100% participation, 90000ish replies every time there's an article, suddenly online news outlets are dying to do bitcoin articles and awareness grows.
suddenly everyone knows.
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:05:55
Would you explain proof of stake vs proof of work?
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:20:30
right that's what i'm getting at.
so if google made coin and got 1000000's of people to join and it's jsut like bitcoin
could google make a protocal that sends a % of transaction fees to google?
and if they can.
could only hard fork over ride that protocol?
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:24:57
wall street makes a living on the notion that they can make the most efficient investment,ie minimize risk maximize profit based on mathematics.  this is bullshit.  the whole notion of an investment is that you take on risk.  you can't minimize risk because reality happens no matter what a chart says. the idea of investing has been warped by wall street because that's how they take your money.  they make you feel safe.  they make you think they know something extra.  the fact of the matter is that they don't know jack shit.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:14:45
ok it's still pretty durn decentralized like 99% decentralized and 10000000x more useful,  the company wouldn't run the currency, they'd just recieve transaction fees like the miners.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:25:06
This to me seems to be the strongest idea, that the infrastructure surrounding bitcoin becomes invaluable to the point it's just pointless to seriously consider other alt coins.
Is it true that the bitcoin protocol can be adjusted to take on qualities/properties of other alt coins that may be "better" than certain aspects of the bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:22:34
wow.  thanks.
you are literally like your user name.
thanks so much.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:04:44
if my protocol idea can work.... but thtat's what no1 is answering....they literally have to do nothing and all the worlds transactions aren't even handled by them  if you recieved .000001% of every transaction that ever took place from here on out on the currency that everyone in the whole WORLD uses.....  in a 100 years you would have made so much freaking money .... they wouldn't even have to advertise anymore
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:16:24
Lite coin done coin alt coin user base doesn't have to be only one coin can be 1000 alt coins
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:01:48
are you 100% sure they could not?
the reason i ask is cuz i don't know.  if there's no way for them to enforce that, fears are gone bitcoin to the moon.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:00:13
what if google said they'll take .00000001% while offering to expand userbase to the whole WORLD.
miners would profit MORE, they'd still structure like bitcoin  miners would  receive transaction fees still no? except from the whole world.
they hold up the network still.  google jsut takes a small piece, but no1's really asnwering if the kind of protocol i'm talking about is possible even.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:04:54

@_date: 2013-12-01 04:06:32
Maybe, JUST MAYBE bitcoin doesn't take over the world, just the parts that need to be taken over, like overseas transaction between consumers/merchants online.
It would be really cool if you could create another protocol that acts like a kickstarter for loans, and instead of banks, large groups of people just give out partial loans and when you make a repayment the little pieces of interest go to everyone who made the loan.
Maybe in the future to get a loan you have to have a public internet profile account kind of thing that you can only make once, kinda like social security so people can see your creditworthiness.
so then it would be possible to ask for loans from everyone and you pay everyone back or something.

The blockchain is a unhackable ledger kept on the "bitcoin network". Your coin is attached to a key that has been recorded on that blockchain.  Right now coinbase holds that key.  If you wish Go to bitaddress.org and generate your own key pair. Then send your coin base funds to the public part of your key.  Now you need a wallet. A wallet is what interacts w the bitcoin network. Download a client or use blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:22:18
what you need is a system where you get a reputation score as a buyer and seller that lasts forever.  like social security, you can only register for it one time and that's it.
like a taobao ebay kind of a thing.  so you have to build up your credit, and every transaction you ever enter into is recorded.
i guess you could still do a long con kind of thing and buy cheap shit for years and buy one expensive thing and bone out.
i dunno.
actually maybe just the vendor needs the rep score.
just my 2 cents.

So you don't have a problem with the fact that some, maybe many, of the richest people in a bitcoin economy are going to be drug dealers and pimps?
I mean I don't either, but i did like how the poster did kind of dismantle some of the "idealistic" arguments made by bitcoin fans.
like oh the sytstem now is so broken.  the evil 1 percenters.  it's a currency for the people by the people.  that kind of bullshit.
i'm a bitcoin fan tho.

@_date: 2013-12-10 10:08:22
I kind of agree with this. The merchants will still adopt due to the advantages of not having to deal w credit card companies n paypal and beinh able to runa a "cash" business. Consumers can hold until they see an item that has enough utility to overcome the potential rise in value that keeps them holding.  Lets face it for all purposes bitcoin as of this very moment serves as a speculative store of wealth vehicle more than anythinh else. But that certainly doesnt mean it will stay that wau forevr.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:39:44
Well the other difference is that the network sizes as well as the number of users. Govt backing is a good thing but argentina has inflation of 25% a year. Cyprus takes 10% of all citizens moneey without warning. W a digital currency you are almost your own bank which is interesting
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:19:02
But altcoins affect bitcoin isnt it ostrich like (head in the sand) to just ignore their existence?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:10:34
inflation allows for a cushion in a business.
deflation demands perfection.
If everything were perfectly predictable, or if people were willing to place an order for something and wait 1-6 months to receive items, then we wouldn't need this cushion, unfortunately this is not the case.
poorly phrased, but the decrease in consumption is not a good thing in and of itself, what we really need is efficient consumption.  It's hard to force people to do things though.

Shadow Banking is punished by death.
This is not good news.
It makes sense though, until they can figure out a way to see how the bitcoins are being spent, there would be NO way to audit/tax people.

@_date: 2013-12-23 19:06:53
i think your confusing the chart for reality.
the chart doesn't determine reality,
reality determines the chart.
Patterns are useful for making predictions, it's the best thing we have to go on but its no guarantee.
will wider adoption stabilize the exchange rate? no one really knows.
but it's not a chicken and egg issue, no one knows how adoption will happen, but the way the adoption happens will determine the charts.
also banks should be more like credit unions, they should not be making leveraged investments, and they should not be traded publicly.  but that's just my opinion.  it's not evil but it's just dangerous, ala 2009 financial crisis.  the system is not perfect, it's what's worked until now, and pretty dang well, you're right about banks being useful, but bitcoins and future protocols like it are going to be even more useful and won't have nearly the same amount of systemic risk associated with it ala our current banking system.
also systems tend to arise organically.   and mass bitcoin adoption will happen or not happen... not because people are arguing about how useful or useless it is, but because people will either find it useufl or they won't
god that was rambly.

Is it true that the protocol that you must send the entire amount in an address for every transaction?  If so then Is the new address that the change goes to generated automatically? Or is it that when you send a transaction out you are required to enter in a new address the change goes to?
