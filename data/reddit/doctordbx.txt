It is guaranteed I will have a finite number of farts in my life, therefore each fart is scarce. As I'm roughly 40% through my expected lifetime, already half of my farts are out there in the market.
This means there's only a limited time and opportunity to get fresh farts.
But hurry, each fart I produce gets snapped up pretty quickly... you can't question this scarcity.
I can feel a fart coming on right now... want to buy it? Hurry, the value is likely to go up between now and the next fart.

I don't think anyone particularly likes banks, mostly because banks generally make enormous profits from others people's money and usery. They have however, served a need for thousands of years that have made them a necessary evil.
I have a pretty good bank (Suncorp Australia) and to be honest, they make it difficult for me to hate them. The services they provide are excellent and their online banking system is the best I've ever used. I've never felt "I wish my bank could do...".
The influx of VC is interesting, but remember this is not an investment in Bitcoin alone. It's an investment for Cryptocurrencies, which in the big picture, although uncertain of what that need is, I can see that there is demand for them.
What needs to do you see Bitcoin fulfilling, or in other terms, what problems does it solve that aren't already solved by other means?

It's all very easy to get caught up in the hype of things. This subreddit itself is guilty of lavishing praise and pushing N&amp;B relentlessly... up until the point where it was clear Danny had done a runner.

Regarding ASIC manufacturers I think this is in line with the paradigm of mining. In the beginning, the easy to get 'coins' were picked up off the ground.
As these were exhausted, coins needed a bit more effort to find, so people had to dig for them.
The further down they dig, the more they started to rely on bigger and better equipment to get the coins, eventually leading to people throwing away their general purpose tools (i.e. shovels) and investing in specialist extraction machines.
I don't think there's anything wrong with this, it's supposed to increase in difficulty to obtain and require more effort.

That's contradictory. First mover advantage is viewed as a barrier and protective strategy. Something better might come along, but it's about inertia and recognition. That's the 'advantage' in first mover advantage.

It's based on a lot of averages. For those who can achieve large economies of scale it's (slightly) profitable.
For the those trying to mine on their old computer it's not.

Even if the majority did know or care about the internet in the 80s it wasn't feasible to give it to them. The technology just didn't exist to put the internet in every home, and to what end? There were no computers to really connect it to.
We had a BBS linked to our Commodore 64 in the 80s. It was frightfully expensive and really served no actual purpose or need. Pure tinker town stuff.
The population wanting to get onto the internet was a matter of breaking down the technological impediments. When those barriers were lowered / removed, the population moved.
Nobody said No. Nobody said "I don't want this email thing!". (*save a few technophobes, but really, hardly anyone.)
Bitcoin has no technological impediments for average Joe/Jill. He/She can get started right now today if he/she wants to. The barriers to entry are very low. However, the interest is also very low.

More than 20 but less than 30. Most were acquired through services, some purchased when it was around $50.


That's a good question. A couple of years I guess.


None of the above really. It doesn't actually solve a problem I have... I just got into it out of curiosity.


I don't partake in drugs other than beer and the occasional cigarette.


Just did.
My interest in Bitcoin is different from my interest in this subreddit. Firstly they are not the same thing, Bitcoin is an interesting technology that some people seem to believe fills a need that is not obvious to me. This subreddit provides insight into what needs Bitcoin fills for some people.


But to what end? Because you're a nice guy or because it will help your own investment grow? Is it altruism or egoism that drives you to build the faith?


Very little real dollars invested. If it disappeared overnight I would be probably a bit miffed but not the end of the world.


When it comes to Bitcoin, it is to satisfy my curiosity. No more.


Well, given my position, my ultimate desire is for it to succeed. I have no benefit in seeing it fail.
However, I'm a rational person who tries to make logical decisions free from emotion. I don't possess blind faith that things will improve for Bitcoin. I see many challenges ahead that are not being solved that simple cannot be glossed over, and the big one being... 'what problem does it solve?'
My own personal bio, is I run a (small) development company that develops software applications for a number of niche industries, as well as a client/server product that is consumer based (and doing OK). After discussions with the fellow directors, we have determined that Bitcoin is not for us at this stage.
I possess a degree in IT and a degree in Marketing (with honors), I also have a pet turkey.

Firstly, we're not talking about an Apple which is a non changing quantity. We're talking about a real number here which has no defined limit to it's rate of exchange. If Bitcoin were an Apple, it would be one that grew in mass at its exchange value increased and shrunk as it decreased.
LET ME EXPLAIN THIS IN SIMPLE TERMS FOR YOU... no not really, let me just say the way you write is condescending and arrogant, and I think you're the one who is getting it all wrong.
Bitcoin is not an Apple. It is not a physical thing. It is as divisible as far as you can go within the limits of the software beyond the decimal place. There is no real scarcity.
Second, AND KEEPING IT SIMPLE FOR YOU, you need a thing called critical mass to achieve the network effect. Right now, it is safe to say Bitcoin has not achieved that critical mass. In order to obtain this critical mass it needs to be in the hands of a lot more people.
SAYING IT HAS THE NETWORK EFFECT BUT THEN SAYING IT IS SCARCE IS A CONTRADICTION. (I fucking hate caps, but this seems to be the way you like to speak.)
If another coin finds itself in the hands of more people than Bitcoin, you can be sure your network effect theory is going to take a beating.

They operate as registered companies on Australian soil. They must (and most likely do) adhere to ASIC and ATO regulation on a number of matters, without even touching on GST.
We're not talking about just Bitcoin here, but if you operate and service Australia with a local footprint, then you must comply with our local laws.
Whether you can weave a tangled web or not to indemnify yourself (you might be able to, but it won't be easy) this, as a consumer, gives me absolutely zero confidence in buying or selling through your exchange.
If I invest will I be issued a tax invoice or receipt for my investment?
If I sell can I be sure that the funds I've sold won't be subject to questionable origin, foreign income taxation, or further red tape?
If you go bust, what recourse do I have? Who is regulating you so we know you are solvent?

The thing holding email back wasn't email. It was the transport mechanism, i.e. the internet.
I don't know how old you are, but I was born in 1975. In 1992 I started university undertaking a degree in IT majoring in data communications. At the time, email was available campus wide to every student regardless of their discipline, all they had to do was get to a computer.
In 1994 public uptake of the internet started to happen on wider scales. Up until this point email has near 100% saturation of the available user base. As the internet expanded into the public, email maintained this near 100% uptake rate.
Working in the sector as an IT Admin administering email servers at the time (94 ~ 99), I can tell you work was pretty good and there was lots of it. I lost count of the email accounts I setup in those 5 years and the MTAs that I setup for organisations. This isn't even including the free email providers.
Nobody ever said, well, we've got the internet, but don't think we'll need email.
**Email never struggled. Anyone who could get email DID get email. Virtually 100% of people who could get it, did get it**


It's only comparable in the context of them being **completely different** as a comparison.
Email has enjoyed near 100% takeup from those able to get it. Can the same be said about Bitcoin?

Impossible to know without looking at the routing table of the host. Maybe some trace routes to verify they're in different data centres, but if it's the same data centre then it makes it difficult.
When I setup load sharing VPS I go the extra mile to make sure I'm not just setting up another VPS on the same iron, because this is suboptimal. You might snare a greater slice of the xen or vmz host's resources, but you might also be wasting your time and money.

@_date: 2014-04-21 00:13:14


Managing ones money is kind of a 'grown up' thing. It's very important people learn how to do this.


That's not my experience with my bank. I've done large overseas transfers at odd hours to have them turn up in my overseas account within a few hours. Accounts in the same bank it is instant, no queuing at all.
For transactions that do queue, I don't see what the big deal is personally. It's never been a thorn in my side.


This is very much a bank by bank thing here in Australia. I note when I disburse wages to employees it can vary from instant to two days depending very much on who they bank with.


This never happens here. Banks tend to be open and processing 6 days a week.


Again, this doesn't happen here, or at least I can't say it has happened in my experience. If it did happen... what's the big deal?
@_date: 2014-01-30 11:00:41
I wouldn't say it was thriving or huge. The average Australian doesn't care whether Bitcoin exists or not. It is however present, and apparently we have our own Bitcoin Association, although you'd never know.
Local Bitcoin exchanges? Lots of sellers on localbitcoins (and buyers), and of course coinjar.io is Australian based.
Many local businesses? I've yet to come across one in all my dealings, but I assume they're out there.
Legislation is mostly in place and has been for currency substitutes or foreign currency purchasing. GST is required to be paid in cash for local purchases but I doubt anyone is actually adhering to this. It's all a bit grey really, although there is murmerings of the tax department actually doing something about some legislation some time or another.
Other than that, weather is great, lifestyle is great, things are great.

The existing rulings are clear, I am not sure why Bitcoin needs a separate ruling.
1. GST must be collected on transactions made with Bitcoin that would ordinarily attract GST if they were cash. Period. There is no exemption and the ATO has ruled on this previously in other non-cash transactional methods.
2. Currency exchange transactions are not liable for GST on the gross amount of the currency, but the service fee component is.
The article is misleading, and worrying for the lack of research.
Edit: To further clarify, all these articles are peppered with 'may' and 'could'. There is no explicit ruling by the ATO on Bitcoins at this stage, and no clear indication whether they need to.

Whilst I actually admire your optimism it might be worth pointing out that Richard Branson has had far more failures than successes. In fact, he's had some spectacular failures, such as Virgin Cola.
So, Branson investing in Crypto infrastructure isn't necessarily a blessing, it's just that he sees opportunity in it. He has a diverse enough portfolio that he can afford the odd risky venture, and realistically what he has invested to date is chump change for him.
That's not say you might be wrong, but Branson and his name is by no means the indicator of a good thing™

Donating to a charity shouldn't be about propping up Bitcoin. Don't you think these organisations have a hard enough time competing for funds without being appropriated as a sled for bitcoin promotion?
Donate to a charity because you believe in the charity. If you can go through the process of acquiring bitcoin with dollars, you can give dollars to a charity.
Also donating to charities is not about tax minimisation because they're tax deductible. I donate approx. 5k a year to charities in Australia. This offsets about (approx.) $2k in tax meaning it only costs me a net of $3k. Do the math, you're not saving money by donating.
The reason why tax deductions occur is it is a way to force government to support your charities. I.e. $3k from me and $2k from the government they would have otherwise collected in tax.

it's very myopic in the sense that many proponents of the adoption of 'bit' as a unit either have an agenda (Bitpay) or think it will somehow solve the buying difficulty issues and make it 'easier'.
It's also symptomatic of the contempt the average coiner feels for the general population and that somehow because you're into Bitcoins you must be smart like, and that non-coiners couldn't possibly use bit for its true meaning, so it's open season on the word.

MySpace was already dead at that point. Tom timed his exit to riches to perfection.
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:41:37
Yes I guess that point deserves a bit more of an explanation.
I've been an Amex card holder for 15 years. Suffice to say I have one of those spoofy ones they give you with a box outlining all the benefits most of which are completely useless.
In the early years, the points system was pretty good and I used the accumulated points for a number of flights. Things were great then, and it made sense.
Now 15 years later, I use it completely out of habit. No more. No less. It's the Card I use and I habitually use it, and habitually pay it off, month after month.
So bear in mind, 15 years and about a million dollars later, when I ring up Amex to question the value of the card, I am pretty much treated like a shitty customer. Don't see the value in it Dr. D? Too bad. To be fair what started off as a polite phone call to enquire if there was something more they can do for me, which they invited me to do, it ended up with some smart mouthed bitch telling me that I wasn't worth anything to them anyway.
This has since been 'smoothed over' but in all honestly right now I am making the move to another Credit Card, one that doesn't attract an extra fee to use, and promises less.
As I explained to Amex, if everyone charges me 3% extra to use the card, and points are only worth a maximum of 1.5% of the spend on the card (and now a lot less due to tiering depending on the service), I'm actually behind using Amex.
So to answer the question... habit.

Using PayPal doesn't even pop into my head, but I guess if I was stuck and had no other method of payment... because I was a financial numpty, then I might consider using PayPal.

Call me skeptical but I worked for the Dubai government for 6 years. One of the major issues for the Dubai government is currency leakage, I.e. The outward flow of dirhams to another country, the main ones being India and the Philippines.
Another major issue is money laundering through the UAE which the federal government in Abu Dhabi are intent on cracking down.
Banks already do not allow general accounts to be used for hwallah, you need a specially approved account for this and there are strings attached.
They are introducing legislation to cap the size and frequency of funds transfers to India and the Philippines because of the outward flow of cash and 'gold washing' to India.
This flies in the face of everything the government was working on when I was working with them. If this is a private company, they can expect trouble. If this is government backed, expect the machines to require an Emirates ID with restrictions on transactions.
Don't underestimate the governments ability to turn off a service they don't like. They had no issue turning off blackberry for 6 months to the 250,000 BBM users in the Emirates.

No. 20 years ago people were very curious about the internet. Business wanted onboard ASAP, people wanted to learn more about it.
It was very much seen as 'the future'. 20 years later here we are.
The major impediments to internet uptake were cost (it was expensive, especially on the old phone bill) and a lot of people needed to get a computer first. As soon as these two issues were overcome, it was plain sailing.
If the internet encountered the kind of troubles Bitcoin faces we'd still be using BBSs. But it didn't.

Like all financial instruments, Bitcoin's value relies solely on the confidence and willingness of people to attribute worth to it.
This is influenced by many factors including:
* ease of use.
* willingness of people to accept them as payment.
* ease of exchange for other currencies or goods.
* stability of value.
* security and reliability.
* transparency.
* liquidity.
Value is what value is, but it is not just an opinion rather the measure of confidence. It's also subjective.
To a coiner Bitcoin has value. To everyday normal people like my wife it is worth absolutely nothing.

Millions of adopters over time.


It's a fucking plot dimwit. That's how things looked in the mid 90s.


Sound irrelevant?


When it was publicly available it took off. That's what the graph represents. Before the internet was open to the public it's not really relevant. We're talking early 90s. The graph is early 90s.


Many said Microsoft were late to the party and they had to make up lost ground. Incidentally, here's a bit of a flashback for you, this is 1996 where Microsoft had already established Active X and IIS.
Acknowledged as late to the party, and yes IE1 was released in 95. Bear in mind Mosaic was only released in 1993.
If we had to pin a date for the public release of the internet, I would say it was around late 1993, early 1994. Prior to this it was strictly the domain of the .org and the .eu.
So with this in mind, Microsoft wasn't really that far behind.


You mean Bricks and Mortar didn't take up the internet until 1996/7? Amazon started in 1994, which is pretty much the birth of online retail. The growth from there was explosive.

Perhaps you could draw the long bow and consider that someone would rather buy 1 'bit' rather than a fraction of a Bitcoin... but I don't actually see this working.
What is disappointing is with all the things Bitcoin still needs, so much energy is absorbed in debating the units to be used. Nero fiddled while Rome burned.

The problem with any attempt to apply a trend is it assumes that ceteris paribus exists. That in short the price remains constantly under the influence of a limited set of variables over time and all other external factors remain equal.
If you timelapsed the changes in either logarithmic or linear trend lines and animated this into a gif, you'd just see a whole lot of wavy lines fluctuating all over the places which if they even lined up with what has historically happened would be 90% luck and 10% bullshit.
In summary, if you put your faith in charts and graphs to 'predict' the growth of Bitcoin, and ignore what is happening around us in favour of the line that gives you the most jollies, well more power to you.

I think largely because it's an evolving beast that currently doesn't represent a significant amount of money to worry too much about tightening the regulation. As it is, governments are slowly moving towards regulation as we can see in New York City, and the recent policy of the IRS.
As for supporting it, there is no incentive for governments to support Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.


1. By making the whole process consumer friendly.
2. By not making it so that buying into Bitcoin is buying into a political movement. That shit is scary.


They cost money.


The main idea is to transfer money anywhere in the world instantly. The problem exists that there are still too many points of friction for this to be a huge benefit, so effort needs to be worked on here to make this easier.
It is also supposed to be good for merchants because once they've got the customers money they don't have to give it back. I myself am not sure this is a good thing™


1. Make it easier.
2. Take the politics out of it.

Because essentially you're making the government contribute through tax deduction. I really can't be bothered explaining it really, it's shit they should really teach in school.


Now I can see your point here about microdonations in that I certainly helped sponsor the Dogecar, but once again, **the method of payment should not be the determining factor in whether you sponsor / donate** (and there is a difference... essentially donation is an altruistic action that provides no direct benefit, sponsorship does imply some form of benefit).
For instance (and this is an example, not a strawman), would you donate bitcoin to something you didn't believe in simply because they accepted bitcoin?
Likewise, when it comes to crowdfunding, I feel in a lot of ways these can be people targeting low hanging fruit. With Venture Capital, there is checks and balances to ensure firstly the group seeking capital can do what they say, and then that they will follow through.
Many crowdfunded efforts are nothing more than elaborate scams. They end up running off with a lot of money, but because there's no checks and balances in place they can do so worry free.
Again though, we're moving away from my key point. The method of payment should not determine whether you will donate. Likewise you wouldn't eat at a restaurant just because they accept bitcoin, you eat there because you like the food and experience.

I don't think you quite understand how a write off works. In fact, your language is very dismissive in that it implies you think people donate to charities to minimise tax.


And I stand by my original point. You should spread your money to things you believe in, either in your heart or ideologically. The method of receiving said donation shouldn't be a deciding factor.

In programming we call this 'casting', but either way you're just strengthening my argument.


But that is irrelevant because you've shifted the context. The morality of weapon manufacturing is a human construct. The weapons themselves don't give a fuck, because they have no capacity to give a fuck. You've moved the context from the gun existing, to the method the gun was brought into existence. You shifted the question of 'alignment' from the gun to the gun maker.
The original thing we're discussing here is whether technology is 'good' or 'evil'. I stand by the original point that technology is neither, it just exists. What you DO with the technology is both a different context AND a question of human morality, not the morality of the technology.

Let's be honest, this is a big deal. It's a psychological problem, it's an investment problem and it's a confidence problem.
Whilst I have no doubt, many here got in under the current price, it was the meteoric rise to $1000+ levels that helped bitcoin into the mainstream conscience.
A lot of people got interested and bought in around the high tide mark. These people have now suffered incredible losses, and will either continue to wear the loss or simply write bitcoin off and get out.
The biggest issue is the $1k+ pricing was overvalued, and given the evidence, artificially pumped anyway.
So if the price doesn't magically climb, and there's no indication it will, we're looking at a lot of red since November, and that's good for nobody.

I like the state. I like the protection it affords us and the support it gives us. I see and derive benefit from paying taxes. Through voting, I influence the leadership, understanding that my vote is just a drop of water in an ocean made up of drops.
Most importantly, if it wasn't for the state, you motherfuckers would never have existed, because your great grandparents who fought in 2 wars for your actual freedom and actual liberty wouldn't have been around to inseminate your grandmother leading to the chain reaction that resulted in your disrespectful, ignorant teenage ass.

Put the gun in the hand of a criminal it is a device for evil. Put the gun in the hand of someone who has to shoot someone to save the human race... it is a device for good.

Compared to the size of Bitcoin's market cap to Doge's and it looks like a drop in the ocean.
I keep hearing about how the Bitcoin community is so generous, and yet it seems they're more concerned with counting their wallet balances and exchange rates.
Or to put in simple terms, in comparison, Doge has achieved way more exposure and promotion in shorter time with less resources. Of course this doesn't discount what the community has done so far, and kudos to them, but really? Doge is kicking ass in the publicity stakes and we sit around bitching most of the time and pretending alt coins don't exist.

Well I do have a degree in Marketing, so I would hope I learned something.


Let me put it to you in simpler terms. Bitcoin has to be both attractive to the consumer and the vendor. Depending on who has the balance of power in the purchasing relationship dictates who can demand what in the transaction.
You might think as the consumer you have the right to demand things, but there are limits. Demanding a discount for Bitcoin is just going to make vendors think "fuck Bitcoin". Meanwhile consumers don't want to have to be demanding, they just want to buy things.
My recent shopping experiences has seen cash beat Bitcoin everytime anyway. Perhaps you should be asking for price parity not discounts.
Value adding is very important in a situation where all things are equal. If I had the choice of paying with Bitcoin or Amex and the price was the same... I'd take Amex, especially if it was an electrical item. Why? Amex gives me automatic extended warranty and points. It also gives me consumer protection should the retailer be a dick.
What value do I get from Bitcoin? If the retailer threw in extended warranty, free shipping (or free upgrade to express shipping), or a myriad of other ways to increase the value I would be receiving, to me this would be a far bigger incentive to use Bitcoin, since I'm already forfeiting value offered by my Credit Card.

You're 100% right but the community have chosen to be blind to this issue. When MtGox goes it will not be going quietly. It will implode and then supernova with ripples to be felt in Bitcoin for a long time come.
There will be no joy to be felt from the demise of MtGox, no 'great news', it will just be a massive drop in confidence in Bitcoin accompanied by further exchange runs/collapses as people move to protect what they've got and liquidate what they don't want.
Remember, some people bought on Gox for $1200 not so long ago. It's now worth 10% of that and more realistically zero.

Every kind of Visa or MC transaction has a payment classification code attached to it specific to the industry the merchant works in. When a payment processor processes payments, they apply this merchant code at the time of transaction.

So, I have pretty extensive Linux knowledge, and I know my way around VPS pretty well. I'd be interested in assisting the effort to setup full nodes.
But let's be real. A decent full node is going to cost minimum $5 to $6 per month and more likely $10 to $15. The amount of work a current node does would send most low end VPS providers into a spin with the resources it uses, or crawl like a one legged crab.
Still, as I said, I'd be happy to help out setting up nodes on VPS.

@_date: 2014-03-25 13:44:30
I don't know where to start on deconstructing this...
I'll just say this. In order for Bitcoin to rise in value:
1. it needs to be wanted.
2. In order to be wanted it needs to be 'seen'.
3. In order to be seen it needs to be used.
4. In order to be used, you need to buy something with it.
5. To do that, Merchants need to want to accept it.
6. Merchants won't take the time to adapt to accept, unless it is popular.
This might seem like a chicken and egg scenario, but actually it's a cumulative scenario. The more Bitcoin circulates, the more it will grow, and so on.
If you hoard it all away, and keep the bulk of it in the wallets of a very small number of people like now, it will die a slow, boring, insignificant death.
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:16:37


I cannot see how they won't create their own coin.
Google is the power play here. If they adopt Bitcoin, you can forget the fucking moon, Bitcoin is going to the great beyond.
On the other hand, if Google say, hrmmm we think we'll just roll our coin (because that's super hard), the uptake of their coin will pretty much make every other crypto currency obsolete.

@_date: 2014-05-04 02:29:55
Because a few years ago when the US Government cracked down on online gambling quite a few people went to jail.
Bitcoin's anonymity hasn't worked out too well in recent times for people that have had sites that openly allow US citizens to break the law.
Amazingly, spending 20 years in a US jail is an amazing disincentive for the 'big guys' to pursue the US market.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:21:38

226 years ago a bunch of British boats (with guns) rocked up, ascertained the local natives were very little threat, and planted the English flag and said "this is ours".
The world is vastly different now than it was then.
How do you expect to:
1. Find this island?
2. Establish sovereignty?
3. Setup a system of government under said sovereignty?
4. Defend it?
5. Not get laughed at by everyone else on the planet?
The bottom line is you're going to be hard pressed to find a piece of dirt on the planet above sea level where some nation doesn't already consider it part of their sovereign territory. Likewise, you'll have absolutely no means of attaining / occupying / defending this piece of dirt without a fight on your hands.

The reality is it chronically overstates the importance of bitcoin though, and especially 150,000 subscribers of which generally there's never more than 800 ~ 1000 at any one time... this might seem like a big deal, until you look elsewhere on the internet and see some other numbers.
One example is whirlpool.net.au, which is an online community that used to be popular in Australia for discussing Australian issues and broadband internet. So, a niche community in a small market (Australia), and these are the numbers it pulls:
**Whirlpool Membership**
    667,165 registered members
    13,517 visited in past 24 hrs
    1,033 members are online now
    1,171 guests are visiting

Unless you had no faith it was ever going to be that high again. Unless you believed it was time to cut the losses and take what little you have left and run.
People's confidence is rocked in Bitcoin right now. Will it come back? I think so... in time. But it's justifiable that people don't see it that way. It certainly doesn't smell like roses right now.


If it was fucking secret then how come everyone knows this? The real secret is knowing when the lows and highs will be, and how low and how high they will go. If you know this, then you are making money. If you don't, you don't know any fucking secrets, you're just gambling and calling it 'trading'.

The protocol itself is far from unique. There are now many blockchain clones some with superior advantages to Bitcoin, without the carryover of the disastrous legacy these bad companies are leaving in their wake.
It's not just bad management. In many cases it's outright theft and fraud. It's ties to illicit and illegal activity. It's the libertarian leanings of many of its proponents. It's the heavy manipulation of the market coupled with a large chunk of the coins being in the hands of people who stole them.
It's the overall public image, coupled with the fact there are still quite a few 'bad actors' left in the game who derive their income from selling coins and nothing more, who seem to be at the forefront of pushing the technology.
In many ways the biggest threat to Bitcoin is its rotten core. None of this of course has anything to do with the technology, but as I said, the technology is far from unique.

Let me use an example.
In the late 80s I was part of a computer club that had a regular weekly meet up. It was all guys, and we would sit down and talk hardware, software, PCBs... very geeky stuff.
It was a reasonable size community. Probably about 80 members in a small town. Not one woman.
Then one day, the Club President says, "we need to grow the club... what about targeting women? We need more women... we have none! Lets be less guy nerdy and be more welcoming to women!"
It was best summed up by a friend of mine "Why the fuck would a woman want anything to do with this, and if she does, she knows what to expect."

That's such a simplistic view it's hard to give a constructive answer. The bottom line is our society didn't magically appear out of thin air 5/25/125/1000 years ago. It is something that has been forged over tens of thousands of years with so many layers of development.
To simplify it as maintaining existence through violence and coercion really glosses over a number of very major philosophical underpinnings of humanity that have been cultivated over several millennia.

"Bitcoin is a fantastic way of moving money rapidly and anonymously. You can instantly transfer money from point A to point B faster than any other means of doing so.
Terrorists have already had similar through hawala for some time. If they use Bitcoin it's not because Bitcoin exists, they would use hawala if it didn't. They would use toys stuffed with jewels and money if it didn't."

converting twice will always lose more than converting once.
AED -&gt; Rupee... reasonably reliable transfer, only 1 conversion fee/penalty whatever you want to call it. Transfer takes place within 48 hours from most UAE Banks. Safe and Reliable. Cost - 60 AED (around $17 USD).
AED -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Rupee ... Firstly you have to find someone to buy Bitcoins from. Then you have to accept if it's Local Bitcoins you're going to have to find someone selling and then pay a premium. If it's through an international exchange you're going to have to pay some kind of conversion fee. Then you have to initiate the transfer.
On the receiving end the whole process must be reversed. There's a lot of friction there, and I wonder if you'd save that $17 in the wash. I doubt it.
Of course, one business opportunity would be for a middle man to sell the Bitcoins in UAE and buy them back in India, making a killing in the process... and this would be the very activity that attracts regulation.
But then again, why need Bitcoin at all? That's what Hawala is for.

If you were around in the days of BBS and clunky old dial up you'd know that email went viral very quickly.
It was fast, easy and free. Hotmail made it so anyone could be sending emails around the world less than a minute from signing up. It was frictionless.
The only delay email suffered was people onramping to the internet. Nobody ever questioned its utility or whether it would be accepted.

That should tell you something.


Not having cash and only a mobile phone is not something unique to 'millennials'. I can't remember the last time I carried physical cash and don't really see it as an issue not having cash. The cashless society existed before the year 2000 ticked over, at least here in Australia it did.
If they want my donation, I simply ask them if they have a website and I will read, decide, and donate later. If they can't get that together, well, that's not my problem.


No, it's not a strategic move, it's simply that as part of my donations I am eligible for relief on those tax donations. Why not if you can get it?


When I was a young boy in the 1980s, we used to collect door to door for The Red Cross. If someone donated more than $5 they were eligible for a tax deduction so we had to issue them a receipt. It wasn't hard in the 1980s, it shouldn't be hard in 2014. In the cashless society it is a lot easier to do the whole receipting thing.
You're caught up on the 'tax write off'. You do realise if I was trying to save money I'd just not donate in the first place right? Not just donate because it's a 'tax write off'. It's part of the whole donation lifecycle that donations to charities are tax deductible because of the offset of Net Social Cost vs. Benefit.

Governments are a direct result of a functional society. It has been proven throughout the entire history of the human race, that self organised systems eventually give way to hierarchical governance. It is apparently who and what we are. We seem to be programmed this way.


That depends on how you don't want to participate. If you "not participate" by ignoring laws such as "don't rape, don't steal, don't murder" then bad things are going to happen to you.


This is colorizing it with emotion.


Government is a very broad term. So you might have to be a bit more specific.
If you think there's anyway the human race could survive on this planet if we were free to roam the lawless land then well... I have to question how old you are.


This is by definition a straw man.

Wow. You do realise that violence and war comes as a result of breakdown in order, not as a response in building it? Sure there have been times in the history of mankind when we've had to force other cultures into submission, and since you know, we were the good guys, we get to write the rosy story of how all this came to pass... and it's shit... but did you ever stop and think that in tens of thousands of years, it's the best we're ever going to do?

Go look at BTC-e and watch the buy sell orders lists and how quick they change. Such changes at such precision could not be humanly possible.
I myself have a bot that checks the price of alt pairs every minute and will trade at certain prices. Why? I dunno... shits and giggles. I wrote it myself in 3 hours as a bit of a hypothetical.
Does it make money... slowly but then we're not talking about a massive amount being parlayed here. If I were to increase it by a factor of 100 I've always wondered if it would increase the revenue... there's always the law of diminishing returns.

The big problem I see with a lot of self labeled libertarians on this subreddit is they are so into the 'libertarian ethos' they are way out on the fringe and therefore everyone appears as a statist.
Therefore, when you relay back that what they're saying 'sounds like a load of bollocks' they label you a statist.
Point in case taxation on Bitcoin. I'm all for tax minimalisation and less taxation but I do believe it plays a necessary role in society.
To someone who is an extreme socialist I'd be a libertarian. To a libertarian I'm a statist. The reality is like most people I'm kinda happy just floating around the middle.
If you're always looking right, then everything is left. The end result is extremists end up alienating those people they need the most, the majority just trying to get on with life.

That's an interesting question but most definitely PayPal has reporting requirements. If you do over $1000 in transactions you are met with a requirement for a wall of paperwork including US tax forms, even if you're not USA based.
One of our products does a substantial amount of trade through PayPal, and I had my own battle with them during the day, but one thing we have found very good about them is their level of fraud prevention... But getting off track now.

There is no guarantee the product adoption life cycle will happen with Bitcoin. There is no guarantee it will happen with any new product or service.
Personally I think the opportunity to make the leap between early adopters and early majority has passed, or at the very least is rapidly slipping away.
Recent news hadn't helped, but also people not in the early adopter camp are losing or have already lost interest.
I don't believe Bitcoin is dead dead, but the way the last few months have played out, and continue to play out, things don't look great right now.

It does seem to be an initiative wholly supported by BitPay. It's definitely an attempt to own the sphere.
The community is acting as if nobody knew the word 'bit' existed before it was used in Bitcoin.
* a bit of chocolate.
* a bit goes in a horses mouth.
* a bit is obviously used in computing, correctly.
* The word 'bit' is ranked  in the 5000 most common English words. [see here](
* 8/16/32/64 bit consoles.
* 64 bit iPhone 5S.
* already a unit of measure in many applications.
The notion of changing the unit, and dispensing with the decimal place is taken at face value a folly, and if looked at cynically a weak attempt at manipulating the market.

* Dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation.
* As easy to use for Joe Consumer as their current banking facilities.
* Trust is re-established in the network.
How will Bitcoin fail?
* Continued collapse of exchanges.
* Continued stories of users losing their coins to theft.
* Trying to fight the banking industry.
* The Bitcoin Foundation.
* Complexity and poor user friendliness continues.
* Trust level remains about the same as it is now.

Ok, I'm going to try and not be too cynical here but will try to be the voice of reason.
I applaud your spirit in wanting to go it your own and start your own thing. I did this several years ago and have never looked back. The early days were tough, but I did have a big resource of funds to draw upon to pull me through the lean times, and after about 2 years, got to the point where I was making a very nice living.
There's many rewards financially and spiritually to doing your own thing. But be prepared for the following:
1. There will be tough times, especially in the early days.
2. You don't like your shitty job but get ready for shitty clients. In the early days it may not be so easy to say no when they're waving their check book.
3. Reputation is your most important asset. Make sure you're clear and competent about what you're going to do. Work hard, and do not fuck it up. Never blame the client even (and especially) when it is their fault. Suck it up and learn from this. Nobody ever won an argument.
4. Don't restrict yourself to a new, experimental and risky form of payment. Getting paid in business is hard enough, trust me on that. Restricting yourself to Bitcoin just makes it tougher.
5. Hope for the best, plan for the worst, and be prepared to work long hard hours doing whatever you choose to do.
6. Motivation. It comes from within. Question if you will have the motivation to see it through. Many years later you will still need the motivation.
7. Cherish those around you, be patient with them because they are being extremely patient with you.
8. Pay back the faith. Your wife is supporting your ass and your lofty venture. Make sure you never forget this and show appreciation as often as possible.
9. Don't work for free. Ever.
10. Don't commence a job / project / whatever unless you have a deposit first.
Point 4 is the most relevant here. Well done for seeking financial and spiritual independence, just don't pin all your hopes on a method of payment that a fraction of people use.
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:47:02
I will take a leap here and assume you are in the USA, in which case you should first ascertain if you're in one of the 9 states that have common law marriage.
If you're in a Commonwealth country then you are most likely already married under the eyes of the law for all intent and purpose.
Now... That out of the road, it really depends on your motives for getting married. You already have a child and have been together 6 years... If you're still worried about your money then I can only assume you're not really emotionally invested into the relationship and marriage is probably not for you anyway.
At the end of the day though, you say you also have other combined assets, and more importantly a child. Your financial situations are intrinsically linked. There's no getting away from that.
So the upshot might be, it's both probably too late to be worried about this now, and you sound like the unstable one in the relationship.
On the flip side, if you feel genuinely she's making a play for your assets and has no intention of committing to the marriage long term, you would probably be doing yourself, her and the marriage statistics a favour if you didn't proceed.

Ugh this happens.  They rejected one of my apps for the same reason and I own the trademark on it. With so many apps being published reviewers (in India) are very overworked and won't spend very long looking at an app.

I don't really know how to answer this... except to say every month I have automatic payments that **I** setup from my own internet banking to make payments to different accounts from specific accounts, including my Credit Card. These are push transactions. A transaction based on rules I specify.
Perhaps is the Bitcoin narrative there is a different meaning for the term 'push' that I have not come across?

That makes no sense whatsoever. Investment isn't a need, it's a means to an end, the end being the return which is the need.
People invest in Bitcoin because they want profitable returns, not because they need to invest.
Sentiment means so many different things depending on context. For instance, one sentiment right now is Bitcoin is dropping madly, and has been a pretty poor investment for the last year.

For a company that already accepts actual money to accept Bitcoin through BitPay is not helping the Bitcoin ecology one bit except to provide an exit point.
It won't introduce new people to Bitcoin. People get to the checkout and they decide through the payment options available and select the one they have. They are not going to waste time and setup a new payment facility.

* Twitter was huge at 6 years.
* Reddit is 10 years old, at 6 is was fucking huge already. At 6 years had a fuckton more users than Bitcoin does now.
* Instagram is huge, and is barely 4 years old. More people use it than Bitcoin.
* Snapchat is huge and is 4 years old. More people use it than Bitcoin.
There's some examples.

We're not exactly seeing a shortage of Bitcoin on exchanges right now, if anything, the falling price indicates the opposite, i.e. supply outstrips demand.
All a mass loss of coins does is further destabilizes confidence in Bitcoin, which puts negative pressure on the price. It is not a good thing. There is no silver lining. This is not good for Bitcoin.

Every couple of months in our suburb the local council organises a roadside pickup. What this means is you can put anything you no longer want or need on the road side, and they will send a truck around to collect and dump it for you. This is excellent for things like old microwave ovens, or other crap that does not work.
So what happens next?
People put their unwanted trash on the roadside a couple of days before the nominated day. It is estimated between **70 to 80%** of this unwanted trash is collected by pickers and scavengers.
Moral of the story? One person's trash is another person's treasure. Everyone values something differently.

The price shifted around +/- 5% within an hour today. That's volatile enough. That's what Gabe was talking about.
The other issue is it's a long time between profits. Basically a game goes for 3 years relying on a helping hand from the publisher and everyone says their fucking prayers as it goes to Gold, because that's when the money is made... or more often... lost.

Generally this is more to do with changing gender roles over time.
When I grew up my parents only had one bank account and my father would be the one who signed the cheques. They had one credit card, and it was in Dad's name. It was basically the gender role of the patriarch at the time to manage the finances.
As society has evolved, women have become more empowered to take on more things that were once considered a gender role. My mother now has a credit card, much to my father's disgust (perhaps mock disgust) and she loves the freedom of having it. She talks about having it all the time.
Meanwhile my other half has had a credit card all her life. She thinks it's both "cute and weird" how my mother talks about her credit card, but at least she she has one! Her mother is still not 'allowed' one.
Bitcoin doesn't face these social issues. It came to life in a much more gender equitable world.

This is not what 'distributed' means in the networking sense.
Distributed means multiple nodes under taking multiple tasks with an element of redundancy built in. What you might have meant was decentralized. In this case, the SMTP server authenticates / permits / controls what traffic onboards onto the email network through it.

None of this is in dispute, however, it needs to be put in perspective of total population, GDP and distribution of wealth.
* With such a skewed distribution of wealth, the notion India has more millionaires is irrelevant and if anything works against Bitcoin uptake. With such a high concentration of wealth in such a small percentage of the population there is nothing in this statistic that will drive uptake.
* Overseas remittances is certainly something that I think is a positive factor, but bear in mind this needs conversion at both ends from fiat-&gt;BTC-&gt;fiat. This is not at all frictionless and introduces logistical, bureaucratical and technological hurdles into the mix.
* The Banking bureaucracy just adds to the friction in the conversion. We see enough of it in less bureaucratic markets, why will India be 'better'?

Nobody. Not even KnC who are reportedly one of the good guys.
The bottom line is any miner you buy today is going to have a very limited lifespan before it reaches zero (and negative) returns. Maybe a few months if you're lucky.
Again, depending on luck, you might recover your investment, but given the glut of hashing power we're experiencing right now, I severely doubt it.
There's a very good analysis tool here:
Mining is for enthusiasts, idiots, or people willing to shell out big now and willing to accept they're entering into a race to ROI and maybe, and I mean maybe, make a profit.

I've thought hard about this and I have decided to stock up on some Peercoin. The reasons for this I feel are:
1. When a lot of hardware become pointless to mine BTC due to difficulty people will switch to Peercoin boosting its popularity (maybe).
2. The proof of stake is an interesting concept.
3. It's in the mix and I believe has reached a significant enough capitalisation to persist long term.
So... I've invested in and have switched a miner over to it for a while.
If it works out... fantastic. If not... no big deal.
Edit: I might add I'm talking about a minimum 3 year deal here. I don't expect Peercoin to boom overnight to Bitcoin levels, but I am thinking on 3 years it could emerge as a strong coin contender.

Well, to put it mildly, ASIC will blow conventional 'GPU' mining out of the water.
One $200 ASIC miner running at 50 watts can pull 5 GHps, that's the equivalent of about 8-10 ($2500 - $3000) high end GPU cards sucking enough power to cause brownouts.

@_date: 2013-04-23 21:52:18
It depends on why you want to get 'in'?
If you want to get in to make money, and make money properly, then you should probably sit by with the other hundred thousand or so speculators and wait (hope) to buy in when the current market crashes again. Then you can take the punt that it will recover, sell at a profit, rinse and repeat.
The problem with this strategy is the scale of the number of people doing this. Everytime Bitcoin goes up, it brings in new vultures waiting for it to go down, such that in theory, over time these buy walls will prevent sharp drops reducing profit.
Better ways to make money out of Bitcoin:
* Start a Bitcoin betting site or casino.
* Start your own bitcoin brokerage and just live off the skim.
* Sell ASIC miners.
Ways you might struggle to make money out of Bitcoin:
* attempt to smash and grab trade.
* small scale mine

If you want Bitcoin to be accepted as a currency then you need to accept the only thing that makes it a currency is the belief it can be traded.
If people don't believe in it, then it will go nowhere, and NO I don't think it has attained the critical mass yet to go somewhere.
If you want to see a real world paper example of what happens when people lose faith in a currency, look at Zimbabwe.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:42:58
It's very difficult to speculate. China helped keep Bitcoin buoyant through a number of possible turbulent periods the past 2 months.
One thing the market did by pumping the price up though was draw a lot of attention, sell a lot of miners, and motivate a lot of people to join the movement.
What happens in the fallout remains to be seen, but it will definitely be an encouraging sign for other governments on how easy it is to stop.

Yes they create money through 'loans' but they must have money to loan in the first place. At least that's how banks work over here.

It all depends on the hashing power of the eruptors. The pi doesn't do the hashing it just runs the mining software that fetches the blocks and passes them along to the eruptors.

* Doubles as a heater in the cooler months.
* Handcrafted and Bespoke. Took 6 months to manufacture and deliver.
* Actually exists and is mining now.
* Should pay for itself sometime in the next 3 years.
* Prevents unwanted narcolepsy through it's patented 'always humming' technology.
* Reasonably good at stopping paper blowing off desk.
* Probably some other good things going for it, but as I wanted to get this bad boy mining as quick as possible, I didn't have time to read the tiny single page pamphlet included in the huge box it shipped in.
Only serious offers accepted though.
Edit: I realise that people might doubt the authenticity of my claims so here is an [actual picture]( of the unit in operation.

I wouldn't be banking on India at all. They might have the highest number of millionaires in the world, but they far and away have the largest number of people in the world with not a rupee to their name.
If you look at their GDP per capita it is VERY LOW. They are ranked 139th in the world, compared to China (rank 87), Cyprus (rank 28th) and USA (rank 10), India's buying power doesn't even rate on the scale.
Likewise their distribution of wealth is pitiful with 68.2% of the population (approx 2/3rds) living on less than $2USD per day.
Quite simply, this is not the rocket ship you are looking for.

I think the implied 'list of bitcoin buyers' just means a flag to say that this person transacts these kinds of transactions and to not automatically flag the transaction as suspicious for this reason. It still might get flagged for other reasons.

I'm a fence sitter. I'm neither a speculator and I wouldn't classify myself as a believer.
More to the point, I truly believe the benefits of being right largely outweigh the costs of being wrong. On the other hand, that's because I don't have my life's savings or a lifetime of debt buried in Bitcoin.
I think as a technology and a payment system, it shows a lot of promise. However, the gaps between where it is now and where it needs to be are going largely ignored because ZOMG!! TO THE MOON!. Perhaps we need more focus on ZOMG!! TO THE CASH REGISTER!! to get some motivation to plug these gaps.
Some people say a Bitcoin one day will be worth $100,000 USD. They might be right. They might be wrong. But either way I think you're foolish if you don't have at least 1 Bitcoin. The only problem with this of course is the rising value of Bitcoin is counterproductive to it becoming a currency useful for trading.

No problem. I don't regret getting into mining myself but I fall somewhere into the enthusiast or idiot category, and I didn't drop that much of an outlay on my rigs. Essentially though it's worthless now, but I'll keep it running for the time being.
What's scary from a mining perspective is just how much GHS is coming online over December and January. Most of these machines will not make ROI.

If you buy one bitcoin at 250 USD you will have one bitcoin.
If you buy one Jalapeno at 250 USD you will have one Jalapeno and no bitcoins.
FWIW, I have a Jalapeno and it's currently making me about ~0.01 BTC per day at current rate. That means in ~125 (or so but probably longer) days you will have 1 BTC (maybe) and 1 Jalapeno.
if Bitcoins are are worth $250 USD still in 4 months, you would be happy, as you've covered your loss and still have a Jalapeno. If it's worth $500 USD, you have doubled your investment, it they are worth $125 you're still behind and chasing the dragon.
At the end of the day though... 4 months to break even (maybe) and make a 'whopping' $250 is ridiculously slow.
Excuse the ramblings, but I have a Jalapeno not to make money but just because I am interested in Bitcoin. I don't think there's any other reason for owning one. They're not going to make you rich, and given the volatility of BTC balanced with the rising difficulty, I question you'd ever be in a position to make your money back if you don't start mining with it ASAP.

Well, right now, my bank in Australia provides me services that enable my company to run. It's something I'm very wary of to the point where I am starting to wonder if I ever go to sell my coins whether it will be problematic for the rest of my business.
I've already got another online business that provides services to people overseas (outside of Australia) and this has been such a headache at tax time that I'm almost considering walking away from it.
You only have to see the dramas coinjar.io faced with their bank in Australia to know there's complications ahead.
The irony is that these complications may force me down the shady route in converting coins to cash as opposed to doing everything above board and documented.

I would say a lot depends on the next few months whether Bitcoin will break its previous high. Really, the community needs to dig deep and focus on moving Bitcoin ahead as a transaction instrument, instead of as a paper stock.
If it can achieve this, I think Bitcoin will smash any previous high in a very short amount of time.
If the community are still prattling on about the price and trading of Bitcoin in 6 months and still ignoring the major shortcomings, then I will put this as nicely as possible... Bitcoin is fucked.

It doesn't matter what Bitcoin is. At $2 a day, it isn't getting bought.
To be clear over the past 10 years I have done three research projects for organisations looking at India. All these companies see is the growing (out of control!) population, do some crappy math and think it's the road to riches.
It's not. There is widespread poverty, high levels of corruption, complete lack of infrastructure and the value of a human life is almost worthless. 70% of the population live in absolute poverty. Of the remaining 30%, 90% of these live in conditions that would shock us by Western standards.
What remains, the 10% of the 30%, is about 50 million people that actually have the wealth and resources equivalent to the west, with the attitudes and spending power that we're accustomed to. That's 1/6th of the population of the USA. That's what you're dealing with.
This whole India is the next global superpower is a myth. The idea that India could cause any kind of stimulus to the Bitcoin economy is an even bigger myth.

One of two things will happen.
1. Transaction fees will be lucrative enough to support mining and miners will continue to mine. Probably not the case right now though, but early days.
2. Miners will flee to another altcoin that they can mine with their equipment. Greatly reducing the mining power of the network.
The big issue lies in point 1. Bitcoin needs to be transacted in high volume and velocity to support the current hash rate of the network without mining rewards.
The question is will Bitcoin be worth mining up to the point where it can no longer be mined or will the enthusiasm drop off beforehand in favour of possibly another alt-coin?
Hopefully Bitcoin has more than enough momentum that when the tip occurs there's enough transacting going on to keep the miners in the game. They are after all the backbone of the network.

Losing their credit cards and a few fraudulent transactions which they would be reimbursed for is an inconvenience.

I don't think we'll ever see the hash rate significantly drop, if at all. People mining now will still be mining out of fun or hope that they can eek some profitability back out of it.
The big question is someone still going to drop $5k on a KNC Miner today? Or the latest BFL mincer? I suspect it would be a foolish waste of money.
However, if the value can increase and some small profitability can return to the mining game, we might see a plateau of hashrate and much smaller growth than the meteoric rise we've seen. All speculation of course.

I used to work in real estate with people who thought the same about property prices, despite all evidence being to the contrary.

In Australia if you buy off an Australian site with BTC you still have to pay GST (goods and services tax)

Going to take a while to feed those 96,000 coins through the tumbler, but I wouldn't be surprised if they've started, or are just working on the bot now.

I think that was his point entirely. He is relatively mature and tech savvy and he doesn't understand it to the point where he is comfortable with it.
If Bitcoin is to succeed it needs mainstream traction, and that is never going to happen if the mainstream do not understand it enough to be comfortable with it.

You might be right, you might be crazy, but this is the reason why I will always keep at least 1 BTC.
If you're right... WooH00!
If not... no big deal.

Well, according to some the true value of a single bitcoin is $100,000. I'm not sure if this will ever happen, but I have a few bitcoins that I mined... and I'll be hanging onto them.
If the value of a bitcoin gets to $100,000 I'll be laughing. If it never does, I'm no worse off than I am now.
Is it too late? Well, I think there's a case where you could have made a lot of money that's passed us all by... but again, you're no worse off than you are now.
I ordered a small BFL miner. If it ever shows up and I start mining with it, and I accumulate a few more bitcoins... then I'll be happy.
If none of this comes to fruition, I'm no worse off than I am now.
Now... if I were to go to the bank and borrow $30,000 to buy bitcoins at the current price in the hope it goes to $260 and make $30,000 like that... if it happens I'd be laughing. If it didn't happen however, I would be a LOT worse off than I am now.
I know not one single word I have said above has answered your question, but perhaps it gives you something to think about regarding your own personal situation and whether you should get into Bitcoin.

I'm not cashing out at $1k. Not $5k. Not $10k.
At first I thought... this has got to be a joke. Then I thought... this has got to be a bubble. Then I thought... what the fuck is going on here?
And now Bitcoin is getting media attention, legitimacy, and people talking about it. It is fast reaching the tipping point. Every day someone new joins the Bitcoin masses.
There are ever only going to be 21 Million Bitcoins, and I think we can immediately write 10% of these off as forever lost. So with less than 20 Million coins and an Internet population of 2.5 Billion people... that's some serious scarcity.
If Bitcoin only achieves 1% of penetration then that is 1 coin per internet user. Well... I have more than one coin and so do a lot of other people. If it achieve more than this, then it literally is too the moon because the value will skyrocket.
So how much is it worth? Both nothing and a shitload. It's that period now where we wait and see whether it gains traction or it comes crashing back to Earth.
A year ago I was certain it would come crashing back to Earth. Now... I am not so sure. A year ago I laughed, very fucking hard, at people who said the value of a single Bitcoin is $100,000... now I am not so sure.
At the end of the day... we'll just have to wait and see... but it's worth buying at least 1 Bitcoin just in case right?

Then he probably has PR which he applied for long in advance. It's not something you can just click your fingers and do.

I expect if a warrant is furnished they'd happily supply the logs than take the fall for you. I also expect this would apply to EVERY VPN provider, at least those that aren't run from someone's bedroom.

Well, internal/external lets call it a breach not a hack. Not privy to the details I cannot make any claim it was an inside job. What convinces you it was?


Hrmmm, well it's not like Credit Cards are at a standstill. Many Credit Cards now have 2FA for purchases or automatic blocks on suspicious transactions. Also these kind of incidents are covered at many levels by insurance.
It's not going to collapse anytime soon, nor is it a 'static' technology.


As I said, it's not a static target. Credit Card issuers are constantly working to make their platform more secure.


And yet everyday I login and I read stories about people getting their funds raided from their Bitcoin wallets.
The bottom line is whilst I believe in Bitcoin as a transactional tool, the Target story is irrelevant.

As long as this is a choice I see no problem with it. I can't help you out with the tax laws in your area sorry, or a Spanish translation site for Bitcoin.
If it's not a choice however, then I feel that this is just plain wrong. People work to earn money to put food on the table. Paying them in a currency that they will need to work out how to convert to cash is just adding another complication to their lives.
