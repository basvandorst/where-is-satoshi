Na I'm with him on that one.  
I appreciate what he did, I read the book about it, I know he's got talent and he's a great mind.  
When he talks about cryptocurrencies though, I don't agree with most of what he says.

You obviously don't get my point. 
It's about propaganda not correct information.

It's just that bitcoin has always dropped bigtime after a new high so maybe not 5k but probably 8-10k.  
If it won't, that's okay too for me.

It takes (max.) an hour of not fucking up while properly setting up the hardware wallet and then a lifetime of not handing someone the paper with your key backup. People surely should find a way to safely hide a piece of paper.

Actually IT guy here aswell, **disclaimer: this is my knowingly radical formulated opinion.** 
Either the user is able to follow this step by step manual:  [ or he/she is probaly a 50+ year old who's gotton into this because of his/her (grand-)children, who atleast then should be able to follow this manual FOR them.
If both of these groups are unable to follow this, congrats we've found two DAUs.   
In that case yeah, they should really leave it on CB because they will not only screw up securing their coins, they will also screw up paying anyone with them and will most likely only use it as a speculative asset in the first place.
So basically there are two groups here:
* group a) who's going to learn how to secure it's coins and actually uses them someday
* group b) the group I don't care about which is going to loose it's coins one day
Once you stop learning (and this is all about learning something once for like an hour), you start dying and I don't care what dying people do with their money.

Oh I told my representative, I even told my city, we told everybody, we were on the streets - multiple 100 thousand people, we gathered 5 million voices in a petition. 
We are still trying, we won't give up - but they don't seem to care.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:41:06
Corrected: That they shouldn't try to. 
With all the shit they're pulling of at the moment (copyright law/upload filter, NetzDG, fake news law proposal from macron in france,...) I don't see why they won't try to pull that shit of aswell. 
They don't know that they won't succeed, but they will try their best.

Dude that's worth more then a thousand Bucks at the moment, buy him a Trezor and explain it to him if he can't figure it out by himself.
Don't start using exchanges as Banks again, it's not 2012 - we do have easy to use and secure key-storage devices!

Seriously? If you don't know how to do it fucking learn it, it takes like 3 google searches!

Bullshit, just because it's not an investment that returns money doesn't mean it's dumb. If he's a car guy and he has fun driving it then so what? If it's his dream car then so what?
Maybe he even was smart and bought it used, maybe not - either way there are things that are way more retarded because they are of no benefit to life. Gambling, 8k TVs, gold plated edibles, buying that 1 million dollar app.
A 5 seater car, even if it's a sports car, is atleast somewhat reasonable.

Clearly it is a benefit to his life assuming the example of him being a car guy and it being his dream car because it makes him happy.
Yes it is relevant because what you did by saying "about the dumbest thing you can do with you $$" is literally that, comparing it to other things.
"Lose you money", dude the money is not lost, it is in the car, the tool that makes this guy have fun. If all you care about is money you have some serious issues with your mindset because at the end of the day money is just that, money - there's literally no benefit in having a lot of money if you don't spend it from time to time to make yourself happy. And who are we to judge what makes someone else happy?

Depends. How efficient have the on chain tx's gotten, how many on chain tx's are even happening regarding 2nd/3rd/4th layer solutions, ...
What I want so say is that the block size will be optimized not by using the technical standard as a reference. The block size ( IMO obviously ) should be kept as close to the bare minimum to have a predictable and working fee market on layer 1.
But again, that's just my thought and I am neither a protocol developer nor a miner.

The Telekom basically has a monopoly on broadband/internet expansion which is why they don't really give a fuck about most city's and even in big city's like Frankfurt or Berlin it's rather rare to have more then 25 mbit/s. 
Besides that it was more of a joke and I hope this will change.

I mean, if you have the money and the contacts it's not really hard to figure out. Most cars from manufacturers that have a name in the industry ( Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, ... ) and that only sell in a limited quantity like 500, 100 or less will eventually rise in price, some of them even double in price after only a year. Then there are also classics like the Enzo which steadily rise in price because of there historic value.

There is literally no point in having a single channel open that has 99% of the capacity of the network. It won't benefit the entity that opened it and it won't harm the rest of the network because it's just additional to what already existed before.
