Really sorry if I'm whooshing here, but just in case, or for anyone who doesn't know (we're not all native English speakers)... it's a pun.
"gaining currency" is a phrase that can be used in any context to mean "gaining acceptance".


Here it's used to talk about an actual currency, so you have a pun. Also, since newspaper-style headlines often omit articles (a/the), you can interpret "is gaining currency" as "is a gaining currency", i.e. "is a currency that is on the rise (in some sense)", making for a third layer of punniness. 
Headline writers can't resist that much pun ;p

Chest passwords:
1. Only a genius can unlock this chest. -&gt; A GENIUS (ho ho ho)
2. I have worthless coins that are useful -&gt; [TESTNET](
3. When did Satoshi's fortune start? -&gt; [1/3/2009](
4. For my associates to enter, do not shut me. -&gt; PORT 8333 (mentioned in the provided source)
5. I look like the beginning of a hypercube. -&gt; DOT (I had to use a hint on this one. Tried "point" and other things)
6. For the 3rd key part you must undestand the beginnings: Xena answered: bitcoins made her victorious. Nice. -&gt; XabmhvN (first letters)
Key parts in their correct order: 
1. The first part of the key is worth 5000. -&gt; 5K (examine private keys and this should be fairly obvious, most start with 5K or 5J etc)
2. This chest contains the second key part: 9oYnwjj (given)
3. For the 3rd key part you must undestand the beginnings:
Xena anwered: bitcoins made her victorious. Nice. -&gt; XabmhvN
4. The middle key part:
 -&gt; K2c7catHRKB (for this you have to realize, by inspection with the given parts, that the lines below represent the case, lower or upper, of the given letters. They're required to ensure that you use 'cat' in the key and not 'CAT')
5. "dot" is the 5th part of the key. (given)
6. This chest contains another part of the key:
 -&gt; n6i9tEncxY (again, tEn because of the below lines)
7. The last part of the key is: zhkQNvFyWzE (given)
Put them together in that order and it's solved!

Thank you very much for the challenge (and the coins)! :)

I solved that too, but... now at a brick wall...

Got to France, but didn't think about using satellite view... arghhhh

First half of the private key probably? And the second half is in the other place...
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:52:45
Got it...! ...
[Edit: Solutions incoming, hold on while I type them up :)]

I'm less concerned about the selling and more about the hacking. If this thing takes off, much of that power will have gone straight into the hands of people who would steal other people's coins straight from their poorly-secured wallets. From the corrupt to the corrupt; no great improvement.
Protect your coins! For the good of the land!
