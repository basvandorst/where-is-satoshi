There are some known issues with Firefox that I have to fix
To avoid the reload error press "enter" in the send payment, don't press the button
I haven't heard of this receive field issue but will look into it when I test with Firefox

Open source links here: 
On the Y'alls Slack we are working on a deployable Y'alls that anyone can run but more help is needed there to build that out

Here is a guide to create a micropayment paywall : 
Here is my library that I build my LND stuff off of:  - it is MIT licensed - I also have been working on a LND based MacOS wallet in Swift, also MIT licensed: 
I also forked this project to support on-chain payments  -  also MIT licensed

Heya,  and  are my test sites for the Lightning Network
I noticed there was a lot of increased database load and it was causing some errors. I've increased the database capacity limits, hopefully the errors should go away.
If you go to  you can also check out some wallets to test with to try out Lightning transactions.

You can pay to another user but they need to create a payment request
It will route as necessary, you can view htlc.me's network connectivity by clicking on "network directory" and then scrolling down to "network graph"

If you are using Eclair Android they don't support receiving payments  yet

I haven't done benchmarks yet but it doesn't seem to be under much load with this traffic level

htlc.me is a demonstration of a custodial wallet, like an exchange
This means that the user account balances are kept in a database and then settlement outside of the system is handled by the Lightning network

I'm not sure how Eclair's setup works, but I think the problem should be reported to them
If you can't find a path to Yalls.org you can click on the QR code button next to the payment request. This will show a "peer QR" which you can scan to create a channel directly
The Lightning test network is still pretty small and loosely connected so some manual channel creation is a good option

Yalls.org runs LND on a 1gb memory, 25gb ssd, 1 cpu VPS - it is currently doing around 1000 transactions per hour

Only Eclair Desktop can receive payments, Eclair Android can't yet

Hi - author of Yalls.org here, thanks for trying it out!
Y'alls is a test service I made so people and wallet developers can try out the Lightning Network on testnet
1. Yalls.org doesn't know who sent a payment - it just knows that an invoice was paid. It creates an invoice/payment-request, gives it to you, you pay the invoice, send the paid invoice id to the server, which checks that it is paid, and then returns the article.
2. There is no way for there to be a blockchain explorer for LN because all of this is happening privately and isn't shared globally, there's no global record that you made the payment

Hi, I am the author of the HTLC.me custodial testnet wallet
This is a shared web wallet so you don't have any channels. It uses a backing LND node which will make or receive payments on your behalf and then adjust your balance accordingly 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:38:26
The invoice uses BOLT 11, the encoding is based on Bech32 from Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell 
LND has a decodepayreq method in its API/CLI / invoice decoding implementation from LND here: 
You can also use  which is another Lightning Network Web-App I made and that will show you a visual preview of the amount and payment description

That would be the idea. It is a web wallet so if you want to be sure to control your own coins you should be using a desktop wallet. 
This type of wallet may be useful for small payments like with yalls.org where you only need to keep a few dollars around.

HTLC.me is a test of creating a custodial wallet that is similar to something like Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:01:19
Currently there is no support in the wallet for on-chain transactions or addresses, it is LN-only
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:13:32
The go files are not meant to be run standalone, if you want to decode an individual request you should follow the install instructions, build the entire project, then use the lncli tool or GRPC API to use the decodepayreq API
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:11:26
If you run LND directly or through a desktop app:  then you control your own keys/coins. LND supports either the btcd full node or SPV. There is currently no support for Bitcoin Core but that should be possible in the future.
