the english equivalent of "schadenfreude" should be "failporn"
people who have wanted to see bitcoin star in a failporn are getting annoying...

Have there been any officials named to the Honduras team?

I personally think the name "bitsies" is awesome!  It will definitely be something that a parent is comfortable giving to their child, or a grandparent can easily understand.  A simple name is very important!

Hello, my name is Chris Bates.  I have been working extremely hard to help bring digital currency to the masses.  I helped promote Marinecoin, and it was far from a scam.  The community was destroyed by accusations and the project fell apart.  There is a huge difference.  I am seeing a trend.

Tribal Impact is planning a decentralized application to help non-profits track their impact, and keep long-term engagement with their donors.  The project looks to have a dynamic graphic user interface based blockchain to function as the foundation for the "impact tracker".  In addition to the encrypted file-sharing, the goal of the impact tracker is to be able to show a donation from "start to impact".

The team has already accomplished a ton, and helping get them funding will get the platform to the global scale.  Having a specific token that is controlled by the Factom creates the necessary control environment to make sure the platform gets off the ground.  Bitcoin is too volatile.
