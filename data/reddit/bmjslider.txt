I'm pretty sure that's actually what up voting and down voting is for...
You like a comment, upvote, you dislike a comment, downvote...
Seems pretty straightforward. Don't think you can call people children for you having the unpopular opinion...

I have an issue with OP's content. It's stupid.

So the CEO should only tweet favorably about 3 out of the 4 coins they support? If it's that dreaded 4th, BCH, he must go radio silence or else he's the devil? I think we're reaching here just a little bit...

Hmmm, but I just downvoted you for disagreeing with you. Am I using the internet wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:48:25
Shit. Reddit is ruined now. =\
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:05:22
No, you're right. CEO's should definitely only support 75% of what their company does. They should always hate that other 25%. It just makes sense.

Does Blizzard stating that real world trading of WoW gold is against the rules and bans accounts that they catch doing it protect them from their currency becoming taxable?
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:46:31
I'm on mobile so it's tough to point out the single paragraph that I wish to reply to, but Blizzard did indeed try to allow players to monetize off of Diablo 3 with a "real world auction house." While it served it's purpose, there was major backlash from the community who hated having pay to win aspects introduced into the game and Blizzard was forced to choose between taking a cut from each real world trade or pleasing the community, and they went with the latter.
