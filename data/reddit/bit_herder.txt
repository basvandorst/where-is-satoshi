yeah this is as interesting as reading an article about Netscape not accepting bitcoin. Irrelevant.

if I know etching (and I do), its blank =D

as a person who ran several mpos pools, I can assure you that the max 2% that people are willing to part with to mine at your pool will quickly get eaten up by server costs. Maybe now that ec2 has halved thier pricing there will be a little bit of money in it, but I (and my fellow pool admin) have made MUCH more money mining.
Also, it takes up a LOT of your time that if you are a developer or an admin you could be billing for. If you are doing it for fun, go for it. If you are doing it to get rich, id reconsider. 
Maybe you have a better plan than we did, just sharing my experience.

swap is virtual memory space on disk. Think "windows page file". If you are swapping out memory to disk, likely things are not ideal (at least now in 2014)

yes MPOS is software for running pools - its the most popular one as far as I am awa
coin switching can be done via a proxy like haproxy. It does have 2FA built in and an active community - its open source so its well audited and has a decent track record. 
Even if you own the hardware you have to pay normally sizeable co-location costs (peering, power, backups, etc). Even with that beefy server if you get popular you will outgrow it. Also, disaster recovery, etc need to be considered especially if you are in a traditional (non-webscale) infrastructure, which it sounds like you are. Remember, it takes time to order and rack new hardware. If you go down, even for a few hours, you will lose miners in DROVES. During the doge run-up I saw a lot of pools fail with "be right back, buying more hardware!" and then just close shop because they were down too long. 
You might consider amazon web services as an adjunct to your database server, they have a product that allows you to hook your AWS instances up to your traditional DB/backend/whatever. That will give you some webscale. 
As a server admin for nigh 15 years now I can tell you you want to solve these problems on the front end, not after launch. Best of luck, if you have any questions feel free to PM me.
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:43:31
good luck to you - I just hope you are factoring in all the costs. Server costs grow as your pool grows - you didn't really address that in your response, so I hope you consider it. we were paying around 1K per month to AWS when doge was growing quickly. We had a fairly large pool (at the time)... and we were hardly covering it with fees. Add in some software bugs in MPOS, throw in a little market instability, and you are quickly running at a loss. 
I'm certainly glad someone is trying to develop better pool software, you certainly seem to have some good features on the list.

hes probably not been following and ran into an actual usage issue. Lets not pretend having hours to confirm your transactions doesn't pose a problem for usage. 
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:56:04
nah, but you do have to negotiate and be wary. If you buy gold coins, the price is very well known (you can look it up at any time on the internet) and then negotiate from there. Jewelry and scrap are a bit harder to deal with. 
Still, that wasn't the question, it was "oh hey i have no idea where to even sell this silly gold stuff I have" which is simply silly.
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:34:49
you go to literally any pawn shop and get cash for it 24/7.
i like bitcoin but gold is just fine. this is a silly conversation.
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:25:33
there’s a shitload wrong here but i’ll start with the most obvious as a metalsmith. gold doesn’t tarnish. 
ps i like bitcoin, but cmon
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:48:36
you don't need a laser engraver to do this. Some P&amp;P blue, copper bronze or brass, and some radio shack etching mordant and you can do this yourself easily. Or I'll happily do it for you for .4 btc in any size you want with a nice patina and a jump ring and protective coating =D

@_date: 2013-06-12 13:35:56
no, they have $300 of mine tied up for 17 hours and now have taken down the Q&amp;A section of their site in addition to being non-responsive to emails. Never using this service again. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:31:59
in what way is this a "good job"?
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:44:05
awesome! If you could just get to my transaction now that would be ducky! 
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:03:22
has anyone actually had an issue resolved? 1 person? THey say they are "working through issues" but I don't think anyone is getting their money. 
I am about to submit a refund request with zipzap
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:51:40
you can totally do this in metal the same way you etch PCBs. See my comment a few lines up.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:39:00
no, we can't. that subreddit has virtually nothing in it, and this is a large issue for the community. It needs exposure. If you dont like seeing the posts - sorry. I am a sysadmin and have been at several companies that support thousands of transactions per day, and if we handled anything so poorly, we would be out of business. I am also currently out $300 with nothing but a copypasta response and a bunch of BS to show for it. If it were your money you would feel differently, im sure. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:27:32
the transaction your team was asking about was a successful transaction, not a problematic one. Everyone that asked about a problematic transaction gets "submit a support ticket" then one guy says he got a transaction thru and your support rep requests details. 
here's the post
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:53:43
may I ask how much and was it to mt gox or wallet?
@_date: 2013-06-13 13:59:12
they aren't manually doing anything that we have seen. Nobody in 36 hours has reported one single transaction resolved via their service dept, either here or on bitcointalk forum. 
They claim transactions are being retried both manually and automatically, but I have yet to see anyone say YESSSS i got my funds, and were not charged a fee. I've emailed support (several times), emailed the owner, PM'd the rep both here on reddit and on bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:08:06
oh, they are still happy to take your cash however
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:40:04
but you would expect to see ONE. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:47:52
I suggest before you trust your money to these folks you read up on their support forum
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:14:40
IMHO it would be silly to trust your money with them ATM.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:24:19
they need to stop taking money until they figure this out. Its ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:02:13
no you aren't. You aren't reprocessing failed transactions, we know that. From posts on bitcointalk you are requesting details on transactions that actually went thru today, leading me to suspect you still have no idea what's even broken, much less an eta, much less actually getting us our money. 
Stop stalling and BSing. Its obvious at this point. 
Folks, just request a refund from zipzap and forget this company.... they certainly have forgotten about you.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:13:21
seems like small transactions directly to wallet are all thats making it thru. Maybe if the company would actually tell us what was going on we woudn't have to play detective. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:58:03
how about not taking any more cash until you resolve the tickets in your queue? Wouldn't that help? 
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:53:25
just got this from zipzap... if anybody wants to jump ship they will issue a refund. 
We are aware that BitInstant is experiencing processing delays. They are working on the issues now and we are in regular touch with them. Your funds are safe and all orders will be processed however if you would prefer a cash refund, please let us know and we will refund your payment in full. Attached are the forms that we need to you to complete so we can process your refund request.
Once you have returned the completed forms, we process your refund within 5-7 business days.
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:56:25
same BS response to every thread. I guess "we are still accepting money because we like money" wouldn't go over well. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:23:20
they tell you to log a support ticket, which sends you copypasta BS. Meanwhile, they are still taking money. DO NOT USE BITINSTANT should be on at the top of as a PSA. It's broken (well, except for the taking your cash part... that works ok)
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:46:06
you can get a refund from zipzap, the processor. I am doing that now. they are very friendly. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:35:18
well lets see
- over 20 hours from when problems started to ANY acknowledgement of issues
- users get no support, just copypasta response
- transfers don't work, yet they continue to accept funds
There's "smooth path" and "complete and utter failure of the service with zero support". This is of the second variety. 
To my knowledge, not one issue has been resolved since the site went live. People have hundreds of dollars tied up in a service that isnt providing the service it purports to provide. So yeah, people are pissed off. If you dont understand that, I don't know what to say to you. If you had $300 sitting in limbo, im sure you would feel differently.
