Oh, you have the choice to use escrow if you want to. Unless the merchant doesn't, or uses a different one than the one you wish to use, or many other things that BTC does wrong like not being an actual useable currency.


Accepting CC is as easy as using one of the many payment processing options that already exist. Most banks even provide their own. I could literally set up a webpage in half a minute with a text field for you to enter your CC number and CVC and a submit button.

So let me get this straight
If you want some semblant of customer protection with bitcoin you need:
1) specific wallet clients that allow multisig arbitration  
2) A list of arbitrators you trust, hopefully having one in common with the other party in the transaction  
3) paying fees twice (wallet to escrow, escrow to wallet) or just wait days for the transaction to process if it ever does.  
4) close your eyes and hope for the best.  
5) and that's just to prevent one business for taking your money and running away with it, you still haven't achieved to make bitcoin anything remotely customer-friendly. Other commonly accepted customer protection systems (like 15 days to return online purchases) will require even more steps
now let's compare to good ol' evil statist fiat money:
1) own a valid CC

Yes, I keep hearing about how bitcoin is actually super secure even though people are getting their bitcoins hacked left and right, and i'm like "okay so apprently bitcoiners have no idea what the fuck they're talking about"
Software gets hacked, this is a thing that happens. Tomorrow some chinese hacker could gain access to my bank account and (try to) empty everything.
Two things would happen: I would immediately get notified and my bank will put a lock to any suspicious activity going on. I would lose exactly 0€ in the process.
This is what normal people call "security".
Furthermore, my bank insures me against phishing and scamming up to 250k€, even if I actually gave away all my banking ID.
I'm not on some sort of premium account. The entire thing costs me 18€/year.

This has absolutely nothing to do with money laundering.
Money laundering is what you do when you have a bunch of suspicious moneys you want to make not suspicious. Which is something you don't need to do if you have legit moneys, since it's legit and doesn't need to be laundered.
I don't even know why I am surprised a bitcoiner has no idea about anything money related.

@_date: 2014-12-18 18:42:39


I never send cash by mail, indeed.


I've been travelling all over the place and I've literally never had this problem. But then, I suppose I'm not surprised someone in would choose a payment system nobody else actually uses as a benchmark.


Two minor websites that process very little transactions that 3 whole merchants use are your solution to all Bitcoin problems?


I would ask them why they would choose an obviously inferior product nobody cares about.


Or you could not be a retard and not get an AMEX card in the first place. No need to apply to 45 websites just to buy some dinner abroad!


That's the fucking awesome thing about CC. I don't need to deal with any of this bullshit. Because I don't actually *need* escrow arbitrators integrated into some random software I need to carry around in my phone to pay for shit. 
Just put CC in, type PIN, boom done. Money gets transferred and I have the option to chargeback if shit goes wrong + my money is insured. Crazy I know.


Yes, I'm sure every bank out there charges the exact same thing ever.


Okay, now read what you just wrote, and consider the amount of different protocols you've mentionned here, one of these not even out yet. And this is *just* to make sure you don't get screwed when making a purchase.
Like I said, reinventing the wheel and somehow making it square.
Lol, that website that requires you to manually sign in, check for an arbitrator, agree with the merchant about it, and pay fees on top of fees on top of fees.
This is the solution, guys. Something overly convoluted can't be nothing but technological advancement.
I mean, look at CCs, you can order something with 3 clicks and without even thinking about it, you get all the consumer protection you'll ever need! This is obviously an inferior solution because you didn't spend 4 hours choosing the perfect arbitrator.

2) Actually it's pretty different since I've yet to encounter a single merchant (and particularly online ones) that don't accept my debit card, internationally.
3) "You don't don't pay arbitrator fees if you don't need them. Oh and you could fix that other problem by needing arbitrators."
4) I don't need to "close my eyes and hope for the best" when making CC transactions, or SEPA transfers, or anything money related, because i'm not using bitcoin, and my bank knows that if it wants to  keep my business, they need to work with me and not against me.


Congratulations, you just aleniated a significant portion of the population who doesn't own a smartphone or can't afford one.
5) has nothing to do about "fighting my cc company"


It absolutely is not. I have simply described the process of purchasing something using the website who's name I forgot and cba to check back. I also simply described the process of purchasing anything using a debit card.


Won't be fighting anyone. My money is insured. In fact I made one relatively large withdrawal from an ATM i'm not used to going and my bank fired an alert and contacted me like 2 hours later asking if it was fraudulent or not. 


I'm sorry your bank sucks, mine insures my money (up to 250k€) even if I have volutarily given all my banking details to a scammer. Maybe you should read your contract and insurance info before signing it.
See, this is one thing you bitcoiners fail to understand. When someone manages to steal my EURs, I can *relatively easily* get them back.

How to buy an item with bitcoin if you want some basic form of customer protection people actually expect straight up from any payment system:
* Make an account on a third party website
* Find an arbitrator that looks somewhat competent and doesn't ask 3 BTC for arbitration fees. Good luck with that, since there's no rating system.
* Open a transaction, email the link to the company (or the other way around, it's equally retarded anyway)
* Pay your item
* Wait for the miners to confirm your transaction which could take days if you didn't have enough fees.
* Wait for the company to create the transaction to release the funds
* Approve the transaction
* Wait for the miners to confirm your transaction which could take days if you didn't have enough fees.
* Congratulate yourself, as top minds are working on every single problem with bitcoin totally making sure it's not some completely absurd waste of everyone's time, unlike evil fiat money, which is full of evil people of evilness.
* Oh wait, nevermind, the company you're buying from is not one of the whole 3 businesses that use this system.
* Bitcoin saves the day again!
How to buy an item with actual money if you want actual customer protection:
* Pay for your item using a regular credit or debit card.
Clearly bitcoin is the better solution here.

So please explain to me how fraud protection would work differently with a bitcoin bank instead of a dollar bank? They'll need the same kind of knowledge of your spending habits regardless of the currency used.
But more importantly, explain to me how all of this will be funded without actually paying transaction fees to the third party providing the insurance?


Instead i'll be using the blockchain network, which takes 10 minutes to process a transaction (time that will definitely increase with the decline of mining rewards and rise of power costs) and still not get any of the CC perks like fraud protection. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:37:59


If I needed to withdraw a large amount of money (which is something I only had to do once in my life, and even then was not all that necessary), I would just call my bank beforehand and warn them. Simply logging on to check my balance from holidays is harmless so I'd just get a notification (which I would ignore if I was the one doing the logging in, or would use as a cue to change my password if i'm not, which would terminate the hacker's session)


I hope you don't own many bitcoins because you will lose some of them with that mentality, unless you stored them in a way that they could never be spent, ever.
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:03:28


and everything shitty bitcoin businesses do is obvious?


Because bitcoin users are fiercely resilient to change (colored coins, actual useful infrastructure, proper financial tools, etc.).


And a pre-approved list of arbitrators in all wallet clients is not one of these things?

You can prove you sent money to an address and that there's a wallet out there with money you used to own. 


Yes, that's the gist of my argument. Congratulations, you've understood a simple concept: There are things that work, and there are things that don't. All you've been telling me so far is that "Bitcoin can do that, if someone gets around to making it work!" which roughly translates to "choose bitcoin today and maybe someday it'll be useful!"


So you're saying that I'm wrong that I don't need to deal with all that bullshit because my CC already has everything I need without having me to deal with all that bullshit? Like making sure the wallet i'm using has this feature enabled, this option tweaked, is compatible with this particular protocol etc etc?
So wrooooooong indeed...




I like when you use the word trivial when we both know it's utter bullshit. 


They work!!!! You can use them today, globally!!!! Or you could, if anybody actually cared!!!!


Would could should... Etc. Etc.
Look, I'm looking for a solution that works and that I can use globally. BTC doesn't work and the few parts that do can't even be used globally. And as far as I can tell it's not going to be wildly different in a few years if not decades.

I got my new CC in the mail the next day.
OTOH, I have lost access to my BTC wallet once and I can't access them anymore. Clearly the better solution here.

Barely. They know how much you typically spend per week and where the purchases happen. They don't know what you do with that money. If there is a sudden deviation in any of these two metrics, in 99% of the cases it's because something fishy is going on. They don't need to profile any more, and actually there's laws that greatly limit what they're allowed to profile.


Bad: Pay a small fee every year (2€/month in my case). Use it to fund an automated system that raises a flag when suspicious purchases happen. Like a large withdrawal being made 1200km away from home Retain all your money. 
Better solution: Lose access to all your money because you didn't follow the 48 rules of securing your bitcoin wallet, including but not limited to "never connect your computer to the internet", "memorize a 80 alphanumeric random passphrase" and "never spend any of your bitcoins".

Any time as long as software is supported and websites are up and companies are running. What happens if trezor goes out of business and your plastic bit stops working?
hint: you'll be shit out of luck that's what will happen.
I'm genuinely interested in learning, you're just spouting up selfwankery bullshit.


First, there was only one link.
Second, I asked you why I should trust Coinbase, you have directed me to the coinbase webpage that says "yeah, you should trust us".
Again, MtGox claimed to be insured, we all know what happened. Coinbase telling me they are insured has absolutely no impact on the trust I should give them. Again, they are insured for their losses, not yours. It doesn't mean they'll pay up if shit hits the fan. It doesn't prevent them from closing shop and fucking everyone over. It just means that if shit hits the fan, THEIR bases are covered.
So, again, I will ask the question: Why should I trust Coinbase? What tells me that my coins are safe with them and that in 10-15 years they'll still be around?
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:35:29
It's a valid comparison. People trusted MtGox with their bitcoins, people trust Coinbase with their bitcoins.
MtGox also claimed all kinds of insurances were contracted. Tons of people still lost all their shit. Coinbase is insured for their losses, not yours.
So, why should I trust Coinbase more than MtGox?
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:51:36
I'd invest in a couple bitcoins but the odds I would have lost access to them whenever bitcoin supposedly explodes are greater than me being able to make any kind of money out of it.
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:01:12
Lol I'd hate it if I had a few bitcoins locked to a trezor and that piece of plastic and electronics stopped working or went missing, or software support was dropped or whatever.
I think you don't get it at all.
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:15:24
Why should I trust Coinbase's Vault any more than I trusted MtGox? (ie: not at all)

Getting the opinion of someone who doesn't know anything about something isn't usually a good idea, just saying.
@_date: 2015-07-18 23:49:31
yet no one takes bitcoin seriously and you're an idiot.
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:19:51


Ah yes, the essential freedom of being able to pay someone to dump your garbage in a lake 'cuz it's cheaper than recycling it properly and you don't like lakes anyway.
Actually, fuck that. You should be free to dump your own garbage wherever you please. Fucking communists and their garbage recycling at gun point.
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:43:41
That and you know your moron of a neighbor is just going to be like "eh my house is not on fire I don't need no stinking fire service it's expensive ah need mah eyephone 12"
And then the whole neighborhood burns down because this idiot also doesn't believe in smoke detectors.
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:14:40
Italy had private garbage service and it turns out they didn't dispose of it properly. And by didn't dispose of it properly I mean they just dumped their shit up in the woods for years and caused massive ecological damage.
But hey, free market amirite?
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:59:09
Why would I buy this opposed to the actual weight of this in actual silver?
Or buying the actual value in bitcoins in the first place.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:04:34
Lol, a bitcoiner accusing other people of drinking the kool-aid. That's peachy.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:38:03
It's actually good for bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:28:57
I'm sorry.
These people all have seen their investment fall down to miserable levels over the year. A company investing a hundred bucks would seem like a lot to them.
The amount of bullshit around this "news" is hilarious.
"OMG THIS COMPANY RAISED POCKET CHANGE IN TERMS OF VC MONEY, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT MY GUESS THEY'RE GOING TO PUT MINING CHIPS ON YOUR MOM'S VIBRATING HORSEDONG DILDO AND CONVERT THE HEAT OF HER BUTT INTO BTC"
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:44:38
So what's the actual point of these things?
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:23:18
I mean, actual silver as in silver that you can actually keep and/or sell later
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:17:56
Bitcoin will be worth $0 as soon as the last business will decide to stop dealing with bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:20:34
It's ok, you just need to provide your full identity and banking information to some random dude, buy some bitcoins, and then spend them trough some software that needs to be updated all the time.
Much less of a hassle then just typing in a dozen of digits.
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:09:16
From the rumor mill:
now give me page views
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:20:22
I forgot, some local exchange. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:20:13
The last time I tried to transfer money using bitcoin, it took about a full week before the recipient finally got useful money to spend.
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:54:59
Bitcoin: the alternative payment for your fraudulent activities
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:15:40
Secondary, but preferred?
Delusion at it's finest.
