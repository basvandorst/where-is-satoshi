Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:37:13
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:16:35
I see. That's interesting!
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:47:30


True. But, we don't have that many users/transactions to need 1GB blocks now. Probably in a couple of years, but then the computers will have improved too. 10MB would do just fine now and also work on PIs. 
But I see what you mean by


I'm just a little skeptical of the whole idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:32:11
Yeah. I'm curious why there had to be a fork instead of a consensus to increase the blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:45:40
The max capacity of the SegWit soft fork is 4MB? Why are then blocks maxing at around 1MB?
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:41:11
Not sure what you mean with 100,000 nodes disagree. There were 4 times more miners on the side of BCH than on BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:19:05
That's exactly what that video talks about. It says it doesn't have to grow up that much and household computers will be able to run nodes. That's what made me question my stance on big blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:39:45
You can't really get much cheaper than 1sat/byte. Why would you even want to? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:20:17
I'm starting to think that way too! Do you have any sources though? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:36:14
But where did you put the reference number? Having the same problem now. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:40:52
In short, the case they make is this:
* With an average computer and network bandwidth **today** we can manage 1G blocks. 
* That would means **today** we can manage 10 times what Visa does 
* They have an experiment that supports those claims
To me, that means that :
* Bigger blocks won't lead to centralization
* In the future, when Bitcoin adoption rises, we can do on-chain micro, even nano payments with no problems
* Losing Bitcoin adoption by waiting for a future solution, when we have one now, is not a good choice 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:28:18
How is it better than simply increasing the blocks now? Why does it have to be off-chain? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:53:29
That's good, I'll have to think about it. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:48:29
That's the question behind this post, that raised after watching the Standford experiment. Help me understand why it wouldn't scale.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:40:24
I really don't think changing the divisions will help with deflation. I agree it could be fixed by a software change though, but won't be very easy, because of consensus, so better do it now. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:33:22
What's wrong with you buddy?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:58:30
Yeah, I'm questing why wasn't it done *yesterday*. 
It's a pretty cool research. Would love to hear thoughts. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:51:14
Tell me more about 3/. What's "the consumer economy"? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:03
Yeah, I totally agree. What you didn't touch on is the effect of non-inflationary money, wouldn't it also be bad? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:58:38
I'm kinda new. I've been reading about cryptos for about a month. 
So far my conclusion is BCH is better: It takes the control from the evil Core team that is crippling Bitcoin only to sell their off-chain solution which will bring back the banks and fill their pockets. 
Those are mostly the type "take what information they're told first". There are **many** unknowns to me, more than I can learn right now. Can you provide me some other concrete facts I should go through to see the bigger picture? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:13:25
I agree. 
Another point I've heard being made is, that the greater centralization you're talking about because of the larger blocks is going to be minimal, so it will be worth the tradeof, for small fees and fast transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:44:51
What's the difference between altcoins and hard forks like segwit2x? According to [this]( it only depends on people adopting the new coin, no matter fork or alt.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:08:55
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:55:01
Isn't LN worse for decentralization?
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:16:42
Yeah! He also said [this](
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:05:16
Here's another [video]( of Andreas, explaining something else ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:33:20
Yeah, that's true. Not a concern for me though, this can change rather easily. How do you change the 8lock5tream d1ctator though? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:46:58


I totally disagree, but there've been countless debates already ... aand I'll probably get b*nned. 
Anyway, I don't think the SegWit way is sustainable, to scale the chain. Also trying to never HF seems toxic to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:36:25
Yep. The downside of Hard Forks is that it lets people follow what they want. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:18:55
You really don't know anything, huh. He didn't lose it, he changed citizenship because American government is really far from what Bitcoin supports. Maybe you don't know what bitcoin is about? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:21:36
Check out a video from 2018. He's basically saying the same things. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:57:29
Well yeah, that was a cheat - not counting the signatures, but it's not a sustainable way of increasment. I'm asking about something different. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:54:51
So when 1MB is too small for Lightning and we fork to 8MB, will the old unfunctional chain be "The real Bitcoin, one and only"? Or will the fork be considered as an upgrade? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:45:04
Probably true, but one of the options it removes is getting ripped off by your own country, which happens a lot, which is what Bitcoin prevents. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:26:19
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:57:48
What are you talking about, did you watch the video? He supports Bitcoin and wants everyone to use it! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:59:08
It was a pretty standard malleability fix. The added block 'increase' was a nice bonus. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:17:36


I'm not talking about fees at all. 


But my chain uses it. I'm vulnerable because the vulnerability-change is on the chain I use. I'll get scammed because of it even though I'm not using it. With Chrome I'm on my own. Bitcoin is different. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:41:04
Isn't that anybody that's not a citizen there? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:15:20
Try make a post that lists the white paper :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:04:50
Whoever has most social power. An example is Ethereum - the fork kept the name, mostly because Vitalik was supporting it. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:39:39
I thought it's not possible to change the limit without a HF. How can it be done? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:09
I have no idea why people were so negative to your post. You used strong words, but what you meant was that Bitcoin is incredible and you support it. 
I'll keep supporting it too brother! 
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:28:44
Uhm, the protocol doesn't enforce miners to check signatures anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:15:53
That sounds like the banking system. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:08:17
BTW, by Bitcoin, I don't mean BTC, but this message will probably disappear before you read it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:10:05
We'll be better off without inflation and taxation. 
Fraud control can totally work without the government ripping us off by abusing control over our money. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:25:57
Cool. What would be the benefit though? Why not just hard fork? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:58:40
If false accusations meant anything, you guys would be rulers of the world. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:30:24
Yep, exactly my point. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:29:31
: )
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:02:59
Oh, and that soft forks is not voluntary for the miners. If they want to mine a new block, it **has** to be SegWit, so you don't have a choice, the new blocks are all SegWit blocks. The only choice you have is if you update your client or not. But that changes nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:36:19


There's a bit of double standard here. One side is "oh it's voluntarily, do whatever you want, no problem" and the other is "y u no use SegWit, we gonna troll you to death" as it happens with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:52:37
He's the same guy :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:17:15
Really? Wasn't Bitcoin on-chain scaling? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:46:16
Love your deduction logic, I wholeheartedly agree. 
Would love to hear your thoughts on this: Ethereum is the original idea, the thing that unites the forks, but each fork has something unique. So in that fork, instead of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, they should be Ethereum Reversible and Ethereum Irreversible. People can come up with easier to pronounce, commercial names, but the idea is that both are the original Ethereum, they just chose a different path to continue on. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:51:34
Thank you for the great explanation. I agree with most of it. 


I love you, hope we have a lot of conversations together! 


Don't you find a problem here? Even though I don't like the change, I'm stuck in the same chain with it. Imagine the ЕТH DAO fork being a soft fork, that'd be horrible for the classic supporters. I don't think soft forks are moral. 


I think it represents people having different opinions. And that's fine, I like having a different opinion from bankers that go only for profit. I really wouldn't like to see them do a soft-fork. 


By the definition from the white paper, non-mining nodes are not part of the "network". Just wanted to mention that for some future debates we might have :P
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:49:37
I think you're the brainwashed one. PM me, we could learn a thing or two while debating. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:17:45
You realize that -50% means that overall the gain was only 500% instead of 1000%, right
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:46:02
Don't know about you, but I'm with Bitcoin to escape the govs. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:11:40
What if I don't like that change and don't want to be on the same chain with it? Soft forks seem manipulative to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:42:38
Of course. He never stopped. And in comments there's still the support from people that understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:26:36


Why is backward compatibility a benefit? What do you mean by continuation of network consensus.
Genuinely curious, not being a prick. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:27:49
So the government devaluing all people's money has the hidden feature of aiding people in debt. How's that good exactly? 
Also: If the money is deflating, everybody will just save them. Same way, if the money is inflating, everybody will take 10-year loans. No? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:14:16
Wut? He was there last month. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:28:22
Not bad at all. Spectacular even. Just making sure people know it's not 1000% - 50% = 950%
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:31:06
No silly. Projects have a document where they explain what they are about. Check the Bitcoin white paper.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:32:50
Really? He seems the exact same guy.
