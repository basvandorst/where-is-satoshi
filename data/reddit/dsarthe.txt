It would seem logical that there are likely a lot of developers that are bullish on bitcoin. Why not bring in an army and get it launched next week since it seems there is already consensus that LN is the future of Bitcoin.

For those that are HODLing, what kind of upside do you think Bitcoin has? $50k? $100k? More?
My crypto allocation is 50%+ BTC and I'm trying to see if I should divest some and move into other coins or if I should HODL. Given BTC's market cap, it makes me wonder how much further upside it can have vs. some of the smaller alts. Thoughts?

What kind of upside does bitcoin have?

haha, yeah I bought ETH around $170-225 and traded it all for BTC when it was 0.038 a day before the skyrocketing of ETH, so dumb :(

If Lightning is such a game changer and likely would cause Bitcoin's price to increase significantly, isn't that an incentive to get it done as soon as possible?

Yes, don’t trade. HODL.

Why are they creating a huge sell wall? Buying more or what?
