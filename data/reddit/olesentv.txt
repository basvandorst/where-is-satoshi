It's not going to matter soon because the overall demand is going up.  But they are trying to make holdouts sell so they can buy in cheaply.  
If people already have a position in alts or btc.  Adding anything they can to it that they can afford is really important right now.  Even five dollars in alts moved over can mean something if done by enough people.  
My suggestion is that people move 10 percent of their alts into btc if they want to protect the value of both.  I recently did that.  And I also am planning on buying some btc at an atm this week.

This is the whole Scientific Method angle.  Bears love this one.  I have to prove to a "doubter" that demand is up before they will accept my assertion that demand is up.  They will usually post some slanted counter information to act like they already have proof that I am wrong.  This gets the poster into a defensive position to try to tire them out.
The market is getting bigger in the total amount of customers involved with Bitcoin.  Over 3k Bitcoin Atms.  More users on exchanges.  Coinbase has 26-30 million customers.  More bitcoin wallets etc.  Potential demand and demand are higher.  
It's just like how Apple sells Iphones.  The markets for Apple products have increased over time so it sells more products.  Aggregate demand its called.
Bitcoin at 100 million people involved should have a higher price than it would with 1 million people involved.  And historically that has held true.  Because of the composition of how people interact with things they purchase. If 3 percent buy and hold in a market with 100 million people and their average purchase is 400 dollars price is going to be higher than in the same market with 1 million people.
That's what we are headed toward and why the market for coins doesn't matter in the long term.  Demand has to outstrip supply if growth continues.  It's a certainty.

There are hundreds of sources and news articles.  I'm not going to do your research for you.

0 percent chance imo.

I did research and I know the information to be accurate.  If you find any information in the post inaccurate please mention it so that I can clarify it for people.

1/3rd of the machines allow crypto to cash.  Of the machines that allow it 70 percent are purchases.  OVERALL with all machines the percentage is 90 percent.

I'm not talking about volume of trades.  I am talking about the percentage of new money that is coming into Bitcoin that has no intention to sell because of various factors like:
1.  Lack of liqudity
2.  Long term investing horizion
3.  Non-agreeable sales price
4.  Etc.
New money puts a floor on the price of btc.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:10:21
Well because traders can move the price if they remove liquidity.  Just like bulls can add liquidity by buying.  But a growing market involvement OVERALL for Bitcoin is inherently bullish because involvement in Bitcoin many times means buying some Bitcoin.  Which explains why Coinbase was opening 100k accounts per day in December.  What else are they signing up to do?  The edge is that the absolute floor on price gets higher and higher as more money enters a market.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:55:55
You could look at it as both things.  I'm arguing that because of fixed demand regardless of price that it influences the floor price of bitcoin.   There is a reason that Bitcoin is not going to go back to 50 dollars all of a sudden.  It is because there is way too much built in demand to allow it.  
It's probability vs. possibility.  Sure anything is technically possible.  Bears want people to think negative temporary conditions they are creating by selling and short selling are the reality forever.  But unless they leave the market entirely they have to buy back to cover their shorts or buy back to stay involved with bitcoin.  
That's why FUD and the like are so prevalent.  Sellers and short sellers can't accumulate a larger position and trade profitably if the price doesn't drop.  
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:10:20
Ok that's awesome.  I'm glad you are incredibly bullish on Bitcoin!  Only meds I take are red pills.

In a market without such nonsense being posted by bears to knock down the price I would agree with you that my post would be selfish.  But if bears can own guns and use them to shoot at us, we should have the right to defend ourselves.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:26:13
Please feel free to research any information I mentioned to make sure it is accurate.  I believe that my numbers are conservative and might be much higher.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:43:29
Because shorts have to borrow bitcoin to sell it to someone else that is going long before they can be short.  Also because selling bitcoin is equal to being short.  So there will always be more longs than shorts by a large degree.  It's just math.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:34:37
Idk what the floor is right now but it's likely to be above the last low point we just reached.  It's increasing if I had to guess about 8-10 dollars per day at this point.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:23:57
Of course it isn't.  You should sell everything asap.

Ok so why post anything in response to what I am saying?  Why do you care if people listen to me?  Because you are a bear trying to do some more bullshit angle posting.

The present value of Bitcoin is about what they are doing with Bitcoin NOW or in the reasonably near future.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:47:29
They don't get paid in Bitcoin by working often enough for the price of Bitcoin to make sense now.

Fudsters are trying to torpedo this news but it's a pretty big deal.

The  reason that people don't follow through on Coinbase is because the system that Coinbase uses to analyze ids is so tedious that people give up.  I tried 20 times to upload a picture of my id and then I went on a web camera and it didn't work.

Even though I hate Facebook it's not good to gloat on misfortune.  I think Zuckerberg can turn it around but they are going to have to adjust a lot of things on the website to make it work.
One of the things I don't like is that they don't make it easy to unregister.

There is too much money coming into the market for short sellers to get the outcome that they are hoping will happen.  They have been using all of their power to try to collapse the market.  But this market is worldwide with demand increasing on a daily basis.  There will come a point where they will not be able to control it anymore because of math.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:53:39
The current price is depressed but the amount of money coming into the market is increasing.  So if Paxful is doing 70 percent more sales per week at a Bitcoin price that is 1/3rd of what of what it was in December, it stands to reason that money is buying more Bitcoin than it could buy back in December.  So more money and more buying power at 1/3rd the price.  Doesn't seem that a low price can be sustainable with higher demand.  It's just common sense.
The reason that demand is important is that it takes away the power from the traders on exchanges or large holder's to cause huge negative swings in the price.  Besides mining Bitcoin has a fixed supply.  So if daily new flows of money into the market are growing 10 percent monthly that means that the people that run those markets have NO CHOICE but to purchase Bitcoin at whatever price it is trading at to meet that demand.  
It's the same as Coinbase.  It's been 7 months of user growth but 1/3rd the price now.  Huge amounts of firepower to sop up a lot of btc.
Short sellers have to cover eventually.  They also have been using leverage.  They have put a lot of coins into the market with leveraged positions.  A lot of net selling has occurred over the last 7 months.  
When this starts going the other way the moves could be gigantic.  It will shock people.

I'm thinking about moving to Playa to play poker online.  I had a really good record on Sharkscope but Black Friday stopped me.  If anyone has a cheap room to rent or is willing to stake decent players pm me.
