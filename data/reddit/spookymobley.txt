This feels like a step backwards

Goes to show you should be careful where you spend your money.
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:43:01
yeah it's kinda ugly. The bottom part is fine I think but the top part is just yuck. Black text on a blue background? Who thought that was a good idea?
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:52:50
who in their right mind would ever use this?
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:43:45
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:44:03
Cool. To be honest though I could care less what gender you are.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:37:14
Everyone should have this! seems like a no brainer especially with all the weird stealing that's been going on the last week or so. Suprised Coinbase doesn't have something like this.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:28:17
the problem right now is most people don't know what Bitcoin is, and it's a sad truth. Journalists with no computer skills, how haven't had someone explain it to them, might find all of it daunting an spread misinformation. It's going to change soon, lots of people are graduating and coming up who are really passionate about Bitcoin. Educating the masses is goin to take a long time, but I believe you need to start with the source of most information.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:14:20
pretty cool, I think if someone like IndieGoGo or Kickstarter started using it, it would be more powerful. But I like that people are out there trying to create new platforms and competing with the big guys.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:07:52
as soon as I read that I thought the same thing -_-
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:37:36
I stream and I have a small banner below my stream with a URL to my coinbase donation form.
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:19:01
wish there was just an email
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:13:16
haven't got anything yet but it is disappointing. I'll probably be switching over to someone else today.
@_date: 2014-04-10 01:45:59
I'm so glad people still know about zombocom
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:43:34
Why can't people just leave well enough alone
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:46:34
thats what I said XD
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:42:04
I agreed with some of this, the authority stuff not so much. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:40:29
thank you sir :)
@_date: 2014-05-19 04:08:13
yeah in a way, but you're also hoping that the other 10% will come in. I think if companies like Bitpay and Coinbase pledge a bit to help smaller companies and group emerge it would work great.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:00:29
.somewhat lessons the barrier of entry and makes it easier for the average person and makes it easier to wrap their heads around it.
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:56:21
This isn't the answer to the problem. This sounds dumb.
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:35:50
The person who wrote this doesn't seem to get it
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:42:13
Spent 100 there 6 months ago and lost 50 overtime. Cashed out. Don't do it.
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:41:32
Very cool!
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:13:04
The funniest thing about this is that he's a "basic creature"
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:39:30
never got into Gox luckily.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:33:23
I use cex, not really concerned with making money. I use the small amount I receive from mining to buy gift cards and such and pump the coins into the economy. We can't make it a currency without using it like one afterall.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:48:54
We should mine on some other pools 
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:44:17
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:37:40
Applebees has these as well, would be pretty cool
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:32:59
i went to that job fair and have an internship lined up because of it. Thanks Andreas for mentioning it all over the place, wouldn't have got here without your passion! Also thanks to everyone who made it possible.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:36:37
Sound like a cool idea, would people be able to buy shares like other mining facilities?
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:44:18
I double checked everything in the blog post, moved things around on cryptsy. Everything is working perfectly fine.
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:35:56
That would be cool, but it would be hard for small business to do.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:46:27
I would buy a ton at 10. Not exactly a bad thing unless you're a day trader our put all your savings in it.
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:35:31
I was waiting for someone to say this
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:49:19
I would say 5 dollars. That's enough for a small lunch, or at least part of it.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:24:45
I might be interested
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:37:22
i'm staying far away from this
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:47:05
I would love to visit dogetopia    
    
much pleasure, many sand
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:46:29
This should be a lesson for everyone, keep backups
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:47:29
Sooooo, they are creating a cc....that's not really a cc......I think bitcoin will be fine. Id rather just use overstock from now on. If they won't take my money, there are others who will.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:45:13
i'd vote for him
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:13:53
As a journalist, it's so annoying to read everyone's uninformed opinion pieces. Wish they would actually do the research instead of relying on Google and hearsay.

currently reviewing the rushwallet and I like it a lot, and I love the Onename integration.
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:04:42
250, I only see out going down, which isn't a bad thing helps adoption.
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:12:39
Love it, love everything about it
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:01:04
It does seem that way sometimes. The problem is most people don't understand it, and most journalists don't want to do the research.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:42:16
No. I literally cashed out my money today. I lost 50 bucks over the course of 6 months. Don't do it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:02:33
Pretty sure I saw a story about this on Washington post.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:59:35
That's awesome, I love glyde. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:15:29
Means due to volatility in the ghs market I lost half my money.
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:57:42
Yeah but to many journalists rely on other journalists instead of tracing the information to the source. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:03:29
yes please
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:45:44

@_date: 2014-03-07 20:16:18
great idea Andreas! Will definitely donate a tiny bit once I can.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:44:52
Companies are starting to pay employees with it. The hope is that we can one day create a hybrid system or cut out fiat completely.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:15:26
I have to keep saying this too
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:08:14
Yeah definitely.
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:07:50
Not talking about that talking about the porn. Read.
@_date: 2015-04-11 06:22:45
Just want to say this if it's not already obvious. DO NOT download anything suspicious if they send it to you, check your PC to make sure he hasn't put any of that shit on it. Even with that evidence, it might not save you from being prosecuted for having CP, if they somehow got it on your PC. Also yeah contact the FBI ASAP.
