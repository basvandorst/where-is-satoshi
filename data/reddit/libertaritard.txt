The extent that prices change is the only thing that matters.
Nothing can be said to be "lost" if prices don't change as a result of an increase of the monetary base.

1938 expenses were paid with 1938 incomes.
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:05:36
Yes. Dollars.

For who?
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:14:47
How did you get your dildos? 
@_date: 2014-08-07 05:11:09
That was a good read right up until the batshittery started:

Inflation isn't theft. Money is a marker for goods. The expectation that your money should buy equivalent goods across economies in two drastically different times is the incongruous one.

And how do you think that *devaluing* is measured?
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:12:41
Like, where?

I will be shorting that shit to the ground.

Which is a function of our courts, not bitcoin. Gee, do I handle this with my credit card? I call them and initiate a chargeback. Takes 5 minutes of my time.

[Transactions have been roughly 50k-75k/day for a year (flat the last 6 months)](
[Transaction volume has been falling over the last year.](
A very odd definition of "exploding."
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:28:29
That sounds awfully defensive.
@_date: 2014-08-07 05:04:47
But bitcoin is immune because:first!

Why would I use a cashlike product that is less secure than a credit card, and more expensive?
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:56:01
Idk. I think between 50 and 500 for awhile.
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:23:11
...which will cost more than the credit card system built on cash. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:22:39


Except cash doesn't have any underlying transfer fees. So do you suppose that in net it will be more or less expensive to have a bitcoin credit card service?

If Alex Jone's lips are moving, he's lying. And not just lying, but lying about the most vile conspiracy theories you can imagine.

Ladies and gentleman, retard economics. Completely unobservable.
I'll tell you how it is measured: the CPI.
If the CPI doesn't change, nothing has been lost. Therefore, no theft. That's why every economist except those Austrian fools use price inflation as the definition.

Look! It's the daily bullshit post.

Only if you're a [scamming hotel](
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:58:20
Yeah. We'll see about that.
