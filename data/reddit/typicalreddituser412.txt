Curious about the late adopter..
"Last week I met the first crypto millionaire I know who first bough bitcoin over 1000$. 55k invested at the beginning of this year. Late adopter &amp; late exiter is a route that can lead to the million."
How much we talking in terms of ranges..? 5mil...?

And if someone told me eth will be at 700$, I'd tell them to go to mental hospital

They sell via OTC desks which in turn sell to exchanges or other buyers.
I.e. cumberland

What a god damn idiot....
Unless he has 10MM usd worth of coins sitting somewhere in his wallet...
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:11:07
no one is expert on where the market will go.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:42:12
It is not a terrible mindset. You mind your own business. Historically, all my purchases using bitcoin have been terrible becsuse bitcoin keeps hitting ATH.

@_date: 2018-07-09 14:53:28
either this happens or it will get downvoted to hell . is a shithole. it's massively censored.
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:44:15
isn't this what they call censorship.? bcashers

i've become more libertarian than before, and I realize the world is full of idiots (no coiners) that aren't worth talking to.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:17:53
thanks. from this: 
it seems almost every pools are signalling 'NYA' in their coinbase string. with exception of slush pool? is that major ? why is slush pool not signaling NYA in the string? 
I thought slush pool was pro bitcoin, not pro btc. and they like the core team?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:28:15
yes but we'll worry about that later this year.  :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:57:54

if segwit2x thing activates, there will be no chain split and no hf , right? 
segwit2x (nya) seems to be the route that bitcoin is heading
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:33:25
yes but i dont want hard fork. why can't we do NYA and then have more meetings for august, september and august to avoid big blocks?
i dont want my bitcoin splitting in two
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:26:54
I heard u can if u move to puerto rico ����
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:13:35
can anyone help me understand. If segwit2x activates on aug 1 (NYA is honored), there is no chain split and no hard fork for Aug 1, right?
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:42:32
2 years later, i will be able to buy that with 80 bitcoins
