Well, I like the idea of a decentralized currency but bitcoin doesn't cut it honestly. Way too crazy prize fluctuations.

Everything is counterfeit on the black market dude

This is a fucking bitcoin cult. The only practical use bitcoin has right now is buying drugs on the deep web. A good use if you ask me but not really useful...

Of course, I'm just saying that there is no way to know if bitcoin will even be worth anything in 10 years. If its value has been halved or doubled. Bitcoin is just not worth getting into at the moment. You have to be super naive to think that buying bitcoin for 10.000 dollars and waiting 10 years is a good idea.
Edit: Instead of downvoting me, tell me why I'm wrong? I would honestly love to be wrong about bitcoin but I just don't see how buying 10k USD worth of bitcoin and holding on to it is a good idea?

You're pretty funny, why don't you explain why I'm wrong instead of ridiculing the way I type?

Im assuming the premise given in the tweet. Of course buying smaller chunks is a good idea.

How long have you had it?

Dude, youre fitting the prediction to the data. Im betting my fucking ballsack that bitcoin is not gonna follow your trend in 1-2 months.

Well, tell me what happens then. Im asking a sincere question

Im new to this community and figured this was a good place to ask
