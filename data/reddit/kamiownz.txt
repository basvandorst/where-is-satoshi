The trade is finally resolved in my favour because the other person was unresponsive! 4days it's taken.

LOL..

Yes correct. Since 2015

Yeh. I'm pretty annoyed with the mods. Waiting this long is worse than banks! 
Feedback is great from other guy, 1000+ trade, 100% feedback and been member over 1year. 
They need to sort out the system they use to resolve shit. I've even raised a support ticket as they gave him 16hrs then another 16hrs on top. No apology or anything.

Yeh I totally get that but not 4days mate. Max 24hrs if the guy is genuine. with thousands involved dont think anyone would be relaxed lol. He'd want to get it sorted asap

Yeh I get that bit being a vendor I like quick turn arounds. But yh I'm still hopeful lol. I know I'll get them it's just the inconvenience of waiting around

What do you mean?
I had the Ad up and he opened trade with me, had all his information for transfer on there. We've had Comms but he just doesn't release.
