And also comparing cryptoexchanges to stockexchanges. Cryptoexchanges are a lot more accesible and easier to use, faster and less fees. For example if i want to buy something from nasdaq on my stockexchange, i have to switch my eur to usd which takes a day. And then put a buy order, where i cannot clearly see the fees. Pay a 6.50eur fee for the order. And then have to wait for a long time before my buy order gets trough. It makes me really see the big value in crypto and blockchain.

There are some coins of which i understand and appreciate their technology. Sonm is one of them, renting out supercomputing power is a lot cheaper than actually buying a super computer. Also storage share coins like siacoin have value imo. And of course the major platforms where these can build on like NEO and Eth. I try to learn and understand, but in the meantime i make money.

Have you tried tradesatoshi?

Do you receive fees from this? Or otherwise something else in return?

I hope bitcoin will go lower. Then i will make one last investment. Strictly btc no alts. After that i will support btc by changing fiat 50-100euro into btc monthly to buy stuff with. Mostly food. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:59:41
This, timed manipulation. Whales want as much bitcoin as possible. And they know exactly how to play this. You think they let the people get control of the financial system, they will do everything in their might. But hey what do i know, just guessing.

Heard it in the radio this morning. If he would have had patience, his rig would be a nice investment. But the impatient wants fast money. The dutch don't play with money laundering, you'll get a lower sentence robbing a bank.

If you would have gave 100 dollars to charity in 2012 it would be worth only 85 dollars. If you would've given 100 dollar worth of bitcoin, today that value would've appreciated alot. Therefore bitcoin is good for humanity.
