1. UK considering taxing bitcoin - in effect recognizing it as a real currency
2. Ukraine/Russia flashpoint creates uncertainty in respective currencies
3. Mt Gox has fallen but bitcoin is still alive, could be some sort of dead cat bounce
4. China is unusually active right now, possibly due to deliberate weakening of the currency by the central banking authority

It really depends on how you define intrinsic. Nothing has intrinsic value if there is no one around to value or demand it, even gold, cash or other hard assets. What people mean when they say bitcoin has no intrinsic value, is that there is no govt or hard assets backing it (which in turn have their own "trustworthiness" or market values). Bitcoin has only the network and the additional functionality it provides, which theoretically are better for a number of reasons, but it will take time for people to realize WHY they should assign more value to a digital ledger free from government as opposed to fiat.

that's how supply and demand affect stock/commodity/currency trading . A stock may lose 1/2 of its value in a day because the value is equal to the market value x number of shares. However 1/2 of the value doesn't actually have to be traded. Only 1 share has to trade at a value 1/2 the original price, and if its the last trade that happens for a while - the stock is only worth 50% of what it was by market determination. What matters after that is if the rest of the market believes that is the right price or not, and where/how it trades subsequently

In stock markets, traders may frequently sell ahead of binary events (IE a new apple device launch, a fed hearing, a jobs report etc...) because they don't want to be exposed to the risk, and might have already booked profits. Everyone's been talking about the 3PM hearing, so its pretty understandable if someone wanted to close out their position just in case the results were negative.

FYI Knife party has been selling their Haunted House EP for bitcoin for a while.
