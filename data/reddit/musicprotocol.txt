i remember running 12 machines with decent graphic cards for about 3 months back in 2011... I had finally mined about 37 bitcoins.. and I already had about 24 coins that I had purchased for like $4 each or something..
I remember working out that it wasnt worth my time and selling them all for about $6 each...
making close to $400 and calling it a day....  
not a day goes by i don't think about the fact that would be worth $200,000 today...

dude... sell up, everything.. move to thailand/ecuadore/sandiago/greece.
spend $800k buying a mansion, car, furnished etc etc..
put $1 million in to a managed mixed portfolio investment fund... should easily get 7% EASILY..
thats $70k.. paid monthly split 2 ways $3000 each per month.. which is low and should demand very little tax even in these countries.. though I wouldnt declare it.. have it setup off shore.. (but thats just me) . 
you can both have very comfortable lives in these countries on $6000 a month... VERY comfortable.. expecially with no accomodation cost.
why people don't do things like this is beyond me... screw working for the rest of your life.  
you get one life man.
