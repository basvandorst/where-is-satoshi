@_date: 2018-08-26 04:38:40
No not all
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:29:06
Just buy the dip
If you buy the dip enough then eventually you'll own all the bitcoins

So worse versions of both!

Ok cool, this particular thread has convinced me to sell all my crypto and leave it alone. I usually had this explained as a secure and counterfeit proof currency. The people complaining about money having no backing like gold or silver have a really bad grasp of economics. Preppers are the type of people who think only gold and silver have value as currency.
@_date: 2018-08-05 16:05:34
Makes sense, until you realize that's what the gold standard was and really what gold today represents but as a physical object and not just a digital representation of value (which is what fiat is?). Really the more I think about it security and uncounterfeitability is most of what it offers. So I think I'm back on board? Idk. This feels stupid

This is why Bitcoin will never take off imo. It's deflationary by nature and would never work for a single countries currency let alone the world's currency. The best play would always be to hodl and never spend it. What kind of currency is unspendable? The kind that isn't viable
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:02:21
It's not really anyones life purpose, it's more of a group of people working for profits that push this. People are all about incentives and free spaces are nothing more than tragedy of the commons to them. Where there's a free resource to exploit and possibly get profit, people will inevitably exploit it for profit.
Fighting profits is the most dangerous thing any person can do

Corporations or any kind of conglomerate is cancer in society and economies

I dumped my retirement fund into bitcoin at 19k
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:24:23
It's a joke lol. But I have no doubt people actually did that from 13k to 19k
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:42:54
That's really only helpful for the accounting aspect of banking...unless Banks are going to start offering ICOs lmao
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:17:36
...So it will never have a future

MFW 98 in 2 days
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:45:04
Lmao the only way to get value, other than scamming gullible Americans, out of bitcoin is to buy goods  and services with it.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:30:18
But you can create a whole new crypto to do so!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:36:29
But that's not fair to the hodlers!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:24:07
If you hodl long enough you'll hold all the Bitcoin and eventually you'll get to decide in their price.

Did she really say this? I don't think a cashier in a bank is very in the know of bankings systemic changes
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:39:19
I put 1/4 of my bitcoin speculation money in at 7.5 and if it hits 6k I'll put the rest in. I'm in the hodl camp but the I like scaring the hodl camp. Everyone is so jumpy lmao. I guess people get like that if theyve dumped their whole retirement fund in at 16k
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:39
This man is an investing genius
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:43
If you buy the dip long enough, eventually you'll be holding all 21 million bitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:58:24
You guys should tell the guys who's records you gave up, that you had too give them up, so they know what up and the guys you didn't give up, that you didn't give them up, so they also know what's up
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:25:15
Lose enough that a you have to hodl to the bitter end in the hopes of making your money back
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:04:25
It's poking fun at all the new cryptos popping up to scam idiots out of their money. One of which is the Petro.  it has block-chain and crypto currency in the pamphlet then it must be real!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:49:53
This seems like a reasonable venture. I'll dump my 401k into it
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:28:47
The aroma of neckbeard is radiating out of this thread so pungently
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:51:09
If they put more than they can afford to lose them they have no choice but to hodl
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:12:27
Almost there. 5k seems like a good all in. Tbh I'm considering 3k
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:01:24
Yay I dumped in my retirement fund at 19k just 12k more to go to break even!
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:18:19
But what about bitconnect
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:03:41
Nope we need 10000000% rises in a materialy of a year bb.
