Who says that's good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:00:26
"Economic" means "[o]f or relating to the production, development, and management of material wealth, as of a country, household, or business enterprise" (
It is an "economic" system, although it is not an "economic system" (e.g. capitalism) which I'm sure is what you're trying to allude to. Perhaps my word choice wasn't ideal but I'm not wrong.
Regardless, my point that Bitcoin is socialist stands.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:06:22
You should really stop calling me stupid, you're just making yourself look bad.
You're absolutely right, me and my mob can fork off and you can stay on your chain. Notice that I said if a big enough majority forked. In that case, you can stay on your chain with worthless shitcoins. Enjoy!
But you're still missing my point. Shouldn't you be excited that Bitcoin appeals to socialists? This is something that you and I can agree is good, even though we have differing opinions about capitalism and socialism. Are you really trying to convince me that I SHOULDN'T like Bitcoin right now? How about we work together to promote common goals, instead of you calling me stupid three times in one conversation.

Bitcoin is a socially owned economic system. Do you know what socialism is?
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:58:52
That's not what I said. Bitcoin, the network, is socially owned and operated by the people who use it.
That said, if a big enough majority supported a hard fork proposal to, for example, reclaim a certain percentage of your (or anyone elses) coins for public use, than yes, your, coins are socially owned as well.
Not that I think that would ever happen, but it is possible, because Bitcoin the network is socially owned and operated.

LOL nice one.
But you still haven't addressed my argument once. 
Bitcoin is socially owned money. It's rules are set by consensus of the people who use and operate it. Sounds socialist to me.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:58:20
This is a new space and unfortunately we don't have a consensus mechanism for terms. If a pre-mine is explicitly defined as developers mining before releasing software than you are correct. But in general the term should include coins where the developers mined a shit ton of coin before anyone else knew about it, just for practicalities sake.
It is not relevant, however, because I believe Satoshi is gone forever and already destroyed the keys for those coins.

"In political and social sciences, communism ... is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the **absence of social classes, money and the state**." (Wikipedia page for Communism)
If I tell people I'm good with kids and then go out and murder a bunch of children, does that mean that anyone who's "good with kids" is a child murderer, or that I lied about being good with kids? This is the same reasoning you are using to say that all communists support genocide.
"Communist dictator" is an oxymoron, under communism there would be no state to dictate. Unless you are working with a different definition of communism. If so, please enlighten me. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:13:36
Ten years ago, couldn't you have said the very same thing about (modern) societies with money? Bitcoin showed that wasn't true. Perhaps we could use similar technologies to organize at a global scale without a state and without the need for money.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:23:52
Yeah I agree with you on just about everything! Especially your last point about statelessness. Centralization will always inevitably be taken advantage of. But I would note that communism doesn't depend on centralization. It in fact is by definition stateless. That's what movements like Democratic Socialism are about. The idea is that the equivalent of "companies" in a democratic socialist society would be democratically organized in a similar way to that of a democratic country, where "managers" are elected by the workers and can be removed if they're a dick or something. In a system like that, you could say there is a state but it would just be a collective effort on the part of every person in the state acting together, so it would certainly not be a state in the modern sense (i.e. a structure to maintain the existing power structures and property rights). It'd basically be an extension of the Enlightenment Age transition to liberal democratic government, to the private sector. 
Also, communism is not a political system, it's an economic one. Communism can be implemented within different kinds of political systems, more or less fascism in most of the examples of communism we've seen in the real world, which is of course by definition not communism because with an extremely powerful state, you're not really stateless. Sorry Stalin.
But I'm very excited about how DLT can play into this narrative. I think that things like Bitcoin really blur the lines between seemingly diametricly opposed ideas. It's publicly owned and operated by the whole community as in socialism, but is fundementally governed by markets and market incentives as in capitalism. I imagine a system that blurs the lines even further and leverages blockchain tech to efficiently allocate resources in a decentralized way akin to a market, but instantly over the Internet with a consensus mechanism. That formed consensus could be considered the plan for a planned economy, which was developed dynamicly and globally in a decentralized way. Sounds a lot more efficient than markets, waiting for price signals to propogate and all that. Who the fuck knows.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:00:09
You didn't respond to anything I said in my comment, but I'll do you the courtesy of responding to your points as if this were a real discussion anyway.
I gave you a definition of Communism, from Wikipedia, that I agree with. If you don't agree with that definiton that's totally fine, but if that's the case we can't really make any progress here unless you share what that definition is. 
Anyway, I don't give a shit about Marx. Einstein was a dick to his wife, but he still developed relativity and helped pioneer quantum theory. Of course it's important to acknowledge Marx's flaws and how they may have infleunced his ideas, but that doesn't mean the things he said about the world are universally wrong. 
And *anyway*, my views are obviously infleunced by Marx, in the same way that my views are influenced by any other incredibly influential person. But my views are based on my own existence and I absolutely do not agree with much of what Marx said and am most definitely not a Marxist. 
Communism =!= Marxism. The dictators you refer to may have been marxists, and they may have had the goal of imposing communism, but I disagree with the way they went about it as much as you do. Partly because I think communism is something that, if it ever really exists, will emerge naturally. I think if you're imposing anything you're missing the point of communism. 
Of course I have a problem with people killing many millions of people in the name of communism, just like I have a problem with Trump trying to ban Muslims from entering the US in the name of national security. That doesn't mean I don't want national security, it means that I don't think Muslims entering the country is a national security risk, i.e. that I have a different definition of nation security than Trump. Now I think Trump is intentionally using national security as a cover for his political agenda, just like I think those fascists were intentionally using communism as a cover for their shit.
What drive's innovation in a communist utopia? Honestly this line of thinking just makes me really sad, let me tell you why. Have you ever met someone who's really passionate about what they do? I'm studying math and computer science at college right now and I genuinely love it, every time I understand something new it makes me feel absolutely amazing. I have no interest in making money, I just want to learn more and make cool shit. Throughout history, think about how many artists have devoted their life to their work with no hope of monetary compensation, like Van Gogh who was ridiculed throughout his life. The same can be said of scientists throughout history, and we also see looking at the past that many of the most influental scientists were people who just had a bunch of money and so could spend their time doing what they enjoyed, the most profound thing in the Universe, learning. All of the smartest people I know study what they do because they love it, not for money. Do you really even think that money is the most important thing for you? Do you think that you would be happy if you had more money? The reality is that once you get past the point where you have to worry about survival, and of course basic luxuries to accomodate your passions like computers and musical instruments and whatnot, money really has no impact on happiness. That's something that everyone should learn eventually, but it's something that we should teach in schools! Because we see every day that the consumerization, wanting and wanting more and more, is not good for us as individuals or a society. Kids these days are depressed as shit, and they're in their phones all day not making real friends and having real conversations, just looking at the constant stream on social media of perfect looking lives that they will never have. And living in a system that not only promotes but *requires* us to consume like this is just unsustainable, and sad. 
Yeah let's talk about a free society. Are you free if you live in the country with the second highest incarceration rates, where many of those prisoners are held in private prisons which are free to lobby politicians to increase the jailed population? Or if you have to work multiple minimum wage jobs to make rent? Or if you live on the street? 
Freedom isn't having six different kinds of fucking chips to choose from at the grocery store, freedom is being able to exist as a human being without having to fear for your continued existance as a human being, and being able to pursue your passions. You know, that whole "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" thing.  
I hope you're not upset by this, I'm not trying to start an argument. My expletives were mostly for comedic effect and emphasis, not cause I'm mad at you. I just want you to understand the ideas behind the modern left and why there is such a resurgance of these ideas these days. The ideas you think of when you think of communism are just not at all the ideas that people like Bernie Sanders and I have. I think there is a lot to learn from people you disagree with on both sides and I hope you agree.

If enough people start rejecting blocks under 20% max size, the longest valid chain (even from the perspective of an unupgraded node) will have a minimum blocksize. Hard fork EXPANDS the definition of a "valid" block, soft fork RESTRICTS the definition of a "valid" block.

If you've received many small transactions and you want to spend them all at once, your transaction will have many inputs and thus be larger. This is like having the pennies.
Otherwise if you received one large transaction and you just want to spend that, your transaction has one input and is smaller. This is like having a crisp $100 bill.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:03:57
Once we have a fix for transaction malleability in under 24 hours, that'd be a breeze to implement. It'd be possible before then, but a lot harder. You'd have to watch the blockchain to pull the TXID when it eventually does confirm and pass that into the next transaction. 
This is actually the same reason that Lightning is better with Segwit. Lightning relies heavily on making transactions that spend from unconfirmed transactions.

This keeps redirecting me to some nasty looking spam on mobile, watch out...
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:23:28
Segwit maintains the 1mb limit BUT changes the way that limit is calculated. With Segwit, you can make a new kind of transaction, and the new rules say only count the non signature data toward the 1mb block size, and calculate a limit for the signature data separately such that the total size is under 4mb. So, once wallets, exchanges, and merchants start using Segwit transactions by default, AND we start seeing more multisig transactions with extra signature data for lightning etc, we'll gradually see larger and larger block sizes.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:56:27
A blockchain is a record of transactions. Normal altcoins start with their own genesis block, but instead Bcash forked off of Bitcoin by making a change to the consensus rules that is not compatible with Bitcoin's consensus rules. So, prior to the fork block, the two chains have identical transaction histories. This means that if your address A was sent B bitcoins before the fork, that transaction happened on both chains, and so the same address A has B Bitcoins on the legacy chain, and B Bcash on the forked chain. And the private key associated with that address can be used to sign a transaction and spend those coins on either chain. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:54:26
Venmo suggests transfers are instant but in reality it just displays the updated value instantly. The actual money transfer doesn't take place for a number of days due to the limitations of the legacy banking system. I could write a Bitcoin wallet that didn't distinguish between unconfirmed and confirmed transactions and make fees tiny and claim transfers are "instant." The txs would EVENTUALLY confirm so that'd be functionally the same thing as Venmo.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:59:07
I expect people will gain confidence in Segwit as we hit a few hundred blocks into activation. A soft fork can be rolled back only a few blocks into the fork. Due to the politics, I'd give it a few more than I'd just any other soft fork.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:38:45
Just because the cellular infrastructure is there doesn't mean people can afford to use it. Even if they can, affording enough bandwidth to download the entire block chain is a whole 'nother story. This way, one can access the block chain via satallite, and make transactions on their limited bandwidth phones.

As far as I know, these are a failsafe in case of unforseen bugs early in deployment. Once ln is established and used for any system like this (which I think will happen pretty quickly) I believe that limit will be lifted.

BCH's consensus rules allow blocks up to 8mb and has an incompatible transaction format to prevent replay attacks. It also doesn't allow RBF (replace by fee). These are the only differences between BCH and "legacy" Bitcoin (as far as I know/can remember). BTC is in the process of implementing Segwit, which will increase transaction throughput and likely lead to MAST, Shnorr signatures, signature aggregation, and the Lightning network. At this rate, Segwit will be active on the BTC chain by the end of August. BTC also has plans to eventually implement a hard fork that would add a number of features, such as Spoonnet and a dynamic blocksize. More details can be found at the Bitcoin Core Roadmap. As far as I know, BCH has no roadmap for future upgrades.

Exchanges matter because they have a lot of downstream users. Most consumers probably don't care about what UASF even means, so they're just gonna indirectly support whatever side the tech and services they use are on. 
edit: but they both don't matter from a technical standpoint, they just show "support." If every service that runs on bitcoin supports SegWit, miners will have to switch over during a UASF if they want to be on the chain that all of those services' users are on.

@_date: 2017-09-10 19:15:58
I see your point. It is definitely not explicit in the agreement. That said, a mining pool agreeing to "support" a proposal means specifically that they will use their hash power to enforce those proposal's rules, which Bitmain is not doing if some of their hashpower is on another chain. 
You're right that there is no provision specifying this, so it is up to interpretation.

Light clients don't enforce consensus at all. This method just suggests that they DO enforce consensus rules for the forking block (base block size must be &lt;1mb). It doesn't change any rules. It only suggests the bare minimum enforcing of the current rules that it would take to check which fork you're on with a light client.

@_date: 2017-05-23 01:51:00
I'm all for UASF, but it's important to note that the difficulty only adjusts every two weeks, so if we lost nearly half the hashrate we'd have a slow chain, and it wouldn't actually be any more cost effective for small scale miners for at least a while--potentially even longer than two weeks since the chain would be slower.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:38:42
Yes!!! This is why we need to be careful about blocksize increases.
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:17:53
(sorry this was a while ago, comment was linked to) 
This is exactly the problem. Just as you're saying for the average miner, ASICBOOST is not cost effective. But you're making the assumption that you have to BUY the hardware. For Bitmain, what percentage of that $1400 goes to labor, shipping and handling? I don't know but probably a fair amount. 
Of course I'm not claiming to know that they are employing ASICBOOST but it definitely would be more profitable than you're saying and SPECIFICALLY more profitable than it would be for you and the rest vast majority of miners. That's exactly the problem.
