I feel like Bitcoin is going to be the store of value/gold crypto, but something like Etherium with it's "shards" seems to have promise as a more useable day to day currency (not trying to shill an alt, eth is just the only other one I've really researched so far). You'd have a system like today where people invest in hold because it holds value, but obviously use Fiat for everything else only you'd hold your "savings" in BTC and withdraw/convert whichever alt ends up being dominant. 
Also obviously I see this as a ways off, BTC is great, but too volatile in my opinion to realistically replace gold, but after some time like when all the coins are mined and there are no news one, I bet it'll stabilize at a high value and be here to stay. I'd love if the world all started using a single currency, like paying with "credits" in every sci fi

I'm personally enjoying it, giving me the opportunity to buy more as it goes down

Lol ok, I assumed as much but hadn't even looked it up or asked. Thanks!

Oh man that's awesome, I'll have to get that set up today. Thanks!

That's awesome but holy shit think about when Amazon let's you link a BTC wallet and pay directly. Cause the process of buying the gift card is too much effort for me to make it worth it, but if I could select Bitcoin as a checkout option? Damn that'd be cool

I'm just picturing a low budget remake of game of thrones, with you as Hodor (I'll stop there because I'm on mobile and don't know how to do spoilers)

I mean I'm using Coinbase with a bank account so it's already taking days haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:13:05
That's what I did. I made a mistake once and bought too high, so now I'm buying strategically at these dips to consistently bring down my "break even" cost (granted I just started and all my purchases are small) 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:20:11
$3,126,000,000 for 400k BTC at 7815.00. Damn that'd be nice.

I went for it. Prepared to lose some of I have to but I feel confident that it'll shoot back up 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:54:16
Huh? I own on Coinbase but I've never bought Bitcoin cash. It doesn't even show up as an option for me. Is there something I'm missing? Sorry if that's a dumb question, still learning this stuff 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:25:34
Yeah, it's only been like 4 so far. The profit from my first purchase (at about 5800) was enough to cover all of them so overall I'm still at a net gain. That's why I'm trying to be really strategic with my purchases now since I'm starting to make bigger ones. 
Is there a way to trade without a fee? I use Coinbase now

Ok I have to ask. Does hodl mean something? Or is it just "hold"? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:29
Ah ok so I don't have it. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:27
I'm staying up late(r) tonight to keep an eye on the price and buy. Even though I'm currently losing money, I'd love for it to hit about 5k so I could make some big purchases  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:08
I bought after the fork so i doubt I'd have any haha. Certainly wouldn't mind the free money though 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:59:54
I can vouch for this. I only started about two weeks ago and bought when it was about 5800. My tiny investment has paid for itself and I'm up a few bucks. I'm not planning g on getting rich off of it, but I'll keep adding to it and see what returns   
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:01:43
I thought the fork was called off? Or are you talking about a different fork? My very first purchase ever was on October 26
