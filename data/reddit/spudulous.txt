Hopefully it won’t be the day he chooses to eat his own dick

Give it a good clean with a strong magnet 
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:02:02
Yeah, they sound good

If you’re asking questions like this you should probably keep hold of your cash

I enjoyed it, it’s well written and he understands some of what’s happening. And he’s right that people shouldn’t invest in Bitcoin. It’s just past ATH, the fees are terrible and it’s slow.
But he’s wilfully downplaying alternatives and the innovation and possibilities that cryptocurrencies bring about. 
My favourite bit is this;
“Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation”
Crypto allows us to cooperate without trust, without even knowing each other.

Who is this aimed at?
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:40:55
Yes sorry, I stand corrected 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:13:03
BS title, he’s not considering crypto, he’s considering decentralisation

Their SEPA account is in Estonia, so don’t think it should come from UK
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:58:25
Ha! Was just thinking the same
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:46:06
Yeah, after a correction like this it’ll probably trade sideways and up slightly until the same thing happens on a larger scale in early 2019
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:19:02
It took you 5 years to work that out? Why did you get into it in the first place?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:08:48
Ah cool, very nice
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:47:10
And perform the sacred incantation 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:28:40
Yeah agreed, I had one large transfer take about 10 hours. Didn’t sleep much that night. 
Yay for decentralised currencies! :-/

Did you have to pay for your meal a few days in advance?
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:26:54
the video's just to tell the people what it is
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:37:11
Depends on the method, BACS and CHAPS takes a few working days but Faster Payments happens straight away
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:04
Dunno, 20-50 bits, depending on the level of fanciness

This is like saying visa and MasterCard is bad for the mint

Sad how much nepotism drives policy 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:21:57
Yeah, I’ve noticed that a lot. I always wake up to red on a Saturday. I guess a lot of people day trade on the weekdays and cash out on Fridays meaning a lot of people are selling on Fridays. Then fewer people are trading on Saturdays. And the day traders begin buying again in the Monday.

That’s classified information
