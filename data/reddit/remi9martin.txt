Are you guys not counting the delivery charges for the electricity? You can't really be just 0.13 really?

But the thought is this, I buy 1 coin for 4000 today, two years from now it's worth 8000 hypothetically.
1 x 8000 = value
I buy 4000 of mining equipment, and slowly mine. Say by the end of 2 years I have 1.4 coin or something. 
So now even though I mined slow and didn't get the value to rise while I had the coins in my pocket at the end of 2 years I had this:
1.4 x 8000 (+ the likely useless hardware) = value
So my investment didn't grow, but instead I earned coins that were worth more.

Copying this comment from above, but:
So really stupid question.... I've only done it once recently, but how do you BUY Bitcoin? As in for the best price, lowest fee, and without risk of getting scammed or hacked. I  haven't done it in years, and then I went to go do it a few months ago, added a debit card to one of the big Bitcoin wallets from the Android Play Store and the next morning someone had bought a $1300 plane ticket using my debit/credit card.
So what app or service do you guys recommend?

Yeah no no 6 coins was in the past, now with an Antminer S9 and the increasing difficulty if you chart it you won't make even 1 Bitcoin in 12 months, you make like 0.89

Ok so how did you spot this opportunity for this coin? You just follow one or two coin and wait or you scan and watch many? What kind of percentage gains are you able to make on average with this strategy if you don't mind me asking.

Right well only counting profits per day instead of total revenue and using those numbers should do the trick I think

Wait so do you mean there will be 3? 
Segwit 2x
And BTC classic but with segwit
Is that right? When is the 2x planning to drop? Thank you!

I like the idea of using it as savings, but I don't know why I'm the only one realizing that the $500 investment in either is not the same. IF you are willing to put in the effort, and IF the difficulty doesn't change ridiculously you will end up with more.
If you buy 0.5 coin you'll have $2000
I'll spend 2000 on a miner. 
In 6 months I'll have 0.5 coin and so will you (but it may be worth ie $3000)
So let's say at the 6 month mark I have pretty much paid for my gear.
Now 12 months in, you have 0.5 coin. I have 1.0 coin.
Yes I need to subtract costs of gear from that USD value of 1.0 coin, but I already have more. And ANY further mining that isn't futile due to increased difficulty, is making more on top of you. I'm constantly making a little more coin while both our investments rise passively.
Now the tricky part is estimating how tough the difficulty will get. Will I even be able to make 1 coin in a year? Will this whole segwit and fork thing pull people to BTCCASH and maybe difficulty drops?
