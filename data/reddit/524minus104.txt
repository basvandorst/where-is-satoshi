Gdax is jacked!  The chart and the ticker dont match... hell they aren't even moving but im afraid to refresh because at least it isn't the spinning wheel.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:36:59
Yeah I got a couple small buys in the pipeline for when it was around 9500.  Feeling pretty good about it now :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:52:40
Still need to be able to make the nearly $15,000 monthly payment...
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:21:35
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:02:18
It sure could be paid off in a month, but it might not be.  Also, OP talked about stocks, not BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:58:41
I'm really curious, and I'm sorry if you get this all the time, but I just gotta ask.
How much was Bitcoin when you got invested?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:44
Yeah I get it. Sorry just being adversarial internet guy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:25:58
Im very curious to see how this plays out.  I feel like the explosion of BTC toward mainstream  will heavily deter the huge dips we've seen in the past.  Like, there are so many people foaming at their computers while staring at GDAX that there will always be enough people to buy up the coin when it reaches a certain value.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:01:47
What is the best way to keep track of every single transaction?
Will coinbase provide all its users with 1099's so they know the amount?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:11:01
I dunno... i had  a 1982 Toyota Corolla-Tercel that I sold with like 280k miles on it.  Still saw it running years later.
Oh, and I treated it like shit.  Ran it damn near out of oil a few times.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:10
Yes, Thank you Andreas!!
I decided to become a monthly follower on patreon!
Just $5 a month helps keep him doing what he is doing.  If you really appreciate his work and can spare $5, you could do the same!
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:16:13
Trezor can also do Zcash and Dash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:33:49
An entire sector is worth more than 1 company!! OMG!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:33:44
3 hours later at 12,380.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:11
But what's the bottom???
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:42:54


Sorry, I was unclear.  I was implying it must maintain some kind of value for them to continue making money off it. 
My bad.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:14:18
Every day and every step BTC is charting new territory.  It's just how it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:56:34
I know the feeling.  The day before this, I decided to make a $5 monthly contribution on patreon.  Now that Andreas has proper funding, I will still be donating $5 a month to his patreon :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:16:10
As someone fairly new to this game, could someone answer me this question?
BTC, in times before, had quick transactions and low fees.  But as usage went up, these qualities changed to what we are seeing now.  Yes?
Current volume for BTC is 12 Billion, and BCH is 900M.
So, will BCH face the same issues once it gets on BTC's level?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:18:07
First off let me say that I'm not what people would call "smart."
Ok, now that we've got that out of the way.
In the article it says there is money to be made whether bitcoin goes up or down, and that I understand.  But  if we look long term, the coin has to maintain some kind of value, no?  I mean you could make a bunch of money while it declines to nothing, but once the coin is worthless, then it is dead and you've killed your cash cow, no?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:27
I would have lost my shit over this recent explosion of BTC then.  I was banking on seeing some kind of meaningful dip, but NOPE!  Here we are cruising in the mid 12k's.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:29
SHILL!  SHILL! SHILL! SHILL!
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:43:07
I get what you're saying but it works both ways.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:12:31
Gdax taking its sweet ass time getting my funds available is costing me some serious cheddar.    Getting VERY frustrated!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:13:13
Gdax is coinbase. But they have much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:49:42
Not long ago it was at 5500
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:50
What a crazy day it has been!
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:00:21
Id say hang tight. You dont lose money if you dont sell. Bitcoin has proven itself the victor from another attack.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:18:11
My bank isn't listed on their list and I'd have to do a wire transfer by going into my bank, and quite frankly, I don't want to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:45:11
They just hitched a ride.  I don't think they were invited.
