It's been about 1000 years since I've seen a rage comic.

Thanks! Which wallet do you use? I havent really heard of other alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:33:41
I'm not holding a whole lot more than you. Pardon my lack of knowledge but what is a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:05
Those are so cool, man. But I don't have that much invested into btc as of now. So its not worth it. (Yet)
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:48:45
I am quite a noob...so a lot of that is foreign language to me lol. Face palm all you want...I gotta start somewhere.

How cheap are some of these coins you speak of? And how many are there? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:10:47
Currently using coinbase. I don't want a custodial wallet. I want one with my own keys where I actually control my coins. Sorry, didnt specify.

I'm able to play on high with scaling at 100. I have a 1060. Dunno what all the fuss is about. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:32:15
I bet theres some crying in there, depending on how much you lose! Lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:59:52
I applaud you for this. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:13:32
Ill check out mycelium for sure! Thanks

Alright fair enough. So on a normal day, what makes gold a non- fiat currency? I'm no financier either. I just like to entertain the topic. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:29:55
Love the comment about it being fun! It is fun but totally not worth it lol. I kinda wanna do gpu mining but I dont wanna fuck up my VR setup.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:40:36
Yeah I had realized that after buying. But I don't plan on cashing out quite yet anyways. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:53:56
You use it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:59:34
Thanks for the explanation. I cant help but ask, wouldn't gold be a fiat currency as well? I mean, what use does it actually have? If the world ended tomorrow, how can you be sure that gold is going to be worth something? Would you not say that food or water would be a more accurate representation of a non-fiat currency? Not trying to be insensitive. Just playing D.A.

Thanks for the feedback! I dont think ill bother wasting my time lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:02:26
Hmm. Definitely something to think about. Would something such as Litecoin be a worthwhile investment? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:12:45
Hmmm I do actually have an old LGG5 on the shelf...I could leave it on and let it mine away. Would it be worth it?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:53:05
Hey thanks for the feedback! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:12:47
Seems risky for sure. I'm not educated enough to do that kind of stuff lol
