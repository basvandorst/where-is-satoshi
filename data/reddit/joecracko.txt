I've heard that nobody has lost funds. Could you provide a link to the contrary?

The only give I've seen so far to set up a mainnet LN node used a pre-compiled project.
We don't trust pre-compiled projects.
Could you teach us to get a mainnet node running starting from the source code?

not everyone is as smart as you, myself included.
Could you please share your knowledge? Why is question uninformed?
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:09:25
My own curiosity now.
Race conditions and route-finding with liquidity. Are these current issues with the Lightning Network?
Or is just FUDding?

A fair opinion. We'll see what happens in practice a few years down the line.
It's history repeating itself I believe. Comparable to the Dot Com bubble/crash.

Hey hey hey

Gratitude, maybe. Not necessarily praise. If they're still even alive.

He's a voluntary advocate and evangelist for the cryptocurrency movement, surely. Also surely, he would reject the notion of being our "leader".

Go on.

Go on. People who end their sentences with "so..." usually have a point.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:50:23
Sorry! I was on my phone.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:24:38
Definitely did overgeneralize a bit in my last sentence. Sorry about that. I stick by the rest of what I said though.

A humble and solid answer. Good luck in your endeavor.

Have you considered setting up a charitable trust fund like the Pineapple Fund?
MtGox happened. No way to turn back time. You're going to live a financially comfortable life. The only thing you can affect now is the future. You can do some serious good for this world.

I didn't know the Avalons existed!
You're right. As a hobby miner, I may wish to go with the Avalons over the AntMiners because they're cheaper.
The cost/power-efficiency and cost/hashrate are better with the AntMiner though. Much better.

Do you have words of wisdom for a noob? I'd like to hear your story.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:17:32
I agree it's much less profitable. At the current prices there IS a potential for a ROI, albeit many months down the line. Side note, this venture is simply a hobby to start.
Have you ever purchased from Bitmain?
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:48:40
Thank you!

So is EVERYBODY who gives money to companies like genesis-mining and giga-watt getting shafted?
Will NOBODY make a profit using their services (except the employees of said companies)?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:51:07
With giga-watt I can see that. Both guarantee certain hash rates based on what you buy. Genesis mining has a fee-per-GH/s which cuts pretty deeply into the potential profits.
