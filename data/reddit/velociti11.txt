I think that your an ass who has a stupid opinion if you cant see the bigger picture. 
We have big named players getting involved. Like samsung and now whatsapp. Even Facebook is talking about adopting crypto. 
Dont be so narrow minded.

Gotta love all these childish comments .
I'm using crypto.com earn as is quite a number of people.
These guys offer crypto to fiat banking services. Can get a crypto loan.. or deposit crypto on a term deposit and make interest. 
They also offer Visa crypto cards and their app they are building is a 1 stop shop.. building their own exchange type app. A number of coins has already been listed. 
To get the 8 percent tho you need to have staked for a card. But then it also depends on time frame. I'm staked for a card and are on open term. So I'm making 4%
Easiest way really is to download the app and sign up and see for yourself.. if you do.. feel free to use this referral code bvgktk2sa7 .. gives you 40 dollars to start off with.
Or join the community. We have a discord and telegram group and are active on fb Twitter and reddit.

If the rope around the neck part is real. Dont do it. That is never the answer no matter how bleak the situation looks.
I'm down about 80% on my investments as well.. but being weary I only put in what I could afford to lose.. but alot of people are hurting right now.
Track record shows tho we will come out of this strong. No idea when tho to be honest. 
Hodl strong and hope your situation gets better.
