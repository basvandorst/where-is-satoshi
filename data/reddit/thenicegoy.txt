How do you call 4000 a dip?

You'd have to be brain dead to think Bitcoin cash has a future.
You'd have to be brain dead to not take advantage of others stupidity and make money off of BCH.

I wonder if any crypto community is friendly.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:29:38
Don't care, up way more than what I bought it for. A 30% crash would still be green in my book.

That's what 1 btc'll be worth a few naps later.

It's like comparing shoes to sandals and slippers. All 3 are different things with a very small amount in common.
Bitcoin is a crypto currency that uses block chain technology. If you want to know more then search it on reddit, you aren't the first to ask.

Sell here?

Everything is relative. People use the most stable thing as reference. There isn't any better reference available yet. And having one point of reference helps stabilize this highly volatile market. 
Change your view to look at price charts in terms of BTC, and you'll see most coins are quite stable. Which is the goal to begin with.

Animation is best for these types of things. It makes the topic abstract and people are willing to give a cartoon a chance before a human.

Dude ethereum is about to pull a lite coin... It is bottoming out with no hope... I spent too much...

Turn bitcoin to wine?

Depending on how much money you lost you can decide whether to replace parts of the USB with another of the same model.

I was about to say people are going to trash you for saying nice things about coinbase. Lol 
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:41:33
It's a lot harder than you'd think but easier than you'd expect lol. When I get a bit of free time I will find a way to do this... Pm me. I won't claim to do it for free though.

This is as retarded as me.... Not even mad. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:39:32
Coinbase is my guilty pleasure. I can't admit liking it, but I can't go on without it! :'(
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:36:50
Well, people are retarded. The same people selling bitcoin because of FUD, sold AMD stocks. I know AMD will pull through and jizz on their "speculations". 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:44:25
Bitcoin is like your parents, you don't appreciate 'em while you have 'em, but you hate losing them. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:10:38
I'd say easily below $2000 but above $1000. After that we are headed for the moon. Also, if you wanna sell, sell it to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:43:57
It's the typical "oh shit it's crashing I'm gonna lose my life let's short" normie apocalypse. Just hodl it out fam. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:54:31
OP is in their wonderland. Bitcoin is banned/regulated in over 13 countries. If the US or UK or Chinese government chooses to make a statement against bitcoin (which is a big possibility) price will drop below $1000 and will set the progress back by a fucking decade. 
BTW, I am just pointing out it's volatility, that causes it to not be mainstream, however I have full faith in the tech.
