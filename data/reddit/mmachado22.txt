How is pay per view problematic?  Netflix has credit cards on file, they could easily have a "buy one time" button and add that to your monthly subscription.  There is no way Netflix wants to move away from a monthly subscription model that provides consistent revenue.

OK just tell me how to buy bitcoins with my paypal account.

Great, now you've centralized money lending with Blockchain now!  (And given them the power)

Do I get SPG points for using bitcoin??

Please keep in mind that sportsbook.ag has a notoriously long cashout time.
My last cashout took over 3.5 months and they blamed a payment processor.

I think it's the opposite- if I own a car, I don't care if there's 25 million out there, it still gets me from point A to point B and serves its purpose.  If there's 50 million Bitcoins out there instead of 25 million, the Bitcoins outstanding affects the value of your Bitcoins.

I should open a bank......

God is a little less volatile.

Isn't inflation at all-time lows?
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:26:43
Thank you!  I didn't realize the sell part would initiate the bank transfer part as well.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:50:56
I now understand that, thanks!

Yeah believe you me, I'm using Coinbase moving forward, i'm avoiding that time trap that it MT Gox.  I guess if it's agreed that the Coinbase ask price is more closer to market.  (Having used MT Gox the first time, I kind of took that as the baseline.) Without knowing how long it could take.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:26:48
Thank you!

OK, so how do I get money out of this bad boy?  
I know I don't stick an ATM card in, what is the process like?
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:05:40
Thanks for the response.  OK so transfer them to my wallet?  Would the plan to be to wait to transfer it back to a site that I thought could legitimately allow me to cash out in the future?
@_date: 2013-10-29 00:09:41
How do I reach these kids?

I agree with you on pts 2 and 3, it's ridiculous the "float" banks create with checks, and delays transferring money.
You could use paypal though for some simple "split the cost transactions."

Well right now you can sell 1 bitcoin on coinbase for  $197.06 USD each, while on MT Gox, you can sell 1 bitcoin for "Lowest Ask Price" of $209.50000.
What I'm saying is coinbase does offer some convenience, but unfavorable exchange rates.  
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:25:44
What is "cash fiat out" is that the same as cash out?
@_date: 2013-09-30 02:07:43
You think they, or other companies accept Bitcoins will pay taxes on them?
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:29:33
Good point!  I think the delays in transfers could be the most ridiculous thing of all time.  These are electronic transfers that take place INSTANTLY.  What's up with the delay??
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:14:49
Refer them to sports betting on bitbook.biz 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:49:27
So at the beginning of the transaction you scan the address you want the bitcoins sent to?
@_date: 2013-07-11 06:30:01
I'm really trying to avoiding having to go out and meet people, would ideally like to just do it online.  Is it a big deal if i use ID of sorts, like a passport or drivers license? 
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:46:05
What is coinbase doing differently?
Is it just a matter of time before they get caught up in the same problems?
@_date: 2013-07-11 06:29:14

Mt gox told me there's delays transferring to my wallet. 
What's up with that?
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:08:38
If you wanted to sell 10 BTC right now, would you use coinbase and pay their current market rate of $197 each, or use MT Gox which the lowest ask price is $209.  I'm saying coinbase bakes their fees into the lower ask price.  
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:41:11
Their exchange rate seems a little unfavorable to that of mt gox, is that the trade off for speed? (Not waiting 8 weeks for mt gox?)
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:06:08
What is the trust part about?  Isn't it more about if the government will intervene again?
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:21:35
So ridiculous!  How is that an acceptable business practice?
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:32:19
If I deposited funds via MT. Gox, will I be able to cash out?

"Second, bitcoin has the network effect, which is the fact that everyone gets more benefit if more people join the cause. People already into bitcoin benefit if more people join — and people not into bitcoin benefit by hopping on board. It’s win/win. It’s viral."
This sounds like a pyramid scheme.
