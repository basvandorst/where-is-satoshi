Speaking of Eligius, I mine there and I have my coins goto a paperwallet for long term storage since I like having "No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)" with my coins.  How do I sign with a paperwallet to change from Tonal bitcoin ~0.04 per auto withdraw to something more meaningful.  Say 0.25 btc?  I use bitaddress.org to generate my addresses.

Yes.  There is a chance of $500 in early 2016.  There is a chance of $500 in late 2015.

I had the same problem a few weeks ago.  It didn't confirm after ~24 hr.  There is a way to manually push the transaction:  
Double click on the transaction to get it transaction ID.  
Click help/debug window  
Open the console tab  
Type getrawtransaction (paste transaction ID)  
This will dump a big string, paste in into blockchain.info/pushtx page and press send.

The article states "Ninety-eight bitcoin addresses have possession of between 10,000 and 21 million bitcoins."  
That is just wrong. There are going to be 21 million bitcoins total and there are ~12 million today.  Also, a person can have multiple addresses in a single wallet.  If 10 addresses each had 1 bitcoin, then it would only show up under the 1 bitcoin area on the list.

I've browsed through Satoshi's posts on bitcointalk and the closed thing to that 'toxic community' statement was when Satoshi said "It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context.  WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us." on December 11, 2010, 06:39:16 PM .  This was his 2nd to last post on the forum "before venturing into more complex ideas." on December 12, 2010.  Gavin said the last email he received from Satoshi was in April 2011. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:27:04

Please read this post on bitcointalk about GAW:   GAW is extremely shady and Garza is a fraud.  I'm convinced, as is most of the community, that Garza will be gone / fled in 3-6 months if not sooner.
GAW paycoin doesn't have anywhere near that much hashrate.  The decline in bitcoin hashrate is due to the drop in bitcoin price, not GAW.  Miners aren't profitable to run with the current price as it is better just to buy coins than mine.  Remember that the block time is on average 10 min.  You need atleast a 3-5 days to determine an actual hashrate because of the variance involved. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:32:14
"Right.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  **I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume**."  - February 14, 2010, 10:52:23 AM

No.  You just have a copy of the blockchain bit aren't uploading it. If you have 8 or less connections to the network, you aren't helping. Once the port is open, your connections will rise and then your node will upload to other nodes.  On my node, I have between 25-50 connections and average about 3 gb upload a day.

I have several of the Denarium 0.1 and 0.01 coins.  I purchased both the loaded and unloaded coins.  I'm giving a few away as gifts.  The quality is good but they are a little smaller than I would have liked.  The coins are brass.  Since I'm in the USA, I had to use a 3rd party to get the loaded coins here so that added a little to the price.  The private key is stored under a sticker on the back of the coin.  The sticker has a tamper seal on it so you can see if it were removed.  You have to trust Denarium that they don't keep a copy of the private key.  Denarium just finished their 3x auctions for a total of 50 1bitcoin 1 oz silver coins.  I think the average bid was around 0.40 btc just for the coin.  Denarium is adding a multi signature coin in the future.

* The bitcoin economy is small but growing rapidly thanks to the current rise in the price of the coins.  
* If you are in the US, tax laws are almost non-existent for bitcoin.  However, it would probably be treated as a capital gain on Schedule D.  Here is a good site for more information   
* Just follow the other comments about encrypting and making sure that you have your coins in a safe place.  If it was from early 2009, then you may have quite a bit of coins and a very nice payday.

True.  The value of the coin may increase, but to determine a true ROI, compared the cost the devices now in dollars and compared them to the cost of buying a bitcoin now in dollars.  You will most likely never make the bitcoins back if you bought the miners instead of buying the coins outright

Didn't Chris Hadfield, when he was on the ISS, get a small amount of bitcoin via bittip a few months ago?

It is showing empty with no transactions 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:25:54
That is correct. ASICMiner is no long making them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:19:04
You mean the miners who find the blocks in which the transaction is encoded and allows bitcoin to exist/function?
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:24:50
Good point.  Just updated to Google drive with a relevant file name.

Haven't read the post yet but you can start by saying "Bitcoin"  not "BitCoin"
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:55:14
That would be awesome if it would happen.  I've saved a copy of the chart and this post and will check back in 1, 2, 3 years to see how it looks then.

I hope whoever/wherever Satoshi is, that he/she/they stay anonymous and are never found.

There was a block on slush's pool that was solved in 4-5 seconds over the summer. That was really nice.

You'll get it in 2 weeks.  No refunds

Forgot to add, if you decide to cash out, most countries have money laundering laws that flag large transactions between bank accounts.  In the US, it is $10,000.  Banks are required to fill out some paperwork and it may take days or weeks for the transfer to "process".  So if you have a large amount of coin to exchange for cash, you will probably need to talk with an accountant and/or bank manager before you try ACH (coinbase transfer to bank account)

  * **EDIT** *  It appears that the coins started in this address.  I wasn't able to follow it after

The idea, code and protocol are sound.  This is very important.  The ability for a person to send money to another person on the otherside of the world was unheard of a few years ago.  This is the key to bitcoin/litecoin/etc.  A $6 billion market cap in terms of companies let alone nations is nothing.  I think that bitcoin is a binary 'investment'.  Either it will be worth huge amounts or nothing.  However, like I wrote above, the idea is profound and sound.  
**Disclaimer** I own bitcoin and am a miner

Got it. Right now the transaction fee really doesn't matter but when the block reward drops a few more times, it will matter more.  Otherwise I have no reason to power/run my ASIC.

Don't you need the password to get to the wallet anyway?  Isn't the URL on the screenshot almost the same as a public key on a paperwallet?

Here is an advertizing site that lets you collect a few micro bitcoins for 'looking' at an ad for 5 min.  You may make ~10 cents a day.
 
 
I've used this in the past.  I have no interest in the company except for free btc

Is 'Happy Christmas' a UK saying?  I've only heard 'Merry Christmas' and 'Happy New Year'

Brute force attack the login? or the saved wallet.dat file?

define 'past'

OP - What did you decide? Price has increased a bit in the last week.

Use this site instead:

...to a level higher than before the crash.

Couldn't you send all of the transactions at once and only pay the miners fee once?
