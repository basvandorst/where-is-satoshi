with the fees and taxes it just seems too much of a hassle to sell and repurchase it over and over when I wanted to buy and hold bitcoin as the world adopts it. 
I still spend it with other bitcoin people but hodling feels better. Too each their own, bitcoin doesnt discriminate!
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:50:11
look at the rupee 500 and 1000 notes that were pulled out of circulation a few years ago, and how poorly that currency has done for the last 10 years
look at Turkish Lira losing half its value over the last 5 years 
The Argentine Peso has had even bigger losses over the last 5 years
Then there is the Russian Ruble, ever since those sanctions by the US it's needed Russia/China trade deals to keep the currency afloat. 
China / US "trade war" could just as easily be called currency war. China believes the Yuan should be valued higher on the global markets than what the US/IMF "allow" it to be valued at. The special drawing rights "basket" of currencies gets renewed next year for %'s each nation has, I would guess China wants more recognition on that one next year.

Its one of the smartest innovations in 100 years, just this idea of "how would we create money today, if nothing existed for money" - damn right it would be closer to bitcoin than anything the banks offer. 
Even in areas the banks arent trying to fuck up, moving paper money into digital, then online, compared to what bitcoin does it is just so obvious that the old banking system "adapting" to tech is going to need an outside force to keep them in line with the banking offers. 
God damn I love bitcoin

Seriously, do the math and have a game plan on amount you can spend over x time

No, we saw the transactions attacked with spam after the Bcash fork in 2017. It cost a LOT more to spam attack the bitcoin blockchain now, increasing the fees for everyone.

The cost to mine/sell gold has increased exponentially over time, miners in bitcoin have seen increased costs to mine over time as well. You cant just do this on your laptop and solve the blocks. 
Central banks just add numbers to their digital ledger (blockchain isnt bitcoins innovation - its 'proof of work' -- blockchain is just a digital ledger). The holders of the money the central banks add cant even see the money supply of the national currencies. 
We cant request an audit, they wont allow it... wtf 
Gold cant be audited. Then you have to take into account the older generation giving their debt bags to the younger generation, with all the fiat currency (that can't be audited). 
2nd layers in bitcoin and things that work with bitcoin as a settlement layer will or wont scale over the next 10 years. 
If the central bankers ever have to compete with bitcoins monetary policy it's game over. They wont allow holders of the money to see how much is in the money supply. 
The younger generation doesnt believe any organizations -- you have to show them proof or give them a monetary item they can prove is fair to all the holders equally.

The dollars and other currencies lose value over time 
People have easier access to information about money, money creation and storing value than every before 
Central bankers will continue to mess with the holders of National currencies spending power, until people take storing value into their own hands with bitcoin. 
Even with the fake "fintech" industry (their tech is not innovative at all), the wake up call comes from bitcoin and these "crypto" offerings that show how easy it is to create and move things digitally without middle men. 
Education over time. Bitcoin wins.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:43:33
You need to set your goal for what you want from bitcoin 
I want to use it as global money anywhere around the world 10 years from now, either as a way to get a national currency while traveling or as a payment method with the 2nd layers and side chains that are being added. 
As far as "price" its easy to stay above inflation so I stopped caring awhile ago about price, Ive bought for 4 years now and its up on DCA by a lot.
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:39:15
Peoples education that holding a dollar, pound, euro, yuan, peso or any national currency leaves the "value" of the currency outside of their control over time. 
US dollar has lost 95% of its value since it was first issued. Quantitative Easing is the new "basic global income" for the rich to maintain their assets value, it won't work to just make QE Standard though - most people know this. 
Even the idea that a baker or construction worker needs to know how to offset inflation with the money they earn by investing in stocks, bonds or housing markets is getting to be a complete joke. 
We all need a currency that holds its value consistently over time. Some type of global store of wealth that anyone can own and hold without central bankers manipulating it for their own gain....
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:50:17
The Central banks are competing for their currencies to be used by as many people as possible

Pegging your currency to gold was cool back in the 1900's but one is going to back their currency to Bitcoin and all the other Central bankers fiats are going to look less valuable in comparison

You arent going to force the Financial Industry into sound money easily. They pay for advertising on the media outlets that call bitcoin a ponzi scheme. Then they muddy the waters with "crypto" that banks or corporations will supposedly offer, that are going to be acceptable "Crypto" to them and their media friends.
Watch how bitcoin pumps before Libra launches or JPM Coin, then they will buy a bunch of shorts and sell their bitcoin position while pumping their coin. This whole space is more like "attack bitcoin" and be greedy left right and center.

That is actually a huge deal along with the halving of bitcoin. 
The rest of what OP considers important seems way less important than something like Lightning Network adoption, Liquid, other side chain/second layers etc... 
Adoption/infrastructure and payments with bitcoin means so much more than what the banking world is doing outside of bitcoin.
The central banks at some point have to convince different holders of "money" that their currency is better than what bitcoin offers -- they will compete, if you will -- and over time that becomes harder and harder for the bankers to take billions in profits yearly, just to allow people to use banks :)  
The holding of money/transfers can obviously be set in the code to be zero cost for customers to use their own money. That only leaves the lending part and very little reason for actual bank branches to be open in every city -- we never go into the banks anywhere lol

Go with Bread wallet or electrum for a first free wallet (not connected to an exchage)

just move your funds to a different wallet. The two types are custodial and "legit"

Just dollar cost average and you will be up over time. What is so difficult for people in this space to understand offsetting inflation and covering the fees for off and on ramping in and out of bitcoin should be enough for people.

No way. You are forgetting about the UK, Canadian and Australian housing markets that are propped up by foreign investment. 
Moving money to bitcoin would be really smart if adoption is going to increase over the next 10 years. There is no way to select the "one" housing market that will do well, it's pretty easy to see where "crypto" and finance are heading after the first 10 years.
No way people want to hold assets in countries where the currencies are potentially looking at being devalued though.

Hopefully you are planning to assess yesterday 4-5 years from now rather than reflect on your decision next week and make a move on it :) 
I still dont think people who bought at 20k will be able to say in 2-3 years "that was a bad decision." We will find out soon enough though.

ahhh gotcha. Guess I am not buying enough shit to ever look. 
It is still a sealed package though when it arrives. IDK that I care too much about resellers because that metal sticker and re-sealing, would be hard to fake. 
Plus the software has to be installed from Trezors site, then people are going to move coins on the device. I just dont think this is an easy one to get past all the red flags that would be there if you bought an opened trezor device with something weird on it.

It's a store of value with the potential to become a currency within the next 10 years 
the side chains like LN and Liquid will keep rolling out and be the way people move payments P2P quickly without clogging up the slow/secure store of value bitcoin is 
Why do you care about price when a US dollar has lost $0.97 since they were first printed in 1913? Shouldn't there be something backing it like gold, so that central banks can't print an infinite amount at the expense of the holders of money? The actual cost to print $100 is $0.14, it should cost a similar amount to print and store the value it says it has. 
Bitcoin costs $4000+ to mine just 1 bitcoin... that gets verified by all the other miners that wanted it. I like that type of currency better than this one the Federal reserve is telling everyone has so much value. 
What happens to all of the stocks and houses valued on dollars if the dollars aren't as valuable in the future as we were told they were by the old rich people with all the houses?
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:00:00

Since Sweden is supposedly removing cash, I would guess that "digital currency" the central bank isnt monitoring, would be more valuable in the future. 
I'd go with an anonymous exchange like Bisq, Hodlhodl, Paxful or local coin swap because having everyone's transactions and funds tracked, creates an Orwellian experience society should move away from not closer to, over time.

Libra whitepaper initial analysis: The only digital currency other than bitcoin that matters, and it could succeed massively. But.....
**it does not compete with bitcoin**, it reinforces bitcoin's value proposition, and will likely need to rely on bitcoin if it succeeds. Thread��
Facebook has some 2 billion accounts, and extremely detailed data on them. Its extensive data mining &amp; identity verification capabilities mean it has the potential to build by far the largest platform by user number of any financial institution.
To on-board billions, Visa or Paypal need to go through people's banks to verify their identity, which is highly expensive, manual and unscalable. FB tracks your every move &amp; knows you better than you or your mom do. They don't need a bank &amp; can scale much faster.
An international transaction on the Visa network has to go through clearance &amp; settlement through many financial institutions and central banks, entailing costs &amp; risks. On Libra, users can transact peer-to-peer through only one institution. The perks of 2b+ users!
Libra being backed by national currencies means it is backed by the USD, since all other national currencies at this point are backed by USD and managed by central banks to try to stay stable against the dollar. Other government coins are just dollars + issuer risk.
For billions of people, a dollar-backed Libra on your phone globally is infinitely superior to national currency in market depth &amp; maintaining value. If it succeeds, Libra will likely destroy most 3rd world currencies, or force them to be fully pegged to &amp; backed by the US dollar
For billions of people, a FB-based payment network will offer more and cheaper transactions than any other KYC/AML platforms. If it succeeds, Libra will likely eat most fiat payment processors like Visa, Paypal, and Western Union, particularly those functioning in the third world
Dot not underestimate how powerful and beneficial such a network could be. If access to global finance &amp; the USD were as easy as access to a FB account, billions of people's lives would be improved drastically.
Having said that, it's important to remember all of this is far easier said than done. Regulatory approval internationally is the main hurdle to overcome. But given the money, power &amp; influence FB has, they might pull this off.
But to be clear, Facebook is building a centralized payment processor on the US dollar and calling it a blockchain. **Like all centralized shitcoins, they've set up a 'Foundation' to pretend the thing is independent. They're even pretending its development will be open source.**
As shitcoins amply demonstrate, these pretenses are far easier to maintain in the whitepaper stage. Good luck to the Libra team keeping your development and blockchain open when people try to use them to send money to Iran.
The foundation will remain independent until it tries to do something against FB's wishes. Will FB just allow its billions of users to seamlessly shift to a Libra they don't like? FB users' access to Libra can be turned off by FB, utterly subjugating the foundation to FB's will.
The only functional advantage of calling this centralized system a blockchain is arguably in regulation. Easier to get things by regulators by using crypto buzzwords than admitting to just running a bank. Otherwise, everything would be more efficient if centralized.
FB's comparative advantage is in processing peer-to-peer payments between its members, not in building the monetary system on which these payments are based. As long as government currencies rule, FB are beholden by their regulators.
In search of bribes, political favors, and attention-whoring, every politician worldwide will want to put barriers in the face of Libra.

What if the broke 15 - 40 years olds continue to have no desire to own property and move to different (cheaper) countries to rent a place though? If the job markets continue to look shit and moving to a new country is so much cheaper and easier than keeping your head above water in a western country, I would guess real estates going back down the drain in a very big way. 
Earning 5% per year just holding bitcoin is WAY more likely than with any property. Not sure why anyone would want to make investing more difficult than they need to :)

These are the types of situations (devaluing National Currencies) whether it's the Euro, Pound, Lira, Peso or Rupee, that legitimately are good for bitcoin. 
The Euro is only 20 years old and full of bailouts and arguments between every country on this currency. The chances of it remaining a currency longer than bitcoin is solving blocks seems very unlikely. 
In a world of shitty fiats, the Euro has a special kind of stink backing this currency.

Do you know how National currencies are created and how the value of those changes whenever the Central bankers (or government) want the value to change? 
Why would anyone want to hold money that the monetary policy can change year to year, depending on which politicians are in power and what their agenda is. People want to hold money that can store value without guessing how much inflation has affected it or investing in a special way just to offset the inflation. 
Bitcoins monetary policy is in the code. There is no owner of bitcoin or controller, we all know the rules for what bitcoin does and as long as blocks are solved every 10 minutes we are good.

you dont go straight into a custodial wallet (one owned by an exchange) from a gambling site 
That is bitcoin 101 because Gemini, Coinbase (pretty sure every US exchange) pays for chain analysis to see where transactions are coming from and going. 
You do hops to wallets you own, so it is at least removed from anything associated with gambling online. Some move it to wasabi wallet to mix the coins first because of this as well.

bitcoin just stores value and allows that value to be transferred between two parties without requiring intermediaries. 
value = solved blocks = $?
Nobody can blame bitcoin for what the world decides the value is at anyone one time. Blocks are still being solved every 10 minutes, which is what bitcoin is designed to do. 
And anyone buying bitcoin looking for "quick + easy gains" is an idiot that deserves to get rekt.
