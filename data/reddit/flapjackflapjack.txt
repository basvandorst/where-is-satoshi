I figure if I don't invest in something i'll probably end up just spending my money on food I don't need and other stupid things so I guess there is little downside.

I completely agree. I probably should have clarified that my parents pay for my college (I know, i'm lucky) so I don't really have any monthly expenses that I otherwise need to be putting my money towards right now.

A fellow Wright believer?

After reading it is seems likely that wright was part of a group of one or two other people, who were collectively "Satoshi" and created Bitcoin together. So while wright probably was involved in its creation he exaggerated that he alone was Satoshi

Definitely a pretty lengthy read. I think this quote at the by the author pretty much sums up the conclusion I had come to. 
"What if you were 30 per cent Satoshi. You were there at its formation and you were part of a brilliant group. You coded and you synthesised other people’s work and you shared in the encryption keys. Then, some time in the last year, you upgraded yourself to 80 or 90 per cent. You were already a lot more Satoshi than anybody else has been hitherto, but the deal, in your eyes, required you to be more and in the end you couldn’t carry that off."

For Bitcoin, I agree for the most part. Just found the personal aspect of it interesting.

Sounds like an intelligent guy! I'd love to have a conversation with him sometime.

Damn, it took me an entire day to read it. You replied in 15 minutes, how did you read it so fast?

The London Review of Books. There was a biography type thing written in it about Wright by the same author that wrote about Julian Assange. I made a post on here one time about it and (as I expected) got called a fool for thinking it could be true. 
You should read it though. Very interesting and gave me some respect for wright

Go ahead and wait for the cryptographic evidence. You'll likely never get any from anyone. If he proves himself he will be arrested and taken from him wife, so he's chosen to live free and accept that the world thinks he's a fraud.

As long as it's under 4 bitcoins I'll take it.
I'm glad you've at least read it. I get that none of the information is verifiable. But to me it is entirely too nuanced and detailed to be a part of some elaborate hoax. I was very skeptical for about half the book but ultimately I was convinced. It's possible I've been fooled but I don't find it likely.

I thought that Wright was obviously full of shit too but read this short book about Craig Wright and you may change your mind. It's written by a guy who followed him around, before anyone knew anything about him, writing his life story. 
When I saw he was trying to patent blockchain ideas the other day I was blown away by how deluded he must be. The book explains though how he's been working with a company creating hundreds of patents for years. It explains, very convincingly, just about ever contradiction and weird thing that has happened with him. I truly think that Craig Wright is a deeply flawed human being but that he is without a doubt Satoshi Nakamoto.
I expect to get down voted to oblivion because what I'm saying is practically heresy on this subreddit, but I challenge you to read this book and not be convinced. (It's long, actually read it, don't just skim four paragraphs and come back to yell at me that I'm some Wright shill.)

He's a deeply flawed guy who never really wanted to come out as Satoshi but was forced to by the contracts he signed working for nCrypt to develop all of his patents. This company was lining up a billion dollar deal with Google and wright coming out as Satoshi was a part of it. All of the people who were working with him basically disowned him but they all still believe he's Satoshi.
I'm literally never going to convince anyone of anything who hasn't read this book. I certainly never would have believed it before. It's an incredibly interesting read about Craig Wright so even if you walk away from it still not believing him, it's not really a waste of time.
