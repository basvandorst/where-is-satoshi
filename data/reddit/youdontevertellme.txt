government snooping? nonsense /s

Prepaid debit gift cards do not appear to be supported.
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:47:27
thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:10:12
how are these different? microsoft fail?
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:27:04
sorry for the confusion, it will not be the only source of income. also, i do not want to discuss the project in detail as it would be easy to copy. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:22:30
He's got a point.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:57:29
thanks. now what can i do with these bits? i can't seem to find them either. i feel like an idiot!
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:17:55
this + coinbase's buyback makes me very happy.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:43:41
makes sense.  sounds like a lot of work for a few bits.
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:06:46
yes, wtf am I going to do with 2 xbox one's?
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:58:19
this guy is spot on.  i wonder if some early adopters should help fund organization(s) that protect companies/people that come under the fire of governments for bitcoin usage.  the larger bitcoin companies could spend money on this as well rather than trying to please the man.  maybe this already exists.  sorry, i'm a noob here.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:55:13
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:31:27
Do you have access to the internet? /s
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:08:08
thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:06:01
in the account
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:38:52
i think that was only during BF.
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:36:08
just found out about this today: 
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:44:32
i'll need hearing aid once i'm done with these bad boys. thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:53:07


i expect the project will pay for itself after sometime.
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:55:11
TIL Beavis and Butthead are Bitcoin's CEO
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:58:04
I think pock.io is a good option for you, but i'm not sure.
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:37:38
i don't have a weekend, but i do have bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:15:41
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:20:02
ideal or not, we can't stop people from cloud mining.  we need trusted entities in the community to start other cloud mining services.
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:30:27
I use [bitspender.io]( a lot.  Might want to add that to your site.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:19:30
thanks! u just quadrupled the amount of bitcoin i had. WOO HOO!
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:13:08
I'm all up for p2pool, but we also need "cloud mining" competition ASAP.  Does anyone know of anything similar out there?
EDIT: 


@_date: 2014-06-16 13:31:12
these are the three i've heard of:
  
do your own research on them before investing.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:39:02
woo hoo my first bits!
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:37:35
they aren't meant to stack.  i imagine they will cancel those orders.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:08:11
i don't drink beer, but i do have some mBTC!
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:38:16
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:56:38
i don't care for karma, but i will hang around.  i am a bit obsessed with bitcoin and need to start playing with them asap.  wish i could have mined them, but i didn't know about them then.
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:26:47
Do not go too far.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:49:00
you mean like everyone would want to do when the value of bitcoin goes up a lot?  like it is now.  ain't going to happen.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:58:22
The question is, what happens if a powerful government launches a clone of bitcoin.  Auroracoin isn't relevant, e-dinar isn't relevant, etc.
US gov comes out and says, crypto currency is the future of money.  We have released our crypto currency, you can convert all your monies at usa.gov, we pre mined x monies for ourselves, passed out x monies to our allies, you can mine the rest, run nodes, look at the code, only 21mil will ever exist, etc. (exactly the same as bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-03-30 20:13:12
They are trying to get in before OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:24:16
not if the alt-coin is close source.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:59:48
It was MintChip, but it was nothing like bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-14 04:00:58
What does the purpose of bitcoin have anything to do with a government's motives?
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:46:11
where are you from?  could be a good project for someone to give online spending options for bitcoiners by country.  maybe bitspender.io ppl.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:44:41
or a government puppet
@_date: 2016-01-14 05:09:14
check bitspender.io/cashback
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:25:10
I SOLD ALL MY COINS EVERYONE!
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:40:59
Why is Auroracoin relevant?  It wasn't a government cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:41:10
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:42:13
Oh hai!
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:22:50
probably not a good sign for them
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:33:29
woot, thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:03:53
gold is the paid sub. you get free games (2/month) and unlock online gaming on most games that support it. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:00:32
very cool! can we do this on any other platforms?  edit: does this work globally?
