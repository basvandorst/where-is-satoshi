Go fuck yourself if you think I should have to move my money around for it to still be valid. Money needs to be a store of value and you don't get that if you have to constantly be accessing it.

Netzero was fucking awesome. I could actually play games online for free on our 2nd phone line. The games would cover the netzero overlay so no ads for me. Now I work in the online advertising business and I have to ensure ad viewability. Karma I guess...

I have a weekly buy that initiates on monday early morning. I find that the price usually dips on the weekends likely due to banks being closed. 
I don't really follow too closely what the price is when I buy since I use it as a savings account. I only sell when I have a big sudden expense that isn't typical month to month like insurance or car repair. It sucks when it goes down right before I have to sell but I have been doing it so long it has averaged out and I am definitely in the black.

Do you have a decent guide on what you used to get it going?

Isn't it the other way around? Wouldn't a USER activated soft fork for segwit mean it is what the users want?
