Every time I decide I want to go out to eat, buy something useless or think of another unnecessary way I would normally waste money,  I set it aside &amp; deposit it on GDAX instead. I set a hard price (it was $7550 this week) that I will buy at during that particular week. If it reaches this point I use ~70-80% of what I have stored to buy. I leave some extra small amounts on the exchange at all times in case a true or deep dip occurs, like this past week, so that I can buy then as well. I made the mistake of FOMOing &amp; buying high a few times early on &amp; refuse to do it again. Small &amp; steady, but to the moon I will go!

It didn't end up in my wallet, nor is it in Coinbase. Granted its only ~$2, as a noob, I'm just curious what happened to it.

This does bring up a point I have never seen discussed before (maybe it has, but I’m relatively new to the space). With the amount of bitcoin being set at a hard cap &amp; a lot of it already either lost or inaccessible, how will this affect the currency in the long term, assuming it does gain traction. With people passing away everyday, houses burning down, sending to wrong addresses etc. &amp; connected bitcoin gone forever, would this create an issue? Think of all the USD lost/destroyed every second of the day. If bitcoin does become a world currency a majority of it will simple be lost, I would assume relatively quickly given mass adoption, with no way to replace it.
