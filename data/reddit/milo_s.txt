Agree, although it has no use to get mad about this as it is just smart marketing. He is litterly just using the good name of Bitcoin for profit of his own and he is doing quite a good job with that. Luckly these kind of tricks are from old books as we have experienced many in the past, I just hope that people realise that the internet is not the kind of place where you should just trust anything/anyone blindly ecspecially with money. 
Lets hope that people will wake up!
(Or else, maybe these people will just create another oppertunity to buy more btc at a low price ;) )

NO, ignore. It is a scam. Alot of indian "tech support" is doing the same thing. They scare people by saying all kinds of nonsense to steal ur money. Instal a virus scanner and dubblecheck ur PC and u'll be fine :)

Im not saying this IS an indian tech scam, I am saying only that these kind of things haplen alot an i took indian 'tech' companies as an example. I have nothing against Indian people but you cant deny that there have been alot of incidents in the past couple of years. Im sorry if I have insulted you that was not my intention.

hey, I am a long enthousiast of bitcoin and using Blockchain for my wallet since day 1. I was hoping someone would help me. What should i do with my bitcoins before the fork happens? Because if Blockchain is following the NYA and 2x and all that i would rather not be a part of that because i just feels like an attack...

I think this discussion is not really about why, or that, people hate coinbase and why, or that, some people think it´s great. The way I think you should interpret this point is by looking at what people are focusing on. It may seem like alot of people are hating it because of several reason, but that is from a perspective of the reddit /bitcoin. Most people benefiting from the services of coinbase are just not the type of people to be active on reddit. So as I assume that you are quite active on reddit (/bitcoin) it would be natural to say/think that most people are hating on coinbase.
Perhaps my comment was not the most correct by grammar, but I would like to know if anyone dis-/ agrees?
