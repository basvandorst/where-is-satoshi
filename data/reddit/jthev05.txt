Yep I'm all for taking responsibility over my actions just like any free person in a first world country. If I lose $1000, then so be it. This is hardly different from investing in stocks, and Bitcoin seems to have a future as an online currency. The recent transaction malleability exploit is a setback for sure, but Bitcoin is resilient and I'm confident support will continue to grow. Haters gonna hate.

Or use the money you made to cash out or reinvest as needed. If you have time to day trade then you have time to day trade Bitcoin which is a recent focus on mine. I don't even know why I bother on reddit though since everyone here is a know-it-all. Enjoy your fiat currency.

I bought 1.45 on Coinbase about a half hour ago and plan to buy more when I can afford it. I'm merely suggesting we all stop worrying about the future of Bitcoin regulation and start investing now, but I'm just some "moron" according to hardfork so why listen to me when I'm trying to help people here.
