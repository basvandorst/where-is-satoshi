Why not, the statement says "After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context." =&gt; this would have been the same for deposits made after the hack !
Additionally, usd not lent was not subject to the loss as well, same for eth for instance

Therefore it would seem reasonable to say that it is unlikely we get the website up today, whichever timezone ?

litigation WILL happen within 30 days that any usd depositor requests his money back and they do not pay it.

2000btc traded and most users are still redirected to the funding page and withdraws are disabled, how is this even possible ?

I think in that case cash was also missing, and Japan handled the case.
I also never said I agreed with how mtgox was handled.

Nowhere does it say Bitfinex has to okay the conversion of tokens to shares.

I will choose to disagree with you and agree with my lawyer

USD is money, unlike in US law where crypto isn't. USD not lent out is legally customer money held in safe bank account and can not be used to pay for the risk of crypto holdings which is infinitely higher.

That is not what we are discussing.

IMO usd not lent should not be subject to any haircut as it is safe (in a bank) customer deposit, unlike risky btc holdings. Any usd depositor who requests his deposit usd and does not get it will put you in bankruptcy.

you did not read what he said : "If someone buys 10,000 coins on bitfinex right now, the price would be ~$1020 by the time they buy their last coin."

IF they do a market buy yes, but that would not be very smart and not how smart whales trade.

Logic would dictate that it depends who you want to bet on !

Because this will add a super awesome layer of security : they were even used by the largest usd bitcoin exchange Bitfinex so it must be super mega safe !! ;)
