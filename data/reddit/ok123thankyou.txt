Nearly 90k in donations to him today alone, impressive as fuck.
Bet it will hit 250k soon and he deserves it.
Turning that 250k into 2 million when bitcoin hits 80k a coin or more for his family will set things right for him.
Anyone know of a way to donate directly from paypal to him and not use patreon (have some extra money laying around in it and would like to give him some)?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:07:18
No it is not fair. 10% would be more than fair to pay out of paycheck. Also employers have to pay 14% on top of the wages that the employee never sees. Someone making 20 an hour is actually being paid $23 an hour but they don't even know about the extra $3

Wait, you think money needs to be deposited for the price to rise?
Oh boy :) You are in for a huge fucking shock and really need to educate yourself about investments and assets in general, this has nothing to do with bitcoins.

It was 6000 not 17000.
If someone stole 6000 from you would / should that make you want to cause yourself permanent damage? If someone took $10 from you should that make you want to smash their toe with a hammer? No that makes no sense at all.
Realize you are a human and are programmed to focus and OBSESS on loss. You have evolved to do so and most of the time it serves our species well. In this case it does not serve you well and your wiring is harming you.
* Step 1: Acknowledge the hardwired nature of your brain and its relentless focus on loss even when it is not helpful
* Step 2: Have a goal in mind when investing and identify every possible risk (what if this exchange closes my account? how can I recover from that)
* Step 3: Use your newly found lesson to limit future risk to allow for solid gains in the future
 * Step 4: Realize you are better off then 99% of the people on the planet in terms of opportunity and take advantage of it
    
All that said, it still could work out fine and your coins could become available. The test will be to see if you actually learning anything at all or will you send all your coins to another site.

My contention is that not a single crypto should even attempt to do this. It makes no sense to do so.
Would also be nice to move and update the entire ledger once a year as some sort of snapshot somehow so that the ledger size is reset while keeping the ability to access coins secure. You could always go back and download the old 2016 ledger if you wanted but consensus would be drawn to and applied to the day 1 2017 ledger.

I think that is 100% the way to go.
The side chain can be seen by all participants but the rest of the world does not need to know you bought 2 coffees on Tuesday and only 1 the rest of the week.
I see this as an off chain ledger that people willingly participate in by funding their spending account and their main bitcoins stay in their savings account.
It does require trust of the side chain ecosystem but I am ok with limiting my trust.

Also coinbase has no option to adjust fees, they lock in users at massively high fees and say fuck it.

Short term cap gains tax for the year.
You would record your expenses vs your profits. You spent $1000 and cashed out for $1000. No tax.
Next year when the 2 coins got to $1000 each, you made $1000 and held for a year so LTCG.
Day trading can lead to TONS of taxable events but as long as you have the costs and sales recorded then the net tax is only on the profits. Laughable the IRS only tracks the sales so they assume 100% profit, it is on you to tell them about the costs. Which is funny as fuck because they could easily see both.

A mix of a dozen solid reasons. FOMO, speculation, greed all play their parts but many new people are learning about the tech behind this new way of moving and holding wealth.
They like what they see and have bought in and are happy to hold for years to come.
There are also geopolitical reasons too many to count but one is happening in South Korea which accounts for 14% of all trading volume lately. They are buying into bitcoin because once they are in they can easily access their wealth from anywhere on the planet (anywhere being safer than where they are now). Other countries fiat is crashing so people run to bitcoin to stop the bleeding.
As more and more people adopt the technology the more valuable it becomes. When a handful of people use it, it is only worth fractions of pennies per coin, when you have a billion people wanting and using it, the price has to keep up and the price has.
We are still in the millions of people (maybe 20ish million or less) using it and have a long long growth path ahead. When a billion people want in, the price will reflect that demand. So a rise of 100x or even 200x is still in the cards. Gone are the days of 5000x your investment but that is how risk and reward works. If you wanted coins bad enough 5 years ago, anyone on the entire planet could have got one and even stored it on a paper wallet.

They don't.
The pay a price to buy that contract. Lets say it costs $100 to buy it.
If bitcoin is at 19200 they sell it and make 200 - 100 so a profit of 100 (its all settled in cash actually).
If bitcoin is at 24000 they make 5 grand, if its below 19000 they lose the $100.
That said the price for that contract is most likely a lot lot more than 100, might be 1200 or even 1700.

Don't lose?
If you buy half a stick and the price of sticks doubles you still own half a stick but its value doubled.
If you buy $1000 worth of bitcoin (which is roughly 1/12th of a whole bitcoin) and then bitcoin goes to 24000 per coin you still own 1/12th of a coin but it is now worth 2000 (1/12 of 24000).
The lack of knowledge is scary because it is so basic and has nothing to do with bitcoin. That severe lack of understanding should be a massive red flag for you and should lead you to youtube to research basic investing coupled with basic math. You could choose to be offended by this suggestion and stay in the dark or take it as is and go educate yourself. I highly suggest the later.

You have to move them from coinbase to gdax in the gdax UI
This is where the hand holding ends, the answer is out there, google or youtube it.

Buy from a local willing to sell, good luck though, it will cost at least 12% more than the spot price. I would charge 20% for the added risk.

You know the answer to this...
Lets say there are 1000 words (there are way more).
1000 X 1000 X 1000 X 1000 X 1000.....12 times
What if its 50,000 words times itself times 12 times
What if its 20 different words.
What if its only 300 different words...still want to try?

No crypto should record the purchase of a coffee for ever and ever.
Recording every meal purchased, every movie seen, every toll taken, every gallon of gas for eternity makes zero logical sense.

They got a court order to force coinbase to give up 14k customers records from 2013-2015 and will come after more unless stopped.
That said, simply pay your cap gains tax on your wins and you won't worry about the IRS (be specific on your taxes stating it was from bitcoin/crypto currency trading).

They will try to tell them. Some may listen then others will pop up and become new LNs
From my perspective I like peeling off small chunks of my net worth for daily spending instead of using links to my big chunks. I am 100% in favor of this path we are heading down.
Africa could have a massive AfricaPay LN and when I travel there I simply click Africa on the world map and zap coins to it. I land and can do transactions there instantly. I return and close out and settle up.
Right now it is a nightmare to move fiat around the world and this is easy to see when Korean markets were at 23000 per coin and the rest of the world was at 17000. $5k premium was being paid due to a lack of ability to move fiat easily.

You wrote quite a bit.
 Do you know what very old and crucial problems were solved by the tech behind bitcoin?
That is where the value lies along with being the first on the block and having 1000s of dedicated coders working on the code years later.
    
2. Art does not produce income, gold's main use is a store of value.
3. It is extremely scarce and becoming harder to obtain day by day.
4. You claim people are buying it only because they think it will go up in value. You discount that many want to hedge their bets against fiat (which you love so much) and want to perhaps be in actual control of a scarce object that no government controls.
    
To sum things up, you really have no idea what bitcoin is and still might be right but had you expressed any actual knowledge in that wall of text you would get a moderate bit of respect for not being lazy and refusing to learn about it.

No idea how you sat on the sidelines for over a year watching it rise 20x in value.

There are only various levels of secure.
The most secure being cold storage created via an air gapped never connected or connected in the future pc.
Then use some sort of basic shifting to the private key and store parts of it in various off site locations as well as on site.
    
From that point on it is all worse and worse.

While upset and confused about why this is happening, in the end you will understand the complexity behind each solution and conclude that we are on the right path.
Many new people come along and get frustrated, then learn more and more and understand the nature of the problem and why we all use bitcoin in the first place.
We are here to take part in a decentralized monetary system with no single entity or small group in control of it. The quick dirty fix is to expand the block size which means your tx would get through fast and cheap, the downside...mining becomes more and more consolidated with every block mined. That is not a future I wish to be a part of.

Takes time to transfer and swap into and out of coins.
That time adds to the difference in price due to the friction it creates between markets.

Think for a moment, it still needs to settle on the main chain.
How is that guy going to fund access to a channel with $40 of bitcoin by sending to the channel?

The lack of resistance in place between 20 and 25 is not the norm.
Most times we had chunks along the way but because 20 to 25 is 'only' 25% more there seems to not be as many sell walls as there would be between 15 and 20.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:16:38

More time has been spent attacking the OS for laptops and 70% plus of the phones out there use Android which is somewhat open source and more resilient when attacked by being open to all.

He described an air gapped wallet, which is a step about a permanently connected pc with a wallet on it but still is not cold storage air gapped.

He landed in Paris 8 hours ago and was hit with a wave of donations and messages of support. That donation will change his life completely and enable him to do amazing projects that he enjoys.
Money at these levels really opens up amazing possibilities. Prior to this he was kicking ass without the money, now imagine his levels of kickassedness to come.

not an accountant but yes, you also have to note the full 1800 and the cost of 500 which yields the 1300 taxable result which sounds like a short term gain so at a higher rate.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:04:02
I would bet on yes.

Down to 2600 now.

If you have a 100% trusted friend or family member in SK, email them the private key to a wallet with x value in bitcoins.
Rebuy more here to make up for the loss of coins.
Have them instantly sell the coins then either mail the cash back or have them return it later.

Anyone allowed to purchase and sell need to be able to cover 100% of the position, offering any sort of leverage will cause problems.
Having a market that allows people to hedge loses and gains is not the same as leverage.

Coinbase will be itching to become the next Visa but they would be able to charge way way less. Visa is going to be butthurt which is a good thing because they might lower their fees.

Go hang out in London with a higher murder rate the NYC, or try Sweden as a young woman. good luck not being gang raped and acid thrown in your face.
Keep pretending Europe is not in big trouble loser. I hope you get a up front and personal experience with multiculturalism, you really need your eyes open (ps do not wash your face with water to get the acid off it makes it 10x worse).

I agree we have work to do to remove almost all power out of DC and back to the states, lower taxes is a massive first step along with mass deregulation. Both of these are happening.

Watch out for acid attacks and don't get stabbed!
Nice of you to give away your country you moron, your grandparents would toss you onto the German side during the war for your actions. They sacrifice everything and you call them stupid and give it all away without a fight, pathetic excuse for a bag of skin.

Your father and grandfather are ashamed of your ignorance.

Accepting your premise I get those most in the deal in the country I live in but at times that deals breaks down. It breaks down when the taxation runs amok like now and when non citizens can walk in and take all of the good without putting anything in.

Then you have never lived in a corrupt third world nation, war torn and devoid of basic human rights.
When you are part of a first world nation you can easily lose sight of how amazing a society you are a part of and how easily it can be lost to darkness.

Justice and Fairness make for a great society, too few in those societies take those aspects for granted. They have no clue just how horrible life can become and have no idea how much hard work, sweat and blood has been laid down to build such a society.
You want to come here and share in it? Get in line, have merit, be educated and be able to contribute on day one.

I am a huge fan of borders and nations, finance on the other hand should be less controlled by the banking elite.
Taxation is needed but WAY out of hand (should be half or less what it is in the US currently).
