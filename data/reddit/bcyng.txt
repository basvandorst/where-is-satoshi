Hear u there. Also got goxxed. It’s probably safer in the Japanese courts than the alternatives at the time. Even though we will loose 80% of it. I’m pretty sure I would have lost all of it if I left it on my laptop. Don’t even know the private keys for any of the wallets I setup around that time.

We lost 80% because the remaining assets even though they have increased in value are only about 20% of what we are owed.

bank transfers are free in the modern banking system in most countries regardless of the size of the transaction. Transfers that cost money are the exception rather than the rule (eg international wire transfers, bank cheque’s etc.).

Less than $2.38 (free) and in many countries outside the US less than 15mins (instant - a few sec).... compared with using the modern banking system, transaction fees and time is not one of bitcoins advantages.

A distributed file system is one example, a chat application using block chain is another. Block chain can be used without value tokens being exchanged. A single person (or maybe an army or company) might want to use block chain to backup data across multiple sites and have no other participants in the network other than his own nodes. You could even run the internet (though it wouldn’t be very scalable with the current tech) on it.
It really comes down to how u define value tokens - u could define it really broadly where it’s a piece of data and say that all data has value. But blockchain doesn’t require the token/data to have value. It could be useless. In fact this is one of the arguments about bitcoin in general. The non-believers believe it has no value. If that’s true it could well go to zero. But even if that’s the case and people leave their nodes running, it’s still a blockchain.
Defining blockchain like this takes a very narrow view and misses out its potential.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:40:52
Based on this u r now defining value tokens/coins as pieces of data with or without value. If that’s the case I can agree with u. Though by that logic u could say a linked list or basically any data structure requires coins/tokens. 
The block chain is a distributed ledger. It could be recording asset transfers but it could also be (and is) recording chat messages, locations of file system blocks, change logs, file system journal entries, events in history. There are advantages to this approach over other methods.

How so? Taxes are generally a percentage of something. 20% of fiat or crypto is still 20%. And if you refuse there is a bullet or tank or missile coming your way...

In the example of a chat application. U write a message to the blockchain ledger, the receivers of the message then read the block chain to get the messages in the right order. 
In a database/filesystem. The reads and writes are written to the blockchain. The blockchain manages the ordering and validation of the reads and writes to maintain consistency. 
Here are a few examples from a quick google search where it’s being done/discussed without coins

Volatility refers to the degree of variation over time. Mean is largely irrelevant.
Yes within a country volatility doesn’t really matter. If everyone is using the same currency then there is effectively no volatility. This is true for whatever currency u use (fiat, crypto, gold etc).

They said something along the lines of “we intend to keep the supply of btc to a max of 21 million”. The fed makes similar decisions about the scarcity of the USD through the money supply. They have said the transaction fee will be based on market forces. These are all policy decisions. The miners are basically the equivalent of the reserve board. You have to get the board to agree on every change, every rule. There is a clear voting/decision process in both cases.
U point out the volatility of btc. Going back to the Zimbabwe dollar example - 79 billion percent (790000000x) in one month! Fiat has the same (worse?) volatility issues.
As others have pointed out, the market is still working out the value of bitcoin, it’s pretty normal for new securities/assets/currencies to go through a period of greater volatility while the market determines its value. The money market for fiat does the same any time a big even occurs - have a look what happened to the USD in the few hours and days after trump got elected.

You mean like India just banned bitcoin and China is on their way? Unless it’s banned every where then it still survives. Any fiat is just as vulnerable to the law (made by someone with bigger guns), crypto and fiat have the same vulnerability in that respect. India recently banned large denomination physical fiat currency. Iran just banned the USD. It’s hardly immune from this.
Yes there are many ways of enforcing the law, but fundamentally all those ways are eventually enforced by weapons. Sure u can send the police, u can fine people, economic sanctions, but ultimately u are enforcing it with bigger guns (eg swat teams, nukes etc). See North Korea or the second world war as an example (conquered Japanese territories were using Japanese currency until the bigger guns stopped that, North Korea is basically ignoring the us institutions and us law and enforcement and they can because they have big guns/nukes). For the guy on the street, he can ignore the laws if he wants, u can send him fines and nasty words but ultimately the only thing keeping him in his place is that eventually the govt will send someone with a bigger gun than his to enforce it (usually the police).
The monetary policy for bitcoin is very clear there are 21 million and that’s it, any changes have to be agreed by 51% of the miners. Bitcoin is deflationary but not all crypto is. There are cryptos that are inflationary like the USD. There are even cryptos that are tied to the usd. Hodl is more relevant for deflationary cryptos. That really comes down to the monetary policy of the individual crypto.
Iran in fact is moving towards its currency being crypto. Chile has basically already done it with petroleum dollars. These crypto are already backed by guns and government institutions. Really the only difference between these crypto and fiat is the implementation technology. 
As far as intrinsic value and value vanishing, both fiat and crypto have similar vulnerabilities. Though it could be argued that crypto at scale actually is a bit more resilient than fiat because for decentralised crypto you can’t just take out one entity to stop it, you have to take out all of them.
lacking perspective on volatility? Just look at the fx rate data. The major fiat currencies are so volatile that financial institutions have to pass on large fx spreads to consumers. The volatility of fiat is actually one of the reasons for crypto and why international transfers in fiat are so expensive. It’s also one reason why most major banks are evaluating it in some way or another. The volatility argument against crypto has zero basis.

Some good points here. I suppose it depends on the type and extent of collapse. There are a number of examples recently where the collapse of a country’s economy or currency resulted in a surge in bitcoin usage and value - Zimbabwe, Venezuela etc. Total world-wide collapse of infrastructure world-wide (ie walking dead) however would probably lead to the situation u are describing.

Digital currencies don’t need to be fixed supply. There are a number of coins which are inflationary. There is actually no reason why they couldn’t replicate fiat mechanisms. The point was that fiat fundamentally doesn’t have anything that makes it better than crypto. Zimbabwe’s currency turned out to be worthless too. You could back crypto with guns and it would have all the properties of fiat (well except the paper part), plus more. It’s just a technology and like fiat it’s only as valuable as it is accepted or desired. Zimbabwe ended up using usd. The Zimbabwe dollar fiat is has no intrinsic value because no one accepts it anymore - well except for investment bankers buying up its high denomination notes for its collectors value.

No, the USD actually does change in value second by second. You can see this yourself at  or any forex exchange. In 1 year it dropped ~25% vs the EUR, AUD etc. same against the JPY, then back up a few months later. The prices denominated in Zimbabwe dollars increased 79 billion percent in one month (more volatility than any crypto ever). Freely floated fiat currencies such as the USD are very volatile.
The only difference between modern fiat and crypto is that successful fiat are backed by guns. Guns, tanks, bombers are the only thing that what gives them any more value than crypto. Other than that it’s usage acceptance and controlled scarcity - both have that. We saw in the case of Zimbabwe dollar that fiat is just as worthless as crypto if people stop accepting/using it.
Just as with crypto, anyone can create a new fiat currency. Microstates do this all the time. Their currencies have little value because few people accept them. Just as failed crypto currencies have no value because no one accepts them.
I don’t challenge that currently fiat currencies issued by a stable power are currently superior to commodities. Whether it will be superior in the future to crypto is still up for debate - hopefully we will live long enough to see. I’ll bet that central banks will start using crypto and countries will eventually back it with guns. At that point it’s really no different to fiat.

The USD is only not volatile to Americans. To everyone else is volatile as fk.
The US did a brilliant coup, they convinced everyone to give them all their gold (something with actual value) in return for pieces of paper and IOU’s.

So it’s backed by itself ��‍♂️ (and laws enforced with guns)...
