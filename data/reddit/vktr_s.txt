I'd say the most prevalent opinion is that \*most should be able to\* run a full node. Not that everyone \*must\*. I want to run a full node because without running one I can't really make use of Bitcoin's "smart contract" features. I can't be sure miners aren't inflating the supply and I have to trust ppl with datacenters to relay my tx and preserve my privacy.
Bitcoin to me is about individual sovereignty, privacy, fixed supply and minimizing the need for externalized trust. Other coins just don't compare...

People  use bcash in the same way that people use dogecoin. However, on most days, they use dogecoin more[^(\[1\])](

A series of web standard conforming smilies can be used with a base\ encoding.
A custom smiley image file could contain a steganographicaly hidden TX.
Can't think of anything else with smilies

They handed user info over without a warrant. Deleted my account the day the news broke that bitcoin(dot)de doesn't care about its users privacy.

No need to fix anything. Just define hashrate to contain all cost associated with it.

If half the miners left tomorrow that wouldn't change a thing for the remaining miners. One miner's profits are not dependent on other miners. Profit is a function of difficulty, Bitcoin price and the hashrate you own. Sure, the time interval between blocks would increase. However BTC has a healthy fee market, meaning the remaining miners would see increased profit. Once difficulty readjusts miners would see an even greater bitcoin return.
  
Current price and speculation about future price determines hashrate. To claim that hashrate determines price, is to display a staggering inability to comprehend the most basic cause and effect relationships. Though I am not surprised that it's predominantly economists that come up with such asinine ideas.

Well 1.4B come from China. Crypto will never replace wepay there. The west is so ensnared in its individualism and freedom loving that it can't comprehend the level of collectivism and successful state control in China. Moving behind the great firewall literally feels like entering an alternate universe.
