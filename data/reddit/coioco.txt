tl;dr "yes, I'm asking my users to pay for the luxury of debugging for me. Please stop bringing it up."

You are pretty clearly amateur hour, so I 110% don't buy your service as 'secure' for even a second. For christ's sake this is actually on your webpage:




Seriously, you can't figure how *debugging* works, you **beg users to pay for the luxury of debugging for you**, and you want me to believe you have any idea what you're doing? Haha, no.

Solid scam you got going here, bud.

You mean you can't arbitrarily lynch people you don't like? Damn gubbermint!

Hey, aren't you that guy who is literally a paid shill for that user data / PII vacuum / failing company known as changetip?

Oh yeah, and by the way, pointing out that you are, in fact, a crude amateur and thus people shouldn't use your shitty service isn't an 'ad hominem'. That's common sense.
For future reference, an ad hominem would be something like "this coinado guy is a faggot therefore don't use his terrible product". In that case, the insult has nothing to do with the conclusion. You being an amateur has everything to do with the conclusion.
