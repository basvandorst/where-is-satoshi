Oh look.  The US woke up and the $400-$500 uptick we had overnight has evaporated.  Just awesome.

I was expecting worse than what we've seen today.  Seems like no big deal so far.

Bitcoin basically just extended it's middle finger at the CME futures short-seller dump.  Maybe it'll slow down this garbage for a while.

One question I have is, where does the money (fiat) go when I purchase bitcoin?  
Common sense says my fiat ultimately ends up in the hands (or bank accounts) of a miner or a holder who decided to sell.  This means that there's literally no 'store of value'...which is ironic, since that's exactly what many tout bitcoin to be.
If everyone decided to sell, the only possible way to recover fiat would be if others wanted to buy bitcoin.  While a wide-scale selloff seems unlikely at this point in time, it is nevertheless an unnerving reality.
Anyway, I guess I've answered my own question.

Oh, I understand perfectly well...
 
1. There's the true-believer, change-the-world, stick-it-to-the-man crowd.  The *truly authentic* members of this group make up a microscopic fraction of people who currently own bitcoin.  
1. There's the group who bought in *so low* and are sitting on *so much value*, that they get to play bitcoin evangelist.  This is another tiny subset
1. There's the group who *claim* to be part of the true-believer crowd, but are actually in it for the lambos.  You can find a lot of these folks right here in 1. There's the group who are purely in it for the lambos &amp; couldn't care less about the 'deep underlying meaning of it all'.  This is **by far** the largest segment of the average-joe-individual-bitcoin-buyer crowd over the last 12 months
1. Finally, you've got your whales and your seriously schooled day traders.  They're like group 4, but smarter &amp; have more money.  They're the ones moving the market while everyone in this sub wonders what the hell's going on
Yea, that looks about right.  There's the FOMO crowd as well, but you can basically lump them into group 4
