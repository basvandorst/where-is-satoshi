I feel like Mt Gox's death is a lot like this ..

Sadly, no, it's not. It's a Lamassu, which is a Bitcoin vending machine that only allows you to buy bitcoins.

Watch this and you'll think differently ...

An ATM is a bi-directional machine that can buy and sell Bitcoin (like how a normal ATM functions ..cash-in and cash-out). A vending machine is only 1-way (like how a typical vending machine works ... you receive something for money), so TechCrunch is not wrong.

Yeah, I would not trust this because of this: "Because these conditions are persistent, the Nymi will learn the 
condition and include it as part of the user’s biometric template". That suggests that a person is always born with a heart condition that never worsens. I have a heart condition and the first thing they do when I go to the doctor is always run an ECG to see if it has changed (signal of a worsening condition).

They pay you over time, so it's not $10,000 up front.

The guy purposefully does not include a miners fee in his transaction ... check it out @ 12:12. That's not the machine, that's just bitcoin 101.

"Bitcoin nodes only use DNS once on their first startup to get peer IP list." ... The same argument can be made when going to a website. Once DNS is resolved the first time you go to it, it is cached. I was also able to still use a ton of websites by just having friends who could resolve domains, give me the IP addresses of hosts and override them in my /etc/hosts file. This isn't something special to bitcoin.
