What bank are you with? Not many banks will penalise you for simply buying Bitcoins, even the occasional small sale should be ok as long as you're not making a business out of it.

Can you remember the name of that MP3 download service? I'm curious, never heard of anything like that (well, except Amazon's Autorip).

And for a business like his, it's also running an unlicensed bank.

It is possible to turn off the trollbox.

Yeah, what about just reuploading the forum with all emails + passwords changed to garbage? No incentive for anyone to hack it, but everyone can still read posts, and your Google rankings don't get destroyed.

12% if you don't pay it back due to not being able to manage your money. Otherwise, 0%.

Switch to vbulletin, SMF regularly seems to have problems like this.
Now, where's my 50 BTC? :D
EDIT: Should add, no offence meant to SMF, you seem like good guys who know what they're talking about (and I've used SMF in the past) - it's just software that's paid for and so can afford full time staff, plus has a much bigger userbase, is naturally gonna have less bugs.

In before they do the same thing we did with Pokemon cards, and start photocopying them.

Why not tell him to practice first, not with real bitcoins, just writing down the exact time he'd buy, and the exact time he'd sell, as he decides it? That way he's not risking anything, but still practicing. He reminds me of myself a lot at that age, I wish my parents had let me trade stocks (with my own money of course)

Depends, not all loans are bad, I've used my credit card for cash advances a ton of times - sure it's 3%, but when you can easily make that back on the money borrowed within a day, it's worth it.

Why not try LocalBitcoins? That way you don't need to bother with international transfers, you just send a transfer to someone else in the US.
**Not a localbitcoins shill, just discovered the light a couple of months ago)

May be worth mentioning it again, often when a parent says no to something, you think that's the end of it.
Does he have a Litecoin wallet? Diversification is always good, throw an address over :)
