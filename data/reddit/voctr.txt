I'm just in before Monday ends here in Europe, hopefully someone can answer my question.
A lot of people are talking about keeping paper wallets and trying to secure their coins. This has gotten me thinking about the exchanges. I'm currently in the process of verifying with Bitstamp and was wondering whether or not it's necessary to back up something or send the bitcoins to a different wallet after buying on there.. Are they safe there or do I need to move them?
Hope my question isn't too stupid. I can't wait to buy some coins!

There are a lot of tools out there to create a live linux usb, such as my first google result: 
You get the distro u want, put it together with this tool and voila you're done.

How quick is it to move coins from my wallet to the exchange? And what software would you recommend to keep my own offline wallet?

How likely is it an exchange like Bitstamp would get hacked?
If I understand correctly the private keys are equal to the # of bitcoins they represent? So is it possible to just have these private keys and add/take them from online wallets like blockchain (thats where I currently have a wallet with some odd cents I received in this subreddit)?

So I have a question for you guys. Is it true that say I lose my wallet because a hard drive crashed, these bitcoins would vanish from the supply forever and would never be recovered or mined back? Does that mean that someone could theoretically destroy all bitcoins?

So having a paper wallet is the same as 'cold storage'?
And how does it work, do you write down the two keys you see there (public) and (private) and then send all your bitcoins to the (public) key to store them in the (private) key?
Is it possible to check if they arrived without compromising its security?

No the amount you have doesn't change as the amount of bitcoins in your possession stays the same, it's just a different denomination. It's like going from $1 to 100 dollar cents. Still is 1 dollar just like 1000mBtc is still 1 BTC
