Joe is moolah investor [proof] (

Do you still have faith after [the recent developments](
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:15:27
Interesting. You were also fast to comment in the very first post questioning moolah atms back in January 
some even thought you might be his alt or vice versa
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:08:24
It is nothing personal. I just think it is an important fact that should be disclosed. All the best.
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:35:24
Do you still think ATMs are legit [after this post](
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:16:11
are you moolah investor?
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:28:10
When you go back to your comments from January and look at the promises made by moolah whom you defended and asked to give him a chance to prove that he will deliver the product as promised. can you honestly say that there is nothing wrong and suspicious about how the ATM development was handled? 
I think you also mentioned that you were planing to invest in moolah, so please correct me if I am wrong but I will assume you are an investor.
*edit: spelling

You forgot to mention that you have invested in moolah.io [proof]
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:12:34
Thank you, it is fair, I think if every investor did add a disclosure in posts related to moolah.io it would add that extra bit of credibility to the discussion.
As I said you have all the rights to protect and recommend the business you have invested your hard earned money into but I think the readers deserve to be informed about your connection with it. 
Again all the best and I hope all works well for you.

Joe seems to be a decent guy, it is just he may be a bit biased on moolah as he is one of the investors, [proof](  It is perfectly normal that he tries to protect the company he has invested in but I think he should add some sort of disclosure to his comments.

a valid opinion, but does not explain his blog posts 


* Our enclosure is en route, you’ll be seeing a video in the very near future and we’ll be shipping the first couple of units! [(Feb 5 2014)](/
* ATM Units, They’re ready to go. Big blog post coming shortly. [(Mar 6 2014)](
* On the physical product side of things, the first of our ATM units are ready to ship. **There’s a couple boxed up** and they’ll be going out to a few lucky people. We’ll be continuing to ship these on a regular basis. 
[(Mar 17 2014)](
and the fact that he admitted to *fucking up* only when confronted publicly by an investor

I hope you get your money back not just "what is your ticket number?" reply

No sign of Moolah ATMs - 3 months since the original deadline and 3 days after "we are confident to deliver by that date" deadline
