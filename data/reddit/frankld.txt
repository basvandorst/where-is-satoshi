What ever you do, use Multi-signature. Electrum, Coinkite and Coinb.in are all good options.

Repost I know, but this needs more attention.

@_date: 2014-12-08 18:22:06
Added, thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:07:10
For which features?
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:19:53
Because they are banks, and their motives are not aligned with Bitcoin; Privacy, independence and security by cryptography. Those companies offer IOUs.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:29:29
If you care about privacy you don't use Coinbase, they are a bank, they do AML/KYC and hold your data for up to 5 years.
Their shills will be here in a couple min downvoting me.

**A good place to start with securing bitcoin is [this post]( from a few days ago. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:02:07
1. Not that we know
2. Major fuckup (it was like not having any clue how cryptography work)
3. Supposedly, can't trust them anymore.
4. It was discovered a few days ago.
Please read this post about multi-signature 
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:35:45
What about Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:05:41
Do you work for them? You keep on saying that on all their posts.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:45:12
I hope their retirement money is not on subprime like in Japan. They should buy all the Bitcoin they can with the spare cash!

Besides being a stupid concept the privacy is shit, they require real name.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:41:50
All the wallets listed above support BIP32 addresses and unlike Coinbase/Circle don't require any real identity.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:01:32
Added a note.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:25:03
You are a bank.
Coinbase does not offer reasonable privacy, you require full name and email for account creation and retain the information for up to 5 years.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:58:05
Nice development, I'm really liking it. I can't seem to be able to put in hd xpubkeys, I keep on getting errors.

They could if they had access to more than 2 keys if 2/3.

@_date: 2014-12-08 18:39:41
Correct, the most secure way is to generate keys offline and sign offline. But multisig is a massive improvement over just one key on blockchain.info or a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:40:17
Also Xapo doesn't have real insurance.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:28:22
I don't see that option on the website, please let me know where.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:43:33
 You don't own the Bitcoin on Coinbase/Circle. Don't use them, no privacy as they are banks.

Any of these support it with some good level of privacy:

- [Coinkite]( Multiple key options (m-of-1/15) and lets you create the keys offline.
- [Copay]( Free/Open source, multiple key options, you have to host it for full security.

I don't disagree, but you would be surprised with how many people use exchanges as their wallets.

Then just generate extra keys with the offline tool, print their PDF securely and store on a safe deposit box, when you die they will get access. Leave instructions.

That's what happens to startups, most close shop. There are too many in this space for the market size.
Same comment I made on the other post. You always could send Bitcoin via SMS with [Coinbase]( or [Coinkite]( I think Circle also offers that too.

Good read that's such a good feature, I've been mugged before and this would definitely help when these bad guys catch up with Bitcoin. I love Breadwallet, which I use it, but I cannot agree with storing more than daily spending amounts in wallets that are not mult-signature. The single point of failure is not acceptable (not just for theft but also bad backup, loss, etc...).
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:04:00
Sure, multi-signature allows you to have multiple private keys per wallet, and you choose the rules. Standard wallets only have one private key and one signature. With multi-signature you can setup so that it need for example 2 signatures out of 3 keys, that means its harder for an attacker or you to lose keys all those keys.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:54:41
That's still a single key, to store my bitcoin savings and operational capital I use multi-signature on Coinkite offline key generator and with Ledger to co-sign, all keys backed up in Armory Lockbox. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:49:29
Mycelium is a fine wallet, but for long term or larger amount **IMHO must use multi-signature.** You can do that with Electrum, Coinkite or Armory.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:51:28
I'd go with Electrum (desktop) or Coinkite (web/offline), I know they don't have an app but great wallets. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:36:18
I think that if you use tor, and make sure not to re-use addresses you will be fine. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:04:53
I prefer ledger, it's much cheaper  and it supports mult-signature.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:52:28
IMHO, for anything you can't afford to lose use multsig signature with Coinkite or Electrum. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:09:28
This is old
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:44:35
Multi-signature is great, the problem is you are messing around with unfinished tools and will end up with your money stuck once UTXOs get more complex.
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:43:37
Multisig is fantastic, use it today, but use tools that are constantly being updated; Armory, Coinkite, etc... 
Managing multisig scripts by yourself is stupid, and will cause great financial pain. 
I'm a big advocate for multisig

Thanks, I said don't store on Coinbase, other wise great place to buy/sell. I know they have to comply, but I cannot suggest to people to use their vault. Because despite the multisig, people are still exposed to Coinbase's tracking/reporting and all around complete lack of privacy.

1. Cold storage means the medium holding the private keys is completely offline. ("Not accessible to hackers or viruses")
2. In a nutshell, they can't be infected with viruses or be tampered. They are piratically cold storage.
3. It's cold storage, because the paper can't connect to the internet. The words are an easier way for you to remember than a hexadecimal string.
4. This means what you said, making sure you are not holding all your money in the same place. If one fails you don't lose everything.

Here are some better alternatives:
Use Multisig (for large amounts and anything more than pocket money):
- [Armory]( Open Source, lots of features, full node, multiple key options (15), very secure and very complicated. (API, Offline and Self Contained)
- [Coinkite]( Multiple key options (15), lots of features, notifications, easy and lets you create the keys offline. (API, Offline, Web and Tor)
- [Electrum]( Open source, workhorse, basic reliable features, native desktop, multiple key options (15). (Trusted Servers and Tor)
- [Coinb.in]( Open Source, very bare but reliable. (Web)
Other wallets (for pocket money, easy to spend on the go):
- [Bitcoin Wallet]( Basic wallet app, notifications. Good for small amounts on Android and BB
- [BreadWallet]( Basic wallet app, notifications. Good for small amounts on iOS (re-added to my list after bugs fixed) 
- [Mycelium]( Basic wallet app, notifications. Good for small amounts on Android (re-added to my list after bugs fixed)
Also consider hardware wallets:
- [Ledger]( is great and cheap.
Block explorers:
- [Blocktrail]( 
- [Blockr](
- [Block Explorer (.com)](
- [Toshi.io (API only)](
Note: *Why only the above? First, I have had enough time to test them. Second, they have been around for long enough and never were hacked or had major bugs resulting in users losses.*
Amounts: *Make sure you use multi-signature for any amount you can't afford to lose. Don't put more than spending amounts on phone app wallets. Hardware wallets are also great, but make sure you back them up.*
Warning: *Under NO circumstances store bitcoin on: blockchain.info, coinbase, installwalet, bips.me, xapo, circle or any exchange. These either lost money or you don't own your bitcoin.*

You should use both, setup Ledger with multisignature (i.e 2 of 4) on Electrum or Coinkite, backup the extra 2 keys offline. Then when you want to spend you have to use Ledger to co-sign. You can also use it as the single key on Mycelium.
