Mt Gox has a target on its back by the powers that be. Without Mt Gox running cover for other exchanges to go and develop, Bitstamp would be next. It's divide and conquer. Just use the same playback for the next biggest exchange until the next technical problem appears.
I don't believe Mt Gox relaxed and went to fractional reserve after they had millions confiscated by FinCEN. They should still be on guard. I don't like how they don't communicate but then again, if the most powerful government wants me dead I might be like that. From what I have seen Mt Gox has acted with integrity and they endure. And I hope the core bitcoin people work together to get this problem resolved. Even if my bitcoins are not at Mt Gox, I'm eagerly waiting too.

The deflationary argument has been debated to death on this subreddit and I'm tired of it. I am voting by buying bitcoins in exchange for my fiat currency. Businesses will still employ people. I eat, buy clothes and see the doctor regardless of what kind of money I have.

I assume you're using the bitcoin-qt wallet. In that case, there are many "dust transactions" that were sent to your wallet such that sending an amount like 0.0008 would incur a fee of 0.0003 btc. By default, the transaction fee is 0.0001 in bitcoin-qt.
I guess the developers have tweaked it so the minimum tx fee corresponds to how many transactions that have to be  summed up to send it. At 0.0009 your wallet suggests a fee of 0.0002, which is smaller than the fee of sending 0.0008 because fewer transactions had to make up the 0.0009 compared with more transactions that had to make up 0.0008 in your wallet. That would explain the difference.

It's got important social innovations like a curse-free, feel good interactions that can begin to shape the values of its members, including of course, going to the moon.
For eg, I see when r/dogecoin strays into bitcoin/alt coin bashing, someone stands up to say we don't compare and make others feel less that's not what we stand for. And fellow shibes upvote them. r/bitcoin can learn from its younger sibling, including not making each other feel less in their own community because others got in first.
And there are those in r/dogecoin who advocate changing the concept of money from private ownership to "public" ownership thru constant private tipping and trust the community karma to refill one's wallet. Such an idea would be... wow! Dogecoin is like a fractal of bitcoin which is a fractal of fiat. Dogecoin is like the yin and bitcoin is like yang. The creators of dogecoin haven't decided if 100 billion would be the final limit. They also don't know what effect random block rewards has on the decentralization of mining and most importantly, the security that bitcoin has. Still, dogecoin's advantage is it can be flexible and an enormous quantity used in many ways on the internet the shibes will surely show. Very trend! Wow!
I see how bitcoin and dogecoin can work together for people to transition from fiat to bitcoin, then from the idea of private money in itself into community wealth. Such memes very experiment!
EDIT: Moon

FDIC and fraud security are separate issues. FDIC protects bank depositors from bank failures, although the banks are so TBTF that only the government by ordering the FED to print cash *might* the people get their money back, which is the danger we want to avoid by being in bitcoins. But yes, bitcoiners will have more responsibility in the new system because we'll have more power over our own money.
For fraud, there are decentralized arbitration services. I know r/themarketplace is using such a system but there is another one from a few days ago announced on r/bitcoin. It can replace credit cards on those occasions where fraud and service issues, between buyers and sellers, are a problem. There is a need for such a service and is being developed.

Not really worried about the fund managers. Just like banks have to change the way they do business, individuals will have to take more responsibility for the security and flexibility their bitcoins offer. The institutional fund managers just try to beat the S&amp;P 500 index, which most can't do anyway, because of their salaries and expenses. 
Pension funds are meant to yield returns as to outgrow the cost of living. Bitcoin solves that by with its constant purchasing power over time. Anyone can plug an actuary formula and figure out how many years they have left. Besides, how many Detroits are there going to be where the city goes bankrupt and decades of counting on promises ends up with a judge? I'd rather count on my own promises. 
Edit: I've heard Social Security doesn't have many years left...

I hope not I have a lot invested in bitcoin. That's why I don't want to see Mt Gox fail after being battle-tested. People don't give credit that Mt Gox runs the cover and lets other exchanges go and develop. The state captured regulators and the banks can apply the same bag of tricks on Bitstamp as they're doing on Mt Gox (for eg making it difficult to withdraw dollars). It's divide and conquer.

I think you have to attack the income disparity argument head on. The fact is Satoshi himself has more money than Bill Gates and Warren Buffett put together, even more than the entire US. But you can still make a good case that you can't extrapolate the current meaning of income disparity to the vision of global bitcoin adoption.
As an example, look how much easier retirement planning would be for bitcoin because the average person never has to worry about investing again.  As long as they can stick to their budget they can predictably know how much to save each year. Throw out the 401k's, index funds, emerging market bonds, currency baskets, etc. Save yourself the headache and make life simpler. Unlike the current income parity situation where everyone, rich or not, has to run the investment treadmill, not knowing when the market is going uphill or downhill.

No, for eg when the Iraq War happened, the US government used a slight of hand called debt. Bush made it so American could have guns and butter, to keep the economy going by borrowing money, but it's temporary, because sooner or later we have to pay it back, like now with the never ending recession and the budget crises. Then later, the Fed printed cash so we're so deep into the con game that the only option they have is to keep QE going and hiding inflation in our lives. But with bitcoin in control, governments will be running on a much shorter leash, or greatly made over. There's no borrowing of bitcoins unless the population actively supports the government effort, because groups of powerful business interests cannot hijack the government for their special interests then fire up the war machine to get out their predicaments. Had Bush said cut the US GDP by 5% per year as a war effort; imagine a 5% salary cut in real terms (as bitcoin would function), for every American, the war wouldn't have happened.


I believe the Fed doesn't have a choice now. They can either stop QE, let go of life support for the TBTF banks and we'll have a bigger hole in the banks than 2008, which means like the Great Depression, people literally could not get their hands on dollars, which means bitcoin would automatically replace the dollar. The owners of this country (businesses and the power elites) would not let that happen, so I believe they must announce QE 4 soon. This means faster US dollar inflation, but would buy the owners some time to figure out how they ended up so off course as masters of the universe, before they disappear with a whimper. It would give regular Americans time to adopt bitcoins. No matter what, massive changes are coming soon regardless.


Peace is a natural instinct. Doesn't have to be taught. People are attracted to it like a fragrance. Look at the Pope and his message of peace. It may take some people a while to get out of entrenched inter-history struggles of tribe against tribe, but the threads can be unwound. We can stop threading new ones by making nuke disarmament a public stance, that's so easily communicated personally and the benefits are quickly realized. In bitcoin terms, peace is surfing bitcoin's network effects. The battle lines in this human evolution of consciousness are drawn right here online in conversations. Like an awareness that goes into the electric ether, it becomes a nervous system that coordinates a future that is becoming more whole. Like bitcoin ties all nations in closer economic, political and social relationships, until the vision is clear and understood, so it becomes automatic when people talk of nuke disarmament and peace. When we hear that kind of music, it will be echoes of our conversation that are the fractals of others' conversations amplified on the same wave. Peace was always humanity's destiny.

And if policy makers are deciding whether to add another nuke to their arsenal, the answer from the world bitcoin community is if it's possible to be used, then no. In fact, they should disarm and destroy all nukes. After that, they should resign. Help save money to use on universal healthcare or something.

Sorry I meant Ripple was the currency sponsored by Google and was trying to beat out bitcoin but ended up nowhere, so far. Bitstamp was 1 of the first big partners of making Google's system work by being a "gateway" which allows consumers to wire money to the exchange then make fees as a middleman to pass the money into Google's closed system. Google wanted all users to use their centralized wallet system, which was against the principle of decentralized p2p currency. 
Despite being a dead-end, Bitstamp inexplicably still lets the 10 users still left to keep Ripple on their exchange. But make no mistake, Ripple is  once bitcoin falls. Win win for both companies.

For eg you can look at  for the hottest threads on bitcointalk in the last 24 hrs.

The longer the better because they've been involved with bitcoins when it was much cheaper.
Or look at friedcat's (the owner of AsicMiner) company thread at ["ASICMINER: Entering the Future of ASIC Mining by Inventing It"]( You'll see the "old timers" like Jutarul, DeadTerra, and especially ThickAsThieves. ThickAsThieves is into all the financing and helped bring out Neo Bee, the new bitcoin bank in Cyprus.

Yup. But bitcoin is only part of the story of 2012, though an important part of taking away the fear of survival, so that world peace is possible. The bitcoin community's self interest in abolishing nuclear bombs guarantees that a city's communication infrastructure won't get demolished so our bitcoins don't become instantly unusable, so even if the target is not us, it would tank our wealth in bitcoins.
Self-interest happens to coincide with public interest. Beautiful thing.

I think you have the best of intentions for wanting to help people and improve the world. There's always different stories to what you're seeing play out in reality. Is humanitarian aid always good or is it a part of soft power combined with hard power to achieve US power? At the same time the US merges aid organizations with civilians so you can't tell the influence comes the government.
In the case of Ukraine, the EU and Russia were working out a deal when that Nuland diplomat said "Fuck the EU," making me suspect that US wanted this crisis because they wanted to get Russia back (during the Sochi Olympics) for US looking stupid on Syria and Iran, in the midst of all the other failures of the American empire falling apart. Now Putin called Obama's bluff and US is even worse off. It would've happened anyway but it didn't have to be bumbling like this. Instead, Obama doubles down, loses like idiots and all his supporters and organizations have to do the same. That's getting caught up in someone else's quarrels.
Someone once said take back your own space. That means your own physical space, financial space, relationship space, etc. You can improve the world by volunteering and taking care of your own community. Do that as best as we can and the karma spirals out onto the world.

Sorry no they're one and the same. When you choose to encrypt you are required to enter a password and that's what I meant. Once you've chosen encryption, your wallet.dat file is scrambled on the hard drive, and that means you can't send out bitcoins unless you have the password. So, there's no need to do an encrypted backup of wallet.dat after that.  Just save it on a thumb drive and you're done.  Yes you only need the passphrase and wallet.dat.

The first thing you said was "John Lothian is correct" without noting that the first thing he said according to the OP was that criminals use it. That's an inaccurate general statement on bitcoin.  Most bitcoiners are definitely NOT criminals.  Then Lothian goes on to say (according to the OP) that "bitcoins are associated with thieves."  Maybe in his reality and in yours that's true, but not in mine.  Then you emphasized it by saying Lothian's "thoughts on bitcoin are correct."  I disagree.

I think the "wealth shift" is not a zero sum game. Even the last group of people to convert will reap the benefits of no inflation forever. Besides I have a feeling the last group of people to convert will be the ones with the most to lose from changing the current system, people who are the wealthy elites of the world. If their wealth gets halved or quartered it's still more money then most ppl can dream of.
As for techies, check out this article about how millions of people in [Kenya and Somaliland are already using mobile digital currencies instead of cash.](  They understand the idea very well and would have no problems with the new Kipochi bitcoin wallet from Kenya.

For someone new to bitcoins, getting such treatment is a shock. Their tech support is polite but extremely unhelpful. Their standard form answers just add to the aggravation. They need to get their act together and stop taking their customers for granted. Only when I emailed 1 of the owners, Charlie Schrem, were my problems resolved, and almost instantly. It's as the rest of their customer support is absolutely useless. And -1000 points for the rep called URSAY.

This is an important issue, since there are forces in the US government both for and against bitcoin.  Any bad publicity can be seized by the opposition to tarnish bitcoin and discourage the public that is on the fence from trying it out.  And call for more regulations.  Time for the very early bitcoin adopters to stop ignoring the feelings of the novice public newly entering their ranks.  It is the established bitcoin community that should call for Bitinstant's accountability since they're the portal for a large majority of people making the transition.  If they can't handle the volume, raise the damn commissions to keep the quality high.

The gap only widens because inflation is built into the current monetary system. So, those with connections to power can grab much more of the percentage of newly printed cash while the vast majority stay stagnant, which in the current model, means falling behind, and thus the gap.  With bitcoin adoption, inflation rate becomes 0% (or negative), so that cuts out the shenanigans the already rich can play and that levels out the playing field a lot more than now.

It's in every state, city, Congressional county and controls the mainstream media.  Their influence is so pervasive and tentacled that they don't have to show up to issue an order, they just pull a lever on the system and everyone obeys.  Free market discipline doesn't apply to them, else they would've failed and disappeared a long time ago.  They own the political system of this country.

Can a certain percentage of miners adopt this new mining protocol and be ready to switch over all the miners in case government/market filters become the dominant force? This way we can keep the filter option open as a technology and close it if it becomes a threat. We would have to prepare a switch-over plan, but the cost would be an insurance policy against centralization.

Let's say bitcoin becomes universally used. There is a terrorist attack on a nuclear plant in any country by a lone attacker. He goes around using the Android bitcoin wallet ordering books from Amazon, renting cars, and paying dues to an extremist group. Whether it's a false flag or not, his bitcoin wallet will get blacklisted (since it reuses the same address) by the government and to uncover all the wallets that had connections to him, especially if the wallets belonged to the people who were his associates.

Well said, well said.  Personally, I came upon bitcoin as part of a spiritual journey where I saw the world was about to awaken to peace and abundance for everyone.  I knew that it was no accident and that bitcoins is a part of that transition.  I'm looking at a future world in which everyone in the world has enough to eat, shelter and to enjoy life.  With the economic revolution going on in bitcoins, the scientific revolution going on in physics as well as the imminent official disclosure of extraterrestrial contact with earth, I see that future as more likely everyday.  What is left to do is for people to come together as global citizens, make peace and take care of one another.  May the Mayan prophesy of a golden age of humanity be soon fulfilled.

The basic issue is whether known criminals should be prevented from using their bitcoins, and that the government and sanctioned organizations should maintain such a blacklist of criminals, not their names, just their bitcoins. 
It's like if it were possible to scan every dollar bill for their serial number and filter out all the dollars of drug dealers, pedophiles, terrorists, etc, then firms that do the filtering would get a fee and be sanctioned by government and other self-appointed organizations.

Me neither, but it may help to step back and look at the bigger picture.  Big multinational banks are actively working to stop bitcoin, yet Germany is starting a countertrend to foster bitcoin adoption, and China too.  Both countries are manufacturers and net exporters. Both want an alternative global currency to the dollar and that trend will continue to grow, especially as the dollar system becomes more volatile.  The Fed is currently facing a big test whether it can even signal a withdrawal from the US bond market without causing dislocations.  I don't think it can, which means as more people and countries get burnt, they too will be looking for an alternative system and the best candidate is bitcoin.

Their perspectus was 18 pages long and detailed every possible risk investors would face. That's not what con artists do.  They're flashing a big red light while saying do your due diligence and know that this is a high risk-high reward investment.  They did the right thing yet was widely ridiculed. If they were swindlers they'd promise the sky which they didn't.
As far as being "legitimized", yes they were naive in their understanding of how the military-industrial-banking complex works. They thought they could get the employees to order the owners around and they were wrong. Bitcoiners got a slap in the face instead.  I hope they have learned their lesson.  The US government has been draining liquidity out of the bitcoin market by regulating Mt Gox and others out of existence. So the twins are fighting back by opening a liquidity tap through 401Ks.  Whether they'll succeed or not, or maybe inspire ppl in other countries to petition their governments for the same investment rights, no one knows.  But they did raise bitcoin's profile - just an anecdoate - today my mom read about the twins in the paper and asked me a couple more questions about bitcoin.

Do you really think **economists** are going to save or break bitcoin? Economists are just front men for the status quo. They get paid to write theories about quantitative easing, why banks should get bailouts and why war is good for the economy. See Paul Krugman.  Economists are the excuse makers, the magistrates of the empire. Another money crisis is on the way. The revolution is coming, the empire will go, and so will economists, who should find a different profession because there's no need for the new society to have people centralize the power of money.
If the new money crisis empties out our FDIC insured bank accounts we will be locking up banksters and economists as co-conspirators to their crimes.

China is playing a smart geopolitical game. They're preparing for conflict over the East China Sea over Diaoyu Islands as well as the South China Sea over the Spratlys, mainly with the US as the instigator. Both sides know in this context another financial crisis is coming so both sides need to tighten up their national defenses in preparation. That means an economic evolution brought on by bitcoins is the least and the most of China's worries. They'd prefer to let the West take the lead on the bitcoin front and let the West's power games collapse first while preserving Chinese elites' hold on power until the last moment.

Since you agree that there's energy in the vacuum, then you must also agree the question of how much energy there is is hotly debated among physicists, a number ranging from very little in a cubic centimeter of space to one that is equivalent to the mass of the universe, practically infinite.
Have you personally tried and failed to build any one of the overunity energy devices whose videos are on Youtube?  I haven't but I would like to. 100 years ago, most scientists believed it was impossible to build a machine that could fly.

And the more we get the network effects in conversation, in daily use, among different classes of people, we will make it happen. You can tell how international it is already and it's only going to get bigger. Bitcoin is decentralized so we can shape it and make it work. I trust in the  natural wisdom of people. The consciousness of the whole knows where it's going. Even mistakes can be corrected and redeemed by all people.

Don't worry about what different groups say, including your own. That's what being born-again means, to have a personal relationship with Jesus. Don't be afraid of what is to come. The supernatural will be natural. Jesus is chill.

My impression is in the ideal properties of currency section, a lot of ppl would disagree w "irreversible payments" as an ideal property.  I would explain the rationale behind that and how additional consumer protection can be built on top of bitcoin to give people a peace of mind if there's demand for it.
Also, in terms of decentralization, I think you'll find that economists, especially the ones tenured in universities with government and corporate grants, hate the idea of bitcoin because they've based their academic lives on the power of central institutions to manage things.  But instead of doing an honest self-evaluation, they'll question you about the harmful effects of deflation, whether you can pay taxes with it, and that it's too volatile. In other words, they'll want to know if their work will still be useful for politicians and banks under such a system.  The answer is not really.  So, be prepared for their animosity. 
As recently as 3 months ago, they took a poll of the "leading" economic thinkers in the US and [87% of them]( said bitcoin will be limited in its usefulness.  Translation: they fucking hate bitcoin.  In fact, Obama's former economic advisor, Goolsbee, was quoted as saying "Hahahaha. ROTFL."  And these are professors from Harvard, Chicago, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and MIT.  Keep in mind that's likely where your professor's point of view is coming from.

The bailouts were financed with Treasury bonds with which the Fed swapped to the banks and got back "AAA rated" subprime derivative contracts.  They swapped quality risk-free bonds for pennies on the dollar junk at face value.  To the tune of trillions. Even before the financial crisis, the federal government was running a deficit.

A Chinese is likely to ask what a well researched opinion, what their professional credentials are. What gives them the authority, for eg scholars, experts and government officials who understand and have the power to make the best policies that will come true.
An American is likely to ask for the evidence presented in itself and to be evaluated on its conclusions for merit. A more democratic approach. Anyone can take at answering so more likely the best opinion will come forth.
Both cultures rely on both points of view. It's a matter of weighing more on which side. In this case I do agree more with the American's view but this will be the debate hopefully that the Chinese netizens have about their own destiny, politics, etc.
On the surface it was a siimple question, but the cultural clashes will come out and find a balance, and it should.

And he wants some organization called the Global Illicit Financial Team to be secretly "embedded in the Treasury" if it is "politically unpalatable".  The Global Illicit Financial Team was responsible for taking down Liberty Reserve and:


So the GIFT (o the irony) can kick people out of countries, has weapons, has access to the IRS with its power to freeze bank accounts, and it's INTERNATIONAL.

With the way FinCEN and bankers tried to bankrupt Gox by using a combination of withholding millions of their dollars while putting them in legal limbo to destroy their customers' faith in the exchange (still on legal hold in the US), there's no way Gox would have survived if Gox weren't on the up and up with all their accounts, both fiat and bitcoins. Gox is battle tested.  You gotta admit Gox's mettle.  Bitstamp works fine but hasn't been tested yet.
EDIT: Many of Gox's customers did withdraw their bitcoins, especially on the swoon down to $66, and if there was any word they couldn't, then Gox would have been finished. I don't think they have shorting arrangements bc they're still a huge target by the banking cartel and US authorities.

Nice shot of the Chinese bitcoin wallet app. I definitely think if Chinese bitcoiners plan to benefit only from the rising price of bitcoin, that they will miss out on a lot of opportunities that arise from the new ways of living and being at the forefront of change.  It's the new businesses and concepts that will generate the wealth.  I hope Chinese bitcoiners don't simply follow but lead the innovations because this is the chance of a lifetime.

I pay attention to each and every post about hacking, scams and security vulnerabilities. That's why I subscribe to r/bitcoin to make sure I know how to protect myself as I learn to benefit from this incredible new technology.
For eg, emergencies like Android's random number generator, this subreddit placed prominent "sticky" posts so the community would know to fix the problem. Or like when blockchain wallet had the same random generator problem, discussion immediately became a big deal and was resolved on the spot. 
The risk by the user to trust their coins to someone else before doing due diligence and against the overwhelming advice of this forum, that's a problem the user created.

Libertarianism has been the biggest force. Snowden is rooted in Libertarianism. Cody Wilson the maker of the 3D gun is heavily Libertarian. For the bitcoin community DPR is Libertarian. Even bitcoin the concept of private money to abolish central banks is Libertarian. The Tea Party is a Libertarian movement.  It didn't have to come to this, but some people are justifiably angry and standing up for themselves. If you strong arm them they will secede. Same as default.

The timing is wrong to go after criminals right now, with the power of nation states and central bankers to gateway us again. Besides, Mike Hearn has the full audience of all the smart people on bitcointalk, as well as on the Bitcoin Foundation. Why did he try to overrule the obvious supermajority there unless he had an idea to incorporate the current political structure to gain broader bitcoin acceptance? 
That was preceded by Mike Hearn to be an apologizer for Google's programmers who worked hand in glove with the NSA. His name is tainted in my book. People remember things, especially if its permanently recorded online.

ToTheMoonGuy is a meme for this subreddit that is a subconscious reflection of reality. With all the youtube videos about alleged ET bases on the moon, ufos, and structures of stonehenges and obelisks, it is likely that an emergent reality is about make of public Disclosure. The truth will rip off the mask of lies for building space weapons and answer the question of whether humans are alone in the universe, and whether they traveled across galaxies just to be pro-bono proctologists or gold miners.

If you include that previous bubble then the analysis doesn't work.  Then again, the technology was very unstable. Mt Gox got hacked into and all its bitcoins were sold at pennies.
Yes we've seen the post-bubble lows. When Cyprus happened, bitcoin was around $30.  Many things have changed since then. China has done their CCTV documentary to educate Chinese on bitcoin.  Germany has a bank now that supports bitcoin while the government says no capital gains tax on bitcoins held longer than a year.  And millions of Kenyans can now link their M-Pesa to bitcoin.  The step from being speculation to actual utilization alone should be enough for any self-respecting billionaire to keep a bid at $60, apparently even higher.

Here's how you'd do it in Ripple AFAIK.  You open an account at a Ripple gateway such as Bitstamp.net. Then you wire your USD there.  Withdraw your USD to your Ripple wallet (at a fee of 0.2%), where it becomes USD IOUs.  Inside Ripple, exchange your USD IOUs for Thai baht IOUs (you must already have a line of trust with the Thai gateway).  Then withdraw the baht IOUs to the Thai gateway (likely another fee).  From there you arrange to transfer the baht to your possession, most likely a transfer/wire to your Thai bank account.  Same process for HKD.

Go to the beginning of history and nobody has a clean state, even Adam and Eve had the original sin. By that definition you must come from no earthly parents
Freedom changes with the situation one is in and especially how they react to assert their freedom. Context in judgment is key.
EDIT: If America defaults and crushes not only Americans bank accounts but the generational savings of other countries, then freedom of speech will be the last thing the world thinks of the US. Just a bum. Plenty of the abused with grudges to settle.

Can we have a backup plan like Eligius mining pool wants to do in case filters become necessary due to government false flags? This way Eligius's plan doesn't have to apply to all of bitcoin right away. Use it as a possible counter and see what happens to the development of market driven filters without making them impossible. I don't know exactly how mining works but I heard that mining protocols can be tried out on a temporary basis.
I'm saying don't let market driven filters become the dominant force but don't make them impossible either.

Let's say bitcoin becomes universally used.  There is a terrorist attack on an American nuclear plant by a lone attacker. He goes around using the Android bitcoin wallet ordering books from Amazon, renting cars, and paying dues to an anti-government organization. Whether it's a false flag or not, his bitcoin wallet will get blacklisted (since it reuses the same address) as well as the CIA, FBI and DHS uncovering all the wallets that had connections to him, especially if the wallets belonged to the people who were his comrades in calling for violence.
There goes a good reason for starting.. needing a blacklist as an emergency to protect people. There would be no thought into whether it's flawed idea, it will get done. Knowing how the military-industrial-banking cabal operates, you can bet a false flag operation will be staged. Can't avoid the issue.

I really applaud you doing the hard work of advocacy.  Corporate criminals is exactly what they are.

Reminds me of when I once attended a public hearing on the extension of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in NY and how smug the committee members were and how powerless an individual like me can feel in the machine of bureacracy. Yet public advocacy can bring pressure to at least shine a light in places that are used to operating ruthlessly against the public interest while smiling at us.  If nothing else, their political operatives become more careful to not draw more public scrutiny to the issue.  They'd have to conduct studies to cover their asses, which buys some time.

You don't need to "wire" bitcoins and banks currently do not offer that option. But you don't need banks, you can send bitcoins yourself from your bitcoin wallet to their wallet for ~1 penny per transaction.  If you're in the US, coinbase, localbitcoins, and bitcoin-brokers are good ways to go, and bitinstant when it's working.  For your partner to buy or sell in Africa, that depends on the country they're in. Check out howtobuybitcoins.info but that site may need to be updated as things happen fast in the bitcoin world.
If your partner happens to be in Kenya, there's a new wallet service called Kipochi.com which easily converts between bitcoin and M-Pesa.  They want to promote bitcoin as an inter-country exchange currency to link up many African countries, so check with them for the latest information.

I went to the historical charts and  looked at the last 2 "bubbles" in bitcoins (not including Apr) and I noticed each time it took about 5 months to work off the excess before breaking out to new highs.  I also noticed there was an expansion in the ratio of the pre bubble price to the peak price, like it's accelerating.  The one in Apr increased by almost 9x.  I know it's only 3 samples, but just going on gut, the next price expansion should be much higher than 9x.  I read somewhere that it takes 10% of the population to hold an unwavering belief in something for the other 90% to eventually come around.  10% is the critical mass number.

dawangzi, 欢迎你来这个reddit群发表你的意见。这群里许多人都想了解中国人怎么看待比特币还有比特币在中国的发展。很多人已经投了很多钱在比特币上，所以都积极地希望看到比特币更快的进展和成功。这群的一般人都反对美国政府对比特币的限制，反对美联储印钞票贬值美金和反对国际银行行业对老百姓的剥削和剥夺的民主权。大家不知到美国政府的下一招是什么， 但是都在仔细地观察和把下一棋的玩法准备好。更重要的是比特币的分权力使它能经受住一点性的打击，尽管打击的是一个世界强国。只要有其他国家和世界人民支持比特币，增加各国人民的交流，信任和合作，比特币一定成功。美国的比特币爱好者会尽力的贡献。
dawangzi, welcome to this subreddit to express your opinion.  Many people here are curious what the Chinese think about bitcoins and how it's developing there.  Many redditors here have invested heavily into bitcoin so we want to see a faster speed of adoption and success.  Most are opposed to the restrictions the American government has put on bitcoin, opposed to the Federal Reserve printing and devaluing the dollar, and opposed to the exploitation by the international banking industry on people and hijacking people's democratic rights.  No one knows what the next move the American government will make, but we're watching closely and planning for contingencies.  More importantly, it's the strength of bitcoin in its decentralized nature that it can withstand a single point of attack, even if it comes from a world superpower.  As long as there are other countries and the world supporting bitcoin, and increased interaction, trust and cooperation among people, it will succeed.  American bitcoiners will do the utmost to contribute.

If you plan to manage your own wallet, make sure you back it up regularly and know how to keep your computer virus free. Encrypt both your computer and your phone in case they get lost. Use the Authy app to manage Google Authenticator 2fa because Authy backs up to their servers and it's easy for you to reset it.  If you're up to it, run your web browser in a VirtualBox program separate from your wallet.  And speaking of browsing, I'd install No Script and Ghostery in FF.
Once you get comfortable with the idea of bitcoins as a currency, don't let it simply sit there - learn about the investment options such as buying bitcoin equity (r/bitcoinstocks) and lending to bitcoin entrepreneurs (check out this excellent article on [Coinlenders at btcwarrior.net.](  Best of luck!

Is it because you're concerned about a possible 51% attack due to mining centralization? Because I think the system is democratic enough and publicized enough that it will be carefully monitored for this risk.  Both mining firms and the large base of bitcoin users have incentives to make sure that doesn't happen.  The miners check for the integrity of the bitcoin ledger, whereas there are users who check for the integrity of the miners.  They will be the canary in the coal mine and like in a democracy the ultimate responsibility for checks and balances lies with the public.
If what you're saying is you wished everyone can mine and make money from it, then that runs against economic specialization that happens in business. For eg, there can only be so many internet search engines.  But just like how the search engines changed the rules and opened up new ways of doing business, so can bitcoins. Keep a close eye on how bitcoin changes people's habits and be on top of those waves.

I once had a problem when trying out blockchain's wallet app, when I didn't yet understand sometimes a mining fee has to be included with a payment.  So I tried to back out of the box asking to include the mining fee.  Instead, the app took that as sending the bitcoins with no fee, which landed 3+ bitcoins in limbo land, out of my wallet but not in the destination address.  Blockchain didn't even bother to reply to my support ticket. I had to find out from this forum that it was standard practice for blockchain to ignore that kind of mistake made by their customers.  After more research I found out that after a certain number of days, the bitcoins would be returned to the sending account, which was what happened.  I deleted Blochain's wallet app after that.  And I keep nothing in the online wallet.

The problem with Bitinstant is they're tone deaf to people's frustrations.  Their management is young and inexperienced at dealing with people.  It makes sense that since bitcoin was invented by nerds (which I'm grateful for) that nerds often score low on the EQ and by extension, customer service.  However, they are definitely not a scam.  It would be very helpful to hear their management speak up publicly why this is happening and what they're doing about it.  Then actually do it.

I didn't use those words "conspiracy theory" if you read what I actually said. Not all conspiracy theories are correct. 
In this case it's right, these cartels from weapons, oil, and banking businesses that form a special lobby has so much power that it takes over the American government.  It's why the bankers got all the bailouts and no jail. Why America always fights a war somewhere, and why they fight where there's oil.  People like Dick Cheney and Halliburtan owned both oil and and defense contractors. The intelligence service doesn't like people to find out so they create Prism and Panopticon, an idea based on a round building where everyone can be observed everywhere except the unseen watchman in the center. 
It's these early dangers that President Eisenhower highlighted in his Farewell Address but were ignored. It's time to fix the conspiracy's mistakes and twisted tragedies.  Stop confusing the American people for not knowing why Iranians are mad at them because the CIA killed a lot of Iranians.  Stop creating mistrust between nations. President Jimmy Carter lost his presidency due to the Iranian hostage crisis.  Where is America sovereignty?  Where is the blame and the ones responsible?  Where are the American traitors?  Not to extract vengeance, but for justice and responsibility.

Bitcoin is an inflation proof currency that is consistent with the historical trend of the rising purchasing power of a person's assets as measured by their lifetime labor.  All technological advances had the effect of freeing people up from hard manual labor and of reaching higher efficiencies of production to have their needs met.  The one remaining barrier is the public ledger of what each person has produced, what stores their value, which is fiat money.  Because the elite had always controlled this public ledger, they could always reset it or manipulate it, or create the conditions for war and chaos which perpetuate the pyramid power structure that puts them at the top.  Bitcoin takes away this last barrier and puts the public ledger where it belongs, with the public. That's why it is an international currency, a global movement to rewrite the financial and political rules to benefit everyone. In this happy case, public and self interests coincide. We're going to flatten that pyramid.
If you do invest, keep in mind once you can get comfortable with the idea that it's a currency, to check out bitcoin stocks.  They are the bull market within the bull market, with top companies' P/Es in the low single digits.  Also, there are websites where you can lend bitcoins to a diversified business portfolio at 25%+ APR.  This way, even if bitcoins go down after you buy them, if you invest wisely you can be hedged against the volatility.

Very true on the potential for US to fall behind China.  And I see the irony of most of the innovations coming out of the US yet it's trending to be the most restrictive environment for bitcoin. The the top mining firm in the world is a Chinese firm called ASICMiner.  It seems to have the most integrated bitcoin business structure, from selling all its products in bitcoins to getting its financing thru bitcoin denominated equity.  I wouldn't be surprised if it already has a supplier network all transacting in bitcoins, thus increasing the critical mass for those other businesses to expand bitcoin's reach inside China.  More good people in the US government need to help us behind the scenes to make sure we don't lose our competitive edge.  If the dollar is going to fall, let it fall but let's aggressively seize the new opportunity in bitcoin.

This isn't like a brokerage holding your stocks. You can choose to hold your own "stocks" on your own computer. With bitcoins no trust involved on that side.

Also keep in mind the market cap for bitcoins is a mere $1 billion.  I read somewhere the total amount of cash in the world is around $5 trillion.  If bitcoins takes over only 1% of that representation of money, it would still be $50 billion, 50 times what's it's worth now.  And 1% is a way way low estimate of its potential.

There's a possibility the government is playing it very smart - let the economic revolution lead the way in the West and topple the Western power structure that is in decline so that China can protect its power until the last moment.

I liked what you said before that it would take a global catastrophe to come together, to acknowledge how close to the edge we were, even if some people fall off because they were meant to fall into the abyss in the story. Those who can't tell the truth. Those that don't take responsibility. The ones to whom what's been revealed do not act even in their own self interests. The ones who stubbornly stick to the small stories that they're just insignificant bodies who have no other dimensions to their consciousness. The ones who don't grow and evolve.  This is the story of evolution of human consciousness.
According to Edgar Cayce the American prophet, we at least averted WWIII and the flashpoints of Egypt, Turkey, Libya and Syria. So our odds are getting better to move onto the golden age prophecy, which in perfect timing happens with the era of bitcoins.

I'm sorry but it's naive to think they don't understand what the real target is.  It's any threat to the military-industrial-banking cabal.  Bitcoin challenges the dollar reserve status that lets the US buy imports cheaply and have control over the global oil business which in turn controls the economies of the world.  Look at what happened to Saddam Hussein when he tried to challenge the dollar.  Dollars grease the war machine that generates mega profits for the owners of this country. It's about control and dollars are the linchpin on so many different levels in this period of change.

That's the biggest prize is using bitcoins as currency. Take that away and I wouldn't be surprised if btcchina goes back to below bitstamp in price. This is what happens when a well meaning government regulation doesn't work on a fast moving technology. But the Chinese will know something is wrong when their bitcoin price drops from a global 1st to 3rd. Then they'll have to adjust. 
On the other hand, they're playing a geopolitical game of economic revolution and maybe they're playing the middle of the pack to let other countries take the risks then come in with the right balance of different factors. Could be the smart thing to do in the end. What a game.

Don't look at what people say, look at what they **do**. The US has 1 bitcoin trading company, Coinbase. China has 15 bitcoin exchanges.

Let's say bitcoin becomes universally used.  There is a terrorist attack on an American nuclear plant by a lone attacker. He goes around using the Android bitcoin wallet ordering books from Amazon, renting cars, and paying dues to an anti-government organization. Whether it's a false flag or not, his bitcoin wallet will get blacklisted (since it reuses the same address) as well as the CIA, FBI and DHS uncovering all the wallets that had connections to him, especially if the wallets belonged to the people who were his comrades in calling for violence.
There goes a good reason for starting.. needing a blacklist as an emergency to protect people. Knowing how the military-industrial-banking cabal operates, you can bet a false flag operation will be staged. Can't avoid the issue.

Maybe we can have a partial tryout like [Eligius mining pool]( wants to do in case filters become necessary due to government false flags. This way Eligius's plan doesn't have to apply to all of bitcoin right away. Use it as a possible counter and see what happens to the development of market driven filters without making them impossible. I don't know exactly how mining works but I heard that mining protocols can be tried out on a temporary basis.
I'm saying don't let market driven filters become the dominant force but don't make them impossible right away. Adopt a wait and see attitude but have a backup ready to switch on.

ps - Nassim Haramein shows how infinity can exist within discrete space by circumscribing 2 overlapping triangles within a circle, then circumscribing each of the 6 points with smaller circles, then circumscribing each of the 36 points with smaller circles, and so on for an infinite number of iterations, producing a fractal that never exceeds the discrete unit of the initial circle.  Thus a "God" particle will never be found because matter is infinitely divisible.

Bitcoin banks can be created and there's already one in Cyprus called NeoBee, but we're going to have new rules on banking. For eg, as a bitcoin acct holder I insist to have access to my private key anytime I want to withdraw the entire acct. Banks that don't conform to the new economics would not get my bitcoins. Fractional banking is possible with bitcoin, but more like 50% capital reserve for loans, instead of 10% or whatever low amount it is right now. This way there'll be a real cushion. Consumers and nations will feel out what the right ratio is. And let badly managed banks go bankrupt.  But loans can still take place.
The government can still fund a war even if they used bitcoins, if the citizens supported the war, loaned them money, or allied nations lent them money. But war is a costly enterprise, and people usually tire quickly of fighting, without the war racket known as the military-industrial-banking complex that also controls the reins of political power. Violence is a costly enterprise. Most people prefer to compromise than come to blows, just like regular people. I predict with bitcoins, wars will likely happen much less or at all.

Totally agree.  A buy bitcoin thru SMS system would let the average non-technophile person use bitcoin without needing to know anything about the blockchain or how to make a Windows computer secure, which is a near impossibility for even experts.  I know Coinapult already does something similar, but it would be better if the system didn't require an internet anchor to function, since many ppl in the US and around the world don't have internet.  The M-PESA in Africa is a great model for how simplicity encourages widespread use.  This way, they can check their balance at anytime like a savings account, which would only be a couple of buttons away on a device ppl already carry around like a wallet, instead of having to boot up a computer.

No, while I don't like the spread, it will go on. The first time a US government cannot break a brokerage house with that much money seized. Difference is brokerage houses are built on trust, but Mt Gox customers' can call back their bitcoin at any time, no trust needed.  US by accident helped Mt Gox keep only the most bullish bitcoin customers, ones that believe the world will not end up with USD, but only bitcoins. All USD believing customers left Mt Gox, so of course the most bullish market will emerge on Mt Gox.  
Plus the dad and mom investors are trying to arbitrage by selling to Mt Gox, adding to liquidity trap made by the banks and US government by squeezing Mt Gox wires. Like adding fuel to the fire on Mt Gox.

If there's a change in blockchain's policy, I wish blockchain would explain things to him and make peace. Put him on some part time project or something. He does seem sincere in his efforts to improve blockchain. Maybe the problem is blockchain saying the code is not open source anymore and you changed your mind.

I think there's an overall effort both openly and covertly to squeeze liquidity out of bitcoin. Like how Bitinstant doesn't work in some parts of the US now. Australians seem to have a harder time buying bitcoins too.  Rules were written by the established banking interests and will increasingly be used to disrupt the flow of capital into bitcoin.  They will fail though, as bitcoin becomes more international and outside the control of US allied authorities. In the meanwhile, the military-industrial-banking complex will not go down without a fight.

Hi lovebitcoin, yes there must be temptation for Chinese elites to hold on to their power structure too, so people high up issue orders.
But I'm more curious, what do the Chinese bitcoiners envision how the bitcoin revolution will unfold with decentralized political power in Chinese society? If the banks collapse, that affects the government and all its top down command structures. Is there a vision for China to go from a tradition of central power to civic groups that can self-organize? If bitcoin goes as intended, political change may happen very quickly in the US as well as China.

Actually, it means you can easily move currency IOU's around the world.  To get your hands on the currency, the IOU's must first be converted into the currency at a gateway.  Then you must have some arrangement with the gateway to receive it, and the most likely way is to thru a bank account already denominated in that currency.  It is not as simple as their marketing points suggest.  I only know this because I tried using Ripple, spent time and money until I realized it's more meant for businesses, not the average user.

lol. Well that depends on the size of your bitcoin wallet.  A girl can escalate things very quickly if she knows what she wants, then pull back and put the ball in your court. Seriously though, have you considered keeping some microtransactions in a blockchain wallet then when you hit send, leave out the fee.  This way the bitcoin leaves your wallet, no miners pick it up, and it goes to limbo land for a few days of vacation.  After that it gets deleted and credited back to your account.  You tell the robber oops, I forgot to include a transaction fee and if he's up on his bitcoin stuff, he'll know it's useless to contact blockchain's customer support, at which point you push the lock screen button and give him the phone and pray that you get to a computer to reset your things before he can pull off a cold-boot attack.

They were set up by IPO investors who bought at least 5000 shrs. The 3 that I know that set them up are burnside, who runs btct.co, ThickAsThieves, and DeaDTerra.  There are 2 basic types of pass-thrus.  A 1 for 1 type where you'd get all the dividends a direct share gets but thru the IPO investor as a credit to your trading account, and a 1 for 100 type where you get 100th of a direct share to your trading acct.  PTs do not have voting rights with friedcat bc technically you are not on his investor's list.  PT's can also be recalled at anytime by the issuing investor (atleast on btct.co) but that is unlikely bc they're a major source of trading revenue.  Lastly, there's a management fee on the dividends paid on the PT's, for btct.co it's 3% for the regular shrs under 1000 shrs with lower fees for higher volume.  I haven't tried bitfunder.com for trading but I imagine it works the same way.

Also that it'll eventually be open-sourced.  That should do it, but I can't guarantee he won't shoot you out of annoyance.

Look to the right hand side of this page where it says "How to buy bitcoins" and click on that.

It's interesting both bitcoins and Linux were the achievements of a small group of dedicated idealists and both are superior to costlier mainstream alternatives.  Maybe it's time more people gave Ubuntu or some other version of Linux a try and install it as a second boot option next to Windows.  Then they can do their regular work in Windows while they use Ubuntu only for the bitcoin wallet. Over time, they can migrate more functions to Ubuntu as they learn more abt it.

This is an oversimplification of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and how the Nationalists then the Communists came into power.  There was a lot of bloodshed and tremendous loss of life interwoven with 2 World Wars.  However, it is a pretty good description of the evolution of the Capitalist Party in America with Republicrats and Democraticans pretending to be on different sides on insignificant issues but both agreeing to unending bailouts of banks at the expense of the people.


Something must be holding them together to have the 2nd largest economy in the world.. for now.  I don't want to get into a debate abt which country is better cuz I think both countries are great.  It just alarms me when people in America can't recognize when someone else is doing something right and have the humility to learn from them.  Because when you can't see something, it means you no longer have it in yourself.  Then you will be blindsided by the up and comer and fall behind.  Just an honest appreciation of a person or a country would take care of that.

Bitcoin will be a global currency, with new rules of business and new political systems. Such as the bitcoin community on this subreddit - it's international.  I propose we de-emphasize national boundaries, and emphasize common global values. Wherever we find those values, such as privacy and freedom of expression, we should promote them. Russia has been standing up for internet privacy as a global citizen. Therefore I applaud what they've done and give them credit, especially President Putin. It doesn't make them a permanent saint. We judge by the results.

No problem! Yea many people have been in your shoes and computer security is the biggest challenge in having bitcoins. That and making sure to backup your wallet file regularly. Once you get over that hump I'm sure you'll make all your money back and more. Plus in the future, bitcoin banks will make using it much more consumer-friendly, but then the price will be much higher too. It's worth getting into it early. Good luck!

No, it means you can send currency IOU's to anyone.  To actually turn that IOU into currency requires a conversion at a gateway.  Then from the gateway, you need to already have a bank account denominated in that currency to receive it.

I get that sarcasm is important to help people see that the king is naked. But the next thing to do is yell don't stand there put your freakin pants on!
More people are coming to it's time for the bitcoin community to take our proper place.

Start with the shape of the Star of David, which is 2 opposite facing and overlapping triangles.  Circumscribe with a circle.  At each of the 6 points of contact make a smaller Star of David and circumscribe with a circle.  That's 6 smaller replicas of the initial picture.  Then within each of 6 repeat the process to end up with 36 smaller replicas.  Reiterate like a fractal onto infinity. Then you'll have infinity existing within discrete space. Make the circle a sphere and it'll be 3D.

This is what bitcoin needs, a simple way for ppl to get their hands on bitcoins and send them without having to know anything about the blockchain or how to make Windows completely secure.

I wouldn't go preach there. Learn the language. Make some local friends in their language. Get out of the expat circle. 
Live how they live then see what they see in bitcoin. You may even spot the next original idea.

A **lot** of people including my family and friends and people I depend on.  But just in case I took the cash out of my bank account.  After 2008 the crooks didn't go to jail and kept on looting.  The people who caused the problems were the same ones that came up with the solution. The hole must be bigger.

No that was just someone's idea. People have lots of ideas on bitcointalk.org.  And lots of people wanting to be middlemen on bitcoin so they can charge a fee on what is free. Does not mean someone is actually paying a premium for some coins over others.
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:05:51
Yes people will pay a premium just to get in.  What country are you in and is Bitonic a fully SMS based system?
Edit: meaning a working, standalone SMS system..

What are you, blind? The US government doesn't see itself as having to "cooperate" with anybody.  Here's a recent article from Zerohedge showing how the USG tried to strong arm and bully the Swiss government into revoking its bank privacy laws, which was defied by the Swiss.  USG responded with threats to [cut the Swiss National Bank out of the global dollar payment system.](

Whatever way is best to simpifly things for noobs, like the basic idea of non-reversibility. Bitcoin does not work like credit cards. Companies can be built with the functions of credit cards, reversibility, fractional banking, etc, based on bitcoins, but that's for later.  So take financial responsibility and respect the risks of bitcoins, as it does give people new powers.

In a zero interest rate environment where the backer government of those T-bills is heavily indebted with a debt load at over 90% of GDP AND fighting an unending global war on terror?  I wouldn't advise my mom to lend money to someone who's living on rolling over their credit card balances.

I like it, but they can answer the question themselves by voting with their money. Bitcoins sells itself, especially in high inflation countries like Argentina.
