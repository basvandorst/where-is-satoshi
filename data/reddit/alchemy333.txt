This is what I was thinking as well. Why would anyone continue to give money to a service that lost money and dont know how they lost it? But they are open to lose more money, inexplicably?  Maybe its an intelligent test from the Universe. :-)

I think they should just say Bitcoin instead of e-coin. That is just kinda silly. Also, the show is not as interesting as it was last season. Kinda weird and all over the place. A new watcher who did not see the last season is probably wondering what all the hype is about. :-)

Since there is no shortage of people willing to do the proof of work miners do. I say we reduce the miners payout to half of what it is and then give the other half to a random transaction address.
this seems easily enough to rewrite.

So can't we just make it so that in order to "imitate" that you are a node, you have to do something constructive? Even if that is donating   
maybe 1 satoshi every so often? 
I mean there has got to be a way to do this right? 
And Ill bet the real Saoshi Nakamoto is hard at work on this. Bless his soul.

Does this not mean that the Miners have a "centralized" ability to control Bitcoin? Even if I decide NOT to upgrade. They can create the last 50 blocks, which triggers my node to warn me that its time to upgrade, and if I do not I will find myself not on "Bitcoin" anymore.
It seems to me this is one of the 2 flaws in Bitcoin:
1. the miners, a few people, can decide what the majority do, since the mining of coins is currently allowed to be controlled by a few, and the rest have to follow because we CANT afford to mine. Its kind of like a reflection of our current broken democracy. :-) when you think about it.
2. I just had to delete my node because i was running out of disk space as my data file was over 85 GB, and that is just too much for me and my flash drive. SO I had to give it up. More of the average people will do this and the "corporations" will be the only ones with nodes over time.
It seems like we need another Nakamoto Satoshi to come along and fix these 2 issues that need to be addressed and and create a new Bitcoin where EVERYONE can mine, and can do it with a regular PC
This can be done simply by issuing a LOTTERY out of all those that simply provide a NODE, and not to miners.
We needed miners originally because we were not certain that people would participate, now that we know there will be participation, we can change the mining methodology.   
Im gonna create  a new post of this. :-)

The code as is produces the following example:
* 258aba177a70761a0f024bc29e7a84774aa43a4e7e9afa4e51197acaf7599461
* 16980684650313913290055524188321658520828042816455058210812776576801679447137
* 77
1st is a 64 hexadecimal string
2nd this string converts to a random 77 digit base 10 number.
That's really all we need to create a key more or less right?

Some fear what they do not understand. Remember, Yeshua(Jesus) cured the sick, rose the dead, magically transformed food and walked on water...he was beyond the understanding of most of humanity back then and ergo triggered the fear in them that they too may be that powerful. So they removed what they feared. Humans tend to move towards what feels comfortable and away from what makes them uncomfortable. Blessings.

Im not saying give the mining fee to everybody. Still just to 1 person, Im just saying "hey we have a large amount of the community that wants to help right? so lets identify the helpers on this block and RANDOMLY select one to get the bounty." Thats what im saying. 
Work gets done and the bounty is now DECENTRALIZED. 
With the current mining system. We have centralized the mining which created the potential of a mining monopoly , and we have created a mining class, if you will. 
Do we really need these 2 negatives if the idea was simply to ensure that the work gets done? I think not. There is plenty of people who want to do the work of making the block and we have the network community power, why create classes and centralization. Lets just do some create reprogramming.
Just 1. identify the pool wanting to do work on the next block. Give them all an identity, lock them in. The work gets done by all in THAT block pool. 2. That pool solves the block and do the work. 3. Someone from the pool is RANDOMLY given the bitcoin. 
This encourages people to run a CORE server the right way and when they get home they have a nice surprise if they hit the lottery.
And we can do away with all these mining colonies. They are not needed anymore. We have the power of community combined computing power. Just needs creative reprogramming.

why do we care what the old centralized system thinks or does? W have been provided a fully decentralized system. They have no power over it, so why give a shit? Just use Bitcoin and ignore them. What, you fear they are gonna make it illegal? You mean like Bitorrent and thepiratebay? Lol :-) They will have as much power over bitcoin as they do over thepiratebay.se and bittorrent or the IRC. Decentralized is untouchable, so we can ignore them. They have no power. We ARE our government and we can do ANYTHING we choose. Egypt got rid og a 40 year dictator in 2 weeks by simply demanding it.

You are so busy not accepting what is (which is the cause of all suffering)  that you are not noticing the positive. 
How about the fact that Bitcoins used to be at $1200. and now you can buy at low $300? 
Added to that the fact that the dollar is about to crash and the entire planet is about to get on board shooting the price to like $10,000 for a bitcoin.
Some would say now is an awesome time to buy when you can. That the price dropping, is an awesome thing. $every $50 worth of bitcoin you buy now , is you becoming that much richer, very soon.

If you notice, this world has a lot of Polarity. This or that. Male female, up down, in out, Republican, democrat, good bad, positive negative. We live in a world of polarity.
That being said, all things are neutral. The only meaning something has is the meaning we assign to it. Nothing has any actual meaning. 
For Bitcoin, this polarity shows in positive or negative outlook on Bitcoin. We assign meaning according to our belief about it. So people tend to apply a positive label or a negative label. You can see the positive polarity is we will be rich! this is the best thing to replace the dollar etc. And the negative polarity available is. "this is the end" "dont be a fool, this is a waste of money" etc. 
So, take a look at how we live in a reality of Duality and polarity. Even our technology comes don't to a binary system of just 0's and 1's.

Bitcoin is stagnant right now because 99% of the world is not ready for it yet and still use the dollar. So BTC enthusiasts are twiddling their thumbs. THIS gives us something to do as we engage the 99% and provide a service to them and allow them to become UNBANKED. Disconnecting them from the TIT of fiat. The dollar will eventually fail and this system of being unbanked will not be so alien to them. They can more easily transition to Bitcoin.

Actually , no, the people can vote which system they want to continue in by using that version. Who would choose to remain on a system where the miners can hijack everything? I would not. And on top of that, why would I not choose the fork that allows ME to earn bitcoins? Many will go where the users go and the miners system will inevitable die. This is how Andreas lays it out also, the miners do not have ultimate power. WE do. The masses. And if a much better fees and reward POS comes about, the day to day users can and will override the miners.

no, it is not "too late." Miners do not have a monopoly. We can always change the code and the algorithm and do a hard fork and if we the people, the masses go with the NEW fork, the old fork is DEAD.  forking and following the fork was always a counterbalance to someone or something hijacking bitcoin. Remember, if the majority go with the fork, the old version dies. :-)
And the majority is not based on mining power, its based on number of active nodes. So your non mining node counts.

Because of the FAITH that people have over it.
The values of a currency is the faith/value people place on it. People have a lot of value to bitcoin OVER any other. 
this is why it will hit $10k soon...........it is valued at $1K is just a fraction of the earth population (7 billion) even AWARE of what it bitcoin is capable of adding to their lives. The freedom. The 10K value is based on when the population becomes aware. :-) And they are steadily and constantly being made aware. The beast of China is awakening. The beast of India, populations wise, are awakening. I say 10K is minimum. :-) People will buy homes with bits in the years to come.

Fees started out amazing, like 2 cents a transaction, but they are not scaling well , or the system allows the miners to pick and choose and this is a mistake. 
Sitoshi did not solve ALL the problems of this digital money system. It is up to us to see what needs adjusting and adjust it.
I would personally like EVERYONE to be able to mine bitcoin and not just those with money and resources. That is the old system. 
If I could easily mine, I would definitely go after the low fees market and make a killing doing that, but I do not have this choice. 
Bitcoin needs a tad more decentralization. IMHO.

this is why I say the mining/proof of work problem needs to be re-written so that anyone with a node can do it. Like a lottery system where ALL active nodes are in the drawing and have a chance to win.

They can see all the money in all addresses only. Unless you let people know its your address, no one really knows.

Rosie, I updated my post with the aweful result of your support response. You guys should be ashamed. Carter totally ignored my 2 request, to cancel the order and talk to my bank and explain that it was Coinbase fault. You took no responsibility. You ignored the bug in your software that acts like the order is cancelled when in fact it goes through, leaving me clueless. You caused your customer great harm and did nothing. ??? Im so done with you guys.

why would bitcoin community support any government sale when its selling bitcoins that were stolen by said government from their owners?
Just because they violated the governments rules, does not mean they violated bitcoin rules. There are no rules in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:05:04
and VEEP! :-)
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:27:50
Bitcoin has no limits or rules. The only limits are the ones we CHOOSE to allow or follow. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 19:52:26
is there a link that verifies or shows where the bitcoins actually came from? 
If we just believe what is "written" then we can easily be deceived. CNN writes a whole lot of crap that is not true.
It is my understanding that the source of these coins are not being released and there is just conjecture and hearsay. For all we know these coins could be hacked from legitimate owners or from holders who the state have deemed violated their Bitcoin prohibitions. If they are not saying, then there is no way for us to truly know is there? 
I say make them reveal where they are from or we do not buy from them. This is what a wise Bitcoin community would do...when you use the definition that wisdom is when your choices bring you joy. 
I find it disingenuous, to say the least, when A government does not support or allow its citizens to sell bitcoins, but they are able to sell it and not reveal where they got it. The idea of Bitcoin is that no one just gets money for doing nothing, one has to earn it. If we earn it and the government steals it, and we buy it back from them, then they get rich for doing noting and are once again creating money out of thin air. This is against everything Satoshi stood for and wanted to avoid. 
All we know is that under official title, someone got some bitcoins and is now getting cash for them.  We know not where it came from and where the money will go. Its all hush hush and "need to know only" That's CIA, thats NSA, that is giving ones power away. We need less secrets not more. Stop trusting closed government, this is how one is bamboozled. Voluntarily.

Insulting me, although it may make you feel better about your positi9n, does not mean you have any more evidence than I do. Just means you are more immature and likely less intelligent, because there is much evidence to prove that intelligent people are polite.

I actually just solved the issue.

@_date: 2017-08-19 15:03:40
Because of the preponderance of evidence. It all comes down to going to court, and someone judging the evidence. The block chain provides proof of existence, without a doubt and the evidence is unmutable. Even the government copy right office is capable of fraud and corruption. The blockchain is a dumb network with no 3rd parties. Anyone with lesser proof than the block chain has lost the case. I also offer that blockchain evidence in a court case has NEVER lost a copyright case. In the end everyone gets to choose what they feel is right for them, there is no right or wrong answer here. :-)

This would be great for Freelancers who want to make it easy for their clients to pay in BTC and use their familiar debit cards. It falls short obviously because of:
limits to $5. Freelancers would need their clients to buy a minimum of $300
Makes clients have to subscribe. Would be best if we keep it easy for them, they are already doing this at our request so the less hoops the better. Register the buys as the Freelancers account and leave the clients out of this. IMHO.
For most freelancers this is cute, but does no good.

I disagree with the claims of that article, which says to just pay the government and kisten to harvard law etc. That is the old way. The new way is that once yiu create something it is automatically copyrighted by you. And what it comes down to is proving that your property existed befire anyone else and this evidence will hold up in court. Which the blockchain hash will. We dont need 3rd party authorities any more. And bligs are niw paid money to do ad pieces' which thus smells like to me. The copyright office is just like banks. They will loose billions of dollars because of the blockchain. Blessings

this is a myth that is passed around and sounds good, but in actual court cases this does not hold up and the side that does this , always looses their case.

This is why it is even more important that Bitcoin be changed to allow users to be able to easily mine the coins. This way new users  can put in the work and get their coins, instead of having to prostrate themselves to companies that are out of integrity. 
There are plenty of people, millions, who will ensure that transactions are valid via the mining procedures, we just have to adjust the way its done and lower the hash rate. It can be as simple as having everyone do proof of work, and then whoever did it in 10 minutes is in the lottery and the dumb network does an algorithm and randomly selects like 20 people and divides up the bounty and sends to them. 
This would solve a ton of issues. It will decentralize mining. Which is how it should be. Also this way the coinbases of the world becomes powerless as there are now millions of people mining and receiving bitcoins daily and they can sell to whoever they want, whenever they want. No system or government will be able to stop such numbers.

It is going to be waaaay more that current ATM fees once 1 billion people get on board, which is in a year or 2. India is waking up to it, and China. They have a few people. :-) The point is the fee is increasing exponentially with the price. This is because miners are allowed to pick and choose, so companies and wallets have to increase their fees if they want to provide fast and "normal" service.  This is not scalable and not wise and we may want to look at this now. Is there a team that is working on this. I would consider joining them on this effort. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:22:38
Normal transactions used to be .02 cents. It's now 6 times that and sometimes 10 times that. This is a serious enough issue since only a fraction of 1 % of the population uses bitcoin. If this fee continues to scare in multiples of 6, when we have a billion people using bitcoin daily, what do you think the fees will be? Pretty much what atm fees are now. We need to remove miners who get to act like bankers and allow everyone with a phone to be able to mine and protect the system and get the bitcoins. Thus was one of the  major flaws in Satoshi's creation. Sooner or later we have to address the mining issue and change it. We can dobit, we have the brain power. :-)

And so we see an intelligent test for humanity by the Universe. The Universe gives us a new mature financial system that allows us to take back the power we have been giving away to others. 
And here we see some companies, (not people) but corporations, buckling and lining up to give their power BACK to the the banks and the regulators who are out of integrity. "Please license and control me! Please take my power away!" All out of fear. It would seem corporations are failing the Universe's intelligent tests. :-)
We don't have to be scared of them anymore remember, they are powerless to do anything. WE control our money now. No middle man. It seems like it is only the middle men that are folding. The Circles, the Coinbases, the Bitstamps. Let them fold. But you hols fast. There is nothing anyone regulators can do to Bitcoin, therefore your money which you now control. They are just like the MPAA....powerless. They will be fight for a while like the MPAA, but ask yourself, is torrenting still a thing? Are people empowered to share files? Yes. Can the MPAA do anything about it? No, not really. 
Same with ALL Bitcoin regulation. The only thing to fear is fear itself. And the fear is not real. When it comes to the decentralized Bitcoin network that the Universe has provided...regulator are powerless. We will not fail this intelligent test.

That is one aspect of bitcoin you have pointed out clearly. Guess what? most people KNOW this about Bitcoin and only invest MATURELY what they CAN lose.
But guess what MOST people DONT know. That unlike BTC the OLD system of financials is UNFAIRLY based on the rule of 9. Whereby a company called a bank can CREATE out of thin are 9 times the amount of money they actually have, charge interest for this imaginary money that people have to actually pay back or have their HOMES taken. 
That people have to pay $3 a pop in order to get some of their own money.
That people under the old system are being told, like the are children that they can only get $400 a day of their own money as an allowance or something. 
That when there is a financial melt down, people can not have access to their own money because thanks to the rule of 9 and greed, their money is not there at all because they have loaned it all out, and thats why their allowance is now $20 a day. 
Give me Bitcoin any day. Lets just agree to disagree on which system has more respect for individuals and is a more mature choice for individuals. :-)

I was trying to find a simple converter to assist me when I am selling or buying Bitcoins, so I can easily figure out what percentage to markup and more importantly, exactly how much bitcoin to give or receive in the process. The math was difficult to remember as it has to go through a few phases, but overall its simple math.
I finally figured it out so I coded this in javascript and thought I would share it with the community if it would be of service. 
It gets the latest Bitcoin price from the LAST price API result from Bitstamp.net using Ajax to make a call, then it does the math to calculate the buy amount, the markup and how much bitcoin is to be received/provided.
Please use and share if it is useful. It is useful to me. Any polite feedback is welcome. If its solid, Ill consider placing it on Github and opensource it.

I agree. This is what guarantees that the price of Bitcoin HAS to skyrocket. As the dollar falters, which it will by the end of 2015 or at the latest early 2016, all this excess fiat dollars will FIGHT over Bitcoin ownership. And the rise in BTC price will be further facilitated by the greedy Wall Street types as they sell and buy. 
This is how I see it.

thank you very much. I have been out of the loop for a while and am just getting back and I had to say something about paying a $5 fee and waiting 2 hrs. Seems to me someone should just take the core code and change it to make it not based on miners but more where anyone can do proof of work and then everyone would be processing and making money "new mining" and problem would be solved. Seems like its just the proof of work part that has to be revamped. and if that new crypto coin is working then people would jump on board, no?

Whad good is 100,000 insurance if the banks feel they own your money and can deny you access to it. See what is happening in Greece. Where is their Insurance. Banks lend out 9 times more money than you let them hold. This is why they can not give everybody back their money. Its a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is yours and you always have access. If you invest a few grand in it now you will be a millionaire soon. It will skyrocket.

Did you notice the MANY 0.0001 BTC's being sent to that account? Isn't that the amount Miners get by default? Is this a miners account or something? Maybe a miners pool that was was also investing their monies? Why else would it have so  many small transactions of that amount? Just asking.

I assure you that I selected the lowest option available and there was even a message that said something like, "the fee has been increased to $5.24 because its the cheapest available in order to complete your transaction with miners" something like that. I assure you there was no other way or lower fee. Go ahead and try and send $180 on Mycellium app right now. Record it. Lets see please.
EDIT: I saw that in the settings I had it set to normal and there were 2 lower settings, economy and low priority. But the normal seemed to have like several fee choices as well so that is confusing. I thought that was all the choices. but for low priority it may be as low as you say, but there was a warning saying that low priority is still being tested and the transaction might never complete.  :-) that is not acceptable to me, so it seems like the $5 "normal" and waiting 2 hours, is the lowest reasonable fee transaction available.

I have to kinda agree. I was impressed with Stripe early on cause I thought they would expand and do more what people want and change things. But they basically are putting money first and have not changed anything much. They are basically like Paypal now. So I stopped using them also. They have coders and had an opportunity to support the Bitcoin community more but are choosing to follow instead of lead. They are tied to FIAT and bank accounts even though Bitcoin allows them to detach and enovate using cryptocurriencies instead of FIAT. It shows a lack of vision on their part which I didnt expect as their CEO guy seems like such an innovator. I was wrong. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:08:09
All banks are not in all cities. For instance There aint no Bank of Americas anywhere near me. A quick way of looking up bank locations by zip code would be neat. Enter zip and select bank and viola! nothing within 50 miles or display locations by closest. Right now we have to go search. This may help me decide, faster, which seller to go with. It simply saves time.

Of course why not. This is the only change I feel Bitcoin needs that was missing from Satoshi's version. Even if its a lottery where a node gets picked and gets a few bitcoin daily. The amount of nodes would take off like the Mining did. It would be more about us all and not just the miners. As the whole benefits, we all benefit. Riht now only miners are getting free bitcoins and it is supposed to be a financial system for all. The miners have become the new middle man it seems.

Also imagine if you are a miner and have nothing but Bitcoins.
Also Imagine if you get paid in bitcoins, mainy people do like 
Finally I offer this. You have millions or just what you consider a lot of money in FIAT cash, and you know for sure there will be a financial crash or default coming to CHina andthen the U.S. as many do...isn't it wise to be able to convert the cash now into Bitcoin so that:
* 1. You have access to it and and do not have to beg for your own money and only receive $20 a day after standing in long lines as we saw happen in Greece?
* 2. Lock in the value of the cash and convert to a non centralized currency like Bitcoin where you will be able to retain at least the current value, or benefit in the rising value of Bitcoin as FIAT crashes?
Its all about if you think its a good idea to SHORT the dollar right now. Lot of people see that as a win win. Nothing to loose as long as Bitcoin continues to stay alive.  Many have more faith in Bitcoin today than FIAT. By today's price they have more than $400 worth of faith.

I believe it would take more computer hashing power to do a 51% attack than what only 2 miners can bring to the table. According to the Satisohi papers and stuff I have read. Not certain though, correct me if i'm wrong but it takes a considerable amount of hashing power to do this within 10 minutes. Especially since the difficulty just doubled. :-)
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:36:09
The idea is that WordPress is a ton of PHP code that is open source and has many exploits so it is not wise to place it on your secure server that does financial transactions. A hacker gets access to the WordPress Database info which is likely the same DB used for Loanbase since its on the same server, so things can be altered in the database, like login info, and viola! if you do not have 2FA on, your money is gone. :-)
WordPress is awesome in and of itself though to be clear. I love it.

This would never happen in my opinion.
They have a monopoly on making money off a healthy and working Bitcoin Network. Why would they do something to hurt the network and make their position go away. They are just hurting themselves. If someone breaks the system people will go to another coin or network where they do not have the monopoly. 
So it is illogical. They would be biting off their nose to spite their faces. :-) or biting the hand that feeds them. see?
Finally, remember a 51% attack just gives you money, it does not take money away from others. So others will cash out or sell and now they are kings of a worthless network. :-)

Yes, very easily. Just request it on line and it is done instantly. You can go from a personal account to a business one in the click of a link.

They assign value and get things by providing a needed service. When they trade with other tribes , again its for a specific needed service, not just trading for the sake of trading so they can make a profit.

the code for Bitaddress.org, for their brain wallet, is in the source so you can just view the source. You can then just convert the steps into python, it should not be that difficult to go from Javascript to Python. The code is solid and has been reviewed by the entire planet.
The thing however though is that Brainwallets should not be used under any circumstances. This is something that has already been figured out by the masses. If you are thinking of building code to encourage people to use pass phrases to create their keys....well you are actually doing them a great dis-service. Please do not do that. Do some research on why this is an absolutely bad idea.

"Partners." And that tells it all. Coinbase is about big business and making money. That is the only reason one sells their soul and partners up with governments and bankers. 
They do have another option, which can lead to big bucks also, but its the road less traveled:
Create a new, decentralized system that supports the Bitcoin model of "unlimited" self control of ones money. Someone is going to do it, I assure you, if not me then someone else will. Who knows, maybe even someone named Satoshi is working on it as we speak. And one day we will wake up and check Reddit and see a post entitled "Please check out the decentralized version of Coinbase that I have created for the masses to be free."

woe! the obvious issue is that with an all electronic system, that does not have a blockchain for accountability, you have to 100% trust that the banking overlords will simply not just ADD more credits to their accounts and their friends. Everyone else works for the credits, and the overlords simply just create it by padding their accounts. With humans, power corrupts and ultimate power corrupts ultimately.
In other words, this is Swedes giving away their power to corrupt humans. Don't do it voluntarily Swedes. Wake up!

Why are you assuming that they would need him to be "dead" in order to pull this off? If he was alive, and they are monitoring this little "drama" of theirs, then one criteria of this mission could simply be to bring him out into the open. This would actually be a good way of doing this. Have someone pretend to be him and wait for him to object. And if he he is wise and does not take the bait, then plan B is to imitate him. 
Yes, it is out of integrity and all, but as a plan it is not the worst plan ever. But they have of course made some serious mistakes , like when they initially tried to fake stuff, but now they have regrouped and hopefully the new parlor tricks will make us forget the faked stuff. :-)

I do see your point, and it is a solid one for sure, if we are talking 100% secure etc. But with that line of thinking how can a person who desires this level of security even trust a 3rd party company like Mycelium who built the device anyway? At least with  my computer I can be in control of how secure it is etc, but by buying the device from Mycelium who has a another 3rd part build the hardware for them and then they in turn install the software, doesn't that also fail the 100% secure test?
Seems like for 100% secure Mycellium is not even close right? Very interesting.
@_date: 2015-11-21 02:04:13
Sure. A bank is centralized. Napster was centralized. So unjust laws had to be obeyed or the enforcers would swoop down and take your server and no more napster. Bittorrent came along using Peer to peer networks that hook up and form a decentralized network. No way to shut all of em down. System stays up and people can life and create freely and ignore unjust law.
Now coinbase is centralized and goes against the idea behind Bitcoin which is people being empowered to control their own money and finances without being monitored or controlled etc. By being centralized they have to ignore the core idea behind Bitcoin as I just stated because someone will remove their servers, buildings etc. Coinbase allows unjust laws to be enforced. 
SO when I say a decentralized coinbase, Im looking for a new decentralized way of doing what coinbase does. 
What is an unjust law? Any law that ignores the will of the people or limits an individual god given right of free will. This is just my opinion. I respect the opinion of others. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:31:52
My seal was also broken, but Mycelium support said just to download and reflash, which I did with little problem. Just that their instruction could have been a little bit simplier instead of, "follow the above steps but for step 4 and 5 do this instead," so I had to be going back and forth which is unneccessary as they just could have stated the 6 steps over again :-)
But I digress....They said after flashing its as good as new and there is no way anyone can alter it to work with their code, as it would error out, and I believe them So people are making this more than it has to be IMO. All is well. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:50:14
wow, people allowing their government to tell them what to do instead of doing what MLK and Ghandi did and change the government. All we have to do is not comply.

Stop following unjust laws, and anything that goes against what the people WANT to do is unjust.

exactly. The current system is only getting more and more like the OLD system of some bankers controlling currency policy. The whole idea of Bitcoin, to me, is that we remove humans, who can be selfish, OUT of the day to day equation. And miners are more and more in the day to day equation. It is understandable that Satoshi could not foresee this, no one could have really, but now that we know, lets adjust the protocol to be more HUMAN FREE, and where ALL Bitcoiners can do POW.

Occam's razor would imply that was simply the easiest method to code, with the same end result, a reduction in coins created. A slow reduction would have been much more of a challenge and may have obfuscated other things like soft and hard forks etc. 
The thing is, we can do whatever we want. His was just the first version. We can recreate and improve. As long as we follow the golden rule which is, that we do what is in the best interests of all concerned. This is what makes Bitcoin the spectacular thing it is. It helps a lot of people by empowering them. Provides a massive need.
