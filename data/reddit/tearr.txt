Gold, stocks, bonds, property and stuff like that would be wise to invest in.
Bitcoin would be way more intresting, but you have to understand the risk is real. I would invest a part of it in Bitcoin and the rest in other stuff, but everything out for fiat currency.

Let's assume the tip is appreciated by all receivers and givers, then there is two people who likes the comment (and possible verify comment). But there is thousands who see it, cluttering the place up making less space for actual insightful comments. If I remember correctly Bitcointip used to tell people to include a comment with your tip or send it as a private message if you have nothing to say. As well as that they had a limit for how little you actually could send.
In my opinion this led to more meaningful tips, and comments.

That is **not** one of the main arguements for bitcoin. You can send bitcoin freely for low or no fees. You can't buy bitcoin from some company and expect them to do it for you for free. 
Also Safello very clearly lists their buy and sell prices, so why you're sad that the company did exactly what they said they would do is beyond me. If you went into bitcoin to make money (which it seems like you did), you should spend 5 minutes to check the fees. Probably trade bitcoins instead of buying from a third party.
You didn't even use bitcoin (as you said in your title), you bought and sold bitcoin. If you buy a hamburger for 5 dollars and sell it for 10 later have you used the hamburger?

1. if you want cheap power it's a lot more about how you generate it and where the operation is located. Buying power in bulk might help slighlty, but getting cheap power from the start is better.
2. problem is you can't. there are three (maybe more?) companies making asic's today, and they can't ship fast enough to individual consumers. They would never go down in price just because you bought a bulk, as it is no advantage to them. The demand is just to big.
3. you don't need a lot of staff, so the savings are marginal.

Actually nobody wants more than 21 million bitcoins. It would be a disaster, people would sell in massive amounts crashing the bitcoin price, and removing the trust we had in the system.
The developers probably wouldn't be that dumb. More importantly if they were the miners wouldn't accept it. You have to remember that miners are often heavily invested in bitcoin themselves. It's much cheaper for them to go out of mining if the profits are to low rather than infalting the currency.

Anarchism is a social movement that seeks to abolish oppressive systems. Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of their community.
They aren't really anarchists. They just want to change some opressive parts of society and exchange it for others. You don't get a society like that unless it's completly voluntary or most people needs to be forced.

The fee is now 8 cent, In january it was 0.8 cent, and it used to be even less. The miners earn almost everything from the new blocks. The transaction fees are unimportant, for now. I've used 0.00005 lately, and if the price keeps increasing I will lower it even more soon.

Selling bitcoin, or buying stuff with bitcoin, means you end up with no, or low risk and a currency proved to work for a lot longer than bitcoin have. Keeping bitcoin means you keep the upside, but also the potential downside. Like a big crash which have happend twice already. Although the last crash was weak sauce.

The price isn't just about adoption. I would infact argue that current adoption is only a small part of it. Expected future value drives the price more than current adoption. Which means that bad news or good news change the price. Even if it doesn't change adoption.

If you mine alone you could hit a block in 5 minutes or 500 years. Everyone joins pools today, so you would probably get a few satoshis a day with your computer.

@_date: 2013-07-20 15:01:37
the price changes, but for now people ususally calculate the prices in another currency and pay with bitcoin. All done automatically for most payment solutions. But quite easy to do manually to. 
If bitcoin became a lot larger we might have sticky prices. Which is why you see prices stay the same for long periods of time despite fluctuations in regular currencies. And at that hypothetical scenario everything could be priced in bitcoin as the price would be the same even if there were fluctuations in bitcoin. But that is way in the future if we're lucky.

These swings are much lower than those in the past. And hopefully the swings in the future will be lower than those in the present.

yes, they probably already spy on your bitcoin. if you wan't to stay completely anonymous you need extra measures. For regular users not overly conserned about privacy a simple encryption of the wallet is enough.

Just because they have linked it doesn't make it a libertarian currency. It's just that libertarians and anarcho capitalists embraced the currenct early, and it fits very well for them. But that doesnt make it a purely libertarian currency. They also link to crytoanarchy and Crypto because those kinds of people got intrested early on, and it fits really well for them. But that doesn't mean people unintrested in this should feel left out.
