NSA of course can vote on anything. Question is, how do you vote? Anybody can vote on anything, here we vote on Bitcoin, in Litecoin they vote on Litecoin, and any alt coins have a voting process. And NSA may be willing to vote for R3 consortium's Super blockchain. If you don't like it, just fork it, then anyone will be voting on you, if they like. So it is just a working process, without it we simply cannot do anything, jointly. But it is not your understanding of governance, where people/users/clients don't have any choice but only obedience. In the world of crypto-currency, everyone absolutely have any freedom to select their best Bitcoin.

To be honest, there is not much to be done for the average Joe when concerning software development. Even working in this industry, if you are not an expert of a specific field, you could not say much about a particular topic without the risk of bringing shame on yourself. So stay calm, watch the progress of Bitcoin, examine any issues carefully which are concerning you, sometimes, they are neither black nor white, you have to consider pros and cons of a solution, as always.

@_date: 2016-01-20 09:32:24
Thank you brother, thank you very much for your valuable information. Your reply comes first somewhat makes me a little surprised. It seems that the whole community is furious about blocksize increase. So I decide to discuss the value and necessity of blocksize increase first. And in the coming days we will discuss the negative aspects of blockdize increase. I am expecting supporters to be vocal first, but maybe they are too busy with their "overwhelming" success?
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:58:01
To make myself clear, I'd like to state some of my view about those seemingly complicated debates about block size limit. Some people, the most obvious one is Roger Ver, and some big miners, don't care about mining centralization, about Bitcoin blockchain data increasing, about the danger of an increasingly centralized Bitcoin node tendency, even about the danger of a hardfork split.
I care about it, most Bitcoin nodes running SegWit wallets care about it, and the Bitcoin development community, all of them, do care about it. And some miners care about it too, so I'd call them honest, from the bottom of my heart!
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:13:03
I'd like to make myself more clear: I don't know why they wouldn't cooperate with us. Yeah, I am a Chinese Bitcoin fan and I see many many detailed information about what they say, what they do, many many interactions between them and the Bitcoin community here in China. I cannot get a fucking sense of rationale out of their behavior. All I saw is hate, arrogant, and disbelief.
And I never trust those big mining shots, just like you buddy, never trust big shots on Wall Street, before and after the sub-prime crisis in the year 2008. And That is why our beloved creator, Satoshi Nakamoto create the ingenious weapon against them: the Bitcoin.
The essential part, the very best part, and the soul of our Bitcoin system, is decentralization, for ever. That is why our development community is taking extremely cautious about any innovative steps which could impair this essentiality, even with the least possibility. I, and the most of the community, fully understand and appreciate it. But some of those big miners, don't.
And there are more: maybe mining centralization is a necessary evil, for the sake of efficiency. And maybe some forms of centralization, to some extent, such as Bitcoin exchanges, online wallet services, development companies just like Redhat in the Linux world, is inevitable, that doesn't mean we, as a whole community, would, should, and could let them carry it out to the extreme extent. It is the art of balance among all involving parties.
So never say that again, the bigger those miners, the more we should trust them. On the contrary, the bigger any party involved in the Bitcoin community, the more opposing to the nature of our Bitcoin system it will be, intentionally or unintentionally. We should take extremely cautious to those big shots involved in our Bitcoin ecosystem, any of them.
Thank you all, our Bitcoin buddies.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:36:39
Right, here the economic majority is all that matters, solely. Not miners, not developers, even not a small group of users. The economic majority, it's the key for a consensus system like Bitcoin to evolve, no matter in what form we make our steps forward.
And I think UASF is a better solution than a hash-algo PoW hardfork because it will protect those miners that work with us, it will not even cause any substantial damage to those miners, who don't agree with us at the beginning, but change their mind later on. Thus the UASF solution will conserve the strongest hashing power ever existing in the world. It is a far better solution to resolve divergence among us while keeping the loss of change at the minimum level. That is why I say it's good for all of us.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:41:35
No doubt there will be split, according to the history of ETH/ETC split and the shit attitude of Roger Ver and some big miners. I just want to make it clear that it is the end users of Bitcoin who decide. If those big mining shots want to stand opposing Bitcoin community permanently, we get a World of strength to stand with it.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:04:09
Yeah, "equilibrium", you are right. If we do not do anything now, we will get there in the end. So how long do you think we will reach the equilibrium? You say it is annoyng, so could I say it will be very soon now? Could you get us some concret data? Thank you very much.

So it is just a good, or maybe the word necessary is more accurate?, thing we need to do, sooner or later, I think. That is fine. Let's move on to Day1 question: 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:35:17
We, the end Bitcoin users who buy coins, at least most of us.
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:38:05
But it does opening a more wide attacking surface than a miners activated softfork, right? And I almost for sure someone will take advantage of it. Let's see...
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:22:36
I just propose an idea for discussion, especially meaningful at current situation of Bitcoin community. I don't mean we should do anything without fully discussion and detailed examination. But isn't it the time for us to discuss mining algorithm evolution and make mining activities re-decentralized, again?
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:11:53
You don't know what you are talking about yourself. Maybe I could give you some clues:
1 Bitcoin already has multiple client implementations, for years.
2 Anybody can join in the core development community, anytime. But who make decisions? Of course, not newcomers, at least before you make good enough contribution to the project and are accepted by other fellow developers.
3 You said something like Firefox and Chromium. So we follow your example, with some details: why do we need Firefox and Chromium? For web browsing, accessing Internet, etc. And why do we need Bitcoin and all these alt coins? Pay on the Internet. Now do you understand? We do have multiple developer community doing the same thing: developing all kinds of Internet money, i.e. all kinds of Bitcoins. So,
4 You, as an end user, do have all kinds of choices. If your transactions get stuck on the Bitcoin payment network, try an alt coin network. You, as a community developer, if not satisfied with this core community development strategy, fork it, just like what all these alt coins do.
5 If your Bitcoin fork does better, and all users out there think you are doing better than the original core development community, then your Bitcoin fork will prevail and become the de facto Bitcoin, yeah, the real Bitcoin.
6 Just trying to disturb the development community, then taking over control of it will not do. It's not the way an open source project works. On the contrary, You fork it, then do better than it, then other developers follow your project, then let users make their choices. That is the living style of an open source project, in the past, at present, and in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:31:43
We will get there (security vulnerabilities) in a few days later. But you said shilling, yeah, it is an interesting word. But could you provide some more details to backup your argument? Such as links to even this sub-reddit will be all-right if  we can learn something from it, as a good example of  shilling. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:41:50
I think rules enforced by nodes are what matters. Even a 10 percent hashing power support will do, the other 90 percent only compatible with old node software? So they have nothing to do with new nodes? Maybe they will try to use new node software to make an 51 attack on new node, but that will be another story.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:54:13
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:50:04
So the other way around could be possible too. That is, 
        If the price of the segwit-invalid coins becomes higher than the segwit-valid coins, then the segwit-valid coins will cease to exist because their chain will be re-org'd.
I'm all for SegWit and I do think UASF is, in the future a good approach for updating Bitcoin protocol consensus rules. But I do fully understand the wild dangerous inner and outer environment in which Bitcoin is evolving. Just like we cannot fully rely on miners to control updating rules, we cannot fully rely on those exchanges to determine which coin is more valuable.
You know today's exchanges do have very strong influence on Bitcoin exchange rate, especially short to medium term. And you do know some of them will do anything possible to make themselves more profitable than others, Poloniex' role during ETH/ETC split is a very clear example.
I'm not saying any of them is right or wrong. All of us here are for profit, and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin forces every partner involved to be honest, for the sake of their own interests.
But the reality is mining activity is centralized, and Bitcoin exchanges too, more than necessary. Also, you could say the same thing about our sub and Bitcoin forum, though I don't mind because they are at good hands ;-). Anyway, here is my humble opinion:
if you want to do something, in a consensus system like Bitcoin, only do it when absolutely necessary. Raising the transactions volume is good, implementing SegWit is good, hardfork to a 2M block size is good too, of course when we are ready!
But please do it when most of us involved are ready, all of the parties involved think it is a necessity. For example, although I think SegWit is absolutely the future of Bitcoin, Bitcoin revolution step 2, I don't think now it's the right time to get it activated, especially by force, especially many of us in the communities, including some big miners, are not fully understand and appreciate it.
I think it is very kind of our development community for continuously working on those technologies for a safe hardfork. When we are ready to do a safe hardfork, we do give our community a 2M block size update. By then, let's see what else reason those big miners could bring up to block the activation of SegWit.
And maybe better yet, during this process, let altcoins activate it first, maybe Litecoin, maybe others. Let's see who could stand the heat, eventually.
And you know, there is potential dangerous now, someone, want to take control of Bitcoin, by any means. As a consensus system, all we can do, is stick to our ground, firmly, prepared for any kind of attack. It's not a good time to make any consensus rules updating, it will open more attacking surface To those opponents. At present, no move, better move.

Brother, you bring up an interesting question, or make it clear, that who, the miners, or the users (including core development community), or both of them working together, to determine the future path of Bitcoin development. This topic is far more interesting, and important, than the block size limit debate.

Ah, his name is Huang Shiliang? I didn't know that before. Here is his [Weibo account]( something like a Chinese Twitter. He just got 1 million? Lucky guy, ain't worth a penny of it.

@_date: 2017-03-06 16:26:40
I'm sorry, but your answer is a complete mess. I only say most Bitcoin nodes do support SegWit while some mining big shots do behave inappropriate, or maybe hostile? And we do have plenty of ways to cope with that.

So here are two seemingly contradictory concerns about implementing Lightning Network thereafter. One is worrying about there will be not much transactions left on the main chain (the Bitcoin blockchain), because Lightning will 'take over' the Bitcoin for most transactions, thus threatening the Bitcoin safety eventually (the background logic is no transactions no fees, no fees no miners, and no miners no safety.).
On the other side, one could argue that by 'intentionally' keeping the block size small, the transaction fees happened on the main chain could skyrocket, thus driving even more people to Lightning, which deprive the ordinary people of the ability they have at present to transact on the main chain, and many people consider this ability as sacred as freedom of speech or something.
Thus they conclude Lightning Network must be the unrealistic (too ideal) pursuit of 'The Core', to keep Bitcoin in the purest form and as a geek product permanently, blindly ignoring the skyrocket needs of the current business. And some of them might go even further to conclude a conspiracy that 'The Core' want to make massive profit from Lightning because Lightning is centralized thus it's very easy for them to take control of people and make profits.
I know this is a bad question entangled with many things remotely substantial. But they spread widely on Chinese forums and cause some negative feelings about 'The Core', who, on the contrary, I think we should owe all of what we have at present to them, the development community.
Could someone kindly dismiss this misunderstanding carefully, one by one, with the layman's term, and better yet, with external links to justify the content, whenever possible and needed. I will give 0.1BTC bounty, not to value your continued priceless work here, but merely a little thank you, for a good answer.

7 billion is a big number, let's take a small step back. Say 1 billion is good, and there will be big players like Paypal, or maybe Coinbase is an equally good example. Each of them will get a customer base of 1 million on average, so we get 1 thousand company here. I believe most of transactions between a company and her customers will happen on Lightning.
Here is the question: how much transactions will actually occur on the main chain for such a company?

We all know our whole Core development community, and not any single person, have ever said something like that, 'CORE will leave blocksize at 1MB forever'.
Just as one of specific examples from many people, Mr. Gregory Maxwell, [nullc]( has explained his, and also shared by most of us, intention about the path of Bitcoin scaling road map. Here is the link:

In the future, if most transactions happened on the Lightning Network and the block size kept small, such as below 300k, it is good for full node users, but will miners' profit not be enough to maintain the security of the Bitcoin network? 
Because block mining reward will diminish and in the end miners will have to depend solely on transaction fees to keep their business running. Do we have to worry there will not be enough transactions on the blockchain? Thank you very much.

Don't get me wrong, I am a small blocker in my heart, because I want to run a full Bitcoin node on my home computer forever. Without running a full node of my own, you know, my money is actually not my money, indeed.

No, no, no, you (maybe deliberately?) confuse Hashcash with PoW. How do you get a trustless PoW? Not all PoWs are trustless. See below quote:


You see, Hashcash, as a form of PoW, does form the cornerstone of Bitcoin, while other PoWs, are NOT. You just cannot get rid of the decentralized property from Hashcash to make it look like the same as other PoW algorithms. Far from them.
The decentralized property is an absolute requirement in a trustless currency system like Bitcoin, from every aspect of it. We need a trustless PoW (Hashcash), we need a trustless database, 'a decentralized central database', i.e. a P2P network hosted blockchain, and we need miners to put those transactions into this blockchain, trustlessly.
So you cannot simply say Satoshi use PoW to reach consensus. That is very, very, over-simplified and misleading. We need decentralized Bitcoin nodes to form a P2P network, with Bitcon blockchain deployed on each and everyone of them, we need Hashcash, as the backbone of the currency, and we need miners to take advantage of the Hashcash, to do PoW, AND in a decentralized/trustless way.

I am sorry, but I don't quite get what you mean here, it is quit counter-intuitive, or maybe I just misunderstand what you mean here. Do you mean empty blocks don't impair the transaction throughput of the network? What if all of them miners did start mining empty blocks without including any transactions in them? Won't the whole Bitcoin network process any transaction at all at last? Thank you.

And it's not a big deal, for Chinese, and for Bitcoin, we all know that... Otherwise the Chinese Government will shut down all those Bitcoin exchange websites, as you have already seen in other fields of the market.

Thank you very much. And I did some formatting for your answer, if you don't mind.

Because he could buy more hash power to block segwit code activation, 'permanently', though I don't think that's his truly intention.
@_date: 2016-12-31 20:49:57
And with all these above said, and with all my respect to Dr. Back, for his brilliant work on Hashcash, I do NOT see his fame has anything to do with a hard-fork to a different mining algorithm. That's not the thing that he, or anyone in the community could determine, SOLELY. Because:
1 Changing mining algorithm is absolutely a very dangerous, if not devastating, step which should only be used when absolutely necessary, as a last resort; and
2 It can only be allowed by the consensus of the whole community, not as something could be conducted by some individuals, even important ones, EASILY.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:54:11
It's OK. Just leave them alone, ain't got time to waste. We got much more interesting things to do.

We, as a community here, all want the long term success of Bitcoin. If some of us could not catch up with others idea, it's kind and also good for our own interests to help each other. Anyway, Bitcoin is still so 'young' and so advance that even the very few people in the community, not all of them will get exactly idea about what is going on.


Maybe you mean a small blockchain is better? If so, may I say, bigger block small block are all blocks, no matter which one we prefer, we need to confirm others, or better yet, confirm ourselves, with a good reason, isn't it?
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:00:20
This really hit the spot. I know a bad question is really not that 'bad', because you will get many good answers despite whatever you ask.
Actually I didn't ask the question you just answered, directly. But it's really the true question lying behind - what are those miners thinking about the Lightning is all that matters, at present. They are now lagging behind for whatever reasons and we have to make better communication with them and convince them Lightning is at least equally as good as Bitcoin itself, not only for the end user, but also for them. Thank you very much.

You know, the better a new evolution it may be, the bitter it is attacked, as always in history, in any country. The model of the universe from Nicolaus Copernicus is a good example. So not too surprised…

You are building a professional layer between end users and the underlying Bitcoin network infrastructure, so that protecting both sides of involved parties. This is the best Bitcoin use case I have ever seen. Congratulations and keep on the good work, thanks!

Is it something remotely similar to Ethereum?

I think a pruned node might consume even more resources from the whole network than normal nodes, without any significant giving back to the network, as every time a wallet software major update, you have to re-download all these 80+ GB blockchain data, right? Although a pruned node cut out most of its hard disk space usage, it greatly burdens the whole Bitcoin network traffic?
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:58:44
It is the very same beloved Bitcoin, and much better... ;-)
@_date: 2016-10-15 18:27:03
Absolutely no data. They just shout aloud to make an illusion they are strongly supported, but they aren't.
It's purely FUD. They just want to bring chaos to here then make advantage of it. ETH/ETC fiasco happened recently is a very good example, although it would be just a miniature of what should happen, if they got their way and split Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-11 02:37:52
Good point. Better yet, maybe shouldn't go that far yet. It is probably most of those involved should be reasonable enough to let themselves be kicked off market - they are losing their hashing power rapidly right now by last 24 hours. Let's see what will be going on next.
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:22:05
So what's your supporter's politics? Politically divides the community and makes other valuable developers politicians too by distracting them from their actual daily work? Yeah, that is what I see as inevitability of politicians.

Never banned in China, but almost all of pipelines to deposit money from banks to major exchanges were cracked down, once upon a time. But from the end of last year, all of pipelines are re-opened, all of sudden, under the strategy of supporting financial innovation

I agree with you, as far as decentralization is concerned.
Since the bitcoin/bitcoin repository is just one opinion of what Bitcoin is, then those core developers involved in this particular project can, and should do anything they see fit, like any other developers will do in any other open source projects, including other implementations of the Bitcoin protocol.
So what's wrong when core developers revoke someone's commit access to their repo when they think this person is not competent for his work, especially after years of no contribution to the project?
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:11:48
So any ordinary reference core clients without this patch will not be compatible with these BIP148 nodes after August 1st, right? I think this situation is not acceptable, because then this soft fork in effect is as forcing as a hardfork and will cause a lot of panic. I think BIP149 is a far safer approach.
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:16:40
Money, especially a lot of money, is more toxic than anything else...
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:22:27
We do be expecting BIP91, aka BTC1 does actually work in the end, more than any other miners, do we? ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:14:01
The much much larger community and ecosystem. For example, you can compare the number of core developers on GitHub.com, subscribed readers and online users on Reddit.com, and hash powers protecting blockchains between Bitcoin and Litecoin, the largest alt-coin.
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:29:29
I am totally confused by these old/new blocks and 2mb/4mb things. Could you provide some more details or reference materials (links)? Thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:08:40
Thank you for clarifying this thing. I understand it now.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:14:15


Their power is given by the community, their branch (Bitcoin core project) is supported by the community, and they will do any change which is truly wanted by the community. You may think your change in your branch the most wanted, then ask the community to support your branch. That's all.
@_date: 2016-07-25 03:14:04
No dilution? You mess up everything then walk away, and tell me no dilution? The community will be split and market confidence for the coin will be smashed deadly.
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:53:34
Is orphaned blocks number a good indicator of mining centralization issue? i.e. more orphaned blocks mean more mining centralization and vise versa? Are there any better indicators? What make small to medium miners/pools to be at a more disadvantage position? Is it highly related to bigger blocks? I am very sorry to put forward so many questions at once, as I am discussing block size increasing road map with my country fellow members. They think a 2M increase provided by SegWit may be not enough, and want another 2M increase through raising block size limit.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:56:36
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:35:22


Would you kindly give some detailed reference links or examples of these improvements? Thank you very much.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:42:45
So if we say at present, with 1MB block fully filled with typical transactions, the network can process 1,000 transactions  per day, then after SegWit is fully adopted by ALL of the end clients, how much by then typical transcations can the network process? 1,700, 2,000, or even more transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:22:27
We do be expecting BIP91, aka BTC1 does actually work in the end, more than any other miners, do we? ;-)
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:46:22
I don't think so. But I do think, both bigger block supporters and opponents should provide more concrete and easy understanding data/examples/tests to backup their arguments. This is a very important issue that has long consequences. We should make everybody in our community understand the pros and cons involved, as clearly as possible. The more people understand our development community work, the more solidarity our Bitcoin community will be.
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:00:30
Yes they do. Especially in IT industry, in open source ecosystem. Gavin himself as a perfect example?
