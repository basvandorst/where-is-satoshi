I liked that comment :)

You win. Seriously, well done.

Well, depends if the dog is cute or fun? 
Check out the wiki to see why I asked... and be prepared to have your life changed. 
**A few years ago someone named Max started "Humanity": A company owned by YOU and every person in the world. It'd first project is the NEW Internet that will change the course of history forever. It is a "sister company to Google" worth  "billions of dollars" and supported by the likes of Elon Musk, Tim Cook, and probably Superman himself...**
Haven't heard of it? Neither has Elon Musk, Google, or anyone else... despite a single possibly delusion persons 10,000 hours of work, hundreds of unfulfilled promises, and 100+ Facebook accounts for all of the companies products (ranging from a social network to hardware/OS's to free worldwide education)! 
It's like jumping down a rabbit hole to watch a train wreck. Definitely start with the wiki on @_date: 2015-12-17 11:35:15
Max?

FYI I can speak for the Midwestern USA and say people have no negative feelings about Mongolia and do not view it as a third world country.
And not all of us like Trump :) 
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:42:54
They do that on purpose, no? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:44:57
Yet...

Uhh services don't seem shut down? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:17:38
Source of video? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:33:01
Nobody knows when, if, or to what extent it will increase. That's the whole point and is the **exact reason** people can even make or lose money in the first place. 
Again, if people knew when and how much the value would increase or decrease, no one would ever lose (nor make) money. That is a very basic principle you seem to forget, nothing is certain. 
**You know all this technical jargon and information, but are missing/forgetting the big picture. The whole point is this type of stuff cannot be known ahead of time.**
Nothing is certain, you need to understand, recognize, and accept it. If not, then in my opinion your in denial, a sign of a larger problem (e.g. Gambling). 
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:08:13
Oh awesome (about video link). Not awesome about the money. 
What possible justification could they have? Did you record the phone call? Almost sounds like there is a part of story missing (just because it's insanely unethical and wrong if true).

So dude just never shipped and kept the $1800? Wonder if any Redditors in Bloomington Indiana could help you out. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:43:17
Shocking to find you here! I read this post and thought about you immediately. 24 more hours of hell, still procrastinating. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:45:59
That's what I was thinking. Hopefully it won't come to that 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:57:05
So you taking taking him to court? I'll represent you in person this summer for $500! Only $250 if you lose. 
:) 
(assuming you don't live in US)
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:42:05
I think you have a chance actually. Lots of bright caring people in the BTC community. Besides, make a police report and your investigating a crime.

Are you still saying that email didn't come from Circle? :)
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:54:09
It says it is from customercare sure it's legit? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:10:29
Ah, your tone changed. First it was I made it up, now it's Circle is wrong. Will you admit to being wrong about its legitimacy if I post the header? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:18:08
He is just a jerk and bully who feels better about himself trying to be an internet asshole. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:19:48
Am I still lying? Is everyone still lying?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:12:53
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:41:19
Wait, I wasn't saying anything about Circle. I haven't been following BTC too closely and received this email. Don't think I even have coins with them, but will move them if I do. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:29:55
I did post the header, and you still are saying it is not from Circle. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:52:10
It took me a few min to post it but I did search first. Header coming 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:17:34
I posted it but you still won't believe me. You my friend are what I call a jerk and bully. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:28:54
You are still implying it didn't come from Circle even though the proof YOU asked for was posted? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:31:09
Apparently. 
Not sure why I got so mad, but he was such an asshole from the start and I didn't do anything to him! I was trying to help report Bitcoin news in a Bitcoin subreddit and he comes out swinging.
i have been a Redditor  for many many years - and he finally got me super angry for the first time. 
He is a 2 month troll and I let him bother me. I feel dumb. 
Still funny how he is implying it didn't come from Circle...
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:56:37
Well someone else will post it shortly, then you will admit I wasn't lying? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:57:20
Figuring out how 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:59:04
Good idea. Done 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:25:37
You sound like Trump or something...
First you said THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS LEGIT - ITS SPAM.
Now you are saying "Well...circle is still wrong". 
Just admit you were wrong...
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:01:06
Can't figure it out on Android, won't go in desktop mode. Any tips 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:05:22
As I stated I am trying to figure it out. Just grabbing my laptop. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:16:35
He still thinks I am lying  - not sure why Yoda is being such a jerk...seriously what is up with him?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:26:29
Why did he have to be such as asshole to someone who was trying to help?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:04:07
Why are you being so mean. I'm trying to view the header on an Android phone but it's not working. Why are you being so hostile 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:04:30
Will you apologize if I am proved right? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:52:52
It really really appears to be from Circle? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:26:03
So you are still implying it is not from Circle?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:15:39
Are you happy now? Please don't let me get doxxed - please tell me if this contains any personal info. Obviously I am not super good with this stuff.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:41:28
Referring to comment OP made 
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:39:30
Nice 
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:02:52
I'll take it.  I want it 
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:11:49
And if he acted like an arrogant jerk like in this thread then it probably didn't help. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:26:12
If true wouldn't it be worth paying someone a small percentage to help brute force or otherwise figure it out? 
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:48:58
Send me $80 in gold and I'll get you $161 in $PRAY.

One person, who was immediately downvoted stated it was unfair... 
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:49:37
It's a duck 
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:01:36
It looks like only two or three people believed you? The rest called it BS? Or am I missing something? 
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:42:27
You didn't need to reply? 
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:49:54
Not everyone reads this subreddit on a regular basis. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:22:25
Are you sure it was a legitimate Microsoft run service and website? Possible you were phished or scammed? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:08:35

@_date: 2016-12-09 00:11:03
Wait isn't changetip closing? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:17:04
Serious question,
Why should I care about one man's opinion?
Or is it just a fun exercise? 
To be honest he seems like a lunatic sometimes.
(I am NOT trying to seem cool or over important, just genuinely curious why I should care at all about his prediction.)
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:28:11
I thought the exact opposite... What great customer service. They added it to the FAQ, refunded him, let him know they are, apologized, and asked for more feedback. What else could you want? 
(btw I don't even own BTC and have no attachment to Bitpay). 
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:26:18
NWIGHT SCHRUTE
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:58:17
No he clearly did not say that 
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:50:38
Why is this the ONE chance to take power away from central banks? Can no other possible coin, movement, method, etc. ever do this in the future? How does one determine that no chance will ever happen again? 
Seems like a false dilemma or something to me (but that does NOT mean the rest of your post loses its merit).   
Also, I realize you are likely just adding that for effect or to 'rally the troops' and do not mean it literally - in that case ignore this post. :) 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:32:52
Ah, that makes sense. I just closed my account gave my 8 cents to charity (didn't even look up the other org I gave it to either). 
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:55:25
Damn, just spent five minutes writing this same thought as a comment only to scroll down and see your post. Boo. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:01:06
He's saying they are playing it safe and possibly labeling it wrong - don't shoot the messenger. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:09:59
Why is the picture altered? 
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:53:51
What is viaBTC ?  
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:17:38
I see what you did there 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:15:43
Huh? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:15:22
He will lose his reddit account basically. He won't be able to post anything without people calling him out and downvoting everything he writes.
Not exactly a huge consequence, but an annoyance especially if he enjoys subs that require a karma count or if enjoys an already existing reputation associated with his current username.
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:20:20
Huh? Why? 
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:59:25
Really? 
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:10:48
Question, are you new to this subreddit? I think I would have treated your post a bit differently if I knew it wasn't just some random shill who will never post again. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:12:06
Don't their profits have to end up somewhere though? i didn't mean to start a witchhunt against you - my rants were related to the subreddit as a whole. Your post was just the most recent (and came from a new user) so I went on the attack.
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:17:59
Genesis is dangerous. just ask Kirk 
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:17:29
Your paper writing will go much smoother if you find the references and sources yourself. Reddit is a decent place to start, but don't simply use this list as it stands. You may find it doesn't have the information you need/want, and it will take much longer to go through.
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:00:33
Ah, I understand much better now! I probably was too quick to dismiss your post as FUD, but err on the side of assuming stuff is BS.
Unfortunately I don't think we will know what these coins are from exactly and how they are being used - at least until after Agora as a marketplace ceases to exist for whatever reason.

Such wishful thinking. Pure BS. (But I hope he's right.)
EDIT: I take it back. He is saying an impossible scenario where history literally repeats itself exactly. The opening line clearly shows even he doesn't believe it will happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:40:11
Websites like the daily dot seem to only cover Reddit stuff lol. I guess that's what I was thinking of. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:32:29
Wow that's like 
$500-$600?! And the publicity this is and will be getting will do many more times good. I wouldn't be shocked if you got a PM or two from reporters or bloggers. 
I work with food pantries and recently had a pantry have 6 freezers worth of meat stolen. The resulting publicity and donations did so much good it far outweighed the loss. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:33:02
:) we need more people like you!! 
However keep in my end that money can go so much further than food. 
Most pantries (or food banks where I work who supply the food pantries) can get $8 worth of good for every $1.
Not to minimize what to do at all- cause it's awesome, it really helps both in the food and the awareness aspect! But just an interest in factoid. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:16:59
Good job SNOE! How much money in tips have you made since returning the money? 
I think you should be rewarded with even small amounts for that.
