The standard for evidence remaining the same for both conviction and defense is unnecessary, there is not a chance in hell of **ever** changing that, nor should there be for the sake of justice. Otherwise we lose the presumption of innocence.
You are *already* presumed innocent, hence the evidence has to be supplied by the prosecution that you are guilty of a crime, not by the defense that you are innocent, and that evidence can then be challenged.

You are ignoring the fact that the blockchain makes tracing coins fairly trivial, add to that the fact that they had vendors PC's/laptops in their possession also would mean that they could probably trace the commissions paid by the vendors to DPR's wallet.
I mean the fact is he was accessing the SR admin panel whilst on public wifi in a library, used email addresses tried to his identity in domain registrations linked to SR points to a man with virtually no OPSEC whatsoever, so the likelyhood of him using a tumbler or similar highly unlikely.
So they don't only have the SR servers, they have his personal laptop with incriminating evidence on it, as well as physical and digital evidence from vendors **and** have managed to gain the co-operation of the vendors they arrested as well there is a high probability that they have an ample evidential chain from vendor, to SR, to Ross.

Forget the who was the *mouthpiece*, it's who has the purse-strings and proceeds / commissions from SR that will matter, and with having SR's / Ross's wallet(s), and busted vendor wallets, AND the Silk Road tumbler in possession there is a very high likelyhood that simple blockchain analysis will point to whoever gained the proceeds during the time in question, the blockchain is a ledger after all and if you have both ends of a transaction it shouldn't be too hard to connect the dots.
Karpele's has also denied that he tipped them off to Ulbricht last night, he said last night that reports of Ulbrichts arrest were the first time he heard that name, and it's not unreasonable to conclude that should he have been the one to tip them off, he'd either be giving evidence himself as a witness or that fact will come out later in the trial.
Of course it's not impossible that rather than giving them a name, he pointed to something that **led** them to Ulbricht, but again, that's something that will later come out in court if it's what led them to him.

No, because I think the feds investigating him and moving onto another suspect indicates that it's highly likely he wasn't DPR.
I get that the humor element is driving a lot of posts on r/bitcoin about this, but beyond that I think they got the right person with Ulbricht and this is just an attempt by the defense to sow reasonable doubt, not to seriously accuse Karpeles of being DPR or behind Silk Road.
I don't even think that by the end of the trial that this will even be enough to meet the standard of reasonable doubt. (There's a difference between "reasonable doubt" in the legal sense and just "any doubt at all" ).

It is prudent, but it relies entirely on the prosecution having a weak hand.
The stronger the prosecutions evidence, the more this type of defense works *against* the defendant.
It's such a weak defense overall that it is lampooned internationally with the famous refrain of *"It wasn't me, Guv'nor!"* (As a Brit would say) or Bart Simpsons *"I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it!"* or one of the many other regional variations.
I mean as well as stating that it wasn't him, he's going to have to explain how he ended up with DPR's Bitcoin wallet, the written journals detailing his activity, the screwed-up paper on his bed with notes about SR's rating mechanisms, and who the hell knows what else they have. They also have all the evidence collected from the vendors that were burned, all they need to do is trace the bitcoin commission from a vendor to Ross's wallet using the blockchain during the time he denies he was in control and it all comes crashing down for the defense again.
Whilst the Pro-Ross crowd are celebrating this as some kind of victory, they are missing the simple fact that despite investigation they did not arrest and charge Mark Karpeles, nor ask the Japanese authorities to do so so whilst he was a suspect, he was one they later moved on from,as is common in any investigation.
It's as if people honestly believe the stereotype of all investigators being keystone cop level fools, easily thrown off the scent with a denial and a finger pointing by a suspect.

Open source does not mean safe and closed source does not mean unsafe, to equate open source as safe simply because it is open is circular logic and heavily faulty.
In fact open source software relies on the ideal of "many eyes" to provide some degree of safety, where a critical mass of developer numbers and activity is required before safety is approached, and even *then* security has to be a design goal and focus of the applications developers for this to be effective.
For instance, your application relies on Spark, how aware are you of the current exploits / attack vectors that Spark is at risk from? Just for starters...(Please don't say zero, I can think of one attack vector for Spark without even going to google.)

You are six months+ behind the understanding of the current HF proposals and their effect on decentralization.

The EDA is **why** there will need to be a HF.
The scenario was predictable (*and* predicted) - Miners game the difficulty to drop it to silly levels, mine fast blocks until eventually the 2016 block adjustment kicks in and the smart miners then drop out waiting for others to drop the difficulty via EDA for them again, when they then jump back in and profit until the next 2016 block upwards adjustment.
The oscillations will become somewhat predictable, in a stable-ish 'fast down / slow up' cycle, making gaming the difficulty more profitable that simply mining.

The knock on effects of the DAO hack had just about **all** cryptocurrencies revisit the value proposition of immutability, that, IMO, was pretty damned influential. :P

So it's finally sunk in for Olivier how nodes enforce consensus, took long enough, but it's a bit late to try and get that genie back in the bottle now. 
Can't get the network support from nodes he needs, so attacks the idea of a node network instead, a very Olivier thing to do.
Everything he posts is so transparent, He should change his middle name to Telegraph. :P

More than just tax, the UK's gaming laws are quite specific on lotteries and raffles and the requirements to run one legally.
Source: Worked for someone who decided to raffle off their house, watched the whole process from when they started to the eventual legal fallout when they failed to deliver on the draw date. 
(No-one working for them thought they would do this, as everything up to that point had been kosher and legally sound.)

It was a naked and obvious attempt at political manipulation of the Bitcoin blocksize debate by Coinbase, everything about the post, its timing &amp; BA's comments at the time made that obvious.
Given Ethereums recent "issues" it is hardly surprising that they want to sweep that episode under the rug.
Maybe they have wisened up to the fact that sometimes, not wading in and wrestling in the mud over contentious issues is generally better for business. :P

[removed] means it was deleted by a moderator (or the Auto-mod), It wasn't deleted by Greg.
And because it wasn't deleted by Greg, it's still in his comment history for anyone and everyone to read if they want to.
Greg posted the name of someone who was involved with scammers, and the name of the scammers company, there was NO online identity referred to in the post, which would be necessary for it to have been a "doxxing"
Here's the comment":

In the same way that a photo of you isn't "you", an uploaded version of you won't be "you" either.
There will never be a method of transference of actual consciousness from body to machine, Creating a simulcra that "lives on" might be interesting I guess, at least for those AI's and simulations, but those won't be you, no matter how much they act or respond like you.

Define "Last Long"...
It might take hours, days or even weeks for the forking to be settled, you won't need a window *that* long to take advantage.
Even a window of only *minutes* can and will be used by enterprising types to profit on the hard fork scenario.

But an online wallet does away with the idea of "holding it yourself".
For me, as a non-bitcoin user the answer is simple, it offers me nothing I can't already get from using my banks debit card and/or cash from a quick trip to an ATM. In fact it offers me much **much** less utility.
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:12:50
Yeah, with the amount of fraud and identity theft going on today I **like** knowing that my banks default position is suspicion, rather than laxity.
Most people will gladly accept such inconviences as a consequence of greater security for their account.

BIP91 isn't a hard fork, the only hard fork that meets the criteria for a chainsplit at this time is BitcoinABC / BitcoinCash, who have said they are going to fork if segwit activates. (In fact, I believe they have even set a date for the fork)

I know the pros &amp; cons of Eastern Europe quite well (European myself), but lets be frank here.
When you say "don't display your wealth openly" you *are* understating matters a little, he honestly would not have been able to enjoy the fruits of his labor much without doing so and then standing out, either he hired his own protection and played the game *properly*, or wolves would have seen him as a sheep and treated him accordingly... True?
You and I know that's true, he'd have had to have lived as a nomad and moved constantly, or set down roots and protected his own ass, and he didn't have the chops for either.

I think a more accurate title would be:
*"Ross Ulbricht got a fair trial. (but not a good defense)"*
Not sure if it's because of the cards Dratel had in his hand (deuce high!) or what, but it was a flawed defense from day one and went down from there.

If they are not gone / busted by feds, then isn't it possible that they are panicking about the fork?
I mean if their running fractional reserve, wouldn't users trying to deal with their coin splits from the upcoming fork expose that fact?
Just wondering aloud...
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:02:50
Yep, just finished it ( tweeted it earlier).
Makes for fascinating reading, if only for the way he Judge uses it to attack Dratel and his strategy.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:42:40
There is little doubt in my mind that *something* between the admission of the Iceland server evidence and the start of the trial scuppered / changed the defenses strategy, it's the only thing that explains the haphazard way in which it was conducted and as the Judge put it their "attempt at trial by ambush".

Yes, Coinbase have learned from the ETH/ETC split situation they suffered and got out ahead of it proactively this time instead by providing adequate notice of their intent.
