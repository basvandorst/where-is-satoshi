I prefer to live in the present. If you look too far into the future, you're going to end up losing money because "someday" we'll make a new all time high. Hopium is a hell of a drug.

Why not learn simple support and resistance on high time frame charts to know when to accumulate more and when to take profits to buy back in later when the price is cheaper. You can make 2-5 trades a year and be profitable.

The thing is Hodlers don't sell during corrections. Why willingly let your money go down 30-40% when you can sell and buy back in getting 30-40% more bitcoin without having spent any extra money?
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:30:53
But a bunch of people simply stating that we're going to $20k+ without evidence is more believable right? TA may not be 100% accurate but it's better than buying and hoping the price will continue to go up and then reading some BS news article telling you why the price went down. In technical analysis you can do everything right, making no mistakes at all and still lose. It's not about making flawless streaks of trades, it's about making sure your wins are bigger than your losses. Keep in mind I didn't say having more wins, you can lose more trades than you win and still be profitable if your wins are 20%+ and your losses are 1-3%.

Well I'm not even white and I still feel better using Gab than I do twitter, at least conservatives have a voice. Are you sure it was white nationalism or just nationalism because regular nationalism is okay. I'd even call myself a nationalist. I'm pretty sure what you saw was harmless and if it was a racist nazi post what were the comments?
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:36:43
Like I said I would still buy nice things, but things that to me would be worth the money. There's a $20,000 tv that's less than 50in I would love to own for example. I don't like the idea of just wasting money even if I had a lot. I grew up appreciating what I had and even though I'm currently financially stable I still don't buy useless crap. Like I said though, to each their own. I wouldn't prevent my kids or wife from owning a lambo. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:04:26
Why are people bringing politics into this? Well, since it's here I may as well say that the left seems to consider anything right of center as "far right" or "alt right". I use gab because of the free speech, guess that makes me a Nazi?

Now you're grouping all of the right with white supremacists? "Destroyed the last shreds of respect I had for the right. You're all insane" and be honest, you didn't have any respect for the right before making that post. I never said those types of people don't exist, it's to be expected in a 100% free speech site. I don't agree with what they say but I will fight to the death their right to say it, sound familiar? This is a liberal belief but not in today's fascist far left world. The modern left wants to censor speech, take our guns, and tell us what we can and can't do, that's fascism.
Also I'm not jealous of white culture, looks and intelligence. Not sure where you got that idea, do you think I agree with what those posts say? No, you see the right does a pretty good job of separating ourselves from the far right extremists. The left on the other hand seems to have become the far left which are the communists, socialist, fascists,  and that's why people are leaving the left. I guarantee you see the whole right as a bunch of heartless racists who want poor people to suffer, you've been brainwashed to think that way of us. It's how the leftist mainstream media always project us when it's far from the truth. They pull on your emotions to make you feel angry at us for being greedy racists, they make you feel angry at us for all the victims of shootings and people being blocked from entering the country illegally. You've fallen for their spell and fight a cause the majority of the country are against.

@_date: 2019-01-23 12:10:28
Even if they know about it and want to take it they won't know how much you own. You could always store it as a privacy coin and sent like 90% of it to a secret wallet while they take only 10% that as far as they know is all you own. Not saying that I've done this or anything but it is a backup plan of mine just in case.

Depends, my reasoning for buying this TV isn't because it's expensive or because I want to show it off. If I'm going to buy a TV, I want the best. Any car I buy that's not the Lambo could be seen as a luxury simply because of the price however a luxury is something you don't necessarily need. I will need A tv and I'd be buying the one that best suits my needs and interest. Plus I could use it at its full potential at all times.

Don't get me wrong, I'd still buy nice things but I wouldn't buy things that are expensive just because they're expensive. What use is a lambo if I can't use it to its full potential. The only reason to buy it is to show off how much money I have.

Have you actually been on the site or do you just read what other people say about it?

I'm explaining why I personally wouldn't buy one, everyone here is getting butthurt because they assume I'm talking about everyone. I'm starting to think though that it's deeper than that, like I'm exposing people's lust for things they don't really need. Why else would people take this so seriously, the majority of people in this world have little to no self control. Most people who win the lottery lose it because they're irresponsible. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:19:22
Don't forget the insurance. With the money for a lambo buying the kind of car I want, I'd still have more left over to put to better uses and with that insurance money cover my healthcare. People talk crap about the rich all the time and now we get crap for wanting to use our money wisely if we were rich? Like I can't be happy being rich of I don't buy a bunch of useless luxuries? Instead of a mansion I'd build an efficient and secure house with all the things I need and want without any of the stuff I don't.

I noticed when I started seeing links to Wikipedia articles on right wing videos, Google claiming them as conspiracy theory videos. After that I personally stopped donating to them for supporting Google's agenda. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:09:21
I don't know, I didn't read that but I shared it because it's the only thing I could find that explains Google's intention. That news site is politically biased on Google's favor so it would most likely view it as a good thing. The links weren't just links it was a mini article right under the videos, impossible to miss. There's no way Google could have done that without getting any kind of permission from Wikipedia.

I believe in function over form. I try to find the things that work better over what looks better. The best things are what have the perfect mix of both, if it does everything it's supposed to while still looking nice. Exotic cars are form over function, they have great performance but you can never take advantage of that, plus the cost of maintenance and driving carefully to not scratch or damage because of the looks. Speed bumps seem to be an issue for expensive cars for example, why handicap myself to protect the look of my car when the only reason to keep it looking good is to please other people. I would rather buy the best car for me that has the right mix of form and function, but that's just me. To each their own.

It's annoying but in the end the misinformed and uneducated are the ones who lose. I guess going from like $2 to $20k in a few years is nothing but bitcoin dropping a thousand in a few days is big in your face news, even if you saw it coming and shorted and now have more bitcoin.

I'm lucky to have gotten into bitcoin after the ATH and not during. It would have been nice to get in before but the way I see it, I'm in before the next ATH. Why am I lucky? Because from what I can tell the majority of people who got in before and during December of last year seem to be really bad at predicting when bitcoin will rise or fall next. I bought my first satoshis in late January, I remember the price being 11k and a week later dropped down to 6k. I only bought about $500 at first and bought $1000 right before it went back up. I learned am important lesson not to hodl and even after all the drops this year I'm still up.

First 3 panels are based on technical analysis of 3 different time frames, RSI is used in the TA however for overbought and oversold conditions we use a different indicator. The lower the panel the stronger the signal.

We used the Mayer Multiple as a base for this value but it's not the same. The indicator itself isn't ours but we are using it in this case to show our value through the course of bitcoin's life. Unfortunately I cannot share how we get to our number only that it is based on the mayer multiple.

I bought on the 14th and sold sold last night on the 19th which is why the bottom panel on that day is red. I had drawn an Eliot Wave pattern and what I thought was wave 5 was actually just the end of a wave 3. I still made some pretty good profits. I don't use stop losses because I always fall victim to stop loss hunters so that also hurts my profits a bit but overall I'd say it's very good.

Well, all I'll say is I hope you have enough evidence to support your claim. You wouldn't want to succumb to confirmation bias. We haven't had a real bounce for awhile and everything is oversold, we're due for a bounce, maybe not to 5k or 6k yet but a real bounce. If you're talking about a bull market then yeah that's not gonna be for awhile, but like your username suggests...

If you mean that the sell signals on the 17th and 18th those are the top panels which are only useful on lower time frames. The 3rd and 4th panels are the ones to look out for for swing trading. Also the panel for the 17th that looks like it precedes the runup would have been released at the end of that trading day so the runup would have already happened by the time I released that panel, if someone were to take profits there after buying on the 14th or 15th they would have made around 10% profits.
