Many cops are corrupt themselves in other countries. It’s common to hear organized crimes and robberies to be done by cops, or allowed by cops who are paid by criminals

What makes you assume he didn’t just buy the car from his regular income?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:15:11
Incorrect. 
Anywhos... what does that have to do with anything?

People already do talk condescendingly about black youths.. so you’re point?
The main topic isn’t even about old white politicians - yet here you are.. triggered.
[Whataboutism]( is a helluva drug.

Imagine having friends.

She also brought age into it.. so why are you so sensitive/concerned about him saying white? 
It’s literally mostly old white men.. what’s the issue with saying it.

It’s not unnecessary, you’re just highly sensitive and shouldn’t be on the internet and with word white hurts you this much.

When did I ever indicate that my portfolio is 100% bitcoin?? Weird and wrong assumption, buddy.
Also, this is Reddit, an open forum online. There is no “intended audience”. When you posted this you knew that you would get responses from both those who do the same, and those who are strongly against spending bitcoin due to the inconvenience, high fees, and lost of potential profit during the next bullrun. I’m not the only one here telling you that they rather hold for a better outcome.. 
Either way.. if you end up like Greg.. don’t say people on here didn’t warn you lol:

No thanks. I’ll stick to holding my cryptos and just buying things with fiat. 
It’s not going to be worth knowing you spent the future value of 20k+ on whatever the hell you’re buying now instead of just using cash.

It comes with a recovery password. If you lose it, just get another nano and input your 24 character password.

I wonder why. So strange.. this post wasn’t even that bad with those who disagreed with them
@_date: 2018-07-07 20:10:56
Just like a stock, investing into properties, or holding gold... It’s an investment and there’s always a risk.
I rather lose 5k holding than lose 20k, 30k, or 50k+ by selling myself short on something I could have used cash on. 
Also.. if you’ve been following bitcoin for years, this correction is normal and needed. What’s the chance that bitcoin will drop to $0 and be valueless, especially considering how bull governments and regulations are finally for cryptocurrencies?? I’m no fool.. just hold and sell when your returns can change your life for the better.

What’s wrong with people caring about their personal wealth when it comes to investing? Why do you believe their worldview is twisted for holding their cryptos.. something they bought with their own money?
Genuine question for you.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:41:40
You should.. because you don’t want to be audited and get in trouble with the IRS (assuming you’re in the us)

How ignorant. Why assume he doesn’t know anything simply because he’s a “rapper”... yikes that really shows your character.
People who rap can’t be educated/informed on topics like cryptocurrency, investing, and finance?

Do we know when an announcement will be made on the decision? Or when exactly the ETF will happen?
