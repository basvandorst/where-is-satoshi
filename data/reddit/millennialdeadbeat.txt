True. But the way you said made it seem like you were happy to fail with a bitcoin but not a dollar. Just seemed kind of stupid. 
You didn't create bitcoin but you choose to deal with it.
You could also choose to move to Africa and deal with their currency or somewhere with a barter system. It's not something you created it's just a choice you made. 
But I get the essence of what you're saying. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:42:35
Exactly. Making it hard to just dump them back on the market.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:56:57


Yes. Your bitcoin is YOURS until the demand/price drops and they're not worth anything... Bitcoin has crashed before why do people act like it's impervious?
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:30:52
You don't understand his statement. Negative market investments and bad investment opportunities, is good for bitcoin which is an alternative investment vehicle.
They're absolutely related.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:13:09
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:37:19


Do you honestly think that monetary crashes and depressions aren't often by design?
Also not sure why the psychology makes a difference. Either way you end up destitute. Doesn't matter which system it's under if the result is the same. Starvation feels the same both ways.

Holy shit you're so naive it hurts.

[It has been CONFIRMED.](
Confirmed in a court of law. Deutsche Bank admitted to rigging the silver markets and then settled in court by ratting out the other banks who were also colluding with them to rig the silver market.
The fact that people don't understand the markets are rigged is fucking mind boggling. It baffles my mind that people choose to be so ignorant and naive in this age of information. Not to mention the fact that people don't understand money and the nature of power. You have to be corrupt to stay on top. That's why bitcoin is so important.

Just like there was a 0% chance Trump could get elected right?
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:18:57
Wrong. It comes down to control. They know exactly what they're doing.
Your level of thinking (no offense) is why the world is the way it is. Regular average people can't fathom the idea that their governments don't give a fuck about them and that the elites would intentionally screw people over. 
They think wars and depressions are "mistakes" or "just happen" when they're often by design. 
The reality is the average person is not so predatory and evil but many of the people at the top, and more importantly the systems that empower them, are inherently predatory and evil.

Well yeah. You hold the bitcoin and it's not a loss or a gain. Cuz you're holding it.

Nah he explained it properly haha thanks for the concern. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:05:12


That would be me.

This sounds really fucking stupid. Are you saying the best option is to make sure no one is happy?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:46:01
LOL. Can't wait to revisit this in August.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:00:07


Come on dude


Maybe. I'd be more safe by saying 1000 by this time next year.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:10:53
Likewise. This OP and thread are a joke to me.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:30:20


Not really. All they have to do is take away Bitcoin's market share and then they can gloat about it. Results are what matters and right now, especially with Aug 1st looming, a lot people think the "flippening" will take place.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:51:17




You like hyperbole though. If At&amp;T is on top does that mean Verizon is "dead"? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:27:57
Who brought up "bitcoin is dead" or bitcoin dying?
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:37:19
It's not an "either or" situation. There can be more than one cryptocurrency. Ethereum taking over market cap or trading volume doesn't mean Bitcoin has to completely disappear. 
I don't understand the hyperbole and contention of people who think supporting one coin means being against the other... 
You think I'm being disingenuous because of your own close mindedness. That's sad. You're being limited by yourself not anything I say.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:48:28
Imagine using Coinbase instead of Gemini... Why?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:07:55
Joke right?
