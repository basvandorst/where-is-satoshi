That's a billion usd stolen from mostly Russian banks and it was reported by a Russian security firm - one with a vested interest in selling more security software. People are already disputing the claim about the amount of money stolen.
The entire story is driven by scare tactics, same as with calls to regulate bitcoin. I'm not sure why you think it's ok to spread FUD like this story, but it's wrong to spread FUD about bitcoin.

Why would a three letter agency need to steal cryptocurrency? They don't seem to have any problem getting funding to do whatever they want with zero transparency. The "Black budget" of the US Defense Department was estimated to be $52.8 billion in 2012.

General financial news can be relevant to people interested in bitcoin, but this isn't a sub for general financial news.

How would that help?
The malware didn't exploit a security vulnerability in harddrive firmware, it used a documented feature to update the firmware code. It didn't exploit a backdoor, it planted a backdoor.
If anything, an open source HD firmware would make this even easier to do. The fundamental problem that allowed this attack is that the harddrive firmware could be updated without physically flipping a switch on it.

The commonly repeated myth is that 90% of restaurants fail in their first year. It's not true at all, but people keep repeating it. It's closer to 25%.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. Security is about risk management. The risk of being hacked never goes away no matter how much you spend on security.

Sorry, but there's no room for the benefit of the doubt when it comes to security and finances. You're just asking for trouble if you trust an exchange run by anonymous people in a country whose laws you don't understand.
So, you ask, how can I trade on an exchange if there isn't one in my country run by people who don't hide their identities? You fucking don't, unless you're prepared to lose money or you keep very little money on the exchange.

People will still make stupid mistakes and get busted. Technology doesn't change that.

There's always someone claiming an economic catastrophe is coming. If you keep repeating it over and over, you'll look like a genius when the economy goes through another boom/bust cycle.
