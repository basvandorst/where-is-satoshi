Chicago unions have a pretty strict rules on what has to be done by union members.  
For instance, many years ago, I worked a conference at McCormick Place and was scolded by my GM at the time as I was about to plug something in.  I had to call over a union electrician to take that cord and, with his extensive training and experience, correctly position those prongs over those three holes and insert one into the other.  It was dangerous, and in retrospect I am not sure I could have done it myself.  [/s]
That said, I really have to question why it would have cost $40-50,000 and why he couldn't have just coordinated with someone to bring a video camera.   
[Article from a few years ago about unions agreeing to lighten up after Chicago started losing trade-show business](
Also, given the size of the show (500 or so attendees), McCormick Place probably wasn't the best venue.  Since it seems many flew in, a spot in Rosemont near the airport may have been better (but farther away from the downtown attractions).  There's probably a downtown hotel he could have hosted it at also.

Sorry but I thought this was a retarded analogy. I get what the NYDFS is trying to do, even if they included the kitchen sink on their guidelines. But VirCurrs should operate on parity with existing regulation. The underlying regulations that they are trying to mimic like KYC need to be changed.

I own litecoin, it's about 10% of my virtual currency holdings.  You seem to have a BTC or Nothing attitude, which is retarded.  
If BTC fails or weakens for whatever reason, it is good that there are alternative infrastructures in place.  It is good to have competing currencies to make ensure the best technologies are being used.  It's good to have competing currencies to provide consumers alternative entrance and exit points.  
If that makes me some kind of shill in your mentally defective view of the world, then whatever as I don't particularly care.  History has shown time and again that people who put all their eggs in one basket end up being hurt in the long run.  Having a divested portfolio is one of the fundamental tenants of sound investing.
And yeah, I'd like to see Coinbase and Bitpay support litecoin.  But my goal in this post was to report on the conference itself and what I saw, not to be a shill for any particular technology.

Ok, well let's tell the whole tale here.  That's 1.51 trillion (estimated in 2012) over a 50+ year lifetime, and .5 trillion of that is on account of inflation over the next fifty years.  And that is for the entire program, which includes development, purchase, maintenance, etc.
And comparing that number with bitcoin is a ridiculous comparison.  Just because two numbers have $ signs in front of them, doesn't mean they are similar enough in what they represent to perform a comparison.  I really wish people on would learn this.
Also, you said the amount spent.  Past tense.  That amount hasn't been spent yet.  So yeah, bullshit.

It means that at first people thought internet-connected refrigerators were a dumb idea.  But in 2050 when RFIDs implanted into food packaging instantly determined expiration date and quantity of food (not just in the fridge but in your pantries as well), it could automatically compile a grocery list and even automatically order for pick-up at the local grocery store or delivery.  Not only that, it can provide updates to the status of the unit, and even highlight failing parts that can be easily repaired by the consumer with a replacement part.  And the average consumer will then be wondering how we ever lived with out it.
"Son, when I was your age we'd have to call in a repairman and it'd cost hundreds of dollars in labor to fix a fridge, and usually took a few trips to get it right.  Now look at how cool this is, it's telling me the compressor is going bad.  So right here on the fridge screen I say to go ahead and order one, and it will be here in a few days.  And this saturday, I'll show you how to pull out the old compressor and put in the new one. It'll take about 10 minutes."

Probably should have googled more first...
    If you pay independent contractors, you may have to file Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, to report payments for 
    services performed for your trade or business. If the following four conditions are met, you must generally report a payment as 
    nonemployee compensation.
    You made the payment to someone who is not your employee;
    You made the payment for services in the course of your trade or business (including government agencies and nonprofit organizations);
    You made the payment to an individual, partnership, estate, or in some cases, a corporation; and
    You made payments to the payee of at least $600 during the year.
So if payments go over $600 there may be a reporting requirement.

If 5% of funds thought to be lost are suddenly dumped in the market, it would crash the market.  I might be more afraid of heirs gaining access to the keys and dumping them, but I suppose he would put them in some type of trust to be released little by little over time.  
But still, shit happens.  Imagine that "Oh-Fuck" moment in 2010 if your hard drive crashes and you lost everything.  Back then it's $50,000.  Enough to be seriously pissed.  And would you say anything? Or just be like "Well fuck this shit, I'm out of here."

And how do they expect these systems to generate enough funds from mining to make it worth while.  I bought a cheapy ASIC miner last summer that I could put into my desktop and have it run.  I think in 7 months it generated 7 to 10 cents in bitcoin.  I knew at the start it was a losing proposition, but did it just to fuck around.  
I don't quite see how any device could generate any kind of substantial revenue from mining (which is really just being paid for by the user in increased electricity costs and the cost of the embedded chip) to even pay for its initial cost much less be high enough to pay towards some new feature.  Which itself would probably just be a feature alreaedy available on the device and locked out to the end-user till they pay for it.

But it will never be a major currency in the global financial markets.  There will never be this "shadow economy" where bitcoin is widely traded and used.  It's just not going to happen.  
As he said, "It's kind of cute now."  It is just a toy.  That is why it is not "real".  It's no more a real currency than your neighbor's home-built gocart is a real automobile.  It is a little side curiosity that popped up in the past few years, and a few people in the financial industry and governments have taken notice of.  
And, according to him, it never will be one.  If it ever actually started to grow and become some significant "shadow economy", then governments will start creating and enforcing laws, regulations, and even outright banning it.  It won't go away, but nobody (i.e. people who want to stay within the law) will touch it.  That means banks, currency exchanges, websites, stores, etc.  Not one legal business will actively and openly trade in it.
And now let's put what he said in frame of reference for the banking industry.  Why should they even bother to fuck around with it, when there is a strong case that if it ever became a substantial currency that it would be banned?  Bitcoin isn't a threat to them.  No government will allow a non-controlled currency, and the banking industry just won't be involved in something that is outright illegal (save your snide response to that, I already know it).
So to him and the leaders of the financial industry, it's just a non-starter.  It'll still be around as a curiosity and people will fuck with it.  But as a non-controlled currency that has a substantial place in the world financial markets?  "It's just not going to happen," according to him and he explained why.

I was assuming you're talking about his assertion, aware of the context of which it was said.  You are not. You seem to think "real" was used in the sense that it satisfies all the elements to be called such.  That's not how he is using the word "real".   He's using it in the sense of it it being commonly used and widely accepted. 
It's like if someone said, "Curling isn't a real sport."  While curling is technically a real sport .... it's not a real sport.  If someone ever asked me "What is your opinion on curling as the next big major league sport?"  I would say "It's boring and most people don't understand it.  No, curling is not a real sport, and you're fooling yourself if you think it ever will be."  While it is true curling is an actual sport ... no, it will never be a real sport.

First thing, "should" and "can be" are two different things.  The speed limit "should be 45" doesn't mean I can drive 50 when it's posted as 35.  If his shtick is that he is peacefully protesting by breaking the law, then he should go to court and plead his case instead of hiding out fighting extradition.  
But more importantly, most of the content wasn't old material that should have been past copyright expiration.  Let's not be disingenuous about what was really going on,  bit for bit, the majority of content on MegaUpload that was being send back-and-forth was current copyrighted material.  I hardly believe people were downloading Steamboat Willy.  It was mostly all current films, music, and software.

He facilitated the illegal distribution of IP with a value far greater than that.  
Not everyone who produces IP are rich fat-cats who sit on piles of money. There's real people with jobs like sound engineers, costume designers, background extras, editors, software developers, graphic artists, set designers, musicians, so on and so forth.  All of them are harmed when somebody uses a piece of IP without paying for it, and this douche bag knew EXACTLY what his service was being used for and even facilitated it through many of his actions.

Even still, it's not THAT difficult.  I bought a USB miner for shits and giggles and it took a few hours to figure out what software to install, join a mining cabal, and start chugging away.  Yes, I know I am consuming more power than I'm getting back, but that's not the point.
If you know the basics of how bitcoin and mining works and once you've gotten one mining rig to run then adding on more (to a point) is a matter of financing and effort.  That is until your residential power supply can no longer cut it and you start scaling into data-centers and setting up constant monitoring.
You should show them the spreadsheet and tell them you run through those calculations by hand, and there's tens of thousands of people around the world, mostly in Asia, who are doing that.  And when they say "That should be automated", then respond to them ... "Oh my god I never thought of that.  I could probably make a lot more doing it that way!"

That's for the courts to decide.  And yes, if he was doing business in the U.S. (where his servers were hosted, and where he was sending checks to in compensation for heavy uploaders of pirated materials), then he can be charged in the U.S. for the crimes he is accused of.  
The reason fatboy is fighting extradition so hard is because once he  steps foot on U.S. soil he will be arrested and very likely be found guilty of some or all of the criminal complaints.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:40:08
I don't like him because he has been involved in illegal and shady activities for all of his life.  And he will say anything he has to in order to make himself look like the innocent cherub who is persecuted by the evil system.  That is why he is annoying and contemptible.  
The thing about MegaUpload is that it was clearly used as a distribution channel for IP protected content.  And him and his buddies clearly knew that (read the email exchanges in the original indictment).  He was also doing this on a very grand scale, it was by no means a small warez bbs. 
I get why he is going to fight the case tooth and nail, but I also believe he was pretty much guilty and should be held to the crimes.  These weren't victim-less crimes.  People work hard to produce this content to be paid, which he was facilitating other people using the content without paying the owners of the content their due.   And the arguments that he's used to defend himself are laughable.  He blames the IP rights holders because (for instance) some kid in Germany didn't have access to a film (this is an actual statement from an interview).  The problem is, he doesn't own the rights and he doesn't have the right to distribute.  And he consistently turned away (and even encouraged through his payment/fees) piracy that he made millions of dollars off of.  
He wants to pretend he is this great advocate of freedom, but please don't be fooled.  He's only advocating whatever he needs to so he doesn't go to jail.  He has a long shady history of being a douchebag, the details of which are readily available all over the Internet.

You have a simple mind that thinks in simple black and white terms.  
I find your reasoning to be true of the founds of Google, and every other CEO in your holier-than-thou industry.  Most of their revenue and wealth today is not generated by their own work, but the work of the people who work for them.  Their search engine isn't the true revenue driver, it is their advertising, and soon  to be the people who came to them and said "we will develop google car" and "we will develop google glass".  And they said "We will give you money to do that for us, because it will make us wealthier".
And when somebody says "I have built you google reader, and people like it", they will look deep into their books and see it is not making them wealtheir.  And then they shall reply "let there be darkness for there is no profit" and turn it off.  
They are all just as "parasitic", but you can't see it.

Yes.  I gambled some, bitcoin tipped, and bought someone gold.  I didn't buy anything because there was nothing in the past month that I wanted to buy where I could buy that would accept bitcoin (e.g. groceries, mortgage, utilities).  I even tried to buy the alpaca socks but they are sold out.  I looked at SilkRoad but didn't want to risk, you know, going to prison.  And I might have bought something from CoinStore (I could use a new HDD) but not the fuck right now.

@_date: 2013-05-21 05:21:35
HAHAHAHA YOU CAN'T EVEN GIVE THIS SHIT AWAY.  
I was bored tonight and posting questions on Omegle.  I figured maybe if one person knew what bitcoin was  they could help the other.  I thought if I managed to give some away, I'd post the whole convo to for shits and giggles.  
So I started the offer with 100 mBTC.  And I gradually moved it up.  And yes, I was dead serious.  I kept upping the offer hoping to at least find someone willing to bite.  
Oh well.  
(I didn't keep the 5 BTC offer for long.  But I did have the 1 BTC going for a few minutes and about 75-100 disconnects.  A lot of "What?".  And a few ascii penises.).  
Shit dumb fucks didn't even stop to discuss it even when I posted the USD value of the coins I was offering to send.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:01:11
Bitcoin should be dead, and I bet it will be soon enough.  Why?  Because it is too easy to manipulate.  Nobody in their right mind will ever want to use any sort of unregulated virtual currency as a storehouse of value for anything but a few moments.  
And if that is the case, that bitcoin will inherently always be too volatile and insecure, then there is very little reason to ever use it except for the one benefit it has - to be possibly anonymous.  So that means it is nothing more than a currency for people who may want to be anonymous either for legal reasons (e.g. buying porn on line) or illegal (buying drugs).  And if that is the case, absolutely no reputable company will ever get involved with it.   And because of that, we'll always be dealing with the likes of companies like MtGox or BTC-E. 
Virtual currencies are a fucking joke.  It just isn't going to happen, I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

No shit sherlock.  


And yet, we discover how to break/solve/prove/discount/confirm shit that previous individuals, even generations upon generations or people, have been trying to before us.  
Just because nobody has done it yet, doesn't mean at any time somebody can figure out how to do it.  Which was my point.  Not to long ago, I remember hearing security researchers discounting the idea of a hacker being a able to physically destroy a piece of infrastructure because it had yet to ever be done.  And then there was Stuxnet.

You say this as if you think what you are saying is a strong and well thought out counter-point to discredit the one I made.  There's at least three different, and very important, flaws to your comparison.  I'll leave you to figure out what they are and then provide me your responses to them if you can justify why they aren't valid.

If you are writing a completely new trade engine in 2-3 weeks, then you are very probably doing something wrong.  Seriously, that gives me the god-damn heebie jeebies.  I mean, you do realize you're handling other people's money, don't you?
Are you not going to QA it?  Skip any sort of error handling routines? Maybe you'll throw nine women on the project, get that baby done in a month?

I think if that happens, it would only be a few months till Israel completely breaks the encryption or finds massive faults in the currency that makes it subsequently unusable.

"Bitcoins" are a joke.  In two weeks, there will be another virtual currency that will be all the rage, and "bitcoins" will go back down to 0.  Bitcoins might regain steam in four more years when a new batch of fools come along.

Hell, I'm not even worried about that.  I'm worried about people who manipulate it for their own gain and at the expense of people who just want to use it as a store of value.  
I know a lot of people are shitting on the speculators trying to make a buck.  But the bubble presents a very real problem that should drive anyone away from using it as a currency.  And as much as people want it to be used as a currency, and only a currency, that's just wishful thinking when real money is on the table.  Manipulators will pump and dump it until they've bled all the suckers dry, and only the fools put any money into the system.  
It's the ultimate in penny stock because, being able to be made anonymous, there's very little way to get caught and, because it's unregulated, no policing authority is going to give a shit.

You do realize that one entity holding 1% of the currency is very very very bad for your currency, don't you?  
The value of whatever you decide to have involved in your currency will be at the whim of somebody else.  If they decide to dump, your currency will become worthless.  You know you assholes are always going on about "It is a currency it is not an investment"?  Right?  Well, if it is a currency then the absolute last thing  that you want is for it to be so easily manipulated by anyone.  Especially for a few measly million dollars or so.  That is EXACTLY what is happening here.  
For all the libertarian tards who are so worried about the value of the US Dollar dropping, owning a virtual currency that can be effectively decimated overnight by a handful of people is god damn retarded.
At least if I were bought into a corporation with a stock or bond, I know who the people are who can play with the value of my security.  In this case we're allowing anonymous millionaire assholes to manipulate at will for their own benefit.  
But yeah, I'm the fucktard.  Maybe you should go back to high school tomorrow and find a social studies teacher who can teach you basic macro economics and monetary theory.

Well first thing, $1.6M isn't a lot.  In fact, it's chump change to many many people.  So you're opening yourself up, to any fool who puts money into it, to losing.  And if that's the case, they're better of going to a casino and using casino chips as a store of value.  If they want to gamble, they can put it on a roulette wheel.  
Second, I am glad you agree that your fantasy has serious flaws that make it laughable to be called a currency.   As stated above, a casino's chips are a better store of value.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:19:33
This is a terrible idea right now until the volatility settles.  If I buy $100 in bitcoins it may be worth $5 by the time drive the fifteen minutes to get home.
