That's the "beauty" of it. Every day, new people come of age to be able to get new cards.
Plus, if 30-100 people spend to your limit one time and pay it off, they've given the card company enough money to lose everything you owe, without you paying back a single dime.
I would love to know how much of this credit card debt is just interest, and doesn't represent actual money given to merchants for products.

The biggest red flag for a bank when you transfer money is trying to avoid regulatory limits.
If they are required to report transactions over $10,000 and you deposit $9900 at a time, then you'll be flagged as a possible money launderer, and your accounts might be frozen.
It is better to take as few transactions as possible, and just let them report the money. You don't have anything to hide anyway.

Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the Bitcoin Block chain.
Both versions of Bitcoin are being mined now, and both are valid.
It also means that if you access your BTC wallet address from a BCH wallet, you will have the same amount of BCH as you had BTC at the time of the fork.
Coinbase is being nice by giving you access to the BCH that you "owned" at the time of the split, instead of ignoring it.

When you make an investment in anything, you generally increase your money on it. When you do, that money is income, similar to if you worked for it, but taxed slightly different.
Let's assume you deposit $1000 and take out $2000, and work a shit job.
That $1000 profit is taxed at 0%, because you're low income. If you make like $100,000 then you would have to pay 15% on it.
*However*, if that withdrawal occurs in the same year, then it is taxed as regular income, not Capital Gains.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:50:36
Sadly, the transfer fees *are* that much. But they are not fees assessed by Via or any other wallet. They are the fees required to get your transaction accepted by the miners.

How about running it manually, take waves of blind bids without updating, then every 15 minutes to an hour update the bid with the current high bidder. Only the last round, where a winner is decided, would need to wait for a full confirmation.
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:35:24
Exactly. But one way that the site owners have an advantage is that they can grant themselves free bids, and basically never lose an auction they don't want to lose. (They would want some legitimate winners out there to give testimonials)

You can't just say "don't use a blockchain" without an alternative. If every node is expected to have a full record of the transactions, how would it be propagated to a new node?
What would be the structure of this ledger, and how would it be more efficient than the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:34:25
regarding the value of the coins after they are all mined...
As the block reward lessens, the cost of mining coins goes up compared to the reward. This necessitates an increase in the price, caused by miners selling coins to redeem the value (either for fiat currency or by spending the coins). When there is no block reward, miner earnings will be only the collected transaction fees, which creates a type of inflation in value as users try for cheaper transactions and the value increases.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:30:38
Open Source data won't find bots running on the system.
The "scam" is in the fact that when you sell a product for $1, the people are actually spending a total of $26-100, depending on the cost of bids.

The blockchain is a system that tells who has which bitcoins, and makes sure that everyone's balances are correct.
Miners collect new transactions and use their computers to sign new blocks onto the chain, and other miners check the work to make sure it's right.

@_date: 2015-12-31 16:05:02
I don't know if tying a penny auction site to a system that takes 10-60 minutes to confirm is viable.
But that could be used easily for a standard auction system.
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:32:24
They would still be able to make and use them.
For example, if I was one of those people, I would create my website and give the buyers the ability to see what city other buyers are from (easily done by analyzing the first two digits of the IP address without having a privacy issue) to show how open and honest I am.
I then make a standard account for myself that is accessed by a bot on a second computer, running a VPN. Everyone can see that I am in Corpus Christi, but it wouldn't be easy to tell when my bot, "in" New York, wins an auction that would have resulted in a loss.
And, of course, I'd only need to cheat like that when I'm dealing with an unacceptable loss, like if I put out an auction for a $1000 TV, and it only reached $10 ($260 including 25 cent bids), then I could use my dummy account to force the auction higher, or win it back for myself...
And because a TV is not unique in any way, you (the rube trying to win) can't know that I'm cheating you.
*But*, if the auction goes high enough that I make profit, or is close enough that the loss is acceptable, then I can just leave the auction alone and send out the product as offered.

Well, now you're trying to get around filters, so they'll ban you.
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:59:18
What is a qualifying node in that regard? And where would the balance data be held?
Under the current system, that role is held by the blockchain, a linear ledger that each node saves and each miner has access to. Without that chain, we would need a centralized server.
What would be done, basically, is to have a server containing all the balance data and 3 nodes would be required to perform a transaction. The buyer, the seller, and an escrow.
The buyer node sends the money, the seller node accepts the money, the escrow node runs an automated check to make sure there are no shenanigans. Any node connected to the system can be the escrow node, with a preference for the furthest distance from the buyer and seller.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:26:43

Well, how much can a single Pi achieve, and how much extra will you spend on electricity?
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:00:42
That depends on what your costs are and how you pay for them.
If you are holding your bitcoin, and not selling it to pay for electrical costs, then it might still be better to mine, earn the rewards while they are still low value, buy more with fiat at the same time, and wait for the price to rise again.
If too many people stop mining, it messes with the strength of the system and encourages inconsistent mining.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:17:10
Right. If you are having to sell Bitcoin to pay for your costs, you want to stop mining for now. Otherwise, keep going and it will eventually go up again.

The same length of time as any other kind of 128 or 256 binary number.
As for how large a sphere would need to be to realistically contain the computing power to brute force a 256 bit number within a lifetime?
Multiplying the number of computers per square meter with the surface area of the Neptunian Dyson Sphere give us 3.61e40 computers. Let us assume that including breathing space for the systems that 2 can fit in a square meter, giving us 1.87e40 sq meters of surface area required. That would be a Dyson Sphere roughly 3.8e19 meters in radius, or 254 million AU... 4000 light years.

I will concede that it will be harder, but not impossible, to load BTC, but not for the reason you give. The true reason is the fact that the alternative (borrowing in USD) is far more useful than borrowing BTC.
There will be people willing to borrow BTC, however, as long as the percentage rate is low enough. 
In fact, current banking systems could use BTC as a method of transmitting loaned money to recipients at the full percentage rate, and request the return in USD via check. In this situation, BTC deposits would be recorded as USD transactions, when in reality they are holding the BTC for future loan transactions.

Personally? I don't have a huge stake in bitcoin, partially because people keep borrowing money from me... it is so hard to save.
I have about 87 GHS on Ghash.io, so the dropping BTC value is a wash. It costs more to get new GHS, but the existing GHS is worth more.
If the price goes up, then I can get more hashing power cheaper, so it is still a win.

It isn't that hard to figure out.
They sell gift cards, they have products. People redeem gift cards for products.
As long as **1.** not everyone redeems their cards at once, and **2.** other non-gift-card purchases are made, the company will be more than solvent.
When you factor in the fact that most people spend more than their gift card amount, and many people leave balances unused on cards, that $7.5B worth of inventory goes a *long* way.

The difference being that if it were a bank, I would be taking your money and loaning to someone else that you will never know for some purpose you never know. Outside of not loaning the money in the first place, I could do nothing to prevent a default, even from a person with good credit.
With a gift card, the money stays in the company. If I fail to deliver the gift card value, then it is my fault and no one else's.
The smaller the company that offers a gift card, the more of that amount will be used or held for day-to-day operations. The larger the company, the less likely a "run" of gift card use will pose a problem.
To use my own business as an example, I run a card shop online. I would need $560 a week to run it full time, without having to be at the job I am at now. I do offer gift cards, though I am not particularly big yet, so no one has bought one.
Suppose people begin buying them in large amounts, because I hawk them heavily to raise money. I pull in $1120 worth of cards, huge for a small business and what amounts to an amazing week. It would cover everything for 2 weeks.
I have a large amount of product now, mostly cards, but I would want to make sure my bases are covered, so I earmark the first $40 for the website, the next $560 for buying extra toys and accessories to ensure my selection is wide, and the rest is my "paycheck" for the 2 weeks. This, by the way, is about what I would make where I work for the same period.
Notice what I did there. By buying more product first, I make sure that I can honor all $1000 worth of gift cards right away. If I was running low on cards, which is my primary product, I would buy them instead.
So, things progress on this hypothetical. I've grown to the point where I have $15,000 in reserve (26 weeks at $560 a week), and I get another $1000 in gift card sales. That whole amount can go into an expansion fund to get closer to hiring a second person.
Now, let's add in the caveat that out of all of these gift cards, $1120 a week for half a year, $30,000 worth of gift cards, not a single one was redeemed.
I would have the products I started with, plus $7280 (wholesale) in additional product (itself worth between $9500 and $15,000 depending on the actual product), without even touching my reserves.
While I could easily burn through some reserve to make quick purchases if everyone spent their gift cards at once, you would be surprised at how little I would need to do that for.
So, we get to a different level, years from now. I am now a card game empire with franchises all over the country. Our reserve budget is in the millions to begin with, as is the value of our inventory. It just needs to be raised or lowered depending on exactly how much we have outstanding in gift cards, as it would be increasingly impossible for everyone to spend them at the same time.
I digress a little, but my point is that gift cards can be considered loans, just as bank deposits can, but they are treated and used much differently.

Nothing legally prevents me from paying my rent in frozen chicken patties, if that's what my landlord wants.
The only way bitcoin can not legally be used as a tool for bartering (that is, a currency) is if it is illegal in general.
now, it is "not legal tender", meaning the government does not recognize it for public debts, but that is not the same thing as "illegal tender"

That isn't true, though.

Retail companies typically have a fairly large amount of inventory warehoused, upward of 6 months worth. The same with operating expenses, such as building rent, electricity, and employee pay. In the odd situation where a company has an outstanding gift card balance that threatens their operating budget, they would limit the sale of new cards, encourage the overuse of existing cards (items that when including tax are over the typical gift card amount) and hold more cash/inventory in reserve.
With a bank, the only things they can do is get new deposits and stop loaning out.
Yes, in a large business, gift card revenue goes into profits, which go to shareholders and investment. But first, above all else, it goes to the same place any other revenue goes, the direct running of the business itself.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:00:17
Yes. That is the way you get a $10B estimate. 
I said it was a lazy estimate. 
On one hand it is ignoring a key part of a currency's value, the amount of goods and services rendered in the currency. On the other hand, it uses the hypothetical upper end of the available coinage instead of the current number of coins in circulation.  
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:38:21
The major difference being that gift cards are not redeemable for cash. They are coupons to be redeemed for goods and services at a later time.
As such, they actually are paid back at a lower value. That is, if I sell you a gift card at $20, the products you buy with that card only cost me $15. The same $5 profit is made, but recorded earlier, with the money going into the business as normal.
If a large number of gift cards are redeemed at once, my company would not suffer, provided I did not misuse the funds from the gift cards in the first place, and every card would be able to be redeemed. 
Even if I sold millions in gift cards, I'd have used huge portions of that for buying product.
With the bank, however, they are being given the "loan" by you (bank deposit) and then loaning it out to other people who may or may not pay it back.
Ultimately, it boils down to how many people you have to trust. A store selling a gift card is not contingent on someone else to repay the gift card, it is all on them.

This may be true, but how did you get that $100 worth of bitcoin?

He is saying that as a population grows and expands, a government and a currency system is required to sustain it.
Without a centralized government, how will we determine who is in the wrong regarding disputes? The more individual voices in the crowd, the more likely someone will be against any particular view. 
Take, for example, the intelligent design/evolution debate. Some believe one way, some believe another. A close knit community of religious people would prefer to teach their children that evolution doesn't occur, but we, the scientific minded, would want to have them teach proper science. Who gets to decide which is right? 
Now in this example, there is a right answer, scientifically speaking, but there are still those who refuse to believe it.
In an Anarchy, the only thing stopping you from doing something against society is the threat of an angry mob. If you are good enough at killing people, for example, you can make people afraid to fight back, giving you free rein. 
As the population grows larger, a police force is required to protect the innocent. Such a force can be created without a government, like lawmen in the Old West, but it will still be quickly turned into a type of government. The Sheriff's office gets overwhelmed by civil requests, and splits off to have a mayor. The mayor deals with too many requests and forms a city council,  and so on and so forth.
Try to make an anarchic city of more than 1000 people, and they will either die or move out completely,  or else they will form a government before they reach 2000 people.

Technically, yes.
But there is more too it than that.
In the case of a mythical Double-Spend, you could end up seeing a transaction that posted fail to confirm. The more confirmations you wait for, the less likely this will occur.
With credit cards, the card companies generally post a 3 month limit for chargebacks (give or take). But most transactions are never questioned.
Thus, for most companies it would operate business as usual.

A gift card is much different, even if you subscribe to this belief.
With the banks, you give them money with the promise that you can get it back whenever you need it. The money is loaned out to others at interest, with a portion of that interest earmarked to you, who provided the capital. 
With a gift card, you are simply prebuying an unknown item or items from the store. This money is not a loan, like money you store in a bank. Gift cards are only a fraud if they are not honored.

Insider trading *is* a type of fraud.
When you act on information that the general public does not have, knowing that you have information they do not have, you create a power imbalance in which you can cause worse negative impact than otherwise would occur.
For example, if I knew that Square Enix was closing up shop on Wednesday, I could sell my shares before they crash. But, if I knew because my wife is on the board and she *tells me* they are closing, then I am unloading what I know to be worthless stock to someone who thinks that it is valuable. It would be the same as selling pyrite as gold.

It's a subjective thing. You are allowed to do either,  and be understood.

Actually, they can make one BTC into 10 via accounting magic. Specifically, they take BTC deposits,  for this example totaling 1 BTC, and they lend out that 1 BTC at 1% interest. They also act as a method of trading BTC for USD, allowing depositors to spend the BTC without it leaving the bank. 
The lent BTC then earns interest for the time it is out of their hands, but the bank's accounting can show 2 BTC, one in expected earning and one in held deposits.

Funny, but what he means is that you don't have to put in a full declaration of where you got the money if you're only depositing an extra $20 a day.
Banks are going to verify identity no matter what, but you get federal reporting laws after a certain level of transfers.

If PayPal were to have direct bitcoin payments, as opposed to this Braintree usage, they would have you send bitcoin to them, where it would be held until I, the seller, request it into my wallet. In that manner, they can freeze my PayPal account, and any unclaimed funds can be lost.

Yes. I have always maintained that banks should generally be open outside of normal business hours so business owners can stop in after they close. Not too late, obviously, but something along the lines of 6-7 PM. 
Take this small branch for example, workers have to commute for 2-3 hours just to open the bank for 1 hour once a week. It's a huge waste of resources. Hell, they probably spend more on the cost of the building than from the fees they get from the customers there.
Maybe they think the village will grow, maybe they do it for the public relations, maybe these villagers are insanely rich and the bank males more than I am estimating.

One thing.
Legal Tender does not mean that every private company must accept it. It simply means that the government *recognizes* it.
For example, if I want to trade my phone for your playing cards, I am allowed to. Or, I can give you this magic paper money that some old guy printed. (Money)
If I give you bitcoin, telling you that if you just hold onto it, it'll be worth millions, then the government can rule in a lawsuit that I gave an unreasonable expectation for the value of my side of the trade, and have that trade negated. (A rare situation, used generally only if I act fraudulently). Even in many cases like this, let the buyer beware.
But with Legal Tender, you do not have that kind of recourse. I asked for a price, and gave you what you wanted.
If I *really* want to be paid in rubber bands (because I'm building a record breaking rubber band ball) for my goods, then I'm allowed to do that.
However, for *public debts*, like taxes, I can only use legal tender. The IRS won't take payment in Bitcoin, Liberty Dollars, or Disney Dollars.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:41:45

That means they hold approximately $7.5B in physical inventory at any given time. The $30B in liabilities is not solely gift card  values, and gift cards can be used for non physical purchases, such as digital downloads of movies and games. Products can also be preordered and backordered, if they do not have inventory on hand.
Their worst case scenario would be *every single person in the world refusing to pay them a dime*, and *every single card holder finding products that spent their balance to the penny, all on the same day*.
You can see how that is simply never going to happen.

It means that you have to be creative in your contracts, and clear in the value of the bit.
If you describe your bits as "going to be worth millions" before buying a computer for 0.000035 BTC, then you can be seen as scamming people. If you properly show that they are worth $375 a coin, and you buy the same computer for 2 BTC, then you are not.

But, I like how you list only negatives for PayPal, ignoring the fact that PayPal can be easily converted into cash money (withdrawal from ATM using PayPal debit card or your own bank account), but bitcoin can not as easily. Coinbase is the easiest, it seems for that, but would require waiting for transfer.
The irreversible transaction issue is frankly a wash, great for me as a seller (as I am protected from fraudulent chargebacks) but horrible as a buyer (because you could just not send product).
 Having a POS with bitcoin integration would be optimal, as the seller would have the product in hand most times and the buyer can not charge back.

What does traveling have to do with opening a bank account?
If I were to travel to New York, right now, I would simply need to call my bank and tell them I am traveling to avoid any fraud hold issues. And even if my account is flagged for potential fraud, it would be released easily with one phone call. (I used to work for American Express, I know how this works).
For a business account, you just need to have the identifying information for the company, plus a good personal history with the bank (you don't have negative balance accounts).
Wikileaks, is breaking the law with those leaks, even if we agree that it is necessary.
Erotica is a better example of a legal service that may be blocked, I'll grant, but most banks won't worry about that, just the payment processors. So, if you wish to sell erotica, you should search for a processor that specializes in it.
There is a reason for that, of course. Many porn websites, knowingly or unknowingly, end up associated with child porn.
I, with my retail website, could get away with explicit items without question, as it isn't my focus. If I were to switch to a full-on porn site, they would worry that I would dip into illegal activity. 
It doesn't help that even legitimate  porn sites act in an unscrupulous manner.

Hoarding bitcoin is part of what creates the bubbles due to rarity and stagnation. What happens is the people who are trading bitcoin, either in exchanges or for product, see less coin circulating and can not tell the difference between lost coins and hoarded coins.
When the hoarders finally decide to break their account open, either to trade or spend, they will find a weaker economy to use the coin in, and the prices for each coin would drop sharply.
The accumulation of wealth is a good thing, but only if it is caused by people *buying and selling* with it.
Look at the superrich from the fiat world. Buffett, Winklevoss, Gates, Winfrey... The spend massive amounts of money every year, some years more than others. The fortunes, whether you like the fact they have them, are liquid with new money mixing with old. The same thing can happen with Bitcoin Millionaires. If everyone with more than 10 BTC hoarded and didn't spend, then the liquidity of Bitcoin as a whole goes down.

Is it normal to earn so little from Cloud Mining that fees bring and keep you in the negative? With 13.5 Ghash, I'm getting 1500-2000 shares every 10 minutes, but the group is only finding blocks about once an hour.
Is there a way of breaking down what we are paying for with that 32 satoshi per 512 shares?

There are legitimate reasons for confiscating money from criminals.
The question is "where should that money go"?
If you make your money as a killer for hire, do you honestly think you should keep it? The same rules apply to people who break other laws for money, like gambling and drug dealing, even if you disagree with those laws.
Under the current system, police have an incentive to pull over motorists and confiscate the money because they are legally allowed to keep it. By making the money have to go to specific groups designated by the type of crime, drug rehab for drug offenses, victim's services for rape or murder, etc., you remove an incentive.

That is simply not true.
The card processor, assuming he is engaging in normal practices, will get an authorization code from the credit card company immediately (the equivalent of the first confirmation).
If he falls to follow those practices, by simply collecting your card number and running it at night without a signature, then he is opening himself up for fraud, and can even have his processing account taken away.

Honestly, if they think that their shenanigans would be damaging, but not destructive to bitcoin, they would simply hold one to them and use them as normal.
If they think that they would ruin bitcoin, they would want and need to attempt to cash out as quickly as possible. That means buying merchandise, gift cards, or other methods to switch to cashable fiat, even if they take a loss. 
But take, for example, this scenario. They had a large amount of fiat in their accounts, which (assuming the whole thing was a scam from the beginning) they had previously siphoned $1,000,000 to other personal accounts. They use that money to open a warehouse, buying and filling it with sellable material using bitcoin, especially while the price is higher, which goes onto the internet via ebay or other services to sell. (Legally, this would fall under theft and money laundering)
Or, for a scenario based on them wanting more BTC, they again siphon off the fiat money before closing trading, moving it to other exchanges. They wait for the price of BTC to fall due to their own announcement, and  buy more bitcoin at a lower price, then wait for the price to rise again after the news ages. (This would be theft, money laundering, and market manipulation)
If they were to try and cash out, they wouldn't simply use *one* avenue to get out. They would use *every* avenue that they could.

If I were doing this for Quickbooks, I would take the bitcoin payments, then put the bitcoin onto an exchange to get the cash back. This action would keep bitcoin in the hands of people who want to use it, keeps the flow of bitcoin steady, gets Intuit a chance to profit, and gets merchants an extra avenue for earnings. 
And because Intuit is not the only one performing this action, Gyft and BitPay being other notable providers, it is not centralized.

Structuring is a crime if you are trying to avoid IRS reporting.
If you are depositing $6,000 a day *because you earn $6,000 a day*, then you are not structuring, you are making your legitimate deposits.
Thus, the forfeiture *should* be required to be tied to a criminal conviction.
Edit: It should be noted that in the case I was referring, the man may or may not have been guilty, and the money (a little over $5000) was seized because it was in his house as cash. The prosecutor was trying the money in a civil trial before the criminal trial, with a lower burden of proof, so they could keep the money even if he was innocent.

The point of Bitcoin was to be able to transfer money from one person to another quickly, easily, and cheaply, with proof of the transaction.

A regulated exchange means that there are rules and oversight to ensure that stockholders and investors don't lose their money due to fraudulent activity. They have insurance, and regulations that say to kill the exchange for the day in the event of a crash, mitigating fear-based selling.
That makes the value a little less volatile, which in turn increases confidence.
Because bitcoin is starting in such a volatile position, this move is a *huge* one for consumer confidence, and can cause an increased interest in the use of bitcoin, which further strengthens the value.
The third aspect, which we will need, is an incentive to hold bitcoin, as well as sell it, so businesses, like mine, don't have to immediately sell our BTC in order to buy new products or pay rent. The easiest way for that to happen is for suppliers, distributors, real estate offices, etc., to accept bitcoin for payment.

Okay, there is only a few ways of handling the new currency.
1. distribution in exchange for an action (mining or staking). Mining has the benefit of actually processing the transactions in a decentralized manner, removing the need for a central bank.
2. distribution in exchange for fiat money. This means that a central network has to create the digital currency and sell them to others. The "problem" that some see with this is the fact that rich people are the ones to get the new currency.
3. distribution for free. This is what many people would want, because it means money for free, but it is easily abused (due to the anonymity of bitcoin) and will make the coin worth very little.

More importantly, the blockchain doesn't record purchases of bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency. And many wallets are basically anonymous.
Even if you counted bitcoin as a stock, the transaction tax would be based on the price of that transaction. So, trading 1 bitcoin means a fee almost definitely less that $1, and probably close to $0.01.
The other wrench in this is the fact that bitcoin is not a registered, publically traded company, so they would have little way of enforcing such a tax.

Short answer? They couldn't possibly have done all that without leaving other traces, like unknown activity on your gmail or something.

Seeing as most people are trading smaller amounts, it is a good thing that they use percentage-only fees, though the introduction of a regressive transaction fee would cause people to trade the coin on the exchange less (and use the coins for purchases more)

Think of a credit card. 15 or 16 digits, seemingly random numbers.
In reality, there is an algorithm that determines your card number.
The card number includes the issuing bank info, the customer account number, a card id number, and a checksum digit. They plug in the account numbers into a form and the checksum digit is selected based on those numbers.
To find a missing number on your credit card number, write each digit in order, leaving an X where you are missing it. 
Every other digit is multiplied by 2, with two digit numbers added together. In this manner, 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 5 becomes 1 (10, 1+0).
Add those numbers together (without the missing number) to find a total. Take the ones digit of that total and subtract it from 10. If the X is in a single position, that is your missing number. If it is doubled and even, you must divide by two. If it is doubled and odd, you add 9 and divide by 2.
To illustrate, you have the card number 4567-8901-2345-X678.
Doubling every other digit gets you 8537-7901-4385-X658.
Adding those together gets you 89. 90-89 is 1. X is in a doubling position, so 1 becomes 5.
Your completed card number is 4567-8901-2345-5678
If you *don't* know what number is missing, then the X can be in any position, and changing that will create a different number for each of the 16 potential numbers. But only 1 for each position.
Important note: that formula is only valid for numbers that use the same system.
UPC codes use a similar one, where each digit is multiplied by a different number to get the checksum digit.
So, you would have to know the rules on making a private key to remanufacture one like this.

Part of the problem with Bitcoin is that many people claim to be gung-ho about it, but still keep most of their money in fiat.
The more coins you have, it shows a higher trust in the currency.
It is a rude question, and not entirely accurate for a comparison (I only have like 0.2 BTC, because I don't have a lot of money to invest.), but it is the best question to ask for the moment.
If Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the question becomes less relevant.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:07:17
1]. With a Bitcoin ATM, it can be loaded with, let's say, 25 BTC. Worth around $15000. (I'm rounding). People use the ATM to buy 1 BTC worth of bitcoin, but in the interim the price jumps from $600 to $900. The remaining 24 BTC are now worth over $20k.
That means even more people can buy bitcoin without the owner loading more into it.
2]. Buying BTC for the purpose on saving it, and not spending it, counting on the price to increase.
3]. If you believe the goals of bitcoin, what we ultimately want is to be able to buy coffee with much, much less than 1 BTC. If you think that Bitcoin will succeed, owning 1 full bitcoin will make you a millionaire in time.

Unless the price jumps far above 1k, there is always the chance of it dipping back under.

Currently? Physical (compared to electronic money). But that's partially because payday is tomorrow, and I'm sitting on a portion of money for the rent.
The overall net worth of the US is approximately  $124T (as of 2014), but some of that value is in non-monetary sources, like real estate, meaning we shouldn't compare it with the value of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:33:24
That is the estimate of physical currency. I did specify that the number ignored other stores of value.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:43:56
The Mint prints money based on certain market conditions, including an estimate of how much money is lost or destroyed over the year. That's actually one advantage fiat has over bitcoin.
With bitcoin, if your computer gets fried with your wallet that contains 100BTC on it, that money is not just lost to you, it's lost to everyone. Forever.
But I'm not trying to draw a 1:1 parallel here. I'm saying that if we compare the 21M BTC that will be mined over the next few years to the amount of physical USD in circulation than the $1000 USD/BTC is low.
Adding in the extra values, and the amount goes up much, much higher.

If bitcoin becomes a true global currency, then the sky is the limit on value. Assuming the 21M Bitcoin is equivalent to the $1.2T in circulation in USD, then each bitcoin should be worth around $57,142. But that ignores current digital currencies, commodities, etc., which could raise Bitcoin even higher.
Edit for an afterthought: It is also possible that the whole experiment fails, making them end up worthless.

What makes Bitcoin analogous to a Physical Currency, as opposed to a Digital Currency, is the fact that a finite number of Bitcoin will be minted and actually in circulation.
It can be infinitely divided, and the services can be refigured to count mBTC as the whole unit, instead of BTC, but once the Block Reward runs out, there is no more coins printed.
Much like the USD has a limited amount of currency printed.

The way I see it, the price will eventually go above my costs anyway. By waiting for the sale, I won't lose money. I'll gain it.
Bitcoin miners generally are into bitcoin for a longer haul. They will short sell on occasion, but if they are consistently losing money, they will get out of the game.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:10:33
They are both factors.
Demand is most largely influenced by fear and emotion. Times like this, where the price is relatively flat, don't generate a lot of emotional stress, one way or another.
Fear of Missing Out helps to generate the spike in price, where everyone, including the buyers, tries to increase the price per share. This overinflates the price and creates a bubble ready to pop.
But, miners have to consider the price per coin when mining. If I had a miner going, and was getting 1 whole coin for every $500 in energy costs, I would put those coins on the exchange for no less than $500 each, unless I were desperately trying to get rid of them (at which point, I am not acting as a miner/manufacturer anymore)

The analysis Adam performs for that comparison is based on buying a house being more expensive than renting an apartment.
And in many cases, it is. Housing costs are higher in many places, and the fact that you might have to pay more per month *and* worry about repairs and improvements and insurance claims when a hurricane comes in... It can be a terrible investment.
But if a) you are not trying to flip the house for a profit, b) you do your diligence to buy a house in good condition, and c) the monthly payments are small enough compared to renting, then it absolutely makes more sense to buy than to rent.
Buying a home @ $500 a month (including taxes and insurance because I made a 50% down payment) vs renting an apartment @ $900 a month, even if the rent doesn't go up, means that in the course of a 30 year lifetime, I'd have the opportunity to save upwards of $144,000, plus the equity in the house.
What do I have to show with the apartment? Zip.

But it *does* have an impact on price.
Take a similar example. I reliably make 1 BTC for $450 cost over a long period, I then put them up on the exchange for $500, because I want to profit.
Well, no one buys, because the current price is only $250. But, I have a real job so I can pay my bills without selling.
The coins that I put up create a wall. Traders who look for these things will see that a growing number of coins are being offered at that high of a rate. The more I mine and put up, the more speculators will consider it to be a valid price.
If I reach a point where I have a large amount waiting to buy, it might overpower depressive emotions of buyers, and allow the stock to rise.
As long as I assume that bitcoin will ultimately grow to a viable international currency, it doesn't matter what I put my wall at. I may even decide not to sell for any price (removing the coins from the exchange entirely.)

That implies there is either a probability of a shark swimming in your pool or zero probability of matching wallets.
The answer of the odds being *insane* is accurate, probably even higher than the phony odds you made here, but let's not pretend that it is 100% impossible.
The wallet generation software creates a wallet fairly quickly, with more time needed to try and force a wallet that you want to get.
With 9e59 (ish) possible wallet addresses, the odds of matching a specific address is that insane rambling of odds.
But if a million people run a million operations per second for 12 days (a million seconds), then you cut those odds down to *only* 1 in 9e38.
Factor in again the number of currently existing wallets (11M), and that brings us to 1 in 7 Nonillion, or roughly the odds of hitting the Powerball 4 times in a row (but none of the other shenanigans)

Jury Nullification is a very necessary part of our system.
But for conviction, you need a unanimous verdict. For acquittal, you don't. While the prosecution can retry the case, they won't do that if they think the same result is likely.
And because of the way Nullification works, judges and prosecutors generally won't ask you about it during voir dire, as it can inject the idea in your mind.
If you have a convincing reason as to why you should be let off, and the crime was light enough, *and* you convinced a jury member already, then they aren't likely to continue pursuing the case. 
Obviously, if you can convince the entire jury, you're just out Scott free.

But if there is a fight between the BTX and BTC camps, there is going to be a period of time where the BTC still holds value, even as the BTX gains traction from being accepted by coinbase.
So, if you have a phone or computer-based wallet, and use the same wallet/key in the new BTX chain, you will have time to trade the BTC for an altcoin and into the BTX, effectively doubling your money.

Okay. Bitcoins are valued by their scarcity and the free market.
Only a certain amount of coins are mined in a set period of time, and they have costs to run the software and hardware for it.
This gives the miners a value they wish to sell a coin for. The less coin mined for more resources increases the prices.
The value is depressed by buyers, trying to get coins without mining more cheaply.
Positive and negative news generates interest, causing the depressive force of non-miner trading to increase or decrease, raising or lowering the price.
When the blockchain reward drops, you can expect to see a spike in prices, followed by a dip as the increased price brings in speculators.

Well, we can try to figure out the problems a Bitcoin version of Western Union would have.
First, there is the risk. Risk for this kind of business is minimal. You have the possibility of robbery and the possibility that one of the currencies involved collapses. The more currencies you hold, in more locations, the less you risk losing. Western Union currently edges out Bitcoin over this because they have more branches under trusted control (Love them or hate them, you aren't worried about Western Union closing their locations and running away with your money.)
Second, there is overhead. Western Union has much higher overhead costs, which partially justifies their fees. This includes advertising, maintenance, IT, and workers, as well as corporate employees, legal, regulation and taxes.
Western Union was, until 2006, part of the First Data Corporation, so had many ways of relieving any years of low performance. Bitcoin money transmission services don't have that protection.
My personal opinion is that if you wish to run such a service, you should have other methods of making money. BCMT can be pure profit, if the costs are handled elsewhere.

If it costs $10M, and literally 10 people need it in the whole world, then yes. $1M a dose is a valid price.
But there is no disease that I've ever heard of where only 10 people in the entire world have it.
Giving a more realistic "low-ball" number of 100,000 people (we are including people in the future that might need it), that means each dose would be worth about $100 in R&amp;D.

I buy a $100k house (small but not in bad shape) with a 50k down payment, and I'll be saving at least $400 a month in rent, probably more.
And even if the value of the same home plummets to $50k over the next 15-30 years, then I would still have $50k + whatever I put in savings out of the change in rent, instead of living in an apartment, and having the rent go up every year or two.

My reference to "unfair" was a codeword borrowed from the Occupy Wall Street idiots. Frankly, I worried that this currency would be easily embraced by them for its apparent anonymity, and wanted to flush them out.
The small amount of coin that I have gotten already is enough to put me over the hypothetical average I originally mentioned, but the biggest concern I actually have with that number is not how easy it would be to reach that level now, nor how hard it might be to reach it in the future, but rather that a currency where the base unit of measure ends up worth so much that most people don't even have one will be hard to sell to others.
If we used the mBTC or the satoshi as a base instead of the BTC, it would likely be more viable.

Most new currencies in the modern world are still based on an alternate monetary system during conception. The US dollar was fixed to the price of gold before it went fiat, and gift certificates are fixed to the price of a dollar.
In the case of bit coins, the fix is not on the price of the currency, buy on the amount of the currency. As more goods become available, the relative USD per BTC goes up, but if people feel unconfident in the system then they won't sell products or services, which lowers demand for the BTC and thus the value.
If we in the community wish for bit coins to become a globally viable currency (not necessarily the only global currency, of course), then we need to encourage more the selling of more products, including essentials like food and drink, more than we encourage blind transfers of coin.

If the currency is viable, then you basically hold on to it. Bitcoin's website had a dreaming goal of being able to buy a latte for 3 micro coins, which would make a single coin worth almost $100,000,000. But you are still looking at a tiny risk.
@_date: 2012-12-23 20:59:53
Using a bitcoin type model, it would be able to be traded to other people, allowing the buying and selling of goods not available from the entertainment industry. But it would likely be seen as similar to Facebook coins, you are right there.
But Facebook coins already do compete with bitcoin, just as the fiat currencies compete with bitcoin. Or rather, bitcoin is competing with all of them. My point here is that any new currency is in danger of failing based on competition and ease of use. Bitcoin is working on it, but it is not truly established yet.
@_date: 2012-12-22 22:39:19
Actually, all you would need is something similar, and adopted in a more popular venue.

But, you have to look at the reverse as well, when selling, you will be more likely to sell in dollars if the choice is $1.50 or 0.1 BTC, but more likely to sell in coins if it were 100 mBTC, theoretically.

I did try it out, since I am new to coins and didn't have any, and they are not bad. They don't have very many sites available to show, but you only have to look at them for 3 minutes each, and they send you about 0.0002 BTC per page.

I believe here he is confusing something regarding trade. You are able to buy, sell, and trade property you procured legally and did not copy.

Why would anyone be dumb enough to blow that much on two pizzas? But then I answered that before, when discussing the availability of goods for coin. But, consider the investment. $30 worth of pizza, if the person decides to cash out now for, what $140,000? Even if the price drops like a stone, he'd get a great profit, and assuming the currency fails he'd only really be out the two pizzas. But if the better scenario occurs, and the price goes up to 100 USD/BTC, he can make a cool million.
As an early adopter, his reward is huge, but his risk is minimal.
@_date: 2012-12-24 15:34:34
You are right that i mistook the exchange rates for the time the pizzas were bought, and understand that the 10k BTC was at the time worth about $41 usd. But that is still an insane risk to make on both ends. Would you be willing to trade $20 worth of merchandise for a lottery ticket that hasn't between drawn yet?
The guy who wanted the pizza would have done better for himself by selling the coins and using the proceeds to buy the pizzas himself, with the only extra factor being the timeframe of how long it takes to get the coins cashed.
And the buyer is taking a huge risk, that I hope paid off for him, though he might not have cashed out yet. 
At the time, the whole transaction was am incredibly risky maneuver, and i don't think i would have taken it.
On the other hand, now that the individual coin is worth more than $1, it isn't as risky of a move. I would be willing to accept 1.5 BTC and then use my debit card to order a pair of pizzas. The risk is still there, but it us much more safe.
@_date: 2012-12-23 16:05:32
Thank you for that.
But i am not trying to pick arbitrary timeframes, i am referring to now (or rather fairly close to now), followed by if it succeeds or fails. My point being that if we wake up tomorrow and it is shut down, most of us have not really lost much.
It does become rather different if my $1.50 total balloons to a million and we start using it for everything from groceries to rent to car payments. The increased dependence on the coin would increase the value.
That said, if i could find something i was able to buy for coins that i want our need, then any loss of bitcoin would be a greater loss to me.
@_date: 2012-12-23 15:32:26
I am very much on the fence, but I would be willing to accept bitcoins for my cheaper wares, in lieu of fiat cash, provided I can afford the shipping of course, and if i have the coin, and i find something i want to buy, I'll use it, but for larger transactions ($20 value or more) I'll still use dollars.

My friend, when it comes to these scams, the people like you, who have legitimately "earned" money on it (assuming you have already made back your "investment"), are just lucky enough to have lasted long enough.
For people like me, just starting out today, it's a better chance that I'll be struck by lightning than see a dime of it back, let alone make a profit.
It's called a pyramid scheme because it makes money solely from you signing more people up underneath you, who adds more money into the system.

So, he was doing it because a) he had so many coins he felt they were worthless and b) for shits and giggles
Mind you, this guy here is the one "losing $300,000 worth of coin" with his offer.
When I talk about the $14 lottery ticket, I am referring to the 3 possibilities that bit coin can go through. 1) The currency fails quickly, at which point I have lost my $14. 2) The currency fails after a period of growth, at which careful watching ensures I earn a profit, or 3) The currency succeeds, at which point I have a balance high enough to buy what I need without worry.

Well, one more day, and I'll pass the hypothetical "average" amount of BTC per living human on the planet.
It would be interesting to see all the stats on coin ownership and mining at one time.
@_date: 2012-12-22 22:34:24
Actually, I am saying almost nobody will even have a single coin. The individual bit coin, based on a comparison of the maximum potential of cons mined (21,000,000) to total US currency (about 1.5 trillion) makes each coin worth approximately $70,000. The value is further magnified if all world currency were to be considered, instead. However, the coin is only valued at $14 today, meaning we can buy multiple coins easily, and the only reason we have to spend them is to keep the fluidity of the currency to keep up the value.
As more goods and services are offered in the currency, it is automatically going to increase in value, or else it would automatically fail. Hoarders of large amount of coin (1000 or more) run an extreme risk because of the lack of fluidity.
@_date: 2012-12-24 19:57:14
I understand that the coins can be divided even beyond the satoshi, though we likely would not really need to. But imagine you are new to this currency, after it becomes more widely available. Would you want to buy in, knowing that you would get less than a single coin? It is a little demoralizing to see a bank balance like that, regardless of the value.
If, on the other hand, the satoshi were equivalent to the penny, in terms of reference and not value, it would seem much more accessible. Of course, that would mean that my $1.5 worth of coin would be 10,200 units, and not 0.102. As the currency gets stronger, and more things can be purchased with what is now a single coin, it will become more important to do.
@_date: 2012-12-22 22:45:59
By blind transfers of coin, i refer to the widespread tipping and donation, as opposed to purchases.
If people only use bit coin to donate to others, there is no real value to the coins.

Mintchip was, as you say, inferior. If the hypothetical new currency were to be equal to bitcoin, but simply more applied, then it would likely win out.

I mean the term "unfair" not as derogatory, but more in the manner of considering the newcomers to that system. Babies today won't have Wallets for years, and would never amass more than a single coin, if enough older people are hoarding that much.
In a system where more can be printed, you have a higher possibility of creating millionaires than in a system like this.

It is a virtual currency, in the fact there are no physical tokens.
Virtual is not an indication of whether the currency is real or not. Just an indication of whether it can be physically held and passed around.
Gems in Clash of Clans and Gold in World of Warcraft are "virtual scrips", a digital currency only valid at locations designated by the issuer (think Disney Bucks)
Bitcoin, like Linden Dollars for Second Life, are "virtual currencies" which can be passed directly between users and can be implemented to buy and sell anything you want.
Crypto only indicates the method in which the currency is distributed and transferred.

The difference being that with Bitcoin it is a measured increase of market forces that will cause the demand to rise. As the block reward drops to nothing, the transaction fees will become the larger portion of the miners income, and the prices will eventually steady to be based on the work required to earn that smaller sum.

Blockchains are a string of solved mathematical problems, each block containing the transactions from recent hours and a reference to the previous block.
When someone makes a change to how the blocks are calculated, like the Bitcoin Cash protocol, some systems will continue running the old method and some will run the new method. This creates a fork in the road, with both new currencies dependant on the older chain, but separate from each other.

Now, I'll amend by original statement to say "smaller transaction fees for smaller payments", as it can be quite cheap to send $1000 by Bitcoin, but things can get prohibitive if you are buying something small, like a single soda.
A store is not going to want to send $0.60 out of a $2 drink to the payment processor, and customers aren't going to be happy having to pay it themselves (bringing the price above $2.50)

The only thing I'm worried about saving myself from is boredom, o bastard son of a short bus driver.
But no, we disagree on the methodology of how to show the transaction fees of Bitcoin. I am opting for a realistic approach, and you are opting for a marketing approach.
And if you were trying to convince people to join Bitcoin, and you were willing to back up your numbers with instructions on how to ensure a reasonably fast transaction with a 0-10 sat/b fee, then it might be appreciated.
But you'd have to change your tone a lot.

You don't see how this could be confusing for an average person? In any other financial situation, the difference between banks (the closest non-bitcoin equivalent to a wallet is a bank account) is minimal, and focused on *benefits* to the user.
Ally has less overdraft fees, Wells Fargo has better ATMs, etc. But when you put your credit card into the reader at the store, you spend your money. Period.
But with Bitcoin, then one wallet costs more per transaction for the same. A transaction fee that is non-existent to them with any other payment system (because the stores include it with their pricing).
I personally understand that you might be able to force through a fast and cheap payment, depending on the time of day and the number of inflamed hairs on your mother's ass, but that doesn't help with wider adoption of Bitcoin.

Comparing to a 401k for one uear is kind of cheating, since the biggest benefit of one is long term savings, but a 401k with an 8% annular return with $50 contributions every two weeks would gain $55 in interest, for a total of $1355.
The "Bitcoin 401k", would have ended up at $1836, a gain of $536, assuming the last contribution was 13 days ago.
However, the volitility could just as easily have caused you to lose far more, depending on when you began your trades. If the price was falling overall over the past year, but steady, you could end up with only $1200.

Sure, if I were to buy in *now* for about $600, and it balloons to $300k, I can afford to be a little generous and give my mom or my brother a little bit, but it isn't going to last *even if I am stingy*.
That kind of money, I'd buy a cheap house (to lower my living expenses) and then I'd have to invest to grow the money further.

What you are asking about is a gamble.
Do you think the BTC is going to drop compared to your chosen altcoin? If so, then you can go ahead and make the switch. If you don't think so, then you shouldn't.
The ultimate question is this. Is bitcoin going up as part of a new upward trend that was simply paused for the last few months, or is this the beginning of a new bubble? And, in either case, will the final resting amount after this movement be higher or lower than today.
Personally? I'm hedging my bets a little. I get a small amount of BTC daily from pooled mining, and using Coinbase I am taking some of that, but not all of it, and switching it to the USD wallet.
If the price plummets, I can buy back the BTC at a much lower price. If it doesn't, I still make money from the held BTC balance.

Sadly, while a 401k can be generally predicted, the volitility of bitcoin makes it more of a gamble than an investment.
It easily could implode entirely, leaving you with nothing.
That said, the 401k *does* have a chance to beat the bitcoin performance when you factor in the employer contributions.
With 20 years to go, 10% of $80k personal, 3% employer contributions, and a 3% raise each year, you will end up with approx $639,500.
Bitcoin has an interesting problem... The higher the price of bitcoin, the less you can buy with $50... Any linear growth would need to end with a price of over $2.5M per coin to make the same $600k figure... Only exponential growth would make $50 biweekly contributions worth the time. Assuming every two weeks the price goes up by 1 more than the previous two weeks (tomorrow $371, Nov 21 $372, Dec 5 $374, etc), the price would be "only" $135,311 USD/BTC, but your balance would be $754,364.89.

That is true, but let's examine those numbers.
If you have $10,000 to invest, and the BTC price is $200, you can buy 50 BTC. When the price hits $50,000, you sell them for a cool $2.5 million dollars.

But, even then, the "winner" loses if the price goes down.
Right now, 100 BTC is about $22,000. If it goes down to $100, then the 200 BTC returned would be worth $20,000, a loss of $2,000.
The Bitcoin better loses the $22,000 only.
As for the other direction, they both spend $22,000, and the winner gets a $200,000 payday, earning $178,000 on the bet.
The only ways to make the loss and gains even is to make the bets weighted (when considering them in bitcoin, the better option) or to separate the bets entirely or to base the bet in the static currency (USD)
 The Fiat Better sets aside $10,000, enough to buy 10 BTC if he loses.The Bitcoin Better sets aside 100 BTC, (currently worth $22,000, but only worth $10,000 if he loses). In this manner, regardless of who loses the bet, they gain the same amount of money.
Or, they can just bet $10,000 and if either one decides to get BTC with the winnings, they can.

Individual exchanges come up with their price based on what you, the seller are willing to pay. The same thing happens in any market based stock.
Let's say you have 250 BTC, and you want to sell them. How much do *you* want for them?
Well, you put in the order for 25,000 USD ($100/BTC), because that's all you really want for it.
I, on the other hand, want to buy 100 BTC for up to $25,000, so I put in an order. The system gives you $10,000 for your 100 BTC, and puts in the remaining 150 BTC for the next person. The price, and the going rate, is $100.
But what if it is reversed? I want to buy 250 for $25,000 and you want to sell 100 for the same sum ($250/BTC)? A buy and sell order for each will be put in. Assuming no other buyers are in the system, we know the price is between $100 and $250. When one of us decides to change our offer, the price can be pegged down.
In general, the buyer is most protected, buying new stock at the rate the seller wanted, the seller has the option of naming his price.
Large holders of stock can set a high price, and effectively tell people that he believes the stock is worth more (known as a sell wall). This can have the effect of creating a bubble on the market, causing initial resistance to the growth of the price, and running away after the level is breached.
Back to Bitpay, they look at the individual exchanges, determine based on past history if the price needs to be adjusted (some exchanges require hoops to jump through to get money on the exchange, which can affect the trading prices), and probably err on the side of a lower figure to ensure their profit.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:48:01

Miners can elect to require a higher transaction fee to accept a transaction into a block, with lower transaction fees getting lost until miners who allow lower fees have space for them.
As time moves on, the price moves up, and more transactions are performed, there will be less room for low-fee transactions.
That said, if the miners don't drop their fee threshold to a reasonable level (current averages put a transaction as costing more than a dollar to perform quickly), it will be a detriment to bitcoin's adoption as a valid currency.

But, what do the servers do?
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:29:00
Because the price of bitcoin goes up in response to a pending reward halving.
As long as the cost of mining is less than the reward (based on the current price of bitcoin), it is profitable to run the machinery. And some miners may take small periods of time at a loss for a greater gain later on.
For example, you pay $50/month in electricity costs to mine, and gain 0.05 BTC. Right now, that's a loss of $15, but if the price of BTC goes up above $1000, you profit. (And extreme example, and many miners won't accept that level of loss)

If you mean a system like Coinbase, the wallet you sent your coins into is a temporary location to identify that you are the sender and marks it in their system as yours.
Then the coins are dumped into a group of holding accounts until people request a withdrawal, which will come from a different wallet.
In that manner, the in-bound and outbound traffic is separated and easily recognizable, and allows for instant use of the money without waiting for the deposit to confirm.

How would you get BTC (assuming you don't have a mining rig already, thank you) without one?
The only real ways are to buy BTC for USD, which requires identity in the US, to buy items that can be sold for BTC, or to mine it.

If too many people are hoarding Bitcoin then less business is being transacted with it. If less business is transacted, then people will be less likely to attempt to do business with it.
This is what liquidity is. Not the available amount of money, not the ability to divide the money. The ability to spend the money.
If the market dries up because too many people are hoarding, then the ones buying products *with* BTC will have to spent more for the same item.
No one will buy one BTC for $100 if it costs 0.1 BTC for a 20oz soda. Only by encouraging trade can the currency grow.
If more people are getting the small amounts of coin from mining at a regular basis, they would be more likely to be willing to spend it. On one hand, it is a small amount of money. On the other hand, they will be getting more of it. If they simply buy $100 or $1000 worth, and are encouraged to hold onto it, they would be far less likely to spend it at all.

If roads are provided privately alone, then they will be different in different areas. Cars and trucks that are designed for a Kentucky road might have trouble in Tennessee. To make sure they are uniform, they must be created by the same people.
If police are handled privately, who ensures that the people not directly paying them are protected? As a governmental agency, the police are paid by the people, and are charged with all of their protection.
If the fire department were private, the only reason to stop fires is to protect the homes of the hiring party.
If the military were only private, they would be focused not on the protection of the country, but on the company that provisioned them.
There are many areas that should not be in the purview of government, but there must be some form of government.

Not true. There are winners and losers, but thanks to mining efforts, new coins are made available to be sold for profit in fiat or used to buy items. This increases the number of winners, as it allows more people to buy coins without mining.

I think, ultimately, a central bank of some sort is a requirement for any sort of currency.

Certainly there are benefits to standardization, but you forget that many companies don't think in those terms. Look at the USB interface for computers. It was designed to be a standard connection, and most computers have it, but different devices have different connections going to it. Why? so you can't use a Samsung charger on an Apple phone.
Road building companies will only work together as far as it benefits them individually. If one area can not afford to keep to the same standards as the neighboring city, then the quality of those roads will decline. The only way that the smaller city can keep up is by having its citizens pay extra to fund the roads. That is to say, they must be taxed.

This is why I think we should reconfigure the systems to count 1 BTC (under the current system) as 10 or even 100 BTC. From a psychological point of view, no one wants to sell a product for $0.05, even if that is the actual value.
When they designed the system, they put the base so high because they didn't want to have a crazy "100000000 BTC" (That's 100 BTC as we know it, but with the Satoshi equaling 0.01 hypothetical BTC) bonus for clearing the earlier blocks.

Not sure there. I wasn't in the market for a Furby at the time.
My point is that 'monetary value' simply means that it is possible to trade it for money. Coupons have a monetary value of 1/10 of a cent. Cars and collectibles have a monetary value. More importantly, it is legal in much of the US to hold gaming style fund raisers, provided none of the prizes are money. Even gift certificates are allowed. The question is "Is bitcoin a currency, or is bitcoin a certificate?"

There is a school of thought in investment that it is better to buy small amounts at regular intervals as opposed to one large purchase. If the price goes up, you gain money, and if the price goes down, you lower the purchase price per share, allowing greater profit at lower peaks.

Honestly, how is that different from *any* currency, including Bitcoin?
A currency is merely a note indicating the value of a good or service that is recognized by the public at large. If people were to lose confidence in the USD and start trading exclusively in BTC, the dollar would be worthless. But because I can go to any store with $2 and buy a soda (provided they sell soda there), the dollar has value.

But it is not guaranteed that the 49% hash group doesn't get two blocks in a row. The average is that half would be gotten by them, but occasionally they will get two or three in a row.

That is certainly a possibility, but the ultimate decision will fall to how people react to the reward drops each time.

That is, this block might give 25.5 coins, and the first lower block might give 13, while the next drop give 6.75...

Not true. By securing the Bitcoin network, you help build the strength of the Coin's value.
The more people that take your advice, and buy BTC and hold it, the weaker the Network and the less valued the coins are.
With more people mining, the coins could be worth $150. Without people mining, the coins could be worth $120. That makes the mining more profitable, as a group.
Individually, you are correct, but you are giving your advice to a group.

I know that the more computers you have running the mining software, the greater chance you have of finding each block.

That to me seems like a flaw in the system. Why does the system need to show the path every piece of your payment every time it is spent? And why, if the fees are meant to be per transaction, are you going to punish someone for getting small payments in and making one larger payment out? That seems to disproportionately favor people who do large business transactions, which seems to be opposed to the "open, available to all" payment system we are trying for.
Then again, it brings me closer to the conclusion that the Bitcoin block chain needs to be used solely for large banking-style transactions and Ripple, or something similar where payments are not written to the chain, should be used for small transactions.

First, Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, etc. products have shelf lives measured in years, not months.
Second, these companies don't have a habit of running your new computers for months before shipping when they're already delayed.
Third, these companies will contact you or the retailer proactively to inform you they are delayed and generally will allow the option to back out with a full refund.
And finally, these companies would allow individual purchases and would ship these individual units as they are finally manufactured.

Bitcoin is a private currency, but transferring USD into BTC gives BTC a value. It isn't as much the income in BTC that you'd have to worry about, but the income in USD you'd be getting from trading.
Example: You make candles to sell for BTC online. Somehow, you must pay for candle supplies (wicks, wax, etc.), the roof over your head, your transportation (assuming you are buying locally), and your shipping. Eventually, you are going to need to take in USD, which **are** controlled by the state. 
As long as USD are required for day-to-day business, you would have a point in saying that BTC should not be taxed. But if it ever gets to the point where you can do practically anything with BTC that you can do with USD (buying a house, paying rent, buying groceries, paying your car insurance, etc), then the BTC can be subject to control.

My point, that you are ignoring, is that governments are given power by the people in them.
Ultimately, if you owe any person enough money, they may place a lien on your property. Such a document can be used to force you from your land if you continue to not pay what you owe.
Because certain services must be provided by a central government, and these services require money to operate, the government requires money from its citizens. 
While property tax may be a bad way of going about receiving this money, and income taxes are legitimately unfair to higher earners, the fact remains it is money owed. If you choose to not report your earnings to decrease how much you pay, knowing that is against the law, then you alone are responsible for those penalties.
 Personally, I believe we spend too much as a country, and we owe too much to other countries. I would prefer that we cut all nonessential services out entirely, and pay our national debt completely. But, if I just state, "I won't pay", then I am not helping the situation at all.

It is an interesting concept. Basically, you give me an IOU worth x amount of any currency and I send it to another person as payment for a service.
Ideally, the IOU that you gave me was backed by a deposit in an exchange like Bitstamp, so the money has value.
You can also use it among friends as a ledger of debts without transferring money.
Basically, if I trust Bitstamp, you can send me Bitstamp IOUs, which I can redeem for real money.
If I trust you, But not Bitstamp, then you can send me an unbacked IOU, which I must redeem from you.

OpenCoin will make money through the sale of XRPs, currently none (but they have a smallish team and are trying to get the technology more widely available; BTC/XRP transactions are P2P), but over time they will stop giving away XRP and people will need to buy them to get along.

Well, I can somewhat understand the blades being expensive, as they are much larger. Not only are they more powerful, but they would be more expensive to ship. But that doesn't quite explain about the USB miners, which are sold for a much higher hash:price ratio, but would be immeasurably easier to ship. If they were to create a batch of 300 and sell them piecemeal, they'd be able to get these devices into more individual's hands, as opposed to solely the early adopters who now have millions of dollars to blow.
I'm not saying that these early adopters should be allowed to have any, but rather that the method in which these miners are sold and shipped favors those who (A) have a lot of extra money to spend already and (B) have a stockpile of coin available so they can afford to wait for long periods for receipt.

What happens when those 'tiny-tiny amounts' are the normal transactions? A less than 5¢ transaction now could potentially be worth $500, with the same limitations on spending, like having to aggregate small transactions together to make a larger purchase.
But how does one combine dust transactions into a larger token, and thus prevent the issue of not being able to spend money due to growing fees? Being able to combine dust sources into whole bitcents would be something dust collectors would need to know.

But if people are still trying to buy Zhou Tong IOUs, he'd get valid XRP for them and buy valid Bit stamp IOUs with them for you.

The state is given that power by the people at large. Despite the popularity of BTC, it still represents a small portion of the population.
While I agree that the governments of the world have become monsters, with too much power, there are some things that require taxation and control, like roads, police, fire, and military, and those things should be paid for relatively equally.
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:07:23
It should be up to the employer, I think. Some might go with a commission system, where the compensation is based on the actual number of BTC received, instead of on the number of hours worked. Some might go with a low, but relatively static, amount that I described. And some might go with a higher amount that scales down more often that you are describing.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:53:10
Actually, if I am understanding this correctly, you can get dinged for this any time you send a transaction many times over what you take in. If you normally sell trinkets for 50 mBTC and wanted to buy a car for 100 BTC, it would try to send out 2000 transactions of 50 mBTC to cover it, when it could only need to send 1 transaction of 100 BTC. This alone clears up a lot of space for smaller transactions to go through.
Yes, it was designed to limit dust transactions, but I am saying that we don't **need** to use such a method of limitation. If the minimum transaction fee were set at a certain rate, based on the average value of BTC, and every transaction was only one line of code, regardless of how many sources, then the chain won't be bogged down when a dust collector sends his money, the miners get a more standardized amount of transactions per block, and people wouldn't have to worry about what sources their transactions came from to make any sort of purchase.
 The way the transactions are currently recorded is severely limiting our potential for growth, however, because some people can not mine coins effectively and are forced to either buy in increasing amounts or collect dust. We need to stem this problem now, while it still only affects people randomly, or it will become a major problem when the transactions we call 'dust' now are what we use normally.

State can refer to any governmental unit that acts autonomously compared to others. In the US and Mexico, "states" are the subdivisions of the countries. In Canada, the same subdivisions are called "provinces".
The bodega on the corner isn't acting as a money transmitter when you withdraw from the ATM. The owner and operator of the ATM (generally the associated bank) is the money transmitter and are registered this way.
I have yet to see a company inside the United States that refuses to accept USD for transactions. At the current level of spending, BTC is less like a currency, and more like a scrip. For those unfamiliar with the term, a scrip is an unofficial currency used in localized areas for various reasons, including scarcity of official currencies or for novelty reasons. (Think Disney Dollars for the second one.)

Well, based on my calculations, if Bitcoin were to be adopted worldwide, as hoped, a single BTC would be equal to more money I have made in my lifetime.

There is a point to this phrasing of the question.
If you have $20 USD in your pocket/bank account, you don't have to get out your phone, scan the QR code, send the money, and wait for the clerk who doesn't understand Bitcoin (because it wasn't their decision to use it) to figure out how to check if the payment went through.
Plus, the dollar is likely to lose value, and the BTC is likely to hold or raise value (in the long run, making all valid assumptions), so it would be better financially to use USD over BTC if you have both ready.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:18:55

Even so, at the current market price, that's $70,000 extra profit on top of the sales, $70,000 that could have been mined by the purchasers if they had just been given the devices earlier.

Of course, it should be fair to warn readers that if it doesn't get adopted, it will be worth not much.

They're not as powerful as Avalons but BTC Guild is selling USB ASICs (330Mhash) for 0.60 BTC. I ordered one a little over a week ago, and they shipped it today.
But what really sets them apart is that they include what point in the sales queue you are, the estimated time the Miner will arrive with them (including changing that date if new info comes out), and the tracking number for the USPS shipping.
Plus, because I bought one just before they dropped the price from 1.05 BTC, they are promising that I'll be able to buy a second for 0.15 BTC.

Honestly, I only have about 1 coin, and it is hard as anything to make that grow.
With the price as high as it is, and the inability to buy less than 0.1 BTC at a time, it is simply too hard for me to buy more. I'll still offer to sell product for coin, and will definitely consider alternative ways of getting coin for USD, like trading for stays at the hotel I work at.
If we want everybody to be using this, we need to make it easier to trade fiat money for it, however.

Dude, the only reason they didn't have the asic sooner was because Avalon was deliberately withholding the stock and using them to mine coins for themselves. It's like saying that you shouldn't be angry that you are getting a car with 10,000 miles on it but told it was 'new'.

I wasn't being 100% serious, but with such a long delay, it isn't out the realm of possibility. At the very least, they are further delaying the shipment of other devices to accommodate each individual complaint, which seems okay if you are the one being expedited, but if you've already waited for over a year...
Plus, people paid for these things based on what they could have made 12 months ago, and at this point might not be able to make their money back now.
But with such a long delay, you have to ask why it occurred. Were the devices not ready for production? If that is the case, it is irresponsible to take so many preorders. Or were they created and being utilized for "testing purposes" or "burn-in procedures", with the company keeping the coins mined on top of the customer fees?
It is not a crazy thought, since other ASIC creators did the exact same thing.

Paying BTC is currently linked to USD partially because there are few ways to get BTC without paying USD. If bitcoin ever becomes a legitimate currency, people will need to have some way of being paid directly in BTC, instead of in USD. 
A partial benefit in BTC on top of the normal wage is, in my opinion, the best first step toward that. Yes, it would be volatile, and it would require adjustments at times to prevent too high of a compensation, but it would get coins to the average person without the need for exchanges or payment transfers or anything like that. Couple that with an information packet on how to spend BTC, like using Gyft, and people will be happy to get the extra benefits. Plus, the heightened liquidity will push the price up naturally so people who were among these first companies could end up with a hefty savings.
It's still too early to suggest a BTC-only wage, though.

Well, if there was a very minor fee removed from the price, and it became popular enough, there could be profit made without fraud.
If they start with a price of 0.01 BTC, and increase the price by 10%, rounded up to the nearest 0.01 BTC each purchase, with 9% going to the old buyer and 1% going to the site owner, only the last person standing runs the risk of loss. The site can then "reward" that person with an item of some value that nominally is less than what they paid, but is unique and otherwise unavailable for purchase.
By putting advertising on the site, the value of the prize can increase.
If you go with my settings, after 100 purchases, the gem would have been bought for 338 BTC, and a prize with a value of $300 can be offered. Technically not a scam as much as a gamble, especially if the risks are fully understood.

Eventually, the governments would pass laws stating that BTC is taxable.
And because the blockchain is freely available to the public, it is possible to make a map of who is buying from who and for how much, even if what they are buying is obscured.

The chart seems to be confusing. The stuff on the right is less likely, the stuff on the left is more likely, and the stuff immediately left of the timeline is possible, but unlikely.
A digital currency being universally accepted in the US by 2015 is given, in US terms, 5 to 1 odds for success. Meaning for every $5 you bet that bit coin works, they'll only pay out $1. It means they have a high amount of confidence that it will be true.
But, then again, they also give fairly good odds for the disappearance of the polar ice caps, and don't even realize that we already have online games based on location data and the Google Maps API. So, their numbers may be greatly off.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:39:35
Actually, businesses have been doing that for quite some time now. It's called accepting checks.
If you went to a grocery store, they'd likely accept a check written by you from any of the major banks, even if they'd never seen you before. In the Ripple analogy, the 'check' is the IOU, obviously, and the Gateway is the issuing bank. But Ripple has a distinct advantage to paper checks. You can only 'write a check' for the amount of money the Gateway owes you. The merchant doesn't trust you at all, they trust your Gateway to deliver.

The city saves money on processing, but the customer flits that bill instead, that is if they want a speedy transaction. And most businesses will require the speedy transaction.

Any long distance exchange has such risk. After all, if I physically hand you a $20 bill, it has a chance of losing value before you have a chance to spend it. The reason why we trust that it is an appropriate value for our product is because the government backs it.
A Bitcoin IOU is no different. You trust that the gateway, Bitstamp, is going to value the IOU appropriately and will give you the actual BTC if you request it, therefore the coin has value.
You should generally never trust me, individually, unless I am working as a gateway for a currency. You would trust the common gateway, so that you may be assured that.your funds have value.
To put things in simpler terms, BTC is like the USD. Ripple is PayPal. You put money into the account and use it to trade back and forth to others.
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:46:38
I would list Bitcoin as a temporarily deflationary currency. In its current state, the value of each coin rises us to the difficulty in mining New coins as well as the drop in block reward. As the upper limit is reached, and reward shrinks only to the amount of transaction fees from the block, that deflation should end, creating a stable currency that only changes value based on the liquidity of transfers.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:43:46

If you limit your trust to only those parties you actually trust, such as Gateways that have a proven record, false coin attacks can not affect you. Bitstamp will never accept an IOU from the guy that magicked 100,000,000 BTC out of thin air. So, if you only trust Bitstamp, you can accept coins from anyone safely.

For those that adopted early, yes, those extra leading zeros are impressive. But for those who are newer, it is daunting.
I mean, just a few weeks ago, you could put in less than a dollar and get a small amount of coin, now (at least at bitfinex) you need to have over $10 available before they allow you to make a purchase.
Unless you are looking at something that has to be bought in BTC with no other option, it's slowly becoming not worth it.
Imagine, if you will, when the price gets up to $1000 or $10,000 and you'd have to have $100-$1000 cash to buy in.

I would argue, however, that while Bitcoin is not backed by a government, it is still a fiat currency. We, the people who are using the coin as an alternative to the USD and other governmental currencies, have decreed its value. The popular definition of fiat is that the value is not based on a static commodity, such as gold. In that regard, the US Dollar is equal to the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:49:05
No. I described how this number system is supposed to work. We are operating under a false sense of rarity in bitcoins because we are referring to the whole coin in our dialog, and not the intended base currency. This false rarity is exactly the same as you have in the diamond market. There would be little urgency in buying into the system if we were referring to the price per satoshi, as there are already more than a quadrillion of them available. More than the entire monetary supply in physical cents nationwide.
 As for my classification of them as "not real", they are information. There is no physical form to them, the magnetic lines on the hard drives are indistinguishable from any other type of mathematical coin, or any other digital monetary transaction, or even a pornographic image. These digital tokens don't even have to be passed digitally to be transferred.

Actually, most governments are okay with casino-style games, as long as you can not easily change the items won for money. 
Video Arcades do this all the time, where you win tickets or tokens, then take the tokens to get prizes like stuffed animals and other toys. In order to get money from this, you'd have to take the toy and sell it to someone else. 
In Japan, Pachinko parlors have a guy next door or outside the building that buys back extra balls, but in America that trick might be used to show you are a casino.
Considering the fact that if I want to take money, play the casino games, and get cash back, I have to send money to virvox, change the USD for SLL, then the SLL for BTC, a process that takes about a day, then transfer the BTC to the casino and gamble with it, take the new BTC balance back to virvox, buy SLL with BTC, transfer the SLL to Second Life, sell the SLL there for USD, and then send the USD to paypal (the process is faster with SL than Virvox for getting money back)... I don't think they can easily prove that the tokens have monetary value.

Honestly, currencies rarely have a truly fixed exchange rate. It can only can be a mostly fixed rate.

Oh, there are problems with it for sure. But the problem with BTC is that even with the infinite length of the chain, the links in that chain (the blocks) are of finite length. 
The 'recommended' transaction fee is currently at $0.08 (0.0005 BTC) per trade. And it will only get higher as the price of bitcoins goes up. Because of this, less people will want to use BTC to pay for little costs, like the morning coffee, and mainly larger transactions will go through.
I think, ultimately, we will require the use of a number of ripple-like systems to handle day-to-day BTC transactions, with the blockchain operating as an interbank system.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:46:13
I'm sorry, but if Bitcoin is to become a new global currency, we need to accept all newcomers and get them involved, even in pure greed.
One thing that we should probably do is start talking about USD in terms of BTC, and not the other way around. If the exchanges were to allow you to buy $1 at a time, and give a number of BTC based on the exchange rate, instead of buying 1 BTC and having it cost more and more money.
If Bitcoin is meant, ultimately, to be able to buy a latte for 3 satoshi (a claim I read on a bitcoin site, but I forget which), then we need to be able to buy in to these smaller amounts. When Bitcoin is fully implemented, 1 BTC is going to be a fortune.

I think you are wrong. Just because they are not 'masculine' doesn't mean that they are homosexual. This show is about negating that very stereotype. 
The first scene you reference is one of the worst examples you can point out, where Sheldon just spent the entire episode trying to solve a particularly hard problem and had snuck into the restaurant to use the balls to represent atoms after hours. The guard there called Leonard in because he thought that Sheldon was 'special' and what you saw there was Leonard trying badly to get Sheldon back home. It doesn't anywhere imply a sexual relationship between Leonard and Sheldon, but rather a quasi-father/son relationship. Ultimately, Sheldon is a child whose mother sheltered him so badly that he never grew up.
The Aquaman and Batman are the two that I mentioned, Raj and Howard. They have an epic bromance going, to the point of Raj actng at times like the woman in a 'relationship', but that is only for laughs and many non-nerd centered shows have a similar dynamic.
The Batman punch is about that fact that Howard is a weakling.
"Oh Lord, my belly" was the culmination of an entire episode where Sheldon was trying to extend his lifespan via a change in diet. He had a whole meal of brussell's sprouts, which he had never done before, and was mistaking his gas for appendicitis. A very important lesson in "a little knowledge is a bad thing".
Zazzles... was just him being crazy. He claims that he was tested by his mother, but we all know he's nuts.

Assuming that you intend on paying your taxes properly, BTC is an investment, much like a stock or bond, only more easily trade-able. The original value is fixed when the person trades USD for BTC, and again when traded back from BTC to USD. If you buy 3 BTC for $50 each, and trade me those 3 BTC for a painting, and I sell the 3 BTC for $55, you would have a painting fixed at $150 that you can try to sell later. I would have earned $165 minus the cost of creating the painting, which would be taxable.

I realize you're an ass, but let's keep this civil.
What you are forgetting is that they were telling us that these units were being sold new, that they had to be sold at a certain rate because of the increased cost to manufacture, that they were delayed because they had to build them before shipping. 
In reality, they were using these units for months before shipping. Assuming they *only* had 90 gigahash running at a time (300 units at 300 megahash), that's over $10,000 that they could have used to offset some of the costs for the customers each month. Mind you, that 'savings' to the customer would be about $30 per unit, but that could still make the difference between someone being able to buy it or not.
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:16:08
Yes and no. The more hashing power, the more often coins are mined, because more calculations occur per second. Currently, that's a rate of one solved block per ten minutes, approximately, or 3600 BTC per day. If the hash rate doubles quickly, they could push mining to 7200 a day until the reward is halved.
The limitations to how much is mined is based on the difficulty of the block, not on an arbitrary length of time between rewards.

From what I understand about mining, each and every node active in mining has an equal chance of recovering the block and receiving the reward.
Larger operations have a greater chance because they have more nodes, but they are not simply given bitcoins based on how much power they use. Otherwise, it would be worth it to have an individual mining at home, getting small amounts of satoshi, but building up over the course of a year our two.
Large mining operations are able to pay out in that manner because they represent such a large amount of the mining community that they know they'll complete blocks regularly.

This reasoning of yours is so stupid, I must believe that you said it on purpose.
**Of course the BTC wouldn't be $100 if a soda costs 0.1 BTC, that was my exact point.**
When the guy, years ago, bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, that showed how much he, at the time, valued them. Less than a penny a piece. They were worth so little because there were few people mining at the time, meaning each miner had a larger chance at completing a block, and there was few things available to buy with it.
Liquidity in a currency is the ease in which trade can occur. The more people that are willing to trade, the higher liquidity. In an emerging market, like Bitcoin's, it requires people willing to accept Bitcoin for their goods and services, as well as people *willing to buy goods and services* for Bitcoin.
Your advice to hoard coins lowers the number of buyers in this market. And the lower availability of buyers lowers the number of willing sellers.


I am not confused at all. You just don't seem to understand.
@_date: 2013-09-17 11:23:51
Hoarding will cause the value to plummet, if it becomes detrimental to buying and selling. You have to remember that Bitcoin is a currency and not a product.
If I were to hoard Twinkies, buying every one that I had access to, I could eventually cause the price of Twinkies to go up. But Bitcoin is not a Twinkie.
As proof of what I am referring to, look at what would happen in the super-rich in America were to start hoarding their money. That means they would stop investing, and buy considerably less. That lack of money being put into the market would be met with rising prices, as the sellers would need higher profit margins.
If you want a real-world example of my meaning, if I were to sell products, as an individual, I would simply need to make an extra $70 a day to match my current wage. If I can sell 100 items a day, I'd only need to make $0.70 per item for profit. But if I can only sell 10 in a day, I'd need to get $7 in profit, per item. This is what I mean about liquidity. By hording money, others are less likely to buy products, and sellers have to raise prices to meet their profit goals.

Right now, most systems probably can't handle a $20k transaction directly and immediately.
The Client would get an account at a Gateway, like bitstamp, and deposit the money into Ripple, placing an IOU into their wallet. You would trust the same Gateway (not the client), and have an account set up there. He sends you the IOU for $20k. You can then choose to trade it for a different currency (like if you wanted BTC and not USD) and then withdraw it from bitstamp.
Or, you can leave some or all of it in Ripple, and use it to pay others there.
In theory, if bitstamp is doing things *right*, they have every dollar and every bitcoin they have out in IOUs sitting in a reserve.

As far as the 'why', using Ripple can lessen the number of transactions recorded in the blockchain, giving a longer timeframe before we have to worry about raising the transaction fees (which are already going up, when you consider the rising prices of bitcoin). It can also be used to change money from more currencies than any one exchange can.
The inherent risk is in the newness of the system.

Well, it's more like trying to chase a loss with a higher bet, knowing the unlikelihood that you will lose twice in a row with a high enough odds. It is possible, as seen with the OP and the poor unlucky sap, that you get a string of bad luck, but most people will be able to recoup their losses and do better than even, assuming there is no take for the house.
Example using a straight Martingale - You start with 0.01 (the minimum bet) with 50% odds of winning 1.9x the amount, and by luck you win once, and lose once every time, doubling the bet on a loss. SD pays 0.0005 for a loss.
Bet 1 - 0.01 - Win - 0.019 - (+0.009)
Bet 2 - 0.01 - Loss - 0.0005 - (-0.0005)
Bet 3 - 0.02 - Win - 0.038 - (+0.0175)
Bet 4 - 0.02 - Loss - 0.0005 - (-0.002)
Like any casino, a loss of revenue to them is touted as a way of showing that you can actually win, drawing a greater crowd of people to try their luck. And if too many people use such a system and win too much, they can tweak the numbers, either by lowering the payout amount, increasing transfer fees, or changing the maximum and minimum bets, so they don't lose too much at any given time.

Wrong. I am saying that they won't buy BTC for $100 if a soda costs 0.1. They would buy it for closer to $17. (A soda costs $1.69 at the local store here).


In a normal economic system, the price would decrease. However, Bitcoin is far from normal. The price per coin fluctuates wildly because of speculation, making most merchants price themselves in USD and not BTC.




Hoarding money is primarily a bad thing in a market. Because no one can tell how much is actually available for trade, they have to assume it all is available. Even the overly rich openly saying "I will not spend" doesn't relieve this, because they may change their mind.
And because of this, we can only perform a certain number of transations. If we assume that half of the available currency is being horded, we would have only 5.5 MBTC available, but 11 MBTC would be visible. If that were to be noticed, the prices for goods would skyrocket, and the BTC would reactively plummet.
Basically, what I am saying for you to do is **keep your advice to hoard money to yourself if you want the value to go up**.

If the price drops, and people start shorting in that manner, say bringing the price back down to $30, I'd probably do better continuing to lend USD, and trading for BTC afterward.
If I trade my USD for BTC now, I'd get about 1.5 BTC, and can expect about 0.015 gains in a week, with my value dropping from $120 to $45.
If I wait, I'd get about 4 BTC.

Also, more common use of off-chain transactions, such as Ripple (not necessariy that one, of course), would decrease the strain on the transation limits.

I'm mulling about Ripple, myself. I think the only valid way that it can be used is to decrease the number of bitcoin transactions being put into the blockchain.
If BTC were to be put into Ripple, they can be traded once or a hundred times before being removed from Ripple into a Wallet. Of course, then you run the risk of Ripple itself folding or being used incorrectly...
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:05:35
If ripple wants to become viable as a P2P exchange, they need to allow any account to set up their own desired exchange rate for any currency. Have a setting for each currency, including extra ones like SLL (Second Life Lindens) to be traded for XRP. You can change the rates any time, but only manually.
Then when a user puts in a trade request, the system finds the target rate that accepts IOUs from the same exchange, and completes it automatically. If you don't want to receive a certain currency, you don't set a rate for it.

What is a milliard? I'm assuming you mean million.
But, the flaw in his plan is that only people stupid enough to trust him personally would get those fake Bitcoins. Even if he tried trading them for XRP, the system doesn't buy from OpenCoin, they buy from another user. He would need 3 accounts, the issuing account to create the coins and send them to the seller account, then he'd need to fund a buyer account with XRP to buy them. In the end, he's still holding the same amount of bad coins and the same amount of XRP.

I also don't get enough people asking to use Euros to justify signing up for a company to trade them for me. Therefore, I leave it up to you, the buyer, to get Dollars for me to sell you my wares.

If it drops all the way back to $3, again, I don't see a lot of people gaining confidence in it. Bitcoin at that point would be nothing more than a stock without a product, and only good for earning more fiat currency.
 As I have said elsewhere, we need to get off of telling the price of BTC in USD, and start telling it the other way.
Set up the exchange to buy $1 worth of bitcoin regardless of the price, so that new investors and proponents can join in without needing hundreds of dollars on hand. Have more stores online sell products or services for BTC without raising or lowering the price every few minutes.
We need to know that, for example, 0.01 BTC will buy a soda, if we expect it to be used as a currency. And we need these stores to be publicly available, not on Tor.
With this volatility, and the fact that you can't buy everything you want with it, would you accept this as a form of payment? Certainly not, if you are running a business, paying employees, renting a shop, and buying inventory from a fiat merchant. Because you wouldn't be able to afford going to sleep at night with $200,000 in the bank, and waking up to $100,000 or less.

Problem with this. If you are on Week 40 and the price drops 25%, you'll need to put in $11,000 just to stay on track.
It means you will need to have a substantial sum of cash available in addition to your $50,000 target. That sum should be no less than the target amount times the expected volatility. Since Bitcoin has gone though dips to 3% of its original value before, a $50,000 investment point would require $1,650,000 to guarantee completion.

I am not arguing based on charity. I am arguing based on increasing the community as a whole for better overall profitability.
If you succeed, and a large number of miners quite mining and simply buy BTC, then the hashrate drops. If the hashrate drops, then the remaining miners gain BTC more easily. If miners earn more easily, the value of an individual coins goes down.
When you include the advice to horde BTC, instead of spending it, you decrease liquidity of Bit coin, which also decreases value.
On the other hand, more miners makes it harder to earn coins, making them more valuable. 
In the two situations, you have two outcomes. If less people mine, the coins would be worth less. A 1 BTC investment, currently the cost of half a dozen USB miners, might be worth $150. Buying them now would mean a gain of $15.
If more people mine, they would be worth more. Buying 1 BTC worth of Erupters might net you only 0.9 actual BTC, but they are worth $200/coin. A gain of $45.
Of course, these numbers are purely speculation, which is all you have for consideration as well, but your advice to non mine and simply horde coins is better suited for individuals, as you would be relying on a growing mining base to maximize your own profit.
If you were to horde that 1 BTC, buying now, and the rest of us mine as we are, then you would have gained more than we did. But without us, you would have gained less.

I guess there is that, but the way I was reading it, it sounded like the system was forcing the 90% transaction fee from OP, and not his client.

My "opinion" was that I can not mine efficiently at 1 kilohash/s. Either I was wrong, and I can, but just need to find a pool that wants that tiny extra edge, or I am right, and you're just flapping your mouth.

But he (?) is speaking of traditional jobs that aren't simply part of the continuation of bitcoin. Things like hotels, grocery stores, or call centers.
Imagine if you were paid $7.25 + 7 mBTC ($0.80 the last time I checked) per hour, then as the price of bitcoin rises, you'd effectively be getting an automatic raise.
The $7.25 fiat gives you money for use that bitcoin doesn't service, like rent, and allows him to ensure you are always being paid more than minimum wage.

You can still connect to a lot of people by trusting Gateways like bitstamp. Then, if you want to sell a product online, they can pay you through Ripple without a prior connection.

Okay, I'll accept this challenge...
Bitcoiners should use both systems as a method of transferring BTC between multiple accounts with as few additions to the block chain as possible. This frees up space in the chain for transactions that can not be completed in Ripple, such as the transmission of actual money from one Gateway to another. Remember, the Gateways issue IOUs which are traded between Ripplers, so they regularly would be able to speak with each other and trade notes back to each other at a 1:1 ratio. Block chain transmissions would only need to occur if there is an imbalance at the end of their designated trading period.
Ripplers should use Bitcoin because the BTC is a decentralized currency, unlike the XRP, and while it is subject to certain risks, like every exchange, the value is considered more proven. XRP would be used as it was supposedly intended, as a facilitator for cross-currency trades.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:54:31
The biggest problem I am seeing with how we trade BTC is the fact that we value the coin **in terms of** the fiat currency. BTC is worth about $130, and not $1 is worth 7.69 mBTC.
I think this would provide an appropriate paradigm shift, while allowing newer adopters to enter in.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:41:42
Technically, it is possible that someone typed a wrong character into the karmabot, and it sent those funds to an address that didn't exist yet. The block chain would record the transaction, and it would wait until someone claimed it.

To be fair, there is quitting while you are ahead. If the price is truly artificially inflated because a handful of professional miners are hoarding coin, then they might realize that fact and cut out immediately. Of course, this would increase the liquidity of the coins themselves, allowing the rest of us to simply adjust to the new normal and continue.

Actually... I'm being one of those guys loaning USD right now. (I figure it'd be safer earnings, and I'd only lose if bitfinex totally fell apart.)
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:54:50
How does that even work? Wouldn't it eventually reach an upper limit of difficulty, even if that limit is ridiculously hard?
Wouldn't it be far better to instead have made the code to enforce the 3600 BTC rate by raising or lowering the block reward to how long a time it was between the past two blocks?
Plus, even if they only earned half the blocks, 1800 BTC/day, currently $200,000, is a lot of money to earn. If their concern is to destabilize what they see as a Western effort to remove monetary control from oppressive governments, they would be willing to pay a high price to do the one thing that hurts bitcoin the most... hoard it.
Imagine if they started collecting bit coin, not just from mining, but by purchasing it from investors, speculators, and other miners. They never sell, they never buy anything with it. It just rots in a bank of addresses, spread out so people don't realize how much they have. People see less fluidity in the BTC markets and so fight to cash out, accepting less and less for their investments, or simply abandon the coins as worthless themselves. China will have ultimately won, by having more people spending their regulated money, and the currencies of course tries that cater to them.
@_date: 2013-01-31 16:30:24
Of course, it could be a more isolated incident than we are seeing. After all, people don't normally post about successfully buying coins.

Still very sparse on the gift cards. Any way I can help you out on that? The pricing you put gives enough room to buy them at retail, and I have access to a huge selection of them, including prepaid credit cards, restaurant, gaming, and shopping.
Anyone who is interested in getting anything not offered by ForCoins can PM me for details. Obviously, the exchange rate would be given then.

Wrong. Liquidity is what increases the value of a currency, not hoarding. People must spend the money, including by means of purchase and investment, for the money to gain value.
If too many people hoard the money, it is worthless.

There is a possibility that they "found a high risk" because the price jumped during the process and they wanted to hold those coins to sell elsewhere.
Such a situation would be an indicator not only that they are unprincipled, but that they don't have a large amount of coins available.

Part of the problem I see with debit cards is that they will require the buyer to register them, if they are reloadable. It means extra paperwork and actually shipping out the card. Not ideal for the average person.
Reputation would be key. Among other things, I would be limiting the amount sold to a low dollar amount at first, to show that yes, I'll deliver in a timely manner and the codes are valid. After establishing that, I'd increase the amount I would trade at a time.
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:01:30
From what I understand, the new terms have to constitute a potentially valid agreement where you are not obviously trying to screw them over. Basically, if they are designed, like this guy's, in such a way that you can run up as high a bill as you want, and they would have to pay you if they ever closed the account for non-payment, the contract would be considered void.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:19:00
That only prevents the panic selling, not the single large transaction. In theory, the 111k BTC transaction on a single market, done as a limit order could put the price down, as they said above, to $35. It might be a different rate, if the "attack" came on a different exchange, and it certainly would be accompanied by a panic sell, but every one of those trades that occurs also means that people are buying.
Knowing that the price is artificially deflated, we can wait for the panic to start and buy coins between $3 and $35 each. The 111k owner might even count on that, and sell off down to $35, then buy back at $25, making a cool million in profit.

The number of coins created is the same, but it will be held by fewer people, which decreases the liquidity of the currency. See my other reply regarding liquidity.

The question is, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
With the prices falling, it will be easier to get BTC then a month ago, but it also means that the coin you are holding has less value.

Well, you are lucky, then. Most states have a sales tax, and it doesn't matter what currency is used, cash or credit.
You, living in Montana, is like using bitcoin without a transaction fee. It can be done, but it is generally more inconvenient, as it is away from major financial centers. Me, in Texas, is like paying a standard fee. The guys in New York are like paying a high transaction fee. As long as there is room on the ledger, we all get recorded. But the New Yorkers generally get thought of first.

If you are buying something in Europe that is insignificant in value, you don't need to report it. If you sell it later, you simply pay the taxes on the whole sale.
If you are buying something larger in Europe, like a car, or something that you intend to sell, the price would be fixed at the USD exchange rate at the time of purchase.
