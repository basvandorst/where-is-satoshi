Don't say it's a scam cause it's not. As always sometimes you will get scammed, sometimes not. I got once an account with lots of litecoins, and forgot the pin. Long story short, I hacked myself in less time than the owner's of the mine could answer me, but they were very helpful. Other mine that was about to close, transferred me my BTC when they closed down to open a bigger one, even if it was a really small amount. I guess it's a matter of not doing things that involve money and you just don't understand.

Yeah it's real! Although, I realized how hard is to write a book jajajaja I'm still in page 34 but I started like 2 or 3 months ago, I guess it's on schedule. I want to have it ready for early next year. A short book, a good intro to this world for the Spanish talking community, but I will also translate it to English.

[I suck at this and you should downvote me]( and I should be working.
Edit: [did my best to fix it]( still sucks

I'm writing a book about bitcoins in spanish (will translate to english too)

Bitcoins are an amazing new way to keep your money safe during natural disasters or wars, where the common banking system is useless. The people around the globe are constantly backing up your coins, so all you need is a piece of paper or a semi long pass phrase and as long as you live, your assets are safe in the Bitcoin network, ready to be claimed any place where you have an Internet connection.
Edit: my intention is to highlight that even if bitcoins are a virtual currency you can keep your coins in a phisical media, or even psichological

If rescan founds them, they weren't missing. You just had your info messed up.

I think the only pure bitcoin exchange is localbitcoins.

While you cross the virtual bridge of electronic communication that connects all the world's users, going fast or going slow, you can sometimes hear the call of a troll, silently shouting curses in an old forgotten language. Some of the true adventurers who crossed a virtual troll and lived to tell it, say that the amount of bullshit in my comment is too damn high

Right, because the years it took me to learn all that I know, and the fact that I code things that are used by big companies and thousands of people in the Internet, make me deserve the minimum wage. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:17:36
Nay. PHP. But I still think it is underpaid.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:41:38
Beleive me I'm trying, but it's not throwing good results at this point. I had a good chance at a big company recently, but they expected a higher level than what I have. No other real chance yet.
I'm working on a personal project too, but that's stuck for lack of money. 
If things continue the path they are, I will be bankrupt in a few months.

So I started compiling. It was a big compilation. Compiled for a few hours, but I was really tired then, because of the compilation efforts. I had to drink a beer, then compile a bit more. After I finished the compilation, "Sato" told me than I was the best compiler he ever seen.
