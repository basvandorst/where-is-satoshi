Funny.  And glad you shared.  I just finished reading an article in a major news publication and then read the comments re that article. 
Oh my.  
I have received push back for months on end within various quarters of cryptoland for advocating for content that explains in simple words, simple sentences, short paragraphs and with benefits explained in a meaningful way to the average Joe and Jill.  What you are saying further underscores what I have been advocating.  
There is a HUGE disconnect among "normies" re their understanding of all things crypto that troubles me. 
Why is this important?  Because those with legislative power respond when millions of their constituents rise up in support of something being squashed or highly restricted. Without that active and loud support, those with power can exercise it in a manner that crypto supporters, a number still slim, may find upsetting.  
I'm a former PR agency head and faculty member who has lived long enough to evolve from that into front-end dev, managing my own local server, and learning/tinkering with code anytime I have the opp.  
What I know is that you most certainly can lure people into reading content dealing with this highly technical arena if it does not read like a scholarly article and answers the reader's question of "what's in this for me"...why should I trade my time to read this? 
I remember long ago dealing with this very issue in the sciences at a university, where I wanted to write about advances in monoclonal antibodies.  After a considerable amount of persuasion, scientists finally began working with me to popularize their research.  The result?  Donations increased.  Why? Because people "got it."  It's not a complicated approach.
We need this.  I have no idea how to make it happen.  But every bone in my body says it needs to happen.

I'm not a holder, except with a small percentage of coins from profit which if I lose all it's fine, but that said, I see this as a buy opp.  I do not hold because I consider that gambling in this arena. So please know that not all of us are get rich quick types...I prefer instead to have 100% successful trades...and I do.

60 minutes / 1 block every 5 minutes = 12 blocks per hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:25:54
Because it takes hours for tx and the fees are absurd
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:29
The high fee approach works if more value is being provided but when a non-techy / non-crypto edu'd person has to choose between coin transfers or payments with coins, surely you don't think the tx time and fee result in them choosing something else that does the same thing, faster and cheaper?

Terrible seems too weak a response.  I feel for you and support you in action you take.  How about contacting all the online pubs, also?  Share a link to this to their news tips.    If everyone shared this on social media, we could reduce number of users of Localbitcoin -- the market needs to help stop this by not supporting them.  I have tweeted this.  Join me?

Because in the US, buying anything with crypto is a taxable event using basis and time of hold from buy date to determine applicable tax rate.

Do you mind a suggestion?  Before you begin trading and/or being bombarded with TA, hodl, etc. etc., grab a cup of your fav drink and watch QuickFinger Lucs youtube videos ( if OK to post?  url is  [  )   He teaches two approaches that you can safely -- and I do truly mean safely -- use to steadily build your account.  He's an easy listen.  He's not hyping or selling anything anything.  He's just this really cool guy who likes to help people.  He's making his living from trading.  There's a discord where a bunch of us hang out at and he visits periodically there, if you are looking for like-minded souls.  Step one:  No one sells crystal balls, not even Jeff Bezos.  Step two:  emotions -- control them or learn how to.   Welcome aboard!!!  I used to trade commodities, have always traded equities.  Started in this world in 2017.   Luc is spot on if you really can hunker down and listen carefully..  I can't even remember when I lost a crypto trade.   Oh.. yeah..   go online and tab the "compound daily calculator"    If you use that and set it at 2% every other day, look at what happens over a year.  That tool itself is a reason for patience and not being greedy.   Anyway..  gotta go.  Luck to you!!!!!!

@_date: 2018-03-10 17:41:03
I live in snowbelt up north and have wanted solar but every time I pencil it out, the ROI isn't there -- it takes decades before the debt when I do the calculations.  We have hydro here so elect cost is one of the lowest in nation.  What did you do to get cost-effective solar?  I'd love to learn which coin is best to mine and if I can upgrade an old desktop tower I have hanging around here to dedicate to that task.

My argument with speculation is that 9 out of 10 businesses fail within the first 10 years, lower number but still high during first three years.  And yet we invest in them without anyone yapping.

Well, dox away.  I believe holding is gambling -- unless you have magic ball that you are secretly holding for yourself.  I use, though, a small percentage of gains for selective holds.  If they win, fine.  If they lose, no problem.  It was a gift.  The bulk I position trade on -- buying dips, but not all dips, only the dips with certain characteristics.  I layer sell the first time those dips turn green.  Rinse, repeat.  A percentage each week of gains into savings.  Move into USDT or USD when BTC fall will affect my gains.  Try to stay in USDT or USD as much as possible.  That's my way and it works for me.  I have been growing my wad consistently, during the up and particularly during the downs.

I'm a position and day trader curently.  It's been so good to me that I'm doing only those two tasks daily, as in my job. However, I'm thinking that this will only last until the US federal and/or state governments shut it down.  In their minds, we need to be protected, their loss of control over monetary policy will not be tolerated, their need to track financial evil is threatened by blockchain currency.

While in an ideal world, that would be achievable, in a world of humans, people's perceptions, which result in attitudes and then opinions and behavior, are and always have been affected by those in a circle of people we call "influentials."  Dimon has a podium.  He has reach.  And he, despite the corporate and personal negatives, has influence.  The day after his statement, his company bought BTC.  I'm all for diversity in and freedom of speech but what I perceived when hearing him was that he was expressing the threat financial institutions and governments are exploring from digital currencies and, then, the benefit his company could experience from a dip buy. That latter was the most troubling.

Strategic PR programs are designed for companies and nonprofits at all stages of maturity.  There is a saying in the field that brains do not like a vacuum and will always fill with information.  If you do not communicate, it will fill with whatever info is available and currently negative far outnumbers positive.  The issue is not funding round.  PR target audiences include more than just consumers/buyers, which is why it's called Public Relations.  It targets all of the various publics.   Public Relations is *not* media relations or publicity.  That's only one of its tools.

Nibble on the way down.  No one call tell you what the bottom really is.  I look for bases.  If a base cracks, then more panic selling will occur by the inexperienced.  That will push it down to the next base, upon which it can then bounce or break.  No one know what news will happen this afternoon, tomorrow or next week that can change the direction.  You can take calculated positions, though. Weekends usually experience a decrease in vol/price so that's a pattern to keep in mind.  As it's 24-hour exchange, day trades are dif than evening.   The only important decision you must make is to buy low and sell at a profit.  If you don't buy the lowest price, who cares as long as you make a profit?  And I assure you, no one can tell you where the bottom is... it's guessing....so do little nibbles as it falls that way you'll be in the game ... while watching previous bases..

Are you in the U.S.?  If so, I used USD on Coinbase to buy BTC and then sent it over to GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase, provides more services and does not charge for limit orders.  Given your question, I have a sense you have never invested personally (without a financial planner) in equities.  So you need to decide if you are going to trade or simply buy, hold and ignore.  If it's the former, you'll need to learn more than doing the latter.  I do position trading which is dif from day trading.  I know I could not do that without having learned. For me, volatility is great.  At the very least, I suggest you do some reading to understand what story the charts are trying to tell you, what limit vs market vs stop orders are, and the sources of info in the crypto world.  It's a great learning experience!

Yet another example of how this space desperately needs a communication expert that can focus on explaining the technology in a manner that nontechnical folks not only easily and quickly understand but can get excited by the benefits.  I have heard "I do not understand" far more than I have heard "I get it."  Importance?  Liquidity. Governmental response to widespread public support.  Increase adoption and use.  Favorable coverage on mainstream media. ... and more..

I find it rather uppity, condescending of you to state that people who do not understand are, using your coarse term: "retards."  There are many nurses, doctors, politicians, farmers, electricians, writers, homemakers and more whose focus is on their careers and family and do not understand cryptocurrency or blockchain.  To say that some vague "we" does not need these people is a philosophy that alienates and hampers adoption.  And hoo-rah (yes, not hurrah) that you have been blessed with a mind that quickly grasps databases and algorithms.  You sound snobbish to me.  That's not helpful.   
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:02:09
Agree...and first we need to explain digital coins and ledgers-on-steroids with simple English so that the vast majority of people, of all walks of life and education, understand it.  I would be very wealthy if I rec'd $1 for every time I have been told or heard "I do not understand cryptocurrency."  Blockchain?  That word isn't in most people's vocabulary.  We're at the edge of the early adopter phase, imho, and the next stage that is sorely needed is to make it meaningful and understandable to all.  I would love to find a way to start that process happening.  I guess it's my past years spent as a founder/head of a PR/Marcom agency and work in the science, tech, ag, and animal fields that has me biting at the chomp.

Thanks for someone saying it's a daytrader's dream.  I've been feeling a mixed bag of feelings as I'm one of those traders and I'm doing just fine, waking up with excitement.  I have said before and will say it again - holding is gambling.

I use it.  They maintain lists -- cryptocurrency buyers, website devs, full-stack devs, people who own large companies in the small biz space  You choose list you believe you match.  You agree to receive email from those who want to reach those on the list.  They pay to send to the list. You get paid in BTC/USD.  I've had no issues there and the one time I needed support, I had it quickly and was served well.  &lt;not part of their team in any way&gt; I was dubious intially also. I use it to build some BTC, slowly but it takes me just some dust of time.

Authy has been really helpful ...told me that Google Store is removing Authy because of so many problems with it in Chrome.  Hated hearing that but at least it left me feeling sane.  I work online all day every day and nothing I've ever done in custom full-stack work has ever been this onerous!!! So worried I am going to lose my money... 
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:01:29
I read your guide.  Nice job.  Helpful.  
I want to do this but I'm stuck.   I have Authy Chrome Extension as my Coinbase/GDax 2FA.  It's not set to multi-device.  It's used on Win7 64 desktop. 
When I enter Master Password into Chrome Authy Extension, it hangs, searching for password.  I know the pwd is correct as I save unique pwd's in a secured Passpack. 
Authy recommends doing a reset of Authy which apparently will delete the token.  
I would have done that but I've read that others have then not been able to access their Coinbase/Gdax accounts afterwards and support does not reply. 
My understanding was that after token removal, SMS should be restored on Coinbase, enabling use of another desktop authenticator. I don't want it on my phone. 
What I'd prefer is to remove Authy association with my account and download what I have in GDax to an external wallet, just as you have suggested. 
Getting a bit anxious a the July 31 date is approaching and I've already spent a week trying to figure out how to do this properly.
Reaching out to you to see if you have any advice or can refer me to someone.  :-)  hoping..
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:13:47
While I do not want it on my phone, I did try.  I cannot.  Doing the install on the phone required that I change the default in Authy Chrome Extension to multi-device.  I did not want it on any other device so I did not enable that. Thanks for reaching out.  I'm feeling rather alone and grry right now.  This shouldn't be so time-consuming or so complicated.

I have only gained through the bear and bull markets.   It's slow and steady and not as exciting as some may want it to be.   But reactive trading is a simple way to make money in any market stage.   It can bore you to tears though!  I refer friends and family to Quic Luc's youtube videos .. he does a great job of simply explaining.   He makes his living off it too...
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:21:12
Which is why reactive traders win, hands down.   Good grief.  No one can tell the future.  You only know the past and now.  Period.   A/B and position trading builds small portfolios quickly and safely.  Two years of trading here and I only go up.   But then again, I was trading for decades long before crypto.  No TA, holding, shorting, longs for me.  Just steady gains.

go look at quic luc's trading vids on youtube.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, given the words you write here.  I refuse to hold, too, until the moment I have a crystal ball.
