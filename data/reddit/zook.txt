I'm not a part of them but I'm going to recommend the [Child's Play charity]( I'll send them off a link to this post to see if they will apply. I've been using them for years and even have them setup on my Smile Amazon account.
Edit: They said they just filled out the application.

If this is an actual offer than I would be interested in reviewing the source code.

I read two months from now I think. I'm not sure though. I have my order placed for the mobile 4GB version right now.
Can anyone confirm a date? I'm on my phone right now heh.
@_date: 2013-07-10 21:39:37
They should still be reported though.

The biggest thing that sucks is I'm trying to get the company I work for to accept bitcoins. The problem is were super small, and having to pay $300 a month to have QuickBooks integration would be an automatic no from the boss.

Also you better start now on writing your own compiler.

How much polishing are we talking? I'm not too experienced in QuickBooks but I never object to learning. We have two stores right now with an employee base of 8 employees so it all comes down to a plan of how I would tell my boss that we handle importing the items in to QuickBooks.
Basically I would have to propose a quick lesson to all 8 employees (which includes the two owners) on how to do it and hope that its simple enough for them to accept it..

I'm hoping that each of these accounts were posted to @_date: 2013-04-03 22:14:33

Wow. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:19:06
So how much have you mined so far?
@_date: 2013-07-01 06:18:57
I honestly think I could make it work.  It would require myself to be very frugal and live with a roommate... But, I think it would be possible.

2 day old account trying to give out a 3 million dollar tip.
Sounds legit.

All the Terms of Service say is:


@_date: 2013-04-12 13:56:53
After you send a photo copy of every identification card that your entire family holds accompanied with their Social Security Cards.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:38:13
You have to have a credit card though as it will reject all debit cards.

Appreciate your kindness.  A great message to see after I get off work.
@_date: 2013-05-24 07:25:47
I would honestly hire a lawyer to help you write out the terms of service.  You're dealing with peoples personal phone numbers and money at the same time (0.01 BTC = 1.21 USD as of this message).

Surprised no one noticed that the url kind of looks like it's saying "Ez Pwn".

SpaceX would be a great organization also.  I'm down for anything as long as we actually do it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:41:26
Try opening that in your client.  Import wallet. Because that's a wallet file that holds bitcoins heh.

I would love to have a custom debit card from them with a nice Bitcoin label on it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:06:20
At the moment I'm not sure to be honest. We would be accepting the coins in store and online. Deal completely with every console released, their entire libraries, then board games, and all popular trading card games. 
I'm not sure what other merchants deal with a catalog like ours so I can't really even estimate how many sales we could have.
As for the credit card thing, that was the starting talk I made with my boss along with the potential to have customers having an extra payment option.
He said that he was pretty interested but I'm at a loss right now with how to go farther with this.

Just in case you can't access the website:

1.  Sign up for a random email address at Gmail
2.  Have your random email address set up to forward all messages to your "[e-mail]( for your phone.
3.  Sign up for the service with your random email address.

I actually sent them a resume when they first did their wave of hiring. It was for a position to help out on social media outlets. 
Never got a response from them at all but I do hope for the best with them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:59:37
Heh, wasn't tip fishing at all to be honest.  Was just extremely bored before work.  
Just got off and saw all these messages though.  Wanted to say thank you for your kindness.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:20:44
How much did it cost to setup that?
About how much do you make a day? A month?
How much are you paying for electricity with this rig?

The first thing I would do is run a system wide search for "wallet*" or "*wallet*". 
Wildcards are always nice. 
Anyways, you can try to brute force it but I don't think it will matter. Especially if you were smart with your password.
