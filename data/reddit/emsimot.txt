Vitalik, I've never understood how you find the time to reddit with all the work you do.

123 fake St?

But why say anything at all if not to communicate something?

I watched a bunch of his interviews and I actually really liked them. To each their own I suppose.

This post will likely be removed shortly. It looks like the mods are removing anything related to the Ethereum presale at the moment.

If there was a fiverr-like website that was built for bitcoin use only, and say, I was building it... What kind of features would you guys like to see?

Something I'd really like to see is public wifi that is paid for with a Bitcoin micropayment channel. I've tried to work out how to do it myself but I just don't have the skills... Yet!

Perhaps they think the fee adequately pays for the number of fraudulent transactions?

This is fascinating. How many of you are working on the project?
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:45:20
Yes, attempted murder.

I'd love to be involved, could I get a beta invite?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:36:51
Would you be willing to use a warrant canary?

IIRC sending to IP has been disabled.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:27:03
Wow, thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:37:09
Why is that?
@_date: 2014-06-23 05:43:25
This is very similar to a project I am working on. I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on it ;)
Just quickly, Is the site designed for mobile? It looks very strange in chrome.
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:18:27
That sounds fantastic. If bitcoin goes to the moon I'll hit you up :)

This is the reason I'm hoping for DigitalOcean to accept bitcoin rather than move to chunkhost. After using DO for a while now I don't think I can go back to monthly charges, I create and destroy different kinds of droplets all the time.
