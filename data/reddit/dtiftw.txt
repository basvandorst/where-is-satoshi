Do you know what jumped the shark means? How does it apply here?
And are you disputing that you brought up Facebook?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:09:51
I'm gonna let you think about the statement you just made. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:20:51
And you're a random person. Who clearly has an emotional investment in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:14:21


No, you think that referencing network effects somehow makes Bitcoin invulnerable. 
You're the one who brought up social networks, kid. Remember? You're just too young to remember that Myspace was Facebook. Up until the point that a better alternative came along. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:56:59
Bitcoin is more secure because its larger. If people go to an altcoin en masse, it will become larger and thus more secure. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:39


The rallying cry of disagreement around here. 


Facebook has value because it can deliver ads to consumers. The network accomplishes something. If Facebook loses all of its users, the network is worthless. 
If everyone stops using bitcoin, the network is useless.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:50:32
If the only reasonable place to store gold is buried in your back yard, you'd have a point. But unlike bitcoin, that's not the only option.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:16:52


The CEO of Myspace disagrees. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:33:40
They knew? You have proof of this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:55:55
So big families who need three are out of luck?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:49:07
Maybe because you ignored them in favor of creating your own definition specifically to make bitcoin look good. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:01
Oh, kid. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why you don't just cut and paste names. 


Of course. Because you can't actually discuss this topic with someone who has read things you haven't. 


Obviously. You haven't read him, and you got caught out on that by someone who has. 


Wait. Are we talking about your comments?


Going for Taleb again? Makes it pretty clear you've only read Taleb's interpretations of actual economics. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:42:14


Or maybe bitcoin is experiencing a bubble. Since it's particularly volatile, it seems like it has no business being the standard by which to judge actual currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:25:20
I like how you assume companies won't act rationally and will act smartly in the same breath. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:29


And you took Econ 101 but didn't go any farther. 


Never said it was. But organizations are actors themselves. 


It didn't "prove" any such thing. Behavioral econ has created a different framework for choice that adds to the rational actor theory. It only proves rational choice wrong if you have a simplistic view of both. 


You're not one to lecture people on learning something. There's life after Econ 101. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:25:22


You need to demonstrate that financial innovation is used to orchestrate financial crises. 
How do you plan to do that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:56:47
Oh no. You think Taleb knows what he's talking about. That explains a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:59
I'll listen to actual economists on the topic. Not someone who selectively chooses which ones are valid. While mocking the field altogether. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:45
I have read their work. Since you clearly haven't, I found a simple summary for you. 
I'm sorry they don't wildly oversimplify concepts they don't understand like Taleb does. That's no excuse for you to keep posturing like you understand them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:23:58
No, if you don't let the price go up, the first people in line will buy it all and not the people who need it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:35


Sure. You're a mature adult who has actually read the people they cite. 


Sure thing. If you don't, you'll be forced into a discussion with someone who has actually read source material. Not just the ramblings of Nassim Taleb. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:26:37


You keep doing that. You shouldn't. Why should we consider bitcoin as the reference point instead of the other way around?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:27:52

@_date: 2018-10-31 15:43:43

Aside from appointing and confirming the Board of Governors, who actually run it. 


Right. Nothing to do with the fact that the law creating the Fed was, you know, a law passed by the government. 
It isn't directly controlled by the government, that's true. But it was created by the government and is run by governmental appointees. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:26:45
Right. All of that is straight from Congress. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:58:16
The site with no sources?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:18:13


No, it isn't. 


Because it's nonsense. Of course the Board of Governors has a lot of people from big banks. Because it is itself a big bank and you kind of want someone with experience in banking to run a bank. And the shares in the Reserve Bank are not the same as ownership shares in a company.

No, it really isn't. It's the implementation that's fraudulent as we've seen from numerous altcoins. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:25:29


It means the implementation is fraudulent.


Except for the ones that were overtly scams. 


Patently absurd. Technology itself can be just fine even if it's used for nefarious purposes.
Then again, I should know better to expect rationality from people with fanboy usernames.

Too bad VISA on its own can process [56,000]( per second. 


Uh, I was responding to someone who doesn't understand that blockchains are vastly less efficient than current systems. And if you don't think that efficiency is a problem, then you don't understand the issue.
Efficiency is the bottom line. No major processing company is going to adopt a more expensive and slower system. They might integrate certain parts of blockchain technology but they aren't using it as the backbone of their business anytime soon.

You should be. Because that's the only way that contamination is accidental.

@_date: 2017-05-23 02:37:52
He tried to have people murdered. 
Why do people keep thinking that has nothing to do with the sentence? The prosecutor got him sentenced to life in prison. They did that without having to do more work to prove to a jury that he tried to have people murdered. 
But he did, and he's paying the price. The world isn't a vacuum and this is the dumbest possible place to try and make some kind of point about drug laws.

Yes, people accused of things are the best source.


I am so happy you just google things without doing any actual research. Because in that suit, [do you want to know what OSGATA's counsel admitted in open court](


 


There are two options here. Either you're right or one of the best-funded lawsuits against Monsanto knew less than you.
What do you think is more likely?
It has never happened. Not once, not ever. The Organic industry admitted it never happened before a judge.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:08:55


Which isn't what happened. 
He was going away for life. Because he created and managed a criminal empire, RICO did that. People here keep trying to make it out like he was just some poor guy who got caught up in the world. He isn't. He's a bad dude. 
The fact that he tried to have people killed gives us context as to the rest of his business. He can't play the victim card when he's willing to buy the murder of someone. 
Within that framework, the sentence imposed because of the other charges is just. On their own they are just, if people here weren't so willing to ignore laws they don't like. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:52:57
They didn't need the attempted murder charges. RICO was enough. Doesn't mean the evidence wasn't there. The chat logs are public. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:53:09
The law is free to learn about. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:17:53










Because that's enough to put him away. Why work harder than you have to? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:41:36


He's only a martyr to burnouts and conspiracy theorists. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:17:22

@_date: 2017-05-23 01:59:39


For trying to have people murdered? Not really. 
They got the sentence he deserved without having to try more avenues of the case. RICO sent him away. They didn't have to waste time on the other charges. Had RICO not been able to send him away, he would be convicted of attempted murder. 
This isn't fluid or debatable except to people who want to make him out to be a hero. He isn't a hero. He's a drug dealer who tried to have people murdered so he could keep getting rich. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:34:09

@_date: 2017-05-23 00:52:01

No, not hence. That's not what fall guy means. 
He did the things he was convicted of. Evidence points to him doing the things he was accused of, to.

He's in jail for good. I'm satisfied. 
It's just people here who want to pretend he's not a scumbag.

If not, why do you think this in any way makes the situation better?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:25:25

@_date: 2017-05-23 00:42:43
Are you disputing it happened? Because he isn't. 
But let's play this game. 
Why does being proven in court matter? If he was convicted, the people here would say it's just another conspiracy. Like him being the "fall guy". 
No amount of evidence is good enough for conspiracists, zealots, and nutjobs. This particular topic attracts all three. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:48:00


If only he hadn't made that tiny mistake of trying to have someone murdered. 
I mean, who of us hasn't hired a hitman?

You want to be involved in a discussion, you could at least contribute a tiny bit. 
RICO is the entire reason why they didn't need to prosecute other crimes. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:01:01


Yep. Because I haven't. 
Nothing you have done here indicates you will even consider changing your mind. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:33:45
It really, really isn't. What would be the functional change if a third life sentence is tacked on?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:20:26
The best part about your smug refusal to accept reality is that you are forced to assume that other people aren't as smart as you. Or haven't done the research. 
You believing nonsense doesn't make you better informed. Just more gullible. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:55:16
Open minded to actual evidence? Sure. 
Not your brand of conspiratorial garbage. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:05:28


He did it. The records exist. People are in this thread, right now, arguing he didn't do the other things he was proven to do. 
No amount of evidence is enough for conspiracists, zealots, and nutjobs. The people you're playing devil's advocate for are some combination of those.

Yeah, the government must have forged the chat logs then never used them for anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:34:50
Ever hear of Poe's Law?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:06:21
He did both. The evidence exists that he did both.
If you won't be bothered to learn about RICO, then you aren't going to get anywhere with people who actually understand the law.

Sure you would. Which is why you're clinging to every wild theory out there that shows he's not a bad guy. 
You believe the government framed him without any proof at all. 
So your bar for "real evidence" appears to depend on whether or not you want to believe something. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:54:02
One of its thinks they know better than the actual prosecutor on the case. 
Who is self absorbed in that situation?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:19:30
Instead of being done, try reading a few more sentences. That you won't says a lot about you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:28:34
Encrypted chat logs. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:28:31
Yes, prosecutors drop charges all the time. It's less work to convict someone on fewer charges since there's less evidence and motive to prove. 
People need to stop thinking they understand things without bothering to learn about them.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:57:06


No, you're inventing ridiculous hypotheticals instead of following the actual discussion.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:51:13


Oh good grief. 
Disinformation isn't needed when we have people willingly spreading nonsense.
