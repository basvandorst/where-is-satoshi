I remember losing around $700aud in a massive short liquidation when bitmex had a "crash" because wherever they got their data had a hiccup. I'm either paranoid or they're still massive scammers.

Cashapp is probably your best option.
Why are you trying to send and receive btc before learning how to do so? That's a great way to make a mistake and lose your money.

Not with the new fees it's not.
Its just as easy to get set up with gemeni or kraken.

This this this! Find a real person you can trust to help because without some research you might not know what you're looking for or what to even do with it.
There are lots of people on the internet who just want to gain from your loss so be careful.

Did you even bother looking through the dozens of posts of this exact question?

Not sure what you mean. It pretty much operates like a shopping centre food court.

From the exposure draft:
- 1.23 While digital currency is included in the definition of cash, 
given ways in which digital currency is presently used in Australia, it is 
expected that the Treasurer will exempt most transactions involving 
digital currency for the cash payment limit.

In the very video you linked it is said crypto is excluded. The ban is for use of physical cash for transactions over 10k. The ban only applies to government issues currencies. They dont want to touch the crypto market because they know how much is invested in it.

Ignore this. The ban EXCLUDES crypto.
