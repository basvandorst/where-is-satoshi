You're just a twat living in your small world. Plenty of people were using bitcoin for payments, adoption is growing every day. Sadly BTC can't keep up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:15:07


That's not true. You can check this threads comments.


Asicboost does not produce empty blocks. If you think it does, can you link proof?


First of all, there is no mention of RBF in the whitepaper. Second, transactions are lighter without SegWit, not heavier. SegWit just removes some data from the blockchain. Malleability in bitcoin cash is already fixed, you can use LN without segwit without any problems whatsoever.
Guys, this one is pure bullshit, be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:35
practically, open a channel with a big hub (a bank most likely), and spend money through them
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:22:52
Because its usable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:55
LN hubs will be centralized. It is by design.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:33
Not a native speaker. I guess hasn't, in a sense that it can keep up, but refuses to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:12
How does asicboost impact scaling? It doesn't, it's just asic stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:33
It's unnecessary for BCH. How does it make it more usable?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:46
Bch already did atomic swaps with Komodo. Lightning Network needs malleability fix, not segwit. There are many ways to fix malleability. AsicBoost is hugely irrelevant in the scaling debate and is just used as a talking point against it. 
Also, what exactly is wrong with asicboost? I don't really know much about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:54
The occurance and size of mempool spikes are more common and bigger each time it comes. Check  All the evidence suggests mempool only going up long-term, unless something in BTC is changed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:52
You can argue that segwit is not needed for scaling.
What other improvements am I missing since the fork?


BCH is maintained by 3 different developer groups. Contrary to what you said, it is better in this regard than most coins, including BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:26
BCH does not need to scale to millions of tx's per second RIGHT NOW. It has to scale just enough to keep the growth going. It will not suddenly become centralized, unlike LN, the hubs will definitely be centralized and its by design.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:44
It implies that BCH is technologically inferior, although it is the same code (as people here like to tell, that it is just copied code), with bigger blocks. I wouldn't call that a badly built bus.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:40
They are incentivized to join a bigger hub, to have less hops to pay their target, so in general they will be joining bigger hubs, not the small one. Small isps is different, you dont have a choice as a resident. In bitcoin, you can pick any hub you like, there is no location restriction, is it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:49
It's centralized in a sense that if you want to be a hub, you have to have enough money put it to move it around through lots of channels. If you have only a couple channels open, you're not much of a hub, are you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:40
Then those who don't use a hub, will not be able to practically use LN.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:44:27
Centralization of hubs will allow them to essentially control the fees. It is possible that all the hubs will be owned by one entity, be it an alliance or a pool, which can create a monopoly and completely avoid the free market. For example, you want to send bitcoin from USA to China, you have your channel open with HubUSA, which has a channel to HubChina. You pay a fee of 0.1$ for a LN transfer. It seems good enough, fast and not so expensive tx. But what if its a monopoly and the fee is 10$, you have three options: send it for 10$, open another channel, do an on-chain tx. Fees for onchain and channel is the same, and it will never be cheaper than a LN tx, but you have no other option if you want to use your bitcoins, but to pay big fees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:27:57
What about moving coins on-chain? How much that costs?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:31
Creating a useful hub will require capital, you are freezing your btc for channels. Avoiding LN will inquire fees on the main chain, which I guess I cannot predict how much will cost when LN is ready. If LN fails, then bitcoin is stuck without any scaling improvements since 2013? How is that not a threat?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:08
Most Bitcoin Cash supporters gather in r/btc. It has a long history of supporting bigger blocks, that's why naturally all the people who support BCH use it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:01:24
Darn, I must've mistaken some article. Sorry about it, disregard that statement.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:08
If you follow only the guys you like, you only see one side of things - how your followed people like it. In the case of OP's post, its like 75% of Bitcoin Core devs/speakers, 0% of Bitcoin Cash devs/speakers. You can't form a strong opinion while getting only one-sided information.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:21:55
Tldr: lots of baseless information, only babble without any links, any new readers be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:59:27
How is it an exploit? Its an improvement to efficiency, what is it exploiting?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:26


Can you be more specific?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:24:35
why the fuck would I even want to do that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:30
You call it bcash though, and we know the reason why. r/btc was already subbed by like-minded people, long before bitcoin cash was created. Naturally, they are discussing about the same coin they supported for nearly 3 years. This should not surprise you. Also r/bitcoincash is growing little by little, so thats nice.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:10:42


The main dev has opened champagne when the fees overcame block reward, this is what the devs wanted, dude....
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:36:00
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:01
The only reason BCH was created was to increase blocksize cap to 8MB. Don't trust the OP, do your own research.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:46
If you want to learn more, be sure to research both coins on their own subreddits. Some people here mentioned some folks hate when you call it Bcash, the actual reason is r/bcash is moderated by the same folks who moderate this place, and its a conflict of interest. No Bitcoin Cash supporter visits r/bcash. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:28:38
You have no idea what forking means. Monero forks every 6months and its one of the most stable coins.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:53:30




And my internet is 300/300, is unliminted, and costs 15$ a month. I would have no problems running any node. And its not just me, just like you have your case, there are as many people having great and cheap internet without any stupid caps. If you can't run a node, there are people who can, and you should not stiffle innovation. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:35:24
Miners will not include zero fee tx.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:19:00
Its greater by a whooping 0.004%? Amazing
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:51:40
So if it's okay with you, bitcoin loses one of its possible purposes - general spending.
You don't expect general use would make it easier for these charts than these "attacks"?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:10:17
How do big blocks destroy decentralization? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:51:21


If you can't argue that it's a spam attack, you shouldn't have even mentioned it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:44:12
So, you mean just have bigger blocks? That will solve all the things you mentioned.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:44:46
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:11:20
Right now the fee is 0.011$ for 1kB. Lets say you want to store one song and it is a 3MB .mp3 file. It will cost you 30$ in fees. How is this feasible for any storage?
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:57:38
It's the average price for 1GB, it keeps decreasing each year. Same with internet bandwitch speeds, processing power. The 1mb block size is suffocating the network without any reason. With 2mb blocks you would have a clean mempool and a more capable network. This 1mb limit was setup on July 2010, isn't it's time to increase it after 7years? Or do you think all the other tech stagnated the same?
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:13:16
And combine with practically zero fees, that's groundbreaking.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:25:49
5$ is a normal fee? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:23:08
Yeah bch currently has 0,002% more coins.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:36:07
Segwit does not increase block size
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:45:46
Thanks, I'll check it out soon.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:18:54


But it's not revolutionary or groundbreaking, having practically nonexistant fees are groundbreaking.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:18:44
Oh they are always mining and its even more balanced than ever, check the link out yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:32:24
Miners seek profit, that's all there is now and all the time bitcoin was alive. That's the foundation bitcoin is built on.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:20:02
Defending from who? General use cases?
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:50:29
The data storage use case is impossible to be feasible in this network. Google or any other service would not host any of the data in this blockchain, because even with bch fees it is too expensive. 
Why do you consider the usage of dice as spam? I mean, if general usage for bitcoin shoots up, if people are buying groceries, are you going to label it as spam too? If the fees are low enough to use it, you use it. If it's too high, you don't use it. Right now btc is unusable for anything, but it could be used everywhere, even to host google data, and why would that be wrong? You pay your fee, how can you consider it as spam? There is a tip bot in rbtc, do you consider it as spam too?
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:39:10
The bch chain in total has a minimal difference compared to btc chain, they have a similar amount of coins. You can see coinmarketcap.com. In the last week ir so, yes, bch produced more coins, but in a broader sense, it doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:43:59
Average block time is better for bch, though. Look at the week averages.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:23:44
People lost money because of FOMO not because of him, get real.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:03:00
Bitcoin Cash has a better chance to be used as a store of value than bitcoin, so yeah.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:30:55
And millions of those people still hold bch, so it does not make a difference if they lose their btc value to bch value.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:01:46
What are you talking about, btc is finding blocks more faster than bch. I just gave you a link where you can find it yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:04:59
At the time it reaches 1GB blocks my 2 TB hard drive will be in the bin. I can get 1 gb/s unlimited internet for cheap right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:00
Right now LN theoretically scales worse than bitcoin, it would need more data to be sent through LN nodes, which would lead to centralization. This problem is not solved at all, you can test all you want, but on a big scale you will not be able to have cheap LN nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:39:09
You can use Bitcoin Cash right now, which has and will have lower fees for a long time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:21:34
widely held where? r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:55:27
What I have is what you will have in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:50:58
Cheap and fast transactions
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:02:30
That scale is unreachable now without a datacenter. What tech we will have when we reach that amount, you and I don't know. Right now 1mb blocks are ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:56:55
You can't right now, just like you can't use lightning network. We'll see how it goes on the next year. I think bch can do it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:38:11
Core does not want to scale on-chain, how does that matter?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:27
If its 137 tx/block you're looking at 5480tx per hour, because we have a rate of 40blocks/hour, compared to btc  2324 tx/block and  1.33 blocks/hr we are looking at 5414tx/hour. Looks like the same usage to me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:26:16
You mean Bitcoin Segwit together with Core will be a failed experiment? If BCH surpasses BTC, you can just say it's the better version. An upgrade to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:55:39
You make it sound like no development is going on the bch chain. By the time it reaches 8mb blocks it will have tech for easier block propagation. If all goes well, it will take less bandwidth than propagating current 1mb blocks. How's that for scaling?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:39:01
So why aint everyone doing it then if you can get a few billion of dollars? There is no consensus for it. That's why Bitcoin Cash is still going, because it has enough consensus for it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:03:07
Think for yourself, how is 8mb block big? Study more.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:17:30


Can you specify which ideas?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:20:22
Obviously that is not happening right now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:22
You should do the maths yourself regarding verifying, it will not be a problem for anyone to verify full 8mb blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:38:25
BCH tx inrease is there, look at my reply to the poster above.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:48:47
All of the payment systems? Haha, ok, so how do you use bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:22:50
1 super computer can virtualise as many nodes as it's capable of, and it sure as hell aint 1
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:41:14
Pretty much
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:57:00
What do you mean? To do LN transactoons you still have to use bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:09:45
Do you know how cheap and easy it is to setup any number of nodes? How can you count consensus from it if it has this fatal flaw.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:35:57
Oh, sorry, I just averaged the block size, didn't want to type 1.05mb blocks. My mistake.
They are doing what they think are best for bitcoin, which does not align with your view. Why would they destroy the system, if they are doing business in it?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:33:12
They agree with segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:25:07
Keep it in the cloud, encrypted, with a unique password.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:51:25
I am just saying, for others, how do you expect this business to support 1mb blocks, when it is not sustainable for them? Why are you even angry at them?
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:05:32
You are implying that exchanges will list sw2x as anything other than BTC. Good luck with that!
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:11:59
Maybe these companies are fighting against centralisation of software (bitcoin core) and they think its gonna kill bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:45:17
I can see that, though emotions should have no place here. 
That's a cruel comparison. What nestle is doing is unethical and immoral. What bitpay is doing is in no way comparable to nestle. However, I do agree with what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:55:43
And for it to go through, you pick one thing - cheap or fast. No matter what you do its a problem of the network, not what I do or do not.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:26:03
SegWit has other baggage with it, so it may not suit their needs.
It took 3 years to go from 100kb blocks to 1mb blocks, do you expect to get consistent 4mb blocks overnight? Also, you are assuming 100% SegWit usage, which will not be happening any time soon (right now its like 5% yeah?), even with that it will be 3.4mb blocks, to be precise. 
BitPay would not compete because of high usage fees. Do you know who will pay those fees? Users. If you want to use bitcoin, you will have to pay those fees, and it does not matter which company you use, BitPay or any other payment processor, the fees will still be there. SegWit2x at least gives us a longer time without fees, unlike now. I think you are overblowing all the requirements to run bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:56:16
That does not matter for on-chain fees, does it?
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:54:08
Do you know there are other types of nodes, not only Bitcoin Core? Or you like this centralisation of nodes, node=btc core?
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:39:01
Do you all understand that BitPay cannot do business with these 1mb blocks? If the mempool fills up, fees increases and suddenly accepting bitcoin becomes a problem for them. Just think about it guys, what the hell.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:40:27
What are you talking about? The majority decision is consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:06:58
8mb blocks would need 13kB/s internet speed and in the whole month will take 36GB of space. That's a joke for todays tech.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:31:35
As if you're any better.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:26:29
You have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:58:15
Keeping at 1mb blocks is a threat. It will still be 1mb blocks in 2019 with a chance of LN network emerging by that time. Developer centralization is not good at all too. Bitcoin Core is going against the ecosystem by forcefully pushing small blocks, but they can't see that because they are too self-absorbed.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:45:23
If people are going to use btc for small payments daily, you will not be seeing small fees.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:12:17
Timing is the same as slow in this case. If I have to do the payment now, timing doesn't matter does it? Or, I should use fiat then, right? It's strange that you keep defending this stance, that its the users fault. It clearly is not.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:05:14
Patents are not, true.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:02:00
You think like that, just because you think you have consensus for it. Actually, you don't. If you had, SegWit would not be used only by 5% of transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:52:14
There are multiple bch developers not following him or believing his lies. Unfortunately that's not a good thing for your agenda and you will always deny it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:09:51
Bitcoin hardforks always was and always will be voted by hashpower. That is in the whitepaper and that is how it is supposed to work. Right now it has supermajority of hashpower and you should just accept it and start preparing your own minority fork.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:13:31
Have you ever read about AsicBoost? It is not exploiting any flaw, it is reusing cached resources for less work (more electricity saved), which is an innovation. Competing mining companies should innovate more, and bitcoin should not discourage it. AsicBosst itself does not encourage mining empty blocks, they are done for other reasons. I don't think stiffling competition is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:43:28
Because its not ready and will not be ready in the near future.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:38:16
Dude, the ability to send any amount, anywhere in the world without a third party can cost a fraction of a cent if the network would not be overloaded! Can you imagine that? Practically free! It's not the users fault it's a dollar fee right now, it's the network. In the past 4 years there was not a single meaningful scaling solution to overcome this obstacle, yet you are here defending the network. How is it users fault, how can you come to that conclusion?
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:42:49
Maybe SegWit is not as good as you think? Why is the adoption so low at this point? If it's a good scaling solution for the bigger blocks, why is it still used by only 5% of transactions? If it's a good way to scale, surely, it would be adopted more? Do you actually think they are not using these solutions, just because they are intentionally trying to destroy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:46:32
Do you understand that high fees are caused by the congested network? But its a gold storage so it doesnt matter.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:36:22
What do you mean by "forced a miner to play fair"?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:25:19
Direct quote from the whitepaper: 
"The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
I don't see what's there to misinterpret.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:08:11
I don't like high fees. I feel like if you want it to be revolutionary, the high fees has to go. It doesn't matter if I'm rich or not, if the fees are there it's a bottleneck. For adoption or any new innovations which require low fees, bitcoin is a nono. That's why I hate high fees, not because I can't afford them. You are completely missing the point.
