So you are just sitting on your couch doing nothing. Go work at McDonalds or get a degree in something that's relevant. I don't know what to tell you other than get off your ass. You should be able to find a job its not hard unless you're a felon.

If we can beat the 500 bitcoin sell wall ill be shocked and happy.

Ask yourself if you believe this is the next gold. If you can't answer yes then you should sell. Don't invest in something you don't believe in. I believe though. Bitcoin will be 30k by New Years.

we've fought through 16k once already today. I don't think 16,400 is realistic. I hope im wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:34:48
I think it legitimizes the coin honestly. The more valuable it is the more it becomes mainstream the more it is being seen as a potential payment method. I don't think wanting Fiat is bad and I don't think bitcoin and fiat are mutually exclusive. I think they both can serve a purpose. That's just my rambling 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:24
I love this feeling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:28:22

I wanted to invest in something cheap and unknown. I was trying to "diversify" my crypto and it seems like a good coin. Mcafee subsequently tweeted about it too and that got me excited, but then I learned he does it for every coin. As of right now I feel kind of dirty owning it.

You either believe or you don't.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:42:31
That makes sense. XRP might be my next investment. I think having all those coins for me would be a lot to keep up with. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:42:44
Curious what else you guys hold and why. I hear good things about a lot of coins. I currently am in:
My largest stake is in big daddy bitcoin. I like all these coins. I'm thinking about reddcoin. I just don't have enough moneys to get into a lot of them.

alright you fucks. This is the price we pay for decentralized currency. DO NOT panic. This will settle just because coinbase adds a currency does not mean bitcoin is worth less. Do not listen to the shills. DO NOT PANIC. Bitcoin has to survive attacks like this if this whole decentralized store of wealth is going to work. It hasn't even dropped badly yet and people are freaking. Do not be emotional about this people. We are stronger than this.

@_date: 2017-12-03 02:13:47
That's just wrong. I saved up 1k when I was 8 and put it all in home depot. I had been saving since kindergarten. Lots of kids especially who have the initiative to do a lemonade stand love the idea of investing and bitcoin is hype right now.

College is expensive because the government inflates the price and we als o have the top universities in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:46:42
If it goes up then you doubly fucked yourself. The moral of the story is unless you're trying to day trade. You should not worry about timing the up and down swings. You're more likely to fuck yourself this way.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:33:50
You either believe or you don't. The price is going to fluctuate as the hype around this thing builds. Its becoming mainstream quickly. People are making their money and cashing out. Better be ready to weather the storms I bought bread and milk I am prepared.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:44
You buy now or buy lower what's it matter if it's 100k in 2018

He would get shit upon if he did this. He always does but he would so even more.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:39:27
There are obviously lots of factors at play. I think BTC shouldn't have a problem growing at the same rate or even more.
