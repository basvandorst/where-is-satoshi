I'm more concerned about signal company owning the route to delivering software.

Package managers are a good thing but I worry that someday down the road that people might forget that there ever was anouther way. On all the desktop OS's you can use a package manager, you can pick others or you can download the software directly. There is no (software equivolent of) censorship. But with iOS in particular if you are an overage user you only get apps via apple and they have a say in what you can get. WiFiFoFum for example is an app I got through the appstore and has since been removed. Now I can jailbreak but to most users that's scary and not worth the hastle. Android is in the middle somewhere. I was being silly with my comment BTW.

I think it's more to do with the fact the playstore seems so much part of the OS and the phone that it's difficult to get your head around it's absence. It's not an East West thing, most people don't think in those terms.

Hey Now. I set up a coinbase account two days ago because I came to this sub for advice and coinbase was the top voted answer on how to buy bitcoins. Maybe I'm ignorant but I'm not willfully ignorant.
Can you recommend a good way of storing bitcoins on your phone?
Can you recommend a good way of buying them?

No. Software is just messier. You're a developer in (I assume) the US where there is a bit software patent arms race, where addition and subtraction are patentented. I'm a developer in the EU where you can spend 10 years developing something and you can't patent it, there are no software patents in the EU. Both stratagies are flawed, The problem is software doesn't fit neatly into any of the existing catagories. It's not mechanical, it's no literature. It's not fair to patent things that are trivial, it's unfair to not allow a developer to protect something that's really inventive.
By the way, reddit's tendancy to go the extreams on every little thing is annoying. Saying that patents were invented to protect old fashioned inventors doesn't automaticaly mean I hate new fangled inventors, in the same way saying I like Ice cream doesn't mean I hate chocolate.

Back in my day we downloaded software from websites ourselves.

Cool. Cheers. So Mycelium and Darkwallet are like real world wallets. That's where you keep money for immediate spending. Trezor is a bit like your office safe where you keep money kind of safely but with relativly easy access and the last one is like a big vault that's a pain in the ass to get into but though as nails.
Am I right in assuming Mycelium and DarkWallet are kind of hosted and that they don't store the blockchain on your machine? And I assume that Trezor does so you trust that one?
Can I ask you a bit more about the last option, is this an investment? Is "brain" the name of the client? What makes it more secure than Trezor?
Thanks again.

Cool. Thanks for the education.

I agree with patents when you have to build a factory to execute them. That's what they're for, to give the inventor the breathing room to establish and make some money back on their large investment. But software is different.

Can you recomend a wallet and way of buying bitcoins?
I've already bought some just to play arround with but you oviously know more about what's going on. Could you tell me the right way to do things.
