So bitcoin price is positive correlated with inflationary Fiat printing? Nice, then we can only succeed

This is actually one of the best ideas I have seen for a long period of time.. It's a Currency and with flow it will grow. Just like the dollar - the more you use this counterfeit central bank piece of trash the more value it gets.. This is one of a few reasons why the USA loves the Pedro dollar, all oil and gas can only be traded in dollar

I didn't talked about that, I just said it can't be printed to oblivion like the dollar and there is no hyperinflation possible. Currency crisis like the one back in the 20s are a good thing for the btc value... But a bad thing for humanity! Therefore i don't like the bailout - banking system

Can go both ways... If energy price rises the dollar will be weak too and as long as its the world reserve currency others will be weak too... EXCEPT bitcoin! Because it can't be printed like the counterfeit-central bank money! If a Currency crises arises then we are all safe + the guys with precious metals

First the US got rid of the gold standard but I think in the 70s they got rid of the partial gold standard.. Since then the wages stagnated (in relation to the produced output of the economy). So I mean the partial gold standard. Think the first got removed around the 1st world war but I don't know for sure. Yes you are right, they can choose. But I think 07 we reached a point of no return. Since then the debt exploded (+57 trillion from 07 to 15) and now we are sitting at 152 trillion dept globally. In 8 years 1/3 debt gain is insane. This is an inflation... A massive one. Dollar is 10% down and if the US is keeping this policy up (massive military expansion and raising more dept) then they will face the same outcome like every empire did... Too much spending going on while they exploit the world reserve currency.

True. But there will be a major correction of our system. Compound interest is a nasty thing

Love you man but that's a point where I have to disagree 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:26:07
I do I study economics in Vienna, and I think it was a really bold move to switch away from the gold standard.. Now we face some real problems for example since the 70s the wages stagnate and the dept rises while inflation is robbing peoples money (every year another 2%). Borrowing money is now so cheap (for banks not individuals) that we are facing enormous bubbles around the globe. Take a look at the Canadian house market... Insane.. US house market bubnle was nothing compared to the Canadian house bubble now! The financial market is gaining money but the real world not and with the gold standard we wouldn't face those problems that much
