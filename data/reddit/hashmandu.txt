To me it seems like warren buffet, or more so anyone from his time period (I don't really know buffets whole story tbh) were in the right place at the right time. I mean if you had money to invest back then, right at the ground floor when the whole world switched to full fiat money and very low interest rates it'd be hard not to become wealthy. I mean shit, my grandpa bought like $500 in wrigley gum stock in the 40s or something and it turned into like $500,000 50-60 years later. Buying ANY public company that had staying power back then would have made you a lot of money. hodling the S&amp;P/DOW even easier.

So are you saying people in the 1940s-50s (when buffet started) didn't have an advantage of timing in the market for something like the DOW index or real estate? Have you seen the prices of those things from back then? DOW was less than 300 (23.5k now) and land was going for like $30 an acre, Buffets first major purchase was 40 acres for only $1200 in 1945. even adjusted for inflation these are ridiculously cheap prices. Also only 5 percent of americans were investing in the 50s, not sure that counts as "plenty" compared to over 50 percent invested now.
Again, my point is less about buffet as he is indeed an exeedingly good investor but you'd be blind to say his timing of initial entry (and others who got into stocks and real estate at this time) didn't help. 
My parents didn't start investing until the late 80s early 90s. stocks and real estate had already been inflated considerably by that point. they we're too busy living the farm life up until that point.  I used my grandpa as the example because he would be about Warrens age and i know they kind of started investing at the same time. Warren was working with a lot more money than my grandpa as well so if my granpda could turn 500$ into 500k imagine where $100,000-1,000,000 back then would land you now.

Can you link me to a good documentary or something like that about Warren Buffett?

How great would it be if the limo drivers and shoe shiners ultimately ate his lunch.
