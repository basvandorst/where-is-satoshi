I think people are not getting the big picture. 2mb, 4mb and even 20mb blocks will not solve the scalability deficit of bitcoin vs traditional payment methods. If bitcoin were to go mainstream as a payment method, the blocksize should go to something over 100mb. And for me it seems completely not feasible, in terms of its conception, as a descentralized network. I think there is a philosophical problem here. It seems to me bitcoin will never be a widespread payment network for every kind of transaction. If so, it will not be bitcoin anymore, because it would lead to strong (really strong) centralization. But it could work as a very strong and secure descentralized settlement layer, where payment layers as Lightining Network and other solutions could provide the transaction granularity. People do not use their bank accounts for every transaction they make. They withdraw bigger amounts using ATMs and spend the money gradually. Or they use other layers (like Visa and Mastercard) and then, settle the balance in the nd of the month, paying the bill using only one transaction.

A thread on r/btc with Tomas Zander and other implementations devs arguing why Deadalnix decided abruptaly the way to go. Search there. It is up to you to keep informed.

I received a link by email. I am looking for it. When I find I post here.

The miners decide everything (in this case, Jihan, who directly or indirectly controls ~80% of BCh hash power). They have only one actual developer, deadalnix, who works for the miners. The DDA/EDA solution was pushed down the community throat, even when a lot of them were evaluating other algorithm solutions. A lot of tech BCH supporters were surprised and got mad because of this. This makes clear what they will do when there is no consensus or when the miners want something. It is not what cryptos is all about. If you think it is ok, you dont understand the real value of blockchains bring to us. It is just slower paypal 2.0 with no accountability! Thanks, but NO!
Bitcoin is different. Core proposed Segwit more than a year ago. And it was just activated recently. Simply because Core cannot force any change on the network. And its what cryptos are all about.
Core have 100’s of developers. Any dev can make proposals to Core. I can make, you can make a proposal.

I found it. Dont get used to it. In this space people should do their own proper due dilligence. 
It is a thread to inform the ABC client update for the HF. I am sending a permalink to Thomas Zender comment and another from other community member. But you should read the full thread.
Deadalnix tries to explain that they are pushing it down everybodys throat cause they are in a hurry because of the imminent segwit2x hf. But it does not explaing anything. At anytime someone can come up with another explanation to do this again. This is not what cryptos are all about. It is not bitcoin.

What are you talking about? I spent 30 minutes to search something to give information for some stranger who could be some Bcash troll! Man, get a life. Or go help someone. It will make your miserable life better! Or not ...

Sorry for the aggressive line. But we are full of trolls around here lately.

I read it in r/btc. I wont waste my time doing a job for you. If you dont want to search for the thread, believe in what you want. I told you where to search for ir.

This is the reason why bitcoin lost its market share recently. But some want to pretend the majority wish is stalling growth. I think it is the other way around.

Yeah, yeah ... you are right ... but wait ... naaaahhh, it is bouncing back up ... just nonsense ungrounded FUD ...
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:45:24
Sure. But this shows how the market is sensitive to FUD. That is exactly what I meant. Does not matter if they ban or not. Mkt should already moved on!
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:51:12
Hope so.
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:12:53
No. Just the opposite. It will rise. But strange how the mkt is so slow to move on this time.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:22:34
People said the same when it hit 2900. Then it fell to 1900 and raised trough 2900 again and hit 5000. You must be new to BTC. This happens all the time. Always hitting new ATHs.

Some big exchanges like Bittrex halted Bitcoin transactions (not trade) some hours (some for 24 hours) prior to Bitcoin Gold launch. Once most of segwit transactions come from big exchanges, it is normal this drop.

It shows the volume of buy (green) and sell (red) orders by price point. The tall green wall near the current price indicates a strong buy pressure in the short term.

It is poloniex. Not a brazillian exchange.
