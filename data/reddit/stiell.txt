Thanks, corrected.
To elaborate, block mining largely follows a [Poisson process]( with an average rate of one block every 10 minutes. This means that for any given 10-minute interval (e.g. starting immediately after a block), the probability of not finding any block is 1/*e* (not 50% as I implied earlier with 2 as the base).
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:31:46
Hashrate varies, so such delays can happen more often. E.g., with a hashrate 10% lower than what the difficulty would match, such a delay would happen on average every ~4 months. 25% lower, every ~24 days.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:15:48
Assuming constant hashrate, delays of 109 minutes or longer happen on average every *e*^(109/10) blocks = ~1 year.
EDIT: corrected wrong base.

They can't just extend the expiry date on existing tokens, as BCC holders should be able to exchange their BCC tokens for BTC by December 31. They would have to issue an additional token pair with a different expiry date.

Consider this: Alice and Bob open a BTC payment channel between them, with 0.5 BTC at each end. Bob then pays Alice 0.3 BTC across the channel. Alice now has 0.8 BTC on the channel while Bob has 0.2 BTC. While the channel is open, a hardfork with replay protection emerges, named BTX. Due to replay protection, the latest commitment transaction Alice received from Bob is not valid on the BTX chain. How will Alice be assured her 0.8 BTX?
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:57:07


Yes, existing payment channels will be unaffected by intermittent block slowdowns. Blockchain performance only matters when establishing or terminating payment channels.
If one party tries to steal funds from the payment channel by putting an outdated commitment transaction onto the blockchain, the other party can recover the funds by getting a breach remedy transaction onto the blockchain within a specified number of blocks. If the blockchain has slowed down, then they will have more time to react, but they might need a higher fee to get the remedy transaction confirmed in time.

I don't like this solution.  Further down in the thread, apoelstra suggests using magic sequence numbers instead.


With opt-in replay protection, existing off-chain transactions, such as those used in LN, are still valid on the fork, meaning that you can redeem the fork counterpart to your LN bitcoins just like those of your on-chain bitcoins. Bcash implemented mandatory replay protection, breaking such off-chain transactions. Bcash forked off before segwit and LN, so most bitcoins were on-chain, meaning that this breakage was not much of a problem. But with segwit, off-chain transactions will start getting used a lot more, in LN and other smart contracts. On the fork, all LN payments would effectively be reversed, and recovering the funds locked in LN contracts would require manual cooperation and negotiation between the parties. Assuming the fork has any expected market value, then in addition to causing problems that replay protection is supposed to fix, this creates a fungibility problem in Bitcoin prior to the fork: suddenly LN bitcoins are not worth as much as "actual" bitcoins.


Wrong. Read point 2:


containing this marker are considered invalid. Blocks must not contain
transactions with a 'RP=!&gt;1x' marker.
You would only use this marker after the hard fork, at which point transactions with this marker are fully invalid, not just non-standard.


It doesn't hurt to have another option, especially when different wallet software supports different features. I would probably prefer the OP_RETURN method personally, as I know how to do that with the wallet software I use.


As a safety precaution, I personally would not have imported my Bitcoin private keys into Bcash software without first moving my bitcoins, and I don't believe anyone else should be encouraged to risk their bitcoins by doing so either.


Interesting idea. Assuming no other requirement, it would at least leave most smart contracts intact on the fork, including LN.

It's definitely not a niche issue once Lightning Network is operational.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:58:29
You would have to close it before the fork. The whole LN would break down if enough people cared about their forkcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:49:09
If the fork has any expected market value then that will disturb the value of bitcoins locked in a payment channel or other contract versus on-chain bitcoins prior to the fork. Only the funding transaction will be included in the fork, with no way for participants to spend their share without cooperation between the participants. There is a risk of funds being irrecoverable due to lost keys or hostage scenarios.
One cannot expect contract designers to anticipate all kinds of replay-protected forks and have their software preemptively sign their transactions for those forks. Even if a replay protection scheme is designed that allows people to opt out by constructing their transactions in a particular way, existing off-chain transactions may be broken.
A possible option is to design an opt-in replay protection scheme and implement this in existing Bitcoin wallets that need replay protection.
A responsible fork arguably needs replay protection, but if replay protection is to serve its very purpose it must also work for off-chain transactions. There is no solution for this that can be deployed today as far as I know. The conclusion then is that there is currently no way to create a responsible hard fork of Bitcoin.

Why did you mask out the bitcoin address but not the QR code containing, among other things, the bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:31:42
The problem is you don't necessarily have the keys to redeem your part of the funds aside from using the current pre-fork signed transaction.

I'm seeing claims that Bitmain holds a Chinese patent to ASICBOOST. If so, it would be odd if they have implemented this in a covert form. If they hold the patent I'd imagine they would be in favour of detecting competitors' use of the algorithm and thus oppose covert implementations. Only the covert form is incompatible with SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:27:54
I suppose even the patent holders would want to use a covert form though, as the fact that this method was patented without a free licence caused a lot of concern, with suggestions of a fork to disable the method.

One would have to be careful about subsidising miners that are not known to effectively have caused activation. Otherwise they might happily play both ends, signalling just to collect the subsidy, but stopping before it would cause activation.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:13:03
What I get from this is that a big chip manufacturer (with a small-sounding chip name?) opposed SegWit because it's incompatible with their covert implementation of the patented ASICBOOST algorithm.
@_date: 2017-04-10 23:03:40
An incentive scheme could be implemented as part of a soft fork such that those who contributed to its activation it could receive an extra reward once the new rules have been activated.
For example, in the case of SegWit, a rule could be added that required the coinbase transaction in the first X mined blocks after activation to pay a portion of the fees collected from SegWit transactions to the miners that contributed to SegWit activation. That way early SegWit users would effectively pay for SegWit activation through their fees.

It's easy to contribute to a fork such as B2X under a pseudonym. Yet all these hardfork attempts have clearly lacked the necessary workforce and competence.

Including a block hash in a signed commit would prove that the commit was signed *after* that block was found. That's not a bad idea, and it's used e.g. in [Qubes canaries]( but it doesn't solve the problem OpenTimestamps solves. What OpenTimestamps provides in this case is proof that a signed commit was made *before* a certain block was found.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:03:29
So VeriBlock can save about 28% on their transactions if they use SegWit. Normal bitcoin transactions can save around 30–40% using SegWit. In other words, normal bitcoin use has a relative advantage over VeriBlock in moving to SegWit.
Luke *may* have had a point about "unfair advantage" or "bad incentive" if SegWit gave VeriBlock excessive fee savings compared to normal bitcoin transaction fee savings. But it's quite the opposite.

Has the possibility of implementing a [PoW change via a softfork]( been considered?
For example, if a majority of the existing hashing power forks off from the BIP148 chain, a sort of extension blocks with a new PoW algorithm could be generated between the base blocks to account for the loss of hashing power, still keeping e.g. 1MB/10min limit, with base blocks having to pay a part of their generated coins to new-PoW miners (and of course not being able to include transactions that conflict with those already confirmed by extension blocks).
As base-PoW difficulty goes down, or base-PoW hashrate increases, base blocks are generated at an increased rate can replicate transactions previously included in the extension blocks, to allow non-upgraded software to (at least eventually) follow and confirm transactions after the softfork. Other base-PoW miners could still try to sustain a different fork, but they would then eventually be considered stale by non-upgraded software if the new-PoW softfork has the more valuable chain.
The "[hardfork-ness]( of this softfork would only be as much as necessary to stay alive in the presence of other forks.
