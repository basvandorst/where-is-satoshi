Yeah, it's based on stolen credit cards.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:37:22
Do you even believe this yourself anymore?
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:43:40
Lol, one man controlling the entire bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:41:49
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:47:37
Right, why would you need to? The vast majority of bitcoiners are able to fuck up in all kinds of creative ways and be their own SFYL.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:14:48
In reality 99% of CS experts won't touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole because they realize the scaling problem is probably unsolvable.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:26:05
Right. There are plenty of ways to track it.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:45:57


That sure explains why everyone will want to run a lightning node!
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:49:49


This is called basic scientific honesty, and it's supposed to be the norm, not the exception. Back is being honest, I suppose that makes him a sensation in the cryptocurrency world.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:24:15
Blockstream gets its operating capital from VCs. How do you think they plan to get their money back?
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:49:06
No no no, THIS time it'll be different.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:33:36
Yep.  Claiming that intentionally complicating an already byzantine and badly designed protocol is a "simplification" is outright silly.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:26:19
Lol, a "protocol simplification" consisting of thousands of lines of extra code.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:36:34


You're closing in on the truth
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:29:37


How do you define "highly skewed voting"? Is it the same as "an outcome I don't agree with"?
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:22:28
'EU: Elected bureaucrats' just doesn't have the same ring to it :(
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:21:39
one butt
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:10:39
They can have undercover cops pose as customers and prosecute the other party of the transaction. Decentralization does not help at all.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:09:40
I'm sure no one will notice.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:00:11
I KNEW this was going to be good for bitcoin! I just KNEW it!
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:35:05
That sounds like something a heretic would say!
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:25:53


No... this cannot be!!!
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:18:45
The free market rewards the best and the brightest with its invisible hands.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:34:08
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:30:57


That sounds like socialism!
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:28:18


Lol, so now basic everyday honesty is considered "remarkable humility" in the bitcoin space
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:43:01
SFYL: Priceless
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:58:56


That's against Satoshi's commandments.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:12:50
Also it's 1850 and the airplanes won't be around for a long time.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:55:12
The miners are the ones who make the important decisions, the rest will fall in line.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:27:36
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:31:58
Of course it is.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:45:22
Yes, the faithful will be rewarded.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:36:47
Welcome to @_date: 2017-01-19 12:42:50
Maybe after thermos finds the courage to donate this reddit to a responsible steward? 
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:48:48
Reddit admins care deeply about bit-coin
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:03:42
Sounds like you're very scared of black people. Why is that?
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:13:05
They're not going to laugh at organised credit card fraud.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:51:32
So you're saying that the 1-star reviews are actually the fake ones???
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:20:57


All of this is a lie.
@_date: 2017-01-28 12:55:37
Bitcoiners are the perfect victims.
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:23:41
How much do you lose in the conversion fees/rates?
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:46:57
And bitcoin, of course.
@_date: 2017-01-28 12:40:35


So they're not outright criminal, only incompetent?
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:01:12
Unless bitify agrees to pay for the stolen gift cards,  report them to the cops for assisting in a fraud.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:33:27


Lol, America
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:34:13
Well they keep quoting him so I'd say yes.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:03:01
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:17:37
Your mum is right.
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:51:27
Too bad only the miners matter.
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:08:34
The druggies can switch over to any other cryptocurrency, they are all practically identical and perfect substitutes for each other.
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:30:43
But don't let that stop you!
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:04:58
Allow? That's capitalism.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:43:44
Yes it is.
@_date: 2017-04-19 09:25:47
No it doesn't. This is patently​ untrue.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:15:55
This is FUD, as we all know that bitcoin is backed by math
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:52:49
This nonsense is what libertarians actually believe!
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:12:46
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:35:34
*human feemale's*
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:20:16


Stop dealing drugs.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:53:28
I'm sorry, I don't see how that translates into an advantage for the customer, which is what we were talking about.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:11:43
In some people's imagination, yes. In reality it remains to be proven.
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:34:41


Actually he's a voluntaryieust.
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:23:29
And you have all freely chosen to run the Bitcoin protocol which is owned by Jihan Wu and other worthy Captains of Industry.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:08:11
Lol your dream society is a society of diseased illiterate paupers
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:29:25
Lol, your solution to all problems is "let's hope (p.s. whatever you do don't outlaw my buttcoins)"
@_date: 2017-04-16 10:28:48
You already did. it's a mystery.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:10:05
Yes, you just use the POWERFUL COMMAND LINE INTERFACE and it'll give you a quick hit of bitcoin in no time at all.

If Ver sells 100k coins for actualmoney he becomes very rich, the opposite of poor.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:42:38
They can just dump it on small-time bagholders and invest in something better.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:22:10
Immutability cannot even in principle lower the cost for consumers if it hurts them more than it helps the businesses, which is clearly the case with bitcoin. It's a terrible idea overall.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:18:01
That's communism because it's breaking the NAP.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:15:46
Wow, that would have taken care of all the 0 times my bank transactions have been reversed without my consent!
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:22:09
It will buy you a stolen bike though. Makes you think.
@_date: 2017-04-11 23:50:16
Actually Roger Ver is a voluntaryeiyist which is the highest form of libertarianism.
