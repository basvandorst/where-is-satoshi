Right, I pay my share. Point is 10% to buy stoicks plus capital gains makes gains less likely. If I gain here IRS and me win:)

I bought my first BTC at $338 and another at 600 range and watched it sit and not do anything until the news started talking abou it. 
I feel like Bitcoin is still early. Could become a global currency. It could carash. I like the fact that when I get a dollar from the bank it will lose money vian inflation and the value of a dollar has rarely increased. When I buy stocks I pay for the fees and assume all the risk. But this little coin has the me in the upside and I like that.

Apple could get halted if it swng like Bitcoin, Anyalst and funds would lose billions and jobs. The market is very planned at the apple layer. yet one wrong move by the CEO and Apple is MCI and post bankruptcy new shares are issued and those old holders are gone. 
When people ask me how do I trust virtual or digital currency I tell them to look in their wallet. For me my check is direct deposited. I can get cash but cans is hard to spend and withdraw too much and you are in a system depoist too much and in the system and the deposit too much is the real issue. You get over 100K and then you are not protected. I can have my identity stolen, equofax can be hacked and credit cards are stolen. My money is virtual/Digital and it is only working for the bank holding it. My Bitcoin and ETH is working for me. I lose on the dips but I win on the highs. I can't say the same for my traditional situation.

It is amazing. I am in the Oil and Gas industry and our invoices are insane. So many zeros at a time. Either side could lose their ass with interchange. Swapping a few hundred you might not check the exchange rates but they move and that movement can be terrible when margins are not fat. It can be good for the other party. Bitcoin levels that playing field. I am not sure I have ever seen the answer to what a global currency might look like. Why would a person in London want to use USD as the standard and what about the trillions in debt. Gold was this once in our history, but Microsoft can't accpet gold for my Surface Pro. I can get a shovel and probably find gold. Gold is not a tapped resource. At 21 million what happens? I am excited to find out. 
I am new and late to the game but way up. I see people everyday asking about it. My young kids are asking about it and they have seen me cursing out my e-trade account and never asked about stocks or retirement. Times are changing. Happy to have found you all and got on the roller coaster
