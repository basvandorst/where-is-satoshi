The global markets are getting hit hard by these trade wars

It’s been a real pleasure everyone!  I’ve decided to forget about my bitcoin for a while and leave it on my ledger.  Not checking prices for a while.  Meliora!

NGL, I’m already stacked on Sats but would be so pumped if it crashes down further

Hey man, i consider myself a skeptic so I’m in the same mindset as you, given that I think you are probably right in that someone is trying to instill fear.

This is it boys!  My btc is now in cold storage and out of Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:07:23
Ehh, wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, I would love nothing more than to buy again at those prices

I actually like Coinbase, but storing crypto is best done off exchanges.  If something happens (hacks, phishing, etc.) only usd is insured on Coinbase not btc.

Good point!  I think I am in it for the long haul as well, HODL!

So you are going long? Good choice but after this bull season recedes (which history tells us it will) you don’t want to acquire more btc?

What are y’alls plans to maximize profits this bull season? One option I can think of is setting incremental stop losses after every major milestone to guarantee profits. I guess a lot of you will also long bitcoin for the next couple years...? Just want to see how you guys plan on weathering this one...
BTW posited the same question on cryptocurrency daily discussion board (May 11), just wanted to hear from some bitcoin maximalists ��
