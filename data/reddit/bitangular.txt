* Yes, this is a VPS that can be used for a bitcoin full node or other server applications. For mining you need direct access to hardware since all cloud mining services are essentially over-priced scams.
* It's a german company, I suppose they speak english.

The CEO of Blockchain. Seriously? So innovative. Listen to him talking, he is so smart as he solves all the worlds problems. "It doesn't have to be this way."

Thank you for this explanation, I was wrong assuming 1 MB blocks. Blocks will get bigger.

Thank you for this clarification. However, it might still be useful to just look at the amount of data required to make a transaction, even if it includes other data, such as witness data, header etc.. Therefore the question is, how long it will take until the average size of data required to make a transaction will be smaller than today (~214 Bytes; btw.: this number was taking all data of a block into account). 
Edit: My assumption of 1 MB blocks was wrong. See post by sroose.

They should, if you include witness data. Let's assume that blocks are full. As of now, each block is just below 1 MB. When segwit transactions and witness data will be included, blocks will - for quite some time - still be full. However, the average size of a transaction, including witness data, should go down. Especially for transactions with many inputs and outputs. For others I agree, it won't make much of a difference. 
Edit: This is not correct; my assumption of 1 MB blocks was wrong. See answer by sroose.
