Banks love closing accounts for big gambling deposits or withdrawals. Btc is way easier. 
Also pokerplayers send big payments to different countries alot for staking/bets/debts etc which is way easier in btc

Wrong. He is just simply wrong. Same as when he called all internet stocks scams and he still didnt buy anything like amazon fb etc. He is too old to understand it so he sticks to good old
Industrials, which is ok. Calling something you dont understand a scam or ratpoison is just childish and stupid

Just use banker, it already has a negative connotation.

As a investment unrelated to the stock market to deversify it will in my opion. First they will share the spot i think. So diversified portfolios might be 80% stocks 10%bonds 5% gold 5% btc. If that happens to a majority of acively managed funds we are probably at 200k btc or higher

Maybe it was none of your imaginary numbers that triggered anything. Maybe people got scared bcs of the binance hack?

That conception of „whales doing trades to flush out the little guy“ are beyond pathetic.
Whales couldnt give less of a shit about what happens to the small leverage traders (which are mostly loosing trades with very small balances), not everything is about you...
Most of the time IF what you say is correct the whales would basicly burn 10% of their position just to kick out small guys?? Wtf is that reasoning

Generally mining as a individual is pretty much useless and &gt;90% a loosing business plan. Hodling the crypto you mine instead does almost always better

As a pokerplayer I got questions like that from
Banks allllll the time. Nowadays a high % of players started using bitcoin do finally be able to do transactions with each other in minutes instead of days and without questions and the doom of a chance of the accounts beeing closed or frozen if the banks dont agree.
All those mentioned points get multiplied when dealing with sending different currencies to different continents, while btc still works fine, fast and cheap.
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:12:44
I want immunity to banks or other third parties having the power to lock my funds (which happened twice already).
Also its faster to send btc to friends on other continents, I much rather send them btc in 1min than waiting for a bank for days (or longer if its a weekend)

Gold can be faked - a btc cant
gold cant be split for transactions easily - btc can
Gold is hard to store and heavy - i can carry 20mil in btc in my mind / a sheet of paper / a usb stick
Gold is not indestructible and if not stored properly slowly erodes - btc lasts forever
New gold will always be found - btc is capped forever
New altcoons beeing created doesnt matter they are not bitcoin, its like saying new metals are found, it doesnt affect  gold either.
But do what you think is right, gold will work as a negative correlated asset to the market but IMO bitcoin will do the same maybe even better.

Bitcoin is like gold a inverse asset to the stockmarket sentiment (or atleast I expect it to be). Thats why it should go up in my mind because increasing chance of war -&gt; risk -&gt; stocks down -&gt; gold/btc up
