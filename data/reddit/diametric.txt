That's not the same excuse. A significant portion of is very technically savvy about Bitcoin and the blockchain. For fucks sakes some of the core bitcoin developers hangout here, are you telling me THEY aren't qualified to understand the blockchain?
The people here have been dealing with MtGox for years, Bitcoin for years, they have first hand knowledge of MtGox deposit and withdraw addresses, they have their own wallet transactions full of evidence of which addresses MtGox owned at one point or another.  This is what makes these people better equipped to investigate the blockchain than law enforcement, even if they hired a consultant.

Right. Put cash in an envelope and mail it. It's *totally* safe and will never get stolen by mail workers.  Even if it was secure, it would only work domestically. I don't have all manner of foreign currencies sitting around for me to selectively pay people in.  


Really? I mean we're talking about the merits of Bitcoin here, and you're telling me a viable alternative is to pay potentially thousands of dollars to fly somewhere to buy something?  I routinely order things from a small machinist in Belgium.  Maybe ~$50USD worth of items every few months.  But yeah you're right, I should be flying there every time. 


Now who's the 5 year old.  Really, 99% of companies are multi-national and have local operations all over the world? 
There is currently, no other way outside of Bitcoin (and it's clones) to safely, and securely send value across the world, near instantly, with little to no fees, and without having to place trust into someone to handle the transaction.  It just doesn't exist outside of Bitcoin.  Mailing cash doesn't count.  Flying somewhere and paying for it locally doesn't count (and is a hilariously bad example to begin with).  And acting like shopping at only Walmart type places is solution is even more laughable.

Not in this case.  The fraud facilitated the theft, but the theft itself was not against the bank. Someone fraudulent ly used your identify in order to make a withdraw. It's a distinction that's important. The FDIC protects you from theft by the bank (or in traditional terms, a bank robbery). No from someone unauthorized to access your account (fraud).

I love when comments like this backfire. The Coinbase is the name of the transaction miners add to the block while they're doing the proof of work. It's how the reward is divvied out. The miner that finds the block gets his special coinbase transaction minted, and it becomes real.  
What btchombre is saying is that nobody moved them. They still exist as coinbase transactions.  Its an incredible good chance they belong to Satoshi.

They know exactly what they're doing.  They know a proposition like that would never work. So instead of outright saying "Bitcoin should be illegal and banned" they're trying to act like they're welcoming of the new technology, but want to regulate it out of "safety." Then regulations get imposed that are mutually exclusive with how the technology actually works, thus banning it.

I think you didn't read it. You don't have to report it, you still have to pay taxes on it.  For example, I did $400's worth of consulting for a friends business. Because it's under $600, he doesn't have to file a 1099-MISC on what he paid me (had it been in cash, bitcoin, gold nuggets or beanie babies).  I am legally obligated to report that income and pay taxes on it (less my expenses of course). A lot of people don't because it's difficult to prove outside of an audit.

Not really.. I mean, even if you had 20,000 users on your site every day,  with an average mining rate I'd say of 10MH/s (I'm being generous) that would result in something around 195GH/s.  At todays difficulty and price, thats about $5 a day in revenue.
Only very large sites have 20K people on them concurrently at that rate.  Hopefully someone else feels like putting more effort into the math, I spent about 30 seconds doing it and its likely no where near accurate, but even if I'm off by many factors its still chump change.

Distributed mining is at the very center of what makes Bitcoin viable.  When an entity gains the majority of compute power in the network, decentralization and the trustless nature of Bitcoin disappears. Without decentralization and trustlnessness, what makes Bitcoin any different than PayPal, other than having lower fees?

@_date: 2014-04-18 15:58:25


Sure, but there is a lot of reasons to accept that risk.  If I'm selling items under 25 bucks, in person, I'm willing to accept that risk.  An in-person double-spend would require a significant amount of coordination with more than one party to accomplish, making it less than worthwhile to do for such a small gain.  
Now if I'm selling a car? I'll be damn sure to wait for a lot of confirmations before I sign over the title. But then that's okay, because the sale of a car is not a fast transaction, and nobody expect it to be.
The same thing applies to fiat currency.  Nobody checks the validity of small bills.  People accept the risk that credit cards could result in a chargeback, and it's a much higher risk than Bitcoin double spends.  A double spend just results in the loss of the product you sold, and it's value.  A chargeback often results in additional losses, last time I held a merchant account it was somewhere around USD$40 in fees if you had a chargeback applied to your account.
In the end, I don't think anyone selling small items in person for Bitcoin is going to fret over a double spend, and there's been testimony by such merchants here to that effect.

I'm not sure so you easily setup an arrangement with a miner to buy 30K coins.  In principle sure, but there is a lot more to it. Which miners have that amount they're willing to sell for near market value? Those same miners would then have to have the mentality that bitcoin has peaked, and selling now is a wise move (or be otherwise pinched for cash).  Then there is trust.  How do you arrange a sale like that and be sure you don't get scammed? The USMS inherently provides a level of trust that has value itself.  
Then there's the possibility that whoever bought the coins, $20M is a drop in the bucket if they could use those coins to destabilize the biggest threat to their current business model. Who's to say VISA didn't buy the lot of coins with nefarious purposes in mind?

I hate this reasoning. So then we should just shutdown all other mining and let ghash.io mint blocks forever right? This is what you're suggesting. If someone controls over 51% of the mining power, and the community decides thats okay, then the purpose of a distributed proof of work system is pointless. 
The whole fucking reason for proof of work, block rewards, transaction fees, and mining in general are to create an atmosphere where no single entity gets to control the minting of blocks because everyone wants to try to mint a block.

Of course, but those individuals are the ones stupidly giving someone else the power to become that.  Sure, the moment ghash.io starts manipulating blocks people will abandon the pool.  Unfortunately, it's too late at that point. The damage will be done, and we'll have undone a significant amount of progress.

I agree it's about perception and we should change the perception that the foundation has any kind of authority.

Yes, but not because of the confirmation time. The confirmation time has nothing to do with it.  I mean credit cards have over 24 hours for a confirmation time, with a chance months down the road to have a transaction reversed.   A merchant would jump at the chance to sell goods where the confirmation time was an hour tops.  
It's not prime time for physical use because of integration. POS terminals, retail systems, etc.

Not within the first 24 hours. At least not with any of the merchant providers I've used like Authorize.net.  Worse, is when you get a chargeback. Months later, suddenly the purchase + $45 (fee may vary) gets pulled from your account without notification.   Then you have to fight it to try to get it back, and almost never do.
Chargebacks are the bane of merchants that accept credit cards.  Given the very low risk for double spends on 0 confirmation transactions, even if there was a few people that tried and succeeded, the losses from that would be nothing compared to the losses I experienced accepting credit cards.  As far as I'm aware, no current Bitcoin merchant has ever encountered fraud from a 0 confirm double spend, with the exception of the blockchain fork in March of 2013 due to a bug.

I think you mean to say so few of us ever have had to legitimately use it.  It swings the other way though, vendors are constantly scammed using chargebacks.  They're scammed in all sorts of ways. Straight up fraud where a customer uses his card to pay, and then claims product is defective when it isn't, and gets chargeback.  Worse is when customers have legitimate problems, but then don't ever try to resolve them with a vendor who would be more than willing to work with them.  They liberally use the chargeback system as a replacement for what should be a warranty issue. 
The biggest problem by far is stolen identities and credit cards used to make purchases. This one really sucks because from the initial victim's perspective, it is a valid use of the chargeback system.  However, in reality, all this does is shift who the victim is. Now vendors become the victim of both its customer's stupidity and the criminal's intent.   Not only do you have to worry about criminals, now you have to take responsibility for when someone else falls victim to a phishing scam.  Sure, CVV2, address verification, and even phone and name verification is suppose to alleviate that, but almost any good phishing site will ask for all that information. There really is no protection for vendors in this area. 
This is why for merchants/vendors Bitcoin is a miracle. It is literally the equivalent of Internet cash.  You do however have a legitimate concern, but that concern has existed for centuries before electronic payment systems existed.  As a buyer, you now need to use your brain and common sense. You can't rely on someone else to protect you from the evils of the world all the time.  There are tools you can use to arm yourself with.   for example provides a Web of Trust framework for dealing with individuals to help you identify who is less likely to scam you. 
Over time other solutions will evolve, but I think they will shift the responsibility and cost to the consumer, instead of to the merchant.

If it's in person, then I'm less concerned. There are lots of legal ways, contracts for example, that resolve this issue.  
If this is an online transaction, then a reputable Bitcoin friendly escrow service could solve that (speaking of, anyone know of one?).
But you have the same problem when buying stuff on say Overstock.com.  Say you decide to buy 10 BTC worth of sheets.  You're trusting that as a reputable business, Overstock.com will ship them to you. But what happens if they don't?
These aren't really cryptocurrency specific problems. Fiat currencies have these same problems, they might look different, but it's very much the same.  Initiate bank transfer, bank confirms money transfer, car owner doesn't hand over papers.  Pay cash for car, Craigslist scammer takes off running once it's in hand. 
I do like the idea of somehow binding the title to the blockchain, but that's just a dream right now.  Maybe, one day, my great grandkids will be paying for everything using a cryptocurrency, casting votes in elections on the blockchain, and signing contracts via the blockchain.

Decentralized meaning no one authority has the power to manipulate (in any capacity) the currency. 
It must be one or the other. Either a single party can manipulate it, or they can't.  Either ghash.io has the power (maybe not the desire) to manipulate the currency or they don't.

I'm pretty sure the traditional banking industry does not benefit from a free market money like Bitcoin. It threatens their control over currency.

It's not hard to realize it's a scam once you understand it's history. The entire practice is based on a foundation that you need to align your body's "energy" to allow it to heal itself properly.  It's the same "energy" or sometimes referred to as "chi" that accupuncture, reflexology and a host of other bullshit uses to heal you.   At best it acts like a placebo, at worst you end up with additional problems or wasted time forgoing a real treatment.

At a physical store the opportunity to double spend is no greater risk than a stolen credit card being used.  
A physical location accepting Bitcoin should have a POS terminal that can listen on the network and see the transaction broadcast in near real time.  Seeing this broadcast is generally enough to trust that the transaction will eventually be confirmed, and not double spent.  It doesn't guarantee it of course, but neither does a credit card charge, or even cash in certain situations (really well done counterfeit bills).  
The effort required for someone to double spend in a physical store often exceeds the gains of a double spend.  You'd need a second person to push out a second transaction, with higher fees, spending the coins you originally spent.  It's just not worth the effort to get a free coffee or sandwich. Especially given that you've now shown your face in the establishment, and a second trip would be a no go.  
At some places like Best Buy, the risk would obviously go up with big ticket items.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to make someone wait 10 minutes for something in the range of thousands of dollars.  Hell, it took me 45 minutes to pay with a debit card for my MacBook Pro back in 2011.  My bank initially denied the charge (since I'm not at the Apple store buying MacBooks all the time). I had to make several calls, wait on hold, and get the bank along with the Apple Store to coordinate the charge to get it to go through. 
For the sake of argument though, lets say waiting 10 minutes for a multi-thousand dollar charge to go through is too much.  The risk for the double-spender is still very high. Not only does the coordinate attack need to take place just as before, but now you've shown your face in a store with the intent to steal thousands of dollars of merchandise.  You can't hide your face from the cameras, it's not like shoplifting where you can attempt to steal something without being detected.  You're standing there, paying with Bitcoin, in front of people, cameras and other customers.  You'd have a lot of balls double spending like that.
Of course, ALL of the above is entirely moot on online stores, since rarely does an item get purchased and shipped in the same hour window let alone 10 minutes.  So I fail to see why this would mean Bitcoin isn't ready for prime time.

So as most people rightfully assumed it's malware. I managed to get a copy of it so I could poke around with it.  
I was hoping for something a little more exotic that was specifically targeting Bitpay or Bitcoin in some way. It's basically just this or a varient of it: 
Contents of the JAR:
  ./load
  ./load/ID
  ./load/JarMain.class
  ./load/MANIFEST.MF
  ./META-INF
  ./META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
  ./plugins
  ./plugins/UnrecomServer.class
They made no effort to hide that it's Unrecom. I don't typically do java reverse engineering (so someone with more experience might be able to clarify), but decompiling the meat of it (JarMain.class) doesn't seem to indicate that it does anything other than just run an Unrecom server to provide the attacker with remote access to the infected machine.   Here's a small bit of the entry point:
    public static void main(String a[])
        throws Exception
    {
            System.out.println(ALLATORIxDEMOxUnrecomClassLoader("[[ String full of binary data to reconstruct what I presume is the actual unrecom  server ]]"));
          (new   JarMain()).loadClass(ALLATORIxDEMOxUnrecomClassLoader("C\\kYlR"));
        ALLATORIxDEMOxUnrecomClassLoader("o[lS");
It's kind of funny, they go to a bunch of effort to hide the actual unrecom server code inside of what I presume is an encrypted turd later reconstructed back into a valid jar and loaded using the typical java runtime jar loading stuff.  Yet, they leave the damn text labeled as Unrecom..  I mean come on, obfuscate it or something.

The reason people are unhappy with it, and why some think its the end of Bitcoin (I don't, thats a ridiculous notion), is because the recording keeping requirements are a massive pain.  Every time you buy Bitcoin you need to track the fair market price for it (and use the same or similar source consistently throughout the year). Then when you spend Bitcoin, using the same source, calculate your gains or losses, and record them. Every. Single. Time. 
This year alone I think I made, probably 140 purchases on Amazon throughout the year. Imagine each of those had been using Bitcoin I acquired throughout not just this year, but last year as well. I'd have at least a 140 line spreadsheet detailing each purchase, market prices, gain/loss, etc.   For someone that's an accountant (I'm not) that might not be a big deal, but fuck me thats going to be a pain in the ass.

Your first sentence is not completely accurate.  Domains have a lengthy process in which they get removed.  Most good registrars will put the domain on a hold status for 30 days after non-payment and allow you to renew normally. Once the 30 days is up, they will often then put it into whats called redemption period, in which they then charge sometimes upwards of $100 to allow you to renew (on top of the yearly cost).  After what is often a 60 or 90 redemption period, the domain is put into a pending delete status which is then outside of the control of the registrar.  It will then be removed from the registry. Then 5 days after it's been removed from the registry, anyone can now register the domain name. 
Also, it's a little known thing but some registrars will sell redemption period domains to anyone willing to pay for them, not just the original owner.

Having worked in the anti-fraud industry for a decade, you'd be surprised how long it can take for people to notice. And even then, credit cards are cheap. You can easily buy thousands of them online for less than a dollar a card.  
However in the case of credit cards, its even easier to do.  It only requires one person.   Anyone double spending bitcoins in person would need an accomplice to make sure the double spend works.  A habitual double spender would need to go through a lot of effort, with a serious risk that the double spend will fail, with all the same risks of someone using stolen credit cards. 
Sure, a vagabond Bitcoin double-spender, moving from town to town, buying high ticket items with a double spend might succeed. But you're just not going to see a lot of it like you do stolen credit cards.  Someone using a stolen credit card has very little to lose if the credit card fails.  They just go "my bad" or run out the door without the product. 
Someone that fails at double spending risks legitimately buying something they wanted to steal.  The risk of double spends exists today, but plenty of places accept Bitcoin with 0 confirmations and have less fraud than their traditional banking methods.

There's another wallet thats floating around, usually attached to malware. It's a valid Bitcoin wallet, encrypted of course, containing approximately 30 BTC.  It's often labeled as "Frosty" wallet.  It's a clever part of a scam to get you to see the wallet with 30 BTC, and greed causes you to run the attached executable to get the "passphrase to decrypt it."
However, just like this site, it's a real valid wallet. As far as I can tell it's been floating around for a while now, funds have never yet moved.

Yes and no. There's no specific government regulation that spells out LinkedIn explicitly of course. There is however KYC - which basically requires organizations to make attempts to learn whatever they can about their customers. Like several other posters have said this has traditionally been down on the backend, behind the scenes in secret.  Not that I'm trying to be pro-Coinbase here, but they're at least being open about it when they outright ask customers for their LinkedIn profiles instead of just getting it via alternative means.

Of course, but purse.io makes it very convenient and practical.  Imagine someone steals a credit card the old fashioned way, and wants to use it to buy something on Amazon. Now in order to actually realize a gain, they need to have the product shipped somewhere. They need to safely collect that product, not have it linked back to them, and then usually sell the item, again taking more risks. 
Purse.io? They simply buy shit and get glorious BTC back.  Very little risk at all, and very quick gain.  Let's not pretend purse.io isn't rife with this.

Ideally the way it works is certain accounts are marked as having access to their coins via the hot wallets, while others are marked via the cold wallets.  Otherwise you'd end up with a scenario where either 1. All your funds are in cold wallets and if there is a sudden burst of trade activity the exchange won't be able to facilitate it, or worse, 2. where too many funds are in the hot wallet and a bug in the site or compromise results in a massive loss of funds.
