I thought flash was better, well considering that sd cards are nearly indestructible and they can be left in the dust for years and still be used after..

There are always sites that allow you to buy bitcoin cards. Just google for them, as far as i know that's the only way to buy bitcoin with paypal. :/

well so far i have tried this one, imo it's the best one out there : [scrypt.cc](
 Payouts are every 10 minutes, ROI is in 2 months and there is an autoinvestment feature. It's pretty neat, most people say it's a scam because of the high payouts but it's been up for more than a year now, the admin is nice and helpful and payouts are consistent. And i've already won my money back and some more so i think it's pretty legit. Though as for any other site, invest with caution.

Yeah the 'almighty' currency that has devalued more than 96% in the past 100 years...

I've pulled out my original investment already and some more. Admin has said that big changes are coming to make the website more legit looking, since it lacks that (photos of mining equipement, about us section etc..) Though everyone should take their own risk with cloud mining, you could could make a considerable profit, or just lose it all if it ever vanishes. Just a couple of days ago i saw a new 'scrypt mining' website show up and i just lol'ed xD the-mining.com (Really puts everything into perspective)

If you are going to keep bitcoins and want them to be completely secure all you need to do is keep your private key secret. (Be your own bank.)

Well you could be right, even if it has been standing for more than 1 year. I am obviously biased towards it since i personally have gained a profit and have seen that most other people have too, while not seeing people who complain about not being able to withdraw or the top earners complaining. :P Obviously the argument could be made both ways and it's very hard to know what websites are legit or not these days. Everyone should do their own research and decide on their own if they plan to invest in the dangerous cloud mining territory.

You got me all exited thinking someone in mexico was accepting bitcoins. :/

This happens with every new technology, get over it.

This is why i love bitcoin, it's so just so much easier to help others. It's a pretty exciting time to live in. :D

Something that would be easier would be to *actually* get a piggybank and put your private key there lol (Encrypted and hidden of course) 
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:45:53
You don't NEED to trust a third party to exchange bitcoins though.

This is funny. I'm in Mexico and the easiest way to get bitcoin is literally to just go to a regular 7-eleven (Or oxxo) store and buy some from either [Volabit]( or [meXBT]( **Without** any need for a credit card or bank account. In an hour or two you would have your bitcoins, it doesn't get any easier than that.  There's even a service that allows you to withdraw bitcoins from Mexico ATM's. Come on, USA, catch up!
