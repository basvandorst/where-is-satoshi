This will happen in Nov, 90 more days to go.
The moment Bitcoin jumps to US40,000, it will be beyond your league. Still left with Ethereum to chase next year. 
When Bitcoin(Hercules) first started, it was rejected and laugh upon condemned by the whole human world until it shows its true might and race to the top at US20000.
This alerted Zeus of a new force is brewing in humankind
Come November, One of the most prestigious institution New York Stock  Exchange, (The gods, Zeus &amp; Co) got no choice but to accept Hercules with open arms, they just realize that Bitcoin became important and has to invite the discarded prince, Hercules into the palace Kingdom. 
We know what is happening, NYSE(the gods) are full of bad people, lots of jealous prince siblings in there.
Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook &amp; AliBaba.
They will look down on Bitcoin because unlike them, Bitcoin, Hercules is half human half god. Later on Bitcoin will bring in his half brother Ethereum into the palace as well to fight them.

On our 10 anniversary, it is really Idea vs Action. If Bitcoiners cannot figure out which day is more significant, all the more the media has no single bit of clue either? Trully decentralisation yet again!

After reading through my own posting, i roughly come to a conclusion, 31st Oct 2008, release of whitepaper is the more important date, credit to Satoshi Nakamoto, without the idea or whitepaper, there is nothing to work on, nothing to code upon, even though the delivery requires a massive amount of work, however with the coders and programmers available 10 years ago, it is just a matter of time, Bitcoin goes live, it took only 3 months later. I may be wrong in deciding the date ahead of our 10 years anniversary, fellow Bitcoiners....
Disclaimer on this, this is just my personal point of view.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:28:15
Hit the nail, you are a true Bitcoin believer, today seems like a reunion for Bitcoiners alike!
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:45:34
Okay i agree with you, 3rd Jan 2009 was a more significant date, delivering the birth of Bitcoin was by no means an easy task.

Yes May 22 2010, the day I go Pizza Hut for my Pizza, but then again, i still long for the day i can pay my Pizza with Bitcoins at Pizza Hut. Does Papa John joints accept Bitcoins for Pizzas nowadays?
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:36:41
Remember that as Bitcoin Pizza Day, another day we really look forward to and we tend to calculate the price of the pizzas in todays price, haha!
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:02:11
Indeed both are really remarkable events.
which is why we need to think through it, discuss about it before the 10 year anniversary.
Why are they so remarkable, it started a brand new movement in money, 
Money Revolution started with the white paper on 31st Oct 2008, and went to fruition on 3rd Jan 2009. Credits go to Satoshi Nakamoto &amp; Hal Finney!
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:15:31

OMG, that is the day where fellow Bitcoiners celebrate with fun &amp; pride.
Which day was that and who was the infamous person that bought the 2 papa john pizza again?

Agree as well, without it, nothing will be born, also makes real sense
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:54:03
That is why we have this debate, it appears Bitcoiners are kind of split in between, on which day is more important than the other one?
what a debate...

u are right, definitely a bitcoin lover
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:07:08
From here onwards, i believe we will get to 100 to 200k, at around 2021 about 1 year after bitcoin halving, the price will peak and with lots of euphoria, the price will crash by 90%, i am not a financial advisor, but i believe we will from 12 k to possible 200k, its always possible bcos BTC started from 1 cents to 12k, the possibilities are there for the taking

It seems to be true, they try to conjure prices like 1000 to your mind, hoping that u sell asap.
knowing that hodlers are in this reddit, they create as much fear as possible. This is the power of social media and the masterminds behind this crash has done its homework perfectly executed but loopholes still exposed.

Hi, i am new to reddit, just a couple of days old. Hope you guys welcome me.
I have been a supporter of bitcoin ever since dec 2013, when a mate told me that a bitcoin will be worth million dollars in near future.
He explained to me over at starbucks and i had been a believer ever since.
Bitcoin to the moon to the moon

Before we hit USD 2000, these are some of the key figures of the bitcoin community that has made the price possible..
Peter Todd, Vinny Lingham, Craig Wright, Nakamoto, Adam Meister, Jihan Wu, Charlie Lee, Roger Vers, Bill Gates.......
Oh gosh, it is countdown to Year USD2000
Who else did i missed out, please help me out in case i left out some serious important people
To the moon, to the moon, life on bitcoin is interesting everyday because of these colour ful characters.

Me male 38
Adam Bitcoin Meister my favourite
I can see that he is genuinely true and honest to the bitcoin community. I listen regularly to his youtube shows to feel the vibes of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:11:49
I figured out before based on my finance background
A realistic target is USD 50000 per bitcoin
That is when bitcoin has a market capitalisation of US 1 trillion.
At US 1 trillion, it would be equivalent of Apple Inc in future.
But then Bitcoin should be bigger than Apple Inc, considering the fact that one day, the governments around the world starts to store bitcoins instead of Gold. All it takes is Russia govt start collecting bitcoins, China, USA, Germany also start fighting for bitcoins in order not to lose out. 
With this scenario pans out, with governments fighting for bitcoins with minions like us.
Bitcoins will be in the range of US100k to US150k. Eventually it will become US300k
per bitcoin upon maturity stage. 
All this forecasting base on fact that bitcoin continue to be unhackable, the technology remains relevant as a store of value. Security will be its single biggest issue for valuation. not scalability, adaptability, maintainabilty.
My 10 cents of thought, please comment and correct me, if you think i am off logic

He told me that there is 7 billion people on the planet. If one day, bitcoin becomes something that is important and everyone wish to owns one of it and there are only 21 millions bitcoins available. 
Then 1 bitcoin will be worth 1 million dollars
Bcos 7 billion divide by 21 millions equal to millions per bitcoin. Sort of make sense to me when i was at Starbucks listening to his presentation.
Then i asked him how many should i buy?
He replied 3. 1 for usage, 1 for keeping, 1 for selling to make profits. Heee
