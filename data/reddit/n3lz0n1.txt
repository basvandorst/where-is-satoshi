These bitcoin companies are all for show. Real companies are being overlooked. 
I know because I interned for a huge vc recently and looked at a company in the PH and they're actually doing big volume/profit but cannot raise because 
a) someone has been bad mouthing them and 
b) they're in a territory that SF VCs are not familiar with 
c) founders and the team have no startup/silicon valley contacts- but are actually well established entrepreneurs back in their country
It's a pity. I would have wanted to invest in them but I'm just at coffee making levels

let her discover bitcoin.
do the ff:
introduce the bitcoin paper wallet to her, explain the public and private address in layman's terms giving her example , bank account number = PUBLIC KEY , while her bank password = PRIVATE KEY
does she use smartphone? install a bitcoin wallet, something simple to use, Blockchain.info? send her some .01btc so she can practice, scan some QR code and ask her to send it back to you? :) 
then after understanding the bitcoin and blockchain and future techs about what it can do? then she makes a decision if she wants to invest money. :)  after doing my research (Univ Thesis) I did not stop following Bitcoin :)
sell her some bitcoin with a premium ;) kaching :-) 
then slowly tell her more about it, its a good time to spend time with your mom as well you know...she carried you for 8-9months?...we owe them big time :) 
good luck...

I have one, no problem with it, I keep most of my BTC in my trezor and use another wallet software for my day to day transactions :)

TA works as long as no bear/bull whale to  it... thats what I noticed when I start trading Bitcoins. its was too unpredictable sometimes.
it is run by manipulators... P&amp;D
