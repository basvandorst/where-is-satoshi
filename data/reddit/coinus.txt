How so? The profit motive is what ensures (or fails to ensure) an adequate supply of miners. For bitcoin it's working so far.
My question is about a different motive entirely, a government motivated to destroy bitcoin. Or more than one government, in collusion perhaps.

First, if the attackers don't have to attack by breaking the blockchain. Suppose they start just by demonstrating that an unknown entity has that kind of power, without doing anything nefarious just yet. It's big news. Unlike ghash.io, this new mysterious entity doesn't voluntarily remove the threat. Panic selling does a lot of the work for them.
Second, bricking the attackers (who haven't attacked yet, just shown that they could do so whenever they wanted) also bricks all of the existing 300 PH worth of minors out there. By the time they're willing roll over and die so a new incarnation of bitcoin can take over, it will be because there's so little left of bitcoin that they're willing to abandon their massive capital investments. Rolling out a new algorithm won't save the day.

[Nubits]( is another one. The mechanism for maintaining the peg is explained [in the white paper](

The devs can't "replace" the algorithm, all they can do is create a hard fork with a new algorithm on the new branch. And since the existing miners can't move to the new branch, they'll continuing to mine on the old branch unless bitcoin has collapsed so much that there's no longer any profit for them.
You end up with two coins claiming to be "the real bitcoin," and bitcoin (as we know it now) would be the one with orders of magnitude more hashpower backing it up, and the one that many merchants are still accepting to the extent bitcoin still had any value, etc. 
The core devs can publicize their new fork and plead with merchants and exchanges to switch over from accepting bitcoin as we know it to this new fork, etc., but it's going to be chaotic at best.  Definitely not the "few hours" you were saying earlier.

Apologies in advance if playing devil's advocate isn't welcome. The article says:


But they're assuming that miners are motivated by profit. What if the collapse of the system were the goal? 
Suppose it's the Chinese government that wants to do this. The electricity costs cited in the article are now not much of a factor. The chips are manufactured in China, and siphoning off a supply of the most recent technology is probably not hard for the government to arrange. 
How large an operation would they need to put together in order to pull it off?

The problems they're having have nothing to do with POW vs. POS/DPOS. It's because of their delegate system. Bad idea. 
For something with the good aspects of DPOS but without the delegate mess, look at [NXT's transparent forging]( Or just POS, which does't have the voting/delegate mess either.
