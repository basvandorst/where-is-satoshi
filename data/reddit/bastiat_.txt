What I don't get is the 39% of 'libertarians' in favor of 'not allowing' people to use Bitcoin.

I find that idiots laugh at all sorts of shit.

-_- 
Bitcoin isn't 'free speech?' And it's not 'real money?' 
Does this guy think we're all imbeciles? Who's he trying to convince?
The genie's out of the bottle. You can get butthurt about it, but it isn't going to disappear simply because it scares you.

Boss Tweed did good things. 
A classically liberal government will do better things.

So, you were there?

Bull. My bet is he's going to be saying its a neat little thing, but impractical and scary.
Go look what CNN has already said about Bitcoin. It's not like they just let their talking heads say whatever they want. CNN has an opinion of Bitcoin and it isn't like they've never talked about it. It's not going to be positive.

Tell that to CNN's viewers. They need to hear it. I mean, I'd really like to believe this is going to be positive or even neutralish... But I doubt it will end on a positive note.

He's just going to scare people away from bitcoin. He'll be like "Bitcoin is cool, but impractical and scary."
It's not like CNN hasn't made their opinion about Bitcoin known.
