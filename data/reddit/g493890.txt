I use bitrefill.com every month, great rates, great customer support and very reliable. No reason for me to leave and try this service from what I've seen. Bitrefill's only problem is they don't service CH (and some other countries) yet.

Me too. I've used Brawker for 6 transactions now, never had a problem, never heard of anyone having a problem. The service that did have a problem was purse.io and that was some time ago. If you can provide some evidence for your concerns about Brawker, do it.

So this happened to you or someone you know using Brawker? Do tell.
EDIT: Keep spending 5-16% more on everything you buy, trolls.

Non sequitur

Use Gyft. Brawker is not setup for things like gift cards, or low/fast moving inventory/shady merchants etc.

That is disappointing that that method didn't work. There might be other ways to get it done though, it's worth experimenting if you can save even a small percentage.

Bad answer, I agree. Could just be an off-hand customer service remark made by a person who is new to working there, or is overwhelmed, or something like that. 
I have learned some lessons with Brawker (and other things in the BTC ecosystem!) too-  it is certainly not perfect, but is still an excellent solution until merchants start taking BTC and offering discounts for it. They really need to 1) offer something like $10k of purchase insurance and 2) clarify what their system is good at and not so good at (gift cards obviously should be high on that list)
