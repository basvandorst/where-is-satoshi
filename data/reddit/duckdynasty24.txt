Realise that you're probably being hopelessly optimistic.
Answer this: Why *should* bitcoin hit 50k? Even if you believe in the technology, it's not going to hit 50k just because you want it to. 
If you believe in the tech, leave your BTC where it is and HODL. Don't even think about it and stop expecting to retire in the next 10 minutes.
If you don't, sell now and forget about it.

Even if true, not necessarily bullish. The price didn't increase on the news of other exchanges taking on BTC.

Yup, though this isn't per sale - this is your entire capital gains for the year. 
I can tell you from experience, if at all possible you should start keeping records of everything now - even if you're below the threshold if you ever do get questioned on it it'll make it much easier to prove later on, and if you do need to start paying tax it's a massive headache if you don't have the proper records to work out what you should be paying and to provide to HMRC should they ask.

Absolutely, and this is why I recommend buying high and selling low. Can't pay tax if you don't earn anything.

You pay capital gains tax on the gains you made on $1000 worth of bitcoin.
So let's say you buy $800 worth of Bitcoin. It then increases in value to be worth $1000. You then buy a TV with it. You would be liable to pay capital gains tax on the $200 gain you made.
To clarify, in many countries (such as the UK) there's a threshold before you pay any capital gains tax and I suspect the same is likely true in other countries but check with someone who actually is in a position to be advising you of tax law, such as an accountant.

And in most other countries as well. 
Saw someone claim the other day that you don't have to pay tax on bitcoin gains in the EU, linking some article about how VAT doesn't apply to bitcoin. This is not true. Yes, VAT does not apply but you absolutely still have to pay capital gains tax. This applies to every transaction where you have realised a gain, including buying a product or service using bitcoin that has increased in value since you purchased it.

To be fair I reckon it might be, at least in the short term. On HitBTC there's one hell of a buy wall there.

Ah excellent.
I should say as well that many countries do have reduced rate for gains made on a period of longer than a year. 
Also worth mentioning that some countries may tax you differently (i.e. as self employed rather than capital gains) if it's your main source of income, i.e. you're actively trading. This will likely increase your tax liability.

I just have the private key in a place where my loved ones will know where to find it. Hopefully they'll know what to do with it.

No, you are hodling if you own the asset. You're long if you've borrowed from the exchange to buy an amount, which you will then pay back with the gains you make later.

Well I mean, it's an awfully nice bag. Don't you think?
