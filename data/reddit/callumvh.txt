The only way to prove it is if he sends all 950BTC equally to everyone who upvoted and then we will all send it back, that way we will know it is real.

I feel like I should know the actor in the meme but I don't and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.

Sorry for the noob question but I sold high, how low will the price go in the despair phase? My guess is $1200, is that too high hopes?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:07:51
I was hoping for a much bigger drop, like $1300������

Just wondering, is is possible to have a socialism society with high taxes etc that uses bitcoin?
Or would the nationwide use of bitcoin reduce the total amount of tax that citizens pay?

So I need to know, Im guessing the price will go up but I have heard the it might first drop then rise, if it does rise do you think it will rise on the day or the day before or a week after, any opinions?
