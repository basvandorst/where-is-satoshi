What is this supposed to prove or say? Some of the wording makes fiat seem more reasonable and some is just plain misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:45:50
If people see it as having value it does. Fiat is a good example of this and so is gold and silver actually.

If you don’t want your bank account linked to an exchange try a bitcoin atm. Really high fees but better than .54 on the dollar. Usually under .15. They take cash

Paper might be good. I feel safer with paper because I can see it and it doesn’t touch the internet until I sweep the wallet. Good for long term.

Your exchange should have a history of price at the time of transaction

Taking into account different opinions is always good, no matter the subject or belief. I don’t think I should be getting down voted for suggesting it.

How are you able to get away with this? I might consider trying it..

Why on earth would you buy in with a credit card?
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:09:40
I think chances are high

It was meant to be a currency. That’s working out just great.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:58:57
It’s not a currency if you can’t make small purchases without paying 110% plus in fees.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:07:09
You can file for capital loss in each next quarter at the end of the year and you get some of it back.

Yes they do so they can manipulate it and smear crypto

What others have said but in basic economical terms: It raises the supply rather drastically, therefore with no substantial change in demand, price will go down.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:34:10
Basic percentages. If the price goes to 180% multiply your investment by 1.80
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:48:46
Not sure if it will immediately drop. It will likely be within hours but I’m also not convinced it would go to zero. Either way if the fall is slow enough a lot will be sold

There are currently two and a quarter BILLION tether right now and more is being made constantly. It’s worth being skeptical

People replying to you don’t know what they’re talking about. Also Capital Gains is on the honor system so if you only made one transaction and it was between cryptos, (unless you use coinbase), I would just wait until you cash out any or buy with it. Ask the people at that sub though
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:18:12
r/personalfinance is a lovely place

If you ever transfer a large profit back to your bank account to purchase something that doesn’t accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:33:11
Seems sketchy haha. Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:35:44
In the US Capital Gains must not be filed until you either sell or purchase something with bitcoin. If it’s a large gain be sure to pay ASAP, don’t wait for tax season to come around. r/personalfinance would be a good place to ask questions about the tax components of crypto. They know a lot more than I do over there.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:38:06
I’m looking to keep my bank out of it and I’m afraid I can’t do that with Coinbase or GDAX alone as far as I know. I also plan to make a larger purchase so hopefully the fee won’t be too bad. Thanks!

Also wealth gaps are not nearly as big of an issue as one would think. Third world nations that aren’t covered with terrorism are evolving with everyone else, just slower, and the top quintile can’t just magically give away half their wealth to speed it up
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:04:07
Worrying about the poor is just fine. However being irrational and driven completely by emotion will not help the poor nearly as much as true innovation and strong ideals

Saw someone say 5k by Feb 1st relating bitcoin to the “Pokemon GO phenomenon”

Gold has purpose. Just because we don’t know how much of it there is certainly doesn’t make it infinite. Not anyone can mine bitcoin it take lots of expensive equipment to do it. It’s much cheaper to pan for gold in a river somewhere. Your last point just doesn’t make any sense. If it belongs to that nation, then it’s theirs regardless of them sinking a ship, right? And if it’s from centuries ago, 1) how’d you find it anyway? 2) don’t tell the government about it..
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:04:03
Why is it common sense? Genuinely curious because my sense apparently isn’t very common. My thinking is, if anything, people will wait until the first because their rates will go down. If they’re below 28% their capital gains will decrease, too, right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:26:52
How can you so quickly abandon an investment when it has acted relatively normally considering the economic climate at the time. You’ve held for 5 years give it time, at least until the next crash.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:15:15
Excepting shtf scenarios, precious metals will always have value because they have tangible use for many things. Use in labs, jewelry, tech, etc. Using it as a currency will never really come back to fruition I’m sure but it’s value isn’t going anywhere
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:30:26
You realize fees will come down as it becomes cheaper to transfer, right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:44:09
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:19:59
I assume so. I wouldn’t risk being fined. Try asking in r/personalfinance
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:20:36
I’m saying if they cash out after (the first of january) many people will see lower rates, correct? And you still didn’t answer my question you just addressed my hypothesis
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:40:20
Thanks. I plan to verify a USD account with Coinbase and pay taxes and all that garbage, just don’t want my bank involved.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:08:30
Capital gains is mandatory, and since coinbase is required to report people to the IRS now certainly there will be a crackdown. If you get audited you’re fucked. There’s no way to “make it mandatory” as you say.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:42:28
Why is this good?
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:46:11
In what way? Because there’s an implication that it isn’t solely an investment?
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:50:59
Many times that could inaccessible in that situation, even with the internet necessary to buy crypto
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:52:24
Those numbers are so insane they look like a mistake at first read
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:39:16
Yes, I too have a hard time believing it’s reached such heights.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:02:42
Have you bought any back in the dip? At least your initial investment since you more than doubled it?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:09:41
I don’t mean for an investment take per se, just that if cryptocurrency truly does become the currency of the future it’d be nice to own some
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:33:09
Your problem was selling all of it to do that
