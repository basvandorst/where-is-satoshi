Best regards.

Is it even possible to buy anything on the Microsoft site yet? I was going to look into it, but it throws an error. Not that I have any bits anyhow, but I can't get the option to work.

You could not buy or sell. But, that seems counterproductive.

I'm assuming there's no way to set this up via WP8? I use the mobile app for 99% of my reddit browsing and was wondering if there's any way to add the suite through my phone.

Looks strikingly similar to the [ICE]( logo with a shopped Bitcoin logo over it... But, there's no way that OP would lie to us. So, this has to be legit.

I'm a newbie and I read the sidebar over there.------------&gt;Then, I found that since I'm in the US, coinbase was a good starting point.And finally, I did a search on various topics. (Cold wallet vs. Hot wallet, 2FA, how to secure my bitcoin, etc.)Then, I just kept reading through new topics as they pop up and searched some more. I still have yet to make a post like yours, because the search function has helped with everything.

Olaf, are there also delays currently in purchasing bitcoins? I have a transaction pending from yesterday morning and was curious if that's standard? I'm new to this and wasn't sure. Thanks!

How long does it usually take to get verified for coinbase? Are they pretty fast with doing their two small deposits? This is day two and I haven't seen them hit my bank account yet.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:23:55
I deposited on Oct. 30th, they've already withdrawn the cash, but my BTC still shows as pending. I'm assuming this is normal though with the influx of new users?

I'm not the OP, but had a quick question since I'm on mobile and can't see the sidebar.When you say Bitcoin address, is that the address that is a long string of numbers/letters that you create on a site like coinbase? I just signed up yesterday and created a address, but I'm not quite sure what to do with it? Would I integrate this into a payment button if I was a merchant?1Nk9F6giMYGyjdc8nW1Lpx4z96qx3gLhJK

Ah, great to know. Thanks!

Any way to add this multireddit on a mobile device? (WP8)

Riveting stuff.

Great, thank you for the insight! I've been reading up on it and it's a lot to cram in within a 24 hour slot. Wish I knew more back in 2009! Hadn't even heard of Bitcoin until the SR shutdown.

Wait, off 281? Near Mineral Wells/Stephenville?

I've set up my password on coinbase and also require them to text me an authorization code that I then have to input for access. Is that what you're referring to?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:18:02
The sidebar should have all the info you need to get started. You can buy partial coins on Coinbase, I recommend starting there.

I believe in bitcoin, but I also believe that in order for it to grow, there needs to be a way for people to be able to swipe it like a debit card and not have to worry about cold/hot storage.The average person doesn't want to have to set up a paper wallet, nor do they want to have to worry about private keys. When I tell someone about bitcoin, and how you can buy pretty much anything you need, no average person sees it as easier over swiping a debit card or using PayPal online. There are issues that need to be addressed (mandatory 2FA should be a thing everywhere). But, I think with how our world is, bitcoin has the potential to be huge and shake things up.

What types of items do you have made from wood? Or can you link me a site to check out? Something engraved does sound nice. I wanted either that or a nice handbag she could take on our honeymoon made out of leather and embroidered.Also, I'm in Texas.

Ok great, thanks for the info!

I bought an amazon gift card through Gyft, and then used it to buy [this 1TB Transcend hard drive]( because it's on sale right now and I needed one.

Ah I see, that makes sense. So it sounds like there really isn't a limit then on creating addresses? Currently, if a friend owes money and doesn't have any cash on them, I just have them PayPal me really quick.But, it sounds like generating an address for each individual would be the way to go... just need to get them to create a Bitcoin account.Edit: With that Bitcoin address, its only possible to pay to it and not withdrawal, correct?
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:41:50
In the US, is it fairly simple to withdrawal from coinbase? I'm just curious for later on, currently I've just been depositing.

As someone that just discovered this sub today, and is thinking of creating a BC account on my lunch break right now, do you have see any downfalls to BC?By creating an account, can I purchase a partial bitcoin to start? I can't see the sidebar on my cell and my windows phone formats the BC site horribly when I view their FAQ.

Which app do you use? I have a Lumia 920, but haven't found any apps with really high ratings.
