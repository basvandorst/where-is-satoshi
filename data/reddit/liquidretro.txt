I first backed up my wallet, I then updated my wallet and now its wanting to sync the entire blockchain again.  
I had used an MKlink command to move the pointers of the blockchain folder to a different drive to keep it off the limited space I have on my SSD following these directions.  
Any help?  I don't have enough space to let it sync then move it. Not to mention the time that would take.

I closed and restarted it and it seems fine.  It was definitely downloading the first time because my network was going crazy.

Call me a skeptic.....
1) Newsweek yesterday announced they were going back into print and guess what the cover story is. Bitcoin is a buzzword in the general public, but not something the average person knows much about. Ah lets pick this up and learn more. .  .
2) First paragraphs start with dialog with the police, who without anyone telling them A) Know what bitcoin is B) Know who the inventor is.  It almost sounds like they have done this before.
3) Very little details about how the reporter went through the "train parts supplier"
Poor guy regardless of if he is or is not the founder he will be getting a lot of attention that he doesn't want.  Publishing a photo of his house is simply not needed.

So all cryptocurrency apply I assume not just BTC.  
If we have to pay taxes as miners as if we are self employed, what can I deduct for now being self employed?

BTC were stolen but what about the other currency on the site? Any reason deposits were not working for those?

What is the benefits of using Electrum over the standard BTC QT client?
I like this guide and think it's recommendations is solid.  I would add that if your using a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive for one of your backup copies you should really add 2 factor authentication to your account to make that even more secure.
