Sorry if this is a noob question, but I logged into Localbitcoins and my receiving address still begins with a "1". As I understand it, this is not a segwit address. Plz halp. Thanks!

Oh I didn't know this. However, I'm probably not going to mess around with the Trezor private keys - I don't want to accidentally expose them. Thanks for making me aware of this though!
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:48:07
Upvoted for visibility.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:03:12
That would work if I had the private keys, which I don't because they're in the Trezor. Thanks for your post though, I'm sure someone will find it useful :)

Yes I just learned of this; however, I don't want to accidentally expose them.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:38:10
I completely agree, but at the same time, it's free money that I can't access.

Semi-related: Will there be any Trezor splitting tool for this?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:41:50
Hey thanks for that!

Don't you know that when *you* buy, the price goes down. Whenever I buy, it goes down.

My guess...
Buying the news:
* [CBOE to Begin Bitcoin Futures Trading December 10](
* [CME to launch bitcoin futures on December 18](

Wow, I like how when [OP originally posted these dashboards]( (13 days ago) BTC was at $5K, and now it is at $9K.
Also, thanks for delivering - OP! You're awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:28:59
I think you should just buy more now.

Sorry, Graphite noob here. Could you perhaps point me in the right direction for how you "drop" the raw values into Graphite? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:38:02
I am aware.

Have you received any confirmations yet? I've been waiting over two hours with 0 confirmations as well.
EDIT: No worries, it took roughly 2 and a half hours for the first confirmation.

Bithumb is back online.

Wow, thanks! OP delivers :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:43:24
Hey, thanks so much! That helps a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:44:09
Thanks for your response! I'll keep it for reference for when I get around to playing with this stuff. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:51:33
I trust that the private key... Isn't a copy... I hope it's not a copy.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:28:17
That'll do pig, that'll do.
