It's in bitfinex's best interest to try and resume operations at one point, or at least attempt to do so,  so yes I do believe we will be getting our 64% back. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:29:35
exactly. not sure why people are complaining lol
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:50:36
do not be selfish. this is the best way for everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:14:14
A buyout and repayment in full would be nice for sure, but a 36% haircut for all with slow repayment of the rest is definitely enough to make everyone happy (or most people who can see the possible outcomes here given the circumstances)
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:42:01
"the whole point of exchanging assets on an exchange is pointless" 
That makes no sense and it sounds like you were one of those other assets people which explains your biased opinion. However you are wrong. If you had anything at all on the exchange, then you had equal risk as the people who had BTC. I suggest you change your mind and accept the haircut of 36% before none of us end up getting anything back at all. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:09:29
You shouldn't have expected anything back. Be grateful were all going to be made whole. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:07:13
Keep dreaming, this will not happen. Unfortunately because of all the short-sighted, selfish people who had USD only on Bitfinex, that think bitcoin holders should take the entire hit, I Believe this entire thing will result in BFX bankruptcy with little to no funds of any kind given to anybody. Socialized losses would be the best outcome. Or some sort of miraculous refund of all funds which is very very unlikely. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:59:22
yes i agree with this. hopefully that is what they do
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:23:19
PLEASE DO NOT change the proposed hair cut. The majority of us are okay with it and have accepted it, even large USD holders. Hence [this]( post, which has been on the front page of reddit with 200+ upvotes.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:35:25
OH i see. In that case yes, of course the article is wrong :) 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:18:12
And while you would be happy thinking you would get 100% of your USD, the outcome of that scenario IMO would be that since bitcoiners/USD lenders would be expected to receive less than 40% of their funds, more customers would be inclined to file lawsuits and then if they went bankrupt, all withdrawals would be frozen and we would ALL receive crumbs in some years (yes, including you.)
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:02:09
STOP with this selfishness! WE ALL had funds on bitfinex. Therefore we should all split some of the loss. Just because you *think* your USD are safe and you will be fine, you are willing to say the people who had bitcoin deserve to take 100% of the hit? Well let me tell you something... If that does end up being the case, one or many of those bitcoiners that lost funds will seek legal action and will file an injunction before any of you can withdraw anything, which will then lead to bankruptcy of bitfinex. That means little to no funds for ANYONE. STOP BEING SO SELFISH!
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:19:52
He also said repeatedly that nothing was official. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:54:06
That is not happening. Sorry! Because all the eth/etc/ltc holders should also have taken responsibility for keeping their coins in their own wallet. Your argument is extremely poor. Embrace the haircut like the rest of us!
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:32:39
Well put. have an up vote!
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:17:21
its unofficial so obviously zane cannot confirm anything.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:29:18
Can't believe people are still complaining this much. Most people would call this GOOD NEWS given the circumstances
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:24:29
And you can stop posting 50 identical threads that nobody wants to read.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:57:43
we do all get a 34% haircut. The only people excused from the haircut are those who deposited btc after the hack. Those deposits will not be cut
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:43:37
and plans to compensate those who were "affected" ? Will that also be announced? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:40:02
I am reporting your posts for spam. And i will down vote. The haircut + bfx token solution is a solution the majority of bitfinex users are happy with if they follow through with it as promised
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:35:45
this is actually a bail in by definition. BTC would never bail out anyone by forking. So yes, ETH is still a bail out shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:19:43
It sucks, but getting paid back in full slowly is better than getting a much smaller percentage from a law suit after many years. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:36:13
so if the btc in my regular deposit address were moved, that doesn't necessarily mean i was affected?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:30:42
i dont know where to find that?? is that the deposit address
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:24:41
is bitfinex moving any funds? i checked my deposit addresses and the btc were moved out of that address to a new address around 9:00 blockchain time.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:03:54
If they pay the users back in full, people will continue to use it. Just probably with much less coin on the exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:26:26
I really think this seems to be the case. I too have noticed the people yelling for law suits and bankruptcy are the ones with no money on BFX at all.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:35:18
no i am reporting you for spam because of the 10 identical posts you have made in the past few hours. and you can look around reddit, and also see [this]( thread. 100+ upvotes and front page of . clearly the community has spoken on this subject.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:43:35
this is what they plan to do. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:59:23
Did you have something at risk in the exchange? Yes we all did. Stop being selfish and just be happy there's a chance everyone gets everything back 
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:33:34
These are questions he does not have the answers to at this time from my understanding. I agree it sucks, but it's definitely a possibility 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:27:57
I plan to take the same course of action if Bitfinex thinks they can just let "affected" users take the loss. 
If they have any plan to reopen in the future and keep any trust with their current customer base, I'm sure they know the only option they have is finding a way to make EVERYBODY whole again. But like you have said, based on the wording thus far, that doesn't seem to be the case. 
Here's to hoping they smarten up and make the right decision. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:13:36
I was not "born a gullible retard who thinks everything will be OK"  
But you saying "I KNEW you were going to DIP INTO ETC and ETH ACCOUNTS HOLDERS." just goes to show that you thought you would be getting 100% of your eth/etc and everyone else would be taking the loss. This was never going to be the outcome because if it did more people would be inclined to sue. So I guess you are the gullible retard who is also delusional. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:46:32
Biggest thefts in world history? Doesn't even come close lol... Bitcoin history? Sure.
I'm assuming you had nothing at risk on BFX based on your careless comment. The reality is this:
There are two roads still open. One is taking the haircut and possible bail-in or credit notes, the other inevitably leads to a Gox style liquidation for the remainder of the decade. Gox was a clear-cut case compared to this and after 3 years, plus tens of millions in expenses they are yet to see a dime. The options are getting about ~2/3rds of your assets now, with the possibility of recovering the rest, or getting back less around 2020-2021. Even if you'd be sure to get a better deal with a liquidation, which I don't see happening, the time value on your money makes the Gox option unattractive.
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:09:45
This is not an "upvote bot". Just because your dumb suggestions get downvotes and the logical suggestions get up votes means they are being vote botted? LOL at your logic.
maybe you should deal with the reality. We are getting a haircut. Now stop crying.
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:08:42
this is the fairest way. you will get your 2 bitcoins back eventually dont worry. Bitfinex plans to make everyone whole again. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:42:14
Hi hacker, congratulations on your Jackpot. Lost A LOT due to your heist, but I am thankful I didn't lose everything so I will be ok. Enjoy it! Here is my btc address and thanks for doing this.
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:29:59
let's wait to hear bitfinex's proposal. They have a plan to pay users back in full over time. The socialized loss would just be up front payment.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:28:49
look again :P now there is an official update.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:17:09
Paying one group of your customers and having a small group of customers take the entire loss is much worse and definitely illegal. This is also what their legal counsel advised them to do. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:08:11
I don't know. I just want my money. :( 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:10:32
i've withdrawn from both polo and kraken in the past 3-4 hrs. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:29:07
before you do that, let's wait to hear bitfinex's proposal. They have a plan to pay users back in full over time. The socialized loss would just be up front payment.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:34:31
The other night he said there was an update coming out for sure and then never posted it until the morning. Relax. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:40:38
no as in theres a chance im all good? lol
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:30:41
If they go back to the cold storage way of storing btc, and pay all customers back, I'm sure many people will use their exchange again.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:00:24
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:38:46
I would assume everyone will be getting that % haircut based on the currency they had at the time. However nothing has been officially announced regarding that. I'm sure we will know soon
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:25:13
This is the best way to go about this. Many including myself support Bitfinex's decision to socialize losses. It is also what their legal counsel advised them to do.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:28:29
We all had equal risk by keeping assets on the exchange and this is definitely the best way to resolve this. If they made only btc holders take a 70% haircut then they would be most likely served with an injunction and then all the people with usd/eth that thought they would be ok would end up getting nothing because all withdrawals would be frozen. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:12:49
me too :( 200+ btc lost. but maybe bitfinex will make it right and pay us back in full. I'm sure they are working on a plan
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:46:03
this is not true at all. If they go this route, an injunction then possibly leading to bankruptcy may result in nothing returned or close to nothing returned. This is likely to be the result if people like you, (USD Balance BFX users) continue to try and say a haircut/socialized loss is a bad idea. Everybody will end up with very little, if anything. Extremely selfish suggestions like yours will really result in NOTHING returned.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:07:14
is bitfinex moving any funds? i checked my deposit addresses and the btc were moved out of that address to a new address around 9:00 blockchain time.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:15:19
As long as everyone gets paid I don't see the big deal in using bitfinex in the future. They plan to pay everyone back in full at some point.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:31:19
I agree. The compensation plan is a no brainer. And its funny because the few people left that still try and say law suits etc are the way to go are the ones with no money at all in Bitfinex so their opinion doesn't even matter in the end
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:57:37
"unlike risky btc holdings" if you keep anything on an exchange it is "risky" This is the best outcome. Be grateful.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:09:27
Nobody is with you. Given the circumstances this is the best outcome. Stop being selfish and be happy we will all be getting the majority of our money back. (hopefully)
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:43:23
Yes...its common sense at this point. I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks a law suit is a better alternative anymore. Those people are either trolls or had nothing at risk on the exchange and don't care (their opinions don't matter)
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:04:34
How would you like to get nothing at all? I suggest you calm down and be grateful for this outcome given the circumstances. Stop being an Idiot.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:48:10
losses up to 70% per user up front, but over time they plan to pay everyone back via dividends or something like that hopefully. Yes, I agree it is a shitty scenario but it's better than nothing at all.
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:09:43
Exactly. op should read this
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:45:08
Yes I have heard many good things about shift as well. Have not tried it myself however. Hope it works out :)
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:28:29
use Xapo 
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:15:47
Fewer and fewer people want bitcoins?.....
 Actually it's the opposite.  I would say over 70% of the people selling their bitcoin are only selling it in hopes of buying it back at a lower price. That way they can try to get MORE bitcoin with the same amount of fiat. 
Bottom line is everybody wants more bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-30 07:49:20
or is it just a little dump before the reallll halving pump?
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:11:35
this is too low fee. you should try sending .0005 when the network is bakced up a bit like this
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:24:53
what dump? i think we just hit 500$ on bitfinex!(and almost 530$ on china exchanges)
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:11:02
Trezor is worth it
@_date: 2016-05-30 07:50:16
hahaha :D
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:52:10
trezor is the most reliable IMO.
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:53:53
that's called a failed dump :)
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:46:20
horrible advice
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:50:19
I think the point is that with bitcoin things like this would never happen. People should not be able to steal identities and spend other people's money this easily...yet it happens on a daily basis. Sounds like a flaw to me...wouldn't you say so?
