I think u/mitchr4 is a seasoned trader himself with 60k ready on bitstamp who wants to scare some people so he can buy their cheap coins.....
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:54:24
That I agree. We have a tendency to blow things out of proportion. That's why we have these huge fluctuations in price still. We need to keep reporting on how stamp is doing.

I am trying to promote Bitcoin in Africa. We are including some wallet functionality in php websites but it doesn't scale very well. I heard node.js could be the solution but we have no experience in it. If you could create some wallet functionality in node.js that we can interface with from php that would be of enormous help.

I feel for you man. Sorry
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:07:06
You ok?

Guys, there was a problem with the closing time of the bet. Here is the extended one:

Odds are against Manny Pacquiao 0.01BTC can give you 0.03395BTC thats 240% ROI

Ok this will make our break your rep

This sounds like the recipe that was used to create Fidor bank.  They were very community focused. Facilitated peer to peer. Basically did all through partners, just provided the platform and customers for others to innovate on. They were very bitcoin friendly and it was easy to go in and out of bitcoin because of their banking license. However when a challenger bank get successful they get acquired which is what happened to Fidor. All of a sudden the CEO starts talking about blockchain rather than bitcoin. And introduce ripple. Big shame as it had good potential. See

Which protocol is used in the current internet?

Don't think the Greek government believe that this is the final deadline otherwise they would have come with concrete proposals to Brussels.

Here is a good article:

Don't be scared. That's what they want you to be. They want you to sell now and they will buy back from you. You bought your first bitcoin. Trust me you are still one of the first in the whole world. Enjoy to be part of something truly transformational. Keep your nerve and look back at it in two years time. I am pretty sure it will be above $490 significantly. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:33:02
They will only have lost money if they sold. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 09:28:25
The whole point is that we have created scarcity by saying there will be never more than 21m coins produced. Now let's say all coins get lost and there is only 1BTC left. The system could still work by sub dividing (e.g. adding more decimals).

Why I didn't get your tip?

Blockchain shares. I love them.

How about Rwanda?

Ok but how do the central ledgers get checked. For example let's say if I transfer money from bank a to bank b and it goes via bank c. Could two banks collude and change the ledger?

I think your idea is good but what I love most is how you are thinking to help spread bitcoin to more people. That will be the key to its success and if it happens we will all benefit. You say you are a Web developer so please just start. You can optimise/adapt your idea along the way. Having an idea is ready. The only way you can have an impact is by doing. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:56:57
That's very kind of you. ..
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:56:57
It works!! This is so cool. Thank you!
