How do u guys make money?

They expect people to pay for all the  videos they watch? Itd be better if they were free with the option to tip or subscribe patreon style to content creators.

How is Javascript inherently insecure? Can't librejs be fine?

Could you post pictures on this setup? Sounds fascinating

i keep telling digital ocean this but they don't listen. even if you change to using an authenticator app they allow you to disable all 2fa with a code sent to your phone number which they force you to setup to enable 2fa via an app

Except they can shut it down if they invest a tiny tiny proportion of their budget for hardware to take 51% and then the same hardware for any other PoW coin that bothers them

Digital Ocean forces you to have a phone number associated withour 2FA with a convenient button in the login screen to completely disable 2FA with a text message even if you change to using an authenticator app...
Ive been telling them to fix this and they just link me to a 2013 uservoice page of people asking them to remove this...

Why do they disagree with RBF?

Can you explain why this is bad? I use electrum and am worried 
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:42:21
I think minergate does that. They do take a fee though

Aragon, akasha, golem and storj are all reslly good smart contracts for users. Prism is also interesting for traders. And using eth is a fast currency with small fees (which is what I used to say about Bitcoin but sadly cant anymore) 
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:02:25
What are btc's use cases? There's nothing i can explain to people on why they would want it anymore.
