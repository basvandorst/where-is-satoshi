My suggestion is as follows:
MtGox starts an IPO of 500 million dollars, and increases the share amount so Mark Karpeles only owns 1% of the company after the IPO.
The money you pay for the shares goes directly to the company, not to Mark.
500 million should be more than enough to cover:
-settle clients at bitcoin price of $500
-hire developers
-buy professional exchange system and back office from wall street technology firms
Company gets listed at Nasdaq and you sell your shares for a profit in a couple of years if you wish.

I would not be surprised if Facebook buys MtGox, they paid 19 billions for a simple chat app (WhatsApp). They could easily pay 1 billion for MtGox plus 500 million dollars to settle the missing 750,000 bitcoins in their books.

I think this might be the most fair option, but it could probably only be applied to verified clients since a share must have a known owner.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:09:47
Another option is to make all clients shareholders automatically, based on how much money and bitcoins they have in their accounts.

Why should you as an investor save MtGox?
1. Save MtGox to protect the faith in bitcoin
2. Protect the privacy and data of the customers, if the company goes bankrupt the highest bidder might be a criminal who wants to scam people in the customer database.
3. To make money! If MtGox is saved and run by a proper management, it will fluorish with 1+ million clients. It's market value would go from 500 M to sevaral billions within a year.

You should never print out a paper wallet on a shared printer at the office, school or internet cafe. 
And you should connect the printer with USB to your PC. Infected PC's in your network could possibly copy the page that is sent to the printer if the printer is connected to the LAN.

The trademark of bitcoin is generic and should be revoked.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:28:19
Yes we should save it to save the confidence in bitcoin, it would be a tragedy if 127 000 people lost their money and confidence, which also is a bad PR for bitcoin / cryptos.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:30:32
Yes, MtGox is too big to fail for us bitcoiners. it would hurt the confidence in bitcoin although this has nothing to do with the currency itself.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:12:11
Yes, but nobody forces you to invest in MtGox shares. But I would. I have bitcoins there and I would particpate to save MtGox.

BTC-e seems shady, who are you going to sue if they take your money and coins?

We have no evidence that he robbed his clients, but we can for sure say the bankrupcy is the result of bad management. It is clear  he knew about the missing coins for a long time without telling his clients, something, it was his duty to inform us about this important fact.

You don't know anything about business.
You buy something when everybody hates it (Apple year 2002), and sell it when everybody loves it (Apple year 2012)
This is also true for MtGox, now everybody hates it. But they forget that the company got 500K-1M verified clients, that customer base is worth a lot for a proper management that knows how to run an exchange.

The first time Bitcoin had a huge rally was 2011, then it crashed 95%.
This time it might crash "only" 70-80% since bitcoin got a broader userbase than it had two years ago. But on the longer term I believe bitcoin could trade at parity with one ounce of gold - if we assume that bitcoin will replace PayPal for online payments. 
Strategy: Short EBAY now, and Long BitCoin on dip anywhere between 20-30$

It's an irony that the official forum of a decentralized currency is centralized and so easy to hack / DDOS. We need to have a decentralized forum, as an encrypted torrent storing content and user information.

The solution is not to change to another small exchange - the only long term solution is to create one decentralized p2p bitcoin exchange, and change the role of the current exchanges to brokers so they all can place orders in one huge worldwide orderbook.

Speculation: If BTC drops below 200$ today and fails to trade above 200$ the following days a bigger correction towards at least 100$ is on the way. A crash towards 30-50$ would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:06:56
The same way stock brokers do it: they find shares in the market that you borrow and sell. When you want to exit the trade you buy back bitcoins on the market. And when you want to buy on margin your broker lends you money to buy bitcoins and you pay interest on that money. 
Naked short selling should not be implemented (selling bitcoins that dont exist) since it would create even greater volatility than we have today.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:23:26
Please participate in the discussions on creating a p2p based BTCUSD exchange! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:38
Short selling should not be implemented at exchange level - that would require the exchange to trust the brokers to have margin in the event that the shorted bitcoin price would go up  significantly, leading to huge losses that must be settled against other brokers. That would lead to bankrupcies and destroyed faith in the exchange. Conclusion - no, short selling should be implemented at broker level, not at exchange level so it dont affect clients at other firms.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:37:28
Yes, people are talking about this a lot - if the community can agree on the architecture of the system I believe we could have a running decentralized exchange within a year.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:19:25
The bitcoin community are discussing a p2p based exchange-broker model for the bitcoin market. When we launch this system hackers can forget about DDOS-attacks and flooding. They may shutdown some brokers but they will never be able to shutdown the p2p exchange where orders are matched!

The price of bitcoin is a bubble at this levels so it will crash anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:02:38
As I said: if it drops more than 20-30% it means the uptrend is broken.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:59:22
We at bitcointalk are developing a p2p exchange for bitcoin that is open source. Please contribute to the discussion at:

Bitcoin crashed hard - low was 135 at Gox = 50% down from ATH of 266. 
I expect this down trend to continue. But dead cat bounce is of course part of the game, we might get a fake rally to 200$ that fails and goes down again sharply.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:09:34
Humanity is the biggest bubble of them all. When our bubble crash 95% of the population will be gone. But that is another discussion.

Correlation between google trends search on "bitcoin" and the mtgox price of bitcoin seems diverge - price goes up while search volumes is going down. 
This blog article is from 2011, but the analysis can always be applied - the conclusion: big selloff follows later on when search volume drops.

This crash is the best thing that could happen to bitcoin! 
The greedy speculators that just want to make a quick profit will be shaken out and get tired of bitcoin. During the "bear market" of bitcoin the real enthusiasts and entrepreneurs will build a better and stronger foundation for the bitcoin infrastructure and echosystem. We will be back stronger than ever in a couple of years - Til then: we must build a decentralized exchange that makes the trading with bitcoin more secure and more stable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:31:32
You should at least take home your intial dollar investment plus some profit so you dont feel like a loser if bitcoin would crash down to 20$.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:07:38
Everyone is so greedy now. dont forget that almost 11 million coins are already is mined. The day the trend turns down it will probably drop 50% the first day and up to 90% within weeks. Remember that bitcoin is not EurUsd or S&amp;P 500, there are no market makers or governments saving the market from crashing. We are on our own here in the bitcoin wild west.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:27:43
We will not encourage HFT-trading in the p2p-exchange - there will be auctions every period of X seconds where orders are matched randomly based on price and quantity. The order matching will be made the same way as bitcoin mining - distributed computing. No one can manipulate the order book or place his trading server close to the exchange server to get benefits.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:17:11
The bitcoin community is going to build a decentralized exchange so we dont have to suffer because of one site going down.
My idea of a p2p exchange is basically this:
-Exchange must be 100% decentralized and open source
-Fees are rewarded to miners sharing their computing power for the exchange
-Anyone can become a broker, but naturally some brokers will become big since many people trust them
-Clients trust the brokers to settle the bitcoins, dollars or gold coins or whatever they trade ( asset X against asset Y )
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:54:26
When we trade bitcoin for dollars we play Fed:s game, I didnt expect anything else but potential market manipulation. But lets not focus too much on them. Right now we must build the infrastructure of bitcoin and that is: a decentralized exchange plus trustworthy brokers around the world participating as members in this open source exchange!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:32:33
Whatever you do, make a plan and follow it so you are prepared for all outcomes. BTC might go to 0,20,50 or it might bounce up here and go to 1000. Who knows? We are all fooled by randomness - but with good plans we can become successfool fools :)
