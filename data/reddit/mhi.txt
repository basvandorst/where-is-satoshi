When you copy bitcoin, it will always be only a copy of bitcoin. The coins will not mix with the original bitcoin, they are not interchangeable. When you print fiat, the new money will mix with the old fiat and therefore reduce the value of each individual unit.

Maybe I misunderstood your setup.
Trading itself has to be fast because trades typically are based on previous trades. Because of that, trading systems are typically based on simple databases with an entry for each trade. There are no real transactions involved.
Managing the funds of the users including settling of trades is done separately. The exchange has to make sure it has control over enough funds of the user to successfully settle all trades of the user. If the user account is a LN endpoint, settling can only be done when the user (or whoever controls the second endpoint of the channel) is connected and does agree to the transactions made. That makes it more difficult and risky for the exchange. They will want you to "pay" bitcoin before placing a sell order so that you can't prevent settling. If the order gets cancelled they have to pay you your coins back. That introduces an additional level of settling which makes all more complicated.
Because of that, exchanges will more likely offer trading as they do today and they will maybe offer LN services separately by providing an additional account to the user. The user can use the LN account for his own LN transactions and there will be a possibility to transfer funds from the LN account to the separate trading account and back. That can be LN transactions and you cannot use the funds on the trading account for anything else than trading.
As your LN account needs a second endpoint and you have to be that second endpoint, the exchange can only earn LN fees if you make or route LN transactions. If you are not the second endpoint, you wouldn't recognise what the exchange is doing with your funds anyway. But it would be risky for the exchange to use your funds for own LN channels and not moving them to cold storage. The money is customer funds and has to be protected very carefully. You would have to agree that the exchange does something with your money (and maybe pays you for that). But that isn't really related to the exchange business anymore. It's a completely separate business and the only link is the possibility to move funds between the trading and the LN account (which technically can be done the same way between two completely different companies if using standardized LN transactions for that).
The trading account isn't a real LN channel endpoint in this setup. It's only an account in a customer database.

Every dollar that goes into an alt, doesn't go into bitcoin. But in the long term, most of the alts will fail as people learn and see the differences in all that cryptos and that specific cryptos don't have a future if there don't fulfill another use case than speculation. Investing in bitcoin in the beginning was like investing in a completely new idea of money. And compared to other cryptos, bitcoin has and is expected to have the most practical use in the future by being accepted and used in real economy. Today there is also a lot of speculation in bitcoin but bitcoin will still have value when this speculation stops while many other cryptocurrencies won't. A lot of them are dying already or never came to life really. It's comparable to the evolution theory in nature: Good developments will survive and get better while other will die. In the end there will only be the really good ones (and we don't know, if bitcoin will be one of those, but chances seem to be good as of today).
Maybe those alts are good for bitcoin because they keep away some speculation from it. That can help reducing the negative effect on bitcoin price if speculation on cryptocurrencies goes down.

Different cryptocurrencies are compareable to different fiat systems. You can create as many as you want and everyone has it's own value. Some have very special features that others don't have, so it makes sense that they exist. You can convert between the different systems (crypto and fiat) through exchanges. Conversion rates are usually not fixed and represent the different value that is given to the different systems.
One special feature of many cryptocurrencies is that there is an upper limit for the number of tokens that exist. If you have 1% of all the tokens, you will always have 1% as no one can create new ones of that particular cryptocurrency. That isn't true for fiat currencies: If you have 1% of all units today, that won't be true tomorrow even if you don't sell/spent yours.
Of course an upper limit doesn't guarantee a value. If people start to see less value in Bitcoin (which is more probable when there are more alternatives), conversion rates to other currencies will reflect that change.
Bitcoin (and many other cryptocurrencies) are special in the way: If you have X% of 21,000,000 of them, you will have that X% as long as YOU want and therefore you will own X% of the value of the whole network. In fiat currencies that X will decrease towards zero over time, in Bitcoin it won't.

There can be an unlimited number of bitcoin copies. But value doesn't come with it automatically. People have to believe that a specific version of bitcoin has any value. A copy of bitcoin, that only a handful of people use, has no value. Adoption around the world and in real economy is what makes any alternative version of bitcoin valueable. And that is far more difficult to archieve than creating another copy of bitcoin (which in fact can be and has been an automated process everyone could do).
If i want to make a copy of bitcoin and call it "m-hi-coin" I could do so very easily but no one would care about it, so it wouldn't have any value. In fact, when you copy the proof of work logic from bitcoin you need a minimum level of adoption or otherwise your coin won't be secure against attacks (you need enough hashrate to prevent so called 51% attacks).
Some copy the code for their own coin and try to give it value by adding new features that original bitcoin doesn't have.

For a LN payment, both channel partners have to be online (connected). The exchange couldn't do anything without you. That would be a problem because you couldn't place a limit order and go offline.
Possible solution: The exchange could "remove" the funds as soon as you place an order and refund you, if you cancel your order at a later time. That means, you pay when your order is placed and not when your order is executed.

Your lightning wallet keeps track of your payments. You never need to close your channel, there is no maximum time frame for an open channel. I can open a channel to a payment provider and use this channel over years to pay for things and refill the channel monthly with fiat.
You only need to close the channel when you want your coins back to your classic wallet for example to do a classic bitcoin transaction with these coins.
And the channel can get closed if your channel partner decides to close it.

Maybe storing a sheet of paper securely isn't that easy for everyone but for me it's very easy and much more secure than storing the seed on a PC or online (unprotected or scrambled in any way).
When you choose an algorithm to scramble your seed words, that algorithm can be cracked. If a hacker gets your words and identifies them as seed, it's quite easy to crack that. To get full benefit of the security of possible combinations of the order of your seed words, you would have to sort them randomly. And in that case you also need to back up the order of the words somewhere.
For me, the additional attack vector is giving a hacker the chance to get my seed information remote while a sheet of paper at least needs physical presence for being able to get stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:25:59

But then there is no point in using LN anymore. When one entity controls all keys, they can just use a private ledger like exchanges do today. And you can't "share" the keys because you couldn't make sure to always work on the latest state of the channel (risking loss of your funds). So, you even couldn't benefit from being a "shared LN node".

In reality, exchanges don't manage the private keys on behalf of the users. You make a deposit to a address but after then, funds are moved to exchange addresses that are not linked to individual user accounts anymore. Your balance is managed only with classic databases.
Managing user funds in "hosted" channels wouldn't be something that fits to the business of an exchange. It would be something that fits to the business of an online wallet service. So, there are two businesses involved: an exchange business and an online wallet business. While the online wallet can offer hosted LN channels, the exchange won't. But you can move your funds between these two businesses. That businesses can be offered by one company or two different companies. The exchange would have to change how deposit addresses work, but thats not a big deal. Deposits done via LN can be used for LN withdrawals requested by any user because it's not a hosted channel for a specific user but a single big channel between the online wallet provider and the exchange. Channel balancing can be done using regular bitcoin transactions between online wallet provider and exchange.
So, hosted channels would be something that online wallet providers will offer but not exchanges. Of course, both services can be offered by one company within one user interface. And they could try to put all this in a "black box" so that it looks like an exchange account with a hosted LN endpoint to the user if the exchange gets enough control over the user funds during trading (eg. by locking funds needed for sell orders on the exchange) and implementing automatic fund transfer between wallet account and trading account so that the trading account only has a balance between trade execution and trade settling.
To earn additional fees, exchanges can try to use their LN channels (which are not user specific) for LN transaction routing. Online wallet providers can use hosted user LN channels for that only if the user has hosted more than one channel and agreed to using them for transaction forwarding because it will influence the balance on the channels.

Offline usually means, the computer doesn't know the private key until you want to spend. In that case it doesn't matter how you secure your PC or wallet because accessing the coins is simply not possible. It's important to have a secure PC as soon as you enter the private key to make a transaction.
If you mean, you store your bitcoin local instead of online at a wallet provider, than securing your wallet is important because access to your wallet means access to your bitcoin at any time. Only if you never connect your PC to the internet you don't need 2FA.

The seed is great to be stored on paper but I would never store it in a file--especially on a medium thats connected to the hardware that is used to make transactions. You can use a USB stick but a sheet of paper does the same job and can't fail electronically. Write the seed on a few sheets of paper and store them safely in different locations. You only need it to recover your wallet after failure (eg. hard drive crash).
As long as you don't want to spend but only hold, a paper wallet is also fine and gives the same security as a seed written to a sheet of paper in combination with a hardware wallet. Also for a paper wallet you should make  a few copies and store them securely in different locations if possible.

Yes, all other transactions won't hit the blockchain. Only the channel opening transaction and the closing transaction will ever be included in the blockchain. All transactions in between are only stored on one of the two nodes that form the channel (some on the first node and some on the other).
Of course it is absolutely ok to store all transactions of the channel on both nodes or in addition somewhere else to protect against data loss (eg. a third party server). Thats ok because the transactions are not completely signed. Once they are signed they could be included in the blockchain and implicitly close the channel that way.
I expect increased privacy because most transactions are not on the public blockchain. And I expect specialization of nodes: hubs with high amount of bitcoin on the channels, many channels and 24/7 uptime and personal clients with only one or a few channels with few bitcoin on them and not 24/7 uptime. Hub providers and third parties will offer additional services like backup of unsigned transactions ("channel backup/restore") and watching the blockchain for channel closing transactions.

Yes, with time replay attacks get less probable. There will be newly mined coins, which only exist on one ledger and people will split their coins to different addresses on each ledger so that every address is only valid on one chain. But risk for old addresses will stay forever or at least until the coins are moved in a safe way.

A solution would be a stop limit order. The triggering price defines the price that has to be reached to place the order and the limit price is the minimal accepted trading price. The order will not be executed below the limit price but the risk is that the order will never be executed if price does never rebound above the limit price.
And I don't know which exchanges offer stop limit orders.
That is quite the same as a limit order with the difference, that you don't have to place the order manually but the exchange will place your order automatically as soon as the triggering price is reached.

2) Sync didn't work or hasn't finished.

You have a transaction of your channel representing the current state. You can use that to close your channel on both chains separately (which would be the safest way because it prevents a replay attack). Or you could close the channel on one chain while continuing to use your channel on the other chain. So, in fact, LN channels are duplicated during the fork as well (with their latest state).
A problem can occur, if the hardfork changes the format of the transactions (eg. to implement replay protection). In that case your channel transactions maybe won't be usable on the new chain. Then you should close the channel before the fork or you have to trust your channel partner to close the unwanted chain channel cooperatively by creating a new closing transaction with you.
Or you spend all coins on the channel, then it's not your problem anymore.

The nodes knowing the original transaction would never have shown the new one because they recognize it as double spend. Maybe he was able to hide the original transaction from that block explorer or it was dropped from the mempool on its node. This could also happen by accident. Tell him that the transaction he sent to you isn't confirmed and will never confirm because the inputs aren't valid. He should be able to find out where the coins really went by analysing the receiving address of the double spending transaction linked on that site:

A stop loss order is a market order (not a limit order) that is placed as soon as a certain price is reached. It is executed at the next price that allows the trade. So if there are a lot of stop loss orders, price will go far below the triggering price to fulfill the neccessary volume for all those orders.
If it was a limit order there would be a high possibility that the order isn't executed at all, especially when the price keeps declining. So that wouldn't fit the idea behind a stop loss order.

There is no "the mempool" as every node can decide which transactions should be saved. Older nodes wipe the mempool when restarted.

Mycelium doesn't support such coins. Ledger doesn't support importing keys. You should move your BTC to your ledger using Mycelium or another wallet software and then a wallet software that supports the other coin to import the key there and send the other coin to an exchange (or to your ledger if you want to keep them). But don't mix up receiving addresses of different coins. Ledger would have different addresses for different coins.

If the attacker was able to get your seed (as you suspect) he doesn't need to log into your account, so you wouldn't get any notifications. The attacker could restore the private keys on any other compatible wallet software on his own PC and move the funds from there.

Yes. You can close a channel anytime without consent - except on a forked chain, that introduces a new transaction format. If it's prepared carefully, maybe you can get a new transaction in the new format before the fork if LN software gets this feature. Then you would be safe during and after the fork without needing to close the channel.
That means: LN software should give you two transactions representing the current channel state (one for each chain) before the fork. And if it doesn't in time, close the channel before the fork.
If there is no replay protection, you won't need this--but you are open to replay attacks. So it would be better to close the channel in case of such a fork (before or after doesn't matter but without making a new LN transaction after the fork).
Closing the channel before a fork is always the safest bet (but maybe not the cheapest).

That's a point with cascading payment channels. To enable cascaded payments without trust it is neccessary to make transactions with time locks. This ensures that everyone gets his/her money back if the payment fails. These time limits only belong to the individual transaction, not to the channel.
Time limits in LN are for:
*) If a channel partner decides to close a channel uncooperative, he has to use a transaction which gives him his money not immediate but after a waiting time. This waiting time is for the other channel partner to check if the channel was closed with the latest correct state. If it wasn't, the channel partner who didn't close the channel can claim all the bitcoins from the channel for himself.
*) In case of cascaded payments you (as middleman) have two channels involved. On one channel you get money and on the other channel you send money. The time limit makes sure, when you don't get your money on the first channel within time, you can claim your money on the other channel back. The time limits must be set appropriate (software should ensure that).
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:20:00
As everywhere, I would try to work with people/companies I have a good opinion of. Of course your channel partner must agree to every transaction you make and if he doesn't I will look for a new partner.
I believe that it's impossible to scale on chain to worldwide adoption with any cryptocurrency. Especially for microtransactions. So, for me that's not a question of small blocks or high on chain fees.
I see the first step in adoption in implementing such solutions in a way they work and the second step in making them as userfriendly and foolproof as possible. And one day many people will use this technology without knowing about it. I see use cases in LN for which no other solutions exists yet and those will push cryptocurrencies forward as soon as they are implemented.

I've read the whitepaper of Lightning Network. It describes very easily to understand the fundamentals of this network and the transaction types it uses.
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:34:46
This closing time is always there in that case. It usually starts, when you close the channel without cooperation. The time is set within the closing transaction. The closing transaction is a bitcoin transaction with a time-lock contract. How it is measured exactly depends on the details of this time-lock transaction (there is more than one possibility to create a bitcoin transaction which contains a time-lock). See:  - LN will use CheckSequenceVerify as time-lock contract.
When you don't use the closing transaction, the channel stays open indefinite (or until the other party closes the channel).
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:42:06
Each LN transaction reflects the whole history of the payment channel. So if you close the channel with payment B, the final coin distribution will include payment A.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:27:32
Payment channels have no predefined closing time. They can stay open forever. Only individual payments through multiple nodes have a time limit.
Yes, every channel locks the funds in it as long as it stays open. Regular users will have only one or a few channels open.
A good routing protocol should find the cheapest route for every payment. Having few nodes on this route will usually lower the overall fee. Routing nodes can lower fees for transactions that help keeping their channels balanced. Of course, fees have to be competitive to make LN a success.
A single "meganode" would lead to the shortest routes but have a lot of other disadvantages. I expect something more decentralized with several big nodes connected to each other and user nodes connected to one or two of this big nodes. A typical transaction would involve 4 to 5 nodes (including user endpoints).
I think, users transacting with each other on a direct channel will be a rare use case.
Big routing nodes shouldn't get to much power because they can be set up quite easily. If one node does something bad, another one will come to replace it. Market forces should lead to a health network structure. Not all nodes will be in countries with strong governments and technically, nodes only have to know about their direct channel partners. Even with government control LN would have it's use cases.
I think too that real scaling has to happen off chain. And I think LN can become a good fundament for it as soon as the potential it delivers is getting to be used.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:28:22
I think every exchange could do something similar today more easily. Funds in channels are locked and can't be used for something else at that time. If you store your additional bitcoins there, it's the same as if you do this on an exchange.
LN transactions are real bitcoin transactions, they could be written to the blockchain. If you use a private ledger instead, it won't be the original idea of LN anymore because writing them to the blockchain won't be possible.
The idea is that those companies can work with you together with your funds but they cannot confiscate or control them because you can withdraw them at any time. This removes the neccessity of trust in the system and that is the big difference to the classic banking system.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:43:46

A bit dramatic
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:04:17
It's up to the two channel partners.
One possibility is to split the channel into two independent channels. Both partners have to support both chains.
If one of the partners won't support one of the split coin, the channel should get closed on that chain after the fork.
In case of missing replay protection I would not transact anymore and close that channel before the fork or after the fork on both chains.
We will see which solutions get implemented by LN software.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:54:32
Yes. Cooperation is only needed to close a channel without waiting time. You can close a channel anytime without cooperation but you will have to wait some time until you get your coins back.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:52:28
This. A channel has no fixed closing time, it can be open endless. Only if one of the two parties decides to close the channel *without consent*, he/she has to wait a defined period, in which the other party gets the chance to prove a wrong closing transaction and claim all the coins. The closing transaction defines the wait time. It can't be changed after it is in the blockchain. The duration of the wait time was agreed upon by both parties beforehand.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:23:20
They are easier to replace than facebook because every sender/receiver only knows about his/her channel partner. You wouldn't even know if nodes on the way to a receiver are replaced and they won't know anything about the users who are not directly connected to them.
Fees will be defined by the market. If someone requests more than reasonable, there will relatively fast develop another cheaper node and replace it.

You are correct. A sheet of paper in a safe is a very good backup for the seed. A wallet is in fact a bunch of addresses and you can see the addresses on the blockchain as soon as they get funds. After emptying those addresses, the information stays on the blockchain, but that doesn't matter, the addresses won't be used ever again. But it's also good practice to keep the old seed, just to be sure to be able to access also the old addresses.
You could lose coins if you generate a new seed on a device which was already be used to store your coins and do not transfer them out before generating a new seed. If you use a new Ledger, you are save.
How to initialize a Ledger hardware wallet depends on the model. For the Ledger Nano S (with display): You only need to power it via USB, no PC necessary but can also be used (doesn't reduce security). Then the Ledger will give you a randomly generated seed on the display which you only need to write down. You never have to enter the seed somewhere else than on the sheet of paper. After that you connect the Ledger with your wallet software (which must be able to support Ledger hardware wallets). The wallet software will get the addresses from the hardware wallet and the hardware wallet will sign transactions for sending bitcoins. This way only the hardware wallet knows the private keys for the addresses and is able to sign transactions. The display on the hardware wallet is for verifying what you want to sign. This way you could use your wallet even on a computer with malware on it without risk of losing your coins.
The addresses are public information, the private key belonging to each address has to be kept secret. In combination with a hardware wallet, private keys will never leave this hardware (also the wallet software won't know them). But they can be reconstructed using the seed.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:53:50
You have to pair your Ledger Nano S with the wallet, not to enter the seed. This way you lose the security of the hardware wallet - you wouldn't need it anymore as the wallet knows the private keys derived from the seed.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:58:35
It's in general a bad idea to store the seed on a computer or harddisk. Hacker could steal it and your bitcoin are gone. Cloud storage would be even worse. I recommend to not use any digital medium for seed backup. Use a simple sheet of paper and write the seed down. You can write it also to a second and third sheet. Than store them in save places where no one has access to but only you.
As your actual seed has already been stored on a computer, it would be safest to generate a new one. I would consider a seed as unsafe as soon as it has been on a computer even if is gets deleted from it. But be careful with generating a new seed to not lose access to your coins on the old one.

It's not necessary to by more hardware wallets only for backup reasons. If a hardware wallet fails, you can restore the bitcoins anytime later on a new device or in a software wallet by using the same seed phrase you used to initialize your original hardware wallet. More hardware wallets make only sense if you want to maintain different wallets with different bitcoins on them or if it takes too long to replace a broken one with a new one otherwise.

I can't answer this question for ETH/ETC. It depends on the type of hardfork. As long as a transaction is valid on both chains, it can get confirmed on both chains after being published (even if it was intended to be confirmed on only one chain). A hard fork, that only increases block size will not make transactions invalid. To do this, the hard fork also has to change the rules for transactions, so that a transaction is only valid on one chain.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:17:51

I've read about probabilistic payments to archieve this but that doesn't sound as a good solution to me. If I want to pay 0.1 satoshi, I don't want to make a payment of 1 satoshi with a chance of 10% to happen.
When sub-satoshi payments become a relevant topic, I would prefer a hard fork which increases the number of decimal places in transaction values.
Maybe offline solutions in LN software would also be ok, with rounding to full satoshi on channel closing.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:25:41
I will hold all my pre-fork coins on both chains. I will buy new coins for transacting on the chain of my choice after the fork. This is the best and safest way for me to hold and use bitcoin at the same time.
