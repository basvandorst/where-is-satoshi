Because they are paired with it for no reason, I hope for proper coin pairing finally.

I would like to see what would happen even though I'm sitting in Vechain or maybe because of that because I can't imagine genuine projects just get trashed because of Bitcoin.

They confiscated Bitcoins also from Silkroad owner, closed BTC-E but it's like Bitcoin services are law abiding figures, many people in crypto world are shady guys that only wait to cash out and run to China like Cryptsy owner.

Let's say their service will be terminated, will I lose an option to change my adress on a site if they'll require a confirmation on old adress?

I heard Reptilians are in this too. We gotta build bunkers and hide before it's too late and THEY GONNA KILL US ALL!

I know about Bitcoin since 2011, I misunderstood Segwit with forking that would destroy his wealth. I don't sit anymore on Bitcoin forums because Bitcoin community became cancerous. I just invested in coins back then and now I read news from time to time and I want to know only the crucial changes and wait until I will be able to pay in every shop with bitcoin via debit card, I don't need all the toxicity every day in my life.

It for was for one buck in January despite I remember it being for 50$ at top few years ago, I'm skeptical if it comes to high price of altcoins in the long run.

Bitcoin community became cancerous like fuck, many nutjobs with tinfoil hats got interested in Bitcoin that say government is planning attacks on crypto lmao.

I invested in multiple shitcoins and guy from Cryptsy stole it all, it would be a nightmare to install 10+ crypto clients to keep them all, at least few months ago there wasn't any client that would allow to store all kind of coins, dunno how it is now. The Bitcoin client is pretty terrible, crypto aren't that convenient as some people say.

It's something related to soft forking.

I would leave it in hope that some people will send some pity tips to compensate my "loss" :D

Miners don't give a single fuck about security, all they want in the end is a fat bank account not fat Bitcoin wallet, they wouldn't give 2 shits if Bitcoin died tommorow as long as they got their share.

I can imagine a loooot of stuff wouldn't exist if not for gaming, just like with porn industry that also pushed technology. So far crypto only proven to take and give nothing back except for niche Paypal alternative.

Gaming let's you have what he have now, probably even Bitcoin became a thing because it pushed the technology we have now.

It's because of Bitcoin, alts are part of Bitcoin whenever one side or other like it or not, they bull run together and they drown together, it's a connected body.
