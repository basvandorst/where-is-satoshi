It is not an attack, it is a service to enable regulatory compliance.  We love our coins just as much as you!

We have a few ideas of how to generate income but nothing is cemented yet.  You are right about the badges though.  You can see a sample badge we have been working with on the bottom right corner of our [website](

* It serves businesses.  They are less likely to enter situations with customers who are committing fraud and less likely to encounter "lost" goods.
* It serves the people.  They will see more businesses that are comfortable opening their doors to bitcoin, and provides a framework for government acceptance rather than whatever plan they come up with on their own.
* It serves the government and people by helping enforcement have a better view of bitcoin related crime.

Let's clear something up.  This is less about coin tainting and more about address verification.  We collect data regarding identity and usage patterns of coins and use this data to make legal compliance easy for businesses and easier for government agencies.
If another company is discerning who they accept based based on what we report it is not our concern.

We agree, this will help the bitcoin community greatly.  We have also been reading users feedback and will address the community in a few days.

No, this is not a real announcement from CoinValidation.
As pointed out in a previous thread, they do not control this account nor do they control their subreddit.
It is real, though, that their plan is ill-concieved and potentially threatens bitcoin. And it is the case that they have not been willing to discuss the technicalities with the community at length or in any detail, so far.
