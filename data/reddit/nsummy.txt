Buying bitcoin isn't the problem. You could buy a million dollars worth of bitcoin and the irs won't care. The problem is when you sell the bitcoin for Fiat.   You aren't going to be able to exchange bitcoin for dollars without irs reporting.

That would cause issues, especially if it's a large amount. You can't just buy and sell assets in your name and have someone else claim it on their taxes.  If you are talking about a few hundred bucks im sure it flies under the radar. But if this was such a large transaction that they claimed it on their taxes, you will have issues.   If by chance you do get audited I would just claim you forgot to report it. If you tell them you did it for someone else they might look into money laundering

Usually yes.  I'm not sure of the official definition of a shell company but generally the phrase is used to describe a company that might be legally registered and has an address, but serves no purpose other than to own other companies. You even see this happen in the US, as certain states have very lax laws regarding incorporating anonymously. Nevada and Delaware come to mind.   On the other hand many companies have overseas offices that they actually employee people but also use as a place to funnel profits. I think Google does this with Ireland. And Walgreens was going to buy a foreign company to do this until there was a giant pushback when it became public.

Get the laws changed to what exactly?  This requirement is no different than stock trading.

What you said makes zero sense....

Talking to your accountant is the best bet.  A similar analogy would be like buying a handgun for a family member, going through the background check, then giving it to said family member.  It completely bypasses the checks and balances.  Or to put it another way, lets say you bought a stock years ago (for a family member),  then sold the stock which resulted in capital gains.  You can't just ignore it on your tax return and let a family member claim it.

He never said it would be all in one year....   Also, if you structure it as a business you can claim a net operating loss for up to 20 years.  That's how Donald trump allegedly dodged hundreds of millions in taxes
