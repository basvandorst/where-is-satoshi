isn't a lack of regulation the whole point? criminals won't be interested if it's regulated and then you'll lose the best use of the currency...
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:40:39
bad news is important too... it's often true
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:24:15
but your buying power would be 10x less? isn't that the point of currency and gains, so you can buy more cool stuff in your lifetime at the best value???

tether isn't a gigantic country. w/ a government, people, regulations to secure it.... and massive economy. you can't go and move to tether one day with your tether house and your tether neighbors

inflation is how life works bud. i'm sure your great grandpa would think its nuts how much a loaf of bread costs. the value of a countries currency lies in the economy &amp; the people. debt / inflation is all just a bunch of numbers

Bill Gates didn't want the internet to exist outside of the Windows ecosystem. He tried to monopolize the internet but failed and the Supreme Court ruled against him. Bill is alright though. It was funny when he got pied by a protester.
There's more to it though, he saw a future where the internet was just a feature of Windows. I have to admit if he pulled it off it would have bolstered Microsoft very very nicely.

since bitcoin trading volume is at it's lowest in a very long time, they are all probably desperate for a jump in trading activity.

Yeah it's just a coincidence. I wonder what happens to exchange revenue when volume tanks
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:38:00
not really. it's simply because most western products are made in china and considering the cheaper labour, the opportunity to copy-cat products cheap flourished. don't spread retarded misinformation
