Oh, sweet quarrels between BTC lovers and alt lovers. How can’t you understand that the crypto market is too young to be sure about anything? Each coin can bring great profit and at the same time, it might disappear. Coins are different and so their purposes and strong sides are. How can we compare them? Personally I think that the crypto world is wonderful not despite, but because of its diversity. For example, I don’t want to put everything on BTC. But I also don’t want to invest in alts only. Isn’t it logical?

 Well, here are some good articles which might give you an answer: from [Hackernoon]( and [CryptoClarified](

 You know, as the history tells there is no good or bad time for doing something. So, if you're looking for a place for buying BTC, try CEX (r/ There you can easily purchase coins by using dc/cc or even bia a bank transfer. Also, you can keep your funds in their cold storage. But better store there only a few and transfer the rest to a hardware wallet.

 Not sure if it's ok to put a credit card. IMO, that's quite strange. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:49:37
 Agree with BTCkoning. Better try exchanges that allow using cc/dc. In addition to the mentioned exchanges, I'd like to recommend CEX. They provide useful tools like Bitcoin Calculator (r/ where you can easily convert btc to usd. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:34:26
 Honestly, I wouldn't do that. Now, when the price of bitcoin started to rise, it might be better to hold for some time. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:30:26
 Try to buy it using your credit card on cex (r/ Keep in mind that verification is required. There shouldn't be any hassle. Also, there always p2p platforms. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:38:27
Well, I think that you won't face any problems. As for commission, I guess that it will depend on chosen exchange and payment method. BTW, as an option, you could try working on cex, as they charge comparably low fees. As for payment methods, you can check their updated condition of wires - r/ Actually, it's better to research conditions of each payment method on each resource, coz it will help you to avoid unnecessary spending’s.   
@_date: 2018-09-20 12:18:19
 I can imagine how exciting it was to monitor the market all this time. I wonder how you did not buy into special offers like "borrow money for crypto"? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:43:03
 Maybe somebody can help me with some advice where to buy crypto? 'Cause I don't trust this guy ��. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:44:05
I agree with Stofilen's words. Judging from the description you provided, that really looks like scam. We know that earning money (no matter if it's fiat or crypto) never was a simple thing. Better ignore such ads and give preference to tried and tested crypto websites. Like CEX ( r/ ). 
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:44:33
 Didn't get it at first, but then it hit me. Are you going to print all history of this thread?��  
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:59:30
 It works this way only in order to get Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself does offer a system that is faster and more convenient. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:00:39
 Honestly, I have no idea if btc can replace common money. For now I can say that this coin has numerous bright sides and therefore it’s quite promising. Besides, I guess that btc has potential to become international currency, which will be accepted everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:53:43
 Really? What to use instead? Maybe you have some ideas concerning that. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:02:31
 Or more or less stable so that the governments could see its potential. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:41:15
 Maybe you should try trade with - r/ . Their transaction fees are based on trade volume and could vary from 0,25% to 0%. But you’ll need to check if this site working in your location, as this exchange doesn’t serve several states.  
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:18:55
 Because with cryptocurrency you have to be attentive and double-check everything. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:24:32
 Try cex - r/ then - they should work fast with crypto-crypto transfers, and they are really easy to use. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:43:36
Well, this meme could be even funnier. Btw, my GF actually asked me where all the money went and I literally had this face :D Speaking seriously, last price changes are more optimistic, maybe we'll see the price of $10K ‘till the end of this year. I’m planning to cash out about 1/3 of crypto portfolio to diversify risks. It’s always easier to convince wife/girlfriend that everything is OK by explaining her how crypto works and showing actual profits. And it’s never a problem for geek girls who are traders/investors, by my gf isn’t one of them.

I really love infographics, so thanks for this post. However, in my opinion it’s a little bit undetailed. Only basic things without exact definitions or specific features, even without comparison of pros and cons. Anyway, the image is wonderful for beginners, who want to dive in the crypto world in the first time. Those, who want to learn more, can easily search for full articles and pictures.

 I think that it’s not about TRADING vs HODLING, it’s about MAKING MONEY vs USING MONEY. It’s interesting that Bitcoin now acts like a new digital gold but Satoshi didn’t want to turn his creation into this. I mean, a lot of people consider BTC as a coin suitable for trading or hodling but not for money transfers. You should remember that Bitcoin was conceived as a global payment system, not as a trading-only asset. Probably, the currency will go up if more people start using it, paying for goods and services with it, sending it to friends.

 With such a speech, you can even be a lector at the TED. Despite I wouldn’t be that sure about colonies on Mars or other almost fantastic things, I’m almost certain that Bitcoin is a valuable part of our financial future. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:47:13
Oh, it seems like I’ve missed something, haven’t I? Were there another interesting link or another scam/panic site? Anyway, according to the topic’s title, I can say that each hodler should learn how to keep calm. It’s crucial for people who have chosen long term trading and want to make money from large moves. Small growths or falls are shouldn’t be significant for them. I know myself how difficult it is to calmly keep crypto when the market turns in red but it’s possible. Patience is a key of hodlers’ success.

Honestly, I think that banks that returning to a gold standard is not the only thing that stops btc from being worldwide adopted. There are other problems too. For example, some people still think that cryptocurrency is some kind of scam. The others are not sure how to use it and don’t want to learn. There are governments where it is forbidden to user crypto and do on. However, I believe that sooner on later bitcoin will become worldwide adopted.

 As far as I know, on January 3, 2009, the first block was generated. October 2008 is known for the whitepaper publication. So, there are two options of Bitcoin's anniversary. Anyway, we can be proud of its achievements and growth. Who could even imagine back then how far it would expand during these years!

 Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has invented blockchain using some principles from inventions that have already existed. These were the inventions like independent encrypted currencies, the technology of hash blocks linking in one chain, proof-of-work mechanisms. So, Bitcoin was the first use of blockchain that we know, but the background was set 10-15 years before it.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:50:12
Long live to the King Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:34:57
Great idea, it could work pretty well to promote Bitcoin and bring even 
more hype to it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:38:00
It's all because coinbase is number-one destination for crypto
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:32:06
 Calm down, guys :) Honestly, I can't see any sense in arguing 'cause I doubt that we can be 100% confident that this info is truth. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:20:38
Well, you can try using [cex]( . It may serve like a good alternative to Coinbase. But it's important to mind your location, as they operate in the USA, but not in all states. 
As for KYC, I will agree with GolferRama, all exchanges require that. Probably, you should decide for yourself what you're looking — some change to Coinbase (which means centralized exchange), or decentralized one 
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:09:05
 Bitcoin definitely is a good thing, but to my mind you shouldn’t push it too much. For instance lets discuss mining. I mean that fact that this activity requires the best and high-power equipment, not just ordinal PC. And some poor people can’t afford it.

 There are always some risks involved. And always will be. We cannot be immune from everything. There are always some risks involved. And always will be. We cannot be protected from everything, but it doesn’t mean that risk don’t worth it. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:35:40
 Agree. Such question is too debatable, and I'm afraid we may never reach common conclusion. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:35:49
 I've just began learning about crypto market, so correct me, please, if I'm mistaken ... As far as I know, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are completely different. BCH was created to retrieve some BTC issues. It may have lower fees for making transactions, but due to Bitcoin's widespread acceptance, Bitcoin Cash still needs some time to find its audience. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:28:42
 I think it may be useful for you to check this source as well -  It’s pretty good imo. 
I mean, I'm not an expert, but if I needed something to start with, I’d pay attention on that resource. And also these articles -    
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:45:18
I will print it and stick it to the wall, like a poster. That is really great. A masterpiece I should say.
@_date: 2018-07-13 14:05:19
 Just stop panicking, please. Such things are natural, especially with Bitcoin. Its price is going deep not for the first time. I even hope that someday it'll go to the moon. So, all we need is to keep calm and monitor the market.

 Bitcoin is a multifunctional cryptocurrency which can be used as a currency and as an asset. Bitcoin took the best features from both gold and fiat. Due to the deficiency bitcoin won’t meet inflation and on contrary will grow in price. At the current stage of development, bitcoin is a great alternative to gold and traditional currencies if we don’t take into account the volatility. So in the future cryptocurrency has a big potential to be adopted worldwide. Bitcoin is a new kind of digital money, and we can’t label it with current concepts and apply current approaches. Its valuableness lies in its functions that bitcoin successfully performs. People need it because despite its volatility bitcoin is a better store of value than the national currencies of many countries. Every time I have extra money, I buy some bitcoin on cex because it’s one of the few trustworthy platforms available in my country. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:28:40
 To invest money because some rapper said the coin would rise? It’s ridiculous. With all the opportunities, the crypto world is filled with scams and frauds. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:21:24
 First educate yourself more about bitcoin and decide upon why you need it. The choice of the best exchange can be tiresome as there are a lot of them. I consider CEX the best option to purchase bitcoin to purchase bitcoin for a newbie. Any reputable and safe exchange requires registration and verifying of your ID. If you don’t want to give your personal information, you can try peer-to-peer platform like localbitcoins. However, it’s riskier as there is no guarantee plus the prices are often higher.

I am for Jan 03 as a birthday of bitcoin. However, Oct 31 is a key date to remember as well – it was the time the idea of bitcoin was put together.

 It sounds like a paradox to censor the decentralized platform. I think while we reach that level of decentralization on the Internet, it will have its own ecosystem with several layers, operating across a huge amount of blockchain protocols. I think that people who will develop the concept of the decentralized Internet, will certainly take into account security for thread. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:51:25
For your information, sometimes not all countries are served for withdrawals. So you’d better not accuse any exchange of scam activity once you didn’t care enough to read the terms and conditions of using the service.
