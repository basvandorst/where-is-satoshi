This is a viable attack. However it's much harder when HTTPS is used.
Why not use protection if you can?
@_date: 2014-11-21 12:26:15


Absolutely correct.
If Commerzbank was increasing their reserves, then I wouldn't moan about fees.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:13:42
Yeah, tipping for good content is nice. I just don't like that people feel like they *have* to tip everyone because it's the norm.
For example: In above comment I honestly didn't ask for tips. And I didn't want you to feel like being asked for it, either.
That's why reducing (not abandoning!) the tipping thing might be good.

Yeah, but the right solution would be to stop that insane tipping mania, rather than suspecting every newcomer. :-(

With Commerzbank, you rely on fractional reserve AND have to pay for it.
And BTW, they don't "store" your money: They hand it out rather freely.

This is a bad advice. VPN doesn't do anything to solve that issue. It just moves the problem from one central point of failure (your ISP) to another central point of failure (your VPN).
HTTPS is far from secure, but it's still *much* better than plain HTTP.


Wrong! It's very easy (and profitable) to automatically detect and replace all Bitcoin addresses if you're running a MITM attack. So they are definitely at risk.

Thanks a lot, I still have to figure it out though.
(I'm just getting a blank site when I follow that link. :-/ Do they have some kind of help chat somewhere?)

Nope. The reserve requirements in Europe were not increased.
Instead, the ECB charges negative interest rates on deposits held in central bank accounts, which is why ordinary banks (like Commerzbank) pass that on to their customers.
This doesn't make their offer any better. It's still the same fractional reserve system with the same fraction. Just more expensive.


Sounds like "the price is high, so the product must be good" to me.

Right. In fact, depositing fiat money in a central bank account is the safest way to store fiat money that ever can be.
The central bank can *by definition* not go bankrupt (in their own currency).
The problem is that banks are encouraged not to do it.

Everything in your post is accurate, except the beginning.

I normally connect with tor.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:43:27
Your bitcoin miner *is* a heater. ;-)
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:24:26


TL;DR: Yes.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:05:55
Thanks! :-)
But how does that work? What am I supposed to do now?
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:45:21


Wrong. From the linked article:


Emphasis mine.

This pic made my day.
It's actually the reason why I signed up. Hi there, !
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:41:16
Good point!
But it reminds me of some other expression I heard, also of the type "warm + [monetary unit]". If I could just remember what it was :-/
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:11:19
I think I remember now it was "warm numbers", with respect to currency.
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:39:57
Me too. It's great!
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:14:04


I doubt that. The ad contains enough hints to get the missing info from context.
People usually learn new things by seeing them in a context they already are familiar with.


This ad contributes to solving that issue.

It's the unit of bitcoin currency: 100 000 000 satoshis are 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:16:43
What's wrong with Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:21:21
I didn't know about reddit before Bitcoin.
Why are you so negative?
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:30:05
Yes, it's possible to MITM HTTPS, but that is *much* more difficult than HTTP.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:48:44
OP isn't negative about donations.
It's about poor security practices.
