both things can coexist. i think we can't be dogmatic, and shall imply free thinking, towards looking at the demands of future, and realize that we must find alternatives for certain kinds of problems, that will affect us all sooner or later

in fact i think it has existed for longer. because industrialization didn't necessarely start with neither the 1st 2nd or 3rd industrial revolution. in fact, when the was wheel or the fire were invented (or at least discovered), we were already talking about industrialization. so it comes almost of the most primitive and seminal forms of human knowledge, and mankind. it's always been there. and in fact it's something pretty great when properly channelled, being progress of people's life quality an example of a proper usage of industrialization, and war a bad example (but even in war, sometimes, good things happened in terms of evolutionary processes, in terms of scientific research, etc. - anyway i am not defending warfare, not at all - in fact, i am the first to criticize it). minimum wage, occupational lienses is a thing to fight against, but i am afraid universal basic income well end up playing an important role in that overall process

in fact some countries already have invested funds in bitcoin stocks, as well as mining (finland, us, sweden, norway, netherlands, perharps germany, etc.). as well as corporations (which is not necessarely a bad thing, under an anarcho-capitalist analysis). that's part of the reason why bitcoin value has gone high so quickly. and we talking about corporations and anarcho-capitalism, i think that corporations may have an important role in putting pressure under more governments to avoid more conflicts. we already saw that when amazon bought part the actions of an important newspaper in us, that has contributed to criticizing trump politics. and i am more and more convinced, that it may be something important
