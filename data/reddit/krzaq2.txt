This is actually good news. Before you downvote, hear me out: my confidence in getting my coins back was so low that I take this as a proof that they're at least working on a solution. So instead of never I can now hope for "few months".
tl;dr: this is good because we ran out of the bad news in the case of mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:45:00
Yes, of course. That's why receiving information from an alternative source makes it better. Look at it like this: the situation is terrible - because they suck at communication and at being an exchange. After reading this post, I at least know they're **trying** - which is more than I expected (and hoped for) yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:23:10


None of which are required to load and display text, they just make it prettier.


Then it is a shitty framework. Honestly, unless you're doing a web app (as opposed to a web page), requiring js is a dick move. Security and privacy aside, there's also making thousands of clients do what could be done once by the server. Talk about being green.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:10:21
We didn't. The whole point of this tweet was showing the difference recognizable/non-recognizable currency code would have on popularity of bitcoin. Names are important. XBT, as proper as it is, doesn't mean a thing to almost anyone. BTC is far more recognizable (and easier to connect with bitcoin for normal people)

My first thought was "if they don't want tipping, you shouldn't break their rules". Then I went to read the rules, and the only thing that remotely applies is 


Expecting one to follow unwritten rules is sick indeed.
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:49:16
According to [wikipedia](


XBC would be the best, but it's already [claimed]( and that's why XBT was [chosen instead](
BT stands for Bhutan, so even though BTC currency code is not currently in official use, it isn't correct either.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:25:00
You're both right and wrong. You mention problems that exist *today* - and you're right here. Then you're making sweeping statements based on the assumption that those problems can't be overcame. A few years ago, you'd probably say that you wanted to pay your, say, graphics designer with bitcoins, but converting them to fiat was too much of a hurdle for her. Now? It's trivial.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:06:43
Why are they calling them bits instead of credits?
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:00:11
Bits are too confusing, especially since you can further split them. 
I'd much rather use the already advertised and well known term: credits.

Would you mind providing context of the joke?

Actually, that is believable if they refilled the hot wallet with funds from the cold one as soon as it was emptied - without checking if numbers matched. And that is a level of incompetency I came to expect from them.

It seems I need to bring the heavy guns.
to decrease - [definition](


Even if one person drops bitcoin/drugs/torrents/whatever the number of people using it *decreases*. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:17:10
You can't. You can, at best, buy "btc vouchers", but they can't be redeemed and it's not sure it they ever will be redeemable again.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:43:33
Theoretically, yes, it is possible. The code would have to be damaged/partially covered in the Just Right Way™. The difficulty of doing that is inverse to the error correction level used in the code and I won't drop any numbers, but let me say it's not very probable; the probability is very, very small. But that's not all, you can't just put any other address there, it has to have the same length and has to pass the sanity check for a bitcoin address - and you have 1:2^-32 chance of doing that randomly. It's like winning a lottery twice in two tries.
tl;dr: no more than someone guessing your private key.
QR codes with different levels of error correction will contain the same data but look differently.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:44:54
Well, all I need to disprove your theory is to find one person who doesn't torrent now, but would if it was safe and didn't carry a social stigma. I already know several such people so... yeah.
It's the same for drugs, there are people who would at least try some, but don't want the hassle of doing something illegal and the possibility of getting subpar product. If I could go to a grocery store (or even an apotheracy) and legally buy marijuana, I would.

@_date: 2014-10-29 15:16:08
Decreases doesn't mean "vanishes". Do you honestly think that if torrenting was legal, it would be exactly as popular as it is now, when it cannot be advertised, when torrent sites are penalized in google and people are telling you that you wouldn't download a car? Please.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:10:53
I assume that this is a a textual article, which makes me wonder why the site requires javascript to display it...
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:50:29
They don't. The user does, and the meaning of the comment changes because of that - either it's $2 key (crappy) or 4096-bit key - pretty damn good.
@_date: 2014-03-26 10:35:26
I'd prefere an easter present, tbh.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:27:17
Sure, but I will oppose pointless requirements as long as I can (in fact, I thought if anyone understood that, it'd be people on this subreddit). Allowing javascript (or anything else, for that matter) run on your computer is [a risk]( I will not take unless there's a reason. Requiring javascript to display text is either retarded or evil - kinda like requiring you to pay with a credit card in a grocery store (it's 2014, dude, everything requires cc).

I don't expect any sympathy, I included that information because I didn't want the OP to use the "you haven't lost anything, so it's easy for you to say" argument. 
I risked, I lost - or as good as - and I feel stupid now. That's all there is to it.

Right, but I think it would be enough to write 20MB every ten minutes though.
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:08:51


Let me try to put it in simpler terms, then.










100 people like A
10 people like B
A is made illegal. 5% drop A.
95 people like A
10 people like B
A's popularity decreased, but it doesn't mean that the legal B is suddenly more popular.


The way I see it, they became popular because the torrent protocol is perfect for large-scale distribution of files. That's why Blizzard used it in its downloader, for example.
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:49:31
Is it actually proven to be impossible to create such a vanity address, or is it simply "unlikely"?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:54
I have coins (small amount, fortunately) on Mt. Gox and I do want my money back, but that's a separate matter from stopping considering Mt. Gox an exchange. It is no longer an exchange, because, guess what, you can't exchange your fiat money to bitcoins. So yeah, let's remove it from charts, not as a payback, but because it simply doesn't belong there.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:37:43
It stops some. How many? I wouldn't know. Again, "more difficult" doesn't automatically mean "impossible".

Well, you didn't list any, and it only adds to the confusion, even for normal users and there are better and more unique words.
Let's consider a situation where one bitcoin is worth ~$200k, making 1µ฿ ~ $0.2:




or even now:




@_date: 2014-04-20 01:55:10
But 1µ฿ is a `credit` already...

It's not a problem with RAID 5 or 6. If you want to be extra sure you can even double the price and simply use RAID1. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:07:42
Do they blame this on the bank? Because, to me, it looks like they promise "You'll have your money in up to 5 business days via a SEPA transfer", not claim that it takes as much to execute one. They may very well keep the majority of their funds in time deposits or have some internal procedure involving a delay.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:26:58


They - well - we would love to do that. But Mt. Gox stopped all withdrawals in a very shady manner. That's why people are losing faith in it.

I'd love to be able to pay amazon for the upcoming Cold Days book with my coins. Besides that, it'd just be utility bills.

I'm pretty sure we can consider some coins lost, if their private keys are lost. If they aren't out of circulation forever, it would mean that the whole currency is worthless.

Thanks, but I've already googled that - but that's my point. I didn't need to google what wordpress was, it was something that I'd already known accepting bitcoins. Finally :) Now I have to wait for something that I actually use and would pay for.

You're better off mining with your cpu, imo.
@_date: 2012-09-19 05:59:34
For me, the cap was never the cpu/ram load, but the number of proxies and sockets I could keep open (although I blame my router &amp; isp for the last one). If it's not a problem for you (and I remember that you once said that you were able to have dozen bots connect from one IP) , then yeah, it's probably better than cpu mining, but I still doubt it's worth the effort. I mean, you probably are out of accounts that can be used to bot anyway.

100% would be fine for small amounts, but, unless you're a medium+ corporation, $700 isn't a small amount for you. I'd go with the customary 10%, to be honest.

They don't care, it's an excuse. Occupy Wall Street? A few protesters on a street won't change a thing. BitCoin, on the other hand, just might. And they can't control it.

From my point of view microtransactions have never been possible, as long as I remember (which is since mid-2011). 
The most popular full blockchain clients enforced 50 000 credits fee, which made such small transfers ineconomical; now the minimal transaction is going to be 5430 credits, and don't tell me about "democracy", we all know that most people mindlessly use the default configuration.
For all intents and purposes one BitCoin is no longer divisible into 10^8 satoshis, but into 18416.2 new_satoshis.

I don't quite understand. We can't stop them, should they choose to add Bitcoin as currency. And I don't think it would be bad for Bitcoin either: while it grows fast, it's far from ubiquity. PayPal accepting it, exposing its users to Bitcoin and providing easy means of distribution would be a great help in that regard.
I tried getting people pay me for freelance work with bitcoin: I only succeeded once and I had to wait for over a week for Coinbase to process my customer's order, way past the job deadline; the job itself took me about 4 hours. With PayPal I'd be paid in 5 minutes, and the risk of scam would be the same.

Is there any hidden cost? Besides the coins, of course. I hoped to include a 25000µ฿ wallet in the gift I'm going to give my about-to-be godson.

I know one thing for sure, you can't try to draw it on a postcard if you have no artistic skill.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:02:43
25000µ฿ equals 0.025฿ or 25 m฿ (± $18), but I'd rather get 25000 of something small than 0.025 something million times bigger ;) Especially if I didn't know what I'm getting.

Anyhow, there was a confirmed double-spend. How can you say that no one lost money directly?
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:32:46
My point exactly. Free market is the miners. If its profitable enough (or they're feeling charitable, or whatever), they can include zero-fee transactions. In fact, that's exactly what happens.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:37:46
I dunno, I heard you could once purchase 10000 BTC for a pizza.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:48:41
Armory also forces a fee for certain transactions. Its ridiculous that people claim that bitcoin can be divided into units of size of 0.01µBTC, but the smallest fee allowed by the most popular clients is 50 000 times higher than that.
@_date: 2013-06-16 21:04:54
It's not like it's the only free host out there, is it?

Divisible to 4 decimal places is closer to the truth - after all after an update about half a year ago the network no longer processes transactions smaller than 5300 satoshis.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:25:13
And then we can call them credits, like they do in all the sf! 1µ฿ = 1 credit.
@_date: 2013-09-07 01:36:16
Non-bitcoin users aren't affected either. They're just shifting tax¹-money from one place to another.
¹ it's not exactly a tax, but it's mandatory and everyone here in Poland knows that once you pay it, you're never going to see it again, so it's not a big loss.
