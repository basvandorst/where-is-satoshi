It is a wallet adress, 12 words.
I tried the Mycelium wallet but the words does not work. Are there different standards of mnemonic in different wallets?

Everything is very confusing.
1. blockchain.info - I check my active public adress from my Electrum wallet where I have a small amount and it says it is empty.
2. Blockchain.info - I check the adress I found in my document and blockchain says it is empty, wich may be true.
3. I have tried a number of wallet apps for android and only breadwallet approved my mnemonic words. However, breadwallet gave me another public adress.
4. I have searched my old Ubuntu computer for any Wallet software and can not find any. I must have created the wallet online.
5. Memory is a bitch! Why can't I remember ever writing this Bitcoin wallet in my document? (yes, I know I was ill...)
If there is any coin of coins in the wallet there is a reward! :-)

Aaaahrgh, no luck. I have tried the mnenomic phrase on Mycelium, breadwallet and Copay. No luck. 
The mnemonic is well written, I don't think I have misspelled anything. 
Anything more I should try or just forget about it?

Thanks! :-)
I don't have severe memory loss. I just can't recall ever creating a wallet wich I aparantly did. IF, and this is a big IF, I actually bought some coins there is a huge value development since 2013 I don't want to miss.

I have passwords in my file. They are 10 and 11 characters long.

The adresses in Electrum based on my mnemonic is not the same as the adress I find from the same mnemonic in the app "Simple Bitcoin wallet".

My mnemonic is 12 words. I heard that Electrum use 13 words. I have now tried Electrum on PC and it created a wallet, however, it is not the same adress that I have written in my file.

Electrum on my computer recognized my mnemonic. It shows no Bitcoin. However, the adresses I can see in Electrum is not the same as in the the file I have saved.
I can not find evidence of any installed wallet on my Ubuntu PC. No browser history of Electrum.
Were there any good online wallets in 2013?

No coins found. I found evidence of a wallet. I am not sure I actually bought anything. I don't remember creating a wallet and don't remeber buying. I have evidence that I created a wallet and researched on how to buy bitcoin in 2013.

I have heard that the mnemonic for Electrum is 13 words long. Correct?
My mnemonic is 12 words.

no hardware wallet unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:16:51
Any wallet app? Or some specific?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:35:25
I know what a hardware wallet is and unfortunately I don't think I bought one. I haven't seen any hardare wallet laying around. Unfortunately!
What do you mean with "cc history"?
