**It's called bitcoin. We spend bits.**
In this context, I will again point out the post of user/bitcoin_bits 10 month ago. I think he describes it very well why "bit" is a good solution. 
I hope all major bitcoin organizations commit themselves formally to this unit soon.

Ok you understand the metric system, fine. 
Let's say bitcoin plays an important role in the future. Than it will come that one writing his prizes in full BTC another site will use mBTC and and yet another is using μBTC (where is this symbol on my keyboard) Probably it would also work but why so complicated? And trust me for many people it is complicated. If I had the choice I would always opt for the foolproof solution. And which is in this case a single “unit” - bits
On the other site people that using mBTC today says often “millibits” instead of “millibitcoins” I say one step further I say people will use “bits” instead of “millibits” just because it is more convenient.
You see there is no way around it ;)

Was there also to read why?
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:58:40
According to my Understanding, SegWit excludes certain data from a transaction, so more transactions can go into a single block, but the Block is still 1 MB. 
BTW: I'am not a SegWit critic.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:12:53
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:23:56
Was there a recently or is there planned a meeting like the Hongkong Meeting?
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:44:35
Perhaps one reason but I personally can not imagine that most of miners think so. Alone for the reason LN will come this way or another, even BU will have to implement it sometime.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:10:40
Correctly it should be said SegWit is a Capacity increase not a Blocksize increace. The Blocksize would still be 1 MB.
But the point is the low adoption of Core's solution. Only a few miners likes it, no matter if the reason is technical or political nature. Obviously Core had a lack of foresight or competence to recognize this problem in time. At the end of the day, the only thing that counts is whether Bitcoin has a good or a bad user experience. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:09:15
From a user's perspective I would summarize it like you.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:13:42
According to your opinion, would it not be the next logical step to enter into a dialogue with them to explain the consequences of stuck transactions or bad user experience. This can not be in their interest and reminds of self-destructive behavior. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:13:48
I mean short-term solution regarding to increase the capacity
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:23:42
Is there a platform where miners are able to organize themselves? For example to bring up concern or generally a channel for communication?
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:53:51
But that's the point, I have not yet read a statement of a miner even less a discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:28:00
One more question: Was there a recently or is there planned a meeting like the Hongkong meeting?
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:16:45


Segwit would properly the best temporary solution but obviously it has little chances of success at the current situation. Therefore the question is justified. 


I think the reason why he asked the question is becauce Bitcoin is in the process to reach his capacity limits.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:51:41
Okay, thank you for your explanation.

@_date: 2016-06-19 12:16:48
Thank you for your response, everything you wrote sounds quite good but I think the average Bitcoin/Dark Market User don’t care about what is maybe possible in future. They care about stuck confirmations and high fees so about the matters that concern them just now. I am worry about because it is a no-brainer to replace bitcoin at Dark Markets.
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:46:56
:) I am just think what would if the FED says the Dollar should distance itself from illegal transactions…  this don't work that way. Without Dark Markets Bitcoin would not be where he is today and I am also think in relation to all Bitcoin transactions the proportion of Dark Market transaction is still the biggest.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:07:48
Thanks, good read. Seems there was a time Antpool was open for discussion. I dont know how much own mining power antpool (bitmain) has, but I think ( correct me if I am wrong ) the majority mining power are individual miners? For me, pool owner have a bit to much power, but actually every miner is free to change the pool.

Sorry I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:42:21
Hm, this has a lot to do with pride and ego. Imagine you preach for years that a hardfork with blocksize increace is bad for bitcoin and dezentralisation and you came up with a seemingly safer solution, Segwit (which I would agree) It musst be a defeat for you to enter into a compromise which includes a hardwork. For one hand becauce all your hard work is seemingly for nothing. And the other reason is you would think you losing your face in front of the community, even if its not so. It wouldt be really unwise to put your peronal preferences over the preferences of the Communitity. Segwit may be the safest way to scale but if there is no realistic possibility to activate Segwit there have to find other solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:58:44
Unfortunately wrong again, thats also not a compromise that is the other extreme. 2MB Hardfork + Segwit is a compromise for example
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:40:12
Yes, I always imagine when all current Bitcoin users want to make a transaction which must be confirmed in a foreseeable time, than this is not possible at the moment becauce the fees would rise exorbitantly and there will be always people they will fall by the wayside.
But what I am really cocerning about is that all user who come in contact with bitcoin the first time will think that bitcoin is expensive and slow. In other words it is a bad user experience compared to altcoins. Altcoins may have the same problems at a certain time but this is no preference to users. I use bitcoin since 2011 and I appreciate it very much as a store of valve but if these run of new users continues and nothing happens, the store of valve is the only usecase for bitcoin for now. Your example with the private island sound really good but no one can predict the future. To do nothing, is nothing else as to speculate on bitcoin's first mover effect. Unfortunately I can not estimate, from my perspective, if UASF is the right way I'd wish there would be a personal meeting between developers and miners to negotiate something to get out of this deadlock.

Usable is a broad term. Sure it is usable but under what conditions.


Agree, but it is also possible that users and companys switches to other blockchains before such technologies are established. It is nothing else than speculate on Bitcoins first mover effect.

@_date: 2017-05-12 12:51:42
You always repeat the same phrase but you don't offer a solution. Do you think Segwit be activated by itself over night. If you could not convince the miner while the last two year how high is the probability that you can convince them in the next two years?
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:20:36
Yeah right, what I mean is a **new** roundtable. Who would have guaranteed the attention at the whole Bitcoin Community and there would be no excuses do not comply this decision. Look recently at Litecoin, all importent members of the Ltc Communtinty came together at a Roundtable Meeting and within 24 hours they come up with a succesful solution for all involved and look at the result Segwit will be activated in a few days. I just do not understand why the Btc Community is not able to do the same or at least try to do it. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:19:40
Ok, no one could see that coming. But now we have to do something and I mean not to push Segwit or push BU but push a compromise.

We make it as I want - compromise?
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:16:32
That Core has influence on community is obviously. You said yourself. This does not require any arguments.  OK in other words you would accept that this war will continue the next years and risk that bitcoin dies slowly than enter into a compromise? Or what is plan B? There is a deadlock and nothing will change if we remain passive. I can not believe that anyone thinks that everything will solved by itself and segwit gets suddenly activated. I can not get it in my head that obviously intelligent people are unable to get at a table and find a solution with whom all can live. With Litecoin it worked well with a roundtable. You and Core have a great reputation in (one half of) the community I think you have the ability to bring the Comunity together.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:33:30
I think when you could start a representative survey, 75% of the entire Bitcoin community would agree with 2MB HF + Segwit. Problem are the harcore BU and CORE Fanboys which are the loudest and distort the picture.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:12:55
You can repeat it ever and ever again but unfortunately it doesen't change the fact the Segwit will never activated by 95% approval rate. Probably not even at 75% in this deadlock we are "at the moment". Or do you think differently? Why not a roundtable to find a solution with all parties can live with. I mean what is the alternative, wait another two years just to notice we still just in the same situation? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:45:31
Granted, that sounds good but sadly it isnt an answear to the current debate. Reality is, Bitcoin has a scaling problem and if this not solved then its not excluded Bitcoin will superseded by another blockchain. Apart from this that "faulty technical decisions" is greatly exaggerated I would rather make a compromise than hazard the presumable consequences of a stagnation. Everything else is ideological nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:27:53
Have you tried the transaction accelerator?
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:32:00
That was only possible because Charlie Lee was not above to actuate all parties to a roundtable and negotiate a compromise with whom all can live. Just sayin.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:37:55
yes, but September next year
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:59:21
in a nutshell:
* r/btc want to scale bitcoin by raising the the 1MB Blocklimit which only works with a hardfork
* r/bitcoin want to scale bitcoin by SegWit which can be done with a softfork
* softfork is more predictable than a hardfork becauce a hardfork has a risk of a chainsplit
fun fact: many r/bitcoin users call for bip148 UserActivatedSoftFork which has also a risk of a chainsplit
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:06:15
but I thought every miner are able to choose the pool of his choise 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:48:16
Honestly I dont know but G.Maxwell is obviously different opinion. I would feel more comfortable when no parties passed over. On the other side it seems its no longer a topic at least as long as the price rises :/
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:43:59
And do you really think that Segwit will activated this year, or what is the quintessence?
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:37:01
Seems I have a different conception about the term compromise. For me its a compromise when both parties agree. Anyway, what do you suggest if segwit never happens and it looks like this. Why do we want to avoid a harfork? -Becauce we have a safer possebility to scale! -Right. But at some point in time the safty of Segwit intersects with the risk of no action. In other words what is the use of segwit when its never activated and user gets more and more frustrated becauce of high fees etc. Ok now you can say Bitcoin is established gold standard and people will always use Bitcoin - I would go with them when Bitcoin had been established for 50 years but it isnt and history has shown many times how fast a technology is replaced by another. I do not say this happens but I say it is a possebility and it is dangerous to say that could never happen. In my view this is a not to be underestimated risk factor which is larger then a compromise or a controlled hardfork.

One more question, is that really possible to limit mining to CPU's and or GPU's ?
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:10:45
I am afraid we are spinning in a circle. I assume with Bitmain you mean all the miners who have the free choise to signal segwit or not. 
Then please tell me what is the alternative if Segwit never gets activated?
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:34:57
Why do you not quote the entire sentence? I wrote 2MB HF + Segwit. Anyway, I am completely different opinion. If there were a guarantee that a 2MB HF would end this endlees scaling debate and activate Segwit more than 75% of the comunity would agree. Imaging Core would support a 2MB HF in one of the next version do you really think the Core nodes will greatly decrease?
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:02:01
I never understood correctly how it could happen that Gavin was suddenly no longer a Core Developer.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:56:15
This is about a compromise between two parties. Compromise - "an agreement or settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions." One side want a HF blocksize increase the other side want Segwit. Quite simply actually.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:14:37
Do you realize that you only repeat your claims without any justifications. In most cases, people want to cover their weak argumentation with these strategy.

@_date: 2017-05-08 14:46:43
Very interesting, I dont looked into this topic yet but back to CPU/GPU mining sounds to me like a huge improvement for bitcoin in terms of mining decentralization and fairness. Just wondering if its also fair for the current miner who has invest a lot of money in their hardware. But since the mining hardware will be obsolete with time in any case maybe this might not be such a big problem if there is a long time period between the change.

@_date: 2017-05-13 15:59:30
The fact that you blame me for spreading FUD because I take a stand for an approach or an agreement between miners and developers shows me that you're either ignorant or have a limited horizon, to to describe it nicely.

@_date: 2017-06-11 18:01:56
First everyone is telling for years that a 2MB hardfork (with which all problems could have already solved) is dangerous and must be prevented at all costs but now UASF is okay, with is much more risky in view of a chain split and now even a POW change? Seems to me that some bitcoin devs slowly realize that bitcoin will hit the wall with their strategy and now stick out with overhasty aktions. Everyone who really thinks that threats can resolve this conflict lacks a healthy outlook and should not speak in name of Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't a playground anymore, many people have really something to lose it.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:29:55
in what way?
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:26:40


In the meantime, with two hostile parties, yes but two years ago a cleanly planned HF would most likely not ended in a chain split.


Do not you see stupidity?
**First, bitcoin devs create SegWit that only activates if 95% of all miners agree even though they know that the majority of the miner want something completely different.**
**Now UASF needs also a certain hashrate to don't throw Bitcoin into chaos but has less miner support then SegWit has.**
