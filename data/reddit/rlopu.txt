yep in the same boat but I think the fact that bitfinex was down during the down break on other exchanges has added to the effect of people trying to sell off on bitfinex

hahahhaha you fuckin gun, I'll be interested in what they all paid..

Panic sellers are going crazy and bitfinex came back online after an hour outage where the price closed at 740usd and when the market opened at 00:15ucd it crashed like 2 minutes later and all sell orders had gone down the 684 so now coinbase and quoine are crashing. It'll to back up but retard panic sellers fuck themselves . You can make money by buying when it gets down to 660 -+ because that'll be the minimum dip but. There's a huge sellout going down on bitfinex but no one can sell, that's why it looks like bitfinex's price is at 684 but it would be a lot lower if they didnt crash again. Maybe the owners want to sell off on other exchanges with a stable decline instead of the plumet of shit that happens on bitfinex

Jesus why'd you leave now it's tanking

I don't think bitfinex will become insolvent but it is causing the market to utterly crash, tbh they might have been orchestrating all of the rallies, it would be incredibly easy with 1000btc at your disposal and an exchange which trades 10x what anyone else does per day
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:14:12
why did bitfinex turn out to be a shitty exchange :(

If you had tens of thousands of dollars on the market why would you sell? Its obviously going to go back upwards of $750 and I doubt you paid any more, unless you mean you've missed out on tens of thousands cause you could have made some $$ off the drop and rise

If you were margin trading it is a lot scarier to hold because of the liquidation point, but if you don't use all your funds, unless you're 100% sure, then you can hodl even with margin trading. Never sell for a loss, man, ever, just got hold on, between the transaction fees and the risk of losing again, just hold, trade when the market really looks like everyone's about to drop everything because it's fairly.. safe to make those guesses. Good luck

cause bitfinex users can't make any sell orders atm so when they can they're gonna absolutely tank the market. maybe, but when the market went from 740 to 715/720 on all other exchanges and bitfinex was in maintenance and had closed 40 minutes prior at 740, so when it opened an hour later the avg btc price was 715 and there was a huge sell off which tanked the price to 685 in 2 minutes and since then it's still down. So when it opens again it's gonna be just as bad. But I think it will still go up after this because people are gonna realise btc is still the best thing and be like shit I can get it at 660 right now and it's definitely gonna be going up to 800, 900, 1000 in the next few weeks

I started trading on bitfinex about a week ago, I'm not a greedy person I just bought my first bitcoin at 580 and when it went to 680 I wanted to try some trading so I signed up to bitfinex and discovered their margin trading thing, Quite annoyed that they're closed again at $712 close but price is now $657, getting close to my liquidation price so I'm in for a loss.....
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:52:40
It's not illegal and if I had the bitcoins and an afternoon free I could write a bot for it, I just can't imagine there aren't other bigger players out there doing it. Sure the owners of bitfinex wouldn't be using bitfinex coins but they'd have a lot, of friends

I know the risk but I've been investing only 800usd to be able to play with $2700 worth and because I'm usually good at jumping on declines and rallies I thought it was alright but I couldn't get out during the fall, I hope my order doesn't liquidate because I will just be holding on at a .05% daily interest rate and hoping my $300 loss becomes a $300 gain in the next week. But yeah that whole liquidate when you're at your lowest is fucky. I was $15 away from being liquidated on bitfinex, it would suck not being able to reinvest nearly half as much after a catastrophic fall

It was from a news site though and the fact was the naira was being devalued, thanks for letting me know, it was a troll title but I mean, it is true, those guys over there are into making money and they're tech smart they're gonna be able to dump whatever shares they have in naira $$ and put it into bitcoin while they can.
thanks :)

Bitcoin tech is fully flawed and unscaleable, the devs are retarded, come at me with rebuttals
