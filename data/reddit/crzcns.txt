When the customer scans your generated QR code they receive the payment address and the amount. So when you ring your customer up, a QR code is generated on your end and displayed on a screen facing the customer. The customer scans it and their app loads your payment address and payment amount. They send payment. The customer can use any wallet app they want. You want to set up an account with BitPay to handle things on your end (securing private keys, multiple multisig wallets if multiple kiosks) unless you want to get your hands dirty for such a large business. You would need a deeper understanding of the protocol to handle those things safely on your own.

Tx fees when I send a tx are based on priority, which is based on the input age, divided by tx size in bites.  
So I get paid out in a coinbase transaction. No fees, cool. When I go to spend my earnings from coinbase transactions, many small outputs are involved. When I go to purchase something, I am responsible for the fees required to process the large tx size made up of many small coinbase outputs. A coinbase tx may have only 1 txin so when I receive my coins I don't have to pay fees. When I go to move those coins made up of many tiny coinbase outputs, I still have to pay the fees calculated from a low value, large size tx. Make sense?

There is no difference in a one output to one output ratio. My point is that p2pool will have many more outputs, thus a larger tx size, thus higher fees.

But when I go to move what I'm paid it has so many outputs that it incurs larger fees. The outputs when I go to transfer them makes the transactions large enough to attract more fees, as opposed to getting paid out the same amount with a lesser amount of outputs.

We can measure this based on average number of outputs per payout. I may do the math on an example soon but the idea is to encourage decentralized mining. We can make p2pool easier and easier to use but at the end of the day if profit is not insignificantly lower, for profit miners will not act. I would argue that for a large hashrate it can be shown that the additional fees incurred due to large number of outputs would be significant over time. This proposal is interesting but would obviously take time to implement

This doesn't solve the p2pool usability issue, but I am interested. How would this be possible without using something like this  or another third party without controlling a large hashrate?
