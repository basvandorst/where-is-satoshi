Yeah, I contacted them, but I still think it is amateurish not to specify what went wrong or a suggestion on what to do.
As stated above I sent a copy of my passport, and its a new one so they can just scan it to see if there is anything wrong with it.

Thank you for your help, PM sent.
I know things have been hectic for you guys over the last few weeks, but you really should streamline your support and aml processes. Recently, I asked support about the different options of funding my account and I got some very strange replies. One answer was plain wrong and another seemed very unprofessional.
I don't know if that was due to language issues or whatever, but if you guys want to keep being a relevant exchange in the bitcoin world, you need to look at your support structure as well as the technical aspects. Mtgox is losing goodwill fast. I'm sure you have seen all the posts here, and in other relevant web forums, actively seeking an alternative to you guys because they are fed up with the poor support and casual attitude towards your customers. Yes, I know that MtGox has had a somewhat strained relationship with the bitcoin community for years and that you probably see this only as irrelevant noise while still being the big fish. The pond is getting larger though...
I am not writing this just to bitch and moan, I really would like for Mtgox to get its act together as I have traded there since 2011, and I still think it has the best interface and is perfect for my needs.

NP. Try some of these sites for tiny amounts of coin. I can't guarantee that they all work, as I just pasted it from an old notepad list I have.

Thanks for the link. I'll show it to people who are new and want to try it out. I don't use these services myself as I think they should be for newbies trying to get a hang of it. It is not worth those of us who got into bitcoin a while ago and already own several coins.

I have only had good experiences with Bitstamp, and they have quick customer service which is a plus for a newbie.

I work for a decently sized international company. We deal with five currencies daily; £, € and the Scandinavian Kroner. It costs us millions a year. Moving all business to bitcoin would save most of that expense, probably. I say probably, because we also speculate in the different currencies so maybe the 7th floor people will still have jobs ;)

FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the treasury department, released new money laundering guidelines not long ago that were positive to bitcoin. That does not mean that regulation might not come, but is a pretty positive sign for the legality of bitcoin.
You can show him this link from forbes to find out more:

I sent a scan of a government issued paystub. High quality and non-cropped.

Have they fixed the mess from the terracoin fork? I heard a lot of people was not able to get those back, but I haven't followed up on it.

Your wallet is is a file called wallet.dat which resides in the %appdata%\bitcoin folder. Type %appdata% in the start menu and find the bitcoin folder.
You can not use the same wallet file in more than one place, though you can export and import it.
A local client is not needed, but I personally would recommend having it as websites can be hacked and are bigger targets than your device. There are, however, several different malwares which target wallet files. One alternative is Blockchain.info which stores the wallet locally, but can be accessed from the website. It is free and simple to get a wallet there, and you don't need to fund it with BTC. Just be sure to carefully read the instructions and don't fund the wallet before you understand how it works.
In any case I would recommend searching for websites that give out tiny amounts of BTC for free and fund your wallet that way just to get a hang of how everything works before you spend your savings buying however much you want to invest.

Already played a bit and will continue to test. Thanks in advance if you send some this way :)

I sent a copy of my passport in a high quality pdf. Same with proof of residence, with the address clearly printed.

It took my latest deposit 6 days to clear, but I haven't bothered to check how long my bank took to send the transfer. I wouldn't panic yet.

Thank you for fixing this for me!

Bitcoin is the answer to the problem of sending funds quickly and cheaply over the internet. There have been several attempts to solve this, the most well known being paypal.
Bitcoin, unlike paypal, ISK, Linden dollars etc. is decentralized. No single entity controls it, and that is what separates it from other types of online payment options.
They are only worth something because people agree that they are. The first purchase made with bitcoin was a delivery of 2 pizzas for BTC 10.000 as an experiment to see if anybody had any interest in assigning a "real world" value to bitcoins. And that was the first true valuation of it and got the ball rolling to the point where we are today :)

I think some of the altcoins have been victims of a 51% attack. I seem to remember that's why BBQCoin disappeared. BBQCoin was just for fun though, and had very little hashing power on their network.
