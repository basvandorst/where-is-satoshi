A full node is part of the social bitcoin network that includes the developers, users and miners. If you can’t manipulate all of those at the same time, nothing will happen. If you can manage to pull that off, you should definitely do it. I think you’re confusing block consensus with social consensus. Yes, miners determine and validate the valid chain (block consensus) and that is where POW is required. But they are all under the strong influence of game theory. It’s the social consensus part that you need to worry about not the block consensus. Look at the history.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:04:57
Assuming you’re referring to social consensus, miners do not determine that. Full nodes do. A mining node just happen to be one type of full node. Therefore, as long as it’s relatively easy to run a non-mining full node (small blocks), you don’t have to worry about centralizing (=efficiently/profitably working) miners. Because they can’t solely determine the consensus.  If you meant block consensus, again, it’s not up to them to decide anything. There is no place for human motives or good will, “math” will rule over them, unless you managed to gain 51% of hash which is unlikely. So why worry about that?
@_date: 2019-03-06 03:54:12
It is. There are already many independent nodes operating. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 03:45:29
The miners are basically just workers. The centralization of miners is, therefore not as bad as centralization of full nodes(if it’s bad at all). A full node is not necessarily a mining node. A larger block would effectively make it impossible to run a full node for general bitcoin users thus casuing the centralization of full nodes. If miners centralizes that only means that they are doing their job in a place where it is efficient and profitable. That’s not bad at all, imho. But if full nodes are centralized, that paints a much worse picture.

Miners don’t control the bitcoin network, the token or the community. They just work for the token. It’s as simple as that. The bcash fork was the evidence that Bitcoin is in fact decentralized, because if it wasn’t, there would have been a simple one way upgrade from top to bottom rather than the fork with all the drama we all saw. And something can be both store of value and means of exchange at the same time. That’s just an observation of what bitcoin is actually doing today. There’s no room for personal opinions. Bitcoin is being used as both. That’s objectively true. You might think it’s not “successful” form of store of value, but you can never say it’s not store of value. Because value is being stored in bitcoin right now. We can use it as a means of exchange because we have the other unit of account; fiat. We convert bitcoin against fiat in real time and there’s no problem with fluctuations. But soon, bitcoin will also be a unit of account. It just doesn’t make sense now because one bitcoin is just too cheap for it to become uoa.

I suggest you listen to this podcast
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:35:05
couldn’t agree more
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:32:04
No problem! 
oh, if you don’t want to listen to the whole thing, 
Gali from hyperchange did a very good job of summarizations it. So I will leave the link here.

As the network (dev + user + miner) grows, it’s only natural that the price follows. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:41:38
evolution of an asset:
collectible &gt; store of value &gt; medium of exchange &gt; unit of account
You are talking about the final stage when we’re only in between collectible and store of value. You think it’s impractical because it kinda is right now. Using bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee will starts to make more sense when the network reaches its full potential in terms of both price and adoption. 
Right now, you should be here for the gain. That’s only logical. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:44:03
I didn’t mean it like “right now” lol. I’m not that delusional. But fundamentally, price volatility won’t matter because bitcoin don’t need to serve as a unit of exchange just yet. It will be like using a foreign currency for a while. You don’t pay fixed amount of bitcoin, but pay converted amount of bitcoin against your local currency. But once the price stabilizes and reachs its full potential, it will become a convenient unit of account. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:20:40
If those three questions you said yes to become a reality, then bitcoin will already have been a global currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:47:50
Yes. The local coins you’re talking about probably won’t just disappear. But it just doesn’t make sense for people to “invest” in them now or even care about them. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:31:04
If you see BTC as a currency reserve, then it will make less sense over time to hold and spend “localcoins” because bitcoin is already borderless and second or third layer solution will be widely adopted and functional.
