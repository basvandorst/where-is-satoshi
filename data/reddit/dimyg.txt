There are certain goods like food, shelter etc. that you can't do for long without buying them. The problem is that there will be no strong economic incentives to the producers of these goods, so even if you would like to buy them, there will be none.
Imagine that you are a house constructor. Let's assume that it takes two years to complete the construction. The cost of building the house is 100$ (equal to 100btc assuming 1btc=1$). You plan to sell it at 200$ and have a 100$ profit. 
But have in mind that every transaction is done with bitcoins. It takes 1 more year to find a buyer. The price of bitcoin is now doubled (1btc=2$). So the buyer gives you 100 btc (200$) and gets the house.  
What happened is that you have no profit from your economic activity. You had 100 bitcoins (100$) before building the house and now you still have 100 btc (200$). You would have exactly the same result if you just hold your bitcoins. 
This is an extreme example used to demonstrate the effect of price deflation caused by a fixed supply medium of exchange.

Pro deflation ideas are currently not widely accepted. This doesn't mean of course that they are wrong. I guess though, that they require some radical changes in each individual's mindset, in order to be successfully implemented in practice.

But if you can have more money than you currently have, by just holding your bitcoins, there is no reason to build a car factory.

Bitcoin is not going to compete with currencies as a medium of exchange. If it succeeds, it will be a financial asset like gold. Gold is a $7 trillion market. It is huge in comparison to bitcoin. Yet, no one buy things with gold. Its properties are not good for that. It has other properties that make it valuable. And I don't mean its shininess. It is a very deep and highly liquid market that can also be used as a store of value in times of crisis among others. Bitcoin has the potential to become gold 2.0 keeping the best properties of gold and adding a ton of new ones. Of course no one knows the future, but I'm quite confident that there is going to be some crypto-asset that will play that role. It might be bitcoin, it might be another one. Currently though, bitcoin leads that race.

Very interesting discussions, thanks for your citations.
The discussions are about how bitcoin can be used as "high powered money" against which "bank" notes can be issued. Transactions of the masses are being done with these notes (that can be other crypto-tokens) and big asset re-allocations are done with bitcoin transactions. Something like what gold was in the past, or the new money created by central banks is today (all considered). 
This reinforces my current belief that bitcoin's destiny (if it succeeds mainstream adoption) is to be a new store of value. An upgraded gold. 
This matches Charlie Lee's (founder of Litecoin) opinion (2013) according to whom bitcoin is upgraded gold. It stores value, it's easy to transfer, cheap to store and cheap to divide.

I understand your argument. But it brings to my mind a strange simile.
There is a man that wears an exotic outfit. When he does well and grows there is this outfit that constrains him. The more he grows the stiffer the outfit becomes until it becomes as solid as steel. At that point he has no choice but to stop eating and growing, no matter if there is plenty of food in his environment. He must starve enough until he feels comfortable in his outfit which has become soft again. And then he starts all over again trying to push his outfit to a somewhat bigger size each time. 
My point is that in a growing economy, price deflation creates incentives that prevent further growth without an obvious reason.

I agree. The blockchain is an exceptional invention. What I argue though, is the use of one of its applications (bitcoin) as a medium of exchange.
