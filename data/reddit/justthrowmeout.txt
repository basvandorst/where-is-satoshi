But as mass adoption of merchants occurs what is the force driving demand?   With every purchase made with Bitcoin, there is a resulting sell from the merchants which is diluting the value.  I guess in the end, currencies aren't going to work well as an investment vehicle.  The initial bubble was an anomaly.  I think we're moving towards a stasis of 100 or less.  Maybe even parity with the US dollar.  Imagine $1 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:35:33
I suppose so.  But I would think as merchants adopt consumers would follow.  Bitcoin is gradually taking off bit the price just declines.

@_date: 2014-04-11 08:48:58
But its being outlawed as a currency.  I can appreciate the complexity and usefulness of the network. But can you simply state a problem that it solves?  I would give you the idea of transferring money internationally but that is legally questionable since its not accepted to be a currency and there is no practical way to quickly convert bitcoin back to fiat without using an exchange.  The exchange ads an extra charge and the problem of market fluctuations.  In the end its easier and probably cheaper to just do a wire transfer.  Btw I've dine it converting money overseas to BTC to deposit it to my US account.  
I'm not saying the technology doesn't have future potential.  It does.  But as of now Bitcoin doesn't really solve any problems.

It can't function as a currency due to regulations.  Its not useful as a store of value because it fluctuates to much and is vulnerable to attacks or coin loss through various ways.  It's useful as a novelty item bit that's about it at this point.  Any potential use currently has a better alternative.  Honestly...what problem does it solve?  Its an interesting technology but it's a hammer looking for a nail.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:05:57
Oh come on.  It's not a currency now.  Not in the sense of currency being a store of value.  It's way to unstable.   It might be viable currency in a couple years but not now.

At any point in the appreciation of Bitcoin it seems there would be a point where you say "Shit, I made X dollars, I'm happy I'm gonna cash out before I lose it".

Agreed.  But I believe the question was a hypothetical about how could BTC be killed.
Hasn't Apple already banned it?  Anyways, if Windows, Google/Android and Apple ban it it will be relegated to the domain of Linux nerds and essentially killed.

It's only low relative to previous values.  Past values don't indicate what the future will bring.  ie.  maybe it's not low.
@_date: 2014-04-11 07:10:45
What's the reason?  Because you have faith?   The Valuenet rebranding will likely confuse most users and I'm guessing its an attempt to sweep Bitcoins  flaws under the rug.

I'm a Boglehead that has the majority of funds invested in index funds and don't do trading these days.  Huge fan of S&amp;P 500.  I'm being of two minds though.
  While I agree that indexing is your best shot to get a safe return, I also feel like timing really does matter.   The general wisdom is to not try and time the market, but if you bought at the wrong time your returns are not good.  I guess risk reward ratio.
I think his 1% fee assumed some mutual fund with a high fee ratio which I agree is absurd.
Regarding stock picking, I've picked a few winners without heavy scrutinization of their financials.  Just a good understanding of their products, value, the market and current PE ratios.  A few winners, I've picked that honestly seem like no brainers: Apple, Google, GE, Walgreens, Red Hat, Gilead, Berkshire Hathaway.    But as I've gotten older I've liquidated most of my gains and went into a balanced index approach through Vanguard.   Are we still in lol

It's a damn poor return any way you slice it.  Dividend reinvestment is messy in anything other than a retirement account with the calculation of cost basis plus factor in the tax due on any dividend income.  The guy makes a point.  Timing matters.

True story: I'm in Asia.  A foreigner hooked up with some gangsters girlfriend.  Said gangster was furious and contacted the employer of the foreigner.  He threatened that if the employer didn't pay him some restitution and also fire the employee he would start having "problems".  Not problems of violence or street crime.  Government problems like inspections, fines, fees, bureaucratic red tape.   It made me realize the gangs and the government are two sides of the same coin.
Oh and the super rich employer met the gangsters request.

Keeping your physical wallet on you is much easier for the average person then making sure they don't install any malware, making sure their system is up to date, firewalled, password protected etc.  Also people don't usually keep huge sums in their wallet.  They may/might in a bitcoin wallet.  I'm not saying this problem won't have a solution. In time it may but for now it's a big hurdle.  I hope it's overcome.

I often hear this but I would think in some situations getting a lawyer would look REALLY suspicous.  Example:
Let's say a man is with his wife at home one night and she has a heart attack so he calls an ambulance.  Ambulance arrives and she is dead.  Police soon arrive.  
Police are going to ask for a statement and the natural order would be to tell them that the wife had a heart attack and he called the ambulance and she died.  If the husband refused to speak to police without a lawyer wouldn't this seem extremely suspicious?  I would think this would provoke police to investigate further.

I've traveled the world a bit and learned some things about how other countries do things.  Most have the same problems.  The weird thing is when you see the crime that goes on in government and you see the behavior of gangs and then you see their interrelationship eventually you start to realize gangs and "respectable" government are essentially one and the same.  The line where one ends and the other begins is so vague it doesn't seem to exist.

This is all true but a bit of a sensationalist perspective.  The bitcoin system has some inherent security flaws that I can't see being solved.
If you lost your phone, your computer crashes, laptop is stolen...all your money is gone.  If you forget your password, all your money is gone.  If someone hacks your computer and gets your wallet and password.  All your money is gone.  No chargebacks.  No safety mechanism against fraud.  
In time these problems could be fixed but for now these security flaws will routinely chip away at bitcoins potential.  The average user is not savy enough to understand backing up your bitcoin and remembering your password.  Hackers are hard at work to hijack every type of system, grab your wallet key and send bitcoins to the address of their choice.  Bitcoins strenths are also it's biggest weaknesses that have yet to be overcome.
