This is an old thread, but let me tell you a story. I've heard this first hand from a friend of 20+ years. I fully trust him. TFWIW.
He was working on a PGP-based, new closed-source variant of encryption software for the corporate market during the early 2000s. This company (+ most workers) was located in the UK, while the main algo developer was outside UK.
They started testing and selling the initial version to close clients. Clients liked it, they starter rolling it into production.
Within a few weeks from this people from a UK alphabet soup agency came in, showed their IDs and demanded the source code .
They said the company can either co-operate or they will be shut down by "a lawsuit".
They also claimed the algo analysis of the source code will only be used for fingerprinting the output of the encryption code, not as an attack against the encryption.
The company talked with its lawyers, owners and eventually caved in.
My friend talked to several other developers at that time and said that this was a very common occurrence. Almost everybody gets visited (if their software is good/widespread enough).
What happens today, if your key-length is sufficient, code is tight and chosen encryption is mathematically attack proof?
You get shut down.
While I'll keep using protonmail, lavaboom, (insert the next newcomer here), I will not bet on the fact that any of them will be around for long...
None of the 5 eyes, EU or Switzerland is safe in terms of legal action and/or as a location of the servers. Just the financial secrecy leakage during 2008-2010 (not to mention server shutdowns) has proven this.
Possible places that might be untouchable by the NSA and it's ilk? Russia, China, North Korea, Iran. Good luck with those...

The Video is gone. Anybody have a title or a mirror for the video?
