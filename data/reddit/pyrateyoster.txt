Its a meme don't get butthurt bro lol. At least he made it over the bar.

stop grieving and get in, this is still a fledgling industry. And wherever this crazy train goes, its certain that money will never quite be the same again.

I finally wuit Facebook about a month ago, then crypyo comes knocking. At least Im getting some returns.

Oh shit not the shark trend!

I had to hold back loling in the coffee shop. Definitely one of the funniest memes Ive run into so far. Bravo xD

This is the kind of stuff that makes a newb like me uneasy about all of this. There is definitely a "fad" element to this explosion of interest, regardless of the revolutionary aspect of the tech. What Im wondering is how long will it last and what will remain.

Come back when youve acquired a quantum computer.

You're supposed to buy low and sell high, not the other way around! Learn from this for the future. Forget your fears and emotions, hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:49:28
haha you need a meme for that, like dropping a vase and catching it before it hit the ground. You're lucky you learned your lesson without getting burned!

After the shit Bank of America pulled in the recession, I cant believe people still bank there. Like hey we wrecked your economy and you paid for it, come bank with us!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:09
Thank you for your valuable insight...lol

Ride the roller coaster....

And you think those paper rectangles have value? Crypto has an upper hand in that no central authority can simply print more of it when they feel like. Also I have actually delivered to military bases, including Fort Knox, which had the least security of them all. There is no gold, and even if there was, it is as useless as virtual coin.

I'd gladly sell off my BCH, but I want to see where this dip goes before I do, would like to at least take advantage of the spike it got from Coinbase earlier if it goes there again.

Cant really "overthrow" the banking industry when they are adopting the tech themselves. Simply a revolution in money. The Rothchilds are on it.

This article is from 2013, thanks for the reminder ; ) HODL

My question is how would the IRS ever find out? I mean declaring capital gains on crypto you cash in is one thing but this seems to be tantamount to me helping a neighbor remodel his house and not reporting the money he paid me over a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:37
lol same here, luckily I have been doing some homework and hodled, even bought some on the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:51:27
Its junk but look at BCash, people will still support it and money will be made.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:27
This is the sharpest and most sustained recovery since the fall started though, I'm optimistic, went ahead and grabbed some ETH since it along with LTC seem to be on the same bounce.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:55:12
well now is the time to think about pulling the trigger, when you get down to it, this game is simple; buy low, sell high. The hard part is deciding if this is truly the bounce or if it will fall further.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:28:47
personally I increased my position in ETH this morning at 630. I would buy BTC now but as a relative newcomer, and the fact that I am happy with how my initial $75 investment has done over the past year I'm going to observe and take notes on this bounce.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:30:25
Im pretty sure it depends on how the currencies are trading against each other. Another thing to consider is transaction fees. For example I bought some ETN last night by purchasing LTC and then trading that because LTC was trading higher for ETN vs BTC and it didnt have the large transaction fee BTC currently has. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:32:22
Not sure about BTC but my LTC showed up in my Cryptopia wallet in less than an hour last night.

Glad that correction happened before Christmas.

Human nature will always turn out in the end. Im in it for both. The opportunity to make money is irresistable, however Im hoping its just a side effect of a new way to think about money. Blockchain is here to stay, but the currency itself has outpaced itself in value/attention to usefulness ratio. But there are many ideas in the pipeline. I find Litecoin to be far closer to being a practical payment method.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:55:51
Always a pleasant surprise when you pull out your couch cushion to find a few old linty bitcoins you dropped.

"Making" the appointment isnt an accomplishment. Not going to argue, Im from the south too, but yeah, a jackass is a jackass, at least Trump got voted in (by the electoral college).
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:12:41
Hodling since February 2017! I actually got in because I wasnt able to get all my money out after a transaction, the rest is history. Up, down, still hodling.

Bro you shoulda just left the keebler elf off that honorable mention list.
