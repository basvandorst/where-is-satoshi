that depends on time. In the current situation Bitcoin is around 457 USD which is very under valued. But if it grows too fast it will lose track and break in again. 
Finally it reflects the services and goods traded with Bitcoin plus speculation. To a certain degree it may be measured in the number of people and companies using it. That may finally be measured in the number of addresses and transactions. These two number are growing exponentially. Ie. it doubles every year roughly said so should the price. 
Lets say if the 2013 fair price was 100USD then it should be like this:
2013 - 100
2014 - 200
2015 - 400 (that matches the situation)
2016 - 800 ... 1600 ... 3200 ... 6400 ... 12800 ...
Because the adoption is an S-curve at some point this growth will go over in saturation and slow down. I think the Winklevoss were very good at estimating a fair price around 40,000 USD of the current value of the dollar. But finally it may be much more ...

I wonder why the statistical block rate of 1/10min will not be increased. It is clear that there is a lower bound that guarantees the network stability. But must it be as high as 10min? Maybe 5min in a first step would have been enough with the possibility for further increase.
@_date: 2015-06-14 11:26:59
The article is not really anti. It picks up two critical issues of volatility and missing regulation. But then it makes a wrong conclusion and speculates about Bitcoins survival. But the missing point is always the same: Bitcoin cannot be destroyed which means that Bitcoin will survive anything. Secondly the volatility will go back with more widespread adoption. This year 2015 the price level is already astonishingly stabil between 220 and 250 USD.
It makes the impression that the bigger banks still struggle with the qualities of Bitcoin.

Firstly the miners have already an interest just to take the txs with biggest fees.

There may be two processes to mitigate volatility in Bitcoin:
1. increased spread over markets and increased use should lower the price jumps due to the fact that quick price jumps are also an implication of fast communication between the market participants. If the group of market participants grows the communication process will be delayed and the volatility will cease
2. capital investors may start to control the market volume. In own interest for their investments  they will act as market makers and keep the price level fairly biased
With the background of point 2. the Winklevoss ETF and GABI are very important for the further price building.

If the wallet.dat is encrypted and was ever encryptet then the probability for theft is going down with the time as long as you never use it anymore and the password is not used anywhere else.
I would recommend to create a safe paper wallet and transfer the BTC to it.

I did some trading on LBTC. The platform is safe. Be sure to use 2factor authentication.  If you make a cash deal meet in a safe place with video surveillance.  As seller you need nothing else than a phone to release the funded bitcoins. As buyer you just need the transaction code and cash. Never go to a deal before the transaction has been funded. On meetup the buyer shows the seller the money .. then the seller releases the bitcoins to the buyers wallet and tells the buyer the tx code .. buyer verifies and hands over the the cash. 
I never had any problems so far.

Get BTC on the phone is very easy with modern wallets like Mycelium.

You trust the banks more than yourself due to that you do have a serious lack of information. Encrypt your wallet.dat (standard function in Bitcoin-QT) and make several backups (cloud, USB stick, anything else).

There was alreadz a similaar dicusion on bitcointalk.org. Finally 'bits' seems to get most acceptance. There are two more crucial points.
Secondly changing the unit name create inacceptance and is not understood by the average Joe. I remember how long it took for the EUR to be in peoples ind instead of calculating bck to the old currency.
Thirdly bits does not sound too technical. The more technical the unit name sounds the worse its acceptance is. That for milliBTC or kiloBit would also be very bad. 
1000 bit seem to be an acceptble amount of value which is around 33 US cent or 27 EUR cent - seems resonable. Finally when the value increases there is enough space without changing the unit. Next level will be at 1 USD = 1000 bit. And then 1 USD = 10 bit --- sounds great.

Money laundering is a serious issue for Bitcoin (and all other cryptocurrencies, fiat money and finally all kinds of movable assets). 
But let's see the truth. It is more easy for any crime investigator to follow Bitcoin transactions than any paper cash which currently makes out a big part of money laundering activities. Finally it is just a question of tracing the transaction path in the publicly available blockchain. Since nobody is able to buy big amounts of Bitcoin on the black market today it is not appropriate for money laundering.
In this special case the buyer and PP account owner maybe would buy some BTC (which is doubtful already due to the money laundering surveillance of PP). But then he is in the situation as before: He must explain where the money comes from as soon as he starts to spend the coins.

The blockchain is just a distributed, historized, partition tolerand database for small data. Cooperations are intrinsically centralized. Due to that its hard to imagine an useful application of the blockchain for  companies (distributed vs cebtralized). A distributed ledger like Bitcoin seems to be the obvious application for the blockchain. Value distribution simply requires consensus which is forced by the blockchain.
Another interesting application may be decentrralized voting systems.

they can - but does it make sense? if they do they will lose secrecy of their transactions, blockchain will be used in a centralized way (not open for anyone) and the banks could simply use a trusted centralized clearing service instead.
one major point with Bitcoin (and the blockchain) is the open market structure for everything. Anyone can participate, anyone can drive a miner and nobody controls the structure or transacction costs. For any change a 51% majority of all miners is necessary. Banks are legacy constructs working centralized and charging high fees - they have no interest in costless, trustless decentralized money systems. That for many of them are working hard against Bitcoin

Indeed this is not a problem. The correct statement should be: 
5-10 Bitcoin core developers contribute updates to the code base right now. The changes are suggestions which can but must not be accepted by the miner majority. Anyone can fork the code base and make more changes which can but must not be accepted by the miner majority.
To say that Bitcoin is controlled by 10 people is not true.

no the logic is straight forward
as we know Core was maintained and developed by Hearn and Andresen. Then they took in more developers which started to follow different interests. Instead of making their own branch they took over the Core main code branch in a hostile act. Due to the network effect it is not easily possible to replace Core with a different code version like XT or Classic. So the now defacto Core developers are responsible for what will happen against the will of Hearn and Andresen and against the will of a majority of the users and payment providers.

"legal unclarity" has no impacts on the hashing distribution. ETH and DAO was a very different case... basically the result of a highly complex system which has not being tested thoroughly.

Programmers and developers are mostly graduated people. Why shouldn't they be able to study and understand the few concepts used by economists in this context. (Just remember one economy professor who predicted Bitcoins end mid of 2014)
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:48:54
Probably you just use the words economics and code as some ideological pattern without understanding the real meaning.

BitcoinXT has been discussed with too much emotions. It is time to see tha fact:
 - blocks are getting full recently; so there must be a solution to prevent the fees rising up
 - BIP100 gives the miners power over fundamental dynamics of the Bitcoin network which is inherently risky
 - BitcoinXT provides a solution that solves the blocksize problem and is near to the memory, network speed growth
the only problem with BitcoinXT was and is that it has been introduced without any marketing or preparation. but is that really a reason not to use it?

the private key for Mycelium is not encrypted anyways so that anybody and any app can read it - but since this does not seem to be a problem for 99.9% of Mycelium users it seems to be unlikely the root cause
it is more likely that the passphrase has been read from a copy&amp;paste buffer, a piece of paper or a file

The chances are good that PayPal extends its services for Bitcoin in the near future. Remember that PayPal is just a online payment service provider. When Bitcoin expands more they'll have a need to adjust their business case. Probably they'll become an offchain payment provider.

Even if nobody wants to trade Bitcoin it may be used for notary service. I can write a scientific paper, calculate the hash value and put in into the Bitcoin blockchain so that I have a undeniable proof of being the first one.
Anyways your definition of intrinsic value is very interesting - by far better than many others. Mine would be more process oriented: "Intrinsic value is the benefit it produces by using it".
