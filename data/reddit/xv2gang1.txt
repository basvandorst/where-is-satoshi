How can a bitcoin wallet provides the address without properly stores and backups the private key?This is big mistake! It's not an ordinary bug. How is the whole software designed?! 
For Hardbit, only if the device has verified the encrypted private key with the password and received the confirmation info of successful backup ,then can the user see his address and start collecting Bitcoin. This is so basic!

1 "Illegal" or "Legal" is not a criteria to judge if people in China would like to do somethin or not. Fake goods are illegal, tax evation is illegal, prostitution is illegal, but they are so popular. Donation is legal, R&amp;D is legal, but they are so minor.
2 Bitcoin is classified as "goods" in China. That means , it's totally out of control of China central bank or Bankingregulation Commission. Everything happened with Bitcoin is legal instead of illegal. every merchant has the right to price potato in tomato,and they are free of taxing.
3 There are  2 main reason why Bitcoin payments is not so popular in China:
(1)Anyway China is a 3rd world country, most of it's population is not well-educated and updated with the world. So , most of the shop bosses don't know how to play with Bitcoin(On which we are working for a solution--- a easy of use Bitcoin charging system);even if a shop opens Bitcoin payments , few customer would use that sulotion.
(2) Chinese banking system is much more convenient than western countries. Thanks to the monopoly of banking by government, we have Unionpay ,which automatically connects all the bank cards with reasonable fees ; Alipay and Tenpay are free compared to Paypal's high fees;So Bitcoin has not so much advantage compared to in western countries.
Thus, the stopping of Alipay and Tenpay, opens a very big potential market for Bitcoin, this is really a good news. You will see shops in tourist sites accepting Bitcoin soon.

Good Point！
Actually without Satoshi, the Bitcoin.org is not a good leader for  the whole Bitcoin society.
To change this situation is not that difficult, move these IP finding addresses to Bitcoin.conf, and let the user change them by their own will. 
Anybody who makes a new IP finder can broadcoast his server address to Bitcoin society, and users can freely switch to any IP finders by them selves.
And, for big nodes like pools, they sould definitely kill these codes and put their IP address directly into the params sheet.

There's another article in bit-sky.com in Chinese:"Currency has more use value for bad people than good people", I'll translate that article and stick to bitcoin group.
For poor and good people, the best way is to buy some Bitcoin like 10% of their property and wait for the rich people either corrupted or not to push the price up ,and then living quanlity is improved.

The system only sets the lowest fee.
Miners will select the higherst fee/kb transactions for their block.

another vapourwire.
Not that easy to make one.
How about electricity supply?
How long does it need to sigh a tx?one hour?
We use dual core 1G CPU, and the signing last for seconds...
