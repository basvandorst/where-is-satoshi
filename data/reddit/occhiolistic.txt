I'm honestly in the same boat. The more I learn, the less any side makes sense. I'm left trying to decide the more plausible scenario by seeing which angle has fewer contradictions, rather than the most verifications. After doing the mental "math," I'm currently left with maybe two less contradictions to the view that Wright was an integral part of bitcoin's origins. The linking of Wright to Nguyen to JVP and Ian tells me they're either part of the Satoshi team playing a bizarre game, or a team of scoundrels up to something.
Whatever the hell is in play, we're likely seeing only about a fifth of the puzzle, upside down, in a dark cave, muddled with extra pieces from another puzzle. 
But something about Ian's posts just rub me the wrong way more than anything else I've read...

That's almost certainly this Nguyen girl that's been mentioned as an employee of Wright.

Cool story bro, but the dox'ing method is a little too CSI: Cyber and holds a weak understanding of networking.

Maybe some are friends of his, maybe some have been bribed, maybe some believe Wright truly is Satoshi and are buying anything he's selling, maybe he's selling the truth. At this point, I think the most plausible assumption that can be made is -- that there is so much, how should I put it... 'borderline retarded shit' going on, that either **a)** someone has poisoned the water supply or **b)** there is a conscious effort to spread misinformation by at least one person, and a number of people are falling into his/their trap, whatever the hell that is.

They'll likely see more articles about his failure to prove anything.

Master troll causes mind fuck of the year. No one really has any idea what the hell we just witnessed.
Widespread response to Wright and everyone associated with him: 
The prophetized great rustling...

One may decide that the development of crypto-currency is its own reward, while a centralized document storage system isn't special and needs to pay the bills. One may decide to release bitcoin for free while mining what may someday be worth half a billion dollars. Nothing can be deduced here.

Pray tell, what sound logic have you found on the autobiography of Satoshi to know his character? Enough to know his character in such scope and detail that you know he never sold trivial software in order to buy something?  
I am not excusing anyone. I do not believe Wright to be the main actor behind bitcoin. I do, however, know what the fuck logic is.

What a fucking waste of time. So it now seems this Ian character is setting up [what I imagine to be] the ensuing failure of Wright to prove anything at all as excusable and meaningless. I can't help but cringe at this dramatic, grammatically flawed, prose. Furthermore, this CARS nonsense he keeps using is a trust system for ensuring certificates, not ensuring opinion pieces no one can verify. 
If Wright turns out to be what he claims, Ian isn't helping his cause or the community's.

This article wasn't even proof read and doesn't have any more evidence to back its claim than Wright has shown to back his claim.
