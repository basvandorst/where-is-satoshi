anyone and everyone who truly believes in it and passes it along to others
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:59:05
Just do some searching, this exact question is asked every 3-7 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:40:36
Look awesome. Great job 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:45:09
I could wish for nothing more than for that to be the case 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:05:58
What's the lite coin news??
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:50:13
I think I am just going to send from my personal account to the paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:36:08
I did use that but I kept getting the error about insufficient funds so I finally just cleaved off a bit to send 
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:49:43
Would have loved to (wanted to get one myself) but the party is Sunday so I don't think I can swing it on such short notice 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:55:00
What possessed you to even take the time to type up this complete nonsense? Was the excitement of the rise not enough for you? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:38:47
Yea so it will be easy as pie. Just gottta get home to make he move. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:44:45
Yup I'll be saving copies for sure 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:15:19
hmm so buy through and atm and then deposit onto a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:41:07
Can't I just send from my trezor to the paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:08:57
Yea ATM fees are rough. Learned the hard way my first time around. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:44
Just wait 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:13:50
Don’t gamble with money you don’t have. Sucks to be in a shit position, but you dug your own grave. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:12:47
Where are you sending for 50¢, not being sarcastic? Seriously would like to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:11
Look great, awesome job. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:42:09
I get that message as well then it allows me to enter my pin and log in. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:27:29
Thanks for the reply. I'll give it a shot. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:59:04
Thank you. 
I downloaded an app called learn python and it's very informative. I'm still not even crawling but it's interesting and served in a palatable manner on the app. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:18:41
Awesome. Congrats on the home and the soon to be family to fill it 
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:47:57
I assumed the same. I guess I'll just bite the bullet 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:39:16
Keep sinking, I'll keep buying 
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:26:40
My first 3-4 transactions took roughly a week. WAiting on a few others now. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:11:58
That's my plan. Buy buy buy, then hold as long as it takes. If it works out it works out. If not, I have thrown away a few thousand dollars on much less in the past.  
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:56:26
No. they will have to pry my wallet from my dead cold lifeless hands 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:45:02
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:02:29
Can you set buy and sells on coinbase mobile or is it only on the website?
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:40:44
Thank you. I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:57:34
How did they gain access to your blockchain account?
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:51:52
Quick question. I plan on buying through coinbase, is that advisable? Can I move my coins after I purchase them?
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:59:30
At this time coinbase seems like the most convenient way to get started. I plan on looking into alternate sources soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:08:56
That was my initial feeling, but the sentiment seems to be buy. I would kick myself if I didn't and missed a huge opportunity 
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:54:17
Any chance you can point me in the right direction? Not asking for a blueprint, just a rock to grab hold of to start the ascent. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:15:07
I'll have to order one!
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:28:31
I plan on buying and holding for the long haul. Just nervous a couple hundred here and there may not be enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:13:41
Is this something that is possible? Are there people presently working on this? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:30:29
That's awesome 
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:31:36
Ehhh doesn't sound like the best idea 
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:03:12
7-10 days. Don't worry they will come. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:30:58
I've been searching around and from what I read it is a possibility the price will drop making btc worthless. I guess I misread. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:21:15
I would assume to buy and sell coin? Or maybe he's just like me and feels the constant compulsion to log in flick up then leave the app multiple times a day. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:07:18
So does this mean I should not move my coin to my trezor whenever it arrives hopefully within the next few days
