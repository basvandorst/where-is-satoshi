Could’ve just directed to bitcoin for beginners. :\ let the folk ask their question
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:52:11
I personally use cash app.
My father uses Robinhood.
I suppose it’s all preference, also we’re both beginners so that’s what we’re using of now

Repsbro thanks for asking this! I’ve recently gotten into bitcoin myself and have my money still in cashapp for now. I need to find my License to validate my identity lol. Learned a lot though! Thank you!! And good luck

Try CashApp or Robinhood?
*update* If you want to send to your wallet try cash app. They allow you to withdraw and deposit. However Robin Hood still doesn’t have that option yet.

Hmmm... I can make them for you (:

Why so negative? We don’t need that here.

The few times it’s been down has been my fault for having bad/poor connection. Maybe try relaunching app/

Each of my paychecks I put $25-50 when I can I put more. I do what I can. It’s not much but it’s being stacking up (: Good Luck!
