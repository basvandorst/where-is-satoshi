How long does it take for a transfer from a hardware wallet to coinbase? Say I wanted to sell some I wouldn’t want to lose out on a high price waiting for it to clear.

I have one near my house I thought it was neat when I first saw it a few years ago. Never invested in bitcoin until 2 months ago sadly. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:53:10

@_date: 2017-12-10 07:31:23

@_date: 2017-12-14 00:06:58
Well I wanted to separate different amounts into different wallets for different uses. Oh well thanks for the help!

I came for the money and stayed for the Tech.... but if I make more money in the mean time I won’t be upset either. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:09:25
Yea  I currently have a spread sheet but figured multiple wallets would be less work. I’ll look into some hardware wallets

Which fork specifically? They had one planned a while ago but it was canceled 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:53:34
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:03:19
I thought I had to buy a full bitcoin as well. I did some research and realized I can buy tiny amounts. Now I own some coin and have doubled my money. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:51:47

Forks represent changes to the bitcoin protocol that make previous rules valid or invalid. Cryptocurrency forks are merely protocol upgrades, and there are two types of blockchain forks that bitcoin enthusiasts refer to: a soft fork and a hard fork.
Both types of forks can be radical changes to the underlying protocol, but they have two key differences. A soft fork is a rule change that is backward compatible; which means the new rules can still be interoperable with the legacy protocol.
In contrast to this method, a hard fork enables a rule change to the software, but it does not have backward compatibility. This means a hard fork is a permanent split from the legacy rule-set, or version, of the blockchain before the fork occurred.

I use my debt card seems to be quicker than bank transfer but it has a lower limit

Coinstar has been adding this to a bunch of kiosks. They just added it near me last week!
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:30:29
No it’s cash only but I guess you could exchange your coins for cash via coin star and then cash to bitcoin. Hopefully they add the change to bitcoin option soon.

Say you had this when/If Zimbabwe’s issues ended and their money became valuable again. would you be rich or would they say those bills are no longer valid?

Obviously photoshopped no one in their right mind could resist peeling it.
