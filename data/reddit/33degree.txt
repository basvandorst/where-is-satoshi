Are alternative gold based currencies legal in California too or is just internet money?

This post is called a "false rescue". You pretend to be the victim of someone who is coming out and exposing the truth. Bitcoin is a fraud.

Whoever "Satoshi" is, they're really having a fun time separating you guys from your money. First the over night China sell off, now this? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:15:36
Wow. Ironic. I wonder if the CEO was part of that China pump and dump fraud that skimmed millions off the bitcoin market.

I just hope we can figure out a way to use bitcoin to bring down carbon emissions. Maybe if we can liquify bitocin somehow we'd be able to engineer a bitcoin vaccination that reduced the population by 10-15%. There are big things ahead for bitcoin, once the Gates Foundation starts doing all transactions exclusively in BTC, we can finally put an end to global warming.

Funny you should mention that. There was a guy saying that was the plan back in 2005: 
"Bitcoin".... aka The Amero.

Bitcoin is a fraud. Everyone that just lost money, understand that you lost it because there was a coordinated sell off. This drop was a COORDINATED FRAUD. 
This is what happened: A bunch of big money people bought up bitcoins to inflate the price to $1000. They created the hype train and the ridiculous, fake value to entice the normal joe on the street to buy in. When they thought the bubble was sufficiently big enough, they pick an arbitrary story/new article to use as an excuse to sell-off their position. That's how the stock market works, that's how bitcoin just got robbed.
If you don't realize that this drop is a manufactured scam, you will always be taken advantage of. THIS DROP WAS INTENTIONALLY CRAFTED. Remember that. This is a life lesson. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:47:20
BITCOIN IS A FRAUD. Wake up people. That bubble just burst because a group of big money holders dumped their position. China blocking bitcoin caused it to lose half it's value? NO IT DIDN'T. The sell-off holders used that information/story as the excuse for the dump.
No one even knows who Satoshi is! What if he made bitcoin in order to create and pop bubbles? Isn't that possible? What if it's one big fucking scam? Did any of you think of that?
I love the idea of bitcoins and I think that someday they could be great. But RIGHT NOW, they are speculative weapons being used to separate you from your money. That's exactly what happened today and if you don't see that, you'll continue to be taken advantage of. 
Stop circlejerking in this fucking sub and wake up. You can still support bitcoins but be realistic about it. Until we find out who "Satoshi" is, we have to assume he has bad intentions. Because why else would he be keeping himself anonymous at this point. Don't trust anyone who won't tell you their REAL name.

You've left out the most important difference between gold and bitcoins: You can hold gold in your hand. If the power goes out. If the government decides they don't like bitcoins anymore, you can be easily separated from them. No one has to come to your house and fight you for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:10:34
You dumbasses. Bitcoin is a bubble that's going to EXPLODE. It's been hijacked by asshole Wall St. bankers. Just like the whole fucking country and economy. FUCK YOU GOLDMAN SACHS. FUCK YOU JPMORGAN. You ruin everything for everyone. Do not buy a bitcoin for $1000 dollars, that's inflated.
Why can't we just throw those criminals in jail so we can all have a normal, stable money system. How about some gold-backed dollars like it fucking should be. I'm sick of fucking these bankers robbing everyone.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:34:36


Lol. This is the first day of the sell off. How could you possibly "debunk" anything with one day of information? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:29:35


You're right on this point. But let's not forget the case of Lavabit and all the other major email providers. They were subpoenaed for their keys. They are going to crush this lavabit guy under legal fees for destroying his service instead of giving up the keys.
Will that happen to you or me, probably not. I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:55:52
God fucking dammit. If BOA is into bitcoin, they have an idea of how to manipulate that shit. Bitcoins are about to be hijacked by Wall St.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:33:53
Why do you think that bitcoin went from $1000 to $500 *overnight* a few weeks ago? Do you understand what happened?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:13:42
What are the benefits? You can't even buy things with them yet. You buy things in a dollar amount and transfer those dollars as bitcoins.
Bitcoins are a *speculative asset*. This was proven today. There are big money people investing in bitcoins to raise the price artificially. They are then looking to dump these and make a killing. Bitcoin is a weapon.

If the electricity goes out, it doesn't matter how many wallets you got backed up.

I love the idea of bitcoins but every single point Schiff made was valid. I know that everyone thinks bitcoin is this "decentralized" libertarian currency but that's a bunch of bull. Bitcoin IS centralized. An anonymous dude named "Satoshi" has centralized a vast majority of the coins. No one knows who this guy is. 
Don't buy bitcoins at $1000 a piece. That's inflated.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:13:19
I'm going off this post. 
It's funny to me that when I'm in the ACTUAL bitcoin forums people are very suspicious of what's going on and are looking for answers to some important questions. There's obvious shady shit going on. But when I come to the reddit forums, everyone is circlejerking each other with the bitcoin lube and singing the praises of a currency the government can't touch. That's not the case.
Please see my other response to the other guy in this thread. Bitcoins ARE NOT anonymous and "decentralized" doesn't mean what everyone here thinks it means.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:18:16
You don't think that when a huge money investor buys up or sells off a big sum of bitcoins it has an effect on the value of your wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:02:48
I think everyone on the bitcoin hype train is confused. The ForEx market is "decentralized" in that there isn't a single clearing house or central bank that runs it. That doesn't mean governments can't manipulate and control it. That doesn't mean a country can't decide to peg their currency to a fixed value. Obviously, bitcoin can't be pegged but who's to say that the American government wouldn't peg the dollar (or any other country for that matter) to bitcoins? And the vast majority of the coins are held by one dude, so they are literally centralized in his hands. What he does will determine what happens to bitcoin and he's never even shown his face.
The point I'm getting at here is that I see "decentralized" being thrown around the internet like it means bitcoins are immune from the control of the government or a central bank. It doesn't mean that, and people who buy bitcoins thinking that they are anonymous or that the government can't touch their money are sadly mistaken. It's 10X EASIER for the government to control your money. They can pass a law that outlawed bitcoins tomorrow and everyone would be fucked. They did it with e-gold. They could turn off the internet and separate you from your money with a flip of the switch and "Oops! Look at what the Chinese hackers did."
I love the idea of bitcoins but people are just buying into this way too easily. PROCEED WITH CAUTION PEOPLE. Don't buy 1 fucking bitcoin for $1000. It could be worth 50 cents tomorrow if "Satoshi" wanted it to be.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:43:41
Your currency has been hijacked people. Bitcoins belong to the elites now.
