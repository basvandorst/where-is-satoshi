eh, not really. that money ends up getting paid to employees, contractors, businesses, etc - it all pretty much returns to the economy. it doesnt just disappear.

no, its called fact...
for example, in 2011:
* govt revenue: $2.3 trillion
* govt spending: $3.6 trillion
taxes collected don't just disappear.

The irs is not any sort of disbursement agency
Did you forget about social security, Medicare, infrastructure spending, military spending, the gazillion federal departments, etc.....?
Are you really that dense

Selling plastic baggies isn't illegal. Selling heroin is.
Running a bar isn't illegal. Laundering money through a bar is.

governments aren't 5 year olds. outsmarting them on some sort of technicality isn't going to work in the long run.
a guy selling "clear plastic baggies" for $20 each that happen to be filled with illegal drugs is going to be prosecuted for selling drugs.

not quite understanding your question
if you want to have a plumber come in two weeks (and they are a economically "rational" actor, not a bitcoin believer) and wanted to pay them with 1 bitcoin - they don't know whether that's going to be $200 or $600.
But more importantly when GE sells thousands of jet engines to be delivered over the course of many years, they want to price it in USD, or local currency, or a combination of both, or with a basket of hedged currencies... but no one would ever want to price that contract in btc.
