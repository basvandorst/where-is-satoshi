LTC's all time high is ~$197, way above the current ~$156.

This sentence would have made no sense 10 years ago. What a time to be alive.

There is noise in the data, mostly from altitude changes. Other noise is bias in the sensor, HVAC, etc, but primarily altitude. We do some statistical analysis to quickly get the clean trend information - is the pressure rising or falling? 
Getting exact, altitude-adjusted pressure isn't so easy but we're working on it.

Haha, you're almost exactly correct. Actually we are already open source, and we are growing reasonably quickly. However, I still need to scale 10-100x before the density of measurements produces a dramatically better weather forecast, so I need a more fair value proposition than just kindness. 
But you did kind of hit the nail on the head: we've collected 600M measurements so far, mostly by being open source.

Amazing. Thanks! :)

We will process the data internally and use it as the primary input to new weather models. We will sell the outputs of those models weather forecasts, to specific industries that buy high - accuracy weather forecasts. Examples are agriculture companies looking to optimize crop output, solar &amp; wind power companies looking to reduce risk, etc
