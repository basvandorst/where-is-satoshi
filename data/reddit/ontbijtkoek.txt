Maybe a noob question but when you pay your pint with BTC you always have to wait a minimum of 10min for the first confirmation right? 
I transferred some BTC between wallets and had to wait ~1h before it appeared in the destination wallet.
This is not very practical in a shop/bar, how does this work in practice?

Why is that? I expect that shop owners would like to know if its the real deal 100% of the time. Most shops also check for counterfeit bills even though the risk on fake is very small.
Not trying to dis you, just genuinely interested in the way this will works.

rarely-used metric measurements...  ah, we might have a culture difference here. I'm from Europa so metric is not rare at all, infact everybody knows for example what 'milli' is (milli-grams, milli-meter, milli-liter) it is very common knowledge. You might be right about the 'micro', that is not often used in every day life (I do as an engineer, but i guess that is not typical). 
In the 'bit' naming convention, what is the idea when this becomes a large value, milli-bit? 
I do hope they/we will stick to the milli, micro, nano etc because it is a very good system. Why re-invent the wheel?   
ps. congratulations on your cake day

Why again? Because for me it is completely clear what a mBTC is but I would not know what a bit is, 1/1024 BTC? 1/8 BTC? And since BTC will go to the moon, there is always; milli, micro, nano, pico, atto, zeta

Its mBTC, uBTC etc. 
Using 'kbits' will be confusing for most people

When installing wallets you should probably be aware of phony wallet apps that steal from you, how can you tell if the app wallet is legit? Newbie BTC user here.

Is there a basic 'bitcoin userguide' somewhere with do's and don'ts? 
I've recently started using BTC and find it very easy to make mistakes with tools, wallets, markets etc.
I read posts about people losing 12BTC due to an unknown reason and the reaction of other Redditors is in the line of; "oh thats a bummer man, better luck next time" and "easy come, easy go". This might be true if you mined hunders of coins a while ago but if you just bought your BTCs for 1k$ a piece its a different story. I see this as big pitfall for BTC, whats the opnion here? Again BTC newbie, so I might be seeing it all wrong.

So you want some regulation... hmm ;)

Downvoted for being right, ha.
Have my upvote!

Thats the beauty of the system, in your example one would say; "look what I got for 100nano!"
Take note that the transfer from milli -&gt; micro -&gt; nano will take place rarely (e.g. like harddisk sizes) so you have enough time to get used to it.

Hope you are joking;
"A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds." 
Makes a lot of sense?!?
Why invent new and totally random units every time when there is a perfectly good future proof system available? I've been reading a bit (no not a uBTC) and see that it is a cultural thing ( 
We lost a Mars Orbiter over silly unit mistakes, let not walk in to that same pitfall again.
At current time go kbits, please.. I can hear the discussions; 100k for night out drinking!! Jeez I only make 50k a year so I better take my good old dollars instead! You and your fancy Bitcoins." 
Come to think about it this can harm the acceptance of BTC.
Glad to see mBTC on the sites.

I don't see the advantage, why first use 'bit' which is divide by million and then use a next step that is divide by hundred?! Milli, micro, nano, pico, femto etc etc is all a factor of 1000, super simple and straight forward.
How difficult was it to go from MB to GB to TB with your harddrive, all factor 1000 bigger, exactly the same system but in the other direction.
Everybody who has ever worked with capacitors for example knows how effective this system is (1 Farad cap is very large, an average cap in your smartphone is 100nF).
In the 'bit' system we would now have to use 100000 bit as a reasonable value to put into your phone wallet when you go out drinking. To me that is error prone, a typo is easily made, 100mBTC MUCH better ;)

In practice you will only mention the prefix like we do today;
"so you make 50k a year, good for you!"
"I bought this 2nd hand car for 8k"
"my old harddisk was 80gigs"
"So this new T-shirt is only 80micros, great deal!"
Its already happing in my office; "good rate today, just bought another 500milli's"
Please don't introduce another made up unit, the metric system has proven itself, lets use it.
I understand it can be difficult for US citizens ( but it is really very convenient.

I'm still on iOS so if anyone can recommend a wallet that would be great.
