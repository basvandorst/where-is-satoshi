So I could say oh hey I wanna spend $250 if BTC price hits $9,999? But that’s only if I have USD sitting on Coinbase Pro?

Thanks for the detailed reply bro. So you’re saying if I convert some BTC to USD, I can just withdraw all of that to my bank free of charge?
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:42:31
What do you mean specifically by set orders?
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:41:39
It was debited from my bank on 7/8 but still doesn't show up on coinbase pro now (7/9). Is this normal?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:22:46
For sure. At least it'll *probably* get into coinbase pro about the time I get paid (next thursday), so I can start investing that 1k USD then AND start the next 2 week transfer
*nervous chuckle*

Just HODL and it will get above 13k sometime
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:31:46
Is this something you set up on Coinbase Pro? If so could you give me a step-by-step instruction?

I'm picking up my ledger nano x from the post office this morning and transferring my BTC. That's a start. What exchange do you prefer over coinbase?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:17:32
So you’re saying I don’t have access to the 1k I transferred to coinbase pro for another 5-12 days? Even though it’s out of my checking account? That’s kinda fucked to be honest. My 1k USD is literally just sitting in limbo lmfao
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:36:25
Oh hell yeah. That's awesome! Thanks again, really appreciate you!
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:49:34
You’re awesome for helping me!! Seriously! 
So it says payout date is 7-17... Jesus lol

Flash sale!
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:49:52
I need to know this, guys. I bought a lot and haven’t sold at all and most of my BTC/Ethereum is on my ledger nano x
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:43:17
Yeah what the fuck happened there.
