@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:08

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:55
it seems like theyre getting back insanly fast
edit: ok i dont even know, the site is fucked so hard right now...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:45
Its all about bitcoin dude
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:12:50
What? Just speaking the truth, if you want to continue having bitcoin as a payment system there have to be changes asap
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:23
why just why is this still locked
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:58
Thats what I think aswell
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:13
Haha I already went a half out @ 10900€ and waiting for a dip...
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:43
alooooot of traffic
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:56:19
you will be dead when this time comes
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:01:37
so you would say his coin is just getting that big of a pushup because of all the newcomers getting into the scene, who have no clue whats going on?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:57
im waiting for a nice dip since this morning aaaaand got nothing.....
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:13:30
but how can we react that this shit is not happening right now?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:09:26
So you think there is more of a drop to come before NYE?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:04:44
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:36
youre retarded
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:39
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:27:40
I‘m pretty sure there will be a correction going on the following weekend
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:06:33
My money is stuck in another transaction thats why I‘m mad af right now 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:26:00
"accidentally" yeah ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:38
this is making me sweat
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:09:14
It will slowly die out if this high fee shit doesnt stop
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:32
Its a hard fork they did there, nothing to do with the regular one
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:51:45
nobody knows
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:20
you got all right 10/10
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:07:34
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:54:28
I guess you need to wait some more time, since almost all exchanges (except coinbase ofc this fucktards) have to deal with heavy traffic these days
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:16
come at me "redditor for 2 days"
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:40
OMFG THEY JUST FUCK AROUND LIKE THEY WANT TO
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:01
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:36
yeah man but look at this  - once the trades keep going again you know urself whats happening to this 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:41
dude if they would enable it, the prices would go ham!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:00
the dip already appeared
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:01
So you would say that only the human brain is able to calculate and react quickly enough instead of perfect algorythms?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:22
I would recommend bitcoin.de
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:08:26
So tell us what you think is best for advanced Users?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:47
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:26
thats sad, because RV is creating alot of fucking hype around him
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:02:11
You could tell us where youre from?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:32
so why would you tell us?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:08:14
Just exactly whats happening right now hahahah
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:04
gdax going crazy, wait a bit
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:49
ahahha nobody will give a free $7000 away or smth
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:16:03
You just have to watch that BCH prize to know whats going on next...I personally think its not done yet, there is more to come, hodl tight.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:11
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:55
Sure segwit&amp;ln would do a massive job, but whats the point of it if nobody implements and uses this features
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:26:13
Check 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:34:12
I think you could be right...
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:21:28
You cant refund bitcoins once theyre transferred
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:35
Maybe GDAX going down within the next 10mins?��
Edit: alright, it happened just as I wrote this hahahah
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:38
That man should be heard!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:52
Alright Mr. Sherlock you know whats going on
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:34
get back to your wnb subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:54
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:49:11
do you see the price of gold go lower and fail just because everyone is using it as an investment? think twice...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:13
Send this guy some brain
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:44
Could you explain your thoughts a bit more? Not quite getting what youre saying...
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:04:29
Nice mum, would not only eat that cookie hehehee
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:18:32
Where ya from?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:22
yeah dude you're one kind of a fast thinking huuuuman
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:32:59
Whats the point of doing this? Just wondering
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:55:12
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:50
so whats your strategy?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:21:01
Liar 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:00:42
cause theyre manipulating the whole market
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:17
you really think that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:36:29
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:40
nobody knows except the big boys
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:54:41
Old joke
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:46:10
Every newcomer would’ve known that this is the easiest time to squeeze some shorts, since around 40% of the liquidity was missing - end of the story - no conspiracy, nothing special, just plain heavy market buys 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:48:46
Got banned yesterday for nothing. Opened supportticket...nothing
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:35
woooohooooo lets get ready to ramboooooo
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:06:34
anyone falls for this?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:52:08
Somehow I dont trust this kinds of broker sites which only talk about the fast and easy money...
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:02:17
Remind me!
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:19:07
We will stand strong against this pump &amp; dump!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:06
everthing overloaded
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:08:24
dont buy @ blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:39:52
Actually its about 0.9% atm
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:35:12
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:23:44
Coinbase &amp; Kraken are both really popular, but since Kraken had some serious issues the last few days at least, I would prefer coinbase. 
If you dont wanna have any security risks - offline wallet/hardware wallet  
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:12:12
But I‘m scaaaaared
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:16:11
Theyre not all the same, thats at least something I can say, many big exchange sites charge really high fees for that low amount of money.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:12:41
Just hold, pretty simple
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:07:22
Just do some research, you will find out
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:43
wtf are you talking about - which kind of drug is this?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:04
You will get them added to your coinbase wallet, which is online and owned by them, therefore the most risky way to store them. 
If you dont plan for going all in on bitcoin, a mobile wallet like bread does its job. Once installed you will have your own recieve adress, so you can transfer them easily from the site
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:30:28
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:05:59
17% in Euros ..
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:49:40
Sure Bitpanda is the way to go
