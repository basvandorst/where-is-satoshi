I don't trust sources that claim credibility  for their "predictions" by referencing hand selected past estimates that turned out to be true.

Is the AES-256 encryption in 7zip not sufficient with a long password?

No, it's free to make the wallet. Right now the Bitcoin network is overloaded, so it costs $4 to $10 per transaction (roughly) and it can take hours to confirm. If the gift receiver wants to transfer the Bitcoin out of the paper wallet to another wallet, that's another transaction fee. In comparison, LTC, VTC, or ETH cost much less per transaction and confirms in 10 mins.

You're going to be spending big $$ on transaction fees. Better to give LTC or VTC instead.

Laser is better than inkjet. However, I would be weary of printing at a print shop or at work because the commercial grade printers usually have hard drives that keep a cache of everything that's been printed.

Wiring money to Kraken isn't really a problem (although it took me ~2 weeks). The problem is their shitty exchange which is suffering from various API issues resulting in you not being able to place trades or accidentally buying/selling more than you are going for. Seriously, it's a huge issue and I would stay the fk away from Kraken if you can.

They say 5-12 business days. I'm on day 9 and waiting...

The price of the asset is determined by those buying &amp; selling. Holders do nothing except reduce the supply, but as long as there's a lack of demand and someone willing to sell, then the price continues to drop.

How exactly is Bitcoin improving technologically compared to a year ago?
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:51:23
Exactly. Also, even if people "intend" on investing into bitcoin, they are lazy and won't actually get around to reading up or understanding how the whole process works. So gradually, they'll just forget about it. I know I am guilty of that. I knew about crypto for a while, but didn't put in the effort to actually understand it until this year. I also know of people who have expressed interest in crypto but are perpetually in the "I haven't gotten around to reading up on it yet" phase.

Good for BTC in that less supply = higher demand? That might typically be true of markets, but of the "lost" BTC no one knows if it's actually lost or if the owner is just storing it long term.
