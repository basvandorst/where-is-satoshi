I don't know the original =(. Source?
(I also think we should do fewer posts like these. Give bch the btg treatment).

The best time to plant a tree is 5 years ago.
The second best time is now.

TenX is good (less fees than bitpay), but you'll be waitlisted since it's collapsed with orders right now. Expect it at the end of September.
Monaco will be available soon which is also good.

You asked how could one *estimate* that. You can see which coins haven't moved in 5 years, and you can try different percentage of how many of those are holders and you'll get a min-max range. You know that the max part of the estimate will be right, since all the coins that were lost 4+ years ago haven't moved, and the more time goes on the more accurate your estimate becomes, especially since people were much more prone to lose bitcoin back in the day than today.

It's just an abbreviation man, relax. People cal bitcoin btc or xbt all the time. Can't call bitcoin cash bcc so people are going with bcash or bch.

The NYA was meant to compromise between people wanting segwit and people wanting bigger blocks. Now, because the people who wanted bigger blocks have already gone their way (bch) and the out-of-chain scaling believers and "one-mb-blockers" already got the segwit that they wanted, there's no one here left to fight for the "bigger block" or "2x" part of the agreement. They already left, hence the hate for it.
I think NYA failed in that sense: compromise between these two parties. Yes their methods were kinda circumventing core and no I don't like that, but I like to think that they had good intentions for a better bitcoin future, whatever that meant in their minds. Never forget that we as bitcoin (yes I fucking said WE and I include both BTC and BCH) are fighting for what we believe is the best future of crypto. Competition is healthy, time will tell which method was the best. BTC and BCH may have different advantages and uses in the future and they may very well be able to co-exist, making indeed no method "the best", much like a screwdriver is no better than a hammer.
I, for one, hold both coins. I believe on a future where there's no hate between BTC and BCH. I believe that we can remember there's a reason why we're all in this crypto thing: we don't like banks or the government making stupid shit. To work against this we have to collaborate with each other, not create shitposts against "big blockers bch"  on and hate on "segwiters" on That is forgetting our purpose.
Why be enemies when we can be friends? I believe that.

Yup! Hello Me of the future!
Wonder how your life turned out! 
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:48:51
This can't happen. Even if you had all the btc ever created you just break even by destroying the new btc, no profits.

fees being pennies makes sense. Fractions is too low

As a guy who recently set up a node, I second that call. 4 nodes even? In VMs? 100% bs unless they have an amazing connection. Definitely not possible within 1SD of an average connection in the world. If someone proves me wrong I'll stream myself throwing my laptop out of the window.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:08:01
So... odd years?

I wonder what will happen to the sock market now
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:02:07
Well, they are most-populated country after all. I don't think we can solve that ever. Still we can even the scales a bit
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:36:07
Perfect, thanks so much

Runs Java!
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:11:43
It's 8mb blocks btw, not 2
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:31:54
As long as that's your *informed* opinion, then that's perfect. You're welcome to use what you want or what you believe in.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:23:39
Not wrong though. Limit *is* 8mb, and just wanted to instruct op so he could do his own research. I'm not about to explain everything that has already been said. Just giving him/her a starting point =).
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:18:07
Does anybody have a link on a tutorial to how to run a 15.0.1+ node?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:23:58
2x is 8mb max with Segwit. You can trust me on this one or do your own research. Maybe pm luke-jr
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:33:26
Exactly =)

I am curious about trezor and me being able to sell whatever coin I wanna sell safely =(

Argentinian here, we don't need to use this anymore since buying dollars in the bank is "allowed" again. I used to check 
 though =)
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:51:33
He literally just said it's because he's lazy, not stupid. You also don't know how many bitcoins he has nor how much %of his portfolio is in bitcoins/crypto.
Maybe in his case and with his knowledge is not worth it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:44:56
You're right and I'm wrong. How did I miscount *twice*? I swear I counted 16
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:00:16
Yay go bip91
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:26:08
but most miners signaling segwit are signaling nya and that was centralized was it not?
genuinely asking
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:27:52
That prediction is possible, but not the rest. Just trying to be reasonable here: The market cap should be in the quadrillions for that to happen. No way on earth that's going to happen in 5 years or even 10. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:49:54
I'm sure everyone understood what he said even if he used the wrong word. At least I did. You can't signal "NYA" after all.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:09:13
While you are technically correct, do you see this happening? Legit question
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:49:23
Do I need a special wallet after august 1st to make transfers now that this is a reality? I always had my ( few) coins in an exchange. I'm between exodus and jaxx but not sure if either of them will work... But I'm guessing both will?
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:57:31
Nope. If it doubles 10 times, bitcoin would be around 2.5 million/coin. If there's ~18 million coins that's 45,510,714,777,600 which is 45 quadrillion.
Mind you, maybe your interpretation is wrong: In the US/Canada system, a quadrillion is 10^15. Which is different from the British's 10^24
Still, even if my Math had been wrong, the gold market is around 10 trillions. Saying that bitcoin will double that by a huge margin in 5 years in crazy optimistic
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:39:36
there is no way that it's going to double 10 times. calling it now. Not even in 5 years
