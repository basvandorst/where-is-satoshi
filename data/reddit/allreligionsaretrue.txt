How yu doin?

Well, yeah, I readily admit it's not something I know much about.
So pat yourself on the back.
But I did bring something to light, even to the wise and wonderful person known as you. And if you read the article, it is a giant crack in blockchain. Unless you can explain how the article is wrong. 
Please explain how quantum computing is not a threat to blockchain.

I see. You think Bitcoin is going to hit 20,000.
It won't. It's over. Sell that shit now.

Whatever people say about BlockChain, keep in mind Google recently made a breakthrough in Quantum Computing rendering privacy moo point, as in, a cow's opinion.

Based on what you reported, I checked, and yes it says he is a contributor, but it's on the Forbes website. So how is it not from Forbes? Forbes published his work, even if he isn't an employee. So what?
Look, it's 2019 and Forbes posted an article by a contributor that, well, you can read all about it in the article.
Now OP wanted anonymity for 50 years. Do you think today's BlockChain will be impenetrable for 50 years if a giant crack has already appeared?
I'm not a BlockChain enthusiast, I don't even know if it's privacy that gets lost with this breakthrough, I just know *something* vital is about to be lost that's critical to blockchain.
Forget about the messenger, concentrate on the content of the message.
