40 years ago his PHD would have been in mathematics, crypto was pretty active back then as well.


This describes a lot of people not named Nakamoto though.  A long time ago I worked for the government and had a security clearance.  I'm now an anarcho-capitalist.  I've got a blank period in my employment history around the same time, as I was doing contract work.  I'm a programmer and my family would be unable to describe what it is I actually do or what I'm capable of.  They would also probably describe me as a bit of an asshole.  There are a lot of people like me out there, and the majority of us are not Satoshi Nakamoto :)

Well I'm not trying to win anything here, I'm actually interested in knowing how you concocted such an idea - specifically the American angle.  Any popularity Al Capone enjoyed in his time was bought, he went to great lengths to keep the locals happy.  Anybody celebrating him today is celebrating a fictitious character they've seen portrayed numerous times on the silver screen, they don't know anything about the man - their opinions are fueled by popular media.  And here is where my interest in your American angle is.  Did you develop your opinion based on popular media, nationalist propaganda, what?  Do you see the link yet?

We are all learning here, bitcoin is an extremely novel concept.  It would be easy to get frustrated with the lawyer and everybody else who has such a shortsighted view, but almost everybody is guilty of it.  For example, the present state of the exchanges.  Even the visionaries have taken this new concept and tried to jam it into the peg hole of old world financial systems, emulating them in almost every way.  Bitcoin has eliminated many of the things that informed the design decisions of yesteryear's financial systems (issues of counter party risk, settlement, etc), yet you still see people handing over their private keys...  Thankfully it is a decentralized system, so it only takes the example of one person getting it right in order to lead the way for everybody else.  No more begging, no more petitioning, no more groveling.

@_date: 2014-03-17 01:36:02


That is a symptom of the primary problem.  The primary problem being that your wealth is protected by a 16 digit number, an expiration date and your name.  This information is stored by every merchant you do business with and it doesn't change between transactions.  This would be like using the same password for everything, and everyone stores the password in plain text.  If anybody you've ever done business with leaks that info, you're exposed.  It is simply a very bad design.


Yes.  But you aren't exposed to that risk by simply performing a transaction, you are with credit cards.

So we are to presume that everybody is guilty of some crime?  Is that something you really want?


Don't be an ass, your original scenario made no mention of crime - you're now trying to muddy the water because of how untenable your position is on the matter of a victimless crime.


Nope, my original point is that there is no victim - take another look.


In economic matters one needs to assume rational actors.  It also isn't a matter of only price, look at convenience stores.


No they don't, they just need to file SARs.


True, without the overhead of reporting you could be more efficient and offer a better product to your customers.


You do know that none of the reporting is on the cryptocurrency side right?  It is only getting tracked by FINCEN once it hits fiat, so that isn't going to do what you think.  So now that I have clarified that point for you, who do you really think the victim being protected is?

There are plenty of ways to address the problem of speed, each having pros and cons.  A simple solution to the "realtime transaction" problem would be sending your key along with your order.  This could easily be managed in even a web browser.  Or you could have a third party clearinghouse that provides your key under specific parameters.

While the pie is cooling in the window, the neighborhood kid eats [67.4%]( of the pie - leaving you with only a small fraction of what you could have eaten.  Now you might argue that if the pie hadn't been so accessible, the neighborhood kid wouldn't have eaten so much.

Consider the role and functions of the banking industry.  Now consider the technological capabilities of bitcoin.  It should be pretty obvious what I'm getting at here.  The bitcoin protocol has automated away the inefficiently executed work that the banking industry performs.  Lets use Buffett's moronic check example.  Under the present financial system, when you write a check there are so many people and processes in that loop.  [You've got settlement and clearing, all that crap.](  Bitcoin has automated all that.  That is just one example.

It is a fact jack, everything the government accomplishes is through the threat of violence.






All those thing you mentioned cost money.  If bitcoin were to go mainstream, the government would lose control of monetary policy.  The state would be severely crippled.  It wouldn't happen all at once of course, it would be a gradual process until the state is a vestige - not unlike your tonsils.

It would be an appeal to authority though, by definition.  Your feeling on the matter, while interesting, is irrelevant to that fact.

Well those systems of auditors and licensees were designed to protect a currency that is highly dependent on trust.  Bitcoin doesn't have that weakness but due to lack of imagination - exchanges have been replicating the old trust based systems.  They have been doing so without the safety measures in place that the old systems have.  Instead of implementing those safety measures (which have a very high cost) I would suggest that exchanges implement a technical solution to the problem.  That would be difficult on the fiat side, but is certainly doable on the bitcoin side.

The community supporting bitcoin has grown pretty rapidly.  I've always wondered if statists just getting involved in bitcoin have really thought the whole bitcoin thing through.  As a Tea Party supporter, would it be fair to say that you believe the state is necessary (regardless of qualifiers like "necessary evil")?  If you believe the state is necessary, do you think it could exist without the ability to exercise a monetary policy or easily collect taxes?  If bitcoin were to go mainstream, that would happen.  So if bitcoin is a state killer, would you support bitcoin?

lol, it is an interesting idea, but it the exact opposite of simplification.  That uses namecoin, which is a complex and decentralized key-value store.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not out to shit all over other people's work.  I just don't agree with the method of execution (for friendlying up wallet addresses).  Look at the solution for PGP public keys.  This problem is the exact same thing that PGP public keys face, so it would be instructive to look to the solution for that problem: a mixture of key-value store and web of trust.  Actually, a far more simple solution would just be to just use PGP and stick your wallet address in the user attribute packet.  Boom, problem solved without an altchain.

Sorry, I don't understand what you're asking - rephrase?


Yes... I'm talking about cash.  Say you own a store that sells hammers.  You purchase the hammers from China and mark them up 30% for retail sales.  How are you going to purchase more hammers from your overseas supplier with a wad of greasy dollar bills?  You need to input them into the banking system.  Now the state is aware of the cash.  Now imagine the same scenario, but your customers pay you in bitcoin and your supplier accepts bitcoin.  How is the state going to know?  It doesn't even need to be an overseas supplier, I've never dealt with a supplier that accepts a big stack of cash.

Have you ever seen pending transactions on your bank statement?  Have you ever noticed how long they are in a pending status?  Have you ever experienced this from the supply side?  It would be a stretch to call the present system automated, and that is my point.


I get the feeling that you have a very shallow understanding of bitcoin, likely the same depth of knowledge about bitcoin that Buffet possesses.  You really should do some reading on [the internals](  Bitcoin can fully replace the functions of a bank, banks will be unnecessary.


See the above statement, you don't know what you're talking about.


Companies like Bitpay and Coinbase don't act as banks, they act as interfaces between the old system and the new.  If bitcoin goes mainstream then they will have no real purpose outside of offering suppliers shopping cart software.


I certainly am open to debate on the issue, and I'm not trying to shut the conversation down but there is not way to put this nicely: you don't know what you're talking about.  Do some reading on the scripting system that underpins bitcoin, we can fully automate the functions of the financial industry within one currency.

It isn't really the cost of the supply chain that keeps them honest, it is having to interface with the old financial system that keeps them honest.

That is not ironic.  You go to a doctor for his skill and training that enables him to make well reasoned decisions.  You don't go to him simply because he went to medical school and is therefor infallible in all things medical.


Yeah, a well reasoned argument - not "Trust me, I'm a doctor."


Ok, let me make your example relevant to what got us started down the rabbit hole.  As a coroner, I notice that the refrigerator is without mustard in the house of every smallpox victim I collect.  I've developed a hypothesis and documented the thousands of cases.  I discuss this with the medical board at the local hospital, they dismiss my evidence and argument without giving it any consideration - their "knowledge and experience" inform their decision.

That would be a massive change in the way things are presently done, you have to know that.  They would not be able to create money out of thin air any longer - they would actually need a balanced budget.


Because of the anonymous properties of the currency.  The USG uses the banking network as a surveillance system, this isn't hyperbole - this is a well documented fact.  Bitcoin cuts the banks out of the loop, the state has their eyes plucked out.  You cannot manage what you cannot measure.  The same thing goes on with speed limits.  People ignore laws that they disagree with unless they feel the risk isn't worth the reward.  They'll also have a very hard time seizing bitcoins, compared to regular old fiat.

Obviously I disagree, it is my position that the state would be unable to function as it presently does.  The first reason is that they would not be able to control supply, this is a very big deal.  Second, they will have an extremely hard time collecting tax - because the incentive structure for individuals to pay would be way out of balance vs the likelihood of punishment.

@_date: 2014-03-01 03:52:22


So that is looking at it from the exchange's perspective.  From the customer's perspective the biggest problem was when they suddenly couldn't withdraw bitcoins.  Of course you should focus on ensuring that you don't ever get to that point as an exchange, but what about a system that makes it impossible to lose or steal customer's bitcoins?  That is a technical capability of bitcoin, multiple signatures.  You could work that into the settlement part of the order process.  It would be a lot of work on your part, but it would protect both you and your customers from a lot of potential problems.  The transparency stuff is great and should be done simply because the cost of implementation isn't that high, but it wouldn't be much more than a canary in the coal mine.
Anyway, thanks for answering the questions - good luck to you guys!

Consider the American revolution, they didn't just get their way - the whole world changed.  Now I'm not saying that we're going to all migrate to some lawless floating city, we'll just conduct more and more of our business in bitcoin.  This will, over time, reduce the power of the state's monetary policy.  That is just one alternative scenario, where we don't play by their rules and we still win.  Your way might work, and you may think that it is the best way, but don't pretend that it is the only way.

Cryptography, yes, most definitely.  Crypto is extremely specialized.  If I had to guess just by looking at his work history, I'd say his area is in signal processing.  As far a data structures, there would be nothing close to the complexity of the blockchain in that sort of work.
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:15:53
Oh sure, there are a lot of ways to do this.  It is a little frustrating that after all the exchange failures people continue to follow the same general model.
So in the traditional market, when a broker executes a buy he doesn't immediately pay - he can't because fiat doesn't work that way.  So they use [clearing houses]( for settlement.  We don't need clearing houses, but we do need some sort of settlement process if multisig is in use.  So lets walk through it:
* I deposit btc at a multisig address, I have one key and the exchange has the second.  The exchange sees the balance and that money can't move unless we both turn our keys.
* I sell by btc.  That needs to be settled, so I provide my key and the exchange takes full control of the btc - they assign the USD to my account.
Under such a system nobody can steal the btc unless they have both keys.  The worst thing that could happen is the exchange loses their key and nobody can access the btc at that point.  There are ways around that though, like a trusted third party key holder.

No, it is not immediate.  There is counter party risk and that is figured into the price, the suppliers don't get the money for quite a while.  This is a big problem in a global economy with a patchwork of regulation and varying levels of law enforcement effectiveness.  It would be difficult to overstate the value of a system that eliminates this counter party risk and allows unhindered global commerce.  There is so much inefficiency in the present system that it would be difficult to cover all of it in this thread.

OK, it appears we want to talk about two entirely different things.  I'm talking about the communication of an idea between two or more individuals - as was described in the original topic of discussion.  As the OP has described things, there was a contest of ideas that basically didn't go anywhere because the finance guy pulls the old appeal to authority card.  You seem to be more interested in diagnosing the finance guy's personal issues of rejecting information without examination.  My position on that: he has a personal problem, but the moment he tries to throw around his weight as a finance guy - that is the fallacious appeal to authority.  One can reject information all they want, but when they try to communicate an idea they can't just say "I'm an expert on this, no data necessary!"  If they are actually an expert on the matter, it isn't difficult to provide a reasonable argument.
For example: my coworker (who isn't a programmer) tells me that I should implement algorithm X, because it is the most efficient at sorting a specific data structure.  I don't just say "No it isn't, trust me - I'm a programmer."  I say "No it isn't, and here is why..."

Maybe you are a better investor than I am, can you believe that I've acted as if investment involved a level of uncertainty and risk?!

Economic freedom is very important in a stateless society, but just as important is the flow of information.  Mass communication was available in young America, but controlled primarily by those who could afford a printing press and the means of distribution.  Of course, that is no longer the case.

The solution to the problem is better engineering and more money spent on more robust systems.

What other cryptocurrency?  One of the many bitcoin forks that would likely suffer from the same vulnerability?  I think we need to nail down what period of time we are talking about - now, a year from now, five years from now?  I'm going to assume we're talking about now.  With all that people have invested in bitcoin, I think it is very unlikely that they'll be flying to litecoin or PPcoin due to a DDos or deep packet filter.  Of course, when I say invested, I mean time - all the coding and integration work.


If we are talking about right now, most people can certainly afford to not access their btc during a DDos or deep packet filtering.  If we are talking about at some point in the future where bitcoin is mainstream then I agree - that is something we need to work on before it happens.


I'd like to hear why you think they've waited for so long to spring their attack.


That hasn't been true for bittorrent.  No deep packet inspection there, even with heavy lobbying from the entertainment industry.


Yes, but it is a very bad idea to ignore the past.  Do you seriously think the USG will turn around their long history of failed bans, and that victory will be over something as intangible as bitcoin?


Capitol controls? Sure.  But why would they go after the bitcoin network?  You know they have the world's financial system on lock down right?  They could just go after the exchanges, easy money.  The banking trouble that exchanges have been going through has been industrial pressure, I don't think we have yet seen serious USG pressure.

They would have a hell of a time trying to convince their suppliers to use this single centralized money blackhole.  I'm sure it will be attempted anyway, let the market decide.


Regulation.  The barrier to entry is way too high, so the only potential players are companies like Paypal.  It will happen, but when it does you can expect to see some serious rent-seeking going on.  It is going to be a very entertaining show, because as adoption increases - all the regulatory capture will be for nothing.

Well income tax in the US started in 1913, in 1935 the USG went after a guy for tax evasion using his bank deposit information (Gleckman v. United States).  So bank surveillance of individuals started then in the US.  Before income tax, the USG got its revenue from import tariffs - imports being pretty easy to monitor.  Modern banks have been around for almost a thousand years, but they were primarily used by institution (like governments and trade companies) - not individuals.


Because all you need for a libertarian society is economic freedom?  No, there is a little bit more to it than that.


Actually, early US was pretty libertarian - the most libertarian, before or after.  Things really went south during the civil war, and never really recovered due to the explosion in federal government power.


I do, for a lot of reasons - many of which I've listed a little higher up in the thread, you must have overlooked them.

I don't know why you would be insulted, because what you want, a state, cannot effectively collect taxes from bitcoin users without serious molestation of the blockchain.  It is therefor logical to assume that you would advocate modifications allowing for such tax collection.  You cannot have both a state and mainstream adoption of bitcoin (as it is today), insisting that you can have both while ignoring the facts is illogical.
Also, I'm not suggesting that the state will hire programmers to make the necessary modifications to the standard bitcoind... leave that to the statists within the community.  I'll tell you how it would happen:  apologists for the state will make arguments from a utilitarian perspective.  They will argue that the bitcoin community should pursue avenues that lead to greater adoption, regardless of principle (because in the end we just want to get this mainstream amirite).  One of these avenues is appeasing the state, so they will push for additional functionality in bitcoind to allow for "merchant options" - like always using the same public key and other terrible things.  These will only be options though, not forced upon the users.  That alone wouldn't be a big deal, but it would only be the start of the degradation.  That is why statists make for poor stewards, lack of foresight.


Yes, and as I've said: they can't tax what they can't monitor.  I know you think that a massive state agency could audit everybody and still catch tax evasion (and such a fictitious body could), but it won't happen because it would be massively expensive and unpopular.  Before you try and compare the unpopularity of the Iraq war... your neighbor's son dieing in a foreign land doesn't have the same impact as a government stooge searching your home.


Private key, public key or both?  Nothing is stopping them or course.  But you need to take into consideration this hypothetical scenario of mass bitcoin adoption.  In that scenario, their monitoring methods in the banking sector are completely useless (that is the only method they have for catching tax evasion, beside massive and continues audits).  So how are they going to monitor the blockchain?  They will use a similar system to the old, tax ids and KYC regulation for the merchants.  This will be strengthened by additional regulation, similar to PCI compliance.  This is not pie in the sky speculation, this is how the present system works.  Now, you can't read this last paragraph and deny that bitcoin would be adversely affected by all that.  Destruction to anonymity and zero barrier to entry.


And how do they collect tax on cash transactions?  By monitoring the interface to the banking sector.  If you were to go down to your local bank and deposit $10,000 in cash, Fincen would immediately be notified and you are exposed to investigation.  If you regularly deposited smaller amounts, they may be notified (at the bank's discretion).  Cash is not anonymous.  Sure you can avoid using banks, but then you are limited to who you can do business with (sending cash in the mail is a bad idea, also records are kept on mailing activity).  The comparison that people keep drawing to cash is quite ridiculous, bitcoin isn't even close to being the same thing and the government knows it.  That is why the state will try to apply KYC and MTL to merchants, because the banks are out of the loop at that point and they need to maintain visibility.

In absence of taxing alternative that would survive an anonymous transaction network, it is only logical to assume that there are none.  I was really hoping you could suggest some.  I can only think of two: property tax and some form of life tax, which would break the progressive taxation schemes of today.


I think most people believe that they're being logical, while most aren't.  I've debated a lot of statists, but you are the first one I've found to insist that they are being logical - instead of fleeing to the worn out appeals to emotion (think about the children).  So that is pretty weird, and denies me the satisfaction of resting easy in my impenetrable tower of logic... nah, I still think you're being illogical :)  I disagree with you on the issue of ultimate truth.  One of us is wrong, one of us holds political beliefs where a universality is not universally applied (leading to major flaws, like murder being alright as long as the king says so).  But we probably won't agree on the answer to that in this thread.


Ha, my first reported tagging.  I tagged you as "asshole" but changed it to "statist" about midway through this thread, so you're moving up :)  Also, I don't know why you wouldn't consider yourself a statist - as you have been arguing for the state.  I understand it might have a negative connotation, but I say it in the most sterile sense.
As this is my first reported tagging, I'll give you a bit of bio so you know where I'm coming from.  I'm a software engineer / security researcher.  I spend all day, every day, thinking about system design.  So when I think about economics and politics, I think about efficiency and scalability.  I try and avoid the issues of morality, because systems are amoral.  But I do focus on foundational issues, like the fact that all states are based on the premise of "might makes right", which is ridiculous of course.


Yes!  Life would be better for everybody.  Poverty in the US was on the [decline]( prior the [Great Society]( government meddling.  All those programs stopped the decline and fixed the poverty rate, which makes perfect sense - as the USG has a strong incentive to keep people poor.  Without government distortions, the free market rewards efficiency.  A lot of people fear such efficiency, pointing to the inevitability of robots replacing a bulk of the work force, but these people overlook the fact that price reductions come with such increases in efficiency.  For example: look at the cost of electronics before and after the advent of [pick and place machines]( [wave soldering]( [etc](  This is what really gets me about statist: in a statist future, you get more of the same mediocrity... but if we were to unlock the free market - humanity would evolve at such a rapid pace it is hard to comprehend!  Let me stop you before you suggest that a free market can exist along side a state, it cannot - not in the long term.  States expand, and there will always be the threat of state caused market distortions.  So yes, the poor will be taken care of - because things cost less and altruism (which wouldn't magically disappear in Ancapistan) would be less burdensome.  The sick and disabled would have access to the finest medical technology not yet invented at amazingly low prices (compare the quote on medical procedures for cash vs insurance).

In a word, yes.  More specifically, I'm referring to unethical or obviously ridiculous laws.  Ethical laws, against things such as murder or other property damage, are pretty much common sense.  That is why juries are preferable to a panel of judges, because it allows for jury nullification (this is what caused Colorado to legalize marijuana, prosecutors couldn't get convictions).


That isn't true.  People drive at a speed that they feel is safe: [New York DOT Study](  TLDR: People ignore bullshit speed limits and travel closer to engineer recommended limits.


That will not work out well for them, it would simply hasten citizen dissatisfaction with the state - which is part of the secret libertarian plan for global domina... liberation.  If bitcoin were to reach main stream adoption, can you imagine how invasive and expensive an endeavor it would be for the government to do this?  It would be an impossible task.  As I said, tax collection is really the least of the state's concerns in that event.  Clearly stated: the state cannot survive bitcoin, you can only choose one or the other.  I'm not saying that this will happen overnight, it will be a gradual process - but it is the inevitable conclusion.  The best thing the USG can do, to further its own interests (which rarely align with the interest of the citizens), is apply AML at the interface to the traditional financial system.  This is only a delaying measure though, because as the bitcoin economy grows - fewer transactions will be touching that interface.


[I'm an engineer of sorts](


OK, I feel bad for not making this more clear - as it might have saved you the trouble of typing the rest of your post out.  I think bitcoin is one of the last pieces needed to unlock a stateless society.  This is a perfect example of [Emergence]( the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The interaction between the components (economic freedom, self ownership, mass communication, etc) is where the magic happens.


That is a great point, and why I would recommend starting another sub - because the community is not monolithic.  I know you're not happy about libertarians taking the current sub name, but that is really a non-issue.

No, I didn't - because it is a silly argument.  But lets take a swing anyway, first lets properly frame your argument: people steal music and movies more now than in the past due to technology somehow corrupting their moral principles.
For you to defend this argument, you'd have to demonstrate that people in the past didn't record radio broadcasts, sneak into theaters, share mix tapes, etc at a higher rate than people pirate entertainment now.  I don't think you can do that.  Further, in order to address the issue of technology corrupting morals - you'd have to demonstrate that people in the past would not have pirated material if given the opportunity.  I don't think you can do that either.
As soon as you can provide this evidence, we can address the argument.  There you go...

No, this is why you have backups.  This is not a problem unique to bitcoin, you can be sure that your bank has several offsite backups.  Also, why would a hacker password protect your wallet and demand a ransom?  If they can do that, they might as well just read the private keys and take your money.


You are over thinking it, just export the public key private key pair and save that in a safe place.  This way you do not need to worry about software versions and vendors - everybody can deal with that format.

I'll admit that I'm no expert on the history of Holland, but a read through of the [wiki entry]( shows the original construction of flood control measures was the responsibility of private land owners - not government.  Now, because I don't know enough about Holland, or its long political history, I'll use an exaggerated hypothetical situation to prove my point.  Say I live on the coast of Louisiana and I want to expand my acreage of arable land, but my only possible direction of expansion is into the Gulf of Mexico.  Would it make sense for me to demand that the government build a dyke system, at the expense of everybody else?  Would it make sense for me to build the system myself and then demand the government maintain it when I find the expense too great?  Would it make sense that whoever I sell my newly drained land to has an expectation of government assistance?  The answer to all those questions is no.  The same can be said for road construction in the middle of nowhere.  Here in the US, specifically the midwest, there are small country roads all over the place - usually constructed my county governments using state and federal tax assistance.  Does it make sense that some low income urbanite living in Dallas should subsidize the construction of a country road used primarily my wealthy rural land owners?  No, if you want to live in the middle of nowhere, you should bear the expense.


So, to be clear, you do believe that the end justifies the means?  If that is the case, I don't think we are going to find much to agree upon.  There are better ways to pool resources to accomplish difficult projects in a voluntary manner.


I suppose I should be more clear about why I think statist would make for poor stewards of bitcoin.  Consider all the amazing innovations of bitcoin: transactional security, transactional speed, anonymity, systemic integrity, low barrier of entry, etc.  Statists would mangle several of the innovations immediately: anonymity and low barrier of entry.  You can't have anonymity if taxes are to be collect, and the barrier of entry goes up due to regulatory requirements (millions of dollars to meet all the money transmitter registration requirements).  Statists just shrug and say "Well, gotta pay for the dykes."  While libertarians resist the molestation.

Bitcoin has a much higher velocity than the USD - so don't worry about the flow.  Also, if nobody "hoarded" bitcoin then we'd still be below a dollar in value and that would make it impossible to reach the long term goal of global adoption.

Just using your own argument...
The point is this: the internet hasn't turned women into exhibitionists - it simply made the behavior physically safer.  If you consider that bad, well then you'll just have to take the bad with the good.  Same deal with bitcoin.  If people are willing to do something that you consider degrading for compensation, then bitcoin is going to make that easier.  But internet/bitcoin isn't changing people's ethics, it is simply make things easier.

It certainly did not.  There were aspects of it that changed but the underlying principles always remained the same.  It is very likely that bitcoin will experience the same thing, portions of the protocol falling into disuse - while new things are bolted on.


And you are being obtuse.  Why are you trying to compare bitcoin to a physical thing like NiCd batteries?  You can't update the operating principles of batteries in the same way you can modify software source code.  It would make more sense to compare it to something on the third layer of the OSI model.

I would be surprised if the National Reconnaissance Agency participated in such an overt and domestic endeavor.  It would most likely be a joint operation between every other three letter agency that would only temporarily disrupt the network.  They would have to know this, and I seriously doubt they are too keen on looking impotent on the world stage.  I'm not saying that they wouldn't want to, I just saying that they couldn't and they know it.  Would this be enough to kill the baby in the crib?  Maybe, but time is running out for them.  Once bitcoin gets integrated into Wallstreet, they are too late.

Now it is "It doesn't matter because the new users won't care about politics, so lets not talk about politics!"
It is tiresome, and that will make people short with one another.

You have proposed that *regulating* the mining capability of individuals (through technical means or some other way) may have a positive effect to the mass of the public.  I suggest that, like the vast majority of regulatory laws, this will have a net negative effect.  This is completely different from something like the maximum number of bitcoins in existence, which is systemically regulated.  What you are asking for would be technologically impossible.  So the only way to do what you're asking would be regulation by means other than technical.

Then publish your results.  I'll just wait here and hold my breath.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:02:27
I'm sorry, I don't think I'm understanding you.
The present system of transaction fees does not control the supply, it simply shifts ownership (from the sender to the miner).  If you were going to use transaction fees to control supply, you would need to destroy a portion of the fee.  The portion of the fee destroyed would be based on the average number of bitcoins (or whatever) transacted within a fixed period.  Is this what you are suggesting?

Nope, my first point covers that.  Either the technology is simplified to the point where anybody can use it, or people in general have to understand merkle chains and all the complexities that are bitcoin.  If the technology is simplified, it doesn't matter what we call it so long as it is memorable.  This simplification is being worked on by a lot of people, so changing the name would be ridiculous.
The theory that you have put forward is that the name is causing confusion that will somehow keep people from understanding what bitcoin is or how it works.  First of all, a person that stupid would have no hope of grasping the finer details of the protocol.  So no harm done.  Second, attempting to teach the population of the Earth enough about bitcoin to make use of it in its present state is impossible.
So the only correct course of action is to simplify the user's experience and not mess about with things that don't matter.

The link is to a summary of the study, which I certainly wouldn't recommend reading :)  I thought it was common knowledge that artificially low speed limits led to noncompliance, but that is a US perspective.


I can't think of a circumstance that justifies taking somebody's property through force or the threat of force.  This really boils down to a simple question: **do you think the end justifies the means**?  I do not, and I'm surprised that anybody does.  But statists will quickly argue that by not paying taxes, you are stealing governmental services... services that you don't want and didn't ask for.


As I have pointed out, bitcoin circumvents the systems that states use to monitor money movement.


Anarcho-capitalism is the logical conclusion of libertarianism.  Libertarianism is a stepping stone that we have a chance of seeing in this lifetime, anarcho-capitalism unfortunately is a long way off in my opinion.  I've already addressed the remainder of that question, though maybe not to your satisfaction.  Bitcoin users would benefit from an education in ethics and economics, my preferred flavor of the two are addressed in the easily accessible libertarianism.  Smarter users make for a stronger system.  A perfect example would be the issue of exchanges and AML.  What would be better for bitcoin: a system that is unaffected by governmental / institutional banking pressures, or one integrated with the old system?  Political ideology is going to strongly affect a user's choice in the matter.  Libertarians make for better stewards of bitcoin and its long term success, while statists and utilitarians would easily lead bitcoin down a less prosperous road.  Again, I'm not arguing for political purity - I just think that if you're interested in bitcoin's long term success than the application of libertarian principles is the way to go.


Yes, I think you've got it wrong on that one.  To put it broadly, I don't think anybody should be forced to do anything (that includes mods).  If people are upset with the direction of than they should start another sub (and have), that makes for a stronger community.

So how about you stop telling people how they should promote bitcoin?  You have missed the point entirely.


Everything is politics.  Libertarian politics have been used as a tool to promote bitcoin, and vice-versa.  This has worked pretty well so far.  Now, this has obviously upset you.  So I suggest you work on your own message and get to work on displacing the libertarian one.  That will be a great deal more productive than telling libertarians what to do.  Demonstrate the superiority of your method.

First of all, I'd like to state that I respect what you are doing - just not what you are trying to do.  I think when you have a grievance, petitioning is the first logical step.  But this issue has been brought up several times in the past with no change, so petition is not really a logical action.  The next step would be direct action.  Since you cannot force the mods to do anything (which is a wonderful thing when you think about the history of force), you must choose from alternative methods:
* Leave (I'm not suggesting that, included for completeness)
* Compete


How did you find this sub?  I'm willing to bet that you did not manually type in the URL.  More likely than not you performed a search (inside or outside of reddit) and followed a link.  The name of the sub would have nothing to do with your exposure in that case.  What influenced your direction to this sub, through a search, was the activity and indirectly the size of the community.
There is nothing preventing anybody from creating an apolitical bitcoin sub and generating quality OC.  Let the market decide.  If the sidebar politics is so upsetting and such a turn off, than it should be easy to accomplish right?  I imagine that would be the only thing that will move the mods, a mass exodus of subscribers to your new apolitical sub.  Why are the mods so obstinate on the sidebar issue?  I think that, like me, they believe that the bedrock of the bitcoin community is libertarian.  Denying that would be an insult to those of us to have put time and energy into bitcoin for the purpose of not getting rich, but changing the system.
You may argue that if I'm so confident in bitcoin's ability to affect systemic change, why not disassociate it from politics and allow said change to occur?  Here is why: I am concerned about well meaning individuals bringing statist bad habits into the bitcoin ecosystem and fucking everything up.  Now I'm not arguing for some kind of political purity, I welcome everybody to the party.  But I think that bitcoin will fare much better if people have an understanding of where it came from.  If people understand Austrian economics and the principles of libertarianism, then they don't think stupid things like "A fixed monetary supply would disincentivize investment, so bitcoin is bad." Or "Bitcoin facilitates money laundering, who will build the roads? Bitcoin is bad."

I'd like to know what you mean by "dumbs it down".  Dumbing it down and fucking the system are not mutually exclusive, so I'm having a hard time guessing at what you're talking about.  I'll provide an example of dumbing something down to the point of damaging it though:
The year is 1989, most people don't understand email (especially women for whatever reason).  In an effort to dumb it down for the slow folks, the US Government mandates that every email address must be associated with a real identity on a public registrar.  This would make it so grandma doesn't have to understand MUAs, MSAs, MTAs or MX records.  This kills the email.  There have been several equally stupid suggestions for bitcoin, tainted coins for example.  Is this the dumbing down that you are talking about?

Importing a private key requires no transaction fee because it does not touch the network.  The only time a fee would be realized in the process is if MtGox were to move the balance after import of the private key and voluntarily pay a fee.  They could move the balance to a hot wallet or cold storage, either would prevent the user from performing a double spend.
I think I may have muddied the water by mentioning my past deposit.  It was a regular deposit, not a private key import.  I brought it up because in that case MtGox paid no transaction fee on the eventual transfer of balance (either to cold storage or another user).
The more I think about it, the less likely it seems to me that they would wait on a cold storage batch job to update your balance after a private key import.  I will have to test this at some point.

I disagree.  When China clamps down people seek an alternative means of communication, short disruption will have little impact on the user base, long disruptions will shrink the user base.  I think bitcoin would follow the same pattern.  I'm sure that it would have a very negative impact on the trade value, but that doesn't kill bitcoin.  I'm sure that bitcoin's user base would shrink if the government began monkeying around with the network, but that doesn't kill bitcoin.


Some people.  While I would be sad to see the purely profit driven folks leave, I don't believe it would be "forever".  Forever is a very long time and people should use the word sparingly.

They have to first know that I "owe" them anything.  The comparison to cash is silly as well.  People don't perform large cash transaction because of the risk involved, AML regulation, physical distance - weaknesses bitcoin does not have.  The banking system is used by the state to monitor the movement of money, again, bitcoin plucks out their eyes as banks would be largely bypassed.  Why would a merchant voluntarily collect and transmit sales tax to the state when the state has no way of knowing that the transaction occurred?  The only way the state would be able to keep tax collection up would be to increase invasive monitoring/auditing, monitoring that it would not be able to conceal.  This would further alienate the citizenry as well as drive compliance costs up, further weakening the state.

I don't want to come off as aggressive, but that is very very wrong.  You need to consider the motivations behind the systems we're talking about.  People lend money to banks for two reasons:
* Banks have systems in place to make transactions safer and easier.
* Banks provide interest on the deposit (loan), this is important because of deflation.
Bitcoin solves both problems (lets assume that an idiotproof wallet comes out at some point), so why would people need traditional banks?
Now, banks can adapt to this coming change - but their present incentives aren't going to be enough.

I am pretty sure you've already heard the argument :)
Would you agree that bitcoin, as it is, would function well in a stateless society?  I'm going to assume you agree with that.  So explain to me how it would function, unmolested, in any other system as the primary currency.  Barring any silly mistakes on the user's part, you cannot confiscate bitcoin, you cannot track it, you cannot freeze it, you cannot inflate it, you cannot restrict it.  Bitcoin would seriously weaken the state's economic grip, so called soft power diplomacy and tax collection capabilities.  Bitcoin is not vulnerable to force, and force is the only tool the state has.  Bitcoin is incompatible with the state.  This is why the anarchists have taken the lead on bitcoin (as you have recognized), and not the statists.
I am very interested to hear how you think it would work in any non-voluntarist system.

This is not accurate.  Introducing or reducing computing power does not influence the rate of bitcoin production.

Adding additional computing power causes the system to increase hashing difficulty, bringing the average mining rate back within the 10 minute average.

Again, I'm not an expert and don't have the time to become one on the topic of Holland history, but did they really create a government to govern the construction of dykes?  Or did a government assume that responsibility?  In any case, I stand by the statement that there are better ways of managing projects that are too large for one individual.  Insurance would work.


Well there are some very fundamental problems with the philosophy.  Relativism is a broken philosophy, for example: was slavery always wrong?  Who decides what community rights trump individual right?  A majority of the individuals?  In that case you have the problem of majority tyranny.  A panel of "experts"?  I'm sure you can see all the problems that would bring.


I can explain that: I don't believe that you've thought the problem through - that explains the logical inconsistency.  How can the state collect tax if anonymity is in place?  I'm going to guess that your answer is only to remove the anonymity of the merchants... so they must register a public key with the government.  Well, you've just killed the anonymity with that as the government can collect sales records from the merchant and match transactions to buyers.  That would also weaken the block chain, as [reusing addresses weakens cryptographic security](

Well, incentive might not be the right word... it would make paying taxes on bitcoin less disgusting.

But if I were allowed to deduct loss from capitol gains, that would make it less shitty.

Lol, it appears he and I share similar ideals - not surprising.  As I said before, bitcoin's future is intertwined with that of a reformed system.  Bitcoin is political.

Again, those people haven't thought things through.  How are you going to limit the state's expansion of power?  If you are interested in the morality of the problem, the only answer is a stateless society - as a state cannot exist without a geographical monopoly on violence.  The "statist bad habits" I was thinking of include the habit of not considering the scalability and morality of a system, short sightedness is the norm among the average statist.  Another bad habit, maybe the worst, is a belief (unconscious or otherwise) that the end justifies the means.

LOL, my sides!  Yes, let us petition the Whitehouse on their website!
If there is one lesson you should take away from bitcoin, it is that you don't ask the state politely - you just fucking fix the problem.
After receiving [IanCormac's]( generous tip, I feel it my duty to further expound on my point.
*steps on soap box*
The only time the state would care about your feelings is if it believed you were a legitimate threat to its designs.  This requires capability.  Let me relieve you of the notion that your vote is a threat.  Millions of votes have already been bought with money stolen from future generations.  That is on top of the fact that the system has been structured in such a way that voting only offers the illusion of choice.  Those bought votes really only influence which fat kid is momentarily king of the hill.
I listened to an amusing [radio segment]( today on the Diane Rehm show, the topic was "Democracy In Trouble".  After an hour of back and forth among the statist panelists, unsurprisingly their solution to the current public disillusion was that both parties need to work together to get the legislative machine rolling again.  No systemic reform, according to the experts the public demands more of the same!
So what are we to do, if not petition, canvas and vote?  Disrupt, that is the only thing we can do.  Disrupt until the system collapses upon itself.  Now I'm not suggesting some Mad Max scenario involving assless chaps and mohawks, a more likely scenario is abandonment of economically unsustainable policies following financial collapse.  The US government is the slowest moving corporation in existence, they are vulnerable to disruptive technology.  [Bruce Schneier]( has written extensively about how technological improvements always favor the aggressor.  We agents of change are the aggressors, throwing boulders into the tank tracks.  We are the [star wars program]( that will bankrupt the USG.  Every PGP encrypted email you send will have to be routed to their [Utah data center]( where countless electrons will be slayed in an attempt to reveal your top ten cat video picks.  Every bitcoin transaction will deny them a cut of their "protection" money.
Don't ask the state to stop devaluing its fiat currency, promote a currency that is invulnerable to such manipulation.
Don't ask the state to respect your privacy, encrypt your communications and obfuscate your activities.

I'd like to know your source on that.  The majority of bitcoin holders with enough capital to make a killing are early adopters.

First of all, and please take this in the most clinical sense possible, it doesn't sound like you've got much of an emergency cash reserve built up.  So keep the old advice about not investing what you can't afford to lose in mind.  Considering that, look at the past performance of btc, the only time you would have lost money on an investment is if you bought in around 2013-04-07... every other point in time would lead to a profit today.

Yes, but of course those governments were not anywhere close to modern governments in scope or expense.  We only need to look at modern day Detroit to see what happens when people [stop voluntarily paying property tax](  No, all their problems cannot be blamed on loss of property tax - but that is the major source of revenue for cities.


**Belief**: conviction of the truth of some statement or the reality of some being or phenomenon especially when based on examination of evidence.
**Faith**: firm belief in something for which there is no proof.
I believe that if bitcoin were to go mainstream, governments would struggle to collect taxes and would, over time, become irrelevant.  I have laid out a logical explanation for said belief and effectively defended it.  But what I'm getting from you sounds a lot more like faith, with your response to my logical argument being "Well that is the way it has always been, so it will always be."

The distinction is between faith and belief.  It may be helpful to define terms:
Faith: a belief held in absence of evidence.
Belief: a feeling of trust based on an examination of evidence.
It would be illogical to say "I have faith that the sun will rise in the east", but a statement of belief would be logical.  The same can be said of bitcoin.

That was a good article.  The VAT is a better alternative to sales tax, because it incentivizes compliance.  Unfortunately it still suffers a [weakness]( that puts it at the mercy of ill-designing men, who could more safely commit their fraud in the world of mainstream bitcoin.  Also, the proposal for guaranteed income fails the test of basic economics.  Generally the way such a proposal works is in the form of a [negative income tax](  Of course, since now you cannot monitor the movement of funds for tax evasion, you cannot ensure that people aren't cheating the system and fraudulently collecting tax rebates.  So you are left with [basic income]( an unconditional income.  The problem with a basic income is that it seriously warps the market, we only need to look to the US higher education system:
* the government guarantees student loans at a certain level
* universities increase the cost of education, knowing that students can pay the increase due to government loans
* the government increases loan level, due to increased cost of education
* universities increase cost... etc
So all you are left with is the VAT, which disproportionally taxes the poor...

A webcam captures your face, which removes anonymity.  The mass adoption of facial recognition technology is right around the corner and I think most people are aware of this.  This doesn't stop exhibitionists, because ease of use trumps anonymity.  You'd be more anonymous by relieving your identity to one artist than the whole of the internet.  Ease of use is much more important than anonymity.  All technology, including bitcoin, reduces the amount of labor required in order to accomplish something (pouring steel, moving great distances, showing 1 million people your genitals).  So you can easily replace any instance of "bitcoin" with "technology".  Your question would then be "Has technology made people less moral?"  The answer would be no, technology just makes it easier for people to do what they've always wanted to do.

And yet people still don't bother protecting their face because they value ease over anonymity.  As technology becomes more and more advanced, we lose more privacy.  You might cover your face, but the dead pixels on the CCD act as a fingerprint for your camera - any family photos you take will link back.  You might recompress the image to conceal the dead pixels, but some other method will be discovered.  Technology makes the task easier and easier.  We are transitioning into a reputation based system.  Trust will always be necessary, but through technology we are able to more precisely assign trust.  Where you see bitcoin eroding morality, I see it ushering in a strong reputation based system that will bolster morality.

'Plenty' as in the readership of all the financial magazines running stories on bitcoin for the last several months.


I assume you're referring to the mainstream adoption holdup.
* It isn't lack of understanding of bitcoin on the layman's part (which is what your attempt at a rebrand is trying to fix).  Plenty of people float through life not understanding how the technology they use works.  Example: computers in general.  Presently, you cannot safely use bitcoin unless you have a full understanding of bitcoin.
* Volatility.  The more people we have involved, with competing interests, the more stable the price will be.  But with a 21 million limit the present price is way too low, so we will continue to experience severe volatility until total saturation.  Until that happens, businesses will be uncomfortable holding bitcoin - and will utilize exchanges... which are bitcoin's primary weakness - which when exploited causes additional volatility.
In summation, bitcoin has a lot of potential problems going forward - but none of them have anything to do with the name.

Invest your time in education.  I'm not talking about the shit they pour down your throat in public school, I'm talking about a marketable skill.  When I was your age I was interested in computers.  I'd spend quite a bit of time in the local library.  I remember printing off an AT&amp;T assembly code reference manual, making several trips as to not piss off the librarian.  I'd then hack away at the family 386.  I have forgotten most of what I learned about assembly, but what I learned about programming stuck.  That was a good investment of my time, far better than playing with pogs or whatever else the teenagers were doing at the time.
Time is a finite resource, it sounds like you figured out that you were squandering yours on a lot of the schemes surrounding bitcoin.

Neither of those methods require you to publicly expose yourself, as the goal is not to draw media attention, the goal is to cause the machine to break down under its own weight.

That is all you need to know, the whole republican vs democrat thing is silly because they are just shades of statism.
As you said, bitcoin is a tool, but it is a finely crafted one.  The obvious intent of its design is to make obsolete the former system that props up states.  Sure you could use a spanner wrench to hammer in nails, but that doesn't change the true purpose of the tool.  I think we'll be seeing that in the future of bitcoin, people tying to constrain its utility with regulation.

Well this doesn't work any better than drug laws, or really any laws that people ignore for various reasons.


This is not true.  Sure you may find the occasional case of somebody informing on an ex-spouse, but the USG isn't sending IRS agents around to inspect your property for brand new cars and boats.  That may come up while they're investigating you for something else, but they'd have no idea you've got a new boat unless they randomly harass citizens... or spy on their banking activity.  This is what I was talking about earlier, they can't spy on you unless you use their banking system.
Inability to collect tax isn't the only problem the state faces in a bitcoin economy.  As I said before, they loose the ability to inflate the economy with fake money.  This is a tremendous loss for the state, far worse than not being able to easily collect taxes.  They also lose the ability to wage economic warfare.  The present situation with Iranian trade sanctions, for example, would be impossible.
