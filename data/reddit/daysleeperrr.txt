He is talking about transactions which don't use lighting/segwit, and yes, without a blocksize increase those on-chain transaction costs will continue to rise (they already have since most 1MB blocks have been full). However Segwit offers an alternative way to make transactions so not all transactions have to be on-chain. Some people (read to see their side of the story) believe that Segwit has security risks and moves away from Satoshi's original idea of all transactions on-chain. Basically, he is talking about a high toll on the side road, while the newly created highway is amost free to use (but he doesn't want to use that because he doesn't think they highway is safe).

Great, I've added your link. Don't feel obliged, but if you would like to link back to my site to support the initiative that would be great ;-).

 As I just started on it today, there are only a few posts right now :-).

In my opinion there are two options, not really a middle ground. Option one: Bitcoin becomes one of the main payment methods on the internet. In that case, the demand for Bitcoin would be far far far higher that 21M*900$. Option two, somehow, Bitcoin doesn't make it. Can be due to a hack of the hashing algorithm, goverment repression or simply because a better alternative arrises. In that case, it will finally go to near zero. 
I don't know which option is the most likely, I'd guess at 50/50 now. As the profit in the first case is much higher than the loss in the second case, I'd take that bet.

Inventive kid! I really like his entrepreneurial spirit so I featured his link on the site ;-). Maby you could ask him if he would want to link back to usebitcoins.net to support the iniatiative!

Thanks for the suggestion. Your website doesn't mention the acceptance of Bitcoin. As my initiative is mainly aimed at increasing the credibility and recognition of bitcoin, I would ask you to mention Bitcoin on your site. As soon as you've done that let me know!

Thanks for this suggestion. I'm a bit in doubt as your webshop has some quite outspoken political views... don't know if it will be good for bitcoin (which is already associated with buying weapons) to add your site. But feel free to convince me ;-). Ill have a second look tomorrow! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:57:30
I'd love that, thanks for the suggestion! Maby the moderators can discuss this proposal?
