 The Constitution was made for plain citizens to be able to interpret the law. The meaning and intent of post ex-facto laws is explainable to a 10 year-old.  The lawyers say you need a specialized degree. 
The IRS announced they made a law (fk u btw for saying the irs is offering me 'guidance' lol)  - This law was made where there was none before. 
AND that 'violators' of this new law,would be subject to penalties.
AND that the Penalties would extend to before there was a law?!!!  
BTW, I/We don't need to convince the justices. The people are Justice, eventually, always. 
Good luck tracking everyones bitcoins. Fucking laughable law. the people with enough btc to be worried about his will move it offshore through 5 blenders. 
IRS = lose.

Now I have a reason to gift bitcoin.. I know a ton of Zynga game addicts ;)

IF they had specified mining in any way, I MIGHT take that as a short answer. But they were quite blunt and callous with the piece.  Really no worse than I see them butcher any other technical subject they cover however..

I was just looking at rugs on overstock.com last night, nice selection. Wife is still deciding, but we will be paying with btc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:58:19
I stand corrected. Sorry.

To do this would take 6 months minimum in paperwork, You need a bank license and clearinghouse/money exchange license. 
Takes about 1.5 million for those two.. And paperwork. So much paperwork. 
And at the end of the day: US will say NO FKIN WAY. 
Anyways, btc-e is nice exchange, check it out.

The 7-11 story is very interesting. Some of the roots go back to Americas first 'convenience stores'. They overextended in the 90's and got bought/bailed out by their largest franchise group: Japan.  
Convenience stores are part of the culture of Japan. They are as common as starbucks here. They don't have room for giant shopping malls everywhere and many people bike/walk, so distance is a factor.   
Explains Vending machines.

I will be expecting MERCHANTS to split the savings with me or better. If it costs them less to deal with bitcoin, I should get my product cheaper.

Of all the things to do in CO, Denver is not on my list.

THIS is what will make BTC roar.
Discounts = win. (listen up Tiger Direct and overstock).
If they save 4% CC fees, gimme at least some of it! -That's incentive!  (Otherwise, I'll continue to hoard my coins, kk thx).

Been using Apple products since the IIe. But so much BTC in my life that it's foolish for me to not have an android..

Let me sum this up: The banks robbed us. They took the money and said FUCK YOU and YOUR KIDs and your Retirement plans. 
Then Holder, you know, the guy who lied to congress under oath, our nations TOP legal guy supposedly, fast and furious fuckin Holder.. Basically helped them cover it up. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:16:53
Hmm. Want to call BS because why would you expose $15k as short term and get potential 40% taxed? As a TEST?!
Explain pls?    Also, begs the question, if they accept gains, are they going to let me report losses?
 
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:36:20
Silly me, I was just gonna trade it in.. They started offering btc for them today even, lol.   Apple, who used to be for techies, is now slapping them in the a$$. 
Lets see how that works for em.
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:52:54
Fair, reasonable, flexible even. Overall, the fact that Singapore is clarifying its position is good. Where will relevant companies migrate to and ostensibly pay taxes to?  Always where the climate is most favorable. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:17:12
Insanity. Classic taxation without benefits AND the IRS just announces **they have manufactured a post-ex facto law?** !!!!
Ex post facto laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3.
It's also called TREASON when done deliberately and with thought. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:16:41
Another lawyer telling me the plain truth of something? That I have somehow overlooked?  How naive I was to think I could understand the law which was written directly for me: the average citizen!
Thank goodness we have the lawyers.. 
Thanks for the offer of taxation without anything in return, and an onerous, CURRENTLY IMPOSSIBLE system of tracking floating values I'm now required to follow, along with the threat of persecution for past offences before any law was established. 
Nice try. But again, fuck you and your shill. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:19:06
The REAL bitcoin vulnerability?
YOUR SYSTEMS security are SHITE. The deep state has seen to that. 
YOU HAVE NO SYSTEM SECURITY. PERIOD. No guarantees with backdoors fellas. Argue that. 
Why aren't 'they' fighting btc anymore? Because they fucking own it any time they want. 
Oh those 'tinfoil hats' were right (again)?
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:01:03
They tried to steal my bitcoin. 
Held order. 
Held order. 
Held order. 
THEN THEY cancel order and offer no refund. 
5 weeks later I get a refund.  
Only cost me about 4 hours of my life on a phone. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:16:53
lol. Holder here, but still don't pretend this isn't the same scenario as cash and the elites. People with money bought btc. And because they have money, they dont need to sell it when it dips.
10% hold about 90%. or worse.. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:49:01
Keep saying the infrastructure is sound while discounting how compromised security really is. 
Someone argue our devices are 'safe' at this point. 
 ANYONE?!  
-I'm supposed to trust any significant amount of wealth to that? 
Not to mention, the bTc wealth landscape is as bad as any capitalistic fuck scheme I've ever seen.

Snowden is a CIA controlled asset. The CIA and the NSA are more adversarial than you would think.
Proof: we have what % of his 'revelations' -how many years later?  And how much of what was released new information?

Watch how fast exchanges drop a shit coin. Especially after they lose $$.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:00:20
LOL. NO they don't. 
they just pay a premium to SAY they use clean energy. 
Truth: there's a limited amount of power on the grid. The grid buys whatever's cheapest and you get the power. 
Does anyone think they have the ability to route different power sources to different facilities?
Clean power surcharges just go to to a collective fund.  And NO, they don't even spend all that on renewable. 
Sounds scammy?
Yeah. the power industry is all kinds of fucked up.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:42:33
yeah, Boston here.   
Even supporting a BTC business is against the 'rules'.
I was opening a data center with low cost elec, garnered alot of interest.. When they saw I included supporting BTC miners as part of my business plan, they shut my account down without even a phone call. Had to find out from my vendors.  They were real assholes about it too. Just said it was their right to not do business with anyone, at anytime. 
Beverly bank, MA. &lt;--bunch of fuckers. 
Oh yeah, losta fuck ton of coin too when FEDs shut down e-btc.. a foreign exchange they have no jurisdiction over. Took my money with no appeal process. 
Fucking police state looks 'normal' until you run into it a few times: this gov't is fucked. 
9/11 was neocons and Israel btw.  (Banned from conspiracy and pol for mentioning this FACT: FOIA PROVES FACTUAL)!&gt;

Is that in your lawyers handbook? Because all lawyers are just sooo busy with caseloads they can't possibly work for less? This case has merit. It's not a simple fraud case and any savvy lawyer who gets an early in on bitcoin litigation could quickly find themselves the expert in the field.   Don't be foolish: Call several lawyers. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:33:24
Are they accusing you of committing a crime? If they are not, then a crime has been committed and you are subject to protection.  You are a victim of fraud. Start calling lawyers. Bring your account into dispute. Make them litigate with you if you have to. (just owe them money for awhile).

The Blockchain, your wallet and his wallet are the key pieces of evidence. They show a legitimate two person transaction, operated under no duress, with a transmission and receivership of goods at an agreed upon price. The transaction is verifiable and immune to alteration after the fact- the block chain is your evidence.    The banks misunderstanding of facts is no excuse to confiscate money from you, indeed it is just the opposite: presented with an allegation they do not understand, they simply seize your assets? Sue. Sue. Sue. Sue bank treble damages and lawyer fees. Sue person individually for personal and wire fraud. 
Get a savvy lawyer, they can make a name for themselves with a case like this: precedent likely. 
Localbitcoins.com has a high chance of getting a subpoena over this, they can verify IP.

You never wrote down wallet passphrase? That multi word mumbo jumbo? If you have that you can just load a new wallet and enter passphrase, your coin will sync to your new wallet.

That is between bank and person crying fraud and not a third party that suffered as a result. Banks have insurance for this.

My last legal costs were $500 upfront. I settled with $15k in my pocket. Lawyer cost is not a particular I even care about.  Did it take a few calls to find the right lawyer? Yes.  Am I happy I did it? Yes.

@_date: 2013-12-09 15:11:49
Not blockchain for that. IP for that: show two diff locations for transaction. Now, if it's a crime, it's a conspiracy and wire fraud. Im just saying, all this information can prove ALOT, indisputably.

Mt.Gox apparently has begun following some banking regulations like requiring paperwork for &gt;$20k withdrawals. But they are paying out and you can do business with them, Feds are letting them conduct business obviously.
They aren't the only exchange in town either if that bothers you. Quite a few are out of the reach of the US feds. 
Anyways, I keep thinking why go back to cash from bitcoins? I can spend it on amazon now, etc. Back to cash is just an unnecessary fee, unless you're speculating BitCoin price is gonna plummet (Doubt it).
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:29:45
Let me do the math, like a good BTC citizen.. Airfare, food, time, and a paltry $350 at the door?   Of course you take bitcoin! In a bear market, for a future event!  I'm sure all your speakers will share ALL their secrets, so of course it's worth it, right?!.
Serious? Dragon con is like $75. You guys are NO DRAGONCON!! lol. 
At your pricepoint, there is nothing I can learn from you.
Try About $50 in person (you better beg people to come too, and make it worth it) -AND sell video streaming tickets @ $20 range. 
If I had Bitcoin conference in Boston, about 100 people would show up.. And I know half of them..  You sure your market is ready for this? Or are you trying to profiteer?
