how long would it take to crack 10 character password?
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:28:22
Can you clarify --- 
So, all they would need is the wallet password? or phrase? how did they "unlock" the wallet then?

What's the latest on regulations/legality around ATM's like this? 
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:19:29
the password was ONLY using in TV. it would have had to have been HACKED somehow. Also log me in was active but I had not used it in months. Still doesn't explain how the got the 10 char pass.

The transaction looks the same as all of the other people who got stolen from in this attack. TX was broadcast using blockchain.info's own systems.
Can you clarify what attack youre talking about?

For what it's worth... a couple days ago someone logged into my BTC-E account using this IP address: 94.242.246.24 shouldve been a decent red flag, but i hadn't logged in there forever and figured the site was shit

i did not use tor.
i did have remote desktop via teamviewer installed. i am happy to publish the logs if anyone can make sense of them.
i am not sure how someone could get access to my Gmail via teamviewer, where there may have been the wallet backup. I dont think there was any wallet backup on my PC but I am checking.
What should i do??

Searching the suspicious IP address turns up a TOR server. The user of the server with a non-spam email address on that day 
Turns up " 11/24/2014 14:59	94.242.246.24	bletkorer	nghfgdfd "

Not sure. 
I think it mostly had to do with my email being compromised, + keylogger and then blockchain.info stupidly sending email backups of my wallet back in 2013 by default, me not realizing the security hole this created. They have accepted no responsibility at this time despite raising $31 million in recent funding. I highly recommend AGAINST using blockchain.info or any uninsured 3rd party wallet service. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:18:21
Are you kidding me??? If this is true... this is what happened...
I don't see how else they got access to the password...

As the victim of the latest 64 btc blockchain hack, I am glad mine and other recent cases have led to an increase in security interest. I hope this benefits bitcoin in the future. 
I would love to find a way to recoup coins through donations or otherwise, while helping with my newfound cause of bitcoin security. I am considering starting a podcast, YouTube channel, or other ideas to move this cause forward. If you are interested in collaborating, please PM me.

so is there any chance of a hard fork based on this?
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:44:34
I dont know shit about segwit
Can someone explain if this means BTC has a chance of forking to Unlimited?
If no, why is the value of BTU increasing / holding steady on Bitfinex after this news?
