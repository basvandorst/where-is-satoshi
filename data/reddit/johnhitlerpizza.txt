I'm saying the technology and the regulations needed to effectively use the currency on a large scale aren't there yet. Maybe when Lightning gets successfully implemented it will change. Right now it just has very little to do with individuals and more so with game theory, you can't ask people to take risks out of principal.

The market is extremely volatile, that doesn't inspire trust. Imagine you buy a pizza with bitcoin and the next day bitcoin goes up 30 percent, you'd probably kick yourself in the head for that. So then why not trade your coins, diversify your portfolio and stimulate the market? There are fees you incur when you trade and there's also a lot of risk. Most people who have significant amounts keep it stored on ledgers. When you want to trade you have to transfer it to a trading website, if you do this you have to start worrying about hackers, ddos attacks during price spikes and all other kinds of nonsense. Holding on is the most logical thing to do unless you know exactly what you're doing or if you have a lot of money and you're not risk averse. It's simply the wild west out there.

I hope it goes way down and then stays there till 2021. That way you can have a televised dinner party together with McCafee.

It's just a very quirky romantic comedy about a homosexual relationship between two men, one imaginary and one real.
