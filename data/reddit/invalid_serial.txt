Heh reminds me of the fact that one of the dutch drug information groups [unity]( has some really cool [patient information leaflets (like legal drugs do)] ( these are in Dutch only tho :-(

Sounds like they were just the normal high dose (220mg) dutch ones and he took too much (normal dose is half a pill) so he effectively did 6x normal dose...

i think you mean dee-dos on that last one, as otherwise you'd get a dddos attack.
but yeah, mount gox &amp; dee-dos or dee-dee-oh-ess are acceptable, ...

Simpeler, newer less well known algorithm makes it more vulnerable (but also faster and a lot easier to mine with cpus and gpus) 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:34:11
sooo was that the big bitcoin bubble the media was talking about ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:16:36

i'm still waiting on a withdrawal from the end of march (30th i think) :(

for me i've been using em since they were €4 , but i must admit i regret it seeing how much they'd be worth now. and am currently holding the few i still have weither they ot to 2000 or to 0.
however my dad also started buying them as an investment, he is however computer illiterate, and entrusted me to manage his (and my advice was simple, when the cypress shit hit the fan i advised him to buy asap as it was a sure thing they'd go to $100usd or +€75, so we bough in at €55.40 and sold at €75.60 , withdrawing all but his profits.
but now he sees all the media attention the current rise and the max keiser shit (oh yea it'd deffonately become 200 000 or a million &gt;_&gt;) he wants back in (if possible under €100/btc) thinking it'll just keep going up &amp; cant fall,...
but this time i cant make any promises, and would advise against risking the amount he wants to buy back in for.
dont get me wrong i'm a big btc fan &amp; supporter :)
