This makes me uncomfortable. Why roll your your crypto? That's how disasters happen. 
* Once you have a single share to work with in SSSS, bruteforcing the other one becomes much easier, is it more or less easy than bruteforcing a 128bit key? I don't know. It doesn't seem worth the risk to me.
* The password "scrambling" xor would be a lot more effective if you didn't use such a fast hashing algorithm. Try scrypt with a large cost factor rather than SHA512.

Security is your deal, a host won't do it for you. A $3000 job on elance won't cut it. You will be compromised in minutes and lose all of your funds. Then what?

Debit cards can still be charged back.

Fucks sake. How are you taking this thread as a "go ahead". You clearly have absolutely no concept of security in a very security tight world.

Easy. Accepting with a credit card is a huge risk. You're paying for the huge risk.

You already gave me one part. All I need to do is find the other and see if it matches your destination address, which you also supplied. 


If I have 2 parts of a needed 3, there's a vastly smaller attack space than if I have 1 of 3. 
Please just use Armory with M of N backups and hide them in non-obvious places. At least that won't end in the uncertainty of you permanently losing your funds.

Oh god. Please don't create an exchange.

Make your own subreddit then. If you can't understand the subreddit without memes, then you don't deserve to be here.

So implausible to have never happened. Use search next time, this gets asked once a day and the answer is always the same.
