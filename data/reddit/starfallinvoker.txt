Assuming they have 25% network dominance, the expected number of blocks in 4 minutes is about 0.1. This event is poissPdf(0.1)[4,infinity) = 4 in a million improbable.

High orphan rate would disadvantage smaller pools
In a small pool, you might have 90% of the network working against you, in a big pool maybe 75%. In a small pool your block is hence 20% likelier to be orphaned.

P2Pool stands strong against centralisation. However, this comes at the cost of extreme mining share difficulty (several hundred thousand), crowding out small miners and counteracting some of the decentralisation. In the end it is a very complex tradeoff.

Yes, it is perfectly possible, and they could even get 100% of blocks if they wanted. However, such a collusion will be short-lived as after some time the big pool will probably get more reward if they start attacking the 20% pool as well...

Not exactly - the birthday theorem only says that if you generate ~2^128 keys there is a 1/2 chance of collision within those 2^128 keys (and not for any of the other, say, 2^40 keys that have already been generated). Even so you need 2^128 memory to store those keys.

Why are you deciding to create your currency? If it is just to make money, I advise you to think carefully about it.
Nevertheless, the steps:
1. Decide on what cryptocurrency yours will be based on. Read the code carefully.
2. Modify relevant parameters such as block generation time, reward, reward decrease/growth, PoS parameters, difficulty adjustment, premine and hashing algorithm. If you don't understand any of these, go and learn about them.
3. (optional, but is definitely recommended) Implement distinguishing features. Implementation is left to the OP.
4.  (optional) Decide on a motive for your cryptocurrency - this should help it gain wider adoption. (Though if your aim is to make money, Cryptsy seems to be listing most of the non-scam and non-premined alts nowdays.)
5. (optional) Release.

Found [this]( Basically, you can brute-force a session secret letter-by-letter (correct and incorrect guesses have different delays). It is a side-channel attack, which relies on some of the imperfections of a real-world system (that is, timing can leak information about what is happening behind the scenes)
The mechanism is similar to the [Tenex password cracking]( where instead of measuring the timing, one observes whether a page-fault occurs.

When a trader sees your offer and accepts it, they will be provided with an address to fund the transaction with. Once the transaction goes through, he can release the bitcoins to you. If it does not go through, the BTC is refunded (minus tx fees). After bitcoins are released to you, you can withdraw them to your wallet.
For bank deposits, whether you want to use that method depends on whether you trust the seller. Does he/she have a good history? Try depositing a small amount at a time so that you don't lose too much at once if he/she decides to run.

Think of your wallet as literally a wallet.
For example, you have a $2 note (which someone gave you) in pocket  of your wallet. To spend $0.25, you can turn the $2 into two "notes" of $0.25 and $1.74 (with $0.01 tx fee), where you give away $0.25 and place $1.74 back into your wallet in pocket  but you don't have to dump all the other notes (totalling $7571.42) out of your wallet to pay this $0.25, and same goes for the SatoshiDice transactions. Of course, you could do that and get a $7573.16 note back, and you could even split it into smaller notes all in the same transaction, but we don't do that since it's quite ridiculous to use.

The program to track it is commonly referred to as a "wallet". When setting up a wallet, they give you an address to deposit coins into it - you can tell to withdraw your $0.50 into it. I use the program Electrum to store my funds, but others use things like Blockchain.info and Coinbase.
Signing up - no, you do not need to sign up. :)

You can't tell me to invest/buy into altcoins just because they have outperformed bitcoin on an XXX timescale. It has to have tangible benefits compared to Bitcoin.
Some benefits that have been marketed:
* Faster confirmations: Might be useful for real-life transactions, however merchants can accept properly-sent zero-conf transactions, or rely on a properly-managed offchain service.
* ASIC-resistant: which is easier to get, an ASIC farm or a GPU/CPU farm? Is a government more likely to have a large number of ASICs or a large number of supercomputers?
* proof-of-stake: Yes, that makes securing the network less costly. But that's not why I'm investing in it, am I?

The miner would periodically scan the blockchain. I think the following would help it deduce whether it is participating in an attack:
* After a new block is confirmed over the block currently being mined by the miner, work is not updated (the miner is not given a new block to mine) for more than 30 seconds. 30 seconds should be more than sufficient for blocks to be verified by all nodes.
* The prevhash (block the miner is mining upon) is not in the chain for more than 30 seconds.
* The block the miner is working upon is 2 or more blocks deep in the chain.
The first and third criteria help detect a double-spend attack, the second helps detect one of the cases of the so-called "selfish mining" attack (and also buggy pool software)

The variance of a bet describes how much the results of a bet vary. A high percentage bet has high variance because the results vary widely (you could win/lose a little, but there is a small chance that you could lose/win a large amount), while a middle-percentage bet has less variance. Also, a large bet has much more variance than a small bet.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is with this that we can determine how far the performance varies from the expected norm. With the standard deviation, we could determine if the site result (expected 39.3K, actual 484) is the result of statistical fluke. In this case, it might or might not be the result of one or two gamblers who got quite lucky with large bets.

I don't agree with the usage of the word "premine" in this thread. Is CGB (bitcointalk's favourite alt-coin) a premine? MEC? Because each of these coins' reward decrease are almost as fast as QRK's. I think we should call it "unfair distribution", since "premine" already has a more accepted meaning, that being the mining of coins before release.
The thing I disagree is that they are trying to pump the coin. I believe that coins should be left to stand the test of time on their own. (Then again, this is a free market, so do whatever you want)

52.2MB -&gt; 52,200 KB -&gt; with an extremely generous transaction fee of 1 mBTC/kb, is 52.2 BTC

Are you sure it's a binary string of 9 digits? Try this:
     perl
    for((1&lt;&lt;8) .. (1&lt;&lt;9-1) ){  the exponent for different search range
        my $m=sprintf("%b",$_);
        continue if( (`bitcoind walletpassphrase happyday$m 10`) =~ /-14/ );
        print("happyday$m
");
    }
Note: I do not have perl on my system right now, so I can't test this.

List of recent whales:
* eleet, who made a spectacular series of martingales at 33% and for some reason blew it in three massive 49.5%s.
* ffs, who won a huge amount with a starting bankroll of 150, but lost 1K recently
* mechs, who was +5200 at a point but lost
* nakowa, who is still +10,000 or so
@_date: 2013-09-23 16:28:01
Edit: It's back to +2.9K... I can't wrap my head around such huge amounts. The amount nakowa just lost is near half a percent of the total number of bitcoins in existence right now...

Nice. I hope Bitcoin gets more widespread attention in this region. Straits Times just ran an article on the Bitcoin ATM, so that should draw more attention.

I heard that some BFL models have long latency times when processing work, leading to many stales. I could be mistaken, though.

The fee to spam a block to 1MB is (0.0001 BTC/KB)*(1024KB) = 0.1024 BTC. Since there are 52560 blocks a year you would be looking at 5382.144 BTC of fees. And then the blockchain would be only 52.56 GB, not multiple TB.

A switch to GetBlockTemplate with blockchain-aware miners should stop this problem.
Of course, there aren't exactly many people that currently can scan 2^64 hashes in the time it takes to mine a block (or a year, for that matter), so for now most pools will stick to Stratum.
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:32:04
Ah... looks like I didn't read the specification properly. My bad...
So the way this would work is that you set an nLockTime transaction with a sequence number of 0. If the site is still surviving, before the nLockTime expires you set a replacement transaction, invalidating the locked transaction. Otherwise, the nLockTime transaction fires?

Stratum gives the miner work to hash. The work has two 32-bit blank spaces (in the most common work format). Together they give a 2^64 search space. The miner only needs to get new work if a new block occurs or all 2^64 hashes have been tested.
Since the pool would like to need to provide as little work as possible, this is a good method, however if you have a fast miner (say 1 million TH/s) you would have to get work once a second, which is undesirable. In that case you would switch to GetBlockTemplate, which allows the miners to create their own blocks to mine (of course the reward still goes to the pool). In that case the pool almost never needs to provide new work, except when a new block is found.
