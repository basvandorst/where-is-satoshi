First of all if you want to do this understand that you need to use fix API to have any chance of it functioning reliably which means GDAX. Secondly there is no flash crash protection because if there is a flash crash the API (particularly any REST API) is going to crap the bed and your sell order is not going to get through. 
Other than that hop on the developer forums for any of the exchanges and start going through the API documentation.

I dont even think it will be a fork... All the major mining pools will collude to agree given the right conditions. Mining is capital intensive and while the large miner groups make decent profits right now that will start to change down the road. If they really get kicked out of China and have to go somewhere and pay electric rates that are unsubsidized this will knock profits down. Then in 2.5 years the block reward halves again to 6.5 btc.
So now these guys have the ability to agree on a code change that allows them to keep the reward constant; not increasing the supply by a huge amount but enough to keep themselves incentivised but they sell it as offsetting attrition.

The idea is basically 1 of 2 things:  1) you have a few channels (lets say 5) you open with various people or companies. you can transact with them or you can transact through them with yet other people and this can have many hops. When you transact through people you pay them a small fee but also people can transact through you using your channels and then you get a fee. every channel is a tx on the blockchain and ideally they can stay open indefinitely but in practice this will not always be the case. or 2) you open one channel into the LN to a hub and that hub is big and connects to other hubs and people. they manage all the connecting for you so its easier for you and you only pay for one tx on the blockchain but you pay more in fees.
either way its at least 1tx on the blockchain to get into LN if you use a central hub but then you basically recreated banks/debit system (and eventually chase will just buy the hub youre doing business with anyway so were back to banking)
The whole point is everyone opens (and maintains) multiple channels so it never gets centralized to the point of hubs but now because of the limited tx throughput there's no way you are getting 100M or even 10M people on LN much less the 7 Billion people that really need a system like this.

Everyone seems to forget if enough miners agree they can change the code to allow for more bitcoins to be mined (and this will happen when the profit motive becomes large enough)

2-5% is basically what banks/credit card processors/paypal charge as a fee to handle moving money. So basically thats what i would want to get for putting my extra money in the LN (although i only want that return annually not per tx)
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:27:19
it is absolutely cool and even *cooler* when you take a minute to think of all the clever ways malicious actors will attempt to exploit it. For instance what do you do when someone gets ahold of your previous contracts and broadcasts them to the chain to make it look like *you were the one attempting fraud* and then posting the most recent contract and taking your funds as a result. So we say "well we are just going to have to be responsible to not let anyone have access to our previous channel states". Except that we are already talking about trusting a 3rd party to hold those contracts and broadcast them as our proxy in the event we are offline. Also why having a 3rd party proxy that we have to trust part of this... The whole point of LN was that it was supposed to be  *trustless*
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:06:32
Dont get me wrong i really like the idea of LN in terms of what it could be. The real problem is i guess nobody is asking the question "What problem does LN solve for *me*? what is it going to do better for me that my bank/credit/debit doesnt already do?"
Fast payments for almost no fees? i already have that. I can and do pay all sorts of people all over the world. I pay *no* fees and the bank handles my counterparty risk and also fraud prevention and i get miles on top of it. It just doesnt make sense.
Also this isnt my requirement, this comes from the LN developers themselves in the whitepaper. They literally spell out transactions for 7 Billion people. Thats the intent; to make this available for everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:33:21
There is always a way to commit fraud if the cost to resolve the fraud exceeds the amount recovered. With this system that will be the tx cost of settling to the blockchain will determine this (analogous to my legal costs to sue the guy that bounced a check to me)
If we really are talking about mass adoption here (that is the whole point of bitcoin: everyone can use it) then there needs to be a way for the poor guy in africa making $25/week to A) get on LN and fund his several channels without paying $10 each channel and B) be able to resolve disputes without paying $20 each time
Also im not sure how safe everyone feels about the fact that the guys that run the software that validate the disputes are mostly in China and can simply agree to arbitrarily change how it works if it suits them (it doesnt right now but that can change).
Dont get me wrong. Im a huge bitcoin believer (from the beginning) and i think something like LN is the future but you dont have to be a genius to see this whole thing is a disaster and as one of the few people who for a long time was *actually using bitcoin as a currency* It bothers me to see how unusable it has become
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:45:05
hey im not saying its reasonable, just that there have been certain cases where inflationary currencies have benefited countries. we dont have to like a thing to admit that it helped us economically. Its all about opportunity cost: The only reason we have gotten to the point where we have something like bitcoin is because of all the innovations that led up to this (internet, cryptography, tor, etc) all offshoots of govt funded projects that we have benefited from. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:52:10
A good counterpoint to this is in terms of fraud resolution: Im a business owner and we do alot of webstore sales and as a result deal with credit/debit card fraud and to be honest we lose a non trivial amount of money because the current system favors the consumer.
LN however does not. It places the burden of fraud on the consumer: if someone hacks your node/wallet and uses it to buy something from my business and then sends it to some random address we aren't going to be responsible. SO from a vendor perspective we *dont* pay the 1-3% tx fee and we also *dont* have to eat the cost of fraud. Its kind of a win for us.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:22:41
taxes will be *higher* with a deflationary currency... keep in mind inflationary currency is not bad if the money printing causes an increase in efficiency: think of the massive govt spending that created the interstate highway system which in turn revolutionized commerce/distribution. The US could never have paid for that on a gold reserve currency but by printing money it was able to and the payoff was huge.
where fiat becomes a problem is when the govt prints money and it *doesnt* increase efficiency.

yes this is the the part of the economic discussion where it gets really fun... So there's fiat printing in response to inflation and then there is QE which is the hot topic: the idea is the govt (ideally temporarily) inflates the money supply with the idea that the induced inflation causes economic growth/innovation/improvement in efficiency which then creates new wealth (sometimes massively)
So i am a big believer in bitcoin but i see things from all sides and one of the things we forget is that most of these crazy disruptive technologies including all the pieces leading up to the creation of bitcoin pretty much came about as a result of massive govt spending on projects paid for by fiat induced inflation.
The truth is we are right in the middle of a huge ~100 year experiment: is fiat better/worse overall compared to a backed currency and we honestly dont know the answer long term.

@_date: 2018-01-23 18:35:36
The route doesnt matter. remember the whole premise of LN is that money gets forwarded through you by means of you having at least 2 channels. you give up some ownership of funds in one of your channels but gain ownership of the same amount of funds in another channel (plus a bit more for fees).
So from an attacker perspective they dont care what channel owners the funds hop through as long as they do hop and he ends up with funds in his channel (which he then closes and absconds with)
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:55:14
You still have to get 7 Billion people on LN though... If anything we can expect fees to go *up* (and thats even with Segwit and its maximum 6x improvement)

Thats actually a great point and i am typically all for that but look what has happened. the market has decided that bitcoin is not a currency at all but rather a speculative asset.

Inflation doesnt go away regardless of what currency type is used. Whether we are using bitcoin or fiat doesnt change the fact that sometimes a resource will be in short supply and that will drive inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:47:40
correct. except now by transacting with one big hub and one channel we are basically back to basically having a debit card with a bank. Then tomorrow you wake up and find out Chase actually bought the mega hub you use and you go "wait, what was the point of all of this??"
The more i look at LN it seems like a Segway: The cool solution to a problem that nobody has, or if you do have the problem you cant use it. The average person in this subreddit is pretty happy with their use of banking/credit/debit card system and the protections that come with it. The people who would greatly benefit from LN are the poor people in Africa or India with no access to proper banking but how do they even hope to open/fund channels when their average income is $30/week?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:27:51
It can but why let market forces decide things when you can collude. Look at semiconductor manufacturing which is an insanely cutthroat business; any of those guys could simply wait for market forces to push some of their competitors out of business and then absorb the remaining profits... but that doesnt stop them from colluding to price fix every 10 years or so. (memory chips, anyone)

Theres no delusion. Unlike most people in this subreddit Ive actually *used* bitcoin to buy stuff. Ive been excited abou this stuff waaaayyy longer than most people. And Ive had to deal with all the problems that come with it e.g. lost keys, wallet problems, shady exchanges. Its been 2 years and were just now getting LN working in a closed test config.
Meanwhile i use my credit/debit cards for *everything* with no fees and when they do get compromised my bank takes care of everything and i pay nothing. This is just the reality.

True. the lightning network allows any amount of time but the examples that are always given are 10 days or 30 days and the reason is to put a limit on the time you wait to get your funds back if the channel partner is uncooperative.
I guess it would be better to say the vast majority of peoples practical use of LN would be monthly settled

because dead cats that's why.  In any market you have to separate the underlying value proposition of an investment and the market psychology.
Everyone talks in polar opposites about how bitcoin is either the future or its a crazy speculative bubble. The truth is that it can be both, and it is...
So yes bitcoin has a future but its not what alot of peopl think and its not what alot of people have been sold and also its value vs fiat is likely to go down for a while as people realize that the promised utility is a ways off.
In the meantime theres still room for 1-2 more "bounces" where the last few bagHODLers (see what i did there) try to jump in and alleviate FOMO.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:32:19
you can do better than that...
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:57:24
A LN channel is just an abstraction of an address on the blockchain: So think of it this way... You have your wallet which corresponds to an address on the blockchain where your bitcoins actually exist. Your wallet holds the private key to allow coins to move from that address into another address. When you and a channel partner open a channel you are actually just sending funds from your address and his address to a 3rd address. But this address is a multi-sig address which has 2 new private keys; one for you and one for him and *both* are required to move any money from that address.
All the transactions that occur on LN between you and your partner are really signed tx's that send some percentage of the contents of that address back to you and your partners individual addresses. 
So when you are on the LN you can keep you LN channel private key in a cold wallet but then that mean each time you wish to make a tx you have to sign a tx from that wallet which may be fine for some people. but if you want to route payments or if you want to use LN in the way it was intended where you can route payments through other nodes then private keys are going to need to be available to the LN software.
So what is the security risk: well the *only* person who can steal your funds in that particular channel is your channel partner. So one possible attack is going to be you open a channel with a partner, they hack you and get your key and then sign a tx to them giving them all of the channel balance and then they close the channel to settle which involves all the bitcoin going to their personal address. Think of it as when your debit card gets skimmed except with no recourse to recover your funds.
This is why node/LN wallet security is going to be of paramount importance to achieve mainstream adoption.

That actually is a possibility if you have a bunch of bitcoins and believe that widespread adoption of LN will increase the value of bitcoin. you could essentially ask for no fees or even run your channels at a loss if you were confident the value increase in bitcoin will provide your return.

This is the CNN Money page for what we now know is the day the dotcom bust started. If you look at what they say and then go forward and look at successive days what you *wont* see is people saying "holy crap we are in the middle of a crash!"
Its alot of "well there was bound to be a correction but us this opportunity to buy the dip!" etc. etc.
The point is nobody knows when the crash is happening including anyone who says they are an expert. This is why professional investors in *any* market (who are long) take profits even as the price is still rising.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:44:53
and by "super LN hub" you mean "future Chase Bank acquisition" because if you take a step back and look objectively its pretty clear thats exactly how this will play out.
The *only* way LN will work is if everyone opens multiple channels and keeps them funded with enough liquidity to keep the network moving. And given that Banks made $30 Billion in overdraft fees last year im thinking thats going to be a difficult proposition.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:59:07
The problem with 1. is it breaks the thing that makes LN cool which is having several bi-directional channels so we all can participate in forwarding money around the network. Furthermore if you only send money now you are back to doing on chain tx's to top up your channel.
Also when i go now to Starbucks and they have the starbucks card i can top up and then use it to buy coffee, well thats the same thing as opening a channel with Starbucks but without the $10 on chain tx fee. Granted i cannot (currently) forward payments *beyond* Starbucks with the card but theres no reason they could not add that functionality on their back end if they wanted to get into that business.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:23:55

@_date: 2018-01-02 11:04:35
Yes. assuming everyone has funds to commit to to the hopped transaction. e.g. i pay coinbase so their channel with me has the amount i owe you. then coinbase pays acme with their channel and then acme pays you. so each channel has to have the amount i want to get to you and at the end of tx acme has less in the channel they share with you but more in the channel they share with coinbase.
this will likely not be an issue with coinbase or even acme because we assume they will have more funds to commit to forwarding transactions but if for instance i want to send money to you through Joe needs to have enough on his side of the channel with you to make that tx work.

perspective: if you think wall street guys are sketchy you are correct but don't think for a sec that its not 10x worse in the cryptocurrency markets. 
Bitcoin is the probably the coolest technological innovation of the last 10 years but that doesn't change the fact that the lack of regulation has allowed a huge number of sketchy people to come into this space with the express purpose of taking *your* money. (and one of the angles is specifically the "look at how crooked wall street is so lets get cryptocurrency instead).
you can make money in this space but... Dont. Trust. Anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:45:47
Each transaction is agreed upon and signed by both parties and each party keeps a copy locally. So if Bobs computer explodes Alice can indeed broadcast an earlier tx and get the money and Bob would be screwed. 
Fortunately we know we don't need to ever worry about that because we all know that everyone backs up regularly :)
Seriously though the answer to that is both parties are supposed to store a backup somewhere else so yea billions of transactions on LN stored locally and also backed up. Sounds expensive, doesnt it...

@_date: 2018-01-02 11:28:37
well that was the idea but if you talk to the LN developers when faced with how millions of people are going to settle on the blockchain regularly they started saying "oh no the channels will ideally just stay open indefinitely"
so the end result is you open a channel with a hub and put money in it. then you spend it through the hub and they assess fees. so its effectively the same as a bank account and a debit card (except with less consumer protections). And yes you can close the channel at any time just like you can close your bank account but you dont want to because ultimately they are reliable enough that you want to use them.
Then one day chase buys your hub and sends you a "Chase Lightning" card in the mail and you go "Fuuuuck... how did i end up back here???"
This is why if you want control of your money hubs arent for you; you want to run and manage your channels. Ultimately for most people they wont have the money or the fiscal responsibility to do so so its going to be hubs for them.

A great analogy is to think of the whole thing as a poker game... Normally its something like 4 guys at a table and you can look at the guys and feel them out and see the cards but in this case you are playing poker with 1000's of people and also alot of the people are poker playing robots and also the robots (and some of the people) can see some of the other peoples cards and also the exchange has deals with some of the people and also owns some of the robots and they are working for them and also theres a company called tether that manufactures additional cards for some of the players and also the exchange, some of the players and also the robots are sometimes passing cards between each other under the table to get better hands when it suits them. Also some of the journalists that cover the poker game have deals with all of the above and talk about how the game is pretty easy to win if you just follow this simple betting strategy. Also the other journalists dont have deals but they just know that whatever they publish gets them revenue so they just publish anything and everything that might get your attention.
so yes you could say there is a force of influence at work here...

that doesnt change the fact that a compromise of any channel's signing keys allows a thief to move the money *using* the smart contracts. The smart contracts protect you against your channel partner and other parties during a transfer but they do nothing to protect you against a direct attack.

That would be one of the ways to temper the liquidity issue: imagine a job where you get paid every day instead of every 2 weeks and pay your rent every day instead of once a month. now far less liquidity is needed in channels though there is an associated cost increase in terms of accounting (e.g. does your landlord come knocking if your LN payment for the day doesnt come through? does he even have time to check?)

The tether printing isnt at crazy hyperinflationary levels but its getting close. Right now they only print when the market price of bitcoin drops by large amounts and people want to start exiting coins for a (ideally stable) core position but for the most part crypto investors are not in a huge hurry to get back to USD. A small amount do and they use Kraken which has limited liquidity to exchange USDT to USD.
So effectively they are performing QE in the crypto space and (for now) its stabilizing the price when these big corrections happen.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:37:13
The only reason it bounced at all is because of the $400 Million USDT they printed over the last 4 days...
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:09:13
AFAIK no. The idea is (if you and I open a channel) our refunds are valid before we ever deposit money. But they arent broadcast and even if one of us did right away we still have to wait for the timelock to expire. Now we could do good business and at the end of 30 days say "hey we trust each other to not send that refund tx" and just keep going. That might be enough for us but now we have removed the trustless aspect. 
We can only extend the time by settling and reopening the channel. and the reason for this is because n the timelock value counts down with each successive tx. so if we agree to n=30 for the refund tx and then do business each new tx has to be one lower meaning our max transactions for the channel is 29 before we have to settle it.

if by "completely made up" you mean "100% plausible" then you are correct. 
Point is if you run a node and that node is a computer and the private key is on that computer then a hacker can get control of it (assuming security issues like spectre/meltdown) and make payments. This happens right *now* with banking trojans but the difference is you can at least go to your bank and have them reverse the transactions.

fraud cost my business ~ $4000 last year in lost product but the total reported fraud was higher (we got reimbursed for the rest).
I would agree it justifies the effort. No fees on my end and no fraud payout (whatever the amount) sounds good to me.

There will be incentive to provide higher liquidity: e.g think of it in terms of monthly pay: if a person makes $2000/month and gets paid every 2 weeks then all the channels between employer and employee need a *minimum* of $1000 in them to allow that money to flow (2 week pay periods). So somebody has to be the guy to have money in that channel and he has to make the decision between  having it in the channel and earning crazy small fees on LN or 2% in a govt bond somewhere. 
This is why i believe that there will be opportunity to be the guy who does fund channels so people can route easier. Whats the cost in fees? i figure 2% annual of $1000 is $20/26 weeks = $0.76 per $1000 per pay period would be the fees i would want.

No i get the refund is ideally never committed. I think this might be what they are calling relative OP_CHECKTIMELOCKVERIFY which allows the channel state to be updated but each party still has to regularly check that an old transaction hasnt leaked and then dispute it. The other idea is that there would be insurance services to keep an eye on this for you (but of course thats more fees)
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:01:55
absolutely. which is why everyone with bitcoin should be using a Ledger Nano or Trezor because the state of hot wallet security is currently terrible. You can also use a cold wallet on LN but then you cannot route payments for others automatically so it breaks liquidity.
The way to fix this is to make sure that LN node/wallet implementations are *very* secure but that costs time and money

Yes. Keep in mind the original idea of tether was to create something akin to a "core position" on stock trading sites. So for instance my core position on Fidelity is just a govt money market. Its easier to keep it there rather than to transfer to/from my bank account each time i go in or out of a stock.
With tether (assuming they are really backed against USD then it would be  much more convenient to keep your money in those as you can go in and out of various coins and also move them between exchanges. The problem of course is now everyone is starting to realize that it is more and more likely that tether is *not* backed by USD which means nothing until people want to start cashing out alot of tether for USD (which is starting to happen) and when that happens we will see exchanges limiting or refusing USDT trades.

thats a very good question. The answer is "maybe" (with maybe being how does the govt, banks and fed feel about the whole thing at any given point). Right now bitcoin is considered an asset but with LN it could actually become usable as a currency again in which case it will be important to get clarification.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:46:13
There will still be a need to open close channels if people want to for instance save or borrow money. Remember economies are not trade neutral: people sometimes earn more money than they spend. when that happens in LN the money coming towards your side of the channel bunches up (because you are not spending everything you make so it doesnt all go back to the other side of the channel during any fiscal period.) eventually all the money ends up on your side of the channel and it becomes unbalanced: no more money can flow towards you until your partner rebalances his channels. This is the associated cost of savings incurred on LN in terms of both on chain fees and transaction throughput on the block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:23:20
Bitcoin could definitely have been considered a currency in the past and it was definitely a novelty in the beginning. Bitcoin found use as a currency based on need; granted it was the needs of sketchy dark market guys who thought it was anonymous (oops) but it was actually used as intended even though from a practical standpoint it was not super easy to do. I was one of those people transacting in bitcoin years ago so if you asked me then it was a currency to me. Back then we would bitch about price fluctuations of 5% over a week as being a pain in the ass but it was still useful. The recent speculation has just made using it as a currency impractical for most users and thats what the classic economists are talking about when they pan it.
The value of bitcoin can increase or decrease and as long as the change is gradual it can be useful as currency again. Honestly if we are really talking about bitcoins current usefulness as a currency outside of the pressures of governments its not even proliferating in those spaces: for all the talk of how bitcoin is being used in Venezuela it is a small portion of the black market currency: USD is still how most business is transacted and when bitcoin is used the end goal is to trade it for USD in another country.
The same thing happened with China: the real reason all the Chinese were getting into bitcoin was not to speculate (at least at first) but rather to move money out of China past the currency controls and get it to relatives in US and Canada who then buy property. Now when it started going up by crazy amounts nobody was complaining but after December if you were in the process of moving money out of Venezuela or China and lost 40% when the correction happened it hurt.
The future honestly is going to be some sort of stablecoin tied to a fiat currency that eventually detaches once it proliferates enough. This could be tether if it survives long enough and is found to be on the level. The guy in Venezuela is much better off transacting in USDT because it will at least be relatively stable to USD assuming it doesnt implode soon.

i find that difficult to believe. In fact i think it will be the opposite... Think about the nature of all the current bitcoin transactions; right now the vast majority of bitcoin transactions are a result of moves in and out of bitcoin for speculative reasons or moving bitcoin on/off an exchange. LN is about using bitcoin to actually *spend* on things. Nobody is going to move bitcoin to LN for purposes of speculation with the possible exception of the people who are talking about actually trying to operate exchanges on LN (which is a very cool idea but thats even farther out if it even works). 
Either way if anyone thinks bitcoin transaction backlog and fees are bad now just wait and see what happens if LN takes off.

LN is based on the fact that your node will always have the keys resident and available so that you can forward payments. If the node implementation is insecure or if the OS you are running has some zero day that allows your computer to get pwned you lose all your funds with no recourse. Furthermore since LN basically functions as the worlds biggest bitcoin tumbler you have no hope of ever tracing the money (since it looks like your node sent the money to Joe through Alice and then Bob but all you really know for sure your node sent the money to Alice. Also who even is Joe?)

so this brings up some important discussions that i dont really hear many people talking about: e.g. the idealistic future when everyone is out of fiat and in bitcoin what happens then? Everyone having bitcoin even with it being deflationary is not going to change the fact that inflation (like cost-push inflation) where we run low on some necessary resource like oil or silica for solar panels and the cost of production rises. Whereas with fiat the govt prints more money to allow people to continue to buy those goods at the same rate, with bitcoin since you cant do that the overall cost in bitcoin just goes up instead. So now your bitcoin are worth less tomorrow (because you need a bit more to buy the same stuff). So being in bitcoin you start to lose the same 2-3% over time as you would on the normal inflationary fiat system. 
side note: love your handle ;)

you want to back up *every* transaction (state change) you make on the channel. ideally you can then throw away the older transactions which saves on memory but not on bandwidth.

Bitcoin is *not* anonymous. It can be effectively anonymous if you move the money around to various wallets and cash out in a non regulated (e.g. find a guy with cash and trade your bitcoins) but from a technical standpoint the money can be followed to the cash out point.

Yes. and it gets even more fun from there. We can be preferred payment channels if we all agree to play nice. we always have the option to close the channel and settle things if we disagree on something but instead what we are doing is saying "lets trust each other enough to not have to close the channel because we dont want to have to pay the on chain tx fees of closing a channel and then opening another one. we may decide to *never* close the channel but yes generally we might settle annually for whatever reasons. as a result our costs of running our nodes is lower and on top of that we can grant people access for a higher fee if we can be more reliable.
alternately if we have additional money we arent using we can open a bunch of payment channels and put alot of funds in them so that we have throughput to move alot of payments for other people. so now we are acting like banks and taking a fee so its an actual real investment. I would be perfectly happy to put some of my investment $$ in LN channels if i could earn 2-5% annually on it in fees.

Yes absolutely but in terms of investment there is a bottom limit in terms of what you want to get paid. e.g right now i can take my money and put it in government AAA bonds at 1.7% annually... Like the safest most conservative investment. Why would i (or anyone else) even consider funding a LN hub that has some risk, additional cost and possible regulatory issues for anything less that that amount?

@_date: 2018-01-02 08:31:54
correct. the channel can remain open indefinitely but the contracts you make are ideally timelocked (although they dont have to be but again that opens you up to counterparty risk). The main way this can happen is called an eclipsing attack. The idea is you and I do some business then I broadcast an old transaction (or even the now unlocked refund tx) to the blockchain. Now you have a window that allows you to dispute this with any newer transactions before everything gets finalized and i can even be penalized and lose additional funds if this is the case. But what if i do something to knock you off of the internet or hack your entry point to obscure whats going on, or i just bonk you in the head with an oversized mallet and leave you in a ditch long enough that you cant do that?
So now we get into a situation where we all either settle channels regularly because too much balance builds up on one side to make an attack more tempting *or* we only decide to open channels with counterparties that are known to be unlikely to ever do this to us (which we already have which are called banks)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:47:12
So the quicky version of how it works is you have a node and at least 2 channels open with 2 different people. If someone wants to route money through you what is effectively happening is channel balance gets pushed to your side in one channel (plus a small fee) and then you push the same amount less the fee towards the far side of the other channel. So if you look at the individual channels it looks like you gained money in one channel and lost it in the other but your aggregate balance is the same (plus the fee).
The thing is to do this you need to have money sitting in one of your channels to go out the far side and that money sitting there is not earning interest when it could be in a govt bond or something at 2% so it stands to reason that if you leave additional funds in a channel to route payments you will want to make at least as much (if not more)
The money in each channel is really still just sitting on the blockchain; its never actually in the nodes... the nodea are just an abstraction of iou's you make with your channel partner as to who owns what percentage of the total balance.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:09:14
no you're getting it wrong: I'm saying as a vendor i will incur *zero* cost of fraud and also i will not be paying the 1-3% visa fee.
Right now when you buy something from me I pay 1.2% (i have good rates) and if you get your card skimmed and you call it in visa charges me back the money (even though i am out the product) and now i have to jump through hoops of paperwork to *sometimes* get reimbursed.
With LN now *you* pay the fees to get the money to me and also *you* cover the cost of your fraud. Trust me i literally cannot wait for LN mainnet to get a bit more stable and start taking payments.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:10:00
I would hope so but think about it in historical terms... Do you think for example the early US govt didnt have all these discussions when they were attempting to create the national currency/banking. I guarantee that one of the guys back in 1800 was like "How is this 'Dollar' ever going to scale to 5 million people?" (that was the population in 1800) and some other guy was like "By the time we get to 5 million people things will be much different"
And now here we are 200 years later with a crazy inflated currency and massive debt. The point is bitcoin had massive promise and was actually working for a while but greed is killing it now and attempting to fix it with LN is going to cause both to fail. LN needs to stand on its own to work at scale.

exchanges and hubs are going to have far less incentive to hack their channel partners since it hurts their business which is why the LN system is likely to gravitate to that model. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:04:39
To add to this another possible attack would be someone who is multiple hops away hacks you and gets your key. So lets say your channel partner is your best friend but your friend has a channel with another person and that person has a channel with the attacker. The attacker then initiates a signed tx to him through your friend and his friend. The attacker then closes his channel and gets the funds. So now you realize your node signed away all your funds and you got hacked. You tell your friend not to close the channel because its not a legit tx and your friend says the same thing to their friend. Their friend doesnt know you and probably doesnt care because they forwarded the payment to the hacker. and their channel is closed so they close the channel with your friend as well to finalize. Now your friend is faced with the dilemma: either eat the loss (which is not their fault) and sign a tx refunding the money to you or close the channel.

which i am not... but... life also happens; alot of guys who are now "bitcoin rich" are going to run into a situation where there will be a correction or bear market... bitcoin will likely recover but in the meantime their kid gets sick and they need money for a non covered procedure. Or a flood happens and they need money to fix the house or whatever. All those guys that bought at $19K and are now way down will be fine if they wait a few months or a year or two but that means nothing if they *cant* wait.
so yes sometimes you just have to suck it and lose the 2% annually on some of your money so you can have it ready to go tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:41:23
A well engineered wallet/node will hide all the difficult stuff after you buy the bitcoin. So imagine you go on an exchange and buy bitcoin. Now you transfer to your LN "wallet" but what that really is is a software suite that handles your on-the chain address and your channel addresses. so you just look at an interface that looks like a mobile banking interface with your savings and checking.
Of course this is waaaayyyy down the road and someone still is going to need to be accountable for fuckups. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:53:35
you have to keep in mind that the way counterparty risk is handled is by having a time locked refund in place *before* you fund the channel. now you can set the time to whatever you want (the whitepaper uses examples like 10 or 30 days with the idea being that if your channel partner is uncooperative you close the channel, pay the tx fee but you still have to wait the time to get your money back. The catch of course is the channel must be settled before the refund tx timelock expires or the original party can take their money back regardless of what transactions have been made after.
So it comes down to how much do you trust the person you are opening a channel with and how long are you willing to wait to get your money back if your partner doesnt cooperate... And keep in mind i am not talking about the "scumbag" case that everyone brings up... what happens if you open a channel with your good friend that you trust and set a timelock of a year and the next day that person gets hit by a bus... 
Institutional investors will be happy to open channels with people for long periods (for a fee of course) which then keeps the number of settled txs lower but the average person actually trying to spend money on a daily basis is going to be faced with either settling monthly and paying tx fees or settling annually but with an established vetted counterparty but also paying fee (2-5%)
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:15:10
Im assuming you are asking from a taxation standpoint and not the deflationary aspect (although both present issues). 
In terms of taxation it is still going to have to happen in some form whether or not everyone moves to bitcoin lest we want to privatize all our infrastructure, build castles and hire our own knights for protection (the homeless we can just turn into soylent green which solves both the problem of the homeless and also creates new supply which helps with bitcoins deflationary nature) :)

*central hubs *will* be hacked. without a doubt. SWIFT got hacked along with every other major financial institution. Operational security of bitcoin has gotten so bad that this cool thing that works over the internet and transcends borders has been subverted by us having to take the super high tech step of writing down our keys on a piece of fucking paper and hiding it somewhere. 
So now with LN the idea is to keep those keys on a server somewhere because the transfer hops are all automated and trust that the whole thing doesnt get hacked? it going to be a bloodbath.

This depends on your concerns and intent: e.g. are you concerned bitcoin will lose value against fiat and you want to buy some stuff? Do you not need to buy stuff but the concern is that all the recent speculators might still cause some loss of value? Do you have an IRA? have you funded your contribution? Al these things matter.
At the very least since the promise of bitcoin isnt quite there yet you will likely want to move some money back into fiat so paying as little taxes as possible (legally) is important. Look up "Backdoor Roth IRA" and get with a tax advisor.

absolutely. Open an account on every exchange for a small amount of money and get bitcoin but leave them on the exchange. Then get with some lawyers and have them prepare class action lawsuit documents with you as lead plaintiff. Then when everything goes to crap you file for fraud against every exchange that becomes insolvent.
Once everyone joins the suit you will make *alot* of money.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:03:20
you can keep the channels open as long as you want *but* to do this you have to set your initial refund tx timelock as long as the maximum you wish to keep the channel open. This means if anything goes wrong you have to wait that long to get your money back out of the channel.
So in the instance of you opening a channel with say Starbucks you might be ok with a year because Starbucks is big and is unlikely to become insolvent and they want to regularly sell you coffee and also broker the transaction between you and Jimmy Johns for the  TBO you get every thursday (for a small fee of course) but you arent going to want to open a channel with a year timelock with your weed dealer because you dont know when the cops are going bust him and you dont want to wait a year to get your money out.

Maximum theoretical tx size with segwit is 12K/block and then Schnorr has a theoretical increase of 25%. So 15K.

That is true but the payoff is the fraud protection... e.g. im an engineer: i know exactly what a skimmer looks like and i dont use my cards on sites that look sketchy. Still my business card gets hit like 1-2x a year. Chase sends me a new card and fixes everything. I pay nothing.
So like look at spectre/meltdown... these are really really bad exploits and while we dont *know* of any of their use in the wild it doesnt mean that some hackers didnt low key know about and use those exploits quite successfully... to steal someones bitcoin.
Now there are ways to fix this problem: one such way is to create a hardened LN "box" that holds all the channel keys and and only allows automated signing of tx's if money coming in balances money going out but you physically have to press a button to enable just a payment tx; so like a cold wallet but its not a whole computer or software running on a computer but rather a secure box that plugs into USB. so now the attack surface is just USB which is easier to secure.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:30:11
correct. All channel transactions are expected to be stored locally on that node (with the idea you also back up to somewhere else). If the hard drive crashes or your place burns down you need to have a backup and you will lose any txs up to the last backup. Now keep in mind that your channel partner doesnt necessarily know you have lost your txs so they can just keep transacting with you after you come back online and it would be fine (because new txs invalidate older ones). If however they know you lost some txs they can exploit this to close the channel with a previous state that is monetarily favorable to them.

So basically i bought NVDA 14 months ago when it was around $60. I started looking at it right before earnings. I work in automotive electronics so i follow autonomous vehicles and I also follow machine learning and if you followed those back then (meaning actually talk to the people doing that stuff) they were all talking about how they were using nvidia GPUs for their work but when i talked to other investors about NVDA all they ever had to say was "gaming" so i knew the future potential value of NVDA was not priced into the market at that point. (You know this is especially true by following all the financial news outlets and see that they are *not* talking about this and in fact some were even suggesting the stock would decline.)
A year goes by and now everyone is talking about NVDA: for gaming, AI, Autonomous, and as a bonus this crypto craze. And the articles are saying things like "Why NVDA still has nowhere to go but up!!!" and thats when you know the stock is priced properly or even possibly overpriced. Additionally I start to notice nvidia insiders selling off some shares of their stock. This is a typical precursor to when a sell off will happen.
Keep in mind that all things aside NVDA is still a great stock, and a profitable company and should recover to at least $200-$220 over the next several months (assuming this crypto craze doesnt implode within that timeframe... ) I still have a bunch of shares left that i did not sell because i havent held them a year (i would pay much higher tax rate if i sold them then vs if i just wait longer) Those I will probably just hold on to long term. If you are down on NVDA right now but dont need the money understand that at some point further out in the future it will be a $300+ stock.

That sounds about right except for the opening/closing channels each month. It doesnt scale: the blockchain can process somewhere around 10,000,000 transactions per month. That means lightning could only ever service 5,000,000 people assuming LN uses *all* of the blockchain.

initial funding of a channel is done with a time locked refund in place. if you fund the channel and your counterparty in the channel decides to not cooperate and never signs any transactions you will eventually get your money back but only after the refund unlocks. Normally this would be in 30 days (or maybe 10 in some examples). This opens the system up to a attacks where you open a channel and fund it and then your counterparty holds your money hostage for however many days unless you agree to a higher price, etc.
its only after at least one tx is signed/agreed upon by both parties that you can close the channel.

What determines the price of any item is one thing and one thing only: what some other person (or entity) is willing to buy or sell it for. On markets the way this works is that many traders place limit orders which in effect say (i want to sell bitcoins but only at 15000) or (i want to buy bitcoins but only at 14900). the market price is somewhere in between these 2 numbers. 
If you want to for instance buy some coins and you place a market order the exchange will look and see who is the lowest guy who has a limit sell order on the book and you will pay his asking price. now the market price is that price. if you happened to buy everything he wanted to sell at that price and the next guy has an even higher price that he is willing to sell at then the market price starts going up.
Thats the simplified version. The reality is that its much more complicated than that with all sorts of seen and unseen forces (big money, smart small money, trading bots, high frequency trading bots, hacked exchange code, order spoofing, painting the tape, and monopoly money) all having an additional effect on overall price.

That's not entirely true: I am in tech stocks and i sold off a large portion before this recent shift. I had no insider info other than reading about how several fund managers had been talking about shifting to other sectors towards the end of the year going into 2018. 
At any rate your concerns about the stock market are valid but if you think cryptocurrencies are better in this respect you are very mistaken. In *any* market there will always be big big money moving the markets in directions that are not (necessarily) in the interests of smaller guys like us. The difference is that with cryptocurrencies there are also things like direct collusion between the markets and traders, lack of audit or recourse, and direct value manipulation (tethers anyone?)
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:29:50
Yes I get that. US mortgage payments alone would use up all the bitcoin on chain bandwidth. So unless those are made on LN it’s never going to scale. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:20:08
So the point of using accounting firm and lawyer is they are literally just enforcing a legal contract for a fee (think of how legal trusts are managed). They are held to much higher legal/ethical scrutiny than any of the current cryptocurrency markets.The accounting firm doesnt ever get to touch the money: its in a bank account. They just either give it to you or to me and make sure you get your coins back at the end of the contract.
Now yes there is alot of volatility but you can specify the amount of leverage you are comfortable with. There is alot of big money out there that would have no problem backing what they borrowed with 5X or even 10X because to them a short squeeze is just part of doing business and they understand how/when to close a losing position.
Yes it is more complicated (much more so than just buying a bunch of coins on coinbase) but its inherently wayyy less risky (FDIC insured account vs questionable/insolvent exhange or wallet getting hacked or hard wallet failing and losing keys). Also it offers hedging and tax deferment which are all problems the newly bitcoin rich are going to start having to deal with...
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:38:22
That still requires an on chain tx to do and there is not enough tx bandwidth to handle that if bitcoin hits mass adoption 
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:54:39
So then we’re back to the original problem of needing channels with large multi thousand dollar balances so people can pay their mortgages. Which was OPs original question.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:28:03
My business is a smaller regional business and we do ~10 2-5K transactions per day so yes we could batch but what mortgage payments? 
There’s 14 million mortgages is the us alone so 14,000,000 payments each month. Now forget the fact that everyone pays towards the end of the month, even if you spread them out to all days that’s still 5.4 txs per second. So just US mortgage payments max out the bitcoin network. 
Even if everyone batches all their payments into one monthly payment there still nowhere near enough bandwidth (nevermind the rest of the world and all business etc.
LN is the only shot and that means large channel balances

you can absolutely short it; short selling has been around for at least 2000 years if not longer. It existed before regulated markets. You just have to find a guy willing to let you borrow his bitcoins for some amount of time.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:31:05
The question of whether shorting is a good idea is a different discussion, but the article is talking about shorting via futures whereas i am talking about directly shorting the coins which if you want to short is probably much safer than *any* of the markets given the lack of regulation/oversight.
I do agree it would be better to be long on something that moves inversely to bitcoin (are any state lotteries publicly traded?)

@_date: 2017-12-26 05:45:41
no absolutely not. if i want to short 2 bitcoins you do a transaction on the blockchain and send them to my wallet. (after we do the contract). Then i cash them out and deposit them in the escrow account. Here is the great part: since you didn't cash them out you technically haven't taken a profit so you have deferred tax liability. In the meantime im making payments to you (the interest) in fiat which you can use (although you do have to pay taxes on the interest). In the meantime you have also hedged your position on those 2 bitcoins at the market price at the time we entered into the contract. If i was correct and the price goes down you still get your coins back and if you are bullish you believe they will go back up anyway so you have no loss long term. If i was wrong then you still get your coins back but now they are worth more vs fiat. Either way the only taxable part is the interest received. In either case you can opt to also cash settle the contract which just means i dont buy the bitcoins back but rather give you the cash value. (and you then pay taxes but at the end of the contract so again you deferred your taxes).
Also if the price of bitcoin declines i still am typically buying back the coins (albeit at a lower price) to give back to you but also because i am buying i am adding to demand which stabilizes the decline so your other coins you hold lose less value.
Incidentally if we had proper shorting/futures in the cryptocurrency markets this last crash would likely not have occurred. I am actually a big believer in the idea of cryptocurrencies but when I come into the bitcoin subreddit and see that 98% of the people here think that any discussion of bear positions is bad then that is where we get into trouble.

That’s incorrect. The maximum (on chain) transactions per second throughput is around 7. There’s no way to increase that without major changes to the bitcoin code that would take away the things that make it bitcoin (like decentralization) 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:48:20
Example would be: you are a "HODL'er", you have a bunch of bitcoins and have no intention of selling them in forseeable future. I wish to take a bear position. So if we can agree on terms we meet up with a third party (lawyer, accounting firm) and write up a contract between us. you let me borrow some amount of bitcoin which i intend to sell at market value now and then return the same amount of bitcoins back to you at some agreed upon date in the future. So basically you could even sell that amount of coins or give them to me and sell them but that money goes into an escrow account. I also have to deposit an additional amount of money into the account (because i could be wrong and bitcoin could go up) and of course we would need to agree upon terms of how much bitcoin could appreciate before the short needed to be covered. The lawyer and accounting firm would have control over the money so they would effectively manage our counterparty risk (for a fee of course).
We've just entered into a shorting contract only we are not using any (possibly sketchy) exchange and the contract is not cash settled because the bitcoins are *actually* sold and then bought back so it would actually be much safer. (And also more work because we would actually have to deal with real intermediaries)
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:50:44
Basically right now most accountants/tax advisors do not want to touch cryptocurrencies because of the lack of regulation and paperwork. The real issue surrounds 1. figuring out cost basis and therefore actual gains and 2. from the accountant's perspective making sure they are not complicit to a crime (like money laundering, etc.)
In terms of paying taxes you always have the option of just claiming 0 cost basis on anything you convert to fiat that you cannot provide records for.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:32:30
just like with shorting via a brokerage the long side gets a fee/interest on the "loan" of some amount. (whatever is agreed to) For stocks this can be up to 20%. This is extremely advantageous if you hold alot of bitcoins and arent really sure how to get money out easily because the contract can be structured so the interest is paid in fiat so you can actually buy stuff you need.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:39:55
Isn’t LN layer 2?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:45:19
i would consider working a direct shorting contract with any of the various HODL'ers willing to back their long position (and possibly make extra money if they are correct). Literally borrow the bitcoins, sell them at market price and then deposit the money in an escrow account along with additional money to cover (your margin if you are wrong)

If things ever get bad enough that the FDIC and US Dollar collapses there wont be reliable internet and there definitely will not be reliable power infrastructure to support bitcoin mining. And when the power gets cut and miners drop off the difficulty will adjust but not right away. So you will have a situation where mining power will be drastically reduced and *at the same time* everyone holding bitcoin will need to start transacting in it all at the same time. The network will slow to a crawl and will stay that way for a while.

I dont agree with that and there are two commodities we can look at for parallels: gold and oil. Im not referring to supply change but rather when market forces cause the price to drop below production costs. When that happens production shuts down. We have seen the same thing with bitcoin miners.
If lots of new people come into the mining business and the resulting difficulty increase drives up the price it will eventually reach a limit where the new money coming in says "Im interested in bitcoin but X amount is too high." just like we see in stocks.
Case and point NVDA: I made lots of money on it last year and would buy back in but right now the cost of the stock is too high. It doesnt mean that i dont think the company has value; i think they are an amazing company but for me (and lots of guys like me) Im not paying $250 for it.

What he talks about in the video is the *transient* capacity which is keeping a natural gas turbine spun up but is not always connected but has to be ready for when everyone gets home and turns pon their A/C at the same time. Bitcoin miners *cannot* use this additional capacity: it has to be wasted because it has to be available to use at a moments notice.

Very true but at the same time putting your faith in bitcoin means dealing with the possibility of it losing almost all its value. Now everyone says that they are ok with this but then the Mt Gox trustee goes to sell a a few thousand coins, something he is *absolutely* entitled to do and legally *required* to do and everyone throws a fit.
What do you think is going to happen if those million coins ever get dumped on the market?

You are forgetting albedo. Adding solar generation changes overall reflectivity and as we improve efficiency of PV panels more heat is absorbed.

If it was/is a plot yes I agree they could have engineered it much better but that does not mean its not valid. The idea is if you tie up too much of the supply then people immediately are concerned with the possiblity of mass dilution of value. the 1/16 number is interesting because its small enough that the concern of dilution is offset by the usefulness of the coin but also big enough that the entire system can be influenced.
At any rate all debate aside about the original intent for tying up those million bitcoin (which is fun to do) The real point is they *could* be moved assuming the entity is still in control of them.

At any rate you're missing the point: I dont care. Ive been invested in bitcoin since long before most people here. I actually used bitcoin as a currency until it became untenable. I made money on it then and made money when it was speculative and when the big financial entities come in I will make money again (LN).

The premise of the paper is: Mining costs are getting cheaper (Antminer S9 cuts mining cost of a bitcoin by 66%) and lots of capacity is coming online but somehow price is supposed to go up even though the market economics since idk forever shows the exact opposite. 
Bitcoin *will* go up in the future but only because of demand increase and that happens because of wall street and regulation coming into the space.

No, this is for *all* energy generation. Even if the energy is generated from solar power its when the energy is *used* heat is created. (Think the waste heat created by the mining rigs themselves). We buy time by moving from fossil fuels to renewables because the createion of energy from fossil fuels creates waste heat but we staill have to deal with the waste heat from energy *use*
There is a hard thermodynamic limit and that is what limits the growth of mining to an upper bound before the sheer number of mining rigs create enough waste heat to change the local temperature.

That doesn’t make sense: the *entire* market cap for bitcoin is $120B... FB alone lost that in one day. When the entire market undergoes a correction the amounts moving out of the market are in the *trillions* and if all the bitcoin in the world were used as a hedge it would have little effect (not that it matters since a large amount of the bitcoin in existence aren’t even in circulation.

That doesn’t even mean it’s necessarily illogical. There are other benefits/motives besides pure profit (eg Elon Musk with Tesla).
When oil producers continue to operate at a loss it’s often a long game: they have contracts and relationships and they know (hope?) that the price will rise in the future and they will eventually be net profitable. Then there’s dumping. We could easily see a situation where a mining pool mines at below cost until a competing pool loses so much money they leave the space. 
Ultimately though if people continue mining bitcoin below cost long term for neither of these reasons then it *is* illogical but worse what is then happening is bitcoin is basically being subsidized.
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:48:41
No i get all that. I even said we arent discussing the supply aspect because it remains constant but rather the cost of mining 1 btc is going down because the new mining rigs are more efficient. Now granted that will be offset to some degree by new miners coming into the pools which will send the price back up but by how much and when is the big question (since we cannot quantify variables like 1. rate of new miners entering the pool 2. rate of S9 replacing S7 3. Power costs chaning due to regulation etc.) but forget about all that for one sec.
The part that doesnt make sense is where they come up with the $36,000 figure for 1 btc. There is a price where despite the rarity people simply arent going to pay that price. A good example is Osmium. Its 4x more rare and precious than gold but trades at 1/3 the price and while some people speculate in osmium and other rare precious metals there simply isnt enough demand to push that price higher than $400. Same is going to be the case with bitcoin unless something changes to make it more desirable to new money coming in.

what do you think is going to happen with bitcoin. Granted the "printing money" part by design cannot happen but *all* of the other bad things: margin, derivatives, futures,CDO's, etc can and *are* happening. 
Tether is a great example of this in that because of various fincen regulations there was a need for a "proxy" currency to allow traders to move in and out of bitcoin. That part was a good idea (aside from you know using USD, fiat as the base currency) but then once bitcoin and USDT became the defacto trading pair for all these overseas exchanges what happened? well they cant print more bitcoin but they can print more USDT which *indirectly* inflates bitcoin.
Fiat definitely encourages loose monetary policy but dont think for a second the same wont happen with bitcoin or *any* other crypto.

I guess i didnt explain the specifics. Enough colluding miners can force a hard fork. Once they do this they can run their own nodes. We know this can happen because it *has* happened. Now granted the BCH fork was a half-assed effort but they still managed to take 1/6 of bitcoins value with them. 
Theres only 10,000 nodes worldwide and there was a paper not too long ago showing efficiencies allowing a full node for $5/month. That means consensus attack could be performed for a cost of ~$50K/month (which is peanuts in the grand scheme of things considering how big bitcoin will get)

They can detect the network traffic to the mining pools. A miner can attempt to use SSH tunneling or Tor but the DNS lookup indicates covert mining.

Have you seen the warranty period on Antminers? 90 days. And they fail often given the fact that the nature of the business is to run them 24/7 as close to the limit as possible. This means that even if there was no growth the miners are always going to need to replace equipment regularly and the newer equipment will mine bitcoins at a lower price. 
The miners capital outset keeps them competitive so they can make more money or bring new money into the space by selling cheaper. Everytime the price drops (like right now) a lot of the coins being sold are the newly mined coins so in a way they act to stabilize the price at some lower bound and overall the supply remains constant for the next few years. 
Demand and capital inflow are what is going to get the price above 10K.

Sure you could. Almost every country has a National Identification number. Bitcoin could have been set up from the start where the blockchain had ~7 billion addresses, one corresponding to each individual number. Your individual coin is yours no matter what, you just have to present indntification once in person and set up you public/private key set to unlock it. If people arent ok with identifying themselves they dont have to collect the coin, or they can wait as long as they want or they can buy coins on the secondary market.

Fair enough. Like I said earlier I wasnt trying to debate the specifics of how difficult it would be to do such a thing just rather that it was technically possible (even if improbable). 
The point of the discussion was to gauge the community reaction to either inflation or deflation from the original standard because the long term prospects of bitcoin once more complex financial instruments really take hold are what interest me. 
I could have started with "How will you like it when derivatives or  CDO's effectively increase or decrease price by inflating or deflating the effective liquidity of bitcoin" but that wouldnt get many answers because 98% of the *normal* investing public have no idea how CDO's work much less crypto investors.

No doubt underutilized power and subsidized power is driving bitcoin mining. Im not arguing that. What i am saying is the knock-on effect of *using* all that power and then trending that into the future creates a waste heat problem that is practically unsolvable. 
In reality the surplus power will get used up and/or governments will put the brakes on power usage for environmental reasons and then any new miners wanting to compete will not be able to which will create a natural price equilibrium and upper limit.

Agreed but even in a world without fiat currency (as we know now) we will have something to replace it. In another post I outlined how with LN (if it goes mainstream) will give rise to leveraging just like banks have now with lending... here is how.
If you and I are businesses and we transact on LN and we do so for a period of time where we both trust each other enough to know our relationship is long term then one day I grant you "double bitcoin". It doesnt have to be double, it could be any multiple. Basically the LN (which is open source) gets cloned and a duplicate copy runs for businesses that trust eachother but with no underlying blockchain but *is* backed by a bunch of bitcoin held in an account on the regular blockchain. I now tell you you have another bitcoin on LN2 for every regular bitcoin you have on LN in your channel with me which you can spend with anyone you want to also on that network with the understanding that it has to be settled after some time period.
You can use your new LN2 bitcoin or not use them but you have them. And now the bitcoin total supply has been inflated above the 21 million coin limit. This will happen. (It kinda is happening but i cant say too much about it)

The post started out by saying "if you bought at $1000 and got mocked well you showed them just by holding". Fine so thats either true or not. But Cisco (which is not just some random company btw: the entire network portion of infrastructure that bitcoin runs on is Cisco) So if its true then it should have held true for Cisco but it didnt which means it might not hold true for bitcoin.
Or its not true: we go by the thesis that the hyperbolic curve each time indicates a speculative bubble in which case any investor should have known that at that portion of the curve it was late in the game and you are indeed retarded to invest at that point.
If you care about bitcoin *long term* like everyone tries to pretend they do then it doesnt matter what price you buy at which means you lead the post with "if you bought at X price" because who cares what the price is relative to fiat.

Theres plenty liquidity to move in and out of btc to USDT or other coins but for the Gox trustee he has to get USD and there is only so much new USD coming into this space.

There is alot of debate as to whether those 650,000 btc *ever* existed. Its not like we can see them just sitting there on the blockchain. They literally cannot to this day account for much of thier business because they had such terrible accounting procedures (read: nonexistant). 
If this happened today and they could see the coins and track them then it would be similar to how the DAO hack was handled, e.g rollback.

People said that when CSCO went from $80 to $40... 
Oh wait, Cisco is still $40 18 years later. Bitcoin may very well climb back up above $19K but it might take 4 years or 20 years for that to happen and that means nothing to the guy that needs that investment money in a year because his kid needs braces or the roof needs to be replaced.
Investment is all about timescale: how long can you afford to *not* touch the money. I *know* someone that bought in 2014 at $1000 and then in 2015 their roof started failing. They put it off as long as they could until the water was literally being colleted in pots and pans and finally had to sell their bitcoin in 2016 for $400... It doesnt matter what bitcoin did from then on because he needed the money (and ironically no roofer would accept bitcoin)

That’s incorrect: iceberg ordering is done to hide the amount of the total order. It has little to effect on price change unless the order is broken up and spread over large timescales.
The premise of the article is that order amounts large or small do not move the price in any normal way and this makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:20:43
So you are saying that people should put off investment because the future is unknown and money might be needed?
That's kind of terrible advice. Investment is always about timescales: you put money in with the understanding you might need it at some point.
Also consider that the *entire* run up of bitcoin last year was based on millennials with no safety net and existing debt taking whatever money they had plus maxing out credit cards to get bitcoins. If you took all that away the price would have never gone above $3000

Bitcoin is riskier because of the lack of regulation. If you invest in Apple stock and Apple for whatever reason falls on hard times there is still book (instinsic) value and securities regulation protecting you to some degree. 
With bitcoin the risks are higher: you can get hacked and lose your bitcoin. China can take control of the miners and vastly change the value of your investment, etc. While the chances of those events are statistically small they are still present and as such a bitcoin investment needs to provide a higher return to reflect that.

You would never want to short bitcoin to zero for the simple fact that if bitcoin went to zero exchanges would start to become insolvent and you would likely never be able to settle and collect your earnings.

In any unregulated market there are manipulators working to move the price in both directions. What matters is the medium to long term price direction which is a function of money moving in or out of the market.
Right now money is moving out of bitcoin.

This is incorrect: Theres big players in stocks (and all other markets for that matter) that have a alot of say...
With stocks good news means increased value because it \*directly\* translates to additional value. e.g. Nvidia says "hey we sold a metric fuck-ton of GPUs at great margins because everyone is mining cryptocurrencies" and we know that as a result Nvidia has more money in the bank at the end of the day which means each share of NVDA stock is entitled to a portion of that money.
Contrast this with bitcoin. For the average holder of bitcoin what does current positive news do for value? Ok we have todays news that Facebook is going to allow cryptocurrency ads. That sounds good because ads will bring new people to bitcoin (assuming there are people still interested but lets say that is the case). So if more people want bitcoin that drives demand but it does not increase the value of a bitcoin to you or me. We still cant spend it in more places nor does it our ability to store value long term increase. So for us the \*utility\* of bitcoin is unchanged and therefore its value stays the same (outside of speculative value)

There was a nightclub a block down the street from my building. I like nightclubs, especially when they are fun, not overpriced and well run. Well the nightclub down the street was not: it wasn’t so much the fault of the people running it but more so that the location was poor, it had poor sound, the entertainment was inconsistent, etc. it had been other nightclubs in the past and they had all failed. 
The failure was because of poor design: the location didn’t not fulfill its purpose of being a place that where people could drink and hand have fun and listen to good music.
One night I hear sirens so I head outside to look at what’s going on. As I walk towards the building I see huge flames erupting out of the roof of the building. The fire burned so hot that it took two days to fully put out. I sat across the street with many other people and watched for hours as beautiful embers floated down around me and as various parts of the building collapsed. 
Well bitcoin is that nightclub. I knew one day that place was going to burn because that was the only logical end to the place and just like the nightclub there are many of us that saw the same thing would happen with bitcoin because even though it had good prospects it was flawed from the beginning and while it could serve some purposes the community greed and speculation sent it on a path that could only end this way. 
And again here we are sitting in this subreddit watching the embers slowly fall all around us.

you guys are missing the real issue here: Bitcoin has an average daily volume of like 750,000 to 1,000,000 bitcoins traded. So how is it that 6000-20000 extra bitcoins can crash the market?
Well it makes perfect sense when someone is only selling those coins for actual fiat (as the trustee had to) and not tether. If you take tether out of the market the price of bitcoin will go back to early 2017 prices.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:10:51
correct. This reminds me of barter dollars. In many cities they have these barter systems where businesses basically trade products and services for these barter dollars which (like tether) are supposed to be 1 to 1 against USD. The problem is nobody wants to take the barter dollars because they have few places to spend them so when we would sell products we would take say $100 USD for the product or $400 barter dollars. And people with an excess of barter dollars would pay the $400 price mostly because they charged 4x as much for whatever they sold for barter dollars.
The point is the barter dollars werent really worth a dollar and everyone knew it. This is whats happening with tether. And to be honest right now i know guys who are sitting on a bunch of USDT that are willing to pay me more for some of my products if ill take USDT instead.

@_date: 2018-03-18 12:07:53
I agree thats the case now but where i see this happening is when LN gets a bit further along. Specifically the case thats been concerning me is the liquidity issue: e.g. I know my friends and aside from the smallest purchases they simply dont have it together enough to have to run LN channels with enough liquidity to handle my purchasing (remember 69% of americans have less than $1000) At the same time I know for a fact that businesses do not want to open channels with every one of their customers because they do not want to be in the payment processing business.
So that leaves us with 2 possibilities. One is the obvious hubs which makes this attack less feasible as described but does not mitigate it (the attack would work the same with the hub being the loser but we can also surmise that hubs being in business will have fraud mitigation procedures in place to defend against these sorts of attacks although this will cost money which means higher fees)
the second possibility will be that secondary mediators will pop up; something like " open a connection with channelco, our fees are lower by this amount and we connect to these people. The attacker opens lots of connections to these intermeidaries and the problem is that any losses incurred get passed on as fees.
The end result is any user of LN is going to (eventually) be paying 1-3% anyway to cover the cost of fraud.
Make no mistake these attacks ( and others we havent even thought about yet) will happen and people will lose money and then the system will evolve to mitigate against it. but this will cost money. The worst thing we can do it to say "its never going to happen" or "this is too far out there" or "this is just shills causing problems" (although that may also be their intention) it doesnt matter. Attacks will happen and people need to be discussing what to do about it proactively.
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:55:10
yea but then how am i going to slowly go insane?
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:41:43
So the idea is lets say im the attacker. I open lots of channels with Hubco; a big node/processor. I buy lots of stuff through businesses that hubco services and also send money to other channels i also control. Then i close those channels with the recieved money and/or get the goods. Then i send early channel state txs on the depleted channels and then immediately spam the crap out of the bitcoin network so the hub cannot broadcast the penalty tx. 
Like i said a big hub will likely mitigate by having a deal where they always have emergency txs available but this cost will be passed on to us but the smaller upstart hubs will not do this to keep costs down and will take a hit. Or something like that. Keep in mind this is all just sunday morning conjecture but i honestly cant see any reason why this wouldnt work.
I guess what im saying is that its a mistake to say "well this requires alot of planning its not likely; its an edge case" because history has shown people will try anything and sometimes succeed. A great example of this is the DAO hack. It was very well thought out and engineered; they knew about this exploit and planned it and were able to execute it quite brilliantly; The only reason they never got the ether is because etherium elected to do a hard fork. And they still profited because its widely believed they shorted ether in conjunction with the attack.  
Yes these are exciting times and honestly i think LN has a chance but it wont happen if everyon adopts the attitude of (well the LN guys will figure this out). Just our discussion here these past few hours will be seen by others and get alot of people thinking about these issues and thats what really matters regardless of our opposing positions.

True. wash trading using artificial liquidity which is the real reason they printed all that tether.

side note: even if LN has 1-3% fees i still want to use it eventually when it becomes more mature. Im just not deluded about the fact that fees will be there. I figure with LN/bitcoin you will be able to make the choice: more fraud protection for 3% or less for 1% which is a cool choice to have. we dont with credit cards so i have to get my discount as miles which i do not use nearly enough. ( we rack up millions of miles each year and i dont travel so my partner gets to go on lots of trips)

*except for this guy
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:24:57
Yes me as well but most people are averse to loss and this attack ruins the trustless nature of LN e.g. People will only want to open channels with people they feel they can trust, which will end up being immediate friends, businesses and hubs. The whole point was that anyone can open channels with anyone and be confident their funds are safe.
I practice reverse engineering and security analysis of systems and while i agree the attack doesnt have all the aspects perfectly fleshed out I cant see any big show stopping reason why it *wouldnt* work. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:24:10
I see what you are getting at. I think the guy who came up with this posited that the attacker needed to have enough funds to keep the attack going long enough to outlast the 1000 block timelock (which is something like 7 days i think) so yes it would require substantial funds to mount but not undoable. The idea is the attacker broadcasts the bundle old txs for all the channels at 10 sat/byte and attempts to time the spamming to start right after these are incorporated. Its also possible that a hub could respond fast enoungh to get some of the penalty txs broadcasted to at least limit the damage. 
The other thing i worry about is the 1000 block timelock is going to go down for alot of people. Think about how many people we know that complain when chase locks them out of their debit card for 3 days due to fraud. Alot of people have so little saved that they will not want their funds locked in a channel for even 7 days. For guys like you or me we could set up even 10000 block locks and we would be ok because (and im guessing you are like me) have money set aside for contingencies but other people are far more likely to set up channels that they can exit quicker for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:58:45
the other good mitigation strategy i saw (forgot who posted it) was to change the timeout to 10000 blocks but im guessing the attack wont be mounted against people with high timeout values. poorer people will choose even *lower* timeout values because they cannot afford the possibility of lack of access to funds for extended periods
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:44:50

no you misunderstand the issue. The attack vector (if it stands up to scrutiny) exists no matter what. So how could one mitigate? well if you are a LN intermediary or payment processor one way is to go to the miners and say "we need a guaranteed number of tx slots to hedge against attacks and we will enter into a deal to prepay for x amount of txs at this price (the amount being whatever they work out provides a suitable safety margin) then the hub will attempt to use those tx slots in full and if they dont they will sell them to other entities at a market price. Yes there will be a whole new business market centered around buying and selling tx slots/bandwith. These are the things i am looking at to make the *big* money down the road. 
I guess i miscommunicated at some point; the malicious entity need not be the intermediary (although they could also be) the most likely attack would be opening a bunch of channels with a hub/ intermediary and then attacking them. So guys like you or me wouldnt be the direct target of the attacks (well we might but ill explain that next) but we will pay for them in fees to the hubs when we use them.
The way we could be attacked is that hubs will also want to leverage the liquidity of their users. so for a guy like you or me who have lets say more-ish money than others they will offer us a discount or even pay us to use our channel liquidity to route additonal capacity through our connections. so now we could lose out.
side note: im with you, i would also nuke the channel balance to make sure the attacker doesnt profit but others are not likely to be as proactive.

True but everything advances much slower (or doesnt happen at all) A really great example is Tesla: Whether they succeed or fail as a company they have kick started the conversion to ev, and possibly solar/battery infrastructure and all that is now going to happen very soon. But none of that would have happened without Teslas ability to borrow/issue debt. 
One of the biggest issues i have with the bitcoin/deflationary arguments (and i support bitcoin) is that everyone only talks about how issuing debt is bad because it encourages government overspending (which is true) but there are like a zillion cases where issuing debt has allowed vast improvements to society.
The core issue here is that debt is not bad but rather the misuse of debt and i havent seen any good arguments discussing this aspect.

you guys are missing the real story: bitcoin has daily trading volume of like 800000-1000000 coins. So this guy is the trustee and has to liquidate the btc to pay everyone but he has to do it for *cash* (not tether or some other altcoin).
What does it tell us then when selling a measley 8000btc for cash crashes the market? This is about as clear cut as it gets that tether is propping up the bitcoin price and there is waaaayyy less fiat demand for bitcoin than everyone thinks.

Yes. The reason miners are still mining is because they *were* making money mining in the past and they hope to in the future. In the meantime they are sitting on a largish investment in specialized mining hardware that is quickly depreciating to the point of uselessness (newer hardware makes the old hardware obsolete as it can no longer compete effectively to mine blocks) so the idea is to mine at a loss until the current hardware stops producing appreciable amounts of coins. If in the future the price jumps back up to $5-6000 then it all worked out.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:20:34
So the issue with companies being their own payment processor is the financial liability that comes with a major attack (think target, etc.) Most companies (even big ones) do not want to handle their own processing. Target did to save money and they totally screwed it up mostly through lack of understanding of the probability of new attack vectors vs the cost to mitigate, and this is with the credit card processing network which is a mature system with a good understanding of how fraud occurs and how to mitigate it. They made a decision to whether through incompetance or just being cheap to ignore certain threats and it came back to bite them in the ass. With LN this is a new totally experimental system: no major company will want the exposure to liability period or at the very least they would only do so if they were able to get an insurance bond to cover the cost of a major attack (which no insurer will underwrite at this point because these concepts are so new that you cannot actuarialize the risks. Tl;DR this is totally unexplored territory.
But because LN bitcoin are disruptive this offers a chance for new businesses to enter the market taking the place of the banks/ credit card processors so the idea is yes you wont want to open a channel with a random entity at first; you will use someone like bitpay. But look what just happened with bitpay and their high fees... Everyone is giving them crap for exorbitant fees but honestly they probably came up with those fees because they are indicative opf the real costs of operating a processing service in this space (with a nice profit on top which honestly they deserve for taking the risk to offer services in this space.) So people will be mad at bitpay or coinbase becaus of ther fees and then a discount intermediary will pop up out of hong kong or something offering fees that are half and people will open channels with that entity because it will work for the most part but with all the reliability issues that come with a company operating in that country.
So each user will have channels open with payment processors; more established ones that charge higher fees and sketchier ones with lower fees but even then the attack can happen through those entities (eg attacker opens many channels with bitpay and sends money itself as described) again bitpay will be able to mitigate the fraud but its going to cost.
End result is no matter what the cost to move money with LN will end up being the same 1-3% (eventually)

No. The whole point of futures is to actually *stabilize* the market. Futures (in any market) came about as a means of hedging against the possibility of future instability (the best common example is the baker needs so many pounds of flour per week and can forecast that throughout the year so he can enter a contract when the price of flour is low to get his future supplies at that low price. At the same time the farmer has a huge crop of wheat coming in and wants to guarantee a price when the market price is higher for his whole crop) In both cases you pay a fee for a set price and in some cases you benefit and in some cases you do not (because the market ends up having a more advantageous price than you contract price) but what you do get is *stability* The baker knows he can forecast that his sale price for bread will be the same for some forward period of time.
So its the same thing for bitcoin. Certain businesses in the cryptocurrency space are simply not viable if the price swings wildly but if they can hedge against this they can proceed to grow. A perfect example of people who woould benefit are the miners themselves. They have to forecast out months or even years ahead to buy the newest versions of mining gear to stay profitable and competitive. But what about the price dropping like it is now. Well if those guys bought futures contracts betting bitcoin is going to drop they can outset capital to preorder gear and understand that if something like this happens and they cant even mine competitively they have the gains from the settled contract to offset the loses incurred by sitting on unused equipment. 
The cool thing is once futures contracts exist for a while they tend to flatten out the big swings in an unstable market (but this can take a minute)
TL;DR if you understand futures and actually care about bitcoin then you want them because it allows bitcoin to grow at a stable steady pace. If you understand futures and you dont give a shit about bitcoin but just want to make $$$ then you either dont like them or really love them but only for a short time when you can take advantage of market manipulation to make bank.
Point is if bitcoin is to ever be a big boy currency then futures are the future.

day traders (and more importantly high frequency trading bots) will actually over time have the effect of stabilizing the price of bitcoin although this will also come as a cost to everyone who is non-professionally trading bitcoin regulary because they will absorb some of those gains.
*note when i say day traders i mean actual semi-professional and professional traders that are coing over from the regular stock market and when i say "High frequency trading bots" i mean actual software that perfroms real arbitrage: working the spread between bid-ask on all the markets faster than we can to make money. which AFAIK arent yet running because of the lack of regulation means thay cannot reliably make money (eg the exchanges can cheat them)

We are talking about a market crash/correction/whatever... not an over inflated currency. Places like India or Venezuala the currency is seen as so bad that bitcoin is actually considered a better option despite its volatility.

if you look at the order book on GDAX there is alot of buy limit orders at 7-8K. it would take  $50M of selling on GDAX alone just to take the price down to 7K.
What it really comes down to is how many retail investors are going to call it a day and sell and if anyone left with bigger money  are going to attempt to create a dead cat bounce.
Either way i can see 8-ish being the bottom although idk how much its going to move from there.

no i wouldnt say that: If anything with bitcoin as long as the ledger is distributed and with proper owner procedures (eg you didnt keep your key in just one place) the bitcoins will be safe.

True but (AFAIK) nobody is using it to actually *buy* stuff... Like this has to happen because the speculation money making phase of cryptocurrency is IMO over.

Bitcoin (and more specifically its implementation of blockchain) is the *only* one mature enough to be considered practically usable at any reasonable scale. Ethereum is nowhere near as mature but offers enough different features to make it worth keeping an eye on (also cryptokitties is actually real use, superficial as it is). Omni is a really great idea in that it leverages bitcoins infrastructure to allow other services to be built on top of it and you can at least trust the maturity of that part but unfortunately omni is mostly used to issue a bunch of crappy coins (and tether).
Literally *every* other coin out there should be considered crap until it can in *any* way prove some sort of real world value proposition.

well people panicked after the order books cleared out. e.g The guy has to sell on a fiat exchange so he puts in the first sell order for 2000btc at 18K and he wipes out all the orders to 18K and probably still doesnt sell all 2000btc so he has to sell some at 17.5. Now if the guy has time he could just sell 200 btc a week and never clobber the price but he doesnt have that luxury; he has a limited timeframe that the court expects this be done.
He could also sell for USDT and the wash trading bots would easily absorb all those orders but the court requires they be liquidated for cash.

Yes and thats fine until you realize that a good portion of how insurance companies make money is by taking the collected premiums and investing them for a return and those investments are bonds and loans which brings us right back to borrowing.
Or we accept that in a deflationary society your insurance premiums are higher by whatever the deflation rate is.

Make no mistake his sale of bitcoin affected the market price whether or not he sold them on the actual markets. He sold the coins OTC to a willing buyer not on the exchange but what if he never sold the coins? Then that buyer would have bought on an exchange instead so removed liquidity by removing inflow of fiat to the exchanges.
Now we can conjecture all we want but the only way we know over time is by watching more large sales of coins for cash but if you look at the data (date of sales vs price) its a pretty strong correlation.

You have the right idea and yes you can play paper investing all you want but things change once your *real* money is invested and you see how your own psychology changes. 
The only thing i would caution about is that dollar cost averaging works great for both bull and bear markets but it does not work well if you are coming off the tail end of a speculative bubble. Look at the Cisco chart for example: (click on max)
If you bought Cisco in March of 2000 and dollar cost averaged over the next year you still havent recovered financially because historically we know understand that Cisco was just hugely overvalued. Cisco still made money after that (dividend+ some small growth) but never the gains it made 99-2000. 
*side note: since Bitcoin is the future we shouldnt be talking about Dollar cost averaging. We should be talking about Bitcoin cost averaging ;)

yes but there will still need to be lending because the world is chaotic. e.g. big hurricane hits a major city and people need money to survive and then rebuild.

Well i am going to have to disagree with that: we have many many examples throughout history of overconsumption of resources even in societies without *money* much less borrowing. A couple simple examples are 1) easter island 2) UK being completely deforested 3) Myan Civilization collapse attributed directly to deforestation/overexpansion
Overconsumption is a problem with humans (and really all living things) in general. You can get rid of debt and slow this down (basically by creating conditions where more people die, people dont live as long, people do less over longer periods of time) but its not going away.
And yes: good ideas will always get capital (through lending) but with a much higher cost of borrowing money and less incentive to lend far less ideas overall will get the chance.

Actually what i was surprised to see was the exact opposite: a bunch of guys i know that got in on bitcoin early and made money have been selling off their bitcoin and moving to stocks.

I agree with you. None of the contenders are even close and the amount of money being thrown at them is crazy... but that doesnt change the fact that bitcoin itself is being subverted as a result of the speculative bubble so much so that i am afraid that it will not survive in its current form. I do however believe that the underlying infrastructure *will* survive as well as the existing blockchain and become actually *more* decentralized again.

I see it the other way as a huge percentage of people borrowed money to *buy* bitcoin over the past year. (which by the way theres a certain irony in the fact that this thing thats supposed to make debt/borrowing a thing of the past is actually been appreciating due to the fact that so many people borrowed money and bid up the price)

not impossible but probably impractical at least when there is speculatie mania. At some point in the future when bitcoin has a steady rate of deflation and its say 3-5% then there will be loans at some amount above that.

Investors see the crypto markets as a hyper volatile version of the stock market; e.g. the perception is you can make more money in crypto markets but you can also lose bigger because of the lack of regulatory controls.

I saw the same thing happen with GTAT; it was really really sad watching lots of retail investors literally lose their life savings for a company that was about as hyped as the crypto markets.
The truth is one of the main things propping up the price right now is the lack of liquidity to fiat; e.g. alot of crypto rich guys are only crypto rich... if they all tried to start cashing out to fiat the price wouild tank. So instead everyone is pinning their hopes on bitcoin acceptance as currency in the future (LN)... except that the same problem will happen: if Starbucks or Target or whoever starts widely accepting bitcoin and people who are crypto long start spending those coins the merchants will need to trade those coins for fiat anyway (Starbucks coffee suppliers are not likely to want to accept crypto at least at first) So the liquidity crunch still happens but just one transaction down the line. 
The price will not recover until we get a sustained large influx of fiat into the crypto again and that wont happen until retail investors see an ability to transact in bitcoin on any scale thats not what it currently is (tiny) which will happen but the growing pains of getting people transacting in bitcoin is going to cause the price to drop to 1-2K. Thats my entry point.

Bitcoin is a store of value but i wouldnt go so far as to say it's a *great* store of value.

We want it to be more like actual gold which has a totaly variaton of 15% over the past 4 years.

The investors coming in last year were (first) the super high risk takers looking for huge returns followed by the more normal retail investor that felt they were missing the boat. 
The problem is that last years hype was based on the narrative that "its different this time" so bitcoin will continue to some upper bound: $50000 or $100000 or $1000000... Now that we see that it *wasnt* different this time the narrative is now "well bitcoin has crashed like this before but it always recovers and goes to new highs" which so far is true... but... Those recoveries took a *long* time; 3 years to recover from the 2013 ATH of $1100.
If you buy now with the thesis that in another 3 years bitcoin will be $18000 again then thats not a bad proposition but alot can happen in 3 years. Now if institutional investors come into the space then it can grow quickly and much more safely but that means regulation and taxes and all the stuff that crypto enthusiasts are averse to.

Theres two plays by institutional investors:
1) is theres groups that believe bitcoin is here to stay as a global currency and they want to control it. Things like the transacting portion will require some sort of bank/clearing agency not because its technically needed but because there are a large number of businesses that simply will not transact in bitcoin if they cannot offload liabilities like compliance and fraud mitigation/resolution.
2) is the pure speculative play; guys that honestly dont care if bitcoin succeeds or not and also understand that its unstable and volatile and just want to make a play to make money. (think credit default swaps in 2008)
Both are happening and will happen on a much larger scale once theres more regulation, and there will be; its already started.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:31:09
You have to be be careful about dismissing issues just because they are old. This is what happened with meltdown/spectre: The first paper discussing that sort of approach was written in *1995* and the community was discussing it since at least 2014. AFAIK the private chain issue is still an an issue: It does not currently affect us because there is enough competition in areas like mining hardware to keep the pools from consolidating.
I'll be honest: I really do not care if the miners consolidate and bitcoin becomes centralized; Im going to make money (probably more money) if this happens and honestly I see it as an inevitablility. Most people who believe in bitcoin however are very against the idea of centralization (e.g. the new bank is the old bank) and if you dont want centralization of bitcoin you should be very concerned about this issue because it will become a problem down the road.

well to be honest they are all pretty terrible in one way or another but the ones i am watching more closely are media/social coins (e.g. like steem but not necessarily steem). The thesis is that everyone is finally realizing that there is the hidden cost to getting free news and social media and that is either 1) you get ads thrown at you or 2) your data gets sold off. I think since everyone is trading attention on social media the next logical step is to move that trading to a coin.
A good frontrunner example is reddit gold: Imagine how reddit will need to work in 5 years as more normies come over and start using the site. A reddit based altcoin would work very well for this in terms of supporting the site and allowing individual content monetization
