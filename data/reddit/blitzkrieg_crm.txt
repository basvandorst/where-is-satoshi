It says pending but as forementioned, that was over 2 weeks ago. Wish they would answer. Even my emails to their personal ones aren't doing enough.

Hey thanks! One quick question though. When are the cards being shipped?
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:50:47
I can assure you it is not a marketing scheme. I know the coinbase founders and up until yesterday. I've never had a problem with coinbase but I'm just tired of having to wait.

Keep in mind that the data on the site is all placeholder data. We probably won't use Coinbase when it's done.

Signed up yesterday. The site is very nice and I like the card feature. Gives it a nice touch.

I'll look into that as well. I'm just disgusted at their support.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:21:34
 or something similar of the sort
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:48:57
Hey thanks! Will do that.

Well I'm friends with the Coinbase founders, but yes I get what you mean. I'll have to do just that. Never really had a problem security wise with them though. I hope I never do.

His first post was definitely his best one though haha
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:14:32
haha nice! well what do you think of the idea of setting up an escrow service with bitcoins? I started one and its looking very promising

Ya sorry about that guys. If you truly are a newbie, I don't suggest day trading. I do day trading on Bitstamp and hold most of my bitcoins on coinbase... That is until Circle (circle.com) comes out with what they have been building.

It's not so much the Mt. Gox price I'm happy about. I don't use Mt. Gox ฿ it's the fact that it's gone up quite a bit since last Thursday. Other than that, I just like watching Mt. Gox' price fluctuation.

Coming* sorry, a lot of excitement.
