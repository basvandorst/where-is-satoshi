the thing with hard-forks is that they are *not* compatible. There will be two chains, each is within itself consistent. In some sense, it's like the Visa and Mastercard network. They co-exist, merchants/exchanges could accept one or the other or both. But the analogy ends here, since Visa/MC have a common currency, whereas with hard-forks, you essential have a new currency as well.


No they don't. If a handful of miners increases the block limit, and the majority of bitcoin *users* switches too, old Bitcoin will become worthless.

@_date: 2015-06-01 19:49:34
To be fair, I don't know how the blocksize limit is exactly communicated on a technical level. So it might be possible that the old chain would be accepted by the new client if it's the longest chain (since any block of size X &lt; 1MB &lt; 20MB; thus it always fulfills the criteria of the new client). If that's the case, it might actually be preferable to implement another change that makes the old blocks completely unacceptable to the new client. In that case, you would get rid of the backward compatibility, which eliminates the problem that miners stick to the 1MB limit.
I am not exactly sure why you are quoting the second part, because I didn't write that.

If you stop to think about it, block time can NEVER be normally distributed. The time between to blocks cannot be negative.

Those "reasons" are mostly not even consistent.
18.) The amount of energy needed to maintain the Bitcoin complex. He talks about problems with rising energy prices.. But since the difficulty of the mining is dynamic, the price/value for BTC has to be such that it covers hardware + energy (roughly). Otherwise, people would quite mining, difficulty goes down and thus energy requirement goes down.

If you have the data ready, you could try to plot a kernel density estimator for the data and an exponential distribution with lambda=mean(data).
Technically, the distribution of the number of blocks (not time), must be a geometric distribution with p=10^(difficulty). At a stable hashrate, the time then is exponentially distributed.
If I interpret what you say correctly, the manipulation is an "unnatural" change in hashrate (i.e. someone is turning on/off machines to intentionally change the block time). If that is what you want to prove, then you do not need to look at the block time at all. You only need to look at the hash rate, the data is there. The block time only obscures your observations with randomness.

I am not saying I am libertarian. However, the point libertarians are making is not that wealth has no influence, because it certainly does have it. The difference is that people need to hand over their power at the point of a gun, while wealthy individuals can only get power by voluntary transactions (assuming there is no favors from governments and no fraud). If you don't believe that the government gets its power from guns, try to not pay taxes, wait for what happens. If you need to pay a fine, wait for what happens. The ultimate result is always physical force.
I am not saying that Bitcoin will solve these problems. I am just pointing out that power from wealth has a very different nature than power from politics.

Assuming people are not infinitely impatient, there is no disadvantage in a low level of deflation since people still need food, shelter etc.
With "find out" I mean "let the BitCoin experiment continue".
In fact, inflation is on the side of wealthy people who have the means to invest in assets that do not suffer from inflation. Lower class and lower middle class people suffer the most from inflation as wages are the last prices that get adjusted to inflation and any savings they have has to be kept in cash/a savings account and thus suffers from inflation. (Unless you want to tell me that if all you have is, say, $5000 in savings you would invest them in equity/stocks.. probably not)

It does not apply to most of the people here on reddit, since most of you are in the US anyway.
But here in Europe (and in other countries), we have either no access to certain online services, or only reduced access (iTunes store, kindle store, etc).

I have thought of that, but I still think that my solution could have an advantage that might be the deciding factor: it's a lot easier to send a text or an email from any device (i.e. you could ask a friend or even a stranger).
With a backup, you first need to access your backup which might take you a few hours to access. Even with a brain wallet you need some software (if I am not mistaken), plus it takes time.
The point would be to have an equivalent service to canceling your credit cards. In case your phone is stolen you certainly do not want to spend a lot of time securing your money, but rather be sure it's save after a text or an email (or maybe even a call).
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:15:08
Obviously, the details need a lot of consideration (as the current tax system does). An example to resolve the issue would be to make it similar to the VAT system currently in place. E.g. you could say that for items below $1000, by default, you do not pay it. For more expensive items, you do (taking into account the fact that it is not worth the effort to go to court for inexpensive items) However, you always have the option to decide otherwise. Sure, I have no prove that it works, but neither do you that it does not. Telling me that any other system would be *so complex* is just fucking ridiculous given the complexity of (and confusion about) the current tax system.
edit: it is also worth pointing out that, at this point, it's not worth designing a system that replaces taxes. There is a hoard of other things that need to be addressed first. In so far, I agree with your comment here:

The thing is, if we had voluntary payments in one form or another, we would not pay as much as we do now, because the value we gain from the government is *less* than the payments we make. So cutting back *is* necessary.
One example to fund the court system would be to attach a voluntary fee to contracts as a percentage of their value. If you do, you get legal protection for the contract you agreed to. That way, it would work much like an insurance, but would be WAY less than, say, VAT. Plus, you can always just not take it.

Though I am not an expert, I cannot think of a reason why it should not work without the Euro (in fact, I think free movement of people and goods is older than the Euro). Going back to the country's previous currency does not solve any problems: all debt is currently in denominated in Euro and remains this way. If there is too much debt, you can devalue your currency relative to others. However, this only works if the debt is denominated in your own currency.

The ATMs I used in the US had withdrawal limits between $800 and $1200. The reason I know this is not because I am rich, no. Withdrawing the maximum amount at the ATM with my European debit card + depositing that amount on my US account at the same ATM was, sadly, the cheapest and fastest ways to transfer money between the US and the EU.
(The reason it is good to withdraw the maximum amount is a fixed fee for each withdrawal on top of a percentage fee).
No, Bitcoin is not that much more complicated.

While this could potentially be a problem, the issue is one that will resolve itself. Either it works or it does not. Either people are willing to live with it or they are not. Bitcoin is, at this point, voluntary (and I think it should stay this way). If your judgment tells you that the damage from other people's benefits outweighs your benefit from using it, then don't use Bitcoin.
Again, there is no real difference between most stocks and Bitcoin in this aspect. You can buy Bitcoin now, but a gain in value is far from certain. If you buy stocks, you still benefit from *other people's work*.
On the contrary, I find it hard to argue that anybody has the power to control the money supply of an entire nation. By what right? To whose benefit? By what standards do they judge? With "voluntary currencies", the only standard you have to concern yourself with is your own. Now, the argument against fiat is not necessarily an argument *for* Bitcoin. But I believe Bitcoin is potentially a step forward.

I once had to cancel tickets. Technically, that's not possible, but if you know you are not going to take the flight, you are entitled to get fees and taxes reimbursed (which are 50%+ of the price). You have to call the incredibly expensive hotline + €20 fee to get the money that does not legally belong to them. Makes no sense to get it back when taxes are like €25-30. So they don't have to pay the taxes to the government and they won't reimburse you so they just get to keep them. Fucktards.

It's becoming more and more essential that people can make partial payments with Bitcoin when they pay online. Even if you tip $5, that does not mean that person actually benefits from it (who knows, maybe the apps they want cost more than $5?). However, if you could use Bitcoin like a coupon and get a discount, that would be perfect for the time being. That would actually hook a lot of people on Bitcoin.

That you can lend $90 is the mathematical limit, but in practice, you need to keep (say) 10%, then you can only lend out $9. If someone deposits this you can lend out $8.1 etc. so the limit is sum (i=0 to infinity) over 0.9^i * 10 = 100. Do I misinterpret something here?

Bitcoin is *not* *truly* deflationary. New coins are added to the "pool" of existing coins every few minutes (this *inflates* the supply). The only reason that Bitcoin might be "really" deflationary is that some coins may become unaccessible. It is not more deflationary than gold. Both Bitcoin and Gold are deflationary in the sense that we anticipate the adoption (adoption of usage, later also population growth with a high level of adoption) and economic growth to be *at some point* larger than the inflation of their supply.

It *might* go up. It basically follows from the fisher equation, i.e. MV=TP
M=Money supply (predetermined with bitcoin)
V=velocity of circulation (how often a monetary unit changes hands in a given time frame)
To explain V, say there is only one company and you. you work for the company, they give you a wage of $1 and they produce food with your labor.  You then buy food again (for $1) with the wage your earned from the same company. Say this cycle happens 100 times during a given time period, and you assume there were only $10 in the whole economy, you say that there then V=2*100/10=20. In other words, the whole money supply has circulated in the economy 20 times. Of course, this is an extreme simplification, but you get the point.
P=price level of goods (but you can also think about it as the inverse price level of bitcoin, assuming the price level of the dollar is constant)
T=number of transactions
Basically, both sides describe how much money is spent in a given time frame, and they have to be equal.
Mass adoption means that more people use the bitcoin, so that would imply an increase in T. His point is that with mass adoption, T grows faster than M, which is probably true. If you only considered P in the equation, that means that bitcoin most become more expensive (or P, the price of goods, falls). However, V can also increase, holding P constant, satisfying the equation.
TL;DR If mass adoption happens, the price of bitcoin does not have to go, if the bitcoin are just exchanged more often.

Miners get transaction fees + the block reward. so over the years, the block reward and transaction fees kind of have to even out or smooth the decline. Presumably, if Bitcoin is still around at this point (I think that's 25 years from now), the value must be much much higher than it is now. So you would not need 25 BTC of transaction fees every block to make it worth it.
In any case, it's just speculation. Nobody knows what will happen to and with Bitcoin in more than 20 decades from now. For that, Bitcoin is just too young.

I cannot guarantee correct punctuation (especially with those weird sentence structures he builds), since I am not a native speaker. There you go:
Today we are seeing a huge change in payment technology, whether it’s digital, convergence or cryptocurrencies. There is a huge opportunity in Asia, and so it is very important for us to look and understand what are the real benefit that are being put into the system by these new technologies. If you are a consumer or a merchant, a government, even a financial services provider–what’s really critical, is that what are you putting into the market place, is solving a need for a customer and is trusted. Trust and security, a stable form of value, are incredibly critical, if you are going to be able to get acceptance for the services that you are looking to provide. The challenge with cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, is that they’re unstable in terms of their intrinsic value. They don’t offer, perhaps, the recourse that consumers are naturally expecting that come from using cash in their day-to-day. And they’re also there to serve a purpose that’s not necessarily completely clear. Let me give you an example: Bitcoin, and a lot of the concerns related to Bitcoin, are, because they are looking to guarantee anonymity, essentially, electronic cash, if you will. And what MasterCard is critically looking at, is “how can we move to this world beyond cash? how do we actually use electronic payments to combat and try, or, [correcting himself] combat the inefficiencies of cash and really create a much more transparent and inclusive financial system. If you really want to do that, it’s quite hard to understand what the appeal is of a cryptocurrency, when that currency is really essentially electronifying cash, it seems to be pretty inefficient. Innovation in payments and, frankly, any industry, is critically important to maintaining a healthy competitive environment and driving improvement and experiences for consumers and business. Innovation is something critically important to what MC does, and Mastercard is particularly focused on ensuring that we are delivery safe, simple, smart solutions to consumers. When we look at the markets across the world, 85% of the world’s reach-out transactions are cash. So what we are trying to ensure, is that we are building compelling, interesting, secure and convenient payment solution that encourage merchants, consumers, governments, and other participants in the financial system, to move and adopt electronic payments. With a big increase in internet traffic, convergence with mobile and everything digital, there is huge interest in cryptocurrencies and what, perhaps, they could create in the market place. Now, we at MC are not completely [ahm] comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies, largely, because they go against the whole principle that we have establish our business on, which is really moving to a world beyond cash and ensuring greater transparency and security and simplicity in the way people live their lives. If you think about it, cash is a problem for a number of countries. Cash really facilities anonymity, it facilitates illegal activity, it facilitates tax avoidance, and a range of other things that aren’t going to drive an efficiency in an economy. Trust is a critical component of any payment system. So if you think about the idea that, all of a sudden, you are having cryptocurrencies being manufactured, if you like, on an anonymous computer, in an anonymous location, it’s completely legitimate to have some concerns about how they might be working. What a regulator wants to do, is ensure that there is a fully compliant, I guess, root to the transaction. That they understand who is making the transaction, who the payment is made to, and that they have a suitable record, so they can ensure that there is prudential control over the system. If it’s an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction. Why does somebody need to be anonymous? I certainly don’t want anybody mining technology, or mining financial away from my control. Particularly, if they represent something for me.

I don't know about the legal implications, but I guess you could always swap a "2014 BTC" for a "2009 BTC" (I am being very loose with my terminology here). That, in turn, would actually mean that "different" BTC (but same amount) could have different prices (making older BTC more valuable).

You have to keep in mind that the network does NOT scale proportionally. Just because you double the number of transactions does not double the amount of energy consumed! Theoretically, you can have the same amount of energy consumed for almost any number of transactions.
This is actually the genius part of the Bitcoin protocol. If the cost of energy consumed by the Bitcoin network gets "too much", mining becomes less profitable and people pull away their computing power from the network, which reduces the overall energy consumed. So in a sense, the Bitcoin network cannot be inefficient, almost by definition.

This does not solve the main problem: large blocks take longer to propagate. Thus miners have little incentive to actually "fill up" blocks with as many transactions as possible, since there is a chance another, smaller block gets propagated faster.
Edit: This will only change when transaction fees make up a significant portion of miner's revenue.

(1) Cars have not been easy to use from the start. (2) I did not live when cars first came up, but I am sure there were nay-sayers asking why you would need a complicated machine called automobile when you can do the same tasks using a horse. I am pretty sure cars were, at first, unreliable, ugly, and hard to use. Plus, you need stuff that is hard to extract (crude oil) and process it. I am convinced that this was incomprehensible to a farmer, who could grow everything he needed for his horses in front of his door.
This is not a case for Bitcoin. This is a case for selection bias. More often than not, things that used to be complicated became gradually easier to use over time. So were cars. So might Bitcoin.

Great advice. The implicit assumption is always that the currency you are using does not lose too much value, though.
Btw, 2% inflation means a less of 2% decrease in your wealth (it's rather 1-1/1.02 = 1.96%). It's a small difference in the shortrun (1 year), but in the longrun it makes a difference (35 years = 100% inflation but 50% decrease in wealth).

I once ordered pizza online from a site I consider trustworthy (the site allows you to order from different restaurants). I accidentally ordered 15 minutes before the restaurant was closing (thus, clearly, no pizza), paid with BTC. In my opinion it's clearly the fault of the website that should not allow this (they don't allow you to order if the restaurant is actually closed, but they allow it 5 minutes before closing). Long story short, I probably could have get it refunded but it wouldn't have been in BTC. So in the end I would have needed to give them banking details which I did not want.

You show that someone gives you a key to a padlock to get the bitcoin. That's not wrong per-se, but it's not how it should be done and it's not how people use it (usually, no one gives you their private key but they'll transfer the bitcoin).
I think a better analogy would be transparent postboxes. Anyone can send you stuff (i.e. bitcoin), when you tell them "my postbox is postbox number 23", everybody knows what's inside (since it's a transparent postbox), but only you have the key to that postbox.

I think this is an important question, an the answer is not easy.
Personally, I believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate libertarian experiment. The benefit is that there is no one you need to ask to innovate. No one is forced to use it. If you want to use it, you can, if you don't you don't. As easy as that. It's completely privatized in a way. If libertarian ideologies are worth anything, the benefits will show over time.
Of course, there will be many obstacles (governments, in particular), but these are my thoughts, in a nutshell.
Disclaimer: I do not call myself a libertarian, I just like it when ideas get tested against reality.

As the government, you could ban unregistered addresses. Good luck with that. Even if you take all US users, they only constitute a fraction of all Bitcoin users.

No, VAT is not an EU-level issue, but country-level. That means each country decides how and to what percentage VAT is applied. In Austria, for example, they have concluded that current law does not require VAT on bitcoins. As far as I remember, Germany said there needs to be VAT (though I don't remember under which exact circumstances). Maybe it is still undecided and that's why coinbase cannot offer bitcoins in Germany.

Do you even read what *you* write? It doesn't matter that he bought them in 2012.

On the one hand, you want to have "enough", so that you actually benefit if mainstream adoption happens. On the other hand, you cannot be certain *if* it happens, so you should not go beyond what you can afford to lose. This might be a lot compared to your net worth, if you are young and you have high earning potentials. This might be a lot less than 1-5%, if you are close to retirement.
Gold is a $7 trillion dollar market, even with mainstream adoption, it is not necessary. That's 2000x the current market cap. A $1000 "investment" (or rather, bet), would net you 2 million dollar. I would say the chance of that happening is far less than 1 in a million, so you can safely assume the expected return to be negative. However, in that case, 10-20 bitcoin would be more than enough to get you a nice nest egg.

Well, it makes sense in terms of investing and purchasing power. Let's take purchasing power. If you have $10,000 worth of bitcoins, at least at this point, you do not care how many bitcoins you actually have. With a price of $1000, you have 10 BTC, with a price of $10, you have 1000 BTC. Now, if the price drops from $1000 to $100, you have to pay 10 times the amount of bitcoins to get the same product as before. The same is true if it drops for $10 to $1.
On the other hand, could you give me an example where I would care that the price of one bitcoin changed by $10, independent of whether the price was $1000 or $100? I cannot think of a situation where this is relevant at all.

There are set rules, which have to be followed (the standard Bitcoin protocol, the US constiution). The rules were *not* formed by a democratic decision process, but by individuals who made an effort to design a working system. Democracy and the mining process are only ways to *secure* the system, not to form it per se. Only because of the democratic aspect of the US (back in the day) and Bitcoin can you be reasonably sure that the rules won't change because of someone's whims.

Ireland has the Euro. AFAIK you have a 0 fee sending money to BitStamp with a SEPA transfer. The only fee you have is max. 0.5% commission (decreases with volume). The last time I withdrew Bitcoin I did not pay anything for the withdrawal. I really don't see where you should have fees eating up your profit.

The change addresses are an automated feature in most clients to more or less "hide" how much you are spending–however, in most instances you can easily guess how much the person is spending. I am not aware of any desktop client that lets you choose different address manually for the same transaction (even though it's technically possible).

I see your points. Liquidity, volume, resistances at price levels etc. are very important. However, I fail to see how a linear chart would be *more* appropriate. In fact, no price chart will ever represent this. I would appreciate if you could point out in which aspect a linear chart depicts the price more accurately. It cannot be the "effort" you mentioned, because this "effort" is not a linear function of the price either.
Moreover, the "upper boundary" cannot be seen in the linear chart either. There is definitely a cap to the price of bitcoin. It's determined by factors other than the price. One definitely has to point out that there will not be an endless trend line (i.e. moon).
I get your points, I really do. There are some real elements that are essential to Bitcoin's development that are not in the log-chart–neither are they in the linear chart.

There already is the notion of pruned nodes. They are supposed to only store unspent output. Regular nodes contain *all* transactions every made. However, once verified, it is not necessary to have all transactions on your hard drive, but only the once that can still be used (i.e. spent). I have not heard of an implementation yet, but I am not really following the development much.

You would need to determine the chance that Alice/Bob/... leaks the key (i.e. someone has access to it) as well has the chance that the key at Alice is inaccessible. You would also need to know whether all keys of Alice etc. get inaccessible/stolen at the same time or separately. Then you can say you want your overall chance of accessing your funds &gt;X% and the likelihood of having your funds stolen &lt;Y%. From here you should be able to define a weight for all 4 candidates.
In the end, it is a trade-off between accessibility and protection against leaks. For the highest accessibility, give one key to all 4.

Chances are that cryptocurrencies use SIGNIFICANTLY less energy than current monetary systems, even if crypto is scaled up to the same level. It is very hard to put an accurate number on it, though.

"When it's promoted" -&gt; you are writing about it as if a company's goal is it to promote bitcoin as an investment. It's not. There is no obligation to "recruit" new people; there is also no way to avoid having new people.

Bitcoin won't have any returns (except maybe another bubble), unless there is an economy (that is, Bitcoin companies).

Maybe someone already wrote that somewhere else. You don't need to actually have the private keys to spend bitcoin on your phone in order to receive bitcoin. It probably sounds a little complicated, but it is definitely one of the safest options. Let me explain:
You can set up a wallet on your computer at home. There you can generate several (10-20, however many you need, one for every client) Bitcoin addresses. You can send and receive payments and generate addresses on your computer. You can then put the addresses into your phone as "watch addresses". That is, you can see if bitcoin are received or sent, but you cannot actually send them, because the private key that is needed is on your computer at home. Actually, anyone who knows your Bitcoin addresses can see your bitcoin balance, that's why it is good to use a new one for every transaction! When you have a new client who wants to pay with bitcoin, you can just give him a new Bitcoin address and the check if you have received the payment. Even if someone were to steal your phone, your bitcoin are perfectly safe.

Technically, the Bitcoin network should be able to handle a trustless lottery. The conditions for claiming bitcoin are pretty flexible. So everyone partaking in the lottery has to send their bitcoin to address X with their lottery numbers attached and the condition that any private key of an address can claim the bitcoin as long as the lottery numbers are correct (and, of course, with the condition that the other participants used the same conditions). 
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:42:09


That's like saying you have to hand them the private key to verify that the bitcoin are yours, but they don't keep the keys. Truth is, it does not matter whether they keep it or not. As soon as you hand over your private keys (here: credit card number), security is breached, period.
