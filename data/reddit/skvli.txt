Can you post a screenshot? It's not that I don't trust you, it's just that you're a stranger on the internet haha.

So do the fees just go up with the value of BTC? I mean, I've done transfers before (with around the same amount of BTC I have now) for like $2-$5 before the Crazy Climb that we saw in the last few months.
20% seems pretty ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:31:13
Is that a setting in Electrum i can switch to?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:12:24
Oh, I know Electrum does support this since 3.0, I believe. I think they're on 3.0.5 currently.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:04
Yeah, becauce it's only showing 2 decimal points. Which is rounded down to 0. But when you type it in and search fully, you see the full results. This isn't hard haha.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:01
You'll be fine in like 2 months.

It says 1 of 2 and then 950 BTC. 950 Bitcoin as of right this second is worth about $4,228,849. So OP is pretty stoked about this find.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:30:36
So should I transfer all my BTC from my default wallet to a new wallet in Electrum for this to happen, or just sit tight?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:39:38
Yeah, my main concern was that I thought I'd be looking at it, but I'm not. I'm planning on waiting a few days for sure before trading anything. I was just concerned that I didn't see it yet. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:44:50
No problem.  The thing is, it might just be an old drive, and there's nothing of value at all on it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:49:05
If I send my bitcoin (that has been in an electrum wallet since before the fork) to Bittrex, will it automatically split off the portion of Bitcoin Cash for me? I still am not fully grasping the BCH situation as I was new to bitcoin only a month or so before the fork. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:14:50
I know this sub is going to have 10000000000 posts today, but the way I understood the fork, was that I'd wake up and see my BTC, as as well as BCC in my Electrum Wallet. I only see my BTC. Has it not hit yet? I'm not even mad if the BCC doesn't show up, I'm more just curious now, because I'm really new to all of this. If you're going to be snarky, it's easy to not comment at all haha. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:55:58
Wait, isn't that 13.8 million USD though? Or do I have a [bad converter?](
I assume I must be wrong, because why anyone would keep a 13.8 million dollar souvenir is beyond me, lol.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:53:21


LOL DAMN, YOU GOT ME GOOD
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:44:36
I got in at 2700, and again when it fell to 4300 after hitting 5000. Even with that I'm at 134% profit and I've only been in since mid June. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:39:44
Ah, thanks for clearing it up. At least I had the number right, just connected to the wrong thing. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:14:11
How can I install this if I already have Electrum installed on my computer? Do I uninstall my current version first? I don't want to inadvertently lose my BTC! I don't know how the wallets really work, I just know that they do! haha.

Initial Question: Hi, I was wondering if there are any plans for Amazon to accept Bitcoin as payment in the future?

I don't get how this works. Wouldn't you have to pay capital gains tax on every transaction? Doesn't that defeat the purpose? I was looking into this with the Shift Card, and asked them about it. They just told me they couldn't advise me about any capital gains taxes. That's not an answer! haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:48:07
Never too late. I think there is a cap of like a potential $21,000,000 per coin. There's still a long way to go. I only have like .195 BTC, but it's still a fun ride!
EDIT: I'm an idiot. Read comment below.
EDIT II: Parent comment deleted haha.
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:39:26
Yeah you could print it on a business card along with the QR for your wallet haha.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:15:39
Cool, thanks. Patiently HODLing over here. Haha.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:14:19
But GDAX has it's own site. Is this a thing where Coinbase basically has a skin over GDAX so that way they can charge higher fees?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:24:56
Thanks! So it should be integrated the same as segwit? Just need the wallets and exchanges to adopt the tech?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:57:46
So GDAX itself isn't necessarily for the casual bitcoin buyer?
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:52:32
Had a friend promise the same thing, except with scissors. He said he'd cut is dick off with scissors if the Bills beat the pats last year, even without Brady. He promised...
He didn't deliver.

(USA) My office's computers were attacked (just locked out basically) and demanded ransom in bitcoin. The FBI couldn't do much and suggested we pay up. Our IT guy (Part Owner) did research and invested his own money to pay the ransom, back when it was like $700.  IT problem solved, he saw the potential for BTC, and now is up 400% of his additional investment.  He told me about it, and I invested very little in June at around $2700 and invested some more when it crashed from $5k to $4300.  I'm about 60% in the positive as it stands now. Pretty wild ride.
EDIT: Formatting.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:27:57
I have no idea how to do any of what you just said haha.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:24:34
Is the Lightning Network going to be integrated into BTC, or is it going to be another hard forked coin?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:33:30
That's great considering you could potentially make your rent some months by simply hodling if you play your cards right haha.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:24:33
I second this question.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:23:05
But if it stays in BTC, I only pay the taxes when i take it out to USD, right?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:23:27
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:52:59
Yes, selling the BTC to USD and putting into my bank account.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:23:31
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:55:11
Ok cool, I did put my BTC into an Electrum wallet.
EDIT: Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:10:08
Thanks. I think I'm set. I appreciate your help on this.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:02:58
I'm not the original question asker here, but I have my BTC in an Electrum wallet. You're saying I should move it to a new Electrum wallet, and then the BCC will show up in my "old" (current) wallet tomorrow? If I don't move the BTC to a new wallet today, it may cause a problem?
EDIT: I'm new to investing in Bitcoin, so I'm trying to figure this out.
EDIT 2: Sorry, I reread your comment, and this is saying to move the BTC to a new wallet after the fork takes place (I think). So, effectively, I should wake up tomorrow morning and see BCC as well as BTC in my one Electrum wallet, and then I should move the BTC to a new Wallet in Electrum. I think I got this now haha.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:56:12
I've searched, but it's all ELI5's for specific parts of the situation, not the whole situation in general. As I barely understand any of it, I'm trying to sift through the noise. I also may just suck at searching haha.
