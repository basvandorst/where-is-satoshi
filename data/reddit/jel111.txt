Every fork is more Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and the countless others. The fact that each is not worth as much doesn’t matter it is still making more Bitcoin. Thus 21 million is a fallacy.

I see where you are coming from but the fact that you can create more coins that have value, any value actually proves my point. Doesn’t matter if it’s one to one or ten to one. You are still creating more money. Exactly what Fiat does which causes inflation. If Bitcoin was not only a set 21 million but also a set value then that would be true. But the fact that another coin that is created can affect other coins actual value by decreasing its demand or price is inflation.

Call it shitty all you want people still put value/money there that would prolly have gone to Bitcoin .

My point is the thing that everybody talks about is there is no inflation in Bitcoin because of only 21 mil coins. One it’s software and can be changed if core so decided and Two when another coin is created and people give it value that is just like making more Fiat. So the 21 mil argument is futile.

There is a guiding force. They are the developers that work on Bitcoin Core. It’s code and can be changed. If we look at history it tells us that the limit of 21 mill will be changed. Who would have believed paper money would be a thing a few hundred years ago? We have no way of knowing what people or more importantly Bitcoin Core will believe in 20 years. I will say that the easy thing to do is just Hard Fork, like we do now and just let Bitcoin be. I believe way to much emphasis is put on the 21 mill fallacy.

But doesn’t just the creation of Bitcoin itself infer a vision? Would he have taken the time to create Bitcoin if he didn’t believe what the Cypherpunks believed? Some believe that he or they were part of that crowd. I don’t know obviously but it would make sense.

Maybe not CryptoKitties but I’m positive by looking into letters and posts written by CypherPunks that there vision was a world currency. A p2p currency and not regulated. That is a vision all it’s own. There is a vision and ideology behind it. Anarchists and Libertarians.

I’m talking about the history of money not Bitcoin itself. How what we think changes over time about the way we control money. Look at the evolution of paper money and how it came to be. I bet most people thought it was a bad idea and yet that’s what we got. When money and power is involved shit goes sideways and not for the good of the many. 
Almost everyday someone is trying to add to the 21 mill. Every shitcoin is someone trying to make more bitcoin.

One more thing I would like to add to this interesting conversation is that the reader I think Bitcoin stayed alive was because there is a vision attached to it. Like it or not, besides last November/December, an ideology or vision is why most are attracted to it.

Actually similar to PayPal but a big part was where they allow people who normally are not allowed into the banking system or have enough money to set up an account to link there pay and collect interest on it. Not the same as PayPal. Similar to Bitcoin in the aspect of allowing the unbanked to be able to use dagital transactions.

We talk and talk of Bitcoin being for the unbanked and how much better it will be. Isn't a system like this actually better? You haven't the volatility or the terrible user experience. You do not have the worry of sending.
