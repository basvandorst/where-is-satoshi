LocalBitcoin is like shit in crypto, if it's no the volume no one would be using it. There is good alternative out there better than LB, their main problem is lack of liquidity AKA offers. Like **PayFair ( for example, it's a perfect P2P Crypto / fiat exchange. They even made a telegram BOT to make such deals / trades / exchanges &amp; even lower FEEs than this shit caleld LB. LB my ass, it's time to find better alternatives out there. I would recommend Payfair since i used it myself, so smooth &amp; easy to deal with, even better than LocalEthereum.

With all do respect, but not even close to PayFair man, just go check [PayFair]( &amp; tell that Dether is better lol. The only minus for PFR i not been listed on a decent exchange, that's all. Other than that it's the perfect P2P crypto Exchange IMO. I used it myself &amp; i can confirm how wmoth it is, especially that Telegram BOT which makes it even faster without the need to go through the platform (website).
This &amp; without telling you about the Trust Nodes &amp; how can you earn from the volume in the whole platform, you can even be an Escrow Node earning from solving disputes, how about that man, Dether isn't even close to PayFair, that's a sure thing.

The most real fact about internet is that no matter how strong the governments are (or my become) will never be able to limit the existence of an inner society there able to create something that will never be controlled by those censor whales. Bitcoin was the first official money for that society, now followed by dozen of other cryptos, so this has no limit &amp; will never be controlled. Staying dark is a matter of life against those government &amp; especially that big lie about Banks. Now 1 Bitcoin is more valuable than Gold, how about that as a fact :)
