Banks can't loan bitcoins. Banks can't freeze bitcoin accounts.

When USD is used to buy illegal things or gets stolen why don't we ban it like the senator from West Virginia wants to ban Bitcoin?

About 3 years ago i was traveling from Louisiana to Arkansas to buy a Cadillac with way over 10k in cash everything went smooth but i sure was paranoid having that much cash sitting in the glove box during the trip. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:15:40
Maybe the bankers need to read this.. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:32:31
While no coins will be given fees will still be given. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:36:42
The fee values will be about the same as the value of a coin. They wont get coins anymore just the fees. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:40:43

Matthew 6:3 
So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.

@_date: 2014-02-25 03:47:57
Only if that person starts selling the coins and thus driving down demand,Hell he might buy all the coins from the FBI then 10 million worth on the exchange increasing the price. Who knows. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:58:36
I'm sure it has to do with some type of money or kickback.

Need a simple debit type Card that you call an 800 number aka the exchange buy bitcoins and it auto converts bitcoins to USD when swiped.it would also need to covert USD to bitcoin when you buy more coins. This applys to non tech people or someone that's too lazy to read.

I've been a member of for a little over a week now never used bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency before. I joined because I seen alot of people talking about it over on the and hearing about the charitable contributions.  I'm a person that invest in more traditional routes like stocks/bonds/land and silver and just thought hey why not spend a few hundred bucks and buy some dogecoin have some fun and hope it reaches $1.00. I've been having fun but still believe it's just that fun. From what I've seen bitcoin is more serious investor type currency and believe some discipline over at  wouldn't hurt anything. Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:29:26
If demand is high and supply is low the price will rise. Unless of course demand plummets and it nosedives. Edit. people will be paid coin fees.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:08:05
wow thanks you popped my bitcoin cherry. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:23:04

When people steal bitcoins they want that person in jail. Just like when banks give shotty loans and destroy the worlds largest ecomony they want the bankers to go to jail. In reality no one goes to jail

Could the company send the amount to collection if non payment is received? Would it affect the credit of the person? Would we measure the value in bitcoin or USD like $500 credit limit or 1 bitcoin credit limit?
