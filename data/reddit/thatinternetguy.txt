Not going to debate on semantics, but Satoshi once wrote this in his paper:
*Verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.*
Dropping to 6,000 full nodes in two years is very alarming. It may become quite feasible to trick SPV nodes into accepting fake transactions.

Comparing Bitcoin full node to SMTP server is quite silly especially when he knows fully well that Bitcoin and SMTP sit on the opposite spectrum of things. SMTP has to be centralized to work. Each employee can't have their own SMTP server for their email even if they want to. SMTP doesn't need consensus to be secure. It doesn't need consensus to accept or reject emails. Bitcoin on the other hand works the opposite way. It relies completely on the consensus of full nodes (clients and miners). The greater number of these full nodes, the more attack proof of Bitcoin network is. 6K is probably not alarming yet but the trend is quite alarming. If the number has hit the bottom, okay fine, but if this continues at this rate, Bitcoin will be dictated by a small group of full nodes. Your transactions will be valid or rejected not because Bitcoin standard says so but because they say so.
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:20:40


Debating on the semantics won't get anyone anywhere. All email clients of a domain (or many domains) depends entirely on a centralized authoritative SMTP server to send and deliver emails. Your ISP's SMTP server provided to you is just a relay SMTP server, acting like a proxy server, nothing more to it.
Bitcoin is consensus based. Transaction is valid because majority of full nodes accept it. A block is valid also because majority of full nodes accept it. SPV nodes have no say over these and they ask the consensus of full nodes if anything is valid or not. It's not going to be pretty when majority of full nodes belong to attackers, or that your internet connection is controlled by the attacker. 
Bitcoin is not comparable to SMTP. It's stupid to compare to SMTP, because there's nothing alike, so stop comparing it, period.

Bitpay or Mtgox merchant APIs will instantly sell the Bitcoins once a transaction is made (but there's also an option to keep some or all the coins). That in practice will not expose sellers to price fluctuations. They don't even need to wait for confirmations to do that either.

You could do that but the newly installed Bitcoin client will need to rescan the blockchain and sync up all the wallet transactions, and this is going to take hours. I'm not too sure if the Bitcoin client automatically does a rescan for you, but in case it doesn't, you will need to run bitcoin-qt.exe with "-rescan" command line.
Alternatively, if you don't need to have the old addresses, and you need access to your coins asap,  you could [import your wallet.dat backup to Blockchain.info]( AND immediately send whole balance to your new local Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin client won't need a blockchain rescan since it's just a new transaction.

When you say something like that, you don't understand Bitcoin. There's a maximum size limit of a block, which is 1MB right now. Bitcoin block averages about 6 blocks per hour, or a maximum 144 MB everyday. That's 53GB a year. If you have 1TB drive, it'd take 10 years to fill a little over half of the capacity. By then, you would have 10TB drive or larger.
What happens when there are more transactions than the network could handle is that the minimum tx fee will rise. In bitcoin, nobody forces you to send a transaction with an *x* fee, but if you send that with fee below the minimum, your transaction will get stuck unconfirmed for days until your transaction priority (calculated from transaction age and fee) gets high enough to be included in a block.
Edit: I forgot to mention pruning. Old transactions whose outputs are all spent could be pruned away. I'll be honest here. I think blockchain should be preserved. Pruning makes sense for database performance reasons but not for storage reasons.

Issue at hand is very real loophole in Bitcoin protocol. I agree that transaction id shouldn't be trusted, and that MtGox has to fix their system that relies on transaction ID, but this security vulnerability allows attackers to freely inject script data into an already signed transaction. This is very absurd from the perspective of cryptographers because a transaction that is already signed must safe guard all its data with the signature. Attack of this nature only gets better in time. 
My proposal is for an easy fix. It is so easy because new Bitcoin clients have to sign all data including the script. Since the signature is written to the script and a signature can't sign itself, just replace the signature with a fixed length of bytes as its placeholder. Sign the whole thing. Problem solved.
It would also watch out for that 'nonce' or 'magic number' field in a transaction. It basically serves no practical purpose at all. Bitcoin clients should require this field to be zero.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:53:48
Bitcoin blockchain you're on now has never hardforked before. It once forked for a few blocks when a few miners enforced new BIP that accept large block size. Problem was urgently solved when those "few" miners reverted their software back to pre-0.8 implementation. If they insisted on new implementation like you do, Bitcoin would have been over.
This time it's very different. You're dealing with seizure of millions of unspent outputs here that are actively mixing up. It can't be done.

What you don't seem to understand are the risks of the mechanism you're describing. It may work with traditional commodities such as gold. Why? There's no MtGox styled scandal in any gold market that you have to be varied of such risks. Now, unless you're new to Bitcoin, you should understand that the Bitcoin exchanges can, do and will held up deposits and withdrawals at their will. This is going to severely undermine the mechanism you think it's going to be used.

If fee keeps going up, at some point, micro transactions could be handled by third parties, think PayPal, where micro transactions are made outside of the Bitcoin permanent blockchain. People would then store most of their Bitcoins in local wallets, and would leave some disposable Bitcoins with the third-party services. Sending Bitcoins within the same third-party network would be instant, low cost and out of the permanent blockchain. This kind of third-party services needs not to be a website, and it could be done in a hybrid decentralized-centralized fashion. They could implement Bitcoin-like P2P system but with a fixed-size, auto-pruning blockchain where one unspent output is mapped to exactly one output. The reason for this hybrid system is to make data backups across the network as a redundancy. 
This is something I might do in the future.

BTC miners produce SHA265 hashes of the block data.
Bitcoin address is a combination of RIPEMD-160 hash of the ECDSA public key, a checksum and an ID number differentiating Bitcoin from other altcoins.
That being said, if you lose the private key to your 256-bit ECDSA public key, it's a done deal. You'd have to run your bruteforce for hundreds of billions of years using all computing power combined. However, if you lost your password to your encrypted wallet and your password is comprised of some words in the dictionary, it would take anywhere from minutes to days to crack it. If your encrypted wallet uses a long, randomly generated password, it's a done deal; you'd have to spend billions of years to recover it.

@_date: 2014-04-16 09:23:41
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:16:31
You're confused.
Bitcoin uses 256-bit ECDSA keys in blockchain transactions. If you're recovering a lost private key, you're going for whole 256-bit.
Bitcoin address is comprised of 8-bit header + RIPEMD-160 hash of SHA-256 hash of the 256-bit ECDSA public key + 32-bit checksum. Displayable Bitcoin address we use is the Base58-encoded string of the binary Bitcoin address. The graphic is not about this, because attacking RIPEMD-160 would be only recovering the 256-bit **public** key, which is useless because we don't know how to find the corresponding ECDSA private key from a public key, yet (integer factorization limitations).
Unrelated, Bitcoin client's wallet.dat file encryption uses symmetric encryption like AES-256 or Blowfish. The graphic is not about this either. Recovering a private key is not recovering an encrypted wallet file.

The mechanism may work on traditional commodities because the exchange/market of such commodities carry an extremely low risk. Bitcoin exchanges come and go like dead flies. I'm not anti Bitcoin here. What i'm saying here is that this EFT thingy could be worse than having the real Bitcoins in the wallet. Once your BTC is in your wallet, the exchange can go away and you still get to keep your coins. BItcoin EFT? Maybe not, because the held dollars and coins are gone with the exchange.

All these people wishing Gox to be dead. Having withdrawn all your BTCs from Gox doesn't mean you're safe. A metric ton of USD were deposited in Gox, and it's still stuck there. Without the USD injected into the other Bitcoin exchanges, you can bet that it's going to take down BTC price on all other exchanges too due to revaluation. You don't get to enjoy same BTC price when a large chunk of USD is expected to get locked up in lawsuits for a long time.
Now if Gox allows withdrawal, you can be darn sure people will withdraw and sell their coins on other exchanges. Since USD is short on other exchanges, what do you expect BTC price to be? Definitely a nosedive, a huge crash because people will realize there's not enough USD for everyone.
There's that. Continue wishing death upon Gox.

Because it's Bitcoin, and bug like this can wipe out them clean in a single attack (or withdrawal).
Banking systems occasionally have similar accounting error too, sometimes [showing billions of dollars]( in the account, but you can't really withdraw anything when it happens, because all banking systems automatically do a quick audit on the balance whenever there's a pending withdrawal.
I joined the development team of a microfinance banking and debt management system. There are automatic audits in place to prevent loss of money against database corruption, injected data, security breach, bugs in code, etc. There will be an alert in case a known transaction is missing from an account, an unapproved transaction is added/injected, or the running balance is not equal to the sum of all transactions. It is a requirement to have 100% data integrity before any money is allowed to get out of the bank. You can't say the same for new Bitcoin systems out there. MtGox is a prime example of the non-existence of independent automatic audits as a security measure to whatever trading infrastructure they had in place. You have got to have separate auditing as well as monitoring systems in place on top of any back office system. It's checks and balances.
Bitcoin management system should be a magnitude harder to develop if you intend for it to work all day everyday without any maintenance time to close the books and do some serious auditing. For banks, there's always a brief period of time that the data must be static long enough to close the books and finish the audits. Maintenance is usually scheduled after midnight.

No, it has never been a truer reflection of the price. BTC got to above $250 is due to a massive injection of Chinese yuans. Problem is yuan is over there in BTCChina, and Bitstamp for instance have only USD in there, so the only support of BTC now is Chinese people's willingness to keep their BTCs. If they don't, it's going to crash hard down to the lowest low.
It doesn't change the fact that USD has always been stuck at MtGox for months now. While they makes up 25% of trades these days, they still hold the largest reserve of USD.

Bitcoin transaction protocol requires each unspent output (your received BTC) is spent in whole. That is, somebody sent you 1 BTC. If you want to spend only 0.2 BTC out of that 1 BTC you had received, you have to send 0.2 BTC to your receiver and then 0.8 BTC changes back to yourself (which will be new addresses every single time if you use the Bitcoin QT client).

Sight... there's nothing wrong with Bitcoin addresses. It's just a hash to allow the owner of private key(s) to claim the coins, a checksum to make sure the entered address is valid and and bits of essential information to tell what kind of the address it is. 
You can't mistype an address thanks to the checksum; invalid addresses are always identified as invalid. You can't mistakenly send Bitcoins to altcoin addresses thanks to the address type flag to tell if the address is supported or not. 
I don't think any stinking name lookups is gonna help anything. It's just too much to risk sending to wrong names. Besides, just use the address book of your favorite Bitcoin client. You don't have to remember shit. Addresses and names are there in the address book.

MtGox wallets may have been emptied from attacks of this nature. Basically, MtGox sent withdrawals twice to the attackers. My speculation is that other exchanges may likely have been hit too.
I implemented Bitcoin protocols in .NET framework, and this attack wasn't supposed to be possible at all. The signature is supposed to be changed when anything has changed, yet the protocol allows attacker to alter the transaction yet keep the signature valid and manage to have the new transactions accepted in the blockchain.
To fix this issue, Bitcoin will have to restrict to only standardized scripts, or they would have to devise a way to sign the whole transaction including the script (with spaces in place of the signature data).
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:10:28

I appreciate your detailed explanation, but yeah Bitcoin addresses are standardized.

The Bitcoin addresses we see (ie. 1MCq8hCbsHNTXqnHosFwtPZRmGcWUynuHD) are just encoded BitcoinBase58 string of the aforementioned binary concatenation.
Now a multisig address is just like the single-sig address above, except it's a hash of three N public keys instead of 1, and the first letter is "3" instead of "1" (that's due to the use of different version header byte).

A M-of-N multi-signature address means that the address is made from N pairs of private/public keys. You will need to use M pairs out of those pairs to send transactions. Says, 2-of-3 multisignature address. You will generate 3 pairs of private/public keys. You send one pair to an online service like Blockchain.info. You keep one pair in Bitcoin-qt on your computer, and the last pair is in your phone. When you want to send Bitcoin through the website, it will ask you to approve or sign on your computer or phone. If the website is compromised, attacker can't steal your Bitcoins, because they would have only one pair. In another scenario, the website shuts down. You can still have access to your Bitcoin by using your computer to send the transaction and then you approve on your phone.
There is no such software yet. It will be very soon.

Bitcoin script is so versatile it extends Bitcoin by supporting different kinds of payment contracts. You could actually send your Bitcoins unsigned allowing anyone in the network to modify and claim your Bitcoins (hence Bitcoin transaction was designed to be malleable). You could also send your Bitcoins to trash by not allowing anyone even you to reclaim.

You don't have to be a business to use Mtgox API. It's just available for everyone (provided that s/he has the "Verified" status).

1. Very small compared to non-derivatives.
2. Good luck asking them to convert your ETF to BTC.
3. You can see Bitcoin being sold at different prices across the world. What makes you think Winkleboss Coin will truly reflect BTC price? and which BTC market exactly?

Okay while I've developed arbitrage calculators numerous times before, I'm going to play along here. What are you trying to arb your Winklevoss ETF against here? Winkdex price? how the heck are you going to do that?  This isn't like gold EFT, sweetie.

Satoshi would be rolling in his grave if he knew where his beloved decentralized currency would depend on centralized finance system. It's probably a reason he didn't sell his million bitcoins frozen in the aging chain.

Trojans and keyboard loggers all can defeat any encryptions you have. Basically, these programs have the same access you have, because all your passwords logged and are known to them.

Unless you live in a cave country, you have to obey the a court issued warrant. So yes, police in your country gun will point a gun to your head too if you resist.

Pretty useless for most cases because people use same password for everything. Even you use different passwords, if you got your one of your account hacked, chance is your computer got infected with a program that forwards all saved passwords in Chrome and Firefox to its creator. It's straight forward. The passwords are inside Sqlite database files, readily decryptable by a program that runs on your computer.

Standard bitcoin scripts are either pay-to-address or pay-to-public-key. Clients will accept non-standard scripts but will not forward to other clients. Miners however will include transactions with non-standard but valid scripts. The transaction mentioned has valid scripts albeit non-standard.
The transaction appeared to inject arbitrary data into block chain. It could be anything from smaller pic, to link and text message.

Goes to show that you need to note down all the keys as soon as you scan the barcode. Just make sure you don't save the note to email or your computer (as that would defeat the very purpose of two-factor auth), or put the physical copy near the computer that other people have access to.

It's not MtGox's fault for someone who got your password (likely through a malware keylogger or form grabber). It is your own fault for not using Two-factor Authentication. It takes only 1 second to steal all saved passwords in Firefox and Chrome and forward it to the hacker. If you need proof, just search for Chrome/Firefox passwords recovery software and you'll see plenty. These passwords are stored in SQLite databases with really weak encryption.
Chance is if your PC got compromised, all your addresses, phones and email addresses have probably been harvested from Firefox/Chrome database too. These data are not encrypted in any way. It takes only a millisecond to get all these data.
Right now, you need to change the passwords on all the websites on another computer. It's that serious. 
Enable two-factor auth on login, settings and withdrawal. Bitstamp, BTC-e and MtGox have all that for FREE. Pair it with Google Authenticator on your phone.
After that, immediately check the API settings of your MtGox/BTC-E/Bitstamp account. Remove all backdoor APIs access that allowed the hacker to automatically steal from you!!!
You must also enable Two-factor Auth for your email account for secured communication. Gmail has it and it's free too. SMS option is also free.

By your logic, "impossible" should be removed from English language because nothing is impossible.
