I see where you're going with this, but you really can't claim musical superiority/snobbery when you still refer to the music as "EDM".

lol I definitely didn't miss the sarcasm. It just irks me when people claim musical taste superiority yet 'EDM' is an active part of their vocabulary. EDM is a pretty bullshit make believe category that people use when they don't know much about electronic music except that it's made with computers.
It's as if I called rock and roll music GALDM (guitars and live drum music)
or classical as PBOM (performed by orchestra music).
It's really a pretty bullshit label if you think about it.
Electronic music has genres. House, techno, drum and bass, garage etc. 
So calling it 'EDM'....kinda makes it seem like you don't even know much about the music either yanno? 
EDIT: edited because original comment was a bit too asshole-ish without really being warranted. oppz.

No. Point more being don't be condescending to others about something they like if you don't really even know what you're talking about.

If you are going to pull your money out eventually, definitely invest it like Tending says. Too many lottery winners etc. immediately spend large sums when they should be investing and paying off large purchases in increments off of their gained interest.
