A piece of shit who wants control over the lives of others would say something like this. Nevermind all the South Americans and Africans using sound money like Dash in lieu of their failing government currencies. No no, it’s all those racist white kids.

Any government can confiscate or snatch up that gold easy. They do it all the time. Little tougher for them to seize btc...

Conservatives? Nah. Many I know think it’s a scam.

The bottom 2 may be made of silver. The top right may be copper. Top left is probably just painted gold and not worth anything really.
Run a magnet over them. If any of them stick, they’re all essentially worthless. Silver won’t stick, but you should feel a tiny tiny bit of attraction. 
Silver is ~14$ an oz or so right now, so you may have $28 or so worth.

It doesn’t matter. They know what they’re doing. They’re manipulating the markets. Trash crypto to drive the markets and buy a ton when it’s low. When it’s high, claim they’re at a competitive disadvantage and sic congress and regulators after crypto. It’s all a series of dirty games.

Debunked as in, ‘reading a bunch of articles to confirm my own biases because he’s a doo doo head that I don’t like’
This is what makes bitcoin so great.
