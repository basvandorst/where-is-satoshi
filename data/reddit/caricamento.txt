No chargebacks? That seems like it would totally suck for the consumer if the business did something wrong.

Woah, hold it there. Just because the Swedish Royal Bank pays for "administrative expenses associated with the prize and funds the monetary component of the award" you can't just say that the prize is "issued by banks". It is misleading.
The Wikipedia article that you linked to clearly states that "Laureates in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences". That is certainly not a bank.

I most certainly did not claim it was impossible. I suggested it was improbable. Please don't come at me with the same fallacies that you're using against my argument.

Sorry - I should have been more clear. They *recognized* the chargebacks, but not the *mistake*. I'm thinking of one in particular where they mis-shipped/didn't ship/the package never arrived and they couldn't prove that they even sent it, but still insisted that I was wrong and owed them money after the chargeback went through.

Difficulty increases with the potential number of permutations. Relevant XKCD: 
The reason this didn't work for OP is that they used an existing (e.g. sane) rubric.

In my experiences with chargebacks (n=3), the company made the mistake and worse, refused to recognize it. Having the credit card issuer back me up was invaluable in those cases. So yes, if you can get a third party escrow/guarantor I would be much more comfortable paying in bitcoin.

I could almost care less about the freewheeling underpinnings. I mostly want to use the first truly international digital currency!
