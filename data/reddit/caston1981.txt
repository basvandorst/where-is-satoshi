We could see them use it to back the value of a new cryptocurrency that could be used as a reserve currency by the FED. BTW in the past there have been mass confiscation of public Gold. If the US governmen has seized the bitcoin of law abiding people of the world this time and they get away with it who is going to stop them when they start doing this en mass?

You need to call up and claim your account totals. This is where having screenshots and csv files will assist you.
I suspect the line will be in Japanese and (with great diffiulty) English.

MtGox is rising like a Phoenix from the ashes!

He's much easier to understand than Mark as shown in the youtube video that mstevenson10009 posted.

I recognized him from some news articles. I thought great, and straight away put some burning questions to him:
Q1. What is causing the withdrawal delays?
• Well, because Gox is the best known of all the exchanges, we have been under the regulatory spotlight.
• This has created problems with government agencies, and also with our banking partners.
*italics* • There are also some ongoing investigations, which we cannot talk about."

I would really prefer MtGox did a rollback like in 2012. I know people that sold their btc and bought back cheaper will have made a mint but many people just held on. When they halted btc withdrawals they should have also halted trading. The ridiculously low BTC price currently reflects their mistake. They should perform a rollback to the day when btc withdrawals were disabled and open up with no orders in the order books.

If we could appeal to the wider community for donations towards the payouts that would be great. I know a lot of people will laugh but there might be some large holders that will contribute. Perhaps even some hackers stole bitcoin from MtGox can return them. If we by some chance manage to raise enough so that Goxed btc holders get 50% of their bitcoin balance back this would be an excellent outcome.

Yes, I went to all the hassle of verifying my account only to realise this. If only I could get *something* for my btc stuck on mtgox it might save my life.
