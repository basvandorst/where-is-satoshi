What the fuck, man. He was funneling money to an active terrorist organization, it doesn't matter whether he was doing it with bitcoin or Chuck E. Cheese tokens. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:39:00
Because bitcoin is fucking awful as a currency. It's a proof-of-concept that some people managed to convince the world didn't need any iteration, but that doesn't make it not have problems.
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:49:32
In that case, it's even worse, because you can't rely on the behavior. Imagine if next week you woke up and your wallet was empty because an incompatible change was made. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:23:33
So, you believe that killing everyone but yourself is the way to go?
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:06:54
They'll accept bitcoin, but they don't want it any more than they want grain or crude oil or whatever. It's a hassle to turn it into money. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:11:40
Your bank just allows any scam to take money from your account? What bank? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:21:12
And you could get 'disappeared'. Your point?
@_date: 2011-05-10 02:29:18
Depends on context. Tipping someone at a crypto conference with one of these is different than tipping the waitress at Billy Joe's Ribs and Booze with one.
(Edit: Damn, now I'm hungry for ribs...)
@_date: 2011-05-11 19:14:15
And that's what it used to say. Well, mh/ps, same thing. But you edited it to make me look dumb instead of you. &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2011-05-10 23:53:19
In other words, all the advantages of cash, without the disadvantage of requiring physical proximity.
@_date: 2011-05-17 05:58:25
In the US, tax law already handles barter situations, you're legally required to pay tax on the market value of the goods you recieve. (now, next to no one actually reports this... well, the One Red Paperclip guy might have because he was high-profile and thus a nice target to make an example of, but)
@_date: 2011-05-22 01:54:18
Why does everyone say this in EVERY discussion, no matter how irrelevant it is?!
@_date: 2011-05-17 00:52:17
Sure you would, it would just have to be researched the old fashioned way :P
@_date: 2011-05-15 10:08:38
It's certainly possible. We'll find out on Monday.
@_date: 2011-05-22 17:48:07
No, you've cut their income.
Gah, whatever. I'm just going to un-frontpage this subreddit. The signal-to-political-noise ratio is waaaayyy to low.
@_date: 2011-05-11 00:36:40
Yeah, but it's far more difficult than tracking money through bank accounts.
@_date: 2011-04-28 00:12:04
So, he's being optimistic. What's the problem? Not everyone has to be all doom and gloom all the time.
(Personally, I'm interested in bitcoin's technical aspects more than the social aspects, so I probably have a very different outlook than many of the social-aspect users. That's OK. We can still work together, right?)
@_date: 2011-05-17 05:54:56
No, you wouldn't, because there wouldn't be funding to build the subway tunnel.
@_date: 2011-05-05 19:00:16
That doesn't explain the benefits,
@_date: 2011-05-22 17:30:17
Why? How is bitcoin any more related to anarchocapitalism than USD? It's an arbitrary unit of exchange, nothing more.
@_date: 2011-05-20 12:41:03
Wait, you can buy dildos?
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:54:27
A disaster on that scale, everyone will lose their trust in bitcoin and you'll have a bunch of useless data.
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:23:44
Why did you do this on a throwaway? You articulated your points well, and invited further discussion. Personally, I consider Bitcoin is more of a test of the ideas than the end state... you can learn a lot by throwing something in the real world that you couldn't learn in a lab.
@_date: 2011-05-16 06:01:03
Um, yeah. Well, it's not precise, of course, but a block every ten minutes is the target for the average, and difficulty is automatically adjusted to aim for it.
@_date: 2011-04-28 05:54:29
Bitcoin can be taxed just as easily as cash.
@_date: 2011-05-18 03:02:59
I have .05 from the faucet I'll chip in. I'm just siting on it now that I've transfered it between systems a couple times to see how the system works anyway... :P
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:09:57
I said cash, not bank accounts.
@_date: 2011-04-27 19:27:54
Why? It's not illegal to conduct trade in LEGO blocks or clean socks, and those are just as untraceable.
@_date: 2011-04-28 17:18:39
Then you just fucked the world's economy. Heterogeneous systems are better than any single system for basically this reason.
@_date: 2011-05-22 06:43:59
Er, I was refering to the "private central banks" bit, not... meh... &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2011-05-20 03:14:18
StiveGonzales. I'm a fan of clean and cute, and their entry fits both.
@_date: 2011-05-22 17:43:33
Yeah, because monitoring and freezing cash is so easy.
@_date: 2011-05-11 09:07:59
330 megahashes per photoshop?
@_date: 2011-05-10 20:20:22
Yep, has been for ages. When was the last time you actually traded in gold?
@_date: 2011-05-22 02:26:38
Yes, but how is that relevant to whether someone will crack bitcoin? If it's more profitable to play within the system, that's what they'll do, they're not evil for the sake of evil, they just have no morals in their quest to acquire money.
@_date: 2011-05-15 03:05:50
So is USD. \*shrug\*
@_date: 2011-05-09 21:41:10
I don't want group policy enforcement. How do I stop buying the product?
@_date: 2011-04-28 06:15:25
I'm pretty sure it's (legally) already taxed. It's income, you have to declare it. Similarly, you legally have to declare the change that you find on the ground and the twenty that you got for your tenth birthday. No one does, of course, but...
@_date: 2011-04-30 17:48:14
So my 5 bitcents are now worth almost a quarter? Woo!
@_date: 2011-05-21 15:52:38
Send 'em back to the caucet, it's running crazy low. If I can find my old laptop I'll throw the 5 bitcents I have there back at them, too...
@_date: 2011-04-27 19:29:23
Why? It's not illegal to conduct trade in LEGO blocks or clean socks, and those are just as untraceable.
@_date: 2011-05-18 07:16:25
Y'know, if I had a big bank of mining rigs, enough to really impact the network, I'd bring it online right after a retarget. Get a bit of easy mining before it adjusts for my presence.
Just a thought.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:39:05
And where did you learn that? In high school. In the Matrix.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:15:12
Depends on the size of the market. I bet $13000 would be enough to cause noticable fluctuations in the price of a single, specific Magic: The Gathering card.
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:29:34
You DO know you're legally entitled to minimum wage from your employer if tips don't get up to that, right?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:27:18
Are you familiar with the Tragedy of the Commons? You're making it sound extremely fragile yourself.
(The reality of course is that it's just *differently* fragile. It's so different from anything else that it has its own unique weaknesses, just as it's strong against things that traditional currencies aren't.)
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:03:53
From the thing he links at the bottom of the article:
















@_date: 2013-04-29 19:12:15
An active speculation market, yeah. But the point is there will almost certainly never be a day when you can reasonably buy a coffee with btc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:35:01
Consider that he said this about three years ago... there's been what, two since then? I don't follow it that closely, I just come in here and poke around when something interesting happens.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:50:14
The indications are that it's not fine for trade, actually. The value isn't going nuts only compared to fiat currency, but also compared to things like bread, gas, and taxes. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:51:24


Sounds smack on the money to me. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:45:00
It's not my article, the quoting was intended to show that. Sorry. I'll amend the post to make it clearer.
