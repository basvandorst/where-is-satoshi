People buy BTC, increasing demand. Increased demand increases prices. More people buy BTC, increasing demand. Repeat.

The price of a commodity on an exchange is whatever the highest fullfilled buy order is. 
Imagine BTC starts falling to $9k USD, from $11k. Enter Tether, who promises that $1USDT = $1USD, and everyone believes it. Now imagine Tether just prints up a bunch of USDT out of nothing, and then places a bunch of buy orders on an exchange for $10k. If enough people believe $1USDT = $1USD, the price of BTC begins to rise again, so long as all the people selling their BTC accept USDT in exchange. Now that the price starts increasing, people think the dip is ended, and more people start buying in, magically confident that the price will always rise quickly, and now the demand rises even more.
What you've just witnessed is fraud. All of the new buyers have been deceived and sold something that isn't actually worth as much as they believed. Additionally, there's nowhere near as much demand for BTC as there seemed to be, because those bots selling USDT for BTC cease operating once the gig is up and USDT is properly treated as worthless. 
The price of BTC over the past several months has risen because it appeared that there was far higher demand for BTC than there actually was. Once the demand disappears, the price collapses as suddenly there's not enough people buying the BTC that people want to unload, and so the sellers keep lowering their price, hoping to get *anything* back from it before it bottoms out. 
Bottom line: the price of BTC was pumped too high using fraud and fake demand. Now that the fraud is exposed, the price will rightfully collapse.

Let me get this straight. So you are saying that a shadowy organization whose real owners refused to be identified until it was leaked to be the Bitfinex owners in the Paradise Papers, who had their bank accounts shut down for being involved in illegal financial crimes, who refuses to do any business with anyone holding US citizenship, who won't even let you sign up for an account on their website, who claims that they're issuing a magical token that is 1:1 backed by USD but refuses to provide any proof of this claim, whose terms of service insists that they're under no obligation whatsoever to ever cash anyone out, and continues to insist they're being audited despite renowned auditors refusing to go anywhere near this clusterfuck and no actual audit ever appearing, is just magically getting billions of investment in a mere few weeks?
Now I understand you might be financially overinvested in crypto and fear the ultimate crash and are desperate to knock down anyone who exposes the fact that the emperor's clothes don't exist before you can cash out, but I also can't dismiss the fact that you're just wholly uneducated and or delusional.

That was the lie they repeated endlessly to get naive anarchists and libertarians onboard at the start. 
As the mining rewards go down, the network has to start charging fees to confirm transactions, or else no transactions are going to go through and the entire pyramid collapses. 
So now, when you send money, you must attach a transaction fee to it. The transactions with the highest fees get processed first. The transactions with the lowest fees disappear forever and never get processed. 
Since Buttcoin was designed by a moron, it can only handle around 5 transactions a day, naturally making it so that you have to pay around $400 a transaction if you want your money to go anywhere anymore. 
Which is exactly what everyone predicted was going to happen. Hooray.

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:00:41
This is exactly what we've been telling you people for months now. 
The sole reason anyone buys BTC is because they believe they can sell it to someone else down the line for even more than they're paying now. This belief requires those people down the line to actually exist. They do not. Enter Tether.
Tether was using fake money to artificially pump demand. Every BTC bought with tether wasn't true demand, it was artificial fake demand. The only reason the price of BTC seemed high was because fake bots were paying fake dollars that everyone was pretending were real. Once that fake demand disappears, suddenly everyone HODLing realises BTC is nowhere *near* as much demand as they thought, and that there's not actually any people out there willing to spend as much real money on their BTC as there were fake bots willing to spend the same amount of fake money. 
Thus, BTC drops.

Individual coins do not exist. The blockchain is a list of account transfers. When ISIS sends money to an account, all that gets recorded is "Wallet A sends X Satoshis to Wallet B". There's no way at that point to figure out "which" "coins" are the dirty ones, since that wallet's balance is a virtual number that is calculated by going through the blockchain and adding up every transfer into and out of it. 
"blacklisting" would be incredibly self-harming for the bitcoin community. Imagine a chaotic actor who hijacks a million satoshis, and then sends those to a million random wallets that they don't own. It's easy to do, since wallet owners have zero capacity to reject incoming transfers. Should those wallets all be blacklisted? What if they're sent to the largest and most active wallets in the community? It could instantly cripple the entire community. 
Ergo, nobody is ever going to blacklist bad behavior on the blockchain, because it could easily be weaponized to destroy the entire thing.

@_date: 2018-11-30 22:45:50
Bitcoin is a ledger, meaning that the ledger records entries that look like this: 
* Wallet A sends X BTC to Wallet B
* Wallet C sends Y BTC to Wallet D.
* etc
When you send money to an "invalid" address, the blockchain records that "invalid" address is now the owner of those bitcoins. 
The problem is that nobody knows how to calculate the private key associated with that "invalid" address. So nobody can sign a transaction indicating that they want to send those bitcoins to another wallet anymore. 
There's one way of trying to retrieve the coins, which is to brute force private keys to see if any hash down to the public address. This process will probably take millions of years given current algorithmic understanding and available CPU power. It's possible in the future that someone could break this in a reasonable timeframe, but if that becomes possible then the entirety of Bitcoin becomes worthless as any address can now be hacked. 
So long story short, those coins are now lost forever.

I guarantee you most people hodling BTC on exchanges are already holding "borrowed" (ie: Fractionally lent) coins. 
As long as your BTC exists as a number in the exchange's database and is being hedl in someone elses's wallet, there's a chance that they've lent yours out to someone else without telling either party. This allows the exchange to extract extra profit by selling BTC that simply doesn't exist, and gambling that there won't be a run on the bank. 
Many people suspect that Tether is now being used to keep the price of BTC pumped high to prevent that run and show that Bitfinex is actually insolvent and has lent out all of its hodlings. 
We'll see what happens in the next few weeks, I suppose. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:12:58

Because the value of crypto is entirely dependent upon finding people who value it higher than you do, which is highly dependent on positive thoughts being spread about crypto. If people lose faith, it collapses, and there's a lot of people who really don't want their numbers to go down. Therefore, they must attack anyone who says negative things about crypto... even if those negative things are entirely true.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:10:11
Just some advice: When an organization is touting billions of dollars of assets, it's usually the onus of the organization to prove their claim by showing a reputable and accurate audit of their books. Bitfinex'd may not have any proof that Tether is insolvent, but since making his claims they've done exactly nothing to prove what they're claiming is true. Bitfinex'd may be just guessing, but every fucking day that goes by and Tether keeps doing even more shady shit means that I, and everyone else, should trust them even less. 
It's not FUD. It's reasonable skepticism. It's up to Tether to prove that their asset is worth billions. Not the other way around. All they have to do is provide an audit to prove him full of shit. Yet... they cannot. Doesn't that bother you?

That's why I used "invalid" in quotation marks. Yes technically it's valid. But if there's no private key used to derive it... for all intents and purposes it's invalid.

When the mining rewards shrink far enough, no miners would agree to this as it would cost more money to run the rigs than they gain from TX's.

If that's your reasoning, then this is not a valid complaint against fiat either.

Well, yes. Because it's now worth $3k and falling. So it was overpriced and people took a hell of a haircut. 
It's nice being right. ;)


Heeh. Ok. Let's see it hit 40k, "no problems". 
Wait it's still falling? Isn't that a problem?
Oh well. ;)

If it's too complex for most people to use, then how exactly do you expect it to reach mass adoption?

I don't understand why I would agree with them when BTC's price falls to $0.21?

Which results in a network that is far easier to take over with a 51% attack when all those inactive miners are turned back on in a sudden rush once the mining rewards fall far enough.


As I said above. The alternative is to compromise the security of the network. So it's either push up hash power or the network fails. 
Your choice, really. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

As your kind so often states, "zoom out". 
Down 80% YTD ;)
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:26:40
Apparently you can't read "YTD". Shocking, and yet so cocksure. 
I change my mind. HODL your heart out. I'll be here to lick your salty tears when it reaches 0 ;)

More efficient rigs just means more people run them. Otherwise the PoW pool gets too small, easy to take over, and the network starts to see 51% attacks.
There is no way for your math to work without compromising the integrity of the network.

No he won't ;)
