It would be policies introduced by SOCIALISTS that brought people out of poverty. These things like 8 hour work days and 5 day work weeks were fought for by SOCIALISTS and were undermined by CAPITALISTS.
Capitalism is nothing but a system for exploitation. You people are a fucking joke.

All you're doing is using ad hominem attacks because it's clear you have literally no idea what you're talking about.

You don't know what Socialism is. You said that Socialism doesn't empower the masses. It's a joke to anyone who has taken a political science course. What you just said makes no sense. 
It's clear you have never read into Socialism or capitalism.

And what about the millions it's put into poverty in other countries? The countries that they outsource their labor to in order to get away with paying less?

Anarchism is Socialism. You don't need to be a USSR tankie to be a socialist

Capitalism empowers the few. How could anyone think it empowers the many?

What are you arguing again? That's what SOCIALISM does, not capitalism. Capitalism is literally the DIRECT opposite to having the rights to your labor. 
Since it's very clear you have basically NO idea what you're talking about, I'ma just leave

Anarchism is a socialist ideology. Your clear lack of understanding is hilarious.
