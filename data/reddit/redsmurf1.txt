ISn't GDAX owned by Coinbase?

I bought straight from the manufacturer website, For the sake of peace of mind it was worth the extra costs than having to worry about a tampered product. I also wiped the device and tested the recovery mode.

They don’t sell them in Canada or at the Canadian Walmart or Amazon for both countries, and i can’t find them any where online to purchase. Thinking of buying $100 worth as a gag gift. So i’ll have to travel down to Bellingham as it’s the closest one from Vancouver. 
Will be interesting when crossing the border and declaring them. LOL
