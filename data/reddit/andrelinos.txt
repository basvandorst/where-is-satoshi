The lazlo pizza guy is indeed in this business for the technology. And he is the pioneer. Who bought another pizza a few weeks ago within lightning network?
Who knows/guess how many wallets this guy has/have...

Let's see what the Oracle says
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:07:53
If this type of info was in a blockchain back then, now we could track the real Satoshi!

To made an t-shirt of this in 3, 2, 1...
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:14:42
I was too recklessly patient in 6 of January...
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:47:44
And I'm a fan
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:19:24
Yes! But even today, those coins should be sold only with a plus because their legendary log.
Instead be dirty coins should be considered desirable coins. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:40:59
For sure. But who will be buying this dip?
@_date: 2019-11-23 10:43:43
So Trump is bullish too! Good to think of that!
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:07:13
In my view those coins could have an plus in price by their legendaryness...
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:13:20
And wait for the Zuckerberg's (bot)coin, then huge because big! Lol
But... Who knows...
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:05:59
Yeah! But Skynet is late.
@_date: 2018-06-15 10:52:49
This is it!
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:44:23
You should be labeled as legendary! Same as Bitcointalk.
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:07:34
In poor countries an Camry is expensive!   Then considered a luxury car...
And let's believe that satoshi didn't plan to cash out yet, and maybe don't give a shit to pairing the price with USD.
(How we (me) like to imagine things! Don't we?)
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:49:24
That guy has mooned bro.... That's why
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:12:54
And an electrum wallet accessible through you fb account
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:56:02
And then the taxes are at the highest . Now instead we have lower fees, or affordable at least.
Are we now prepared for Mass adoption? (Note that I mean Mass being at least PayPal users adoption)
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:16:44
He's smart for sure but to me I think that the twins are smarter. They had the Facebook idea and bought btc earlier. Don't you think?
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:53:49
Actually missed an Bitcoin mention in wreck it Ralph... Anyone?
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:08:42
A $10 Million worth of BTC  to 2 million is a tolerable crash for me...
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:02:31
Good one! But another is: 
smells like fomo spirit
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:57:48
Iron Man! Is that you?
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:22:32
Central Bank scam? Mmmm No, no, no
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:56:31
Yeah! This guy is most known among the Japanese... Lol
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:06:46
're you Satoshi? Thnx
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:47:15
How I'm expecting an transaction from that legendary Genesis address... Someday...
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:10:42
OMG! This name only appears when a bull run will start!
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:06:43
Lacks the /s
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:23:30
So that's the awesomeness of all of this. Isn't it?
I believe that will not take much time to surge blockchain forensics and try to suggest some addresses, right?
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:44:58
Are we lemmings?
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:19:46
Get Vitalik on the line!
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:30:46
So this person or entity is like the joker!
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:14:40
Thundering network?
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:27:16
Thanos? Is that you?
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:40:50
Certainly can shake for a while. Till the next bull run begins.
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:23:40
This is true, but for me all nakamoto's address are Genesis (just my thought). Imagine how excited the community will be when a transaction happens from any of his addresses? 
May he/she return the tips received?
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:39:02
Thought so. Thanks for the replies!
For example: Finney's addresses are known?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:03:09
An input of at least 300b in Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:17:22
Was the greatest idea ever! If that hasn't happened, who knows how much more time could take to BTC get adoption?
@_date: 2019-01-13 13:57:27
What is it?
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:22:12
 You've said all
1. Also is amusing to watch the SEC approval journey since when, 2013? And people speculating, trading viewing and getting rekked (or rekted?) 
2. Why the f--- people are expecting regulation? We don't need that, but why they want it? To the moon? This will go to the moon regardless...(my wish, but, as always, do your own research!)
3. I'm mostly hodling for years to come and spending preferably with merchants who give discounts when using crypto. If I become a entrepreneur, I'll give discount to cryptocoiners for sure. Would you too?

Ver is like Vader: people (not "luck" ones) come to the bcash side
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:01:55
It would be Lambos?
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:05:53
But Ver has done so much from the adoption of Bitcoin core /s 
Seems to me he is a kind of a Grand Master that no one listen anymore...
@_date: 2018-07-28 12:54:08
An script could compare the customer data and their public key and follow the payment. Isn't it right?
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:43:57
Really impossible? Any programmer could respond to us?
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:30:27
He Fomo'ed
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:36:16
You're right: I can't imagine a world like that despite of the efforts of the code.org.
The intention was not an payment company to interfere, but an free open source (ad free cause it's for the community) app that tracks if an given public key has sent that amount of Bitcoin and it's confirmed.
You could give an simple name or code for each costumer and the app tracks it for you and give notifications and a complete report in the end of the shift/day/week.
This couldn't  help small online businesses and help increase adoption?
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:29:49
Have you talked to your accountant? Cause you will need one. IRS already have you by now.
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:41:58
Till now this facts implies that you are right! The real question, indeed, is: what are the odds that nakamoto could be someone else Instead Hal-Nick?
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:14:18
Thought it was Korean fud...
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:54:41
You're right about keep your coins out of exchanges, but do you really think that would be smart for binance and all similar to fuck their own business on purpose to rekt everyone? And loose possibility of making progressive profit from fees and their own coin. Considering that they work on 2b daily volume (generally) how much fees do they receive with that?
And considering (believing) that this market has the potential to grow exponentially, would be smart and safe for him to do such crime? Instead of maintain a good evaluated business? 
I do trust them until now. 
But true: keep your holdings in your own wallet...
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:43:07
Yeah! There are many issues with exchanges here and there, but take Gox as example: did Karpeles let be hacked on purpose? Or he just stole the coins? Do you believe that?
I'm not saying that this isn't possible, but till now I don't see that way.
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:03:23
Only Marty McFly works like that...
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:36:59
Will we have the Harlem shake revival then?
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:34:28
The Wall Street I mentioned above is a bar in São Paulo with the same features you described that is in UK.
I think that a place like that would drive the crypto people (crypsters?) to frequent this bar/pub, because, this is the future.
Wish this utopic society happens some day, but actually think that the future will be such a cyberpunk world with no jobs an robots everywhere. At least who owns one simple Bitcoin will be King...
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:40:50
Nice! Where do we buy this?
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:37:51
Fair enough! Aaron is such an idol for me, but they both were fairly convicted??? That's the more  important comparison!
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:28:56
Hey what about a bar in São Paulo with the same features that the Wall Street has but using real time (accepted) crypto prices in the walls?
Good idea?
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:02:11
hahaha! But we've to agree that this market is pretty much creepy.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:29:52
Yes! Like the Aaron Schwartz case. At least he didn't suicide... For good or for bad he is such a visionary.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:18:53
What about crypsters?
