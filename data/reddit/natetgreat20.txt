Good lord, I swear a dip brings out some of the whiniest, self-loathing zombies I've ever seen. You've got one asshole who keeps 'bragging' about their real estate and stock market portfolio being better than their bitcoin portfolio atm, to other morons saying bitcoin is going to 0 for good. It shows more about their mental and emotional instability to continue posting such garbage on here. I will cut to the truth. NO ONE HERE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION. Please go see a psycho analyst, as it is clear you need to talk to someone who will listen and help you. When will this board actually return to level-headed, mindful conversation about bitcoin and its revolution? Everything about these posts of people complaining about not making money is exactly what Bitcoin is NOT about. When Bitcoin goes back up next week, these same zombies will either disappear or be rooting for the climb like a bunch of money-grubbing automatons. FFS, have some dignity when things get a little difficult and don't go the way you want them to. And please, show some balls by not trying to drag others into your grim view point, which consequentially will be proven wrong eventually.

What is the reason for the big slide this past week? Things were churning upward so nicely. Thought we were breaking 10k easily. Is it because Bill Gates opened his yap in opposition to crypto? I thought he was a good guy. Gotta protect those billions, Bill? After all, wouldn't your software be a 'fairly direct' cause for people buying and selling drugs over the internet? Hypocrite.

My stiff dork is more unbreakable than 6500. As much as I want you to be right, that is just a stupid prediction and you know it.

6500 is the new resistance, not support.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:42:54
What's comical is that people believe the hypocrisy which is the government. 'This dip is because the government is investigating market manipulation'. Isn't releasing this news manipulation in and of itself?? If there was a real reason for a competent government to examine wrong doing and manipulation, with actual intent to penalize, fix, and regulate it, they would have done so long ago whilst keeping it as hush as possible. The fact is that the US government is as big of crooks as those manipulating the crypto market and a lot less competent too. They are just too dumb to realize that crypto markets will never be completely regulated if at all. These dips are fully the cause of large money interests (governments included) manipulating price in order to shake out scared bitcoin owners so that they can accumulate; simple as that.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:11:17
I would say the party is over now. Huge dump about to come. We will likely go to the depths of $6000 before this is all said and done. The zombie predictions of $25,000 by year's end is a total pie in the sky pump prediction.  The honest truth is, no one cares about bitcoin anymore.  And, the powers that be will keep it that way to maintain their fiat dream. This is truly an ongoing war for many years to come. Someday Bitcoin will be the currency of choice, but it's not happening for many more years.

@_date: 2018-05-28 17:01:42
Honestly, when checking BTC price, who else here is now conditioned to believe that the price will be lower than the last time you checked. The fact just hit me today that I have that condition....

@_date: 2018-05-22 21:31:54
I'm sorry you feel that way. My post actually was trying to relay my aptitude for holding long as I have been doing for some time. Plus mining daily to boot. Just because a post is negative doesn't mean it's not realistic.  I have no intention of selling, probably forever...
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:41:44
Yup, just what I said a few days ago. We clear 9700 next week. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:21:07
Did you read my entire post? Clearly not. It's comically obvious that those who claim I am full of desperation, despair, pessimism, and bought at ATH are indeed that themselves. Stating a very sound statement that the price could go down is far healthier than being blindly optimistic in hope of making a quick buck. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:09:38
Hey, Tom Lee. That was a spot-on prediction about Consensus 2018 skyrocketing the price of Bitcoin. Any other advice I should stake my life on??

Just keeps going down... This is getting entertaining now. I like the suspense waiting for the bottom to hit. Keep going down and buy!!! Too easy.

This drop is a very bad sign. Do not buy. It will go much lower.

Well, it won't, Rookie...
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:58:44
Well in the meantime, it appears to have had the opposite effect. If this drops below 7800, I'm using my kid's college fund to buy more. This low drop will bounce hard back into the high 9k's by the end of next week. Mark this post. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:37:03

@_date: 2018-05-12 16:59:45

Not sure what regs you are speaking of. Regulation will only help the price in the long run. Plus, the regulations have been positive here in the USA. Plus, wasn't stricter regulations the FUD used during January? That's old news....

@_date: 2018-06-11 11:40:51
I'll weigh in here.
First of all, most people here are clearly only concerned about price action and not the technology. My personal stance is both. I love the tech and believe it is the future. But, I'd also like to make decent money with my investments in Bitcoin and all other quality cryptos. Who wouldn't? 
Regardless of what the naysayers are feeding you, Bitcoin will rebound big and reach all time highs by the end of 2018. And yes, this view is just as valid as those saying it will go to 4k, or be in a bear market for 2 years. However, if you actually read the analytics, Bitcoin is technically not in a bear market yet. And, with the degree of manipulation in this market, I wouldn't be surprised if this recent plunge is to shake weakies for the next boost. We still are not even close to February lows, so I'm not sure why people lose their shit over a little dip. Higher lows keep posting month after month. And, very soon more and more institutional money will flood the market. If people continue to monitor the small day trends looking to make money and complain and scare off new investors when that doesn't happen, they will continue to be disappointed.  But, if they step back to look at the big picture, remain patient, and HODL, bitcoin is easily the best investment out there currently. After all the pissing and moaning, bitcoin is still up 135% on the year. Even if it is half that percentage next year, where else can you get that kind of return on your money?

This is just getting tiresome now. I mean, what really is the fucking point anymore? It doesn't have mass adoption. Its store of value is essentially more and more worthless with each passing week. And, the average cost to mine it is closely approaching its price. I really just want to see it drop so far down that the miners shut down and it collapses once and for all. As much as I want to believe all the stupid predictions of '15k by July' and other such BS, the average human is too stupid to give three shits about ever buying or using this useless currency.  Bitcoin has lost. Humans don't deserve this technology and clearly have no clue what to do with it now that they have it. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:35:00
What happened to this forum? I thought all conversation was to refrain from price predictions and complaints, yet that's all this discussion has become. People constantly whining that they are down in their investment or letting everyone know they are selling because the price is crashing is embarrassing. Or, zombies asking 'when moon/lambo?' which is not even remotely humorous anymore. And, for those that claim no factual information by crying 'Bitcoin is dead', or 'mining is ruining the environment', have some dignity. You sound like assholes. Statements like these are grossly nearsighted  and paint a grim picture of where Bitcoin is headed. These comments are flat out false and driven by ignorance and fear. Dumb, uneducated, and false commentary adds nothing to the discussion here.

I have been saying this all along. These 'support' levels are illusions the weak-minded like to cling to to allow them to sleep at night. This market is a collection of garbage investors with no consistency, no market fundamentals, and will sadly end up losing a lot of money for a lot of people.

@_date: 2018-03-07 19:22:40
When China and Japan wake up tomorrow this is all over. We will see the price plummet to sub $4000.

Why did no one listen to me? I've been called a troll and many other choice names.  I said last Sunday that BTC will be $7000 this Sunday, and it's right on track. The falling knife cuts deep. It will be &lt; $4000 by the end of March. This fairytale is over.  I seriously suggest selling all now before you lose more. Unless, you like watching it fall into the depths of hell.
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:33:15

Buying dips is one thing. Buying at 80% loss is even better. But, how much of the lay population who knows nothing about anything is going to say, 'Hey, Jed! Bitcoin just dropped 100%! Let's but it all up'? By lay population I mean 99% of the population, as no one has a clue what is going to happen next.

@_date: 2018-03-08 20:35:40
I don't  know where  the bottom is, but BTC will easily goto $7000 by this Sunday and &lt;$4000 by the end of March. It is a selling blood bath and anyone holding is going to have to wait a long time if they expect to see prices in the $10k's again.

This is grossly false. Bitcoin is backed by demand and the blockchain. Demand is backed by an ever-fluctuating price, and the blockchain that runs it requires miners and energy to secure transactions.  The fact that bitcoin is finite only augments the value that is put in to create it (out of thin air)...
Speaking of thin air, how's fiat currency valid and backed? Not to mention, the exponentially larger amount of resources required to create it (out of thin air), store it, transport it, distribute/disperse, and corrupt it.

Welp, looks like holding 8k may not happen. Plunging fast now. Weeeeeee
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:07:23
Takes one to know one?
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:11:19
Here's the bounce back to $8200!!!
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:06:55
Wrong sub, my friend. Great story though.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:02:06
Up 1k in 24 hours; slowly creeping back down 1k in the next 24 hours. Oh Bitcoin, you evil temptress. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:51:57
Why the big dump?
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:52:03
This price action is garbage. Will it ever break 10k? At this rate,  I could care less if it falls to 5k. It's all the same as far as I'm concerned.  Lame.

Why does everyone want bcash dead? They are both good. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:31:31
Looks like it is slowly trending back down since it peaked at 8k. How far back down will it go?.....
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:24:47
There will be no $7400. Maybe $7700, maybe. By Friday it will be $9000 and won't look back. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:17:12
Hehe. You are clearly one of them. Don't proclaim to ever know another's situation. $50 investment? Try $200. Moron indeed...
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:44:12
$1000 drop in 12 hours; can't make this stuff up. I love you, Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:53:27
How do you know what I have invested? And it's my fault because why? I put as much as I could afford into purchasing BTC and investing in mining equipment. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:34:54
This is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:56:18
So much for 8k. Back to 6k by the end of Sunday. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:06:22
I agree 100% with you.  But, it's frustrating to see gains to 9500 only to be lost back to 9100. I think we'd all like to see it break 10k and stay there.  Am I wrong? What's keep keeping it down? Just so tired of the manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:06:45
Though I understand your cost analysis, I did not evaluate my personal situation that way as it did not apply.  I agree that mining is more difficult for some and not profitable for others. I even use the heat from the miners to heat my home in the winter, so I save on energy costs there. With summer coming, I will have to spend energy on cooling, though that should be fully covered by the solar array too. I was fortunate enough to recoup costs for equipment during the ATH. My situation is an outlier, sure. But, to make a blanket statement that 'mining is not profitable' is far from the truth. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:05:38
Huge sell-off coming. Was this the end of the bull run already?
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:29:06
All dips are being bought up. Bears are losing. 9k coming fast. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:13:52
Why can't it just keep going up every day? Like Burger King, I want it my way. If it doesn't go to 10k by week's end,  then I'm selling it all. I will then proclaim that everyone vested in crypto is a fool and that Bitcoin is dead. Waaaaaaahh!
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:12:06
That is rude to call someone a troll. I am entitled to my completely uneducated opinion like everyone else here. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:28:54
Annnd back down it goes. Was fun while it lasted, but not really. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:47:54
Fair enough, but you shouldn't make such a bold, false statement about mining profitability without explaining that yourself. 
Though mining profitability has fallen, you can still gain net profits depending on what your energy cost is. I'm running x10 S9 antminers on full solar energy at essentially 100% profit. Even if I tapped into the grid, I would still be making a small profit because the kWh cost in my area is fairly cheap. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:24:02
This will be the last week for these sub 9k prices. Buy it up!
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:37:46
How far down does it go? Place your bets.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:20:58
Eat my shorts, man.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:17:14
It was all a manipulation to shake out weak hands. It'll be back to 9500k by the end of the day. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:51:08
Nothing like having the day's entire gains erased in 1 hour...gotta love it. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:37:55
You are correct. I do not troll with a hidden agenda. I simply like to shake things up in this forum. It's more fun and funnier to deal with all the painful swings which this market endures.
