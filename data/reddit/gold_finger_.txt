Here are money's 7 characteristics.   I would assert that BTC is neither characteristics 4 and 7.  Agree? 
(1) It must be durable, which is why we don’t use wheat or corn or rice.
(2) It must be divisible, which is why we don’t use art work.
(3) It must be convenient, which is why we don’t use lead or copper.
(4) It must be consistent, which is why we don’t use real estate.
(5) It must possess value in itself, which is why we don’t use paper.
(6) It must be limited in the quantity that is available, which is why we don’t use aluminum or iron.
(7) It should have a long history of acceptance, which is why we don’t use molybdenum or rhodium.

so the denominator is 8888...  That's the next top for BTC IMO.  ;)  AU and AG still should be priced far higher.  We all know it...

LMAO said thousands of years of history...  try again, newb..

Definition... gold is money.  BTC by definition is not.  Hence gold should be valued higher.  That's my point.

I'm the bodhizafa if you must know.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:28:39
Lol.. you're totally missing the point.  But I expect that from someone who is not willing to listen to reason.  Congrats on your earnings.   I'm only arguing that AU and AG should be valued by the market far higher.  That's all...
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:39:08
Totally disagree about 3.  Gold is accepted anywhere for currency.    And 2, it's not easily divisible but it can certainly be divided.  Gold meets all the criteria for money, BTC does not.  What is the value of an ounce of gold?  Value....
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:27:43
It makes sense since it's producing results...  I'm arguing that gold and silver are drastically under valued by definition... That's all..
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:13:25
I'm just going to say it...  AG and AU should be priced far higher than BTC.  BTC has utility, but AG and AU are money by definition.  ;)  
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:08:15
Definition is what maters IMO, not strictly utility.  Feel sorry for me if you like, but the reality remains the same, gold and silver are money and greatly under valued IMO.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:54:14
I don't disagree with your point here.  People will pay for an asset what they believe it's worth.  I'm trying to draw a parallel between the BTC price and the AG/AU price.  We all know where cryptos are headed, why not AG/AU as well?  By definition they are a better form of money.  That is my point in a nutshell.

What's in it for youtube?

lol... take it to your local coin dealer.   Cash paid, always.  Frankly have no idea what you're talking about here.  At the end of the day, you're not able to take your BTC to the coin dealer and trade for fiat.  Not today folks.

I think they're already too disruptive in the market.  Adding Bitcoin would only add to the disruption and potential backlash from government.  That's my two pesos worth anyway... -G
