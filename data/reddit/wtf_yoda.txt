My question is: why should sidechains be forced on the users of Bitcoin by an artificial technical constraint, rather than grow naturally to fill a need not met by the base Bitcoin protocol (like the scenario you describe above)?

You are mistaken.  Dollars are not backed.  At this very moment, the Federal Reserve is printing dollars out of thin air and using them to buy bonds and mortgage backed securities from banks.  Those dollars did not exist prior to the Fed creating them, and the Fed has no obligation to pay them back or remove them from the system.

The more the CoinValidation scheme gains traction, the more it will become the default setup for large corporations like Amazon.  If that becomes the default, then plain Bitcoin not connected to some 3rd party auditing service is relegated to the black market.  This allows state governments to retain control over money and taxes and keeps the same people in power.

There seems to be a general consensus on this board and among bitcoin enthusiasts in general that if there is some huge financial collapse due to growing world debt, that bitcoin holders will make out like bandits.  I've been mining since early 2011, and I've bought in long term on the idea of crypto-currency, but I'm not so sure that premise is true in a collapse.  When a crisis hits, people get nervous, and they want to make sure they can put food on the table.  If the lights turn off, and there is complete pandemonium, gold can put food on the table, but bitcoins are worthless.  Even if the lights don't "turn off," bitcoin is still a very volatile, speculative investment (in most people's eyes anyway).  
My observations are totally non-scientific, but on days when the stock market tanks (for whatever reason), bitcoin doesn't go up, it goes down too, meaning it's positively correlated to the stocks, and investors overall don't view bitcoin as a "safe" investment.  In the long term, bitcoin will obviously be more positively correlated to gold, due to it's limited nature, but don't fool yourselves into thinking bitcoin is a safe investment in a financial crisis.

The reason it doesn't need to be "backed" is because Bitcoin itself has inherent value.  If you want to send someone across the world money, you don't have to pay a ridiculous fee to Western Union, or wait weeks for a check to clear.  If you are a business, and you want to take electronic payments, you don't have to pay a 3% (and a monthly fee) to a payment processor just to do that.  If you are a saver, you don't have to worry about how much money the government is going to print up and give away to the banks.

I like the paper, and agree with you 100% that additional layers on top of Bitcoin is the way to go vs. alternate blockchains which dilute the value of Bitcoin, and all virtual currency.  What makes me a little uneasy is the "trusted entity" and the reward coins it receives.  I get that part will subsidize the creation of additional functionality on top of Bitcoin and which is good, but it still makes me a little uneasy.  As long as the influence and power of the "trusted entity" declines over time, it bothers me less.

I think there were many smart who saw this coming early on. I started mining in 2011, and I don't even put myself in that group.  But it is surprising that so many people (even people who supposedly keep up with technology trends) have failed to see the revolutionary nature behind it, and belittled bitcoin as some kind of Napster meets paypal for hackers. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 02:30:31
At first I thought the theory was wrong because I was able to open an account, deposit bitcoins and trade within an hour, but after reading the FAQ at mtgox, I'm realizing that it is much easier to sell bitcoins without being verified than it is to buy.  Any deposits coming through Dwolla (buyers), or any deposits in Euros require a verified account (buyers), and anyone investing more than $50000, requires a verified account (buyers).  I think it is a safe bet that the verification queue is definitely holding down prices, and as they get processed their will be upward pressure for a week at least barring any catastrophic news. Many of those accounts in the queue are likely to be high value accounts which could put significant upward pressure on the price.

Also, the total number of bitcoins **approaches** 21 million, but doesn't ever get to that point, even once we get to 20,900,000, there will still be incentive to mine. The rewards will be smaller in terms of bitcoins awarded, but theoretically bitcoins should be worth more at that point.

Think Amazon in 1999.  Was there a lot of hype? sure.  Was it caught in the dot-com bubble? sure, but it was also an investment in a company that was revolutionary in terms of how it did business, with REAL long term potential.  Bitcoin is similar:  A disruptive technology, that people are piling money into right now (though it is still relatively unknown to the common investor), and will go MUCH higher in the long run.

Market psychology is FAR from random.  If you think of the bitcoin market in terms of it's constituents, you have...
- The hardcore believers.  These investors are growing daily at a steady rate, they provide the floor under which the price will not fall.
- The swing traders.  These are the people that may or may not think Bitcoin is a good long term investment, but they amplify the drops when they happen, and they also are the primary cause of the rebounds when as a group they determine that the correction has hit bottom.
- Sheep.  These are the week kneed investors who hear about some great investment from a friend or family member, and they buy not really understanding what they are buying, or the long term potential.  They sell in a panic when the correction starts, and give their money over to the traders, and then realize they shouldn't have put their money in Bitcoin in the first place.
The correction happens when the buyers collectively thin out as the price goes vertical, and those looking to sell take over and the free fall starts.  It will happen in the next 24 hours, and when it does, I will post a link back to this thread.

The US Dollar IS on course to lose it's status as the standard reserve currency to the Chinese Yuan.  All you have to do is extend out the GDP growth trends of China and the US over the last 20 years, and 20 years from now China will dwarf the US in economic terms.  That and the fact that the Chinese government is the largest single holder of US debt.  A few other points:
- If the US government saw Bitcoin as a threat, it would have shut it down long ago by declaring it illegal, shutting down Bitcoin based businesses in the US and pressuring other governments to follow suit.  
- The overwhelming majority of Bitcoins are held by Americans and western Europeans.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:17:41
When you consider bitcoin related hacking, and the disperportionate amount of DDOS attacks that have occurred to Bitcoin related businesses, mining pool operators etc, it SEEMS like there are definitely some powerful entity or entities trying to subvert bitcoin.  However, I think the Chinese and Russian governments are much more likely the sponsors of those attacks, and being highly autocratic, their leaders have a lot to lose.  Also, I think the US government is far less afraid of bitcoin than many other countries that are on weaker ground financially.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:16:41
Of course you can't predict with any accuracy when, but you can see the stars aligning, and have a good idea that it is probably on the horizen. The correction happens when the traders determine that the price is getting ahead of itself, and they go to the sidelines.  Once the price stalls enough they determine that it's time to take profit and sell en-masse.
The main reason I say it is coming is because if there were an option to draw the 5 day moving average on the chart, you would see that over the last 12 hours or so the price has diverged from the moving average quite a bit. It also looks like it it losing momentum every time it tries to break $90. Could it pick back up and shoot through $100? Sure, but I doubt it will happen before another correction. We'll see soon enough if I'm right.

The difference in the case of Crypto-currencies is that Litecoin is almost identical to Bitcoin, (which isn't true of Apple and Microsoft).  The result is Litecoin is not creating unique value, but rather feeding off of value generated by the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I'm not sure of the specifics, I just know that it is possible to buy investments in currencies, commodities, and market indexes that mirror the price of underlining investments.  QQQ is a ticker that tracks the Nasdaq index.  There are a dozen or more ETFs that track the price of gold etc.  
I believe the money invested in the fund would flow into the bitcoin economy indirectly, but I'm not sure of the specifics.  Maybe when the fund gets kicked off, a specific number of shares are created, and the fund purchases the same number of bitcoins.  Then the shares are sold in dollars which would equal the investment in bitcoins.

Not exactly.  E-Trade, Scottrade etc. have local branches you can go to.  You can also give them your bank account/routing number directly and they can draft a check from your account (or wire them money).  Mt. Gox doesn't have that capability, you have to use Dwolla or some other third party most people have never heard of. Also MOST people with the means to invest in bitcoin already have a funded brokerage account. If they could just type in a symbol, from their computer and click 'buy' it would definitely ease the flow of money into BTC. That said, a leveraged ETF would be cool too, although BTC has plenty of volatility as it is.

Way to many people like you looking to get in at a bargain price for it to drop much.  Every time there is a mild dip, bargain hunters swoop in, and the price bounces back.  If you follow this you will see lots of posts from people frustrated that they can't get bitcoins faster and easier.  It is very early, and there is a lot of hype, but also a lot of long term potential.
You could wait for the weekend, and see if you get lucky, drops seem to happen Friday through Sunday, but it's just as likely to be $115 to $120 by then with no drop to speak of.
