Some people want to fill the world with silly altcoins.

It took me two days to transfer from my bank account into Dwolla, but how long does it take for one's deposit initiated from Dwolla to appear in my Mt. Gox account? It was pretty easy to do, almost too easy. I followed the directions, sending my cash from Dwolla to the account they said to do, and included the MTGOX tag in the notes, as Mt. Gox said was required.

I don't know whether to vote that up or down. I'll have to see replies first.

Their show is fun and they make some fascinating observations that only they could possibly dream up, but if you start taking them too seriously, you're headed straight down the rabbit hole before you know what hit you. No Agenda can be hilarious, and it can even be quite thought-provoking, and I can't miss an episode myself, but they are hardly authorities on the topics they discuss.

This post is almost exactly what I wanted to SCREAM at these guys as they were giving their "theory" on Bitcoin. You said it better than I could have.

I think this "Thailand Bans Bitcoin" story is getting tremendously distorted. From what I'm reading, a Bitcoin startup approached the Bank of Thailand asking if Bitcoin was legal. The bank's opinion apparently was that since there exist no laws explicitly making Bitcoin legal, it is considered illegal by default. The media, who seems to loathe Bitcoin, took this and ran with it. The Thai government has not passed any legislation banning Bitcoin, from what I understand. This was just the Bank of Thailand's official position, which is apparently not even binding. If I am wrong about any of this, please correct me. I am just judging from what I have been reading.
