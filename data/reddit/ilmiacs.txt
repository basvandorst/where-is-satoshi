Sure, I don‘t argue with that. My point is just that owning bitcoin still can save your ass when there is financial collapse, even if bitcoin is not anywhere close to a replacement for fiat. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:10:57
Ah, yeah. In that case, it just occurs to me that my bitcoins are organic, too. Want any? (The price of course is elevated as compared to conventional bitcoins, because they are so organic.)

To the downvoter: Would you mind to comment?
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:03:42
Technical analysis is always bs.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:15:48
What is an organic market?
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:57:16
No. I say this because there is no single reason  why technical analysis should work. I have a PhD in statistical physics and work in the field of AI. I am into Bitcoin since 2011 and I worked at banks in risk management for years. So I know what I am talking about. If you don‘t believe me, you can read The Black Swan by N.N. Taleb, which nicely explains why people like to believe in that kind of religion.

You probably are observing a known statistical effect that is called reversal (or regression) to the mean, and it does not imply causality. 
The best advice you can give to drive BTC price up is to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:23:39
Or it may make it worthy. Transferring your assets into crypto when fiat is becoming worth less makes perfect sens imho. If others think like that, too, this would increase bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:19:34
Exactly.

But the Venezuelan who bought Bitcoin a year ago is better off than the one who kept his precious Bolivars.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:21:35
Well, even without having any practical use today, he could easily cash out.
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:35:10
Sorry, I don't get it. Mind to elaborate?

If this would be true, the scientists would be the richest. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:42:52
You are exactly right. According to the OPs specifications the rule could also be sth. like "append 82un4g3s to the passphrase". I just somehow rely in the OPs *fairness* wrt this. :-)
My algo would be able to cope with it theoretically, but I don't have a rig, so I can check just a couple of addresses per second. When I introduce a second character, the number of possibilities explodes to more than a million possible phrases. So it would take me some days to calculate just those. 
Was fun, anyway. :-)

He bought 50BTC for $650 each. Then he had 50.2 BTC and could have sold for under $600. The math is just fine.
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:16:20
Congratulations! I was on a quite similar track (check the [sample of rules]( I have posted earlier here. you will find the append rule as well as nouns as a target.) and gave up after checking two character combinations. Would the stakes have been higher, I most probably would have persisted. 
I exactly agree, the 5 word limit was the most helpful constraint here. On the other hand, the length of the inserted combo of characters (here "$") is surely the biggest driver of entropy. If it was 5 characters long, I doubt anybody would have taken the coins until the end of the month.

Ok, I was bored, too. I really like that problem setting. The OP highlights an interesting point. I am slowly becoming convinced that selecting a well-known text and applying an obfuscation rule is sufficiently secure for a brainwallet.
So yesterday I wrote a passphrase **obfuscation engine** based on human language. It would first generate rules (like *"append # to every second word"* or *"swap wovels with right neighbor"*) and then apply the rule to the original phrase. I took into account only short rules that fit into 6 english words, and also they were limited by my phantasy. 
Like this, I brute forced more than 16k phrases... without any success. 
[Here]( the list. 
Quite a lot of the rules obfuscate the phrase too much or too little. But about a third of them seem reasonable. Still some days to go.. ;-)

Thanks! Yeah, I firmly believe that btc value will increase by 800% a year on average, for the next couple of years, like it did for the last four. :-)
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:01:26
Man would your attitude be different had you won the gamble. You would feel smart about having gambled, wouldn't you.
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:13:27
There we have it. The US Govt infiltrated the Bitcoin Foundation.
The goal here could well be to undermine Bitcoin itself as a currency and to push something establishment-controlled instead. By integrating Realcoin with the ATMs of the country it could quickly overtake Bitcoin in adoption. If the masses start to use Realcoin, there will be much less incentive to switch to Bitcoin. Imho this could become a serious threat for the Bitcoin ecosystem. I don't like the idea, but this could be the banksters' answer to Bitcoin. Watch out.

That there is a public API is maybe not so obvious after all.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:49:22
I doubt anyone could help you. Sorry for your losses. As an advice: Never use the same password for two accounts on the internet.

- buy high and sell low. 
- keep too many coins on an exchange. you do not control those coins, but have to trust the exchange.
- keep too many coins in a hot storage. your pc might get compromised and your coins could get stolen.
- learn about bitcoin.
- learn about tools to keep your coins safe, use them. 
- lean back, relax.
