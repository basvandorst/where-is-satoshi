Purchased from coinbase with debit on the 6th, they charged me but the bitcoin deposit is still pending. Debit purchases are supposed to be instant, and my card has been charged. This isnt my first buy or anything, and i just did a test buy and it worked totally fine.
has anyone else had this problem?

honestly as long as i get what i paid for its not the biggest deal, its just impossible to get through to support

Paper wallet maybe? You should probably keep a copy of the key in case they lose it or whatever

I️ bought some on Wednesday using a debit card, which is supposed to be deposited instantly, but it’s still pending. The charge went through on my card but still no coins. I️ wonder what’s up with that

Its the price you bought at with Coinbase. It confirms with you # BTC @ $$$$$

Ive purchased before on debit and it transferred instantly, just did a small $10 buy to test it, and that one went through instantly. As it sits now ive been fucked out of a couple hundred collars. Hopefully coinbase support gets back to me, but from what i hear that may take a while

they're not the same. A hardware wallet will cost you some money,($70ish maybe?).
you can make a paper wallet using electrum by setting up a new wallet and writing the seed down. Give your sister the paper with the seed, keep a copy for yourself just in case sometime in the next 15-18 years they lose the one you gave them, you can still have it for when the kid grows up.

You can buy bitcoin directly from coinbase. Ive done it multiple times without issue, but for some reason this time i got fucked.
