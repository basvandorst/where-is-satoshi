you make so many wrong assumptions, it hurts.


suuure. Can't even buy alpaca socks with LTC...


Each BTC Service that deals with buying/selling BTC will need to hold BTC (even just temporary)


Just like BTC will do that (BTC, you know, the one that actually buys you alpaca socks!)


not possible. 2 transactions = 12 confirmations = ~2 hrs
Off-chain transaction services will boost confirmation time, and these services will need to hold BTC.


And what if I (or several people at the same time) want to move more than $21,000,000 ?


Total market cap: $ 7,197,463,289
BTC market cap: $ 5,801,635,117
spreaded much...?

Having SatoshiDICE transactions on your business address is maybe not the most professional thing ;-)

BTC is the fucking magic internet money of the FUTURE, and all those ATMs look like some weird post boxes or soda machines...

There was panic selling, triggering a lot of margin calls, lost connection to Bitstamp, so the relatively thin internal orderbook of BFX was wiped out down to 100. If they didn't halt the trading engine, the price would have plummeted to zero, losing a lot of lenders money (according to BFX staff on Bitcointalk:  So they halted it (but for too long), and price climbed back up. So ppl who got open shorts couldn't close them around ~550. Those people are likely to be refunded.

"That money" is then multiplied by ten (banks only need a reserve of 10% of the money they loan out) and lent to an individual, collecting interest on thin-air-money from the debtor. It is a redistribution of wealth, from the debtor to the bank.
