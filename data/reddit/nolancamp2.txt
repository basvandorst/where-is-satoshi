That doesn't change anything. You only make money on bitcoins if you sell them. And for that to happen, someone has to buy them. That makes it a zero-sum game.
Say you buy a rental property for $100,000. Later, the value of the property drops down to $90,000. You lost $10,000 right? No! Maybe you made $50,000 collecting rent off tenants in that time. You don't ever need to sell your property to make money, it's an investment that generates passive income. Bonds and stocks generate passive income as well. Substitute the property with a bitcoin, and yes you absolutely have made a loss.
The value of bitcoin cannot keep increasing forever; at some point it must level out or crash. It would make no sense to hold it then; the only way it can be profitable is through speculation, and hoping that someone will buy it off you.
Here is some fantastic advice from Warren Buffett on sound investment:

Listen, the bitcoins are not an investment. When you buy a $100,000 rental property, you no longer include $100,000 cash in your portfolio, it is replaced by the investment property. If you lend out 100 bitcoins, the bitcoins are not part of your portfolio, the loan is.
Holding bitcoins is like holding American dollars. It is not an investment, but you can purchase investments with them.

The thing is: trading bitcoins is a zero-sum game. For someone to make $100, others have to lose $100. Bitcoins don't generate income. A bond or stock or rental property does act as a source of income and generates cash flow.

Yes there is a difference. You don't possess the money you lend out. If the debtor defaults on the loan your money is gone. If you have an asset worth $10 it is not the same as having a $10 bill.

Bitcoins are not investments, they're a medium of exchange (a currency) and/or an instrument for speculation (buying and hoping for an increase in price).
If you want to actually invest, then you must buy assets that produce passive income. The most common way to do this is via stocks and bonds. A diversified portfolio of index funds (assortments of stocks/bonds) can, and has historically averaged an 8% return per year. These are the bases of most investment accounts and retirement funds.
Here are some resources you can use for more information.

No more than you can invest in Canadian dollars or Euros. That's not investing, it's speculating. There is a difference.

Buffet is right, though. So is Bill. Bitcoin is a great technological innovation. It is a medium of exchange, useful for conversions and payments, but without intrinsic value.

In which case you no longer are holding bitcoins, but are instead holding an income producing asset (a loan, essentially a bond). The bitcoins are not an investment, but the asset you purchase with them is. You can also loan out American dollars for interest (such as through a bond), but American dollars themselves are not investments.

I mean "intrinsic value" only in the strictest sense, as I believe, does Buffett: backed by physical or legal value.
