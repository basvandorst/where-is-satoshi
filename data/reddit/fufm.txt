Overstock throwing up a Hail Mary on an ostensibly unproven side of the business based on their private beliefs, selling the retail side of their business. Despite today’s rally, the YTD stock price is still down by nearly 70%.

The issue is that we are unable to achieve absolute zero. As a result, the slightly higher temperatures that bodies are preserved at cause irreparable cell damage, making it unlikely that anyone could be “brought back” even if the technology were to arise to heal someone with ALS or cancer or whatever the case may be.

Overstock = the CEO and interests of the company. Not the retail business that will be sold, despite it sharing the same name. Don’t get tied up in semantics.

Vitrification of an entire human body has never been accomplished. I don’t even think an entire human organ has ever been successfully vitrified.
