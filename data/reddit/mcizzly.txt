Asking this question in this subreddit is like going to r/clopclop and asking if you should buy a ponytail buttplug. If you are truly interested in learning whether or not this is a good idea, go ask a bunch of people who think bitcoin is stupid.

If you are buying bitcoin then you are probably assuming it will continue to gain value. Under that logic every day that you don't buy bitcoin your are losing an opportunity to buy it at its cheapest. In reality nobody can predict what's going to happen to the price of bitcoin after the fork therefore you should always buy as soon as possible if you believe bitcoin is on an upwards trend

Not because of this fork, but if you believe that coinbase is open to hacking then you are technically always at risk keeping your BTC on an online wallet

Please stop these all time high posts

Technically yes, but if the network is unusable (and nobody wants to buy your coins) that means that these free coins are worthless

Thank you for that sub suggestion, I had no idea it existed.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:15:01
You'll be fine, if you're holding over 10k though I'd suggest moving to a hardware wallet

I think its good to have some opposing theory in this subreddit instead of ATH spamming and shitting on other coins, so good for you for posting
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:44:54
That's interesting, didn't know that! Still don't trust em though
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:43:35
For the love of god yes, ATH posts should result in bans.

Could be wrong but if they clear before the fork then you will technically have 2 coins, if they clear after you will just have BTC

Your bank shouldn't really have a problem with it as long as you're transparent about what you're doing. Nothing illegal about selling bitcoins and transferring the money to your account. That being said, yes only sell as much as you need IMO. Taxed as capital gains in your case (hooray!)

better than the risk of not getting in early enough

Hopefully the difference between buying at 3k and buying at 6k will mean close to nothing in 5-10 years
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:17:48
Yeah don't use coinbase if you want anonymity

If you are not comfortable with your 4000 going to absolute zero then I would not recommend investing in BTC. Bitcoin has a tremendous possible upside but it also has the potential to completely destruct, something that not a lot of people like to acknowledge but it is a distinct possibility. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will go up, but I am betting a significant amount that it will. If you are comfortable with the fact that a bitcoin may be worthless someday but it also may be worth 25k+ in the next 5 years then you should buy now, don't wait for a dip because no one knows for sure what the next big dip or spike will be. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of crap.
