if you need to take a loan for 6k , then please think about how long you need to pay it back in case you loose the half or more of it...
Is it worth it ? How old are you if i might ask ?

If you want to mine for the first time i can recommend you Vertcoins "One Click Miner". Check out it's Reddit if you need help...people are pretty friendly and helpful in there... Greetings!

oh my gosh do you mean my 4 days of gains are gone ? What a pyramid scheme, better all back the hell out of it...sadly we saw a lot of panic selling today... had that expirience myself once...never gonna do that mistake again

+1 would be interesting to know...always thought about it recently....maybe because its "beta" ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:12:34
yeah crazy....just saw the buy orders fill up like maniacs...fomo from dip buyers kicks in again
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:13
can we make the green guy Vertcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:22
I also did, just saved my initial fundings and only gamble with my wins...feels absolutely great!
But besides all the fun and love due to a few green candle sticks again, we could expirience a little trap there...
As said, i dont care anymore...hodling and swaping every now and then...have a great day everyone! Life without crypto investments would be way too boring

it depends on the amount of bitcoin you have and of course the price of bitcoin at the time you've spent the 100 USD buying it...if it was around 2013, well congratulations ! You just became a millionaire

As they mentioned stuff like "buy the dip" and "catch a falling knife" made me laugh...
let it fall, we'll rebuy in the Dippedi Dip!

Most people outside America wont even know what Fantasy Football is, but yes its nice to be part of such a hype, especially if you went through several dips already.

What if Bill Gates buys all the Bitcoins available and now a bitcoin goes away for 2.5 Million overnight ? 
Dont place any orders....dont short Bitcoin...just my two satoshis
Edit: Before anyone comes to explain that even Bill Gates cant buy them all... yes i know : )
