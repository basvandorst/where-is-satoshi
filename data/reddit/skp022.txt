Teach me your ways friend! My friends are crazy about new ICOs and I feel FOMO. Currently have 10 % invested into crypto with LTC and BTC leading the pack. Wife is more interested in having the rest of our assets as fiat and some into Wealthfront. Jumped in on August 2017 and puzzled as to how I should invest moving forward

Hey I just posted my screenshot of the $10 promo I received. Except in my case, I had to sell it along with the rest of my 2 BTC to pay rent.

On May 15, 2014, I signed up for Coinbase when they were giving a $10 promo to sign up. That 0.02226 "free" BTC is worth $434.07 @ 19,500 today. 
At the time, I researched and soaked up everything BTC. I invested my entire savings at the time and got 2 BTC. But then I became unemployed and had to sale it to pay rent.
Now I stay up late wishing I had borrowed money instead, since not HODL'ing became an expensive lesson that grows exponentially every month. I am cheering from the sideline and managed to get in to some great alts. but wow to hold my 2 BTC again! Or even the free 0.02226 BTC.
Just HODL people. relax. See you at $100,000 per BTC in 1 year!

Thank you friend! Forgive my ignorance but why does memory matter? You must have a lot of bitcoin ;)

How about Model T vs. the first model Trezor? I can't seem to find any good comparisons of the two
