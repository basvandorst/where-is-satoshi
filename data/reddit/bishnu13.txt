lol said during a week where it doubled in value. These days were crazy. Also bitcoin is not investments. It is like going to play blackjack as an investment.

What have you do for bitcoin other than circlejerk about it and buy as speculation? This is like buying amazon stock in 1996 and saying you are an early Internet adopter

I have all my money virtually in a bank. I rarely deal with cash. It is all digital now. I don't see how bitcoin is different from regular money online other than the anonymity which is only really good for sketchy shit.

It would have probably happened at every exchange to. I don't think you know how hard it is to write a highly available website. That with the fact that the panic created mass synchronization (everyone selling). It is no suprise it experience extreme lag. Every other exchange would have as well.

50% discount from when. The highwater mark of a price is not its value. 50% off from yesterday may really be 200% more than its final steady value.

This is good advice for a long term investment. Why is bitcoin a long term investment? What are its fundamentals? What changed between now and 2 months ago?

The issue is when a site is down that people really want to get on they just sit there and hit refresh a whole bunch. This means you have to sustain greater than their already elevated traffic for a short while until it somewhat normalizes again.
 
If they were brought down by the traffic before they would be brought down by the traffic again.
I doubt it is a real ddos because otherwise they could just find the type of common pattern to requests and filter them. I bet it is just real elevated traffic.

Why should bitcoins gain value? Where does it come from. Bitcoin is not like a business that you know grows and makes things. This is just pure asset speculation where speculation leads to more people investing which causes more returns which brings more people in and so on and so on. This is gambling pure and simple. There are no fundamentals for bitcoin. No non-shady infrastructure (MTGox could run with everyone's money).  This is MADNESS.

This is not a problem with real money, but with some credit card companies and banks. There is no reason they couldn't be overcome with other business. Also, they are mild cons that don't affect many people.
Bitcoin on the other hand is a niche currency which few people accept, very volatile, could very well become completely worthless or even illegal, and has to be exchanged to another currency to do almost anything with it.
Not hating on bitcoin as a currency though (it is great for silkroad!). However, all I am saying is that there is no reason why bitcoin should increase in value. There is no reason for growth. The only reason really is speculation that there will be other stupider speculators.
