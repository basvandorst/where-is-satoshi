@_date: 2018-08-20 16:55:40
I am in 90 % loss but I am relaxed because I know Bitcoin and Blockchain is future! 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:33:09
I respect him all i can say is that 
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:03:38
I agree to your point 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:52:04
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:55:52
waiting for the lightning network full implementation, then we can verify, lets wait and watch but i am sure bitcoin will become a better product in future !
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:28:39
Oaky :)
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:48:12
True, manipulation is in all markets. Manipulation is for short term price action and doesn't work in the long term perspective. So if we build right trading plan or strategies we can make informed decisions.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:19:47
Hey, the point you made about volatility is true &amp; what I think is the majority of people will save their money in stable coins in case of economic crisis. Stablecoins are the perfect options to safeguard the savings of people, but when these people would hold stable coins then they will definitely believe in BTC and they might save their money in BTC as well.    
Between the updated chart of Btc is here from mid-2018 to present -  [
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:04:50
Haha, true Bitcoin season is going on.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:47:18
Why do you think Semen?
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:24:03
You are 100% correct, Bitcoin is future but for the price point of view, we should have some patience and wait for the right time to accumulate it. But how we get to know the best price point?   
Always see major support and resistance and buy on a good support   
Do sentiment analysis - as now the major sentiment for Bitcoin is halving and we have seen in the past halving drives the price of Bitcoin.   
Always backtest the strategies [manually]( through Trading View or through [automation]( tool like SmartBotCoin on historical data to predict the future outcomes or you can say that will help you to make informed decisions.   
Play safe crypto is once a lifetime opportunity and always one should build their trading or investment plan.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:11:28
Can't really say. Maybe you are right or maybe not.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:12:33
Hey yes, I am paying all my capital gains. Any more advice? :D
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:56:01
its not about saying stuffs, 95 % coins dont have usecase 
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:29:20
Yeah, Nice for Novice traders. What do you think where dominance should go?
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:00:02
It's a historical chart for the analysis of BTC telling how Halving impacts BTC prices. But don't know if this trend will continue in the future or not. 
Between here is the new chart of BTC -  [
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:02:52
Same is my hobby and its a common problem all face it. In trading sometimes we make and sometimes we lose but what we can do is to minimize our chances of loss by trading in the right way for that we have to make a good trading plan that not only consists of good trading knowledge but also you should know to control your emotions. If you are a newbie I would suggest to use some [tool]( to make your strategies, to backtest data. After analyzing all the things you should trade with real money.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:52:18
Can't really say, but in 2020 we can see good gains.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:27:38
sure but when?
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:02:39
Yes and always build some strategies and do backtesting before going into live trade.
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:24:06
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:58:28
Yes, I agree both are equally important as both TA and FA goes hand in hand. A trader has to think with every angle and also should have a solid trading/investment plan. But whether it be [technicals]( or [fundamentals]( always one should backtest the strategies to minimize the loss in trading.
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:23:13
But what I know is sentiments also have a great role in the crypto market, we can't simply ignore it. Think if ETF approved we would see a massive jump in Bitcoin prices. Technical analysis and Sentiments analysis both are necessary to do in the crypto market. But it's hard to track the sentiments of all the social media manually so we can take help of Artificial Intelligence [tools]( that can gather all the news from trusted sources at one place and do sentiment analysis of particular coin.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:00:28
Market injected in the back of their elbows.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:43:45
Hey, you are right major bull market can be in 2021, what I was saying is we may see some good gains in 2020 in comparison to now. I actually backtested my strategies on historical data &amp; also done sentiment analysis through [automation]( and found the results that Bitcoin can see good gains in 2020 because halving is a big sentiment for the crypto enthusiasts that will drive the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:04:52
Yes, as I am investing properly, having a solid investment/trading plan is necessary.
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:03:44
Nice, Averaging your holdings is the best option.
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:37:10
Oh!! Satoshi Nakamoto have debt lol
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:35:56
Do you really think 75%? I am targeting like 80% BTC dominance.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:02:39
Why? you are not accumulating?
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:49:31
Why do you think so? I want to know the reason
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:48:44
But they will be rewarded in 2020.
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:19:11
What do you think leads the price?
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:55:54
Haha true as fuck!
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:27:37
nice icons really man , appreciate your work, thanks !
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:03:28
Yeah, it's not up to date. From mid-2018 to present you can see it from here-  [
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:07:14
Thanks for the update. Much Appreciated!
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:11:21
I am buying BTC and putting in that BTC into altcoins to gain more BTC, I don't see the dollar value I see how much BTC I have accumulated.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:49:58
Yeah, I guess you are also living a dream like mine. :D
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:35:32
True that and halving is a major sentiment for BTC right now.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:04:09
What's your target after halving?
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:30:39
I guess it's the right opportunity to invest. We are in a bear market from 1.5 years and it should not stretch more than 2-2.5 years. What do you say?
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:25:25
Yeah, maybe I wish his predictions go right always. :D
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:34:50

@_date: 2019-04-08 02:23:38
BTC adoption is real as BTC don't care about govt and regulations 
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:54:09

@_date: 2019-04-09 20:08:42
Mt Gox is really a mess from the last 2- 3 years market is being manipulated in the name of Mt Gox I don't understand when this matter will be resolved and now China also talking about banning bitcoin mining but you know what Bitcoin is king don't care about Mtgox and China banning lol
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:59:34
Yes i want medal give me
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:44:45
I don't think so
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:38:29
Always hardware wallets are best if you are storing for the long term and those who think 1BTC=1BTC

@_date: 2019-04-04 18:04:37
True :D mass adoption on the way.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:02:13
Lol sure every satoshi is important right now. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:57:02
Yes maybe. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:12:59
haha lol
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:35:29
How? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:38:25
with lightning network and many more developments to come bitcoin will have a widespread adoption globally just hodl for now
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:25:15
But for the real rally we have to cross 5800 dollars then only we can say about the bitcoin bull run, don't you think so?
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:37:17
Why Robinhood? bitcoin only dipped on Robinhood?
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:13:35

@_date: 2019-04-11 20:01:06
Don't care about bottom as what I know is 1 BTC=1BTC
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:28:58
Its a major resistance for now breaking it can create fear of missing out among retail investors.
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:29:17
50k dollar &amp; 1 million dollar maybe.

Hey, it's really a nice t-shirt, love this bitcoin ride 
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:40:38
I feel disappointed when these big companies like Facebook not supporting Bitcoin and discussing to make their own Facebook coin. 
I like Jack founder of Twitter openly coming up to support bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:12:42
Don't know who is holding private keys of Satoshi
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:20:26

Long way to go mate. just hodl 
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:11:43
Yes, maybe I found interesting and share with you guys to discuss.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:59:49
no crypto can really compete with bitcoin the only true decentralized currency.
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:57:54
Only Bitcoin bro :D
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:36:44

@_date: 2019-09-02 10:46:50
Great to know
@_date: 2019-09-04 12:33:34
Waiting for it to cross 19k dollars and I was performing backtest on historical data and found that it may cross before halving of Bitcoin. What do you think?
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:32:08
There is a hole in the first Bitcoin chocolate- probably someone tried to attack the chocolate. Is it Roger?
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:05:04
True Bitcoin died many times. But every time when it dies it bounces back strong lol.
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:33:56
I don't know whats the problem is with China - They have all the big Bitcoin miners and china always say we have banned Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies and uses and trade silently. China is the biggest manipulator in the crypto market.
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:29:56
Heading towards mass adoption!

@_date: 2019-05-10 19:58:48
Yes bitcoin is bullish again I think it will touch 7k dollars for now than possible can have retracements as history says before consensus by Coindesk bitcoin always increases the drop during and after consensus, let's see where it goes but yeah we have 5800 solid support for now.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:48:57
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:51:33
What will you choose between gold and bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:39:48
Nor 10k dollars and he will soon jump off from the cliff.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:04:13
yes, true, possible reason can be media hype and the conferences going on throughout the world.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:25:52
And what's next after the moon?
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:16:02
Hi but if anyone says you have to choose between gold &amp; bitcoin then what will you choose?
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:49:32
You are my man.
