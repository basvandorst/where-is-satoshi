Coinbase has now opened up *free buying up of Bitcoin until July 5th (11:59 Pacific time) for many countries in Europe*: **Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.** 
**Here's a thought worth seriously considering:** With a little of a PR push in the direction of Greece and other European countries, we might get to witness a massive adoption of Bitcoin in a relatively short time. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:48:09
I agree the alternative is worse. Hell, if Greece were to leave, their economy will go down the tubes. 
The key issue in the short-term will be who controls the narrative. If Greece is seen as an underdog standing up to the Troika for its own autonomy, to experience economic empowerment, or whatever creative spin their propaganda machine can churn out, then expect for other's to follow suit. Put another way, the point that I am trying to make is that it would be in the best interest for the people of economically vulnerable economies to objectively view their options and not get sucked in the hysteria of thinking leaving the EU is a good idea considering their circumstances. But history shows us that objectivity doesn't always reach the minds of the people until it's too late.
We shouldn't underestimate the personal impact of experiencing austerity measures. Take Spain, for example: Highly educated population, rich history and culture, but an official unemployment rate hovering around 25%. After awhile, being told "austerity is for your own good" no matter how true it is for a countries health gets old. This becomes pronounced if you lack the professional skills or resources to leave your homeland for better opportunities abroad. People will ultimately want a change, and change comes much sooner when they feel desperate with an easy alternative.

The Winkdex more or less averages out the price of bitcoin across multiple exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 01:13:42
If Greece does impact the price of Bitcoin, it will be an indirect effect or a catalyst for things to come. 
Should Greece default and decides to leave the Euro, then it would be expected that political parties similar to the government running Greece (Anti-Austerity) will gain further political traction and legitimacy in places such as Spain and Portugal. 
From there, the ECB will be under tremendous pressure to maintain the stability of their financial system. It should be expected that the average European will begin to question banking practices at large in their countries. Moreover, the media may begin to apply further scrutiny to banks, the monetary policies of various individuals within the banking/finance sector, government officials, etc. 
I see adoption and a modest price hike (at least in the beginning) taking place in the following scenarios: 
* Investors/speculators will begin to make more obvious purchasing of Bitcoin in anticipation for a media frenzy linking Bitcoin as an alternative way for individuals to protect some of their wealth. I think we're beginning to see this narrative materialize, but the message is not directly targeted to the affected populations just yet.  
* From there, individuals from negatively affected countries (middle-to-upper middle, upper class) will acquire bitcoin as a means to take their money out of their countries. 
*As an aside, a friend of mine, who happens to be from Greece, was telling me of the troubles of taking money out of the country the first time everyone thought Greece would leave the European Union. According to him, he noticed that Customs Officers aggressively searched Greeks leaving the country to ensure that no one was taking massive amounts of money out of the country. Fast forward to today: Bitcoin would clearly serve as a good means to circumvent drawing the immediate ire of the authorities in Greece.*
* A organic push from Greek bloggers speaking on Bitcoin (you can bet your ass that you will not hear any positive mention of Bitcoin in the Greek mainstream media, **especially right now**). 
Should things go sour (capital controls, so on) then it would be plausible to expect for people to have an ever-growing suspicion of state-backed currency of their respective country. 
* A market will begin to grow allowing the Average Greek to protect some of their wealth (similar to whats occurring in Argentina) in the small, but growing local bitcoin economy. 
The key to drive adoption for economies like this is for people to feel the urgent impact of having a weak, and hyper-inflated currency in their lands. Bitcoin is the better alternative, however, the word needs to get out to the people according to their needs and the solution must be as clear as day. As it stands now, Bitcoin has little awareness in Greece. 
Who knows, maybe some enterprising Greek is reading this and is thinking of ways to advance the bitcoin agenda for his or her country. ; )
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:07:18
Expect for the search volume to increase as there are more mentions of Bitcoin in the press. Who knows, perhaps the social media outreach efforts of the Greece Bitcoin drop may actually spark some interest within the country. I remain skeptical of significant large price movements directly culminating from Greece as smart money left the country a while back. This doesn't discount the indirect effect of causing neighboring countries to see the writing on the wall, however.  
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:10:39

I was caught in the middle an Anti-Austerity protest in Madrid a few years ago, and even then the tension at Puerto de Sol could be cut with a butter knife. Should Greece leave the Euro, expect to see Anti-Austerity movements and their members increase by orders of magnitude.

It's much better to be on the safe side. Those who are smart will begin to see that it's certainly worth their while to buy bitcoin in Europe. I can say the same thing for many people around the world. If it continues, we will see a massive surge in Bitoin adoption in a short time. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:30:13
I understand the position of the EU in their reluctance to provide Greece ELA especially if there aren't noticeable structural reforms, much less commitments to make changes to the Greek economy. In a fair world, EU would continue on without them. However, the reality we face is that if Greece decides to leave the EU, then other countries may follow in their path. Anti-Austerity movements will be seen as a way to combat the 'big bully Troika' in the same form as the Greeks, at least in the short-term.
The issue for EU is to retain its political identity and legitimacy by somehow propping up Greece, or see their own system face both an existential and economic crisis.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:02:42

A lot of people haven't mentioned China for some strange reason. Including the media. How can we miss it? China is currently undergoing the transition to a stock market crash and the beginning stages of a bear market. Chinese capital needs to sit somewhere. I would not be surprised if the narrative of the Greece community adopting bitcoin serves as adequate enticement for Chinese money to enter Bitcoin in a huge way.
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:05:45
I'm of the opinion this would motivate populations in countries who have their own anti-austerity movements to grow in number and influence. Spain and Portugal's economy is crippled and the people feel that they are suffering as a result of austerity measures. Spain has an election coming up later this year, with a number of anti-austerity leaders campaigning for a political seat. Greece could be an example to their European mates.  
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:48:44

I tend to believe we are still very much at the late stages of the innovator phase. Only now has large investment firms, stock exchanges, and other reputable orgs in the financial space begun to explore and put money into the bitcoin ecosystem. To add, regulatory bodies have yet to finalize their legal stance and treatment of bitcoin. By the time bitcoin truly reaches to the right of the bell curve of adoption, the negative associations of bitcoin due to misinformation and ignorance will be long gone.

Not to be rude, but I read intently until he mentioned Litecoin. To be sure, I didn't miss an important point hidden somewhere, I double-read to ensure he mentioned Litecoin and the context. Here's why I do not take the price swings seriously with Litecoin: 
1. Litecoin is at best a speculative alt-coin. 
2. No serious infrastructure investment has been made to this currency unlike Bitcoin (the eventual payment rail for the internet and the world) or Bitcoin 2.0 projects (aiming to apply the blockchain to decentralize other industries that are intermediary-rich).
Litecoin is pretty much being pumped and manipulated right now. I recommend reading Jesse Livermore's account of the pre-regulated stock market in the 20th Century for anyone interested to hear of tales in the early Wall Street days. It will help you to identify when manipulation is done. The current and previous alt-pumps are reminiscent of the 20th Century.

Oh, I know a bit about that situation. Although I am not married, I am in similar boat. I have told some close friends about bitcoin and other tech that can be taken seriously for the future and have encountered polite listening. But at least in some years bitcoin and its related tech have a solid shot of reaching mainstream consciousness and then it will click for them then. 
Anyway, your approach to your idea will need to be tailored to your background. If you have a business background like me, perhaps attending some bitcoin meet-ups in your city/town may help to get to know the local tech and investor community. From there, begin to recruit to build a team, develop a wireframe version of the app, get some seed money, so on. Ideas come a dime a dozen, but execution is what matters most.   
But if your idea is what you believe warrants a consultation with an intellectual property lawyer, you may want to have a demonstrable prototype and well-researched documentation to back-up your idea. 
Good luck.

Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy. 
The day will come when most of the general public will have a fairly informed opinion of Bitcoin, and how to use it, but by then, perhaps they'll be thinking to the right of the decimal point rather than the left. 
The key issue many people suffer when it comes to wrapping their minds around a technology like bitcoin is what I'd like to call a necessary de-coupling of money away from one's state. 
Let's face it: All our lives we've been programmed to think that the only viable money is that deriving its power from the state, and anything else deviating from this course should not be taken seriously. In fact, I'm sure most of us also had to challenge our own preconceived notions of money before taking bitcoin seriously. Having said that, PR will need to be geared to educate the public of what money is or at the very least explain that money has evolved with the advent of bitcoin in the internet age. 
When it comes to decentralization, I think this issue is mainly a concern of the educated crowd. Not many people will be concerned about models of decentralization models nor should they. The burden of companies utilizing decentralized models will be in finding compelling use-cases for the general public to try a new way of doing things without the invasion of privacy that has become so commonplace nowadays. Extrapolating from the recent John Oliver interview with Edward Snowden, I think the general public will begin to question things--or at least be concerned about their info--in the coming years. Give it time.

Acquisitions for start-ups normally happen after businesses have demonstrated a viable business model. A second condition that increases the likelihood of a company being acquired is when incumbent corps begin to see and/or sense their market share decreasing. 
Incumbents may also set their sights on company acquisitions when an established player notices a viable business model they'd like to pivot into/reduce the threat they poise as an independent entity. Normally, the acquired companies key staff continue on in their roles but under the umbrella of the company which conducted the acquisition. 
That said, it's still too early to speculate what bitcoin companies will be acquisition targets. Moreover, acquisitions will likely occur in the bitcoin space once adoption levels have teetered on the brink of the early majority stage.

In addition, I do believe that ideas hold tremendous value, but how have you "battle tested" the idea to even see a market opportunity for said killer app?
I really think the killer app for bitcoin will be ubiquitous hardware and software facilitating bitcoin storage (wallets that are virtually impossible to hack and are so easy that an idiot can use it) and obtainment (e.g., lending out spare internet and being paid for it via mesh networks) by simply running their computer and/or electronic device.

I find your argument steeped in naivete. You're right that there elements in which religions are used for nefarious means--history rightly proves this fact. However, to suggest that religions will be eliminated due to bitcoin in the future is a foolish argument. You've gotta admit *most* people need to believe in something. Whether it is the man in the sky, some being who rose from the dead, or any other narrative that dominates most mainstream religions. Bitcoin will not supplant this common human need. Even if Bitcoin saturates every facet of the global economy, religions will be around, although they may evolve to fit the context of their environment. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 15:05:21


 
The meaning was implied with the comment "bitcoin hastening the removal process." Or did I misunderstand your comment?
Religion is a need for many people. Strip away elements of ulterior motives and agendas behind religions being abused by the elite of the past, and you will see that all cultures have embraced some form of religion. In fact, according to many anthropologists, the creation of a religion denotes the advancement of a primitive culture into a moderately advanced one. It's akin to the development of art, dance, and other acts of expression germinating from the collection of a fairly large populace with stability. No brainwashing or indoctrination is needed for the development or creation of a religion (although the argument can be made it could be a driver, albeit a sick one).   
On another note: If we look at the creation of bitcoin, we see the formation of a newly emerging internet society.

The internet is a platform that has connected the world more than ever before.

If anything, Bitcoin may help to evolve structures of governmental rule, the concept of borders and nationality, and the like.

You're right that the market cap doesn't need an injection of $97 Billion to increase near the $100 Billion capitalization mark. But even $1 Billion is not enough for bitcoin's price to reach its ATH. At current bitcoin prices, an injection of $1 Billion when assuming that said injection will not be offset significantly by more sell pressure, would increase the price of each bitcoin to around $431 (83%). This is no where near late Nov 2013's prices.

Just because you may disagree with with the value of religion does not  warrant the assertion that religions are scams. In addition, you should err on the side of caution.

As someone who has studied supply chain management at the graduate-level, I can totally see a project such as this exceed. Especially when you consider the burden consumers and suppliers alike have in ensuring the authenticity of the products obtained and their origins. The challenge will be of course on-boarding 3rd party verification companies and the companies involved, but that's something they can easily do from a CSR-related position.

In my opinion, your question is difficult to answer as the last bitcoins are expected to be mined sometime around 2140. If answering your question as a thought experiment: Assuming that bitcoins remain a solid store of value, and the bitcoin protocol is still utilized, then we should expect for even everyday electronics of the future to run a bitcoin node and to support the bitcoin ecosystem. If this were the case, then bitcoin would be very much embedded into every facet of the financial system of the next century.

Assuming that the Russians in your example understood what bitcoin entailed along with foreseeing the Ruble falling in value as it has now, then the obvious answer would be that many would buy into bitcoin with the guarantee provided.
I'm excited to see the value of bitcoin in the future. It personally reminds me of my days in emerging markets during the recession and witnessing the steps various governments took to recover and create positive sentiment on investing again. 
Think about it: we have some some of the largest equity markets entering into the bitcoin space, billionaires speaking positively on it, and governments around the world analyzing the bitcoin protocol. 
Just my personal opinion, and this should in no way be interpreted as investor advice, but I think many people of the future will be jealous to have missed the boat on bitcoin.

Transaction volume can "half" for a number of reasons: 
1. A sudden rise in value of a particular cryptocurrency which would encourage users to hodl said currency. 
2. The number of altcoins losing significant market capital as its users shift to more viable platforms and protocols in the cryptospace. 
3. The volatility that was rampant in 2014 of many cryptocurrencies settles, thereby leaving daytraders and speculators to look for other opportunities to make quick short-term profit. 
4. The perception of cryptocurrencies in the public slowly shifting from a quick-profit means to an alternative, but fairly reliable, store of value. 
5. Individuals begin to understand the counterparty risks associated with trading on non-regulated exchanges and slowly shift to exchanges that must comply with strict regulatory standards.

The author got it wrong, and it was frankly a lazy conclusion on his part, since correlation does not prove causation. Some of rapid rise of bitcoin could be attributed to QE, but most people who follow bitcoin closely know the rise was a result of the artificial trading bots operating within Mt. Gox.

I think I read somewhere that Nas had invested alongside Tom Draper on a bitcoin startup.
Edit: The name of the startup is called Blockcypher. Link:

I don't think this deal should be understated. Soon, bitcoin will be receiving very favorable press coverage. This is awesome.

How soon should we realistically expect for the current blocksize to increase and what steps are necessary to ensure that miners are compliant in the proposed soft fork by Gavin Andresen?

I took the bait and clicked on the link. Initially, I thought to myself, ''Great, theaudience are beginning to work their PR magic on the general public." 
However, her reference of bitcoin in the interview made absolutely no sense at all.

I think I may hold for at least 10 years. By then, I will be considered either a very bold and rich man, or an idiot serving as a cautionary tale. 
It's really a binary outcome and the potential reward is well worth it in my opinion.

I think the writing is on the wall that there will need to be some major changes underway for the banking industry as more people are learning about their practices and new emerging technologies are seeking to disrupt the status quo.   As an aside, I believe fiat will still be around in 10 years, but I also think the common layman will be semi-conversant on what bitcoin entails. By then, who knows, owning a single bitcoin may be considered expensive.

I agree that bitcoin stands a chance to significantly rise in value, I just don't think it's reasonable to place a timeline on the expected rise within a one year time horizon. It will take longer in my opinion. During the last major bubble, we saw a market cap at $10 Billion with a price of each bitcoin a bit over $1100. With a simple calculation, the market cap would need to be over $100 Billion. So, in a years time, I doubt we'll see the market cap increase by $97 Billion (as the current market cap is more or less $3 Billion). In order for bitcoin to reach $10K or higher, regulatory frameworks have to mature to order to onboard more institutions from the legacy financial system. This may take at least 5 years.

And if your IP address is the same as before, then it doesn't count. Try a VPN, DuckDuckGo, or a different search engine as a rough litmus test on what comes up for Bitcoin on the 1st page.

Bitcoin now appears to be undergoing an ideological makeover from its libertarian origins. With fairly positive coverage featuring the potential of Bitcoin and its  blockchain and protocol from mainstream media outlets, to Wall Street Journal authors writing a favorable book on the promise of bitcoin, to supportive regulatory frameworks materializing, I think it is clear that we're seeing the PR treatment necessary to get the mainstream interested participating in the bitcoin ecosystem (and perhaps, even an ETF). Smart money has invested a sizable amount into bitcoin startups, now its time to raise public awareness to eventually see a return on their money.
