Lol if you think merchants will pass the savings down to consumers, you're flat out nuts.  Merchants charge the most they can get away with, period.  You think those $60 jeans made in China cost anything near $60 to make and ship to that department store?  Hell no, that's most people will pay before they say shop elsewhere.  Besides, 9 times out of 10 bitcoin is clunky for paying for stuff and slower than credit cards, paypal, or WU.

Yea the bitcoin wiki is probably the last place I would go to find factual information about bitcoin.  The theoretical maximum for bitcoin is 7 tps, the reality of the situation is that transactions are always larger than what would allow for a theoretical maximum to happen.  Given the current size of the transactions today, the actual network throughput it somewhere between 2.5 and 3 transactions per second.

Western Union: 28 transactions per second. (average)
Paypal: 58 transactions per second. (average)
Visa: 56,000 transactions per second (maximum) 2,000 (average)
Bitcoin: 3 transactions per second (maximum)

How it works behind the scenes does not matter for consumers what so ever. I do not care if my visa transaction settles for the merchant that day, the next, or the following year.  I swipe my card and leave.  Seeing as how consumers are the people that would potentially mass adopt bitcoin, I don't see how settlement time is relevant.

Gosh was that after the house got raided or was that after they suspended the sale of gift cards due to the gift cards later being canceled by Amazon because they were purchased with stolen credit cards?  It's so hard to keep up with purse.io scams and fraud these days.  It was definitely BEFORE they were hacked and all user balances drained which was later completely denied and left unexplained by purse.io.  Just trying to help with the timeline of events here...

Moving to a Roger Ver controlled forum is a terrible idea.  Look [at this post]( .... is just another theymos.  He doesn't give a fuck what you or the community think, he does what is best for himself.
