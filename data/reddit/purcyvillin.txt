are Opendime bitcoin "sticks" on Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:47:41
Would now be a good time to swap ETC for BTC? Or should I wait? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:31:13
Ive never used Localbitcoins service &amp; was wondering if its legit? I know its listed on the FAQs and it probably wouldnt be if there were alot of issues surrounding it, but could y'all shed some light on that experience (for those who have used it) or why its not a good idea? Is the online option better than meeting in person? Thanks

all the exchanges  have BTCs price above 11,7 but coinbase is selling it for ~300/400 less... why the discrepancy? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:19:06
I wonder what percentage of the crypto market is actually: 1.New-comers, who haven't done the necessary research 2.Buying in with funds they can't afford to lose
3.Panic selling because of 1. + 2. have caught up with them
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:13:20
Go trick on the corner and put it all back into BTC for your penance 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:05:16
Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:21:02
Thank you! I figured that was the way to go about it but I just wasn't sure if it was that easy. Appreciate the response.

I would be deducting from my net wages then going through bit wage. Since my paycheck has already been taxed, that should be the end o of it right? Unless of course I accrue bitcoin, it skyrockets and then I’d pay capital gains. But it seems like a way to circumvent txn taxes through exchanges and Coinbase...
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:52:47
I don't want anyone to make my decision for me, but like I said- so many of the folks on these forums, I fell, are more knowledgeable than I am on the topic and It'd be nice to hear a reasons for or against or experience people have in having done the same decision.
  Do you feel there is an advantage to how you have your holdings set up or is that just how it happened? Is it structured around your hopes for how you want the future of the crypto space to look?
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:04:13
Helps enormously. Thanks for explaining it to me
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:49:20
Does anyone have any experience working a standard job but getting some of their direct deposit sent to bitwage?
looking for some general reviews... 
also does anyone know how this plays into taxes?  
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:30:44
is a good UI really difficult to develop and deploy? I feel like its the only thing standing between coinbase and anyone out there who wants to compete...
gemini for example could really benefit here.

Thanks for this. Best of luck to you

So why is it here?
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:04:16
You always hear about these Alt-coin projects and the team behind it who are going to make it the next best project. The reason for someone to invest is usually the vision of the project and the team backing it. Does Bitcoin in general have a core group of developers or a team "backing it" ? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:45:46
   So it’s increasingly unlikely that tether is worth 1:1 and when this is realized the exchanges trading against tether will not allow withdrawals in an effort to mitigate their losses? And the users of those exchanges are screwed as they watch their investment price plummeting?
    And now that tether has hopped in bed with Madoff and Associates, that supposed to be a good thing? Because that’s what the markets are reflecting...
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:28:54
they didn't even include stickers or those cool bitcoin socks- the only two items I actually have. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:37:40
where do you bet bitcoin futures? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:11:24
spot on
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:40:48
Should I consolidate my entire position into BTC and get out of the alt-coin game? I've seriously considered doing this for a couple of weeks now. The reddit community has been great and a lot of you guys are really intelligent (more than i could hope to be). I'm making the decision tomorrow and if any of you feel like voicing an opinion for or against, regarding the aforementioned strategy please feel free. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:18:48
“Money needs trust. Public currencies, for example the euro, have the backing of public institutions such as the ECB.”
Translation: Public currencies aren’t backed by shit
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:50:23
That’s a good point, i didn’t consider it. BTC is up 4.4% so that could account for the difference when you add the tether factor to the mix...
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:42:58
Explain to my dumbass what this means please?
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:30:18
Perks o belonging to a small private bank.
And as my parents say- everyone needs to know and hold a good relationship with a banker. I don’t pay any fees simply by taking their advice. 
I’m worried my bank is going to get bought by a larger one and implement policy against crypto. In which case I’d take my business elsewhere 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:47:26
whats going on?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:11:29
lets say i have my btc on a ledger nano s and currently on legacy, how do i go about switching them over to segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:51:20
    You are correct in regards to ease of start- Coinbase bar none, however easy isn’t always the best way, it certainly isn’t a prerequisite to starting off either. 
   So you might have to spend a bit of time learning a way to circumvent Coinbase but I’d bet dollars to dimes that after you did so, you’d be better informed and more confident about moving forward in this game.

@_date: 2017-12-23 20:40:10
����This is wrong. When it’s game time, Coinbase it not the team to be on! 
   He/she will be sitting there with an error message about suspended services or “routine” maintenance when we all know Coinbase can’t handle volume spikes and isn’t interested in their customer support. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:46:37
It’s criminal. Look up something called “policy capture” it will really put thing into perspective. Money is it’s own form of free speech and can’t be curtailed therefore huge corporations can lobby to get law passed in their favor and round and round we go.

Idk what they said about it in 2014, I just know they’re not in the business of making statements without considering their endgame. And when is comes to their stake in bitcoin- any mention of it is to get a market reaction in favor of their current position. Anyone simple enough to take a statement in this kind context with such a cut and dry interpretation needs to go home.

Let’s say one wanted to start peddling crypto swag- making hats and all kinds of stuff with designs on it that bear various coin/tokens...
 What’s the legal repercussions if any? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:16
You would think with all those fees Coinbase has they would at least be able to handle their business. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:29:07
    I think you should do more research and formulate your investment strategy or define it (what you’re interested in, how much you can afford to throw in the game, WHY you are investing in this tech) and as a result you will know more about how to move forward. 
Not trying to be disheartening but you should be more informed than you come off. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:52:12
   Google “diffusion of innovation” you should see a chart with a bell curve on it. I think it’s safe to assume the whole bitcoin game is still in the innovators phase. This means you have plenty of time to get back into the game and make some good things happen for yourself. Maybe take a look at some new projects and start getting into some altcoins...
   As for the personal stuff, it’s important to keep confidence in yourself. You’ll be okay, just keep your flak jacket on and take it one day at a time.

If youre currently employed and paid via direct deposit you can use the services of Bitwage to reallocate x% of your net income every month to be converted into BTC
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:19:56
Go to their website and find your way to their "Invoicing" service (the one you are interested in) and there should be some info on that in their FAQs or further down the page you arrive at.

your money would be better spent on buying the dip than counseling, its gone south before- to the tune of 70% but it climbs back up every time. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:23:20
You cant go wrong owning Bitcoin, no matter how small your purchase increments may be. Most people will never own a entire Bitcoin in my opinion- especially if major investors start buying it up, which seems to more and more of a reality with each day. Buy Bitcoin, hodl, &amp; dont look back.

If the major financial actors decide that cryptocurrency is the way forward, they have the resources to create their own digital asset and push it onto the uneducated population which will be eager to accept it simply because they are ignorant in regards to the technology, and the capabilities/vulnerabilities of it. Don’t forget we are the minority in all this.

Is it against the rules to give away a new Ledger Nano S in this sub? Was going to make a post but figured I should ask first. Got my genesis block edition Nano X in and already have a few Nano S Wallets so to show my appreciation for this sub and all I was going to post a give away. It’s still shrink wrapped and all. Good idea, bad idea?
