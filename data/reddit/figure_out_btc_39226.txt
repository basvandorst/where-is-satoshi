I don't think the average Joe has enough confidence in Bitcoin today to store their wealth into the crypto-currency, at least I know I don't and I consider myself rather average. As of today, the banks and fiat still rule (relative to Bitcoin at least).
Sure, things could change in the future and Bitcoin becomes a serious threat to the banks. But banks have lots of very smart people working for them, I wouldn't be surprised if they develop their own blockchain based technology that's more appealing to the average person than Bitcoin.

Edit (Another reveal of Andreas' investment approach to cryptocurrencies): 
Edit 2: From  
"The latter part of Antonopoulos’ statement is what most investors in the cryptocurrency market fails to consider. **The entire cryptocurrency market is still at an early stage, and most cryptocurrencies remain extremely volatile. Hence, investors should not be investing more than they are willing to lose, especially if their investment is experimental and speculative.**"

Right, gold itself as an element has value/useful properties beyond being money. So from that perspective it would be easier to convert gold to fiat than it would be to convert bitcoin to fiat under a government not friendly to cryptocurrencies.
It would be harder to outright ban gold or silver because various industries need them, but how many industries can't live without cryptocurrencies? Not many I suspect.

But do most Bitcoin holders **want** to spend it? I suspect most hoard their Bitcoins and hope to sell them to someone else for a nice profit in fiat. Unless someone can paint for me a different vision for Bitcoin's future, I don't see it being being widely adopted as currency. 
Right now Bitcoin is being treated more like an asset being traded around for fiat than a currency that stands by itself. I don't see that changing anytime soon.

I've seen more than enough instances of all-or-nothing thinking in this subreddit recently when it comes to putting money into bitcoin. One example I've read is of some guy putting his life savings of $100k into bitcoin. Sure, he could strike it rich in a few years, but what's wrong with a little risk management?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:15:35
I hope that the money you convinced your parents to put into Bitcoin is money they can afford to lose. Even Bitcoin experts like Andreas Antonopoulos advises people to put into Bitcoin only what they can afford to lose. Otherwise, what you did was very irresponsible.
Anyways, I wish you and your parents all the best.

Were you using stop loss orders to manage your risks?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:15:03


Does that mean one doesn't have to deposit money into Bitstamp first before you can trade cryptocurrencies in the exchange? Funds can be accessed straight from the personal bank account?

Your statement is true, but I think the holder would be worse off than the trader during a crash. I think there are two things that are most likely to happen to a holder during a crash:
1. The holder doesn't sell, but instead the holder ends up **buying more** because the *buy-the-dip* mentality takes over, thus exacerbating the holder's losses.
2. The holder takes a much longer time to sell than the trader while prices crash because the holder has an internal debate over whether to keep holding or to sell. In contrast, the trader probably has proper risk management in place to protect himself against such losses. (A physical stop loss order is one common risk management tool traders use and takes emotions out of play.)

You've got to admit probably 80% of people who own BTC are doing so as a speculative play and the other 20% own BTC because they believe in what Blockchain technology can do for society.

What would a huge rally signify?
I can think of two causes for a big rally:
1. More people speculating.
2. More people seeing it as a safe haven for their wealth.
If it's more speculation, then to me that means people are buying BTC with fiat now so they can sell the BTC at a higher price for **more fiat** later. So who exactly is getting the middle finger?
As for it being a safe haven, the way BTC is right now, I don't think the average Joe sees BTC as a safe haven (I think I'm fairly average). It's way too volatile. I mean I suppose you could put your life savings into bitcoin, but you wouldn't sleep too soundly at night!
Is there a third cause I'm not thinking of?
(I'm just trying to figure out this Bitcoin thing.)
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:04:21
Why not? 
If one's smart enough to successfully trade BTC in the short term and has proper risk management practices in place, what's wrong with making and cashing in short term gains in Bitcoin? (I'm not saying that's me; however, I'm sure **someone** out there is making money off short term trades of Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:54:02
Fair enough. I guess it's a race between the banks' blockchain technology and Bitcoin to capture the general market first. That's what we'll have to see. 
Ripple seems like a promising blockchain based entity to capture that general market. Although I know they're not owned by the banks, they are however centralized and working very closely with the established banks. 
So, Bitcoin is/will become a threat to the banks, but banks can be a serious threat to Bitcoin too (from the point of view of mass-adoption at least).

There are more tools a trader can use to mitigate the risks you pointed out such as stop loss limit orders or wider stop loss orders. Plus the scenario we were talking about assumed that BTC crashed for good as illustrated by the holder selling at $1000, i.e., the holder was convinced the crash was permanent and sold.

This is me just speculating but I suspect some banks in countries with more lax regulations would be willing to work with decentralized exchanges to get more customers. For example, US based exchange Kraken has their account in a Japanese bank I believe. Now if all governments in the world become anti-Bitcoin then that's a bigger problem.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:43:50
True, but you still need fiat to pay for important things like taxes and insurance premiums. I don't see Bitcoin being an acceptable form of currency used by the government or insurance companies in the near future.

I don't think Bitcoin is a scam because it is decentralized. I do think it is most likely a speculative asset right now because I'm still not confident in its fundamentals. (Although, I don't see anything wrong with speculating on something.)

Bitcoin succeeding and disrupting traditional finance was what excited me about Bitcoin a few years ago, too. 
But I suspect 80% of the people into Bitcoin are in it to make money. (I'm not saying making money's a bad thing.) Whether or not that's good for Bitcoin's potential to improve society, that I'm not so sure.
Right now Bitcoin is seen mostly as a speculative asset and I sense that view is more of a corrupting force to Bitcoin's potential than anything.
