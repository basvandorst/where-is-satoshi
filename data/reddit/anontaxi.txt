Why use bitcoins for or have an anonymous service for a taxi?
For the first you can hire a taxi in nearly any major city in the world for anyone. You can not do that with cash or even cc with any current service.
On the latter some people prefer not to have taxi companies store your phone number, cc, home address, and travel information for any government or hacker to access. Also if you live in a less than ideal area most drivers won't come out to you as payment is not guaranteed.

Not everyone wants to walk outside hoping to hail down a taxi using cash. But yes this method is anonymous.
Berlin is actually one of our popular cities but I think more for privacy than flying.

US or International list?

No. We have been offering our services for over a year in the darknet invite only and now are expanding.
Only you are anonymous as we use current taxi networks (background checks and licensed drivers) for the service. Before you order you get confirmation of the taxi service, the driver's name, number (by request), and their license plate. We send out all drivers prior to payment.
This is a digital equivalent of getting a taxi off the street and paying in cash which can be completely anonymous.

With this service you or anyone you choose can be picked and dropped off nearly anywhere with bitcoins.
It's not much harder than paying in cash. But let's say you want a taxi and there aren't any that just happen to be near you or drive by. Sure you can call or use an app but that kills your anonymity.

Confirmation is sent prior to payment with the service sent in your area. If you disagree with confirmation information simply cancel order.
There's always a risk with any service regarding anonymity. Customer feedback is vital.

Nearly all. Ask to confirm.
Various measures are in place.
Car is sent first then payment for your safety.
Another driver is sent or refund.

We've had over 50 testers without issue. People don't have to wait anywhere I have no idea what you're thinking but you're off.
You pay before the taxi reaches you after confirm the order. Takes seconds.
First out of no where you emotionally claim we are only doing a few cities then want detailed information on our taxi's claiming you want proof. Afterwards you seem angry for trying to think how we are doing it (and being wrong) then blame bitcoin? Obviously you're not interested in using the service and have some emotional hangups.
To anyone actually interested pm me or post a question. If not don't waste my time.
