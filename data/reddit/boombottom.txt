Sure, nothing in life is a sure thing.  When investing in anything you have you weigh factors and make a decision.

You can build a payment system around a sidechain.   This sidechain can be built to confirm instantly and be completely closed(or not).  The payment system would accept BTC on the front and confirm using sidechainbux on the back-end.  Not much different than off-chain in terms of liability except for the possibilities to build on it, audit and open it.  With the sidechain, you have something you can build and scale into other things, lots of possibilities.  Imagine a payment system built on and powered by bitcoin but playing by different rules.

BitPay has zero responsibility or need to protect the price.  Much like the merchants that accept bitoin using bitpay, bitcoins being spent are not being held more than liability will allow.  Sure, you have a few merchants speculating, but by and large, most are hedging their risk.  Basically, it doesn't matter what the price is as long as people are using it.

No one will be dealing with the numbers!  This isn't some physical thing that you have to count out at the register.  You won't even be inputting the numbers, you'll just scan something and confirm the transaction, that's it!  You don't even deal with numbers today when using credit\debit.
  
This whole argument is a distraction, I feel like I'm surrounded by sheep.

Supply and demand.  Until 2016, roughly 3500 BTC is created every day.  When the reward halves, so does the supply, something has to give and it's going to be the price.

My point is that you do not need to deal with the numbers aspect of it, the computer does, you just approve it.  None of the options presented make it easier to do the conversion in your head, people will still rely on computers for this.  None of the reasons listed for converting make any sense when applied to real world practice.   So there is no reason to argue for change, lets focus on the real problems with bitcoin adoption like overreaching government regulations etc.. 
  
TL;DR:  People around here are being corralled and don't realize it.

Coinbase has essentially bridged the gap between the tech and non-tech populace with this offering.  If you've ever tried, you would know that trying to explain to a newbie how to securely create a cold storage wallet is a daunting task.  With this solution, anyone can create their cold storage using a trusted party.  Coinbase is the only bitcoin company that I trust and I will be pointing my friends and family at their vault offering for their cold storage needs.  I'm really happy to see coinbase leading here.

Their value isn't based on the price of bitcoin but rather the market share for their respective business.  Remember, they don't sell bitcoin, they are a payment processor who converts bitcoin to local currency.  If their business model revolved around selling bitcoin, then you could start to speculate about the impact of price on their business.  Even Coinbase who sells bitcoin is structured in a way that they are immune to the price.

It's not a good decision if you're looking to repeat last year.  If your outlook is longer by a few years; yes!

I don't know about everyone else, but I've settled down as I have learned about bitcoin and what makes it work.  When I first got into this, I would get very upset when the price went down, but as I have learned about it and its long term potential, I am actually happy that it's staying affordable(for me). 
  
TL;DR: I've mellowed out, maybe others have too.

Bitcoin is real money, you're not going to find any "efficient" faucets these days, they're all handing out pennies now.  If you want $100 dollars in btc, you're going to need to earn it or get real lucky.

You need to learn about how mining works.
  
This can be accomplished off the blockchain, but introduces liability.  Sidechains will solve this and reduce the liability.

They have historically done both.  They manufacture and then "test" the clients hardware before shipping it.  They are both crowd-funding their business and then ripping off the very people that funded them.  If they do a good job of crowdfunding and fucking people over, they will have enough capital to go it alone and no longer sell the hardware, like KnC has done.

It will stop when the force of the tide is too much for the Whale and it stops trying to swim so that it can re-coupe some of its energy.  Then, when the tide subsides and the Whale is well rested, it will start swimming again.

For now and the foreseeable future, it will be local currency.  You're dreaming if you think that's going to change anytime in the next few years.

I thought about this when they mentioned that they spend their time being connected and not traveling the speaking circuit.  This made me wonder how much direct input Allaire has in daily operations like the Coinbase Crew.
  
What do you find better about Circle?  I've only used Coinbase.

No one will be left with any questions about how much they are spending.  This just doesn't happen when it comes to people spending their money unless they have unlimited amounts of it and those are not the people that this stupid scenario is allegedly trying to court.
  
For now and some time going forward, the only thing people care about is the conversion rate with their local currency.  The proposed denomination of bits, mBTC, uBTC etc. does not help in that regard.  Not one **bit**!
  
Right now, when you check out at the register and use electronic payment, you are not inputting anything!  You scan and approve, that's it.  There is no counting of currency where denominations would make that easier.  There is just conversion and that is accomplished a myriad of different ways.  This whole conversation is stupid and does not accomplish anything except to invent one more thing that newcomers have to wrap their head around.  I've seen this argument for weeks now and the best response I have seen is that the current system using basic math with no obfuscation is the easiest to learn.  We want a low barrier to entry, yes?

First of all, this is a troll post, is attempting to poke fun at bitcoiners.  Second, it would make sense to keep copies of the keys so that you can recover bitcoin that is lost or not claimed later on.

The NSA using an exploit to gather intel is pretty much sop and does not serve your argument that poodle is worse than heartbleed.  Any schmuck on the internet can exploit heartbleed, the same is not true for poodle.
