I love you. Thanks.

You know, if you invented something as insanely amazing as Bitcoin, would you want there to be ZERO evidence that you were the creator? Nothing to tie you as the inventor who spent years of his life working on it? I think putting his name on the paper was him making sure the world knew his name, while not actually giving away his identity. He remained anonymous for five years even with his name on the white paper.

There's a lot of assumptions being made about this man. "Someone like Satoshi" I keep reading. But we don't know this guy.

Check the source. He is, reddit removes the extra one.

I'll be honest my full attention wasn't on your initial comment when I was reading it, I totally agree that would be the logical thing for him to do.

They don't work in the UK, I emailed their support about a week ago and asked if they would offer UK cards anytime soon... they just said they have "plans in the future"

$100? Probably never. But there is potential. Although it's dropping a bit right now (in the last couple hours) quite steeply it seems. About $100 down if I'm not mistaken. It'll probably shoot back up though... probably.
It's a gamble~

Haha, thanks very much for the tip :)

Hehe yea probably not. Not every penny; just savings. Just all my savings...

Yep. My coworkers that I've spoken to - in IT but they don't want anything to do with Bitcoin - had a hard time understanding that 1 BTC can be broken down many times... and you don't NEED to buy a whole coin to invest. This change might help others understand a bit better.
My boss just laughed at me when I told him I invested $400 into 1 BTC. Okay. But that's 1000 mBTC! Woo!

Haha, FastCoin already exists. 
I'd rather the new technology be used to improve something existing rather than clog the market further with a new coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:57:38
Thank you! I am indeed... and watching as the coin slowly reclaims its foothold. I think I've learned a lesson now.
EDIT: Well it's still droppingish. Impossible to know what it will do really.

It's almost a new moon, only reason it's crashing, duh
