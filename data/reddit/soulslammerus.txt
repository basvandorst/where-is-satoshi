Why/how do you mean? That it would become the ultimate fiat because of this? I’m saying under the condition that it would never be able to be used transactionally... (say onchain / scaling / lightning all fail)

Is BTC about to pump again ? I thought wall street was gonna short it

I mean you don’t really need one, it’s quite simple if you think about it. It wasn’t an article, it was a statement from my buddy who is part of Wall Street. It’s the only coin that doesn’t have a “team of people” building it / working on the network. It’s not a DAO... it’s the only coin that is truly 100% governed by the miners, which makes it even more so decentralized and “for the people by the people” considering there are more BTC miners than any miners of any other coin out there, which would make the consensus pool even larger and more variable (harder to plan a 51% attack)... doesn’t this make BTC the most trusted place to store your money out of any other coin on the blockchain ?

I’ve heard HitBit and some of the other exchanges for AVT are sketch. Should I just use Ether Delta ?

‪I heard recently the idea that because of the governance “issues” behind bitcoin, it makes it truly decentralized even more so compared to any coin. And that being this is the case, Bitcoin could eventually just be used as a “store of value” for the cryptocurrencies. Fed reserve. Imagine the label:: “BTC... XVG... LTC... etc. , Backed by Bitcoin” - thoughts on this?

Good point, I knew that in the past and completely forgot about that... too much info going into this dome lately. hm... idk, honestly he might just be acting like he knows more than what he does... I’ve been telling ppl for months now that BTC could die, then he told me “no it’s forever”... but I’m very aware of the bitcoin technical issues (comp sci info systems BA) and I personally see it going in the shitter, so I’m kinda confused unless like you said, he knows something I / we don’t...

Don’t do what lol? What do you mean by “this”? I feel like these are all very valid points that people should know in regards of what’s happening behind the scenes... troll alert

And if I’m wrong about this, please link data/articles that proves me wrong so I can learn from it. Thanks. And regardless of whether or not that one fact being wrong, it doesn’t change the outcome that Bill Gates could still do this single handedly lol.., can you do basic math with the current cap of 150B vs Bill at 90B? Lol... not even mentioning the idea of super corporations (Walmart + amazon alone) teaming up to do this, which would be wellllll over 90B lmfao... keep trolling bruh... yeah... PoS real safe man ��

This 12 mins could save ur investment

Market cap is different than the amount of money that has been put into bitcoin buddy lol.., you’re mistaken there. That’s theoretical potential in regards to future blocks been mined . Nice try though. And I never said anything about NEEDING proof of stake, I just said that it is the current theoretical solution, which is absolutely true, and the exact reason Ethereum wrote it in its white papers. And in regards to difficulty, I didn’t go much further into that because that’s an entirely separate video on it’s own, which is will be shown here within the next week. I know exactly how difficulty works, and it is very relevant to processing power. Again, nice try bud. Clearly no research here :) in this instance, speak not for yourself, but to yourself plz   
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:47:28
But that’s what I do ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:11:17
That’s a good thing for you. I’m glad you’re educated on this already. Good for you bud.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:20:12
That is also incorrect, because it is obvious that you are using the phrase “in existence” relatively with the amount of bitcoins mined (that we can use) + the ones that haven’t been mined yet. The true relativity here though in this equation is only to what HAS been mined. Thanks for the input though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:18:12
With your comment though I realized I should start putting a brief description at the top of my description on YouTube, to let the viewers know what to expect, so that educated people like you won’t waste their time. I learned something from you. Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:59:19
Lol did you not watch further? Because if you did, you would see that what that is leading to is the fact that the bitcoin network is already using more power than Denmark, yes the entire country, with only 11 million users out of 8 billion people on our planet. Do the math bud. I’ll school you with knowledge on processing power when I make the video this week on processing power, like I mention in my my YouTube description. Thanks for trying to help though!

Explain these errors please
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:14:39
Yeah man, it will come with time due to the actual ability to use this in our daily lives. If this gets mass adopted with the position it’s in right now (people trying to use it to buy material goods everywhere) it would lose tremendous value instantly due to the fact of how slow it is. Thanks for the communication ! Let’s open this discussion a bit more!

yeah... i dont think this guy realizes u can buy fractions of coins... i think he thinks its like the stock market lolololol
