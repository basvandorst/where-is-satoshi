Also ... The government is occaisionally good at doing things that are 100 percent right, but enormously unpopular.

There are worse things in the world than being a thief. Thievery can be the moral and right choice in some circumstances.

Social security keeps people from starving to death. I'll steal money from that dude all day long if it means old people don't starve.

I like governments. Sue me. Almost all good countries have one. It's kind of a thing.
How can social security withholdings be theft? It's just an idiotic assertion. You aren't required pay social security taxes. You can opt out of the system. You can work and deal only with cash or gold, or barter for services. Plenty of people do. My MIL hasn't filed a tax return in more than 20 years. She does everything in cash. She pays $0 in social security taxes. 
The government is good at lots of things. Anyone who can't see that is just willfully ignorant. The government is historically good at going to space. The government is historically good at rural electrification. The government is historically good at making the internet. The government is historically good at making sure cars have seat belts. The goverment is historically good at enforcing civil rights. The government is historically good at making sure seniors don't starve. Etc. 
Be a part of the system or don't. Your call. There's an off-grid cabin in Montana waiting for you!!

I know Libertarians. I like some Libertarians. But they are almost all assholes, even the ones I like.

A brutal and selfish one where apparently bad things only happen to other people.
