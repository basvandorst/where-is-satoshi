We are not related to Bit365 nor do we know the people behind it.
One of our key advantages is that we have built an automated system that pays out bets within minutes of the event completion. The system will simply not accept your bet if there is insufficient funds to pay it immediately, so you are guaranteed to get paid right away when you win.

Hi Habogi_Drive,
Thank you for your interest in DirectBet Tipster Championship :)
If you want to participate but you don't want to risk much - that's not a problem. You can state that your bankroll is 10,000 DOGE for example and play with them. That's equivalent to 0.005 BTC and that's all you have to risk !
There is no advantage for playing with a bigger stack. That's because the winner is the one with the highest percentage of profit and not the actual amount.
We specifically created the competition rules in a way that provides a playing level field for everyone.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
All the Best,
