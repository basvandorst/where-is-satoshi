First reason - to support the adoption of bitcoin
also, because I'm trying to get away from using my CC
and also because I dont trust using my debit card or ACH payments and checks (too easy for criminals to steal from me)

I always wanbted to have a bar with vending machines for canned beer, allowing bar tenders to focus on selling top shelf liquors and not wasting their time with bud-miller-coors drinkers

So yeah, kinda disappointing headline "You Can Now Use Your Internet Drug Money To Buy Beer At PBC" but Philebrity thinks they are the Anthony Bourdain of local journalism.

But how else will they talk to me for three hours?

This would be great for smaller venues. In fact, most small bars around here have a crappy ATM with high fees, so if we can just get the STAR network to hop on the bitcoin  train...

A handheld device, like an iphone that shows a wallet address is presented to the customer to scan with their phone. This device connects back to the POS, when a full payment makes it to the block chain order status is green, if a full payment is not made status is yellow. I dont see how this would be hard to do.

People pay with Credit cards, in the serice industry, you have to accept whatever your customers have, if bitcoin gets big, customer will DEMAND that bars accept it. Sure, you can go cash only, lots of bars do, but they lose the business travelers.

Welp, next June I will be digging through for this article to check if if this guy is genius or dud. No one can predict the future.

How will Bitcoin go mainstream? I mean, McDonalds doesn't accept NFC payments (WaWa does though). What will it take for me to pay with Bitcoin at the movies, or at a gas station?
How do get from here to there? VC money?

I was hoping for some $300 bitcoins by today. Actually pretty sad the price rebounded so quick. Is $1000 the new "stable" (last June we were around $100 for almost three months; hindsight 20/20)?

Download the source from github instead of running it from the website.
You can check the source to see it's not pulling from a large pool.

Isn't like every story on ars technica and engadget really just an advertisement.
