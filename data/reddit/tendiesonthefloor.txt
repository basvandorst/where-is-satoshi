Bcash seems like a pyramid scheme 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:21:46
Good point. Ok!! I’m fully on board 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:55:05
Sounds good until it’s banned

I wish South Park would make an episode on this... kylecoins verses cartmancoins anc all Kyle has to do is mock cartman while Eric cries and complains ����
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:45
Well it was obviously a joke haha

WHEN THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO BUY ITS NOT DIPPING 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:46:48
Y 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:39
My strategy: buy high, buy low
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:42:10
Do I really need a /s ?? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:48
Is there a better solution besides coinbase? Any apps? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:39:00
Well I just bought another .06 and it’s up another 300 dollars haha... at this rate next year I probably won’t even have .5 bitcoin even if I keep buy every week 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:52:58
Well, I bought 1 litecoin and have .03 bitcoin so looks like I’ll just hope for the best. It would be great if I get 1 full bitcoin before it explodes to the moon even higher than what it’s at now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:33
I’m in it for the longs 
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:09:57
Probably 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:55:09
Same logic people don’t want to admit it
