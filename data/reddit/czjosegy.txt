I'd like to see other pools working, since i'm not on deepbit, but good app.

What happens if someone uses someone else's cell phone (ex. if it was stolen/lost)? free bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-07-23 20:36:16
that's a good point, I didn't think of that too.
I guess I'm pretty glad I've never lost my cell phone, but now I'll be extra sure to not lose it.

How is the BTC calculated? MTGox price or bitcoincharts weighted prices or other?
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:01:41
the accounts at the support site of MTGox is probably unrelated to the accounts for trading

or it's just a good card and people are buying them for other reasons (other GPU-based calculations, video games, etc)
bitcoin isn't even big enough yet to affect prices of cards like that yet. think of # of cards made vs # of bitcoin users who want a $600 card... How long would that even take to cover costs through bitcoin generation?

In that case:
brb, ordering myself a fucking nice card.
(j/k, but really that's actually pretty awesome.)

There's no way bitcoin has that much of an effect on card prices.

$.02 change? bug?

If it's still a random dark pool trade, that was a HUGE amount of bitcoins at 20.
