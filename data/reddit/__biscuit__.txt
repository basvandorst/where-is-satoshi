Thanks for advice. Frankly speaking, all these services are pretty much the same for me. I’d be very grateful if you could explain why you recommend Xapo and Bitstamp. Bitpay card order option isn’t available for Europe if I’m not mistaken.

Nice to hear this info from an experienced user!  I think Xapo is a really multi functional solution. Wirex has it’s own pluses as well. I read their user agreement and even they are pretty alike. What makes me wonder  whether they have  license or not. I couldn’t find this information. Is it really matters for users or there’s no such thing for bitcoin services? And one more thing, Xapo card is linked to the bitcoin wallet. From Xapo web site: “The Xapo Debit Card is not a pre-paid card, so you do not need to pre-load cards with cash to make purchases.”; “If you transact using the card, funds will be withdrawn from your Xapo Bitcoin Wallet in bitcoins, and the merchant will receive payment in their own currency”. And wirex card is not directly linked to the wallet and must be pre-loaded in advance. Which option is more convenient and profitable?

Thanks. I’ve read about Bitstamp and as I’ve already mentioned I’d like to start with a a user-friendly Web Wallet. Coinbase cards are only available in the USA. Xapo seems nice and proved by time. What do you mean by saying “highly regulated”. licence? I tried to find this information, but there is no such information on their web site.

Hi everyone! It’s a very good question. I’m from Europe and I’m trying to find such card. I’m looking for a card that doesn’t have monthly/annual fees or any other hidden fees such as sms notification of 1$ per month. If such card doesn’t exist, please, recommend me a card, which at least will worth its monthly/annual fees.

Ok, Bitstamp has a license granted by Luxembourg's Ministry of Finance (this information is provided on their official website). And Xapo just has office in USA. And its headquarter is based in Switzerland. But it doesn’t prove that Xapo has a license. I mean If they had a license they would probably put this information on their web site. Or maybe someone had seen information about Xapo license? I’m not sure that Xapo and Bitstamp might be compared, as they provide different services, so maybe their license requirements differ.

The questions are really interesting. So how do the bitcoin debit cards work? Does anybody know the answers to these 3 questions?

Thanks for a good advice. as it turned out Xapo and Wirex have the same card provider, so their card fees are nearly the same. The way of card linking differs only. But which one is more secure and profitable? 
If the card, which is directly linked to your wallet is stolen, all available on the wallet funds might be withdrawn/spend. And if the pre-loaded in advance card is stolen, only the card funds are in danger and the wallet funds are totally safe. Which card linking option is best?

For now it’s easier. But when I first heard about bitcoin I was amazed of its fundamental principles. It’s money of the Future. If you have a bitcoin wallet with card withdrawal option, please, tell about your experience. Thanks in advance.

Thanks. I've checked them, but trading platforms might be pretty difficult for such beginners as me. I’m planning to start with a user-friendly Web Wallet, which offers easy, fast and fair bitcoin conversion rate. If you could recommend one I’d be very grateful
