Do you really believe there would be a revolution? Or have they successfully numbed us into not giving a shit no matter what? Just give us our technology, our phones, and computers, and tvs, and we will stick our heads in the sand regardless. Keep pumping us with fluoride. Stuff us full of processed food and GMOs and we'll do what you want. Pump up the Zika virus and try to justify the release of millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys as a giant human experiment. Nobody gives a fuck because they have succeeded in numbing the masses into zombies.

Based on this post, I ordered a Ledger Nano S and the envelope arrived ripped open and empty. Maybe you shouldn't put "Ledger HQ" in the return address.
Edit: Sorry, wrong post. I ordered based on this

I'm from the US and I was taught to use the Oxford comma in elementary school.

I am simply pointing out that "such commas" are not necessarily discouraged outside of the UK.

Same issue here. How long did it take from the time you opened a support ticket? I'm trying to take some cash out to go on vacation Wednesday...of course. This is my first issue with Bittrex...couldn't come at a worse time.
