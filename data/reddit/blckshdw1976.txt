Not sure if changelly is an exchange. Gdax is like Finex, Kraken and Bitstamp.
Coinbase is like Coinmama.
And yes, chances are XRP will eventually show up in the app.

Coinbase is a retailer-oriented provider for people to buy crypto in exchange for fiat.
Global Digital Asset Exchange aka GDAX is their parent-exchange so people can trade on the crypto they've bought.

[I've tried]( 
But although my English is OKish, it doesn't come close to the technical level of the language one must have to fully understand everything.
Also, being brazilian and all, we're not exactly a Nation of technology enthusiasts, there simply isn't knowledge available in Portuguese.

Funny you should say that.
Sometimes I feel this sub is all about technology.
I ownbitcoin since Silk Road's rise and I still have no idea about Segwit, BU, Nodes, hardforks and all the tech gibberish. Still hodling nonetheless.

It used to be about PGPs and decentralization. Now it's just about guys eating parts of their genitalia.

I wonder what is the ratio of us users who've ever seen or touched an actual physical Bitcoin. I also wonder why is it that the media resorts to the image of a physical coin that so few of us, have seen, touched or owned every time there is an article on the matter.
