Your money is obviously misplaced.  Public schools in a lot of places in the world are downright dangerous.  For a path that leads to university and a successful life, you need the money to pay a private school, which a lot of kids don't have.  Having teachers teach poor kids for free levels the playing field, so education isn't just a luxury for the rich.

This is dumbass.  And I don't *need* to troll Americans, they're brain dead and backward and do most of their own trolling themselves.


In my country, they do.
You don't seem to know anything about anything outside of America.  Get your head out of your ass and look out at the world someday.

For $5000, I could hire a teacher to teach poor kids for free for a year in my city.  What a pompous, first world waste of oxygen you are.  I hope you fucking die.

To report what?  That he bought some worthless internet money from someone who was selling worthless internet money, and they never delivered the worthless internet money?  I'm sure they'll get right on it.
