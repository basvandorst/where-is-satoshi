Bitcoin has advantage of being the first.
Bitcoin is accepted by big companies and small companies and is known by many in normal. 
If you go out and say I will give you 1 Bitcoin for this. Noone is going to say no. If you say Ripple right now is still in infacy. Wait for 6 months or so ..
Bitcoin has backing of major tech people who can make systems around it faster than other unknown coin.
There are more people with Bitcoin right now than ripple. Ripple can surpass it though easily if added to Coinbase/Gemini.
People like things which have been around and not been broken. Time advantage..

Everyone is searching for next big thing. Everyone is jumping like crazy. From XRP -&gt; Verge -&gt; ReddCoin .. oh man people are on cocaine. Some people are gonna get hurt bad. I was on Discord for XRP and people were talking "So whats next big coin?" its so dumb, that these peeps are late and they want every coin to go to 16k now! .. XRP has some credibility but they are all dreaming that it will reach 100$ like in 6 months or so. I hope that a bubble bursts and shitty people are thrown out of this mess so people can start building good stuff on it rather than just trade.

I transferred 0.10 BTC in 10 mins .. dont know what you talking about -_-

Yep. There is no math involved in craziness. Hodl until mid Jan, till people calm their nerves down a bit.

Don't know bro/sis .. its highly volatile. Maybe invest in BTC. But in reality, don't know as there are tons and tons of people investing and people are on nerves and many people means market can sway either way even if there is big announcement in support or against it. That's why Buffet always steers away when even the smallest investor is investing. Just invest in what you understand, don't worry about missing out.

Haha maybe with 2-3% a whole year with full 20k �� .. you can do that in Nasdaq too. Crypto is specially right now for more than 20% gains. If lucky more than 100%. But loss also extends that way. A lake full of tunas and crocodiles. Happy fishing :P

It will hit Coinbase, but people are right now just in it for gains. Most people who bought it, have bought it because it is cheap and they are comparing with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is gold, ripple is dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:02:48
I think this is the cheap Bitcoin. Already 20% down .. maybe if it can touch 12-11, some madness can die down immediately. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:14:19
How much percent are you aiming ? If it is even 5% .. that can buy you 100 meals .. mostly I think in meals sorry for oversimplification ✌️
