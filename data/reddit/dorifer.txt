Just remember that they can easily get their money back. You can not get your BTC back.

Can we block these spam links using the ?

For a moment I was surprised, than I saw tip was cancelled.

I imagine he might start an *awesome* trend. Image a protest in a foreign country, and you want to support the protesters? With BTC, it is easy.

It is called stealing.

The address even says HiMom

One of the  authors: Ma**sato** Koa**shi**. I see a pattern there.

Well, I think in a perfect world we would tip for helpful comments. I do not read that subreddit, but that is probably not going to happen. Maybe we could instead rely on cat pictures as quality measurement. Someone mentioned catcoins somewhere today.

Remember, the 28C3 was in 2011.

Can't. Not verified.

Or better: Take the high ground, don't message her at all. Don't be aggressive, be it passive or active.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:55:18
Well, this is not an advertisement link, so I regard it with a comment: I think we might see Bitcoin payout for ads quite often in the future. It is much more comfortable for both parties.

Neither. You generate addresses until you get one that fits. I bet there are generators for that out there.

Prostitution is legal in many countries.

To be honest, I don't really believe a Bitcoin is worth 1225$ (mtGox's current price). I think a lot of people make quite a bit of money trading bitcoins right now (my guess without underlying data would be 25-30% money laundering), but it will drop sooner or later - quite a bit.
tl;dr: does not mean it is not a bubble.

Tbh, it looks a bit like a GIF in the 90s. Why do you need a GIF anyway?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:08:19
It is also vastly easier to automate than other ways of payment.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:07:48
And, to be honest, it starts becoming a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:56:30
Out of interest: Who tipped them to you and why?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:57:07
Bitcoin "fans" "community". What next "€ fans"? "USD fans?".
I already see it: "Like this post to help poor people in Africa with BTC."
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:10:48
Cat pictures go well with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:29:23
Your account has more than 100 comment karma. You qualify for some free BTC via Take a look at the sidebar: "REDEEM KARMA".
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:57:50
Actually, no. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:18:12
Insightful. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:37:25
Probably a scam link.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:46:56
Can we stop with religious comparisons? It is not that I mind religious comparisons at all, but I dislike the preaching style some people here make us of.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:07:59
I hope he did not. Talking elderly people to invest in a highly-volatile project and expect a return in time? That is nothing you do.

And I am here, waiting for my coinbase verification for 8 days. I finally decide to get some BTC, and now that.
