Nobody really knows.  It's complicated, there are many factors that drive price, but it all boils down to supply and demand.  Right now, I would guess that the okcoin fiasco is causing a lot of people to stop trading on that exchange.  Which means slightly less people are demanding bitcoin right now, causing the recent dip.
If I had to guess, the true price of a bitcoin is right above $200.  But don't worry, as more services are created to support bitcoin tech, and more people start using it, demand escalates.  The price won't be here for long.  Maybe the better part of 2015 though.

Have him watch some youtube videos about how it works.  
Also, don't EVER get defensive or into an argument.  Just give him information in a way that supports your position, building up a solid base that he can draw conclusions from.  YOU know about bitcoin because you've probably done some self education about it.  HE probably hasn't.  Describe some of the benefits of bitcoin, such as the concept of trustless payments, the impossibility of counterfitting something that's peer to peer, the ability to pay anyone from any country with just a phone, or print out your bitcoin so that nobody online can steal it.
As Einstein said (paraphrasing now) - if can't explain it in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.

The irony of that opinion piece that you linked, which proposes starting all sorts of wars as an economic stimulus, is that *is exactly what has happened*.  The "war on terror" which caused the US (and a lot of the rest of the world) to jump on board with *two* wars fought on a massive and expensive scale, and vastly increased the US deficit.  The economy boomed all the way until 2008, when an economic "hiccup" emerged, which we printed our way out of once again.

I think the bubbles will continue.  Honestly, we ain't seen nuthin' yet.  As stages of adoption occur, so will the bubbles.  We already had a Chinese nerd speculative bubble.  Soon to come: stock market investor bubble, bank integration bubble, up and coming generation adoption bubble, generic middle class adoption bubble, developing market adoption bubble.  I'll bet these bubbles get progressively smaller as time goes on though.
All of that excluding the next financial crisis, which would fuel and magnify any of those bubbles.

While having anonymity is one of the best things about Bitcoin, sometimes people don't want it.  Bitcoin needs to maintain anonymity while simultaneously providing identification, if that's what the user wants.
Example 1: The Charitable Donor:  Say you're walking down the street, and want to donate to the Red Cross guy waving a bell.  Say you want to do that in bitcoin.  Say you want to give this charity more than some loose change.  What are you going to want in return?  A fucking receipt so you can claim it as a deductible on your taxes.
Example 2: The Business Traveler: If you're on a business trip and need to keep track of your expenses, it would be easy and nice to not have to worry about saving your paper receipts.  Especially at POS transactions.
Would it be possible to build an optional email address into the wallet?  
So if you made an in-person transaction, you wouldn't have to worry about entering in an email address separately if you wanted a receipt emailed to you?
Obviously you would need to have compatible software on the other side of the transaction, but hey- pioneer this stuff.  It's got to start somewhere.
Oh, and +1 for coinjoin.

Apples and Oranges.  
Mt Gox price rise happened because of fraud and deceipt.  There was "fake" trading going on.  I suppose the same thing could be happening now and nobody realizes it, but I doubt it.  For one, Mt Gox was the big name in the game a year ago.  Nowadays trading is much more diversified, with multiple exchanges handling much more of the volume.  Also, security on these exchanges is much tighter, and people are more anal about holding onto their private keys.  
Also, this is a small rally thus far.  It could go back to $250 tomorrow, who knows.  Fuck the technical analysis.  Wake me up when we go over $1000 again.

They're trying to say that *inflation* is what makes war on a massive scale possible.  They are correct, and one only has to look at history to see it prove true.  Germany was bankrupt prior to WWII, but thanks to currency manipulation and hyper inflation they were able to drive their war machine to global proportions.
The history of war is in reality the history of money.  Bitcoin mathematically insures that induced, artificial inflation is limited, thereby reducing a nations ability to pay for wars on a massive scale.

Because it threatens the way that they perceive the world.  Simple as that.  They're not angry because they don't understand bitcoin.
I'm a vegetarian, and I find that when people discover this they get similarly angry- and I'm not the one that usually brings it up.  My being vegetarian implies that THEY are doing something wrong (i.e. eating meat) and in their minds, that I perceive myself to be superior by abstaining.  It implies that I know something that they don't.  Even if I never mention any of the reasons that I don't eat meat, they still perceive an attack.  And attacking something so basic (the *food supply*) is something that some people just can't handle.
The same lies true for bitcoin, I think.  Money is almost as basic as food is.  It's a defense mechanism.

People want what is easiest.  They don't want to think about it; they want somebody to take care of things for them.  I'm sure that when "plastic payment cards" started being handed out by banks people were even intimidated by that.  It was too new, blah blah, all the same arguments about bitcoin that we hear now.
Solution? For credit card implementation the marketing push was be the bad-ass sitting in a restaurant, and when it came time to pay, just handing that credit card over to a waiter.  Then, they took care of it for you.  How easy is that?  Everybody wanted one.  When it came time to pay for your food at the grocery store, people were already in line, ready to pay, in effect "forcing" the situation.  If they were still unsure about using a credit card, they could watch people in line in front of them use it and learn by observing.  (I'm talking our grandparents here, people)
Cell phones (not just *smart*phones, CELLphones) are too complicated for the general public.  The backbone of bitcoin is built upon internet access and familiarity with technology, two things that are poorly understood and not as readily available as we think.
The dollar will collapse before bitcoin reaches mass adoption, at least in the first world.

A horribly written article.  I hate the way she "interviewed" herself, which is a writing style that in my experience indicates the author has a horribly inflated view of herself.
Personally, I think Bitcoin's lack of female adoption has more to do with gender roles than this woman thinks.  Which gender picks careers on wall street, or programming computers, or engineering?  Bitcoin is the perfect storm of gender exclusivity.  That being said, when women use Bitcoin that means it has reached full adoption.

Well now we're getting somewhere.  *War bonds*.  Spending of money that you don't have.  Selling war bonds is just cost shifting.  Instead of paying for war with cash, a nation gets a bunch of volunteers to buy a shit-ton of bonds and voila!  You have enough money to pay for a war.  When the war is over, it's not like the nation that wins finds a treasure chest full of cash to repay those bonds, they just have more debt.
So how do you think those bonds are repayed?  By printing money.  Lot's of it.  I think the government got pretty used to this system, which is why the dollar has lost 98% of its value over the course of its history.  We're not even at war right now, but we're pouring money into defense budgets like we are.  Deficit spending galore.  It's easier to print our way out of it then repay it.
