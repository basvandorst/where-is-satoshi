This is great! With this being just the start of your tool I'm excited to use it. I'd also like a portfolio!

Hi ohias

At the time, the D3 was profitable but since I had to wait months for it to ship to me it is not longer profitable. You're correct the S9 is profitable now but if you buy it and it ships to you months later it will not be profitable. Feels like a scam.

I can. The point is I already purchased a power supply from bitmain. I was looking for a good power supply today that's similar and domestic.

True, for now I guess. Thank you for your replies man. I just want to make sure nobody looses their hard earned money to products like these.

Regretfully paid around $1450 worth of LTC at the time for the miner and the power supply. The point of this is by the time I received this, not only was the power supply missing, but the profits decayed significantly to the point where it's almost not worth switching it on.

Was thinking about just selling the whole miner all together. But this seems like a good backup. Thank you for your opinion!

OP pls, I'm with you. HODL!

My bitmain miner is in its box waiting for the power supply to ship. I ordered the miner alongside the power supply and assumed it would come with it. It was not the case.

I'm almost there, friend! Gives me hope

Should I hold for Trezor 2? I'm very interested
