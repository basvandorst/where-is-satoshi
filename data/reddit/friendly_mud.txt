It would stop them from spending money.

It's disgusting how jubilant you sound. These are people's lives being ruined. Have some respect.

Because he's fun. Lighten up.

2009 is not significant data. The landscape was barely established

Bitcoin only suffers from short episodes of price change. I don't know why you're so worried about it. It's going to be fairly stable now for the next few months so just get over it.

Someone trying to scare the market by saying that I could sell this on an exchange at any time?
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:33:32
I hope that never happens.

Easily maintained? This rate was unimaginable three years ago.

Don't be stupid, you can't pass everything through the the black or gray market.

How much do all these troll comments cost their owners? The fact that there's so many of them makes me realise that powers with a lot of money want to buy cheap coins soon.

The graph is from a Bolivar to BTC exchange, would you really be expecting to see that information *in this graph* if people are transacting directly in BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:44:19
What point are you trying to make?
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:05:07
Eh, adoption is at the highest point that it's every been. 1000btc were transacted in a week in a country where the average salary is less than 20 dollars per month. It is happening, literally, right now.

That's a completely different topic.

The guy who spends multiple millions per year on his security team? Google it.

Classist idiocy.

He has money for full time security and you don't. He can do what he wants.

I've been here since &lt;20k subs. Over the past 2-3 years there are times when you come onto this sub and think "am I going crazy, none of these comments make sense" and I began to realise that there's people out there with a lot of power who pay these guys to write garbage on bitcoin. It's usually a sign that someone rich wants to put in a last effort to buy the cheapest of the coins. Which in a way validates bitcoins existence

After a sustained campaign of negative articles and Reddit spam to depress price, they have bought the bottom so now it's time to buy some positive articles to get it back on track. Expect it again. It's just a shakedown of weak hands.

If scientists perfect molecularly correct assembly then all the precious metals will tank overnight and leave a vacuum far bigger for bitcoin to fill.

Ask someone of the same era how fractional reserve banking works and they'll give you the same reply so don't sweat it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:14:03
Lol. You've a lot to learn about personal privacy before bitcoin goes another 100x
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:59:16
Are you a multi millionaire?
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:19:52
So no then, you're not on my level. People have lost kneecaps for less than 20k so keep it in mind. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:03:10
You're wrong.
