The U.S. government is much more likely to pass laws to make bitcoin extremely difficult to use than to ban it outright.  For example, today you must report a seperate capital gain transaction every time you buy a cup of coffee or anything else using bitcoin.  For those who want to follow the rules, that puts a huge damper on any "spend and replenish" strategy!

1. You can buy GBTC in any brokerage account with no special setup.  Buying bitcoin on an exchange requires opening a separate account just for that one asset, providing ID, proof of residence, tax ID, etc. to possibly shady organizations.
2. You can buy GBTC in seconds, using funds already sitting in your brokerage account, without waiting for funds to transfer.  When you sell, the proceeds go directly back into your investment account, again with no delay.
3. You can invest IRA funds.
4. You can let the professionals worry about securely storing the bitcoins, rather than keeping your own offline computer or hardware wallet and possibly screwing it up.
5. Yes, you pay a premium for all this convenience, but you get that premium back when you sell, so it really makes all kinds of sense!

GBTC is an excellent way for the average investor to get exposure to bitcoin without having to worry about scammers, secure storage, losing their investment when an exchange gets hacked, etc.  You can easily trade them right in your existing brokerage account, without having to establish a relationship with a single-purpose bitcoin exchange.
For U.S investors, it's the easiest way to hold bitcoins in an IRA.  It's especially great to hold bitcoins in a Roth IRA, where you never pay capital gains tax.
Thus the premium.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:11:10
There are lots of reasons to believe that the price may soon go up significantly, and I think it's entirely appropriate for the early bitcoin supporters to be the ones who profit from it.  Owning 1 BTC, or even 21 BTC, is not going to change anyone's life anytime soon.  We should all be asking ourselves how many bitcoins we need in order to be "set for life" if bitcoin hits $10,000 in a few years.
Bitcoin has been the best performing currency in 5 of the past 6 years.  That alone is enough reason to hold 5-10% of your investments in Bitcoin.   Once COIN is approved, a lot of investors will start doing exactly that.  Why would anyone reading this subreddit not want to be aboard that rocket ship?

The Internet had essentially the same image problem 20 years ago.  It was full of hackers  and child pornographers.  However, the technology itself was so compelling that it soon grew far beyond all that.
So the question you have to ask yourself is, does Bitcoin have significant advantages over fiat?
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:32:59
COIN is going to make it easy for big institutions and average Joes to invest in bitcoin, even using retirement funds.  Of course, GBTC already does this, but COIN is more direct and will get 1000 times the publicity.
COIN will take bitcoin mainstream for investors, which will significantly boost the price.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:10:49
The probability of it going all the way to zero within the next 100 years is pretty much nil, and it's unlikely to hit a million in the next decade unless there's hyperinflation of the U.S. Dollar, something that could realistically happen, what with quantitative easing and all.  But you probably meant that Bitcoin would become worth a million of today's dollars, which I think will take decades at least.  So for the next few decades, I think it's almost certain to be somewhere in between.  It's time to put this "nothing in between" myth to bed.

Another option is to buy GBTC, and let professionals handle securing the coins.  This has the advantage of making it easy to invest retirement funds.  Unfortunately, the premium is a bit high recently, so it might be better to wait until the price of GBTC comes down somewhat.
I'm not saying that this is necessarily the best method, but it certainly is an option that should be considered.

Just tell them that you're focused on the long term and not so worried about short-term trends.  One bad winter doesn't mean that global warming has been reversed, and one bad year doesn't erase the long-term upward trend of Bitcoin.
We're still in the highly inflationary Bitcoin creation phase, with thousands of coins produced every day.  This supply of new coins shrinks with every halving.  Meanwhile, demand from rich investors keeps increasing.  If these trends continue, the price must go up.
Historically, Bitcoin goes through periods of rapid price rise, followed by long periods of consolidation.  The best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior.  So this past trend is likely to continue, and we can expect another large, rapid price rise at some point.
We're in a relatively good period now, but when the economic news inevitably turns sour again, that's likely to trigger the next growth spurt for Bitcoin prices.  
"Buy low, sell high" requires two things: the vision to see that prices are likely to rise from the current point, and the patience to hold out until it happens.

There will come a time when the masses need Bitcoin, but will the infrastructure be ready?  Will there be affordable wallets that are sufficiently secure against accidental loss and theft?  Will there be easy-to-integrate payment solutions for vendors?  Will these technologies be scalable, well tested, well known, and well documented?
Because if Bitcoin is not ready, we may miss our shot.  Perhaps the world will turn to a global IMF fiat partially backed by baskets of commodities futures instead.  Because, you know that THEY are getting ready!
Every time I read about another Bitcoin theft, I cringe, knowing that Bitcoin is not yet ready.  I'm holding my breath that our opportunity will not come too soon!
So what should we do?  Buy and hodl.  Learn and share.  Spend and replenish.  Contribute where you can.  Demand better wallets, and support the best ones out there.
And very important, support vendors who accept Bitcoin by buying from them.  If accepting Bitcoin results in increased business, then more businesses will do so, and the infrastructure will get stronger faster.
The future we want might happen even if we do nothing, but let's at least try to be ready for it!
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:09:00
The real game changing aspect of Bitcoin is its ability to reverse the slide toward socialism.  Once governments lose the ability to tax indirectly by devaluing the money, they will be limited to spending only what they can raise through direct taxes, and there's a limit to how much direct taxation people will put up with.  When income taxes get too high, people stop working.  When sales taxes get too high, commerce moves underground.  When property taxes get too high, property loses value.  Bitcoin basically forces a certain degree of individual liberty by placing an upper limit on the size and power of government.
@_date: 2014-11-19 01:25:32
Hodling increases demand and helps keep the price up, which helps Bitcoin.  It also offers exposure to profit from rising prices, which helps you.
Spending and replacing has the same advantages as hodling, plus helps to encourage mass adoption.
Selling, or spending without replacing, is not so good.
If you only have a small amount, why not increase it?  The rich want to stay rich, so many consider some exposure to Bitcoin to be a good idea.  Why wouldn't it be a good idea for the average Joe?

Essentially, the exchange lets them sell an I.O.U.  It's just digits in a computer, anyway.  As long as the total number of shares in all accounts equals the total number of shares that exist, why should the computer care if some accounts have a negative number of shares?
They normally only let people or organizations with deep pockets sell naked shorts, because if the price goes up too rapidly, they must have the resources to pay off the gamble.
If you have bitcoins on an exchange that lets people do naked shorts, do you trust the exchange's procedures at vetting those it allows to do so?  What would happen to you if the price goes up, the naked sellers cannot cover their bet, and the exchange doesn't have the bitcoins when you want to withdraw?  
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:45:10
No, but at least it would at least give time for the infrastructure to mature.  Every time I read about another theft, I know the bitcoin infrastructure is not yet ready for large-scale success.  We need high security wallets that keep your coins extremely safe from accidental loss or theft, without requiring a degree in cryptography.  We need scalability.  We need ease of use and documentation appropriate for the average person.  Probably the best possible (and perhaps least likely) scenario would be a slow and steady price increase, giving us more time to prepare for mass adoption.  Here's hoping.

By that logic, all tech stocks are a pyramid scheme, since those who bought them early make money when new investors buy.  Real estate, too.  In fact, anything that can be resold.  If Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, then almost every other investment in the world must be, too.
The rich get richer because they own the banks and can get away with theft schemes like quantitative easing.  Bitcoin stops all that.
The Bitcoin millionaires are poor people who were willing to invest and work for Bitcoin while everyone else scoffed.

It comes down to the definition of liberty.  In a free country, you have the right to take any and all actions, as long as you do not initiate or threaten force against another.  True liberties are the right to act without interference -- to speak, print, worship, assemble, keep and bear arms, enjoy the fruits of ones labor, pursue happiness, etc.
An example of a false right would be the "right" to free medical care, which is just another way of saying the right to use the power of government to force others to pay for your medical care.  The only time you are allowed to use force against others is when defending yourself against their initiation of force.
Likewise the "right" to privacy is a false right, because it really means the right to force other people to not keep records about you.
The proper function of government is to protect individual liberty, and nothing else.  Any law that prohibits people from storing certain data on their own computer is an example of government doing the exact opposite of its proper function -- violating liberties instead of protecting them.
Americans used to have a saying, "Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never harm me."  Unfortunately, we have replaced that wise old saying with laws against "hate speech".  All the blockchain can store is information, and information is never force.

Bitcoin will never go to zero, because even if it is never globally successful, there will still be true believers for a very long time, and after that collectors wanting to own a piece of history.

Friends.  They call you an idiot for buying Bitcoin, then they call you a lucky bastard after it goes up.  Anything to avoid admitting that you have better vision.
I'd explain that a bitcoin investor buys in when the price is at or near historical highs, against the advice of friends, family, and investment advisors, with absolutely no guarantee that the price will ever go up.  He holds through flash crashes where the price drops by 80% in an hour, through months of boring price stagnation, and through periods of seemingly unsustainable rapid growth.  He does it because he has the vision to see that bitcoin is Money 2.0.
Tell your friend about the promise of a world where governments and the wealthy elite cannot steal money from the poor through debt-based currency and inflation.
Then ask him if he's clever enough to see the vision, diligent enough to do the research, and brave enough to make his own investment.

You can't blame some of the very early adopters for wanting to recoup some of their investment by partially cashing out, and you can't blame BitPay for being a mechanism they can use.
BitPay's current paradigm is a necessary intermediate step toward mass adoption.  We need lots of vendors accepting Bitcoin.  To get there, they need an easy way to automatically convert their Bitcoin income into the currently more useful fiat, and BitPay provides that.
There is a way to reward these vendors for choosing Bitcoin, and encourage them to continue to do so, without negatively impacting the price -- through spend and replenish, which BitPay makes easy, too.
To help Bitcoin achieve mass adoption, we need more people to buy and hodl, spend and replenish, tell all their friends, and work toward improved ease of use and security.
I'm tired of all the posts blaming those who hodl for delaying adoption, and I'm tired of the posts blaming those who exercise the system for driving down the price.  Stop blaming the people who got us here!

They used to send me tons of marketing messages, and I always responded, "I'm not buying anything else from Apple until you allow bitcoin wallets on your devices."  By the time they finally changed their policy, I discovered that I no longer had any desire to do business with a company that had actively fought against bitcoin for that long.

I have no incentive to bet with you on this.  It's impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy when and how far bitcoin will move, so I won't bet on my guesses.  However, I have had some luck day trading bitcoin (not with my HODL stash, of course!).
Bitcoin has a history of overreacting, then correcting.  The rejection of the COIN EFT is just the kind of news that causes these kinds of crashes, and a 50% move is not out of character for bitcoin.  I've watched it go from $1300 to below $100.  I don't feel confident that $800 is an absolute floor, since we were around $400 one year ago, and around $200 two years ago.  I'm not expecting to reach $200 again, but I'm not ruling it out, either.
I've already placed a fairly large bet, one with relatively little downside risk.  I sold some other assets in order to cover some sizeable buy orders for GBTC in an IRA at various prices scattered around 50% of the current price.  If the EFT is rejected, and if we see a major dip (40% or more), some or all of my buy orders will execute.  In all probability, bitcoin will bounce back within a few weeks or months, and I might make a 50% profit on that money in a short period of time.  There's a small possibility that it might not recover for years, but I can afford to be patient with my retirement funds.  I believe the risk that it never recovers is negligible, because there are lots of people all around the world who understand the potential of this technology.
So my bets are already placed.

I want to make the world a better place, and bitcoin is perhaps the best tool in that struggle, as it can replace the debt-based, fractional reserve system, which benefits the banksters, with honest money that only benefits those who use it.
Altcoins are at best a distraction from that struggle.

One thing I've done over the years is to do watch the media coverage and add comments correcting the many factual errors.  I don't know whether my efforts have played a role, but reporting about Bitcoin has become much more accurate over time.  I generally tried to be helpful and offer constructive criticism, refraining from personal attacks, but for some particularly incompetent articles, I sometimes went to the extreme of suggesting that the author should actually learn something about Bitcoin before doing any more writing on the subject.  Of course, I had to learn a lot about Bitcoin first, but that was fun for me!  Satoshi's white paper is a great place to start.

I think the price is going up right now because some whales decided to take advantage of the excitement surrounding the upcoming COIN EFT approval or rejection announcement.
So they start a big rally, spread rumors that it's happening because insiders have found out that the ETF will be approved, causing speculators to buy, driving the price up further, making the rumors seem more plausible, causing more people to pile in due to FOMO.  Then they do a massive sell at a high price, causing a crash, the speculators sell in a panic, and the whales do a massive buy at the bottom.  
The whales hope to profit by selling high, then buying low.
The ones who lose at day trading are the folks who buy in a panic after a sharp rise, then sell in a panic after a sharp drop.  Don't be that guy.

Now you can buy a 5 TB drive, a million times larger, on Amazon Prime Now for $123, and have it delivered within 4 hours.  That disk would hold 700 bytes for every human being alive in the world today.
Within a decade or two, we'll be at the point where an ordinary home PC can hold gigabytes of data for every human being alive.

I think the idea of putting all of your money into BTC ahead of the SEC decision might not be a great idea, depending on your financial situation.  If you have considerable investments and are approaching retirement age, you should not bet everything on such a risky asset class.  You might be able to justify 10-20% of your life savings.  However, if you're young and have a job that covers your living expenses, and not much in the way of savings, it might be reasonable to invest all of those limited savings today.
Consensus seems to be that the chance of approval is perhaps around 25%.  I've been watching bitcoin for many years, and my experience suggests that the news of a rejection is likely to produce a major dip, perhaps 50% or more, but that the price will probably recover quickly and be setting new highs within a few months, or perhaps a few years.  So if you're willing to hold through that period, the downside risk is low.
I think the upside potential is high.  News of approval will likely produce an immediate spike, probably something between $2,000 and $10,000.  However, I think that will bring a lot of bitcoins out of cold storage, and the quick spike will be followed by a large drop, but probably not all the way back to the current price.  Bitcoin always overreacts, but usually corrects fairly quickly.
When faced with a small downside risk and a reasonable possibility of a huge upside, it is smart to make a large investment.  However, bitcoin is much too risky to invest money that you're counting on for your future survival.
One possible strategy to consider would be to buy some now to be in a position to profit from an approval, and to put in some low buy orders in case a rejection causes a major dip.  My low orders currently range from $200 to $600 for BTC, plus between $50 and $70 for GBTC.

I've seen bitcoin go from $1300 to under $100 in minutes, and similar feats.  There's less volatility today, but bear in mind that we were at $400 one year ago, and $200 just two years ago.  I think those who say that $800 is an absolute floor have very poor memories.

I think central banksters are evil because they have a government licence to steal by creating money out of thin air and loaning it to us with interest.  That is pure evil, and global Bitcoin adoption puts an end to that.
However, there are some things that bankers do that are useful and not evil, like evaluating creditworthiness when making decisions about loans, and keeping safety deposit boxes secure.  As a rule, I'd rather engage a professional for those kinds of activities.  Let's not throw out the baby with the bath water.  Let's take away their power to steal, but allow bankers to continue to do the other things they are good at.

Some people on this forum argue that spending bitcoins is pointless because merchants immediately cash out to dollars.  I say its a chicken and egg problem, and that "spend and replenish" is a critical part of the bootstrap process.
Those who want to see the Bitcoin movement succeed should, whenever possible, support merchants who accept bitcoins.  If we reward those merchants, they will continue to accept bitcoins, and more merchants will join them.  Eventually, it will make sense for businesses to retain a portion of their bitcoin sales and pay some expenses directly in bitcoin.

My philosophy is to buy low, sell high.  This is clearly "low," which means its time to decide whether to buy more.  We knew all along that this was a long-term play, and "high" and "sell" are clearly not on the table now.
Has anything fundamentally changed about Bitcoin that suggests that it's not suitable to serve as money?  Have any major, irreparable flaws been discovered in the protocol?  Has development stopped?  No!
The phase were in now is the one where major adoption cannot really start in earnest until we have better hardware wallets and widely available investment vehicles like COIN.  These things are being developed.

Let me explain how pump and dump works.  First, someone takes a large position on an asset.  Second they "pump" the asset by talking it up to anyone who will listen.  Third, other people buy because of the hype they've heard, causing the price to go up.  Finally, the pump and dumper sells the asset, making a profit.
So "pump" means saying nice things.  An effective pump might cause the price to rise, but the price rising is not itself the pump, nor does it necessarily mean that someone is pumping the asset, saying nice things about it to get others to buy it.  In this case, it was probably just someone buying a lot.
Let's get the terminology right, folks.

Spending does support the price indirectly -- by rewarding vendors who accept bitcoins, we encourage them to continue and others to start accepting them.
Bitcoin has many of the critical characteristics of money -- durable, portable, divisible, scarce, hard to counterfeit, fungible -- but one area where it does not yet totally shine is widespread acceptance.  Spending is critical to changing that!
Of course, spending without replenishing puts a direct downward pressure on the price, so "spend and replenish" is the best option!

I'm saying that we should encourage more merchants to accept bitcoins, which will hasten the day when it is easier for companies to move more of their business into Bitcoin.

It is possible to store ALL transaction on-chain.
30 years ago, hard drives were typically around 5 MB, which was about 1/1000 of a byte for every person alive at that time. Today you can buy an 5 TB disk for $123 on Amazon. That's a million times larger, over 1000 bytes for every person alive today. Ten years from now SSD drives for laptops will be measured petabytes (PB) and exabytes (EB).  Processors and networking speeds have also improved, and will continue to improve, at similar rates.
Consider the extremely high rate of 4000 transactions per second, at an average of 250 bytes per transaction. That's 1 MB per second, which sounds like an awful lot. But even this extreme transaction rate would only increase the blockchain by 31 TB per year. A 5 PB disk, which I fully expect to be able to buy for $200 on Amazon 10 years from today, could hold 161 years of transaction data at that extremely high rate!
Satoshi picked the right time to launch bitcoin, because scaling on-chain would have been impossible 30 years ago, but it's quite reasonable today.  Computer power doubles roughly every two years, while the population doubles every 50 years or so, so it's only going to get easier and easier.

Yes, bitcoin is really the way to go.  It's been the best-performing currency for 5 of the past 6 years, and there's no reason to believe that will change.  I suggest buying some now in case COIN EFT is approved, and put in some low (perhaps $800) buy orders in case it is rejected.  Everyone should have 5-10% of their net worth invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-22 11:25:15
The difference between rich people and poor people is how they handle the money they receive.  Poor people try to figure out where to spend it, and rich people try to figure out whether they can invest it instead of spending it.
I believe that bitcoin is probably the best investment opportunity of our age.  However, you have to be smart and take the longterm approach.
The price fluctuates a lot.  Looking at the price history of the past 6 months, I would say that $400 is not a good entry point.  We will almost certainly see $300 coins sometime in the next few months.  Perhaps $200 coins.  Don't buy $400 coins today, when you can almost certainly get them cheaper a few months down the road.
Open a  account at an exchange (Coinbase, Circle, Gemini, whatever), move the money there, pick a couple of attractive entry prices, set some limit buy orders, and wait for a dip.  For example, you could set buy orders for 1 BTC at $200 and .66 BTC at $300.
Then plan to hold forever.

Bitcoin ALWAYS overreacts to news, especially bad news.  I would not be surprised to see it dip briefly below $400, although I think it would quickly correct to around $800.  I therefore have buy orders placed in the range of $200 to $600.

You've been listening to too much censored information.  SegWit and the Lightning Network do not save us from the banks.  
You're thinking about the original idea of bitcoin, as describe by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper: a peer-to-peer payment network.  The core team has abandoned that idea, preferring instead to make bitcoin just a settlement layer, introducing third parties as payment processors.  Unfortunately, third parties bring fees, and governments can force them to spy on their users (KYC/AML/etc.), and even to freeze or confiscate their accounts.
SegWit and LN are contrary to the original idea of bitcoin, which is why BU is so rapidly gaining in popularity.
The miners are supporting BU in an effort to save the original concept of bitcoin.
Personally, I think of the Core team as Team Darth Vader, and the BU team as the rebel alliance.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:05:09
Do you accept 40 cents as normal?  For small transactions, fees for bitcoin transactions cost more than credit cards!  The intrinsic value of bitcoin is the ability to send value across the internet fast and cheap.  Without that advantage, there is no global adoption, and Bitcoin dies.
I'll agree that the days of free transactions are over, but 40 cents is too much.  I'd like to see the fee for a non-urgent bitcoin transaction down to below 5 cents.  I would accept that as the new normal.

You probably bought GBTC.  Because of government intervention, GBTC is severely limited in its ability to create and redeem shares, which means that it does not closely follow bitcoin price.  However, since it's almost the only game in town for retirement accounts, it usually trades at a significant premium to the actual bitcoin price.  It's a poor substitute for a real EFT.
That said, I think GBTC is an excellent buy right now.  On speculation that a real EFT will be coming out, the premium is much lower that usual.  If the EFT is rejected, the premium should go back up, which partially offsets the probably price decrease.

If it is approved, you make a nice profit from the coins you bought.
If it is rejected, which seems likely, at least you pick up some cheap coins.  Bitcoin has a tendency to overreact to news, then quickly correct.  You might end up buying lots of coins in the $400 range, and then the price recovers to the $800 range within a few months.  Just don't panic sell while it's still down.

Big picture, dude.
We were stable around $230-ish for months.  There was a runup to $500 and correction to $325.  Then an unexplained rise to $450 and correction to $350.  Now we're at $380, 65% higher than the long-term stable price of just 4 months ago.
I think there was more than one reason for the latest correction: Mike Hearn, Russian ban, Crypsy, Bitstamp hack, but mostly that we were overbought at $450.
Unfortunately, this dip was too small to serve as the correction we needed.  We're rapidly climbing back into overbought territory, which means we have a bigger correction coming.  Bitcoin tends to rise too fast, then correct hard.
The longterm trend is up, but it's fun to buy the dips and sell the peaks along the way.  Sadly, this little dip didn't quite reach my buy orders.  At $500 my day trading account will be 100% fiat, and at $200 it will be 100% bitcoin again.

If I was the kind of person who wanted to take advantage of others, and was rich, here's what I would do:
* Buy a large block of coins, causing a hyperbolic run-up on speculation that it was caused by insider trading, then
* Sell an even larger block of coins, causing a major crash on speculation that it was insider trading, then
* Buy another large block of coins at much lower prices.
I think a whale could double their coins in the next 10 days using this strategy.
While it's impossible to accurately call tops and bottoms, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that we'll probably see both $1500 and $500 in the next 10 days.

Contrary to what you might have read on the miners are not stupid.  It's better for bitcoin, and better for the miners, for transactions to stay on-chain, rather than being forced onto third-party payment processors like the Lightning Network.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a peer-to-peer payment system, one that avoids the fees, weak points, and government surveillance (KYC/AML) that come with middlemen trying to make a profit on every transaction.
So just as individuals are gradually switching their nodes to show support to BU, the miners are also switching their support away from the SegWit kludge and back to Satoshi's original scheme.

I bought my first bitcoins in 2012, and have been a long-term hodler ever since.  I was wondering how so many people could be supporting that other software version, so I went over to that other subreddit.  Surely there cannot be 30,000 people all suffering from mass hysteria.  I was surprised by what I found.
* First, based on comments I read on I expected to encounter a bunch of raving lunatics spewing venom about this subreddit.  Instead, I discovered a nice community of reasonable people with some clever ideas.  From the posts that I did read, I saw a lot less name calling and insulting than I see over here.
* I discovered that they have a vision of Bitcoin that is more in alignment with the Satoshi white paper than the one being pushed by our devs.
* I have always believed that the tremendous growth rate of computer power, storage, and networking speed makes it reasonable to store all bitcoin transactions on chain, and I found a community of people who agree with that.
* There are lots of people in the world who have the resources to run nodes, and there are lots of people who do not.  Whether the entire blockchain takes 100 GB or 10 TB isn't going to significantly change those numbers.  I recently bought an 8 TB external drive for $200 on Amazon, and 10 years from now you will probably be able to buy a 10,000 TB external SSD drive for the same amount.  Allowing bigger blocks will not significantly reduce the number of nodes.
* Off chain solutions would introduce middlemen to the mix, and one thing I love the most about Bitcoin is that individuals can send value across the internet to other individuals without middlemen.  That feature is very important to me!
* SegWit is a very complex and dangerous solution to a problem that could simply be solved by throwing more hardware at the simple and proven software.  I believe that SegWit is seriously out of alignment with Satoshi's vision, and not the right way to go.
In light of my findings, I have converted my node to that other version of software, and I no longer support the idea of SegWit.  If you love Bitcoin as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to do your own research!
Let the banning begin!

I read somewhere that the SEC *always* waits until the last day to approve or reject, and that they *never* allow anything to be approved by default.
I also read somewhere that they always tell the submitter if it's going to be rejected, to allow them to withdraw their proposal, rather than have it be actually rejected by the SEC.  I don't know how much advance warning they give in these cases.
So one of these is likely to happen:
* The Winklevi might withdraw their proposal any day now.
* The SEC might approve or reject it on March 10 (since March 11 is a Saturday).
Manipulative crashes generally happen when there is bad news, giving the appearance that the bad news caused the crash, so it might happen when a withdrawal or rejection occurs.  However, a withdrawal or rejection is not really "news", since people are expecting it.  So it might happen on some *rumor* of withdrawal or rejection, or when some unrelated bad news happens, before March 11.

21 is a fairly arbitrary number.  One in a million, so what?
The questions I asked myself were, what lifestyle do I want, how much money does it take to be "set" for life, how soon do I want that to happen, what do I expect the price to do in coming years, and how many bitcoins get me there by then?
21 wasn't enough for me.  If the price goes to $100,000 within 20 years, that's only $2.1 million.  That's enough for a comfortable retirement, but not enough to support all the first class travel I want to do.

I don't consider 6 months to be long-term.  I've been hodling for five years, and plan to hodl until the day that cashing out would be just plain silly.  My long-term prediction is moon within a decade or three.  If you want a number, I predict that the U.S. dollar will be worth less than 0.1 satoshis by 2050, partly because Bitcoin goes way up, and partly because the dollar goes way down, in real terms.
My medium-term prediction, for six months from now, is either significantly higher or lower than today, depending on external events that I cannot predict -- EFT approvals and rejections, financial crashes, political instability, socialist government meltdowns, a government adopting Bitcoin as it's national currency, central banks adding Bitcoin to their reserves, etc.  Most of these things would cause Bitcoin to go up.  Regardless, I will continue to hodl.

I expect serious volatility in the coming weeks!
There's been steady upward pressure for a *long* time now, and that often ends with a hyperbolic upward move, followed by a big crash.  The conditions are ripe for the hyperbolic upward move to happen in the next 11 days, as any sharp upward move will be perceived as a sign of insider trading in advance of EFT approval.  Rumors and FOMO should make this one a big one.
If the price does go hyperbolic before there's news, I suspect the whales will initiate a major crash, which will be interpreted as insider trading in advance of EFT rejection, and rumors and FOMO will make it a big crash.

The fact is that the Core team has strayed far from the original idea of bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system.  They're trying to convert it into a reconciliation system between the new "banks", the third parties like the Lightning Network, which will come with fees, weak points, and government surveillance (KYC/AML).  This is not the bitcoin we've been fighting for over the past 8 years!
People are flipening over to BU because it more closely resembles the bitcoin described in the Satoshi white paper.
Personally, I think of Core as the Darth Vader implementation, and BU as the rebel alliance.

I think the zero-or-moon nature of bitcoin is exaggerated.  I agree that a price of $1 million is possible.  It's a better form of money.  The existing mainstream money is as obsolete as the horse-drawn carriage 100 years ago.  It will be replaced.  The only question is by what.
However, a price of zero is not a realistic option.  You're never going to convince everyone in the world that it's worthless.  You'd have better luck convincing the one million Esperanto speakers in the world to give up their favorite hobby.

Bitcoin went down because it went up too quickly.  It's a typical correction.  From here it will definitely either go up or down, although it could hover at this level for a while first.
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:16:32
As a trader, I sell after it goes up.  This only works if I can find someone foolish enough to buy after it has gone up.  That would be your role.
Likewise, I'll need you to hold until it crashes again, so you can sell when I'm buying back in.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:35:08
I love your timing.  The price stayed around $200 to $300 for a couple of years, and you didn't buy.  Now it's almost $600, and you suddenly  want to buy.   I'm guessing you'll probably want to sell when it drops back down to $300 again.

1 BTC is not enough.  Even if bitcoin goes to $1,000,000 you would not have enough to retire early.
I'd recommend 5-10% of your net worth.  Most people will be able to let that amount "ride" essentially forever.  If bitcoin stagnates, it was only a smallish investment, but if it goes up, it was enough to change your life.

Hard to say.  I sold some in the 900s and more in the 1100s.  I've bought back a few in the low 800s, but I'm hoping to get more in the 500-800 range.  However, if we stabilize here, I might eventually buy back in the upper 800s.  We will probably see both $1500 and $500 again, the difficult question being which first.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:52:38

Without you, me, and all the others with the vision and tenacity to hodl, no matter what happens to the price, Bitcoin would fail.

It's impossible (in the real world) to call bottoms and tops, so I spread out orders over a range.  The fiat I raised by selling in the range of $910-$1160 went into buy orders in the range of $400-$900.  Some have executed already, but others will just sit there for now.

I can give you some insight.  I am both a hodler and a trader.  I have some bitcoins which I will hold until fiat disappears, but I also have others which I use for trading the short-term fluctuations.  I sold some of my trading bitcoins in the 900s and 1100s, and I've been buying even more back in the 800s.  Selling after it goes up and buying after a crash accomplishes two important goals.  First, I increase my Bitcoin holdings, and second I make the price a bit more stable.  If I had more resources, I would increase both my hodling and trading stashes.

Personally, I think you're asking the wrong question.  Instead of asking whether to make an inconsequential investment in what may be the biggest investment opportunity of our age, you should be asking yourself how large an investment is enough to change your life.  For example, if you think a price of $75,000 is reachable within 10 years, then investing $40,000 today will yield $4 million if that price target is reached.  That's enough to change your life.  There's really no point messing around with a $750 investment in anything.

Here's the thing.  The world population doubles roughly every 50 years, a rate that is gradually slowing, while computer power doubles roughly every 2 years, with no end in sight.
A few decades ago, enough computer storage to hold 1 byte per human in the world would have been very expensive.  Today, enough computer storage to hold 1000 bytes per person is cheap.  In a few decades, we can expect it to be cheap to hold gigabytes of information about every human on earth. 
Today, it's really no big deal to hold the entire Bitcoin blockchain on an average laptop.  The blockchain could grow at rates much faster than today and still be a trivial size for tomorrow's computers.

I have to wonder how many of these people will be asking themselves a few years down the road why they didn't take a serious position when they had to they opportunity.  I recommend putting 5-10% of your net worth into bitcoin.  If it goes to zero, you don't lose all that much, but if it goes up a couple orders of magnitude, you're set for life.  Even if we make it all the way to $1,000,000 within the next 10 years, owning just one bitcoin isn't going to make you rich, as a million dollars isn't what it used to be!

What I've learned in five years of bitcoin trading is to buy more than you think is reasonable when things look really bad, and sell some of your holdings when it feels like we on a nonstop ride to the moon.  It takes discipline to believe in bitcoin when things seem bleak, and to never make panic trades.

I've been trading GBTC for a couple of years in my 401k.  The only downside is that it carries a fairly substantial premium.  Each share represents about 0.09 bitcoins, so it should cost $85.50 right now, but the actual price is $121.65.  Not a big deal if you get the same premium when you sell it.  However, the premium may disappear overnight if COIN is ever approved.  Also, I believe that GBTC magnifies the volatility of the underlying product.  So I would not recommend buying when you think we're near the top.

The market cap of Bitcoin is so low that the U.S. or many other governments could get a large portion of the existing ones without spending a fortune.

I think all of these proposals make it too complicated.  There is a simple, safe solution.  At each difficulty adjustment, set the new blocksize limit to the median of all the miner's votes during the last period, limited to a factor of 2 change in either direction.  Period.  This is immune to 21% attacks, can scale very quickly, never requires another hard fork (because it includes no hard limits), and puts the power where it should be, in the hands of the people who secure the network with their hashing power.
If a group of mining pools decide to take the limit somewhere crazy, the factor of 2 limit ensures that the community will have time to react, perhaps by pointing their hashing power to other pools.

In the U.S., the tax laws require you to report a capital gain (or loss) every time you spend bitcoin.  All that paperwork would be a huge hassle, and if you don't do it, you risk jail time.  That puts a pretty big damper on any desire to spend bitcoins for everyday purchases.

The simplest solution is to let the miners vote on the new max blocksize when they mine each block.  At each difficulty increase, the median miner's vote from the 2016 blocks since the last difficulty increase becomes the new max blocksize.
The problem with imposing artificial limits, such as the two curves mentioned above, is that we don't know today how quickly Bitcoin will grow.  We need to be ready to accommodate mass adoption as it happens.  This proposal provides adequate protection for Bitcoin, while still allowing miners to scale the maximum block size as quickly as needed to respond to any evolving scenario.

A.  It's doable because computing capabilities are increasing MUCH faster than the world's population.  In the 70s and 80s, disks were measured in megabytes.  In the 90s and 00s, in gigabytes.  Now they are measured in terabytes.  CPU power and network speed have likewise made similar leaps, and this progress continues with no sign of slowing down.
While computers are a million times more powerful, the world's population has only doubled.  Today's ordinary laptops are big enough to store about one transaction per person per year, but soon they will be able to store thousands per person per year without even blinking.

I support a maximum blocksize that grows over time, but a calendar-based solution is not flexible enough.
We must ready for widespread adoption when our moment arrives.  We need a solution that allows the community to adjust the maximum blocksize fairly rapidly (once every two weeks would work) based on our combined perception of what's happening in the world.
I propose that the miner's should "vote" by placing a preferred maximum blocksize value in each mined block.  At each difficulty increase, the median value from the previous 2016 blocks becomes the new maximum, subject to a factor of 2 change in either direction and a 1MB overriding minimum.
The decision power does not all go to the miners, since exchanges can "vote" by giving preferred rates for newly-minted coins with reasonable values, and perhaps even refusing to accept new coins outside of a certain range, and individuals and organizations can "vote" by giving their business to those exchanges.  Ultimately, those who actually use bitcoin could make bad-acting miners feel considerable pain.
This is a simple, elegant, flexible solution, not subject to 21% attacks, eliminating the need for future hard forks to address maximum blocksize  issues.

I agree that scaling the maximum blocksize based on the calendar date is not a great idea.  We need a solution that allows scaling up fairly rapidly when widespread adoption occurs, but not just to accommodate no-fee spam transactions that expand the blockchain pointlessly.
I believe the best solution relies on the miners, the individuals and organizations that secure the Bitcoin network, to act in their best interest and use their best judgment based on what's occurring in the outside world.
I suggest allowing the miner's to "vote" on the maximum blocksize by indicating in each mined block their preferred value.  At each difficulty increase (every 2016 blocks), the new maximum blocksize becomes the median value of all those votes.  Unlike some of the other proposals floating around, using the median value is not only an elegant solution, and not calendar-based, but is also immune to any kind of 21% attack.
I'm not sure it's necessary, but this could be coupled with limits of how slowly or quickly the maximum block size could change, for example limiting any change to a factor of two in either direction from the previews value.  This could be coupled with an overriding minimum of 1MB, but again I doubt that would be necessary.
Note that this allows the community to continuously adjust the maximum blocksize, eliminating the need for future hard forks.  By community, I'm not referring to those who post the most in the forums, but to those who invest time and money into mining equipment.  You make your wishes known by pointing to a pool with a reasonable policy.  The power doesn't all lie with the miners, either, since exchanges could "vote" by giving preferred rates to newly mined coins from pools with a policy they like, traders and payment processors could use exchanges that promote reasonable policies, and so on.  There are many ways that the community could punish bad actors.
@_date: 2015-09-04 12:50:53
Your proposal is simple, but it's not flexible enough.  We should not assume that we can know in advance how soon or quickly Bitcoin adoption will happen, so we need a mechanism in place to grow the max blocksize quickly when needed.
Most social networks grow on an S curve, slowly at first, then rapidly shooting up, then leveling off at a much higher usage level.  If we cannot scale quickly enough to handle massive adoption, we miss our moment.
Facebook went from a few million users to a billion users in a relatively short period of time.  If they had massively failed to support that sudden growth, they would have never achieved their current dominance.
I therefore propose a solution that is simple, flexible, and can scale quickly.  Each miner "votes" in each block on the next max blocksize value.  At each difficulty adjustment (roughly every two weeks) the median of all votes during the prior period becomes the new max blocksize.
Your proposal also does not distinguish between spam and adoption.
Under my scheme, if some country announces that they're adoption bitcoin as their national currency, the miners can make sure we're ready for the sudden growth.  But if the transaction load is just fee-free spam, the miners would not have an incentive to grow the blocksize to support it.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:22:30
I support bigger blocksizes, and I like the idea of miners voting, but this proposal seem too inflexible, as well as subjecting bitcoin to 21% attack, plus guaranteeing another contentious future hard fork.
What about simply, at each difficulty increase, setting the new maximum blocksize to the median value of all miner "votes" from the prior 2016 blocks, subject to a limit of a factor of 2 in either direction and an overriding minimum of 1MB.
We need to be able to scale rapidly when widespread adoption happens.  Remember the S curve!  In an emergency, my proposal would allow scaling ten times faster than yours.
The only advantage I see to your proposal over mine is that it better protects against a theoretical "big block mining cartel" attack.  It's not clear that miners would actually collude to do any harm to bitcoin, but my proposal still allows the community to stop such an attack.  Exchanges could choose to give better rates to newly-mined blocks with reasonable maximum blocksize votes, and perhaps even refuse to accept new coins with extreme votes.  Traders and businesses could reward those exchanges with their business.  Through these and other mechanisms, the community could cause bad-acting miners considerable harm.
Edit: for clarity.

@_date: 2015-09-04 13:10:42
I think this is a great suggestion!  I'd like to see 1 minute average between blocks.  (Of course, we would have to scale everything accordingly , like dropping the reward by a factor of 10, etc.)
The bottom line is that data rates are already high enough to propagate even 32 megabyte blocks between data centers in seconds, and they continue to get faster.
We need to start thinking of bitcoin less as a hobby of nerds living in their parent's basement, and more as a global finance system.  We need to be ready to support thousands of transactions per second.  Shorter confirmation times can help.
We need to get over the idea that a $100 microcomputer with minimum configuration must be able to hold the entire ledger!
Yes, 1-minute blocks will somewhat increase the orphan rate, so you'll want to wait 5 minutes for 5 confirmations (on average), just to be safe.  It's better than what we have today!

SegWit+*EC* would be a fair and reasonable compromise, giving each side what they want.  On-chain and off-chain scaling can compete, although unfortunately not on a level playing field, since SegWit bakes in an automatic discount for the bandwidth it uses.

As for being a shill, Google my username, and you will find out that I've been defending and explaining Bitcoin to people for about five years.  I've written hundreds of responses pointing out errors, or giving additional detail, on articles in the mainstream media.  I've written thousands of posts on bitcointalk.org and reddit forums about Bitcoin.  I've only used that one username when writing about Bitcoin in all these years.
The only time I've ever been paid for writing about Bitcoin was the time a user tipped me about $5 worth of Bitcoin for my detailed instructions on how to set up an IRA LLC for holding bitcoins directly in a retirement account, long before GBTC existed.  We had a warm community back then of people who truly loved Bitcoin.
If you haven't had a chance to read the Bitcoin white paper yourself, I highly recommend it.  I think it's impossible to come away from that loving Bitcoin and simultaneously hating the miners.  The miners are the foundation that allow Bitcoin to function properly.  I'm opposed to SegWit because it is an attack on the miners, and therefore an attack on Bitcoin.
Satoshi did not feel that any maximum blocksize was needed, and reluctantly added the temporary limit to protect against a theoretical spam attack.  He said at the time that the cap would need to be raised long before the blocks got full.  From my understanding of the white paper, I'm pretty sure that Satosho would have approved of EC, but not of SegWit.  Granted, that's just my own opinion.
I still believe that Bitcoin, the peer-to-peer digital cash system invented by Satosho Nakamoto, can change the world.  We just need to get rid of the parasite organization Blockstream, whose sole goal is to destroy Bitcoin by blocking the steam of transactions.

Emergent Consensus.  Let the blocks grow.  Computer processors, storage, and bandwidth continue to expand at tremendous rates, on the order of doubling every two years, while it takes 40-50 years for the population to grow.  That means as the years go by, it becomes more and more trivial for computers to be full nodes.  A hobby computer 20 years from now will have 1000 times the power of today's home computers, more than enough to store the entire blockchain even if we had 100GB blocks today.

Perhaps.  It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.  However, the best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior.
I've been a hodler for years, but a couple of months ago I diversified a small percentage of my BTC into ETH, and that relatively small initial investment has grown to be my single largest investment.  It cannot be denied that ETH is acting like a rocket ship to the the moon.
It is my fervent hope that the miners grow some balls, stop signalling SegWit, start signalling EC, and let Bitcoin scale as originally intended.  Transactions would become fast and cheap again, and we'd stop losing market share to the altcoins.
I'd be willing to lose my entire investment in ETH in exchange for seeing Bitcoin get back on track!
Yes, I am hard on Blockstream Corp, but they totally deserve it.  They are a group of banker-funded programmers with a mandate to destroy the greatest invention of our age, and SegWit is their current weapon in that battle.  Never forget, Bitcoin is first and foremost a *peer-to-per* electronic cash system, not a settlement layer!

Miners have always had the power to "vote" on the consensus rules with their hash power.  This method of determining consensus is clearly spelled out in the white paper:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.  Proof-of-work is essentially one-[hash]-one-vote.  The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
"[Mining nodes] vote with their [hash] power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

During the global adoption phase, we can expect transaction counts to increase very rapidly.  If all goes well, it's soon going to take at least a powerful desktop computer with an external hard drive to run a full node.  The days of raspberry pi are over.  That's how we know that Bitcoin is succeeding.
However, don't forget the fundamental truth, that computers and networks are still getting more powerful at a tremendous rate, while the human population only doubles every few decades.  Long-term, the trends favor Bitcoin being able to handle all financial transaction on-chain.  Only the bankers want you to believe otherwise.

My point was that SegWit+2MB is not a compromise, but a total capitulation.
While I can see that SegWit+EC would be a fair compromise, that does not mean that I support it.  Only 29% of the miners are signaling SegWit, and one of those publicly stated that it's only to avoid DDoS.  Meanwhile, 49% of miners are signaling for big blocks (EC or EB).
The big blockers are already well ahead, and getting further ahead as time goes by, so why do we need to compromise with those whose stated goal is to destroy the "peer-to-peer electronic cash" aspect of Satoshi's peer-to-peer electronic cash system?

SegWit+2MB gives the bankers everything they want, converting Bitcoin into a settlement layer for the new banks.  It does nothing to preserve Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as described in the title of the white paper, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".

I recently unplugged one of the older ASICs, which mined about 1000 times faster than a GPU, because it was only bringing in about a penny per day.  That was fine in the winter when we needed the heat, but as Phoenix starts to warm up, I don't want to have to pay any more for air conditioning than necessary.
I'm not complaining.  The machine paid for itself over the year that I ran it, but it stopped bringing in more than the cost of electricity many months ago.  I may fire it up again on some cold winter day just for fun, but it's never going to bring me any more profit.
So the idea of selling that PC and buying one of the newer ASICs isn't a bad one.  Maybe you could pick up some relatively new hardware from one of the mining companies that recently went bankrupt.  If you get some cheap hardware, with free electricity at night, it might pay for itself in a few months.
As long as you're not expecting it to make you rich, mining is kinda fun!

It's difficult to make money by mining any more without a large investment and cheap electricity.
One of the simplest ways to own bitcoin is to buy shares of GBTC in a brokerage account, letting the professionals handle the storage and security of the actual bitcoins.  You could even do some daytrading there, but commissions would probably exceed your profits with such a small investment.
You didn't say where you live.  If you're in the U.S., consider holding or daytrading larger amounts of GBTC in a Roth IRA, where the gains are never taxed.

Karpeles had the Williebot buying bitcoins at a high rate (without any fiat in its account).  Perhaps he was hoping to start a run up to some much higher level, where he could sell those bitcoins and get MtGox back in the black.  It didn't work.

Well, Blockstream is a banker-funded organization with stated goals of converting Bitcoin from Satoshi's peer-to-peer electronic cash system into just a settlement layer.  Essentially, they are trying to destroy the greatest invention of our age.  It's hard for anyone who loves the idea of Bitcoin not to see that as evil.
I don't think most people on actually like ETH, but it is foolish to ignore the fact that businesses are switching to ETH because it has fast and cheap transactions, and abandoning Bitcoin because it does not.

I remember watching in November 2013, thinking that there was no good reason for the price to be going up so far, so fast.  It's not like there was any real news.

There's no reason to expect those past patterns to repeat, since there is no Williebot running today.

Most people who read anything about SegWit outside of the heavily-censored forums come fairly quickly to the conclusion that SegWit is bad for Bitcoin.
The support for SegWit comes primarily from employees of banker-funded Blockstream, and from people who only hear the arguments that the censors allow through.
Think about this.  30% of the miners are signalling for SegWit, and the largest of those miners has publicly stated that the only reason he's signaling for it is so that he won't get DDOSed.  Seriously, outside of the censored forums, there is almost zero support for it.  That should tell you something!

As we're approaching the limits of the HDD storage technology, the SSD technology is still experiencing tremendous growth.  Last year, the biggest SSDs were 2TB, and now they are 4TB.
Individual processors may not be getting faster at the rate they used to, but it's not unusual to see a 64-core server these days.

Population growth is exponential -- it doubles roughly every 40-50 years -- I never said it wasn't.  The important thing is that computers are getting more powerful MUCH faster than the population is getting larger.
Sometime around 1977, the company I worked for got its first hard drive, a 5MB drive that cost thousands of dollars.  The population of the Earth was around 3-4 billion.  So if you wanted to store 1 byte for every person alive, it would have cost millions of dollars.
Today a 15TB disk, 30 million times larger, costs $499 on Amazon Prime.  The population of the Earth is around 7 billion.  So you could store 2,000 bytes for every person alive for just $499.
20 years from now, you should be able to store megabytes of information, or several thousand Bitcoin transactions, for every person on Earth for less than $1000.
All because the two exponential growth rates have different exponents!

We need to put to bed the notion that investing in Bitcoin is somehow bad.
Bitcoin is still in the inflation and development phase, where early supporters are rewarded with coins at prices that, if the Bitcoin project succeeds, will some day seem astoundingly cheap.
There are many ways to participate.  You can invest time and money in mining, you can develop products and services around Bitcoin, you can tell everyone you know, and you can contribute money by buying and holding bitcoins.
Investing in Bitcoin is similar to investing in a small, start-up company.  The miners sell some of their mining rewards to get the fiat they need to pay for their time and expenses.  You provide that critical capital, and take on the risk and potentially huge rewards essentially by owning a piece of the project, the bitcoins themselves.
Another valid way to contribute is to spend and replenish, rewarding merchants who accept Bitcoin.  This exercises the infrastructure and gets the adoption ball rolling.
We need investors, users, and evangelists.  All of these activities are good for Bitcoin!

If Bitcoin is successful, the transaction growth rate will be huge in the short term.  However, in the long-term, there is no reason for the transaction growth rate to significantly exceed the human population growth rate.
The vision you seem to be lacking is the ability to see a future, perhaps 10-20 years in the future, where Bitcoin is used for practically everything, hobby computers are powerful enough to easily handle the entire blockchain, and transaction growth rates are roughly proportional to human population growth rates.
It's all about the exponents.  Computer power has growth rates with exponents on the order of 1.14, while the human population has growth rates with exponents on the order of 1.014.  And that tiny difference in exponents is what makes Bitcoin brilliant!

It ABSOLUTELY is in the white paper:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-[hash]-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
"[Mining nodes] vote with their [hash] power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

I think your problem is a lack of vision.  Computer processing speeds, storage, and bandwidths are still increasing at ridiculous rates, on the order of doubling every two years, while human population doubles only every 40-50 years.  Time is on our side!  What today might seem to require a "data center" will be trivial for a hobby computer 10-20 years from now.
Imagine that Bitcoin was adopted as the legal tender for some country tomorrow, and the blocksize instantly jumped to 100MB.  That's 14.4GB per day, or 5TB per year.  My full node computer currently has 2TB of disk space, so I would either need to upgrade or start pruning.  Since Bitcoin is my passion, I would happily pay the $499 for a 16TB external disk drive on Amazon.  This would allow me to hold the entire blockchain for at least 3 more years.  By that time, there will probably be at least 32TB drives available, buying me another 3 years, etc.
And don't talk to me about bandwidth, either.  We have screaming fast internet, my Bitcoin node is using an insignificant percentage of that bandwidth, and I'll upgrade if necessary.  There are basically two kinds of people in the world today -- those who have the resources to run a full node, and those who do not.  And the difference between 1MB and 100MB blocks isn't going to significantly change who falls into each category.  
If through some awesome miracle Bitcoin is globally adopted in the next 5 years, and the blocks grow to be 1GB each, a tiny fraction of my hodlings will buy me a server in a data center for running my "hobby" full node.  Bitcoin will still be my passion.
As long as computers keep getting more powerful at a much faster rate than the human population grows, it keeps getting easier and easier to run a full node.

I appreciate your question.  I looked up the definitions to make sure I had it right:
* Exponential growth is defined as "growth of a system in which the amount being added to the system is proportional to the amount already present: the bigger the system is, the greater the increase."  Doubling every 40 years meets that definition, since the amount being added to the system is proportional to the current amount.
* "Linear growth means that it grows by the *same amount* in each time step."  If the human population increased by 4 billion every 40 years, that would be linear growth.  (The graph would be a straight line.)

Because at its heart, the fundamental purpose of SegWit is to convert Bitcoin from a peer-to-peer electronic cash system to a settlement layer.  The result would be that the "new banks" collect the bulk of the transaction fees instead of the miners, making Bitcoin less secure.  Miners would be idiots to support this ill-hatched scheme.  Users and businesses, too.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:03:52
SegWit is an attack on Bitcoin by Blockstream Corp.  SegWit would make Bitcoin less secure by funneling the transaction fees away from the miners and giving them to organizations like Blockstream, who run software (for which Blockstream has applied for parents) that moves transaction off-chain.  Bitcoin was designed to eventually reward the miners for securing the network through transaction fees, but Blockstream wants to take the bulk of those fees for themselves.  As a result, mining will be less profitable, and Bitcoin will therefore be less secure.
Our best hope is that the miners act in their long-term best interest and reject SegWit.

Interesting.  Maybe all that experimenting with port forwarding didn't help at all.  It was only after I figured how to configure the Windows 8 firewall that I finally got more than 8 connections.

The bankers don't want the competition, which is why they funded Blockstream Corp and gave them a mandate to kill the "peer-to-peer electronic cash" aspect, and convert Bitcoin into just a settlement layer for payment processors.

That's like saying, there is one social media to rule them all, it's called MySpace.
Whether Bitcoin stays on top depends on the outcome of the scaling debate.
If the bankers succeed at converting Bitcoin into only a settlement layer for third party payment processors (i.e., the new banks), then ETH will probably take over the role of peer-to-peer electronic cash for all of mankind.  Or perhaps Monero or Dash.

Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin just at the time when computers were just barely starting to be ready to handle the required amounts of data.  10 years earlier, and computers and networks would not have been up to the task.  OTOH, computers 20 years from now will have 1000 times the capabilities of today's computers, and storing all the world's financial transactions on a hobby computer will be a trivial task.
Note that I'm not saying that all scaling will be on-chain forever, and BU is not opposed to on-chain scaling.  We just think that off-chain scaling should compete with on-chain scaling on a level playing field, and SegWit is *far* from a level playing field.  I believe that SegWit is the wrong answer, and I think we should stick with on-chain scaling until a better solution is found.  For example, I understand that FlexTrans has many of the advantages of SegWit, but without fewer downsides.

If it is globally adopted as a currency, then it is the logical choice for use as a reserve currency, at least until fiat disappears altogether.
I've been asked frequently over the years what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is.  I answer that it's the ability to send value across the internet, fast, cheap, secure, and without the permission or fees of any third party.  Sadly, the bankers have temporarily hijacked Bitcoin, and it's not currently able to fill that role.  Time will tell which way Bitcoin goes from here: peer-to-peer electronic cash as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, or a settlement layer for banks as envisioned by banker-owned Blockstream Corp.

Agreed.  SegWit is an attempt by the bankers to remove the "peer-to-peer electronic cash" aspect, and convert Bitcoin into a settlement layer between third parties (effectively, the new banks).  Reading between the lines, they want to descry Bitcoin by taking away its biggest use case, peer-to-peer payments.
So far, the banks are winning, as Blockstream has successfully blocked the stream of transactions, driving businesses away from Bitcoin and to Ethereum and other altcoins.  If SegWit activates, Bitcoin is lost.

Anyone who bought more than 2-3 weeks ago and held on through the various ups and downs is now up, so if you're now down, then you must have bought near the top of the latest run up.  That was an unlucky choice of entry point.
You can make a lot of money on Bitcoin by buying and holding for the long term.  The people who lose money are those who buy in a panic after it goes up, then sell in a panic after it goes down.  Don't be one of those.
In fact, you could do just the opposite, and increase your investment now that the correction seems to be over.  You'll make more money if you switch to a strategy of buying low, holding for several years, then selling high.
Bitcoin goes through cycles: amazing rallies, spectacular corrections, volatility, sideways movement, repeat.  It looks like we've probably finished with the high volatility for now and are starting the sideways movement.  Because this was a big crash, it might be a couple of months before we see another amazing rally, or, since the fundamentals have not significantly changed, the next rally might start fairly soon.

Mining isn't worth it any more, as there are currently too many people doing it.  CPU mining became unprofitable long ago, and GPU mining recently became unprofitable as the market was flooded with ASICs.  Usually you make more money buying and holding bitcoins than purchasing mining rigs.  I did double my investment by buying a BFL mining rig, but I would have made five times more just by investing that money in bitcoins.
Altcoins are a waste of time, as they are not the currency of the future.  They are nothing but an annoying distraction.
Don't buy in a panic when it seems like you have missed the train.  When you start to believe there will NEVER be another correction, that bitcoin is headed straight for the moon with no rest stops, that's the WORST time to buy.  However, when all seems bleak, kinda like today when the price is half what it was a month ago, THAT is the best time to buy.  Right now.  Invest between 1% and 10% of your net worth in bitcoin today!
Plan on holding for the long term.  Never sell in a panic during a major correction.  The best way to lose money on bitcoin is to buy after a major rally, then sell after a major correction.
Don't try to time the tops and bottoms.  They depend on the media reports, which depend on events you cannot predict, like announcements by central banks and hedge fund managers.  Just buy and hold.
Don't hold fiat or bitcoins in online wallets or on exchanges for very long.  Send fiat there, buy the coins, then immediately move them to an encrypted wallet on your own PC -- with a strong password and backup disks and passwords in a safe deposit box.  Exchanges and online wallets can get hacked and disappear overnight.
Invest in anti-virus software!  If you have more than $10,000 worth, spend a few hundred on a low-end PC.  Put your coins in an Armory offline wallet, and NEVER connect your offline computer to the Internet.  Any computer on the Internet can be hacked.  (If you don't have $10,000 worth, buy $1,000 worth and wait a year.)
Don't plan on dollar cost averaging by accumulating a bit at a time.  It's going up too fast for that.  Buy as much as you can afford to lose -- preferably between 1% and 10% of your net worth -- and hold it for several years at least.  The ones who will get really rich are those who do not sell too early.
Coinbase is pretty good, but if you're in the U.S., you might wind up getting more coins per dollar, faster, at CampBX (based in Atlanta, GA).

I hope lots of readers learn from your mistake!
I initially only invested 1% of my net worth in bitcoin, and an encrypted Bitcoin-QT wallet seemed safe enough.  But as the value kept growing, I eventually decided it wasn't secure enough any more.
So I recently spent less than 1 BTC to buy a low-end laptop which is permanently disconnected from the Internet and holds the bulk of my bitcoins, with backup disks in the safe deposit box.  I'm using Armory, which provides the right mix of security and convenience for me -- highly secure and only slightly inconvenient.
I know some day we'll have excellent hardware wallets, but a permanently offline PC seems to be the best answer right now.

I love my iPhone and iPad, but I'm not buying anything else from Apple until they allow multiple, competing, fully featured Bitcoin wallets on their devices.
It's a matter of principle.  My money, my phone, my tablet, my choice!

- There will be many major news stories, both positive and negative, and the media will seriously exaggerate the importance and meaning of them all, as well as garbling all the details.
- There will be dozens of new exchanges opened, dozens of headline-producing thefts, and dozens of existing exchanges closed.
- There will be several wild rallies and major collapses, all caused by sensationalist reporting.  Each peak will be higher than the previous one, and the price will exceed $10,000 by the end of the year.  The media will still be calling it tulips and predicting a total collapse.
- Venture capitalists will shower Bitcoin businesses with money.  There will be a dizzying array of new products and services, most if them mediocre.
- Several more governments will ban Bitcoin outright, or set up huge roadblocks to its usage.  The headlines from these will be responsible for several major crashes.
- Many vendors who are now starting to accept Bitcoin will stop, partly because there are too few consumers actually buying things with bitcoins, and partly because the infrastructure isn't yet ready for prime time.
- Central banks will continue to secretly accumulate bitcoins as part of their reserves.  Rich investors will buy, while governments will continue to make it difficult for ordinary people to get in.  In this way the rich will be certain to remain richer than everybody else.
- One year from today the media will still be saying it's highly risky, volatile, and probably a bubble, and the ordinary man on the street will believe them.

My BFL was 6 months later than promised, did not perform to specs, consumed 3 times the power it was supposed to, and died after less than a month.  The only good thing I will say is that you know that this low-quality hardware is not going to burn your house down when it's back at the factory being repaired.

I bought a 60 Gh/s miner from BFL, and it stopped working after less than a month.  They repaired it, and I'm just waiting for it to break again.  Their units are poorly designed and don't hold up.

I believe ultimately the best thing you can do is to change your buying habits to favor bitcoin-friendly merchants, and actually pay in Bitcoin.
It's bad for the movement if merchants say they went to a lot of trouble to set it up, and no one uses it.  We want merchants saying they are happy because it has increased their sales.  That will encourage other merchants to hop aboard.
