Very nice UI. Impressed. These guys know what they are doing.

Every sketchy ad on bitcointalk. Most is scam, rigged casinos / dice sites, fishy "investment" sites etc.
They pay the best though.

I didn't know you guys were so concerned about the chess engines.
I am going to give you some perspective why I personally think this is not a problem.
Currently we support only lower time controls, e.g 3+0. It's almost impossible to cheat this way if you enter the moves by hand. Most "average" engine-user are already out of business now. Of course there are people who enter the moves by a machine. This requires programming skills. LiChess does a pretty good job by detecting unnatural moves. As an engine user you need to mix up the move times you gotta feed the engine with natural moves etc. If you actually follow a suspected cheater for more then 10 games you are going to catch him eventually and you won't win a tournament as noname with less then 20 wins.
If there are some new fresh accounts which play bullet / blitz like a 2600 with unnatural moves, ultra fast captures etc. we will certainly find them. You don't play like that without having a backround.
I can't prove anything right now, we will talk about that again after both upcoming tournaments.
**People and organisations are scared of online chess tournaments with money involved, we are not.**
I left Thibault ( inventor of lichess ) a message, maybe he is going to say something about the anti engine system.
**It's not LiChess or BitChess alone who is responsible for this community. Every legit / fair player should report any suspicious activity immediately. We invest money from our own pockets because we believe in it.**

It happens occasionally, you are right.
It's not easy to configure an engine to make natural looking moves in this short time. You will need to win at least 20 games to get cash prize and most of the engine player are unknown + fresh registry date.
I suppose this is fairly easy to detect. The LiChess team is excelent in detecting engine cheater.
This was our first tournament, the top 20 are well known players.

The original thread in the chess subreddit is here:
We use "bits" instead of "bitcoin". It looks more appealing.

It wasn't your BTC anymore.
BTC.com gifted you that BTC.
