Yes, but it is not about centralized vs. full-node-on-every-laptop. DPOS (like in EOS) uses only 21 full nodes, which are voted by token holders. (Any of them misbehaving is supposed to be voted out). This is an extremely scalable solution, because those 21 nodes can be supercomputers. Whether this solution can be compromised more easily than BTC? This is a very complex and deep debate, neither is trivially worse than the other. Time will tell: I diverisfy between BTC and EOS (and to a smaller extent to DASH)

I agree. Further BTC dominance is most probable because the most dominant use case for crypto is store of value and BTC absolutely dominates there because of network effects and other reasons. Some solid alts have a chance of going up significantly though. DASH is a loaded spring imho (respendable instantsend - which is a cool technology based on long living quorums - just came out and DASH price in BTC is as low as Jan 2017). I am 80% BTC and 20% DASH now.

Good articles but I don't think these concepts can be explained to a 5 year old.
In my introductory article I say that I explain bitcoin and modern bitcoin wallets to a crypto novice tech savvy person in 15 minutes. I think my article is similar in complexity as yours although I concentrate more on the workings of wallets and less on the core protocol:

Good info, but the 'programming language' part does not make sense. I guess C++ at bitcoin means that the infrastructure and wallets are written mostly in C++. I don't know in which programming language the Libra infrastructure and wallets are written in (maybe C++?) but definitely not in MOVE, which is the smart-contract language on the Libra network.

I cannot beleive that we are still discussing retail purchases with bitcoin. Please try to think ahead of time: If network effects do not stop, bitocin price goes like 2x, number of bitcoin holders go like 4x, what do you think the transaction fee will be? A brutal fee race will begin so that people can at least withdraw funds from exchanges. At the point when more people need to withdraw than it is place in 1Mbyte, the fee can go 3-400 dollars: the limit will be literally that poorer people will simply not invest or will store their bitcoin on exchanges. That we need lighting network to use bitcoin as a currency is no question, but we also need 2Mbytes blocks urgently to keep bitcoin network effects rolling, and not letting altcoins take over. We are in the middle of the biggest crypto growth in history and bitcoin cannot grow because of its ridiculously small block size. (Disclaimer: I have too much invested to put everything in one basket, so while I have a very significant BTC holding I hedge it with scalable altcoins. (Not Bcash, that is quite a poor altcoin, more like Dash, EOS...))
Why I still HODL? Because I have faith that 2Mbyte will happen soon (segwit2x fork or something), and we can grow further.

And until then we need 2MB blocks. Most people on this subreddit don't understand that the current fees are nothing compared to what fees could come if 2x people will start to use bitcoin. Hint: the fees don't go up linearly with users, as there will be a race to put the most necessary transactions (like exchange withdrawals) on the network. Also even with lighting network poor people will not be able to even open a lighting channel, which is a bitcoin transaction... Did anyone of the No2X folks make a serious analysis on future fees in case of 2x, 4x, etc... user growth? The network effects of BTC have clearly stopped because people just started to realize the reality of race for fees in case of a 1MB blocksize. And they don't even understand what it means in case of a 2x, 4x userbase growth from now.

My main holding is BTC, my other holdings are EOS and DASH. I strongly beleive that the world needs a digital gold, a digital store of value. This is the most realistic use-case to make cryptocurrencies mainstream. This cryptocurrency must be extremely secure, battle-tested, and socially accepted as bein the ONE. This is bitcoin.
The question of how people will pay in their life is different. Maybe they pay with fiat for a while. Maybe they use a cryptocurrency specially optimized to be cash, like Dash (having instasend and private send, better scalability, etc...). Maybe people will use the lighting network. This is instant also. Maybe people wil use EOS, the blockchain with hundreds of thousands of tx/sec and one sec confirmation time. Maybe they will use all these. But these other networks will all have atomic swaps with the bitcoin network, and people will store their savings in bitcoin. Why is my vision a bad idea? Doubleing the size of the blocks will not reach someting like EOS's scalability. Bitcoin don!t have to compete there. Bitcoin must be absolutely secure, tamperproof and the most decentralized coin possible. That gives its value. Being yet another payment coin does not make it special. Bitcoin Cash is for example absolutely inferior to coins like Dash, and I do not understand what its value is other than it stole the Bitcoin trademark.

Agree, but I have upvoted the op because it advises to keep calm and do not panic-sell, which is always good advice.

Insightful article. I added a link to in my article. Thanks for the suggestion, I did not know that sub before.

I would suggest using the Ledger Nano X.
Here is my introductory article to bitcoin with emphasis on wallet security:
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:03:41
Can you provide some links? (Were those ordered from ledger directly?)
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:43:38
Thanks! I will consider changing/adding links after I gather more feedback. Marketcap is a misleading metric, but at least better than price (when some beginners buy a currency because the price of one coin is some cents not considering the total supply.) Maybe I will try to write another article about why markecap is misleading, how it can be manipulated, etc...

Which cryptocurrencies do you see adopted in Venezuela? I hear that BTC is adopted obviously, I read that the DASH guys are also concentrating on Venezuela but I am curious what the percentages are.
