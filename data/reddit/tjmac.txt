So you’re prioritizing a potential problem in the year 2140 over $30 fees today as not reckless, but sound wisdom. Makes sense. Good luck in that speculative market, Michel.

Bitcoin Cash and altcoins in general are grabbing market share daily. Luckily, we have genuine alternatives today to one monolithic vision. With 1299 competitors, I’m certain some will possibly go right as well.
But remind me in 120 years if I’m wrong. I’ll gladly eat crow. If the worms haven’t eaten me first. ;)

How much was 1.5625 btc worth 10 years ago?

 all of this is not even factoring in the motivations of the miners, and the fact that hashpower is sufficiently concentrated that those motivations really matter..."
Bitcoin has now officially mirrored the very 2008 banking crisis it was created to fight against.

That trade literally took me five minutes. Looked at chart, spent $20 for five shares, sold after it doubled... limit buys and sells make it practically effortless. Check out Robinhood. It's awesome, zero commission fees!
I love Bitcoin. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Make money in stocks, invest the profits in BT, gold and yes, some S&amp;P 500 growth funds. 
As Marx once wrote, "It doesn't take much time to do this, and, if you are willing to risk a little bit, you can grasp money away from your opponents."

Cooperating people *often* make better decisions than governments.

I find researching the technology and risks associated with mutual funds, market-linked index funds, robo-advisors, high-frequency trading, RSI indicators, exponential moving averages, Roth IRAs, 401Ks, TIPPS and the 1929 and 2008 stock market crashes to be just about – if not more – complex than understanding and using Bitcoin securely at a basic level.

And that's how one fixes the fundamental problem in *authoritarian* communism, by allowing one person, one vote to be a foundational principle. Thus turning it into *libertarian* communism. Not just in the political sphere, but in the economic one as well. Otherwise, one will end up buying off the other. Which leads to the majority becoming sock puppets, but ran by just a handful of political users with HUUUGE economic sway.

Expert fallacy.
Blockbuster and Netflix once had 1000-to-1 share prices. Sometimes, superior technology wins out.

Yep. With Robinhood's 0% commission fees, I guess one could argue it's even easier/cheaper.
Still like the idea of Bitcoin doing its own thing though.

1. Install app. 
2. Create account. 
3. Add bank/cc info.

I imagine an index fund through Vanguard. About the most conservative way to earn 9-10% a year, based on 100 years of trading. Look up John C. Bogle, for those interested.

Unfortunately, this exact attitude was what led to the $30,000 day trading rule in the stock market (your account must have that much in it or you can’t buy and sell in the same day more than 3 times a week). Too many little guys got their lunches ate.
