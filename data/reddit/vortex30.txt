Deflationary demographics, for one.
This scenario can not and will not last forever, of low interest rates, high debt, and low inflation. At one point the demographics will switch back to being inflationary, or enough people will start taking enough profits from their inflated stocks and homes, driving up consumer prices with all that extra money chasing the products, instead of chasing the assets like we've seen the last 10 years.

So now that China has set up the gold-backed Yuan exchanges for oil... Your answer to that is....? US can only bully small countries with weak militaries into doing as it pleases. Not countries that can put up a reasonable fight, because the US population's appetite for a total war with a capable, modern enemy is basically non-existent. Even after all of Trump's rhetoric. A war of attrition wouldn't be stomached by US population for more than a couple weeks. Look how much backlash there was over Iraq, which saw 4,500 US troops killed over a decade. Imagine that many lost each day for weeks...
You could point to the trade war as a first step of trying to dissuade or bring about the destruction of a future Petro Yuan. But the fact that they haven't acted as aggressively against China, who has gone further towards ending its reliance on USD for oil trade, as it acted against Libya and Iraq, shows that it is really only willing to take on in a war scenario much weaker foes in order to keep USD hegemony, it won't fight a capable foe for that end.
Also keep in mind that the UK/GBP had reserve currency status until the 50s or so, maybe early 60s, whenever the Suez Crisis occurred, and it was the UK's unwillingness to go to war over that crisis that many view as the end of the GBP reserve status. Its not like losing reserve status totally destroyed the GBP or the UK, but it did lead to decades of sub-par economic activity that's for sure. Obviously the UK was in decline for a long time before that, but when we look back on history in 50 years and maybe USD loses reserve status in that time, we may point to events like dot-com bubble, war on terror and expansion of debt, followed by Financial Crisis and further expansion of debt, followed by Trump, tax cuts at the top of an economic expansion and *further* expansion of debt, as chief reasons for its downfall. As well as not taking on China when it became clear that it was working to set up an alternative unit of exchange for oil.

Sure, in Libya and Iraq we saw this happen, when they were considering moving to the Euro. But China has shown that the US can only force small nations to trade oil in their currency, now that China has set up a Yuan based exchange, the gig is up, cat is out of the bag. More will likely follow with time, or simply switch to the Yuan exchange if it suits them best.

Pray tell how many BTC there are vs. how many dollars? What matters is market cap really, not the value of a single unit. I'm sure someone could create a crypto currency of which just one exists of it, people buy/sell decimals of it as that's the only way it can possibly be bought/sold, and it could maybe be worth $20,000 USD / coin, maybe even $1,000,000 / coin (the only coin, that is, its market cap).... But its not better than the USD simply because of that, or something... If that's a point you're trying to make here, I'm not even sure what that first sentence is getting at or the point of it...?

Imagine you're a business that operates only in BTC, but has to pay taxes in USD at the end of the year/quarter. Let's use sales tax as an example, I know there's not federal sales tax in the USA at least I don't think there is, but some states have it and we have it federally in Canada and a lot of countries.
So you have a 10% sales tax and you account for that in all your sales. You sold 1,000,000 BTC worth of product, you're doing fucking awesome, and put aside 100,000 BTC (10% of every sale at time of the sale) to pay the tax man their 10% at the end of the quarter/year. But wait, what's this?! It's Feb/March 2019 (2018 tax season) and BTC just lost 80% in the last 12 months! You go to convert your 100,000 BTC but it doesn't satisfy your tax bill in USD, you actually need to convert 300,000 to 500,000 or whatever BTC (hard to calculate, because obviously all sales didn't happen at the top, most happened somewhere in between) to USD to pay the taxes owed, because your chosen currency lost significant value vs USD. This is why a business would prefer to make sales and hold their revenue/capital in the currency in which it owes the taxes in, because it is far more predictable how much they need to put aside to pay their taxes and they *know* that that amount will be sufficient, and anything else can be used for expansions/profits to shareholders, or whatever. Businesses need to plan for the future.
The business in question here, despite having a phenomenal year just lost all their profits, maybe went bankrupt entirely if they decided to expand aggressively in this time, because their currency of choice lost a ton of value against the currency they owed in.
Of course the opposite could happen too, and if you're a crypto bull you do expect the opposite to happen most years, and that'll work out really well for the business... But it just takes one bad year to absolutely ruin a business, especially a smaller business (not used in my example clearly lol), or one that is aggressively expanding.
I'm not saying having to pay taxes in a certain currency is sufficient for that currency to maintain its value, especially not over long periods of time, but it does add to the compelling nature of that currency, ensures it will have a use case at least once every quarter/year, so it does help. And I think you just weren't really understanding the issues involved with doing business in one currency, and paying taxes in another.. Multi-national corporations deal with this all the time, but their benefit is that often what they lose in once currency they may gain in another in another part of the world. They also probably do the vast majority of their business in the currency in which they must pay the majority of their taxes in. They also owe mostly local taxes in the local currency in a lot of countries (especially regarding sales/corporate taxes). They also utilize tax havens and such to store their capital in, perhaps until a more ideal scenario arises such as the recent tax cuts allowing them to bring a lot of money back to the USA tax free. Stuff like that..

Honestly I think you're the one that is... Drugs should be A LOT easier to find and track down and eliminate, from requiring massive fields to grow the raw products, lots of electricity for cannabis grow-ops, laboratories and specific chemicals needed for synthesis or extraction, then MOVING tonnes of the drugs across borders, through customs, etc. Then distributing them through neighbourhoods where literally everyone in the city including the cops knows they are there in massive quantities...We've been fighting that war for nearly 100 years, yet here we are, unable to make a dent in it, just making it worse, and finally getting to the point of saying "fuck it, legalize/decriminalize, treat addicts, etc." in a lot of countries. 
Yet you think something that can be run on ANY computer anywhere in the world with a couple clicks of a button, with immediate pay-offs not needing to step outside your front door even, will be "easy" or "possible" even to shut down? Miners will start popping up in Africa, or countries that haven't criminalized it. And it will be LUCRATIVE for those who do take the risk even in criminalized countries. Just like fentanyl is still being synthesized in massive quantities in china, despite them banning it, and having such a big police state/lack of privacy. Yet they sell fentanyl and all manner of shit that is banned online. Not even on the darkweb, they're on the clearweb and use What'sApp lmao... Search "made-in-China".
The governments of the world aren't stopping this with force, their only chance is propaganda and preventing mass adoption.

Black market loves crypto and will always use it, and whether this sub likes it or not, is THE main use for the currency currently even with it legal to buy coffee and crap with it, no, most transactions are either just speculative trades, or drug dealers and money launderers, etc.
Also people fleeing countries/currencies that are collapsing, easier to transport and take out the country than gold/silver. They're not really worried about buying anything with it directly, just make it so their buying power doesn't immediately disintegrate, and so they can get some of that buying power out the country with them. Lots of Venezuelans did this. Could actually explain some of the bull run in 2017 as their currency was collapsing then and the wealthy I'm sure knew what was happening and their best courses of action. Only the poor were left holding the bag of the worthless currency, I'm sure the rich transitioned to gold/silver, USD, and crypto in 2015-2017.
Man, I'm not even a crypto bull or true believer, I prefer gold/silver, but there do seem to be a lot of people here that are awfully bearish on the future of BTC..

Currently there aren't a ton in a standard savings account. But this is an unsustainable time we live in and has only been so since the financial crisis. Historically over the last 317 years, well over 1.7% was the norm.

I'm not talking about getting back the money you invested, I'm talking about taking some profits now. Like, 50% of your profits. Be greedy with the rest and hope for $100,000s / BTC in the future to make you ultra wealthy, but in the mean time secure yourself a nice little nest egg today. If BTC is as amazing as you people believe it to be, then whether you leave 50% or 90% today, really won't make a difference when 1 BTC is worth 200,000 dollars now will it? But at least you have half of what it is worth today, guaranteed forever.

Hyperinflation =/= inflation. The inflation of the GBP over the last 317 years is totally ideal. If you're just holding currency in cash under your mattress, then you deserve to lose purchasing power over time, because you're literally harming the economy by bringing down velocity of money. Either invest it or spend it or at least put in a bank account for some interest (which will offset some, or historically actually outpace inflation) so the bank can invest / loan it.
A healthy level of inflation keeps the economy rolling by incentivizing investment and spending. Hyperinflation is government robbery.

It's different things though, they're very related yes, but they are independent measures. People hold and save when times and the future are uncertain. Printing money does not always result in price inflation. We saw this during the financial crisis, because people were scared. Better example is Germany during WW1, they printed a lot of money but everyone was scared, plus the whole war thing, velocity of money was down, and prices didn't go up at all. When the war ended, people started to feel better about the future, velocity of money went up, and then prices suddenly springshot up. Then as you said, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. But my point is money printing doesn't *always* cause velocity to go up. Also, sometimes velocity can rise without money printing, and we see inflation of prices despite no inflation of currency. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:22:52
Ok well that changes your examples considerably...
Currently there are few banks accounts that yield 1.7%+ on an unlimited amount of money. But historically well over 1.7% was the norm, and this low interest rate environment is probably completely unsustainable so high interest savings accounts will return some day. In the meantime a good place to get over 2% is US 90 day bonds. Only catch is they have your money for 90 days, but if you stagger your buys every 15 days then you have bonds maturing every 2 weeks to regain access to your money pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:51:11
If hyperinflation ever hit, they'd probably just introduce a new currency partially backed by gold, promise to do better with debts in the future, return interest rates to historically acceptable levels and voila! The slow decline of fiat currency begins anew.
The death of the GBP or USD doesn't mean suddenly crypto gets its turn. They'll do all they can to avoid something they don't control being the currency

That's a technical definition of inflation. Colloquially though, everyone considers it as prices rising, which is a combination of printing money *and* velocity of money. If no one is spending the money that gets printed, prices won't rise.

That's not true at all, they are marvelous conductors and are used widely in industry, from automation to electronics/computers. If better conductors existed for those jobs, then they'd be used, because silver and gold aren't exactly cheap. But no alternatives exist that are affordable, clearly. 
Silver and gold have real, intrinsic value. Plus they are traditionally used in jewellery for thousands of years in every corner of the world, and that trend isn't going anywhere. Also historically used as money, and its possible that trend could return too.

These comments are refreshing on this sub. I don't come here much, but it seems this pullback has caused some rationality and mature investor mindsets to finally come about. Rather than Bitcoin being a guaranteed world-changer and all of us becoming insanely wealthy, perhaps it will be, but also perhaps we were all wrong and it was just a massive bubble, will have utility for criminals and other than that, fairly little use case and thus a price around $500-1000 may be more apt than $1,000,000+ like some people, somehow, believe.
I'm not as much of a denier as this post gives off, I actually find crypto fascinating and I'd rather see it at $1,000,000 than $500-1,000. It's just that both are perfectly reasonable possibilities. $0 is not reasonable though. Peter Schiff is 100% wrong on that one. It will always have value to criminals, always.
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:02:24
It is the criminal use case that will ensure BTC doesn't go to zero. But largely I agree with you. I think $250-1000 is a more realistic range if this indeed becomes the only real use for crypto/bitcoin.

Presumably you'd stash at least half somewhere in case of robbery and what have you, plus ya, it is heavy. So too is ammunition which I see everyone on here going crazy about... So... Are we mobile on foot, or are we hunkering down in our homes? Because anything over 200 rounds of ammunition is also going to weigh you down and be a waste of calories to carry around... If I had to choose between 30,000 rounds of surplus ammunition, or $10k of silver, I'd choose neither and buy half of both, no matter the scenario.. Hell... I'd buy 2,000 rounds and the rest in silver... Like c'mon, people here have obviously never held a case of 1,000 rounds surplus ammunition. It is very heavy... And that's for a hunkering down scenario. If we're mobile on foot, you don't want more than 100 - 200 rounds of ammunition, so may as well have silver..

If you have $10,000 to spend, it would be fucking retarded to spend all $10,000 on ammo. Ammo is heavy as hell first off, you're not carting around 1000s of rounds of ammunition. So buy 200 - 300 rounds, practice your fucking aim every week with a reliable rifle, go with a scoped bolt action so you don't get carried away with a semi-auto or something..
Then spend money on lots of food and water and water filters/cleaners and other survival goods like fire sticks (can start a fire even when wet) and like binoculars, good sleeping bag/tent, all this stuff... But you should also probably get a few $1000 in silver as well, because you never know. Maybe it WILL have value to someone you come across, and maybe he has something you want.
There's no reason to not be diversified.

And before someone chimes in "then why didn't UAE collapse when oil prices fell?" it's because they have cheap to extract and cheap to refine oil. Venezuela's oil is largely under the ocean floor and requires a lot more capital to extract. Basically UAE oil remained profitable while Venezuelan (and Canadian) oil become unprofitable. And Canada did ok of course because we have a very diversified economy. But the province of Alberta has suffered greatly from falling oil prices since 2014.

Honestly, these days, stocks and bonds are just backed by whatever the fuck the rich want their price to be because globally banks and central banks and corporations (doing buybacks) are flush with cash. P/E ratios are insane, even in non-growth stocks... Stocks with no earnings and massive losses are flying so high. It is a massive bubble (that or inflation is picking up and up and up despite the Fed's skewed numbers showing otherwise...Venezuela had the best performing stock market the last few years let's recall..).
$16 trillion worth of debt worldwide is yielding negative rates yet the rich keep buying it up (even if deflation IS coming, it makes more sense to just hold currency than a negative yielding bond...). Why is anyone buying this debt, other than the fact that the elite want it to stay that way?
It's all fucked up and thinking any of this is backed by a company's cashflow (with measly dividend yields, in many cases profitable companies with no dividends but lots of stock buy backs) or the faith and credit of governments around the world is just asinine. At these levels, its all just backed by whatever the elite want it to be at, and it'll stay that way until the elite decide it shall no longer stay that way.
There's going to be a massive move one way or the other soon, whether we see hyper-inflation or this debt bubble finally collapsing and massive deflation... Something will change massively in the next 10 years. Personally, I don't think these governments are interested in seeing deflation ever happen, look at Japan with its central bank owning over 50% of all ETFs (I think its in the 70s actually), and how that government approached its deflationary demographics... Europe and North America are about to go through that same issue... But we have massive debts and trade deficits, whereas Japan went into their crisis with government surpluses, tons of individual savings, and a trade surplus (which has remained throughout the deflationary period). This all greatly helped Japan and they got off *easy* (despite the fact if you look at their markets over the last 30 years... Yeah....) ... We don't have those tailwinds... We're going to have to print way, way more money if we want to avoid massive deflation like Japan did. Will the US dollar possibly managed to remain a reserve currency through all of that? What will losing the dollar as the reserve currency do? Who freaking knows... But I'm betting on them blowing up the entire system trying endlessly to avoid deflation at all costs (remember Mario Draghi...).

How do transactions occur once we reach full saturation?

They ain't planning to tax you or I at 90%. Unless you're extremely wealthy. I'm realistic enough to figure I'll never be in that position, and if I ever am in that position I'd see it as a sacrifice I absolutely can afford to make.
@_date: 2019-06-08 16:40:12
I'd like to believe that things will recover again after this crash, but I just think people will get in way too early and capitulate at the bottom after a 3 - 4 year down trend and massive deflation/loss of wealth. We've always seen quick/swift recoveries for stocks in our lifetimes, ever since the 80s. People expect it now. Wall Street doesn't like the average person being right, and this economy is very, very sick... So we could see a much longer down trend than most expect, taking us to levels people didn't think possible (think BELOW the 2009 lows).
The fed will helicopter drop tons of free money and hold markets and the economy up, but this time when things finally do turn around after a few years, we will face a hyper inflation, and you won't want to be in stocks/fiat denominated assets. You'll want precious metals and probably crypto.
It is so hard to know which direction it'll go. And if it does collapse in a 1930 style deflation and 3-4 year down trend, I'm not convinced it'll even be a good buying opportunity there for the long-term. I think about things like climate change, resource scarcity, increasing geo-political tensions all over the world, deflationary demographics a la Japan, along with of course just a terrible economy... So what if it just never really recovers the way we always expect it to, like WW2 / 1950s / 1960s bull run, when we had none of those head winds.
I'm just not too sure if stocks will ever be a great place to be anymore, if all those things come true.
Also, I don't see government ever backing Bitcoin, they'll want their own, controlled, digital currency that maybe takes on the same principles of Bitcoin if Bitcoin does well in the down turn and everyone starts using it. And once the government announces basically a "USDC" (US Digital Currency), I think everyone will now flock to that, the official currency of the country, just like they always do. And then eventually the government will start increasing the supply of it beyond what was initially said and we'll all be back to square one, with a digital fiat on the block chain.
Some wild predictions, probably none come true lol, but just some thoughts.
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:34:48
No I'm saying people will, and always have, accepted whatever money the authorities tell them to accept. People are generally too ignorant, and today in particular, life is too comfortable for them to care about revolutionizing the way money works. Even during hyper inflations, people kept using these failing currencies until the authorities came up with something new. Behind the scenes I'm sure many utilized assets and precious metals when fiat fails, hell some Venezuelans started utilizing crypto, which is awesome! But the vast majority are still on the failing Bolivar. 
Its great and all if you don't wish to live in a fiat system, but most people really aren't like you, or even I (not really a bitcoin afficiando, but certainly can see the problems with our system).
Then, separate point, I was stating that increasing inflation right now could actually be a net benefit by forcing the rich to spend their dollars. Money is meant to be spent and invested, not hoarded. We live in a society of money hoarders, whether it be the rich with their major piles or normal people with their retirement savings (I can't blame the normal person, they're being rational, but from a pure "what is best for the economy" standpoint, what they're doing is not best for it). Many don't have any savings either, and are instead in mountains of debt which is also crippling our economy. We need less debt, more capital investment in new ventures by the rich, and like it or not, more inflation would cause both issues to correct... Its just a matter of not over correcting into runaway inflation.

Give them a little notice and it's yours. Can withdraw your entire account. Personally, I keep a decent bit of cash on hand in case of emergency. If you believe the whole "be your own bank, individuals responsibility!" thing when it cones to crypto, then why not fiat as well? Maybe not all your fiat, that's foolish, but could keep a good portion of it at home for whatever emergencies you're imagining you'd need more than 6500 with no notice for.

Oh Ya I'd never advocate against bitcoin nor having whatever other choice in money. I keep silver/gold as a hedge, I even hold some Ethereum as well and plan to add a bit in soon! I'm just playing a devil's advocate for fiat because I do see some merits for inflation, I understand why we have the system we have, but also the merits against are of course obvious (eroding our life savings and essentially "theft" via debt). I'm not convinced crypto will have mass appeal, or at least for it to get there we need to first go through a very painful period as a society, and I'd probably prefer us not have to go through that... But I do see the possibility for that hyperinflation doomsday scenario too...
But yeah, I'm probably more on your side than not on your side, just trying to advocate for the other side and make a point that maybe it's not all evil, and probably at least, it'll be very difficult for crypto to reach mass adoption (I think there was something in your first post I replied to that eluded to mass adoption or something to that effect, so I was mostly trying to grind on that point, that I'm just not so sure we'll see it). Middle of post edit - it was actually the point about no sentient human would choose money against their interests. That point I was kinda like hmmmmm Im not too sure about that one. :p people are making so many terrible choices regarding money and debt, it's sad.. 
We will see how it all shakes out! And whatever happens, I think most on this sub reddit are extra enlightened to money and economics and that's so rare these days. So crypto has been a huge asset, if for nothing else (and obviously there have been other benefits too!).

Humans make choices that go against their interests all the time, whether it be through ignorance or being stubborn / unwilling to change. People are *incredibly* ignorant when it comes to money and the economy, especially the bottom 90%.
If you're counting on mass adoption of bitcoin due to possible downsides of our current monetary system, you're gonna have a bad time.
People hoard money way too much, specifically the rich. More inflation could be a good thing, may actually cause them to go out and buy/invest their piles of cash in new ventures rather than letting it sit dormant in stocks/bonds/etc.

Government creates budgets, budgets that have more and more and more deficits because every politician campaigns on "more services, less taxes!" essentially. As the burden of government debt grows, the CBs are influenced to keep rates lower and lower, such that the government does not default. Eventually everything comes to a head, but we're currently basically in this situation and the coming to a head moment surely can't be too far off, talking before 2030 for sure, and probably during the next recession honestly.

The idea that they picked 2% as a target has to do with that causing about 100% inflation within about 30-35 years, a fairly normal mortgage repayment time frame (maybe a bit long, but hey). Essentially this allows for even the worst of debts to be paid off eventually without much effort, especially towards the end of that debts lifecycle.
Say you get a mortgage in 2019 and you're 30 years old, and it is a bit of a burden on you "house poor". By the time you're 40 years old, you're probably making more money now, whether simply due to the 2% / year inflation, or due to you moving up in your career. Now your mortgage really isn't much of a burden, just a hassle, and you're able to put more money towards your children/family now. By the time you're 50, again you're making much more money than at 30, whether from those 2% inflations adding up, or your career progressing even more. Now your mortgage payment is pretty easy to make, and you're saving for your retirement (freedom 67, baby!). By the time you're 55-65 you've probably completely paid off your mortgage, and those last 10 years those mortgage payments were pretty easy to make, and the people in their 30s are wondering how the HELL that guy was so lucky to buy a house for $400,000 when even a small house is now $700,000+. That's the magic of inflation and debt slaves, baby! Now go strap in for some massive over-priced debt so this inflationary circus can continue, don't worry, in 10-20 years this debt really won't seem so bad.
At least, that's the theory, until *something* goes wrong and inflation can't be managed (either we get deflation or hyper inflation), and everyone is overburdened with debt for literally the rest of their lives or their life savings turn to confetti. Yay! What a system!
Also, since 1970 or so, house prices in the Greater Toronto Area are up about 2000% (my grandad bought his house in 1970 for $50,000, he sold for $800,000 in 2016, he didn't get what he should have for it, and housing continued to explode to the upside for another year, probably could have gotten 1,000,000 for it had he waited another year). Whilst inflation is only supposed to be up maybe 150-200% officially in that time... So yeah... Its all a crock of shit, there's WAY more inflation than the CBs calculate, because they focus on consumer goods like TVs and cars, stuff we only buy once every 5-10 years anyways usually, whilst ignoring shit that everyone needs such as gas (up 200% since 1997 where I live), housing (up about 200-300% since 1997 where I live), and food (up about 200-300% since 1997 where I live). I pick 1997 because that's the furthest back I can really remember prices in my life. 20 years, we're up way more than their 2% targets / year, that supposedly we couldn't even hit for the last 10 years or so, so what the fuck gives???
@_date: 2019-04-20 20:01:12
So then presumably you have lots of savings constantly losing purchasing power...?
How'd you behave in October to December? Did you sell some? How can you be so sure next time when we're down 20% or more that you'll sell when it's "real". Markets were at the cusp of breaking on Christmas Eve I'd say. We were lucky the elastic band snapped us right back up once the fed changed their tone, another few red days easily could've meant way more downside.
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:50:41
My point is the rate of inflation is way off from what they've calculated / admitted / expect. The interest rates are set wrong, and we'll likely pay a horrible price due to malinvestment (zombie companies, way too much non-productive consumer spending on debt, etc)
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:51:22
They use TV's and electronics and crap that people barely ever buy and are luxury items. When you look at things everyone actually needs to survive (food water shelter energy) it paints a way different picture. Also stocks.. Also education.. I mean, what *isn't* going up in price quickly right now? Just from your daily life, the things you see.. Because this is what I pay attention to and think matter. I don't care if a 4k tv now cost $500 when it cost $2000 a few years ago, that's technology and it always does that as supply and demand even out. 
I work in sales and purchasing. All our suppliers/vendors just raised their prices by 5 - 10% this year, and last year (robotics/automation wire and cable and other components like connectors etc)... Keep licking those boots if you actually think we're at 2% inflation.
I don't need a serious analysis when my job literally is setting prices and understanding market prices of my field, and also just living in the real world on a fairly tight budget. It's blatant.
The fed constantly gets things wrong so I trust what I see way more than what they tell me to be real.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:05:41
Yeah and literally everyone else is doing what you're doing too. I wonder how long until a minor economic event causes the floodgates to open. Look at October to December... That was all based on kind of nothing.. High interest rates / hawkish fed? Their tone may have changed but rates are exactly where they were during that whole sell off and suddenly we're back at ATH. The markets aren't really working properly right now and that should concern you.

Are you? You realize every Euro you save is also decreasing in value, right? I guess caring about inflation or not has a lot to do with your lot in life. Tons of debt and no savings? Love inflation. No/little debt, and tons of savings? Hate inflation. This explains why the average individual hardly even knows what inflation is, all they know is their debts seem to be easier to pay now, they're making "more" money and their assets are going "up" in value.

What small population will that be? Drug dealers and addicts and criminals, essentially the only people who have adopted crypto as a widespread currency. The value in crypto isn't really the deflationary forces limited upon it or its transaction speeds/fees or anything like that... It is right in the name, crypto, it is an untraceable currency (or at least really difficult to trace), this is highly sought after by organized crime, who have adopted it now, but for the average man making average transactions, we don't really care if big brother knows we bought milk and chips.

BTC solves a problem I've never heard major concerns over.
The best use case for crypto is drug dealers and other criminals. And that's a perfectly reasonable use case! I'm sure BTC will find a floor around $500 or $2000 or who knows where, thanks to these market participants. But other than them? Hmm..

I'm theory a market can go from $1 to $20k on very, very little $ volume if there is suddenly a massive increase in demand, and barely anyone selling. Can't really measure conclusively how much money would be necessary to move an asset to a certain price due to market dynamics. If there's suddenly no sellers, and lots of buyers willing to pay a lot more, prices can move incredibly quickly on very little $ volume
I mean this rarely happens, something fundamentally needs to change. Think blow out earnings reports, or when a pharmaceutical drug gets approved or maybe is unexpectedly found to cure cancer or something. Those stocks can shoot up 10s or 100s of % on basically no $ volume, simply thanks to sellers not being willing to sell below a certain price, and buyers being willing to buy up to that price. Opposite happens with fundamentally awful news.

It'd soar while people are still interested in buying... If there's no/few interested buyers, then it won't soar. In fact, so long as buyers aren't willing to chase it, don't believe it is/can be worth more, then it won't soar if everyone hodls, you'll just see volume drop off a cliff.
It is supply and demand. Just because you cut off supply, doesn't mean price goes up if there is a severe lack of demand for anyone to buy it at prices above say 4000, or whatever that price may be.
Though I agree it'd soar in the short term if suddenly everyone hodled. I'm just saying it does not *have to* and there may be an upper limit where buyers just think "ya, no... I'm not paying this price."

And your scenario 100% eliminates human nature and speculative markets, even as a thought experiment it is totally dumb, but I gave you benefit of the doubt there.. 
It 100% will lead to fewer buyers as the price goes up, due to speculation on what bitcoin is actually worth (you know, the whole reason we went from 3k to 20k and back down to 3k within a year and a half).
My point is that no sellers doesn't *have* to result in prices rising, if buyers become uninterested passed a certain price, then price simply won't move and volume will drop off a cliff. I also acknowledged this isn't gonna happen with bitcoin at this time, that it would go up. But you seem to think it'll skyrocket "soar" to, presumably, much higher than 20k? How high exactly is "soaring"? When I read that I was thinking 50 to 100k? I'm saying that's not necessarily true, at some point buyers will say no way, not without consolidation, and speculators and shorts also would pile in to the sell side. Though I'm sure your imagined scenario also presumes shorts wouldn't exist... Somehow.. 
With other assets too though, you have to understand that demand isn't always existent beyond a certain price. Just because no one is willing to sell, doesn't mean higher prices must follow. It could mean volume drops off a cliff and no price change occurs at all, with a massive gulf between bids and asks.

You act as if shit hits the fan over night...There would be a period of time, perhaps quite a long period, where the USD/fiat will be spiralling out of control and all your fiat savings will become essentially worthless, but gold will be worth A LOT (though in nominal terms it will be worth about the same as it is today in terms of buying power, maybe a little bit more though because people will view it as a store of value during this period). Now, it is during this period that the gold stackers will use up most of their gold, prepping for the eventual collapse they know is coming, buying food and water and supplies with their actual life savings that have stored its value, whilst fiat only folks will have literally nothing with which to do this with. Look to contemporary Venezuela for an example of how a gold stacker there, right now, would be living a considerably easier life than their neighbours right now, especially if they were wise and only trading in the gold for fiat as they need it. Possibly stocking up as well at this point would be wise as that place is a disaster, and probably only going to get worse in the coming months/years, I think I'd have stocked up on supplies months ago though frankly, things are really, really bad there.
If shit hit the fan as badly as you outlined though, you'd be a hell of a lot better off with gold, than with crypto currency you can't even buy that many goods and services with right now, and when things get really, really bad you wouldn't even be able to access crypto if/when there is no electricity. Sure, when there's looting and chaos the gold will be worthless, it may even be a liable for someone trying to loot it off of you. But once the pieces are slowly being picked back up again, you know gold will be THE currency of choice yet again. It is why many people who stack gold also stack a decent amount of food and water, and as I said earlier, will stack even more food and water in the weeks before the chaos ensues. But keeping some gold as well for a post-chaos world when things are getting back together slowly.
If you're really expecting complete societal collapse, gold makes perfect sense. A store of value for the early days of the collapse when inflation is running out of control, so you can stock up on the things you'll need to get through the chaos, and keep some of the gold for when things are getting back to normal. Bitcoin on the other hand, I see less value in. It will probably get propped up by hyper inflation, just like every single other asset class, I just find it hard to believe people will be willing to throw so much into something which will be 100% inaccessible in a no internet and/or no electricity era, something that takes days/weeks to convert to fiat in order to buy the goods and services in the earlier days of the inflationary period, such that by the time you actually get your fiat to buy goods and services it is worth far less than when you sold the Bitcoin. And assumes your bank doesn't fail in the interim period.
The only scenario for BTC as a store of wealth in a collapsed society is some weird semi-collapse where electricity and internet are still readily accessible by all and BTC has already reached a stage where it is accepted everywhere. Under that scenario it will be a useful item in a collapsing society. Until that's true, I'll stick primarily to gold/silver for my doomsday prepping, and my cryptos to make money day trading the amazing volatility.

Not even close to 1% lol. I'm sure you know that, just saying, his example is way worse than even you give it credit for. :p

The GDP exchange is the products and services you desire my friend. Get em while they're hot.

I do have both.

I agree. A fixed amount doesn't really make sense.

Well first off I'm no supporter of Central banks, I just think they know exactly what they're doing and everything is going according to plan for them, and they can prop this up as long as they wish. Second off I only post here once every few months. I have a small investment in crypto, but I'm under no illusion that it must work out. It may work out, and if so, yay! I make money! But it just as easily could fail, and i won't be too saddened either.
I'm mostly interested in preserving my wealth, and day trading, which from time to time runs counter to that goal lol, but overall I'm pretty good at it so whatever is volatile and can give good gains quickly, I'm interested in. I do see bitcoin'main purpose at this time as a day trader and speculator'paradise, rather than as a real currency or a real store of wealth. But I wish everyone success.

If everyone is locked into the same ponzi scheme, does it continue to be a ponzi scheme? When they can digitally print billions in an instance, and countries can co-operate for a supposed greater good, IE keeping everyone a slave to their debts, whether it be household debt, or sovereign debt, etc?
I mean, I used to think like you, I still think it's a perfectly valid belief, I still hold my gold and cash close to me in case of an inevitable collapse (gold worst case scenario, cash for bank failures but similar scenario to great depression which I think is also a likely outcome rather than a complete and utter collapse)...But what if they just keep propping this scheme up, and coordinate amongst themselves (they being the central banks of the world) in order to all prop up their currency in relatively equal parts, shift to negative interest rates, whatever it takes in order to prop this system up and avoid catastrophic failure which they know would be the end of the capitalist economy, the end of central banks, the end of current government regime, etc? Because I think they've shown that working together they can pretty much overcome anything, at the expense of inflation and shittier living standards and opportunities for people like us, but continuing to shift the wealth ever more to the wealthy elite. I just feel that is more likely these days, that they're gonna do QE4, they're gonna print money endlessly and destroy our life savings whilst they buy up real assets like gold and companies and real estate (islands in the middle of the ocean, for one thing), etc. they're gonna do it in a coordinated way to prop up the whole world and keep everything status quo for as long as possible, concentrate as much wealth into as few hands, and when they're ready, on their watch, they will pull the plug suddenly and leave all of us holding worthless paper. But not until they're ready, and I don't think they quite are yet, people aren't angry enough.

No...Just the money he doesn't spend on goods and services, presumably.

Historically when countries don't have independent central banks to control rates and monetary policy, governments just spend and spend and spend with deficits and destroy the currency. I mean, not that we're doing a whole lot differently right now... But historically it was even worse than this. Governments that have to answer to the people are terrible overseers of an economy/money.
Even a gold standard can be debased. Gold bugs begging for a gold standard thinking it'll solve a ton of government spending problems are a bit naive to the past. What we need is government that doesn't spend more than it takes in, and a well educated populous when it comes to money that doesn't over leverage themselves to ridiculous levels like we have (at least here in Canada..).

Yes yes, bitcoin is very manipulated..

This happened to me today, I only really started looking into BitCoins 2 days ago. I've known about them since at least late 2011 or so but never invested. Too bad, had I invested I would've sold for sure around $200 (on the way up, not down). It was a very obvious bubble.

My chance will be in about a week or two when it is down to ~20 USD / BTC again. Right now is still a stupid time to buy in my opinion.
