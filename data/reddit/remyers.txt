I think it's fascinating that a small town bank would be tracking the development of Bitcoin.  Please ask her what risk she thinks something like Bitcoin poses in her banks particular situation.
The other currency that I think your step mother is referring to and which is discussed in Rikard's book is "[Special Drawing Rights](
SDRs are essentially the ultimate manifestation of centralized government/political currency.
I think Rikard's book is worth a read, if only for the political analysis of a monetary endgame.  His book is written for a popular audience though and is not a rigorous economic analysis.  
His attempts to sell his own credentials and (possibly exaggerated) experience related to "Project Prophesy" are off putting.  
He provides an interesting answer to the question of "what happens next" for the global financial system when few people are willing to make concrete predictions.

A good [argument can be made]( that even if profit can not be made directly from a decentralized solution, the ecosystem that the solution enables can lead to profitable opportunities.

The [Swish]( system can be used to transfer between people at different banks, and transfers are nearly instant.  It also does not allow charge backs.

Great news, and glad to seeing a decentralized exchanges get some investor interest.
One way I can see this partnership make sense is if the bank can help by creating an API to help automate the fiat side of the transfer. 
The Coinfeine system relies on making many small fiat transfers so making that process less tedious and time consuming is important to the system working.

I wonder if the Openname Auth protocol would compete with the Swedish  [BankID]( system or complement it.  BankID works in a similar way but obviously is not decentralized.

A mix of both technologies is also possible.  At low temperatures heat pumps become less efficient, but overclocked miners potentially become more efficient. 
Heat pumps typically use direct resistance heat as a backup when outside temperatures are very low already.

Having multiple decentralized exchange options is healthy for the Bitcoin ecosystem.  There is a place for LocalBitcoins and for more decentralized projects like OpenBazaar, Bitrated and Bitsquare.
The Bitcoin-OTC existed before LocalBitcoins, but LB provided an easier to use system.  People still use Bitcoin-OTC but LB opened up OTC trading to a wider audience.
OpenBazaar, BitRated and Bitsquare are all decentralized trading projects with slightly difference approaches.  The first two are more general purpose while Bitsquare focuses exclusively on currency exchange.  
A competition between different exchange models to fill different niches will only add to the anti-fragile nature of Bitcoin.

If someone pays you for your used bicycle via bank transfer, do you need to show a contract?
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:43:07
Bitsquare is open source, check out the project here:
  
It's also very early in the development still.  If there is an API though, it should be possible to integrate with it once the platform is more mature.

Our local power company also runs the residential dark-fiber network.  They obviously would want to encourage consumption of both of their products: data and energy.  A decentralized server farm does both and if the servers happen to be mining bitcoins for heat they also satisfy their mandate to encourage power efficiency.
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:12:16
Mark my words... the future of mining is as home heating.

True that escrow as a term can be misleading.  I'm not sure what a better term would be.  Maybe it can be qualified as non-custodial escrow? cosigned escrow?  
The term escrow is correct in one sense, but the mechanics are very different for escrow based on Bitcoin multisig addresses than for the traditional kind escrow people are more familiar with.

Are you charged cash advance fees?  I know most cards in Sweden are debit cards (not credit), but I'm not sure how the Circle transaction is treated.

The clear text bank details are not stored on the blockchain, only a hash of the details plus a 'secret' to prevent reverse look ups.  When you trade with someone you give them the 'secret' so they can confirm the hash matches.  
Even the arbitrator does not need to know these bank details unless they are invoked to settle a dispute.
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:47:07
OpenBazaar is a very similar project, but not specialized for currency exchange in the way Bitsquare is.   Like Bitsquare, OpenBazaar recognizes that decentralized solutions are superior to centralized solutions.

If I understand correctly, in a Hawala there are intermediaries that hold and exchange currency being transfered.  That is not how Bitsquare works.  The fiat is exchanged directly between trading parties - more similar to LocalBitcoins.
One other important difference is that the bitcoin being traded is held in a shared Bitcoin multisig account and not on someones central servers somewhere.

Close the loop and let people spend their bitcoins back to your site in exchange for highly accurate weather forecasts for their home location.
I can also imagine automated systems that might appreciate an API for accurate weather data paid for in bitcoin.

It's not an exchange unless you can put fiat in and get bitcoin out.  What I think you're talking about is more of a decentralized hedging site, which is also a very good idea.
The technology developed for Bitsquare could probably be adapted for what you describe as well; it's open source so take a look.

LocalBitcoin is doing well in Sweden.  Not a direct replacement for centralized exchanges like BTCX and Safello, but for small volume traders a reasonable alternative when big banks refuse to work with Bitcoin commercially.  In particular Swish makes for a very fast and easy way to settle and the bank giro payment system is also efficient in Sweden.
Other even more decentralized exchanges are also on the horizon, such as bitsquare.io .  I hope strong banking relationships can be maintained by the centralized exchanges, but if that fails there are decentralized solutions coming.

The applicable regulations are still unclear and it has not been tested in court how they apply to direct person-to-person trades.  My guess is that it should be similar to someone buying or selling something person-to-person.  It's a business (subject to regulation) based on the frequency and volume of the buying/selling.
For example, if I buy or sell a few used bicycles a month, it could just be a hobby.  But if it's hundreds of bikes, then I better have a business license and pay sales tax, etc.

Coinffeine does not use multsig address to hold bitcoin during settlement.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:48:24
One central entity doing escrow would be centralized; many independent entities capable of doing escrow makes Bitsquare decentralized.
Also, in Bitsquare the escrow entity does not hold the bitcoin, but only has one key of the 2 of 3 multisig address.

I think you mean an easy *decentralized* way.  
LocalBitcoins is very good and shows that person-to-person fiat for crypto w/escrow can work, but it is a centralized escrow and web site, both of which would be better if decentralized.

The charge back fraud risk can be high with this kind of exchange if the payment method allows for charge backs.  
The best solution is to settle the fiat side of the trade with a method that can not easily be charged back.  There are other safeguards that can be used, but fortunately not all payment providers allow charge backs.
LocalBitcoins has done a good job of rating different payment methods in their [Payment provider information guide](

Any link to a good discussion of known attacks on 3rd party arbitrator based security would be appreciated.  EDIT: Nick Szabo wrote an interesting analysis of [trusted third parties]( .
Bitsquare has attempted to address potential problems in their [risk analysis]( but it must also be recognized that only real world use can separate theoretical risks from actual risks.  
Initially only small amounts of value should be traded with any new system until the risk landscape has been defined through empirical testing.

An active trader might raise some flags with a suspicious bank, but someone buying small quantities (less than US$1000) to add to their savings I assume would be ok.  I assume that's how people using LocalBitcoins avoid questions from their bank.  
Having a separate bank account just for Bitcoin trading is a good idea too.

Of course you can export the bitcoin and exchange for cash USD.  I understand why someone would buy bitcoin.  But what does someone who sells bitcoin for hryvnia do with the hryvnia?  
Why would someone with bitcoin, or the USD/EUR to buy bitcoin overseas, want to exchange them for hryvnia?
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:16:33
If there are capital controls, who is taking the other side of the bitcoin trade?   Someone would have to find a way to convert hryvnia into USD or some other currency that they can use to buy bitcoin outside of Ukraine.  
Otherwise it's a one sided trade and the exchange should run out of bitcoin.
I don't buy it that there are bitcoin millionaires supplying the volume.  Unless it's as a purely humanitarian gesture.

Actually, you can keep your currency if you agree to eventually adopt the euro in the future.  Except for Denmark and the UK who got an [opt-out option]( when they joined.

In retrospect, the minimum pledge should have been lower to reflect that instead of an even distribution of 684 pledges of the same value, there would likely be a mix of many low value pledges and few big pledges.
As others have also pointed out, if the project got close to 684 pledges people could revoke their pledge and/or re-pledge a higher amount.
