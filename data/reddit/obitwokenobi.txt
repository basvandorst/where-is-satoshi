Not sure why I'm asking this, since you probably don't have a crystal ball, but when do you think that might happen? 2019?

What do we consider “retirement money” around here? As someone in his late 20s, that number for me is around mid-7 figures
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:43:03
Lol exactly. And retire on your private island.

When he’s right: “See! I’m a genius”
When he’s wrong: “Lol, just kidding bro”
Reminds me of the games we played in kindergarten for fucks sake

I went over to the_donald...ghost town. Could only find a single link with a comment in disbelief.

Yeahhhh, but can’t you say that about literally every market? A “crash” is very relative as well.

I think you have a solid point regarding the rational acting long-term hodlers all having their selling price. 
Where I think it goes into uncharted territory is the fact that this group seems to be relatively small and declining, while the other side, non-hodlers mainstream buyers trying to jump in, is expanding exponentially.

And this is why I am more and more convinced that Vertcoin might be the way to go forward

If not soon then when?

I would highly recommend a nexus over a galaxy any day of the week. The crapware that samsung fills the phones with completely ruins the experience IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:06:19
You may right but have you at least checked what it has to offer?
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:15:48
Nah bro, trends and lines and analyseses
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:44:55
Fill me in?

Or be really smart and don’t spend too much money on something that depreciates in value the moment it rolls off the lot.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:04:28
Supply shock?
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:36:42
Or be a gateway through usage. I’m not a fan of Facebook, but if commonfolk can get ZuckerCoin with their credit cards, and then to an exchange, then the Moon might be too close for where were going.
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:22:29
All in on what, if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:46:42
Lock this clown up already. At the very least, issue a gag order so I don’t have to hear his bullshit.
