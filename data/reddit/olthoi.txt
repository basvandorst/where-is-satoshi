It's already been lower than that and is holding steady around $60. You're nuts if you think it has nowhere to go. It's already been lower today.

That could be it - I could be confusing hoarders with careful consumers who want to be able to shop their way. I think the recent rise in BTC has also discouraged spending at an unsustainable rate. Once they 'flatten' and stabilize, spending them will be more appealing.
I know even I (a non investor, just someone who uses BTC to pay for whatever I can to support them) stopped spending them when every day I was just waking up to "free" money.

My favorite are the people who are now crying "where's the central authority!" and "regulation!"
To be fair, most of them are not BTC "believers" so much as people chasing a quick buck, but still, this is more or less what we asked for, this is what we got.

Everyone is going to sell. Everyone has been selling, they just haven't been able to use the largest exchange to do so.
Lots of people will sell. Some people will double down and buy, but lots more will sell. I'd predict crash pt 2 - but this is all armchair speculation, I have no express knowledge.

All those people hoarding bitcoins are not good for the bitcoin economy, sorry. Hoarding currency is very bad, especially when a few people can have a significant % of market share.
If you want to use BTC as a currency stop treating it like a get rich quick scheme or any kind of sound investment.

It's not saving because the value isn't constant. I have no political opinion about bitcoins and own some myself. Buying and leaving them dormant for months and years is not saving, it's removing currency from the economy.
You're confusing "risky gambling" with savings. There is no guarantee bitcoins will be worth anything in a week. Holding on to a pile of stocks is not savings.

Investing is investing, I don't know what to tell you. Common sense tells you that no investment is a sure thing, so you should never be gambling with money you cannot afford to lose.
If you're young and wiped out your savings, well that sucks and you took a risk (when you're young is a good time to take risks with large potential payoffs - IE working for equity in a startup). If you're older and have a family to provide for - well you don't need a lecture right now - but you have acted incredibly immaturely and irresponsibly, and your 
It's also important to remember than you never had any money when BTC were $260, if you weren't willing to sell. It all depends on what you bought them at. There are people who have still made fairly good returns even at the current price.

Bitcoins aren't stable? They're a very small market full of people and speculators who know next to nothing about economics &amp; currency exchanges?

BTC haven't been $252 at all today, so either you're lying about how much you made, lying about when you sold, or just completely full of shit.

That's not what "resources" means.

No, the Euro does not fluctuate the same way that bitcoin does. Why are you defending this from an ideological standpoint? I'm not shitting on your precious bitcoins, but any 12 year old can see that there are significant differences between the Euro's volatility and Bitcoin's.
The Euro is pretty constant, its value will not fluctuate 200% in a day. Within 24 hours bitcoin has been worth as much as $260 or $50. You are blinding yourself to reality if you think that's the same as the Euro rising and falling against other fiat currencies. Bitcoin isn't one, I'm not trying to make a 1:1 comparison, but bitcoin is not a savings. Taking money and leaving it in wallets for years is not savings, in a burgeoning young economy *with a finite supply* it's much closer to stuffing a bunch of bills under your mattress.
