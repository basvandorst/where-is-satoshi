I can see that. Honestly with futures trading starting at CME I really expected to see it go up quite a bit. That precursor more than anything influenced my buying at 19k. 
It only become a loss if I sell. Time to forget about it for a year or two and come back and see what it looks like.

In marriages that last, financial decision are made jointly and unanimously. Basically each person has a veto vote.  Debates are generally done to win the others vote. 
Crypto is volatile as fuck. Chances are the rising value along with other market indicators such as the CBOE, CME and TD Ameritrsde pointed to it continuing to go up and were enough to convince nice his wife to vote yes. 
It was for my wife. And being older and having seen missed investment opportunities come and go (Apple etc ) we decided to take a small potion of stock (11%) and give crypto a go.  
What will I do if it goes back up to 19k. That’s the question I find myself considering more than if I should sell now in the dip. That would just be like burning money.

If you recall we were on the verge of CME futures trading starting, the biggest futures exchange in the world so there were valid indicators that the rise would easily continue.

Ha-ha, you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia,” but only slightly less well known is this: “Never go in against a Sicilian or bitcoin, when death and HODL is on the line!”

[ELI5] Can someone explain what benefits doing this brings to either the person running the full node or the bitcoin network?
As a non-miner what would the benefits be here.  Being totally serious here. Just got done reading about the mempool and Segwit, was dismayed that as a non-miner there is nothing I can do to help the pool of unconfirmed transactions. Thanks in advance, I find this fascinating.

Great reply.  Is it possible to use a hardware wallet, say a trezor with a full node you are running?

Bought a little at 2.3k, then a little more at 6k and then a few thousand at 19k. Granted the few thousand was a small percentage of my portfolio it still sucks to see it dip like this. 
But I only lose money if I sell right now.  To me it feels a lot like the housing market. When that bubble burst my new house lost 25-30% of its value. It was still a beautiful house. I still enjoyed it. But if I were to suddenly sell, I’d have been fucked. 
Bitcoin feels a lot like that for me right now.  It’s too bad honestly, with the futures trading I really thought 20k was going to be a distant blip in the past. Will just have to ride it out I guess.

It’s interesting that at the peak the vast majority of posts and comments here were that we would be shooting to the moon.  The dissenting minority saying to sell were either downvoted to oblivion or silent.

This post made me laugh. That’s how I looked when we started the dip after buying some at 19k. My theories proved wrong ... or were they.. Time will tell lol

How about just buying a Dremel and a piece of steel and doing it by hand?

My man! Same boat. We might be brothers. In my case I saw the imminent CME futures launch as a real driver for the price to continue to shoot up. 
So I got the nod. In my case I had bonus stock, 11% had matured.  So I sold it and put the money into bitcoin.   And here we are. 
On one hand it wasn’t like I took money out of savings, I mean the stock was given to me for just doing my job. On the other hand nobody likes seeing an investment go south. 
That said, it’s like the housing market. I only lose money if I sell at this point. My only option is to wait or take a loss.

I bought some at 19k on the eve of two facts: the next day the largest futures exchange in the world was going to start trading and the next day another would begin as well (CME and TD Ameritrade). 
The previous week after CBOE started we saw a large rise from 15-20k. I expected to see similar results. I was wrong in the short term. Time will tell if it was a mistake. 
That said, I believe that the dip we saw was the result of an orchestrated attack by BCH to pump BCH. I don’t fault them, the rise again as it has so many times Just speaks to BTC resiliency.
