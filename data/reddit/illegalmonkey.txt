This is crazy and all but do they even have the man power to review all the potential info they could get or are getting?

I've been getting caught up in the bitcoin hype lately and was really aching to buy some, but afraid to. Reading this thread, and especially this comment here, really hit home to me that it's not really worth buying in at this point, unless you're rich and wanna buy multiple coins. If I made a purchase of $500 in bitcoin and it went up to $20,700 I'd only be making another $500 which doesn't seem worth the trouble. Thanks for the rational comments!

I'm still in the "when you have it" phase. Everything has dropped so much... it's just my kinda luck.
