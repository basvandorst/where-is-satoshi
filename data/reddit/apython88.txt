the interface is taking up far too much space, the text indicating hand strength is excessive and its also floating over avatars. The chips are unreadable (how big is the pot?). Why would all players expose the cards simultaneously? The "M" before the balance is distracting and unless they are playing for "M"s specifically, as opposed to the normal game type, it should not be there. The cards on the table face down, what are these? They are mucked cards? They should go in the muck.

Open review of bitcoin services and wallets, ranked by safety and use. How can we really know that bitaddress.org is safe, bitcoinpaperwallets.com, and sites like this? How do the experts rate blockchain.info? Is mycellium, electrum, or bitcoin-qt the safest option? Are their codes even reviewed? The only way I know of is to google, and the answers are there but they are not as clear as they should be. Infact, I just trust bitcoin code on 'faith', I haven't seen any specific group review. I am sure many are the same who do not have a lot of time and programming knowledge.

As a professional poker player who was forced to move from America to continue to work: this will be huge. I have to jump through so many loopholes to deposit on the site because of the difficulties related to being an American wishing to open bank accounts. Skrill doesn't allow it. Neteller makes it impossible for me. Bitcoin will obviously fix this, but just as big of a deal for me; I will avoid having to pay 3% fees on large withdraws.
For those of you who don't know, pokerstars is by far the largest business in the online poker industry, a multi-billion dollar industry that has been severely hamstringed by excessive regulations that have crippled the market and forced many people to move from America to more free countries to continue to support them.

So, a 51% attack seems to be the biggest Achilles' heel for bitcoin. The largest pools have quite a lot of a percentage of the hashrate. If all it takes is controlling THREE individual people to take out the bitcoin network, what makes it secure? (for example, pool operator(s) of ghash, cex, 50BTC. Are we sure these are not the same person(s)? Is the security of the network depending on the honesty of these 1-3 people? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:04:10
milibits is(are?) hard to use. I have to stop and think before saying the milibit amount, and its just frankly not someting I have used regularly before. Now saying something is 100m is not that foreign. We can always work from the start (satoshis) and move towards an easier, more convenient naming system.
We have to invent our own, new currency system. Why do we need to rely on paper money denominations? Why can't a BTC payment look like BTC: 10m-s for 10m satoshi or use numbers in a new way, like I sent 0.10.001 btc, and why limit numbers to mean numbers, in the last amount 0.10.001 perhaps the last number is a binary code meaning "yes" for sent bitcoin fee. Be creative.

they are forcing a currency exchange rate which is awful (I was charged around 3% of a $3000 cashout). Truepoker accepts bitcoin deposits, and I did deposit with them in Bitcoin, but they do not allow bitcoin cashouts, which is leading to problems for me. POkerstars is also considering implementing a deposit fee, and has so many more users than those other sites combined that its not really relevant.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:04:50

Bitcoin is a currency over its own network:  
Run by peers instead of governments  
Symbiotic instead of parasitic  
Accepting of all users and uses 24/7  
that recognizes no flags and has no requirements

optional, minimal fees  
and brings freedom to markets

it has terrible software, less than .01% of the player pool, and its much less safe. Poker sites are notorious for running away with peoples' funds; although I do actually play on SWC sometimes (once a week for the major tournament), its far more risky to play there than on Pokerstars.

amazing value. Massages become part of the life; as they are amazing and $3-$10 /hour by skilled individuals. Freedom here is much higher than in the States, IMO, as there is not much government intervention into lifestyles. Food is so good, I had no idea that I had never tasted real food until I have come here. The main cities, Bangkok, Phuket, and Chiang Mai, are all extremely diversified, a beautiful beach area with terrible locals, a wild city that never sleeps, and a welcoming and crazy cheap small city, all very accessible to one another. The variety of amazing restaurants is unlike any place I have ever been in the world, and the value is great. They are extremely accomodating to foreigners, their economy is based around it, so if you don't speak a lick of Thai you can get around just fine and communicate with almost everyone you are likely to run into. It is hot though, and the culture is very different, so there are some downsides with that (along with ups as well. If you make a Thai person embarassed publicly, you might get killed, where in the states you might just get a punch in the face, they take "losing face" extremely seriously, but on the other hand, the culture is extremely relaxed, so personal freedom is very high).

just in general the Phuket locals, in tourist areas, are more likely to see foreigners as walking ATMs. The entire taxi system there is run by the local mafia and they behave like thugs.

I agree except that centralization is a problem. How many mining pools does it take to get &gt;50% of the network hashrate? Okay. How many owners are there of those pools? Three tops. That means it only takes three people to substantially hurt BTC or destroy it.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:09:29
yes, its severely crippled. American players were the largest player pool and they are almost entirely removed; as are the French, Italians, and Spanish players, due to banking regulations. This is still a multi-billion dollar industry that bitcoin can save, though.

I think bitcoin is quite likely to fail, although its technically superior, for these reasons. They have the funds to bash bitcoin in the media with convincing stories, and the publicity to spread their toxic. Bad stories will be spread like a wildfire, the benefits, technicalities, and good news will remain unspoken. After bad stories comes shutting down exchanges and regulation, and thats the end of widespread adoption, if they want it to be

its a great wallet for storing small amounts of bitcoin, it has a blockchain explorer, its easy to use, and it is not complicated. It really is the best wallet for total beginners, as it is more like the familiar formats of email, etc, than the overwhelming bitcoin-qt program requiring a huge download. Of course, noone should use blockchain for serious amounts of coins, and they should have a disclaimer on their site about this.

Our donation form will get roughly two million more visitors before the campaign concludes on December 31st — which means adding “Donate with Bitcoin” would reduce income by about $140,000 – a significant amount.

Any action you take, proceed with caution and do your research. A small slip up could cost you a fortune. I recommend researching and practicing how to use bitcoins on a different computer, buying a *small* amount ($20 is enough), and learning how to use it. If he really has bitcoin specific computer hardware, he probably has a large amount of bitcoins and it would behoove you to learn to use bitcoins before digging up his stash.

I would go and buy an off-the grid farm and land wherever I could get for BTC only, install solar panels, raise some organic vegetables/fruits and pasture raised chickens and cows. Could get a pretty sweet setup like this for less than several million dollars, and of course would be able to run a small mining operation, hopefully without having to pay power bills. Where I live you can pay electricity bills with BTC already, so thats not a huge problem. Invest in precious metals, a deep well, and land with the rest, should not be a problem. If btc drops to zero, no problem. If btc thrives,$$

1. earning it, or trading something of value for it like USD or gold
2. It solves the problem of trust in financial transactions. This allows people to move money in ways that were not previously possible; without a bank or physical contact. They have value because they are useful as a way of moving around value ('money'), and they will be released at a fixed rate, cannot be counterfeited, and cannot be manipulated, controlled, or corrupted in any way. This is also a revolutionary feature that distinguishes it from USD or gold. The combined usefulness and scarcity give it a &gt;1:1 value to USD right now for example, even though it is an extremely wild and new ideal. The possibility of BTC influencing the global economy is there, and with each day it survives it is growing more influential and harder to kill. The potential upside is outstanding, and it truly is better money.
3. They are 'cash', you can use them wherever they are accepted, particularly online. If you wish to SELL them, you can use local exchanges or trustworthy online exchanges such as bitstamp or kraken or coinbase. When selling the bitcoins, you give the bitcoin your access to the coins and trust they dont steal them, just the same when you buy. Moving the bits into your own wallet (password protected and backed up, it is extremely safe) is a good idea asap. 
A good way to get started is to buy a small amount, say, $5 from Circle or coinbase or localbitcoins, depending on how much you value privacy, and then move it to a wallet of your own (electrum, or mycelium on your phone, or bread wallet). Spend these funds on a website for something, or donate it, or whatever. Just the simple act of "trying it out" will probably blow your mind and also help you to understand better than reading bits on google.

Change is instantly rejected by most people
It challenges our deepest beliefs and feelings of security (is our government really not looking after our best interests? This thought makes people uncomfortable)
and it is confusing and technically advanced especially for laypeople. People are scared of losing money, much more so than they are motivated to win money, and the primary stories in the media are about bitcoin losses, hacks, and illicit uses.
mostly though, because of lack of knowledge and inexperience

9.3% inflation at this time.  It will eventually stop inflating and the miner rewards will become very low soon,  halving next year. This means quartering, etc, until slowly new coins are all but nonexistent.  Coins are also lost,  by people misusing paper wallets,  not backing up hard drives, dying without proper information for loved ones to redeem their encrypted money,  etc.  Apparently hundreds of thousands are lost by MtGox exchange,  and about a million may be forever lost from Satoshi 's stash.  This comes out of the 21,000,000 Max supply,  never to be replaced.  A thousand years from now, when all new bitcoins are already mined,  millions lost forever,  the real quantity of bitcoins will only decrease slowly.

A $10,000 loss is not negligible for "any decent pro". This would require being able to have ebough of a bankroll to write off a $400nl bankroll without a sweat, taking into account travel etc. .

There's a sale for the trezor wallet; I personally think putting the first $75 towards this, and learning to move around and make wallets with a small amount ~$10, securing electrum, recovering from a seed are all good practices and worthwhile investments. From there, I would buy a set amount of Bitcoin regardless of price, over time. For example; maybe you buy 1 BTC after you practice using BTC, and then continue to buy X£/mo regardless of price. Dollar cost averaging is the term for this and it will help smooth out variance and help with saving.

Download electrum, and go to circle.com. sign up for an account, and use your bank or debit card if available to purchase a test amount of Bitcoin, something small. Send these bits to electrum. Back up your electrum seed,  password protect the wallet, and send the funds to your phone on the Mycelium app. Uninstall mycelium and try to recover the lost wallet. After you have, and you have practiced with the electrum wallet as well, you can use mycelium and electrum quite safely for a moderate amount of Bitcoin. Make sure electrum is password protected and you have a backup of the seed. You should be more comfortable now and can manage a larger amount. If you wish to make a large purchase, order a trezor now and wait for it before going and buying a large amount.

if I have a trezor with funds on it, how can I safely start using a passphrase? I get a big warning about making a new account and losing all my bitcoins when I try this. If I add a passphrase , "all your old accounts will be accessible with an empty passphrase". Does this mean only a new "account" will be effected, the old accounts will remain as is, and if I want a password protected account, I just send the old BTC coins, from the old accounts, to the new one?

"   For example if a player drops-out, or wont validate another players move etc, all of the equity in the pot is paid out via the equity in each players hand (in regards to any streets that are or aren’t revealed)"
That allows for cheating with hands that want to realize their equity and end the hand. Also allows the players out of position to neutralize the positional advantage.

First, congratulations on hitting your goal and saving so much. Second, and more importantly, consider all of your investments including Bitcoin and savings. How much do you have in total? If you have $1m, sit on your btc and enjoy the ride. If you have significantly less and no other investments, you should definitely diversify. BTC is definitely a high risk asset and should make up a fairly small portion of anyone's overall investments. 
Personally I am extremely bullish on bitcoin, and have a reckless ~30% in crypto. I Would recommend for anyone to have some portion of their portfolio in a wide variety of assets, don't put your nest egg entirely in a great investment like bitcoin. Buy some Vanguard index fund shares, US government bonds and some emerging markets stocks (I particularly like Asia and the Middle East).  Buy some gold and silver (I like ~10%). 
Diversify, it actually is really important. The upside of having a larger share of a risky investment is dwarfed by the risk. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:42:52

I sincerely doubt a company who has this much funding has 'no idea' what they are developing. Qualcomm, their major investor, is deep in cutting-edge research for related devices. Perhaps related, or not;
 In November 2014, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf announced at the company’s annual analyst day meeting
 
held in New York City that the company is planning to target the data center market with new server chips based on ARM technology and plans to make them commercially available by the end of 2015.
Qualcomm is a really interesting company. 
I am hoping they are using their cutting-edge wireless technologies research + "involvement in data center markets'' could mean lots of (billions) of devices could be potentially used as nodes or have some sort of relationship to their hardware. Billions of devices could potentially be incentivized to use bitcoin and possibly even cooperate in protecting the blockchain as well.
check out this video by qualcomm about a 'sharing economy platform'
sorry for the ugly link. Imagine, nodes becoming more efficient as they link (as far as I can understand), and then this so called 'sharing' app where the lady needs to sell her extra apples, and a peer nearby wants them..

I have always been interested in good coffee and wine, but never tea. Just green tea bags, occasionally a hot green tea, and some iced tea on summer days. I bought this discover Taiwan sampler of OOlong teas, and my mind was blown. It is a true pleasure experiencing the wide range of flavors in this sample and I really can confidently recommend it to anyone, especially people like me, who had not had any real experience with good tea before. 
I am surprised just how many bags, and how much tea there actually is, for this price. Lots to go through; and each couple of teaspoons lasts for several pots. 
(although I am just putting leaves in a coffee mug and sipping on them, which is amazing!)
I particularly like these (all in the sampler that I bought):
Taiwan 2003 Aged Green Heart Oolong Tea
An aged Oolong dating from 2003, possessing a deep and complex taste of walnut shell and ripe fruit, which evolves with each steep.
Taiwan Oriental Beauty Oolong Tea
The leaves are bitten by leafhoppers before picking, which imbues the tea with a unique taste of citrus and honey.
I am in no way related to or affiliated with this site; just an extremely happy customer. It was nice to pay with bitcoin, and infact I would have went to a competitor if they did not accept BTC, but I am glad they do!

@_date: 2015-10-05 05:49:31
I believe I convinced in part Truepoker to accept bitcoin, and now they do bitcoin deposits and withdraws. Mosr sites do indirectly through Neteller as well.
Poker is indeed strongly influenced by Darwin's law. People who can beat $50 cash games in today's games would destroy the $100,000 buy in games of 2007. The regulation's stop most players from depositing or redepositing, and sites take out a large rake, so the best of the best are able to survive and the rest go broke.
I am concerned I will not be able to play peofesionally for more than a few more years in the current climate, so becoming without income, a degree, or prospects for a career suddenly can be fairly disastrous.

they lost their largest customer base by far, this is not growth. they later gained market share because they were operating in a 'grey area' at best. They are also the only decently run company out there so growth in comparison to other sites is a certain thing; compare the amount of play on Pokerstars (traffic, guarantees) just before the UIGEA to today and you will see a loss, I'm sure.

Wow; a couple of key paragraphs from the articles...
Representatives from the Justice Department and the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children also said the possibility of Bitcoin companies moving offshore would make it harder for U.S. authorities to find and prosecute illegal activity.
Digital currency transactions still represent a very small part of the overall economy, but it's becoming an increasingly popular place for criminals, according to Ernie Allen, President and CEO of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.
"While much of the evidence is still anecdotal, there is consensus that commercial child pornography, sexual exploitation, sex trafficking and other criminal enterprises are increasingly moving to a new unregulated, unbanked digital economy," Allen said in testimony prepared for Monday.
The second panel includes a mix of critics and advocates. Ernie Allen, president and chief executive of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, says the main way law enforcement takes down illicit sites — infiltration — is “expensive, time-consuming and often ineffective.” He notes that the Silk Road is already back up and running. Allen goes so far as to say an anonymous Internet is too dangerous. “You can help us address the core challenge, Internet anonymity,”
The Department of Homeland Security is carefully watching the development of virtual currencies, Brian de Vallance, acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs wrote in a letter to the committee.
Anonymity in cyberspace creates "a unique opportunity for criminal organizations to launder huge sum of money undetected," he wrote.
Criminals have migrated to Tor to hide their identities and use virtual currency to hide their transactions, said Ernie Allen, CEO of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, in prepared testimony submitted to the committee.
Ahead of the hearing, the panel released five of the responses. The Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed whether bitcoin should be treated as a security, and the Department of Homeland Security has adopted an “aggressive posture” to address the “emerging threat and criminal exploitation of virtual currency systems.” The Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has gone the furthest, producing two rules that define how exchanges should handle bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The Bitcoin Foundation protests these rules as too onerous as they force bitcoin exchangers to register state by state as wire services.
This Ernie Allen guy seems like a huge problem. Apparently using bitcoins is the same as abusing children.
Oh, another one:
 “For all of its importance, we simply cannot create an environment in which child exploiters, traffickers and other organized criminals can operate on the Internet with a complete veil of anonymity and no risk of being identified unless they make a mistake.” - Ernie Allen

Thats not any more true than saying USD is used to launder money. There was not an active money laundering scheme at all on the major sites. There are strict requirements for setting up an account, and one account per person, with requirements for being able to deposit, withdrawl, or send money to another player.

Bitcoin is a long-term prospect. Everyone knows it is volatile, but why is that? People with relatively small amounts of money can radically effect the price. If someone dumps $5,000,000 worth of bitcoins (a very small fraction of the total value), it will crash the price. Bitcoins are the future, for now, they are at the mercy of economics.

I agree we definitely need a new form of measuring the coins, and I don't think mBTC etc are viable, or even "bitcents". We need something new. A bitcoin is not a dollar, and should not really be littered with coined phrases meant for the dollars. 
I think there is also the issue with perhaps owning "one full bitcoin" seems like a large financial and psychological struggle, and aquiring a "fraction" of a bitcoin might put some people off. Besides, if they are dropping $100 (a serious investment) and they get "0.6028" bitcoins, thats not going to be very appealing to Joe Mechanic.
I do like re-naming a "full bitcoin" to something like "Alpha coin" or "Teracoin" or "Kilo" coin or whatever, and using micro/mili bitcoins as the standard. We call them Dollars. 100 dollars is the largest bill. We routinely use 1, 5, 10, 20 dollar bills. They are based on the smallest commonly used denominator, bitcoin should be the same.
Not only is bitcoin a relatively new currency, but we are at a turning point in bitcoin history where "1 bitcoin" isn't going to be a commonly used amount. Micro or mili bitcoins are used more often than full coins, so we should be referring to those amounts as our base reference. 1 Full bitcoin needs to be the "luxury" end, closer to the $100 bill.

How much do you know about BTC? There are already a few sites that run BTC. You will probably have to convert them to dollars as they hit the players accounts, unless you do plan on having bitcoin only tables, which likely would get little traffic. One alternative is to do it like Pokerstars does their exchange, you can have your account in euros, pounds, dollars, or tourament dollars. Most tables are run with USD$, but you can exchange in real time as you sit at a table. Bitcoin only tables on a major USD poker site would likely be pretty empty and kind of a 'niche' thing. 
An important consideration is the lack of ability to have documentation on players who are depositing with bitcoins. There will likely be some people who would instantly deposit BTC without providing documents (yay!), but then be in a quandry if those documents are required to play. Either verification pre-deposit is necessary, or scrapping of the documentation requirements. Offering people reload bonuses/deposit bonuses with BTC would be great to stimulate the economy. This is great that more poker sites will accept bitcoins, make sure you do things right. 
Accepting bitcoins is great and I would likely be motivated to move a lot more of my volume to your tables, as would others. 
The poker economy is pretty vulnerable right now, accepting BTC deposits/withdrawls (anyone hear instant withdraw with no fees??) would be huge. HUGE. I currently have to pay $10 + 2.5% of my cashout from my main site. I am forced to make larger cashouts than I would like because of this, just limiting the number of times I have to pay the $10. BTC withdraws/deposits would be incredible.

I am cautiously optimistic about bitcoins legal status. This is just a warning. Bitcoins arent going to be seized right now, but its something people need to realize is a possibility if things turn more bleak in the future. The congressional hearings were vague and overall positive, but that does not mean bitcoins are eternally immune to legal interpretations. This is just meant as a word of caution, because this literally blind sighted poker players; IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. We were operating fine, for years. No information, aaaaand its gone.

Typically, each exchange will show a different value - this is due to the difficulty in exchanging bitcoins for real currency, a process that can require the funds to be transferred through several banks in different countries. Each bank would probably charge a fee for these transactions.

GO blow $1500 on whatever. Enjoy.
Then, buy a new laptop. Doesn't have to be fancy, but get something with at least 8GB ram. Disable internet.  Make an offline armory wallet 
Send a small amount of BTC to the wallet before sending a large transfer. Do it in chunks you feel comfortable with; and an expendable first transfer. Try making an armory wallet on your main computer and transferring 0.01 BTC just for practice right now. Recover it for practice. Get comfortable.
Don't ever use this computer for anything except armory. Back it up with a paper wallet, and put that in a safety deposit box.
Consider how many bitcoins you need to sell, hold, and invest. Consider putting a few bitcoins into the more promising altcoins like peercoin. Buy some gold and silver. 
Don't buy a new car. Don't buy shit. Blow your original investment on whatever, and be responsible with the remainder of your money.
I am a 26 year old who has blown this much money and severely regret it. I really wish I could go back in time, live the same life, and have diversified my investment. I wouldn't be in a financial wreck like now. 
Please change your password, if you do nothing else. Just giving away you had a "!" in it, increases the odds its going to be hacked. People are probably looking through your reddit account to find information about you, and using this to try to steal your wallet. 
Take care, and THINK. STOP AND THINK. Emotions are great at clouding judgments. Reflect on how you spend your money carefully. If used wisely, you can make this money last for the rest of your life.

I have been buying as many bitcoins as I possibly can [afford to lose] since the price was $125 recently. Unfortunately, I am poor. 
I believe in buying as many btc as possible right now. btc is spreading like wildfire, and the price has been pretty flat. The world doesn't know how much BTC are really worth, but I know I have more faith in bitcoins than I do in almost anything else in my life. $200+ per coin is a psychological barrier. This will evaporate when people start denominating bitcoins in mBTC or Satoshis. The future of currency is worth, in my mind, so much more than the current price. Think of it in a more logical way. Its not $200/BTC. Its ($1/0.004675 XBT) That is SO many Satoshis for a measly dollar.

BTC exchanges in China get DDOS'd
Someone panic sells millions of $ in BTC. 
People see price tanking and start to panic sell. 
Someone with a huge amount of BTC steps in and sells everything they have; waits for the panic selling to slow, and re-buys, and makes a killing.
Is this at all feasible?

this is why we need to change the nomenclature so we don't have to deal with "a fraction of a"

Vote Satoshi for 2014, this will be the first year bitcoin *really* impacts the world.

yes I think this would be a huge extra layer of security... you could even just teach your family the password, or write it down in a will or something, and send the paper seperately, like a credit card + pin in seperate mail shipments. I feel like someone being able to just walk in, grab a piece of paper, and have access to every bitcoin is just a bit too easy.

this was the first thing that started happening before governments shut down and stole the money from users poker accounts.

I don't know how to develop the game, but I am willing to pay adequately for the game / website to be developed for me. I understand that without the technical experience to make it myself it is more difficult, but I am happy to pay what is required to get it done, and get it done well. Paying with bitcoins would be a plus.

whats this mean?

Merchants need to offer substantial discounts for bitcoin purchases, incentive for both parties. Variance aside, bitcoins will be worth more tomorrow. Dollars will be worth less. Why should we trade 1:1?

whats a good way to secure the computer, rather than using one that never touches the internet (dont want to buy a new computer). How about reformatting, and wiping somehow?
