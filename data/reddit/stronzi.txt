No one said it can be solved with only printed version.

Regarding Ps I tend to think it's about artistic value. Too many zeroes in them, so they would probably look odd. Anyhow, I've brainstormed this myself for quite a while and didn't stumble on any thing that seemed artifical to me. (Artifical like in A-HA!)

I have strong feeling single "+1" refers to "That's a bitcoin address, not a public key" and "Edit: Address of prize  I don't have original version of this message, but I suspect author might have just called it public key instead of address and then corrected it.

oops, sorry, 24 times more

1) OP said we will be at limit of our abilities.
2) Puzzle they were insuired by took 3 years to solve.

Technically, even 3 words are enough.

How did you save it? Such file is expexted to be around 200 billion terabytes in size.

Well imagine the last step was to do A xor B = C to get key C. Remove xor, let A be key, transfer to new key and there you go.

If I am sure I WANT any clue at this moment, it's about this clue. Is this symbol intentional or just a result of some symbol being not rendered properly(main suspect: dot product, doesn't exist in a lot of fonts)?

You can continue as you did. If you stumble upon old adress, you will probably realize what this +1 -1 stuff meant.

Actually, 257 is there too, and it's not in whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:10:28
Doesn't work this way. You can't see any 3d having 2 exactly same pictures overlayed.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:48:42
Yeah, noticed it later. BTW, another suspicious word I found was "hes" and it turned out to be "he's".
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:35:24
It isn't known if it is solvable with paper version.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:08:23
I checked whitepaper, and while I didn't correct some errors which arrived due to me jsut copy-pasting text and probably didn't replace all non-alphanumerics properly(I did basic things tho), even after lowercasing I got around 1k different words, when there is only around 400 on the image.
Doesn't disprove theory itself tho.

Actually, 198004 = 1980-04, from "1980 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (1980-04)

I think I might have found some sort of sense in it. A few thing that matched up with one and a half hints and seem too special to be coincidence. However I'm struggling to go anywhere further and it might be I just struck a coincidental dead end.

Actually, a rig of 6xGTX1080 should be able to do the brute force of order(when you got 18 words) in less than a day by my estimations.
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:57:10
Hah, 4 hours is nothing, 12 hours a day here.
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:03:55
Well they are not guaranteeing it, but apart from few possible technical problems(like their servers/part of their servers being down) that should usually be the case.
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:14:55
I'm still failing to grasp what led you to the very idea of golden ratio being even present in this puzzle in any form?
(Also failing to grasp what "Lara Croft approach" is, but not that interested in that.)
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:05:21
What is it about infinity?
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:25:20
P=NP problem have no relation to this puzzle whatsoever
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:18:06
Hell, even my ideas that led to dead ends and which I decided were complete failures had close to infinite more basis to them...
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:53:34
Changing order of words isn't the way, because checking all possible combinations of 12 words isn't possible in human lifetime. You are supposed to know the exact order from the picture.
