At the end of the interest free period just balance transfer to another 0% deal. If you just pay the minimum amount per month you'd be paying &lt;$85 per month (1%) to own 1 BTC. If you already have $8000 so you could clear the debt at anytime, then this would be the most sensible way of buying in my opinion. 
If you only have $100 to your name though I agree you absolutely should not do this as you could easily end up in a world of pain.

Yeah I totally agree. If you're lucky enough to have $8000 dollars to invest in crypto though then I think using credit in that way makes sense. 
It absolutely shouldn't be your only $8000 dollars though; you should have emergency fund,  relative job security and arguably other savings and investments before you start looking towards crypto.

Well if you can't trust yourself to keep that money to one side then obviously credit wouldn't be a good idea.
Flip it the other way; if you spent $8000 cash on BTC today, then tomorrow it crashed to $1 and you lost your job, you'd be straight up down $8000. If you bought on 0% credit you'd have $8000 in the bank (earning interest), and a small monthly payment to service the $8000 debt. So you'd have cash there for an emergency and a very manageable debt.
I don't know if it's the same in the US, but here in the UK it's currently very easy with a good credit rating to just keep transferring your debt to new 0% deals. Haven't done the maths but by year 3 you'd probably be earning enough from the interest on the cash to cover the minimum monthly payments on the debt.
But yeah, just worth highlighting again, don't spend more on credit than you have in cash, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
