Fair point. I'm not so sure that it would be detrimental to either case, and I'm much more interested in the change itself rather than what it's called. I know I'll probably be using bits colloquially, whether a consensus is reached or not. Besides, a rose by any other name...

It's not apathetic. I pity them, I feel sorry for them and I hope MtGox is dragged across the coals by every relevant authority. But I don't sympathize with the losers *in this particular situation* because the warnings about MtGox in particular have been loud and constant for a very long time. Anyone who had substantial sums of money that they had no intention of moving out of there have nobody to blame but themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:19:44
The only people still believing in Gox are those that don't have a choice because they are trapped. There are too many of them to ignore, unfortunately.

It's not as big a deal as it seemed, but it had to be made into a big deal to make people take notice, before it became a big deal. It's happened before but this time the world was watching and I think the reaction, although a little over the top, actually shows what the bitcoin community is capable of and what it means when it says 'decentralization is extremely important to us'.

Everything reliable is Linux based these days. Android, obviously already used by *millions*. Many governments and militaries (especially US) and banks and corporations (Google) also prefer Linux because it is just flat out safer. It's not difficult to use, there are very accessible GUI's available. Basically, in this world of constant threats it's becoming manifestly true that Linux provides better security. And it's free for fuck's sake! It's so glaringly obvious that we need to steer the wider public towards open source and thanks to Google, and to a lesser extent bitcoin, it's looking more attainable all the time.

A paid shill would be very active on for the express purpose of building a persona befitting the job. These fuckers have really well constructed identities, they spend a long time building trust and reputations as seemingly innocuous contributors in the hopes of masking their subversion techniques. It's like if you ever saw the show "to catch a predator"; they'd set up these chat rooms where the weirdo thinks he's talking to a 13 year old girl but it's some middle aged operative *pretending* to be a 13 year old girl, and their behavior and style is so indistinguishable that they almost outweirdo the weirdo. You have to wonder what kind of person the operative is to be able to do something like that **or** what kind of training they must have had. 
Well this is even deeper than that because rather than build trust over an hour in a chatroom they are spending months and sometimes years pretending to be something they are not, and they do it with adept precision and skill. This happens in every forum and on every user contributed site on the internet, not just the alternative interests and darkweb. Gaming forums, Educational forums, anywhere.
I remember when I was in school and the internet was just becoming more widespread and there was the common joke - at least we treated it as a joke, I'm sure our parents and teachers definitely thought of it as more of a warning - that when hanging out in chatrooms and PMing or it's getting more risque it's almost certain that you're talking to some fat naked old creeper.
Similarly, nowadays you absolutely have to assume, whatever the conversation, if it's held publicly - even private conversations are not immune - that there is at least one or two, likely more, paid and trained operatives present to subvert and manipulate the conversation.
Of course there's the psychopaths with way too much time on their hands who just like to troll and do it for free, but they probably became like that because they were unwittingly manipulated by the paid ops in some prior interaction. Either way there is no difference because they all use similar techniques to derail, only with varying degrees of refinement and subtlety.

The dogecoin community is providing a strong challenge to bitcoin. The dogecoin currency is absolutely no contest, and to believe otherwise is naivity in the extreme.
We are not competing cheersquads or comparing "team spirit"; we're trying to spread the practical implimentation of an idea. Bitcoin, the protocol, is that idea. The currency is a single application of a system of consent and ownership that is far superior to anything before it. All competitors are simply imitators and only serve to dilute the perceived influence of the network.

I think it makes more sense than that. Bitcoin is an uncomfortable word, it just sounds and feels...odd, particularly in conversation. It's perfect as a pronoun: Bitcoin; the technology; the *thing*.
It seems intuitive that a product called Bitcoin would be comprised of "bits".
Also, I like the idea of representing a bit at 100 satoshis, it adds a little poetic flair.

Nah. Takes a while to get from the hearing about it stage to the curiosity stage for most people. Many who have heard of it don't trust it because they don't know enough about it. That will change. There is a huge difference between having heard of something and understanding what it is. A lot of people (nowhere even close to *everyone*) have heard of bitcoin, but very few understand it. The great thing is: they don't have to. Bitcoin will thrive without them and to be honest things are moving incredibly faster than anybody expected them to even just a year ago. I thought it would be at least another couple of years underground. Never ever expected the level of hype we've seen.

It's because people don't do a simple search first. The same thing happens in every single forum that has a constant intake of new members. No matter the topic. The old users get tired of the repetitive questions and constant hand holding. There are 100,000 people subbed here and they didn't all ask "How do I mine BitCoin?" or "Why is the price falling?" as soon as they arrived. Most people took the time to do thorough research and develop an understanding of the subject before becoming active members.

I would really like to see the idea of Satoshi Forest taken national. I'm not a US citizen, nor do I live in the US, but I have witnessed the state of homelessness in America. I was quite disturbed with what I saw. I lived in Mexico for quite a long time and I never saw anything there that came close to what I've seen in the United States. It was particularly frightening in California, but I imagine it is much the same all over. San Francisco and San Diego are two places that I could see the Forest really take root. It would be amazing to see a whole network of SeansOutpost style homeless assistance, bitcoin powered co-ops.

Definitely not fear on behalf of dogecoin. We've cohabited with litecoin and the gang for long enough to know there is room for the little trinket currencies to not bother the bitcoin market. Everything that happens in alt coins depends entirely on what happens in bitcoin, and there was a good [post]( earlier (edit: credit to about the lack of a threat altcoins really pose.

I'd say it's perfectly reasonable, and handy, to have a small 'carry around' amount on a portable device. How else are you going to pay for your dinner? I keep a small amount on the same phone that I use for everything else, just never enough that if I lost it I'd be too concerned by the loss.

Unfortunately for this, much like with the usd value of bitcoin, we are at the mercy of all the localised exchanges. They need to decide the change is worth implementing, then the rest of us can push on. The problem is they don't have the capacity, or will, to work together as a coherent network.

Just hang tight to it for now. The economy is growing all the time. Enjoy the ride. If you want to spend some, please do so, and you can always replace what you spend. But importantly, take some time to learn about the reasons why people *are* using it. And don't panic if the value drops, it tends to do that sometimes. As long as you pay more attention to the growing economy than the growing price, you'll be stress free.

Even many hardcore believers didn't spend a cent until they were well versed in all things bitcoin (including developing a tehnical understanding). It's a shame that you are in this position, really, it is. But it didn't happen because you came to this subreddit. If anything you seem to have missed some important messages; ie. 'Don't put in more than you can afford to lose' etc etc. I'm in a shitty position after the last year as well, but I can tolerate these doldrums because I didn't put any money into bitcoin until I felt like a damn near expert on a bunch of topics I previously knew nothing about (not saying I became an expert, it just felt like that after several weeks of constant reading). I got into bitcoin because I learned about it, gradually understood it, and eventually came to believe in its potential; I didn't come chasing an easy investment. It frankly annoys me to read about so many who did only come for an easy ride, and I'd suggest that they are even more culpable than the hypers (who're by no means blameless) for the fact it's been sinking for almost 12 months.

They're not in defense of drug trafficking. They are in defense of their human right to use drugs, if they desire, in a safer environment.

Those are sentiments coming from different places. People have been saying Mt Gox sucks (The song [Blame it on Mt Gox]( is almost a year old!) for as long as I can remember.

If the defense can live up to everything DPR spoke of when he was active, this will be one of the most socially significant trials of our lifetimes. They have an opportunity to flip it around and put the entire US government on trial for its misappropriation of the constitution. Not only in how they carried themselves in this investigation, but it could shine a (very public) light on what they have become in their pursuit of unconditional power. They've inadvertently put freedom of speech, personal choice, digital privacy and individual liberty up for discussion, and the defense need to run with it at a sprint. That's what this trial has to become about. I honestly wish the defense all the best, I hope they can take this opportunity to do all those who oppose and fear the growing use of oppressive tactics by the US government a great courtesy in the coming months.
This trial needs to be about what choices an individual has and what power a government has to hinder those choices. Not to mention SR is still open and busier than ever, and OpenBazaar could end up being beyond their control and on a much larger scale, so they have achieved nothing in prosecuting Ross.
This is the culmination of DPR's entire driving force, and it's about to be held high in the court of the law as well as the court of public opinion. Whether it's him in the defendants' seat or not, this defense can take us a long way towards making the social changes DPR spoke of come to fruition.

I'm not concerned about the swayability of the market. It's the people in positions to know better offhandedly dismissing bitcoin that might see something like that and start to give it a second look. I don't care if they buy in, as long as they can come to some kind of recognition of the benefits of bitcoin and realise it doesn't need to be blocked/stopped/destroyed/whatever.
Whether or not it's an easy statement to make it is still quite explicitly supportive of a new technology in the eyes of doubtful collaborators and competitors alike.

Last April they single-handedly caused the gigantic panic that drove the crash, when their server crapped itself under a heavy load and ddos. Everybody said it was the end for them and they had to go. That was when bitstamp, who were just a new kid on the block and still very small, became much more prominent. So, many people did leave Gox at the time. But somehow as things settled over the Summer everyone forgot how much a disaster MtGox was, prominent people vouched for them despite their having numerous continuing issues. Then they hit $1000 first and everyone went blind and stupidity ensued and here we are.

Do you mean Tijuana? Or other large border towns? Yeah it's bad up north, but that it partly due to overflow from the States, deportees and Guatemalans trying to get across. It's quite prevalent in DF as well, I guess. I lived in the south but traveled all over. Where I was it was obvious as soon as you get out of the city center that everybody was dirt poor, but I guess they mostly appeared to have a place to go at least. But yeah, poor people are a somewhat prominent feature in Mexico.
As for the States; I just remember walking around in the Tenderloin in SF and being completely stunned by the homeless people filling up the sidewalks block after block. I also noticed, and spent some time with, a lot of young vagabond types who gravitated toward San Diego. It seemed like a place they can go to find comfort and company.

It's false and misleading to say that the "majority" of bitcoin activity is of an untoward nature. The ratio and scale of illicit activities in the bitcoin ecosystem are dwarfed by their legacy finance parallel. I believe it was recently ~~determined~~estimated that somewhere under 0.5% of total bitcoin transactions contribute to illicit undertakings. 
As for those trading it as a commodity, that is basically a symptom of the making of an infant market. I mean, even mature markets have their share of speculation. Not really an issue while we are still in the very early process of price finding and it's not unreasonable to consider that we are still several orders of magnitude from reaching anything resembling equilibrium.
It's like a pre-IPO before a company goes public, only it's always been public, and everybody can take part and is privy to the price finding that is usually resolved before going public.

I have to admit, I'm struggling to grasp exactly what yours is.
I remember the time you are referring to previously, and there actually was an influx of FUD posts spreading false rumours, and it wasn't only here, twitter and bitcointalk were melting down with stupidity as well (I can recall one post suggesting that Satoshi had been arrested in China - as an example of how ridiculous it got), The thing is, I just really don't see the problem with what you see here today? Why does it make you so uncomfortable that people are happily discussing positive things? I would assert that it is a fantastic thing to see people appear unperturbed in the face of a clearly irrational price drop. If there was a rational reason for the drop, don't you think it would be prominently displayed at the top of the front page?
The most important thing to do when you read any post is ask yourself 'what does this person stand to gain by saying this?' You'll find that positive news gains prominence because the overwhelming majority here want to see bitcoin succeed (sometimes - not very often - positive posts can be attributed to people wanting to get a good selling price, but to anyone paying attention those are usually quite transparent) It's the negative posts that require the most scrutiny, because the reasons for wanting to push the price down are usually more sinister, but for the most part it's people who sold at a bad time and are now praying for a lower entry.
tl;dr Use some common sense in discerning people motives.

I'm sorry, but that's not how it happened at all. As I remember it, bitcoiners started to spread their tipping to other subs and were told to get lost by most of reddit. Many other people saw it as an annoyance. That's why bitcoin tipping was toned down.
That's what really gets to me, you guys go on these 'tip raids' and believe that it endears you to all of reddit. The truth is most of them though it was fake, intended to make fun of bitcoin; when they realized it was (sort of) real they enjoyed the novelty. Soon you'll see, people will start getting pretty pissed off about it. I really hope you keep doing it, because you'll start to see a lot more negative reactions from outside than what you've seen from us. When in the history of internet forums have people ever found swarming endearing? People will soon be equating a dogecoin campaign with being invaded by 4chan! You'll see. At first I thought your guys behavior was bad for all cryptos, but now I realize it's only creates a bad image for altcoins. So, by all means, keep up the good work.

Personal anecdote time:
Around March 2013 btc-e changed their login setup so that instead of logging in with your username you needed to use the email address you had used to initially sign up. I had signed up who knows how long before that and had absolutely no idea what email address I had used when signing up so I was unable to access my account. I spent the next month mired in an intermittent back and forth, brimming with btc-e's famous brevity, trying to regain access to my account. After getting nowhere, as a number of their "replies" to my beseeching queries were simply to list IP logs (I had logged in via VPN on a few occasions, which didn't help my cause) it seemed I was getting the run around and I eventually gave up asking. I was unhappy, but knew it was early days, new tech, bla bla bla, thems the breaks. The account contained only a couple hundred litecoins, which by then I'd definitely had my fill of playing around with, and were at the time worth only a couple hundred bucks, so I reluctantly cut my loss and moved on.
Fast forward **15 months**, to just a few weeks ago, and I thought *you know what, cointiki? Yeah maybe a lot of time has passed, but; the space is getting more serious and legitimate all the time; those litecoins are worth like 10x more than they were back then; and; btc-e are still freakin' active - and still big. Why not give this another shot?* So I got on the support page and gave it my best spiel, trying as hard as I could to avoid any words or concepts that could be lost in translation. Well it was like the crypto-clouds finally broke for the first time in months and I'm sure I could hear ZhouTonged singing songs of Satoshi in the sky, because it was a much more amiable, almost loquacious, exchange this time around and after several emails over a couple of weeks they finally asked me if I could prove that I was the owner of the addresses that I'd used to deposit bitcoin to the site. Several hours of blockchain scouring, wallet resurrections and a couple of wrong guesses later I finally got a hit and we were able to establish that I was indeed the owner of the account that I'd been so desperate to access!
When they gave over the email address I cheered and pumped my fists like it was a new ATH. I had expected so little, and was much more than pleasantly surprised by the result. I felt great; not only had I been successful in communicating with people over the internet, but I'd been given a welcome boost to my faith in all things bitcoin (my faith in bitcoin is forever but it's been an onerous 6 months, you know). And amazingly, the coins were there! Within minutes I no longer owned any litecoin and was slightly better bitcoin. Incidentally, I made it just in time for LTC to go kaput, phew.
So that's my story of how a 'shady' exchange for whom I had lost all trust and had several times publicly spoken ill of was able to regain my trust and give me every reason to believe that we, as a community, are absolutely moving in the right direction.
In hindsight, I'm happy that I had such a difficult time regaining access, and that they required me to actually prove ownership (blockchain FTW).
TL:DR btc-e have improved their support system in the last 15 months.

@_date: 2014-06-29 17:20:37
That could be the average, certainly, but it's very hard to believe that **nobody** would've bid higher. It seems likely that most coins might have gone for ~600 range; while it's not unfathomable that some ambitious deep pockets might have thrown caution to the wind and lay down the big dough. The question then becomes which matters most, highest winning bid or average winning bid?
And then again it's entirely possible we commoners are told neither and spend the next month guessing based on whale activity.

It should be irrelevent unless he (anyone) explicitly directs the mob to a certain user or comment. Determining that the open directive to 'downvote the trolls' is a violation is also saying the people targeted (downvoted) are, in fact, trolls. In which case downvotes were deserved. I would hope that common sense prevails.

It's because the only reason 99% of altcoins that gain any traction do so because people see it as a chance to be among the first in on a winner after seeing what a windfall it was for the earliest adopters of bitcoin. They're blinded by hype and greed and in my opinion they need to take a little break from the forums for a while. Not to mention that the majority of the altcoin market is just guys looking to flip asap, and those are the guys who are **always** first in, right behind the scammy creators.

Who cares though? If you can't handle that nonsense don't mod. It's exactly the same in every so-called "community" and subreddit all over this bloody website! Individuals don't make the whole. 
What you should be doing, as mods, is discerning the difference between dissent and "suppression". Figuring out what is constructive and what is destructive (this cross modding business is something I'd consider destructive, if not exactly relevant enough to mean much). People will always be telling you what they think belongs in which category, but ultimately you need to be able to tell the difference, and act accordingly. 
Downvoting is not constructive, I agree, but that is a symptom of the forum, not the subject matter.

I like bitcoin for a number of idealogical reasons (not a libertarian btw) because I'm disillusioned with the current establishment. (if I was going to call myself anything it'd be a socialist (meaning I believe that a government is supposed to take care of its people - which seems exceedingly rare in the world today)). I say all that to illustrate that I'm not just here to get rich, I genuinely want to live in a better world, and I see bitcoin as a tool to that end.
But at the moment I don't really see that it needs to be a whole lot more than an unlikely risk. From my first steps in here I've always thought that this would be a journey over years. I'm frankly blown away by the state of things as they are now and never expected to see the progress we've had since I began. I don't mind if bitcoin stays out of the mainstream, in fact, much like Satoshi way back when, I'd prefer it for a while longer. So even though things aren't going gangbusters at the moment it doesn't mean that all is lost. In fact, until a lot of people started to *actually* get rich, nobody really saw it as such. Sure now it's pretty prolific, but that doesn't mean the experiment is over, just because a few people got greedy.
Merchants need to support it ideologically, they need to offer discounts, they need to continue to accept it even when they're making no sales, because this is a long, long, long term experiment. If people lose patience and give up on it that's fine as well, because it will still be here later for them to pick back up when they feel like giving it another chance.
I still believe that bitcoin has a better shot at contributing to stability and balance in the world than the current economic modus operandi. And that's why I'll keep supporting it.

People are spending less time here **because of the trolls**. Not because they have a point, but because they are incessant.
You may have the right intentions in your current actions, but, if you think you are acting in the interest of maintaining civility, you are choosing the wrong side.
Nobody is shooting down newcomers who come in here with a civil demeanor and asking genuine questions. People who come in here telling us everything that's wrong with bitcoin, on the other hand, are either *clearly* only here to stir up trouble or are unwilling to defend their position without resorting to the defense of the troll brigade. The high and rapid upvotes of trollish comments is clearly an indicator that they are actively derailing the conversation by linking to here, which is their sole prerogative. It may not be a conspiracy, or even organised, but it is a collective action that flows directly from that vitriolic sub.

I used "suppression" in quotes because it was your word. I also think that calling it a cult is just a cheap attack, like I said it is exactly the same in every message board all over the internet targeted to specific interests. There are trolls and there are those who believe they are protecting their territory. It's not cultism, it's more like nationalism.
Also, I guess I don't spend enough time here anymore because I just don't see a lot of support for the people refuting stats and refusing to talk to those that disagree (who aren't obvious trolls). But like I said who cares if they do? No individual here represents the whole.
Now all of the recent infighting is what's really getting to me, but I don't think that has much to do with dissent, and a hell of a lot more to do with egos. So your last point is pretty much true; except we don't even need the help of to impede ourselves.

It seems to me that the prevailing trend is up, but it is being hindered by a large scale effort to cause a crash.

They can have as many as they want. The longer they sit on them the more valuable the rest of our coins get. They either immediately or eventually put the coins back into the economy (maybe they'll hold them and one day they'll implement a huge dump that might temporarily crash the market, which would be ridiculous since a lot of people, including them, could lose millions, but at any rate bitcoin will survive regardless) or they hold them forever. Whatever, their acceptance only adds to bitcoins validation and, you know what they say: keep your friends close...

How long have you been watching and how much research have you done into the subject that leads you to your conclusion of "serious doubt"? The fact of the matter is that if you really want to be involved in bitcoin you have to basically ignore the market and take the time to figure out why people might actually *want* to own bitcoin. The sooner you decide to jump in the better, but **ONLY IF** you understand and genuinely believe in what you are jumping into.

The ATM operator doesn't have the bitcoins before the purchase. It is linked to MtGox and the purchase is made as a standard exchange trade. The operator doesn't even need to know what bitcoin is.

It's disconcerting, though something we are getting quite used to here, that you intend to write about bitcoin knowing little to nothing about it. For many of us here it took weeks of absorptive reading, study and discussion to gain a solid enough understanding of the nature of bitcoin that we were confident enough to speak out, let alone critique it.
All I'm saying is; between the cryptography, the ideology and the economy the rabbit hole is deep, you won't figure it all out in a couple of hours of reading.

When people keep their money in a bank account we don't think of them as 'hoarders'. The most important thing to remember is that bitcoin is *designed* to increase in value. It might seem now that a select few will be left holding all the cards (coins), but their wealth would be made instantly redundant if it wasn't actively shared. Everybody will have the chance to "see" bitcoins, the question is; how many of them will ever get the chance to see a WHOLE bitcoin?
As for the price fluctuations, as the value rapidly [increases to more extreme heights]( the speculators will get shaken off because the troughs will be fewer and further between, thus reducing the propensity to "sell ~~low~~high/buy low" because the speculators will either regularly lose too much between the narrow peaks or they'll finally realise that bitcoin is capable of doing **unbelievable things**!

We also shouldn't overestimate their capabilities in an increasingly open and digital world. Remember that most of the elite are technology illiterate dinosaurs. Historically their power comes almost entirely from controlling the flow of information, but we live in a world of instant access and the dam has finally broken. Sure they have had many instances of success in controlling technological developments, but the eyes and the ears of the public are open like never before and they are running out of shadows in which to do business.
I mean, whatever they try to do, bitcoin will continue to roll on. Pandora's box is wide open, and it can't be closed. If bitcoin has to return to the shadows it won't be for long, because they're our shadows now. It's the elite with nowhere to hide.

But my advice is **read everything you can**!

We just have to hope that cooler heads will prevail. With all the new "investment" money coming in it seems likely that there may be a shake off of those that are less informed or commited.

Well, yeah, we've already seen that slippage. But there is an important distinction to make with regard to bitcoins' divisibility. Nobody will ever really be 'priced out' and there will always be room for everyone. So no, the poor won't get richer compared to the current wealthy elite (which was my initial lament) but they do have an opportunity for somewhat more wealth in bitcoin than they could ever hope to have in fiat. Unfortunately, the longer they delay the less impact that will have on their station.

Wallets are not a big deal. I use Electrum, and it is absolutely simple. Security is dependent on the user (as in protect yourself from malware) but all you ever really need to remember is a 12 word 'seed'. You can write it down anywhere and that's all you'll ever need to access your coins. But always keep the seed offline/encrypted. Electrum also proxies the blockchain from a server so you don't ever need to sync it.

Dude, you must be some kind of savant to pick everything up that quickly!
Seriously, one of the greatest things about bitcoin is the vast spectrum of disciplines one can garner as a byproduct of coming to understand it. It offers people an opportunity to learn about elements of how our society functions that until now have been held hostage by controlling interests. People who would have otherwise remained ignorant of such things as economics, politics, personal finance, security, privacy and personal responsibility, have been able to develop a working knowledge of these things and more, solely through an interest in bitcoin. It's the same rabbit hole that has been waiting for us to peer through for a hundred years and finally people are willingly going deeper and deeper. It's a learning process the likes of which we've never known outside of our current and outdated education systems.
Edit: Just on your questions of usability; we are still in the very early stages. Consider yourself an early adopter, even now. Another point is, how much do people really know about the current banking system? How does eftpos systems work? I don't know and I use it everyday!

Yes! As the value rises we will begin to break the whole down into something akin to decimal denominations. 1/10 of a bitcoin is already worth 6 x $1! That's how we'll all be doing it eventually. Imagine a whole coin became worth $1000, but what you want to buy only costs $1, you would need 0.001 bitcoins (1 mBTC or 'a millibit'). There is a minor issue with exchange and transaction fees, but for the point of the story it is absolutely possible to obtain 0.001 BTC.

This is exactly what happened with MtGox in April and was happening weekly for several months before. We were calling it The Sunday Dip or something like that iirc. It was pure manipulation. They tried it again several times since the big spillover in April but the market reacted much more rationally and in recent months most whale action, especially huge market sells, have been virtually ignored. 
With so many new people entering the market recently I would expect the manipulators to try some of their old tricks, and we can only hope we have a more robust market to take the pressure this time.
Even people who were not around in April should be aware that we are entering a period of genuine growth. Just them being here mere months after a huge panic and bust is a sure sign of a more confident market. Back then we didn't know. We thought the ride could end anytime. Clearly, whether it moves up or down, this ride isn't going to end any time soon.

The value rising is an indication and promotion of adoption. More money involved means more motivation to innovate. No matter what, one side is always going to be playing catch-up, whether it's the value or the adoption. I think higher value promotes adoption.

People *are* hearing about bitcoin in the media. More and more everyday! The tone is becoming increasingly positive as the writers of the articles finally take the time to understand what they are writing about.
It's odd to me that you can turn higher value, which is always either following or leading further adoption, into a negative thing.

Businesses need to realise that making the move to accept Bitcoin will require extraordinary patience. Bitcoin has a long way to go before it is settled, so people won't be spending large amounts for some time. An interested business would be quite naive to assume accepting bitcoin is going to immediately increase revenue. But if they took the time to understand what is happening here, they would realise that accepting Bitcoin today would put them at the front of the field in two or three years. Any business that isn't thinking that far ahead is just inept in my book.

We know volatility is only good for market makers. We also know the bitcoin market makers abilities pale in comparison to those in legacy finance. When real money arrives in the bitcoin space we can expect some kind of price discovery equilibrium. It's not a 'fatal flaw' of bitcoin that we are in a period of long term price discovery. It will take years to find but that doesn't mean people are not going to continue to use it as a currency - as can be seen even now in so many recent posts of cars and honey and music and on and on.

You are in a subreddit for people who are interested in the potential of bitcoin as an alternative to the violent and repressive nature of neo-conservative economics. That's where my bias lies, and I wouldn't dream of hiding it. Krugman is a corporatist and statist. I don't want people like him interfering in my way of life. So when he comes along attempting to discredit what I have put my energy and effort behind because he either does not understand, or understands and is being willfully digressive, then I feel like something needs to be said. Because there are alternatives to the current nature of economics, and they deserve to be taken seriously.

There's perhaps just a hint of reverence in Chilton's voice when he talks about bitcoin. Of course it's hard to tell through the suppressed fear. He definitely understands how very real the potential of bitcoin is and he knows his only chance to control it is to make sure more people don't reach that same understanding. That said, his warnings serve a useful purpose in that people *should* enter this sphere with caution. Educating oneself about bitcoin and the economics involved is a grand undertaking and one that should not be taken lightly.

It seems to me that your concern in centered around the idea that the value will continue to rise relative to the dollar. What happens if we reach a point, far in the future, where it's no longer bitcoin rising against the dollar, but instead the dollar falling against bitcoin? Where do you draw the distinction and which is the more stable currency beyond that point? People are getting into bitcoin because they see the potential to change the economic paradigm. If you disagree, or believe the current system to be superior, then, by all means, stay away. Perhaps the increasingly defensive nature of bitcoins detractors suggests that they aren't quite as confident in their model as they would like to believe?
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:14:51
I agree with you. And I also believe that we should call uBTC 'bits'. It's easy to tell someone "Yes, well you see, a **bit**coin is a digital string containing 1 million 'bits', and those 'bits' are the units that compose our currency".

Well, I'd be happier if we were genuinely investigating alternatives to the entire economic model as a whole. I consider resources a basic human right. The problem, as you point out, is that the established culture of greed is never going to let that happen.
Bitcoins are limited, so there may not be the desire to endlessly acquire and a more thoughtful consideration of how ones wealth is expended lest it become exhausted. Basically, nobody can manipulate the bitcoin system in their favor. Sure they can be rich, but they will have to work hard to stay rich. If they attempt to be corrupt they'll be quickly recognized as such and renounced by the community at large.

You guys are ridiculous. Who cares what anything is priced in? Nobody ever said we want things priced in bitcoin. We are clearly many years away from that even being a possibility.
I can't believe the way people talk down bitcoin because it doesn't provide immediate deliverance. It seems the most common detraction is that it doesn't do now what it has the potential to do in the future.
Go away and check back in a few years then we'll see what's working and what's not.

I'm telling you that it takes a distinct lack of understanding of what bitcoin actually is to not see the potential it has. Just because it hasn't yet reached that potential is not a sign of failure. A tiny economy is slowly growing around an entirely new technology. If you want immediate results I would recommend you go away and check back in in a few years when bitcoin might have reached a level of usability upon which you can respect it.

The all or nothing mentality is quite bold at this point(edit: I may have misread your meaning of 'all or nothing'), I'm near enough to that but not bothered since I basically live a 'nothing to lose' lifestyle anyway. 
The point I think needs to be made though is that rather than thinking in terms of 'cashing out at the end' we should be reflecting on the possibility that eventually we may not need, or want, to ever cash out.
One day, sooner than later, we should put aside the notion that our bitcoins only have value relative to the dollar.. When we are counting dollars against millibits, and going shopping with whole coins begins to feel something like buying milk with a $100 note will it even be worth it to switch them out for any local currency, simply because it's familiar?

This is one point I've recently found myself lamenting. Bitcoin initially excited me because I thought it could elevate the common man and take long strides in reducing the class divide. But the window is closing for the general public to capitalize on what will be a world changing event; The establishment is coming, and when they arrive bitcoin becomes another tool of the wealthy. 
Granted it is far less susceptible to corruption. 
The thing that shakes me the most, however, is that the common man has nobody to blame but himself for not understanding the incredible opportunity in front of him. The number one enemy of the ~~poor~~middle class has always been indifference. It seems, unfortunately, nothing has changed in that regard.
edit: changed poor to middle class. Who, from the perspective of the elites we're trying to topple, are barely any different.

Congrats on the work that you've done, not only in sverige, but also your work with TPB and wikileaks. Are you still involved with the SPP? I try to follow Swedish politics but I get pretty fed up with the undercurrent of racism and xenophobia, seemingly instigated by the SD, but certainly carried by many of Sweden's average citizens. I feel like Sweden might be taking some backward steps when it comes to progressive policies, especially immigration (not to mention privacy and freedom of information). So many Swedes I speak to have a bizarre animosity toward foreigners, much moreso than anywhere else I've been (Australia and USA included). Sorry to go so far off topic, but I was just wondering if you were still involved in politics and your thoughts on something that has been bothering me more and more since moving to Europe.

You want legitimate answers? Your first stop is to type "should I buy" into the reddit search to the right. Read every post that comes up. Then read as many 'what is bitcoin' and 'how to's' as you can find. After that read some news posts, even negative ones, including the comments sections. From news posts move on to learning about wallets. When you finally think you know what bitcoin is figure out how to buy one (ie. exchanges or localbitcoins.com). Now, buy one! Make sure you know how to move it around (become aware of "change" wallets and what they do!). Most importantly, know how to balance your limits against the potential. Buy in, understand, hold, use, believe, have fun!

I suppose nature will be around long after humans too, but that doesn't mean it can/should take the sustained pounding we're giving it.
Bitcoin itself isn't fragile, plenty of us here know that. It's the ecosystem coming up around it that needs nurturing. The aim of the game is to give people something to believe in, something they can trust. If we, as believers already, can't trust the biggest player to take enough care, it doesn't bode well for anyone watching from the sidelines, much less those that don't even know we exist.
Bitcoin will be around forever. What matters is who'll be around to enjoy it.

Even if the price were to crash, it would undoubtedly be only temporary. There are legions of users waiting to jump in at low, low prices. If you were to stay strong and hold through a crash you would eventually have it back, and then some. But, that's like, my opinion, man.
The best advice is this: Understand what you are putting your money into, and don't do anything until you believe it is the right thing to do. Speculators, even "good" ones, often lose. A lot. Buy and hold, but not until you understand why it is good idea to do so.

Pay attention to the massive innovation around the bitcoin space. Do you really think that the millions of people already involved, especially those on a technical level, are going to close their computers and say 'well, we tried. gg' just because banks won't cooperate? It's already gone too far, they can slow it down, but they can't stop it. If they come out with something similar that they control, people will just see that as a sign that bitcoin actually is a good thing.

It's no different than people having 'unimaginable wealth' today simply because they were born into a certain family or class. The bitcoin 1% might be more benevolent than the current 1%? It's worth it, in my opinion, to find out.
edit for a follow up point: The wealth redistribution in a dominantly bitcoin economy is going to be expeditiously enhanced because even if these people have thousands of coins those coins have very little effect on the voracity of the economy until they are reintroduced at which point they would "trickle down" - to hijack a popular phrase from contemporary economics. 
If they are reintroduced quickly they may cause minor inflation, but it would be quite difficult (and why would anyone ever try?) to spend 100's or 1000's of coins at once, by the time their purchasing power virtually outweighs one's ability to spend.

It is also very important to understand what happens with "change" wallets, and why it is essential to backup your wallet.dat (if using Bitcoin qt) every time you move funds out. It is not enough to know the private key to your main 'savings' public address, because if you move funds out of it the "change" will be put back into a newly generated pub/priv key set, by default. **Backup the whole wallet**.

Also, if my computer were to unrecoverably crash, I could still recover the wallet/s simply by having the pub/priv keys? Or is it also imperative to have a copy of the wallet.dat?

Paper wallets are designed for **STORAGE** only. When you move funds out of one you need to move it all or you risk losing the change! This really needs to be made clearer in *all* paper wallet tutorials and such.

Imagine the demand on localbitcoins if it was the only place to get them. In fact, I would prefer to see more localbitcoins clones pop up to replace the insane dependence on centralized exchanges.

Why wouldn't you just leave the sub and mind your own business then? What do you gain from hanging around here laying the boots in? When things start going well again I hope you stay the fuck away.

Wow, that's exactly the kind of bullshit spin that makes government so damn unappealing.
It doesn't matter that the economy keeps millions in a perpetual state of spend or die, that really equates to; spend *until* you die, at least it's allowed *someone*, somewhere, an opportunity to break free of the cycle. Aren't we fucking lucky!

It's highly likely they will go down further. With MtGox closed for the day a lot of people will want to sell when they ~~close~~open, but those people are numbskulls. I urge you to study Bitcoin with fervour and figure out why those of us that are still here are excited about it (hint: nothing to do with speculation). It might take a long time, months, likely years, but the bitcoin economy will grow. The infrastructure will grow, more merchants will accept it. The growth will be slow, like all of us knew it would be until about two weeks ago when things just became rediculously unsustainable. You shouldn'ty have put your whole life savings into bitcoin, but it's too late now. I suggest you educate yourself and learn why many of us *still* believe in bitcoin.

It's not for me to do your research for you. When I first came here I spent several weeks reading everything I possibly could in an attempt to understand just what it was I had stumbled across. It was months before I became openly involved in discussions, because I didn't want to appear ignorant by talking about a subject I wasn't familiar with. If only more people would show the same respect.

It won't have much chance of realistically competing with bitcoin but I have no doubt it will ride bitcoins coattails right on through the field of fiat. It can't hurt to grab a few and see where they are in a few months. But watch your back because that market is a shit show.
The btc-e trollbox makes it pretty entertaining.

It's difficult not to be dismissive when you say gold has value because "psychology". What could be more subjective than the psychology of humans?

Bitcoin has already made you a rich man and your grandparents are *still* on your case about it not being the real deal? Harsh.

In all seriousness, it's a decision that only you can make for yourself. If you have done substantial research and are finding that you genuinely believe in what Bitcoin is all about then it won't matter when you buy. If you trust yourself to watch the price drop 10 dollars without falling into a panic and trying to sell, buy anytime! Buy in parts as a leverage in case the price dips and you can grab some cheapies, but you might then find each purchase increasingly more expensive than the last.
