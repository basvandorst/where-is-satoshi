No, you can't make currency-based trading transactions through a normal bank account.
Also, completely irrelevant to the conversation. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:03:15
They take a really long time to process deposits to the point you think they've stolen your money so they need to reorganize and become more streamlined. This obviously wont happen over night and the huge influx of new users doesn't help so I don't blame them. 
However, I would like to be able to trade other currencies and until they seem serious about adding cryptos they aren't trying to shill I'd rather have the option even if it means through a somewhat more shady exchange.
After all, this is all gambling and you never gamble with more than you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:28:00
I'm talking about when my bank has confirmed the transfer and the money still isn't available to me for another 5-6 days. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:40:33
nope. I pulled out before the fork into fiat and then bought afterwards during one of the dips.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:17:42
I am awaiting my bitstamp confirmation. Kraken still has .02 of my BTC though. While this isn't that much, I'd still like it back.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:20:20
Kraken has a 3rd field on their login page for 2FA regardless of whether or not you have it enabled. I've tried logging in with and without my 2FA code (even though it should be disabled) after each time I've reset the password and it hasn't made any difference.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:39:05
Do you get "invalid login" or "account temporarily disabled"? Because I'm getting the latter now after all my login attempts. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:59:43
Thanks, I'll see if it helps.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:22:23
idk, I didn't like them in The Social Network.

The lack of transparency as to who runs it, how it actually functions, financial statements, etc. 
This has Bernie Madoff written all over it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:54:22
Just seems like an exit scam waiting to happen.

chain group is a scam
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:42:54
No, the owners wouldn't provide any POC and they wanted 10k minimum basically without answering even basic questions about the model. I'd say it's a scam or at best that Vicki is real but either not very effective or the current owners don't understand how it actually works. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:50:23

So then by the transitive property fiat currencies and cars are also like the internet.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:05:11
Very true. I guess I just though there was some inherent value to bitcoin that I was missing. It seems very likely though that once the market cap gets big enough a lot of countries are going to come together and make their own cryptocurrency that will render BTC a relic.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:49:28
This is a good response. However, what would stop a financial institution from creating their own cryptocurrency instead of using BTC?
Would it be cheaper or easier or something?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:56:25
I assume you are talking about in the past when finger prints weren't a thing, the NSA didn't have near immediate access to your personal life, intersections didn't track your movements through license plate scanners, and you didn't need a computer as a medium to make your exchange. 
If the US pushed for every nation in the UN to institute transaction taxes on cryptocurrencies, and just for the sake of the argument they did, then where would these exchanges jump to in order to avoid the taxes? Also, if you did manage to avoid these hypothetical taxes and an exchange's managerial staff was well hidden enough wouldn't the users just incur the cost of these taxes anyways through the risk and likelihood of an exit-scam?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:11:36
No, it's happening now
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:27:21
Are you kidding? How many small businesses who never pay taxes do you think survive? Even though there are plenty of ways to launder and hide earnings everybody and every business still pays *at least some* taxes. 
If the government saw a huge and increasing hole in the Fed's wallet what do you think would honestly happen? Do you think the federal reserve and the government would take it lying down? The Fed isn't accountable to the people and what you are talking about could only ever effectively occur after marshal law were declared and citizens successfully rebelled against the entire government. Are you willing to escalate the use of crypto to a civil war? Because that's what it's going to take. And if you are willing to, do you think the majority of first world citizens are? And if the citizens are, do you think they are able to conquer the governments of modern society? Governments that can see and hear everything, that can bomb targets remotely, that can shut down the communication grids you utilize at any time? 
This is the enemy you all think you can conquer just because "people's minds our opening" and it's fucking dumb. Do you really think the central banking systems won't have governments employ violent means, if nonviolent means do not prevail, when you fully intend to destroy them? Fat chance. They're going to use everything they've got to fight back if crypto users ever actually do back them into a corner and at that moment we'll see the true value of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:09:52
If bitcoin replaced the dollar as the world's primary currency and what other reserves started using to back their currencies instead of USD.
Obviously, this will occur once it becomes valuable and mainstream enough.
My God I feel like I'm on fb talking to some of you. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:43:19
A government like the US could take measures to make the exchange of your currency very difficult. Say if a system of fines was put into place for large and small businesses that accept cryptocurrencies how would one continue to utilize them if the risk for the businesses with goods/services outweighed their reward and convinced them to not accept the currency?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:55:54
Yes but the vast majority of wealth is in these first world countries which means bitcoin would be forever crippled against a first world competitor just because of the huge rate of increased liquidity compared to the cases you highlighted. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:09:10
Thank you for providing sources. It's currently legal in Russia. When was it banned and for how long? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:31:38
Except a government with trillions in assets.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:26:43
After a functional version of one is actually built.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:18:38
How would one do that if they didn't have access to online services? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:27:08
Then the US and it's allies could impose economic sanctions on said country. 
I think what your missing is that if it truly becomes a global phenomena, which is exactly what you and everybody else seems to be gambling on, then governments across the world will want their cut of this new pie. Look at any industry ever in the past, governments have found a way to tax it all. How is bitcoin different? If they can't tax individuals then they will tax businesses and if businesses make more money using fiat currencies because of the taxes then why would they use crypto? If businesses begin refusing to use crypto then what good would it be to an average consumer?
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:39:17
To your skull
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:20:28
Yes, but gold and paper currencies are backed up by huge governments that have hundreds of billions or trillions in assets and have legislation that promises they will honor the value of these place holder assets. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:03:58
By fining xapo into non-existence. Everyone here with this objection seems to be forgetting that governments can and do shut down businesses. Why would they target people when the organizations that supply the people with goods and services could be shaken down instead? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:09:43
Never gamble with more than you are willing to risk.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:29:23
Because the federal reserve will no longer be able to print money and banks will no longer be able to create currency through debt. Do you not know how central banking works? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:50:17
I don't really think any of these things are comparable though because none of them took away the Federal Reserve's power nor the power of any other central banks let alone all of them. Also, during prohibition, police in general were a lot less effective at what they did. There wasn't finger printing nor license plate scanning intersections. Their enforcement methods were pretty much limited by how many individuals they had. Now they can shut down entire power/communication grids. Times are very different. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:21:54
If you don't have banking access then how would you utilize bitcoin, a currency that requires that you have a smartphone or computer to use?
For questions 2-6, if bitcoin becomes mainstream then there is no reason banks wouldn't adopt it. So how exactly does replacing a fiat currency with crypto prevent any of those situations from occurring? If we look at these past examples and just replace the fiat with crypto would any of these major events have taken place differently?
Fuck no I don't want to use the godvernment's money. I would much rather use crypto for all the benefits it poses. However, in order for a currency to work it needs to be widely accepted and if the godvernment brings the hammer down I don't see how individuals could really stop it.
Yes I am aware of the near 3% transaction fees. What is going to stop banks or governments from charging transaction fees in a bitcoin world?
It is worth a lot if all the main governments unanimously decide it is ok for people to use. 
If they declare war on it and fine businesses for using cryto then it would become relatively worthless. At least from my standpoint. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:03:50
debt is a type of asset. Also, if you look at a lot of first world countries their assets far outweigh their debt.
[Here is the US for reference](
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:48:02
You say that, but I am completely unaware of such an exchange existing, besides I guess LocalBitcoin. 
Every other one I am aware of has you store your BTC on their platform until you extract it. What exchanges are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:30:28
Because you can institute laws that force people to use it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:22:58
Paper currencies are backed up by huge governments that have hundreds of billions or trillions in assets and have legislation that promises they will honor the value of these place holder assets. While this is no solid guarantee it's the closest to a perfect guarantee we have and it is definitely a better guarantee than a cryptocurrency's guarantee which I believe is non-existent.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:05:15
Which government? The US has a lot more assets than it has debt.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:46:30
Yes, but if BigGasCo. or BigGroceryCo. were told, "Hey, if you use Bitcoin we are going to shut down your company." by the Godvernment do you think the average consumer would be able to buy gas or groceries from their local businesses? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:40:34
This is actually really helpful and I think the first well put response I've read so far. However, I don't think you answered my question about financial institutions implementing their own cryptocurrencies. The largest value of a currency comes from it's liquidity. Since financial institutions obviously oversee the most trades they have a huge influence on this liquidity. So why then would they use a current cryptocurrency instead of just making their own and then moving it around a ton to increase its value over any of the current ones in circulation?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:20:02
eh, i've got about $1k in BTC. I'm all for gambling with it, but I just don't see how it could ever live up to the hype. It'd be nice, but we haven't seen any government really try to shut it down yet and I think when that finally happens, which it inevitably will if it grows to your own highlighted expectations, there is going to be a massive deflation in value unlike anything that has occurred as of now.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:15:41
This seems like a good response. I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:29:03
Unless a tax is applied. Also, transaction fees might as well be taxes.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:07:55
except you can't pay for things like gas, groceries, or rent reliably and as needed through the internet. (i.e. the goods and services that make up the majority of spending)
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:30:23
Big banks have a huge distribution network though and media outlets that will immediately side with them. Who's going to trust Bitcoin, made by the haxor 4chin, over BigBankCoin? Granted, a lot of people aren't that stupid but there is definitely more people who are that stupid than who currently use bitcoin. 
If this distribution system is properly leveraged and enough people begin using BigBankCoin instead of Bitcoin the value would soar and Bitcoin might get left in the dust. It would be extremely sad, but what's to stop them? 
We can keep trading bitcoin and using it to pay for goods/services but if businesses have an incentive to shun it then how is it going to be a useful currency for the average person?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:44:16
The value in a network is being able to leverage it for a use. Bitcoin could be used by every person in the world but useful data could not be extrapolated about its users in the same way social network platforms can do.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:26:48
People are already making their own competitive cryptos. The principal is basically the same for all of them, but the people who make them are the people who first hold them before the ICO distribution. Who is the consumer going to trust though? BigBankCoin when they know BigBank and have used them for years or Bitcoin, something they have likely only heard of in passing? BigBank has a huge distribution network that they can instantly leverage. If enough people have it, trade it, use it, then why wouldn't it become instantly more valuable?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:50
They're taking an exponential jump right now. Transaction fees aside though, couldn't a government just institute a transaction tax on the exchanges that operate on their territory?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:05:59
Financial incentive
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:47:31
Facebook and Instagram both have huge value because of the social networks they have created. It is extremely hard to create such a large user base and very expensive to try which is why instead of creating new facebooks every week advertisers utilize the existing services instead. 
Email has networking value as well, but the main value in it comes from data mining which is why it is free. The information you allow access to outweighs the cost of storing it.
Bitcoin does neither of these things so I am unsure why you used them as examples.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:27:19
Yes, they are promises from huge governments that have hundreds of billions or trillions in assets that they will honor the value of these place holder assets. While this isn't a perfect guarantee it is a lot more solid than a crypto's guarantee of value. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:44:09
Fair enough. You're point about a government not doing that is kind of contradictory though. The major selling point of bitcoin seems to be "governments have proven to be untrustworthy so lets use a decentralized currency instead." Governments have shown that they can be trusted to protect their own interests though and the interests of the most powerful people in the world. If these players can't use bitcoin to their advantage wouldn't they just wage a devastating war on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:42:48
If we look at the 2008 recession you referenced, the problem wasn't that USD increased in value, it was that the chunks of housing securities were over valued because they were under analyzed. I fail to see how replacing USD with BTC would have changed that situation. People still would have defaulted on their loans and banks/financial institutions/investors would have still been left holding the same bag (their over valued housing securities).
I am not talking about legal action taken against individual consumers. I am talking about legal action taken against large businesses. If BigGasCo. is going to get fined for engaging in crypto transactions at a greater extent than they profit from it they will stop and then how will consumer A, B, C, ... pay for their gas/groceries/(insert good/service here) in crypto?
Lots of people just tried to topple the Turkish government (which is a fairly regular occurrence) but due to clever strategy and implementation this year was the first time since 1960 that such a coup has failed. If Turkey can prevent this then why wouldn't the US or another first world country with even more resources and power be able to?
If 15%-30% of the economy does care about legality that still leaves  85%-70% that does. Also, even these people need somewhere to buy their groceries and gas legally.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:24:55

@_date: 2017-06-12 18:35:31
If all currency is doomed to eventually fail even with a central governing body that regulates it then how is BTC ever going to succeed with absolutely none of this additional support?

@_date: 2017-06-13 00:19:24
That may be true but if it becomes to difficult to purchase goods with btc then a lot of people will ditch it. 
How would they initially get the btc on the debit card? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:59:44
That's a customer base not a social network. You're comparing apples to oranges. If everybody at gdax suddenly stopped spending bitcoin gdax would be worthless. If everyone on Facebook stopped trading bitcoin Facebook would be unaffected and vice versa.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:27:02
Yes, it has been over half a century and pot is still only legal in a few states. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:11:45
and they have absolutely no risk of an exit scam occurring or the same risk of it occurring as an institution like coinbase, or other exchanges with actual individuals to hold accountable do? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:30:00
So if bitcoin gets big enough do you think the federal reserve and US government would not resort to force if non-violent consequences had no effect on its use? 
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:41:20
It doesn't really matter. Many individuals don't think the transfer of less of a bitcoin is possible. Showing that you can still transfer $1 with BTC with real world numbers helps people to visualize the concept.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:13:46
Only one?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:12:40
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:17:57
How is bitcoin the same as the internet? That's like comparing apples to oranges or saying bitcoin is the same as vacuums because they both use electricity. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:40:12
If it becomes valuable and scarce enough why wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:09:23
By hitting your business with fees when they produce proof you are using said currency. If you're trading baseball cards with your friends then whatever, but what if you need gas or groceries or something else? All the US would have to do would be send an agent to enough of these different stores and have them purchase a good/service in crypto and then blast the business. They do the same thing with liquor stores and carding. 
If the fines were high enough and enough examples were made then a lot of businesses would back off and without large institutions to buy goods/services from then who would want to use crypto instead of fiat?
