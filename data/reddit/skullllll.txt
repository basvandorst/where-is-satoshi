All that seems highly unlikely and merely theoretical at this point then.

This reply makes me think you're trolling.

If you lived in a country that doens't require you to pay taxes on bitcoin trading, would you say day trading is actually tempting?

Not directly related to the OP's question, but should I assume that making transfers between wallets selecting no-fee, isn't advisable? Why?
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:16:33
Copy pasta?
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:41:59
Spend it before the next halving, and dont spend the 1k all in one go, I'd say.
@_date: 2019-11-01 04:23:06
@_date: 2019-11-16 05:33:32
Yeah, but what makes you say that?

This is Us only, right?

They're still being mined, but what miners get for each block solved after each halving will be cut in half. Less offer for the same demand will lead to an increase in price. What will happen in time is that the demand will certainly increase, making the increase even more significant in the long term.
@_date: 2019-11-07 07:04:16
How so?

Yeah, I just went ahead and read their terms of service. Not availble for btc  outside US. Coinbase fucks me up with my small purchases.

Hum, only got the usual Home &amp; Legal &amp; Carrers Link. Will have to check it out later with more time.  Thanks for the tip anyway :)

The next halving will occur in more or less six months from now. It happens every 4 years, and for each halving the amount of coins miners get is cut in half. In theory this means that since there will be less coins in circulation and with demand staying the same/gradually increasing, the price will inevitably go up from that point onwards. 
There will be a few accidents down the road, but the trend will be increased prices. Personally, the only doubt I have is that if it's still possible to make a very confortable amount of many with a relatively small investment. If we invest 100 dollars per month for 4 years, will we get a really good profit? It seems to be that way, but who knows.

Thank you very much for the insight, wasn't aware of this at all.

I'm doing about 100 dollars each time I buy. Is that service good for that?

People already have that attitude towards bankers and nothing happens. What's the difference?

Oh man, you're really good at this.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:03:22
I thought PRO meant that you'd somehow pay for acess it for added features? Much like spotify free vs premium (werid comparison, but you know what I mean). Not sure, I'm based in Portugal, will have to check it out. Should work, since the non PRO works just fine.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:35:45
Ok, that makes sense. But would a no-fee transfer poise any security danger? And is it reasonable to expect more than 5 months for it to clear?
@_date: 2019-11-12 02:43:34
Still trolling? What the fuck dude.
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:27:15
It could be, but with such a small margin the fees would eat the profit.
@_date: 2019-10-29 21:18:25

Problem with Robinhood is that you can't withdraw the bitcoins. Anyway, about day trading: just search this sub for those terms and you'll see what's all about. It doesn't look pretty.
