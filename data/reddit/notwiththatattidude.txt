Yeah man, it's so easy now your Barber and Mom are into it!

So, in the Senate hearing yesterday, they indicated that there is a believed "floor" value because of the computing power it takes to generate 1 BTC. Is this completely ignored when establishing a floor value? 
For example: let's say it takes $10,000 to produce a brand new car. The floor value would be $10,000. Is the same true with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:19:01
Then why does this community walk around as if they know the final destination of Bitcoin? There's real money being thrown into the game, and there's no clear answer that this thing will remain sticky during a downturn. That's a pretty big bet.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:26:45
Thanks for your response! This is essentially the answer I was looking for. 
What happens when we run out of bitcoins to mine? Is the average price equivalent to the computing power and energy it took to produce a single BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:25:05
So that includes the GPU cost, Electricity and more? Could you provide a breakout of the costs to produce a single BTC? I would be greatly appreciative :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:13:24
People shit on it beacuse it's full of risk and uncertainty. Don't be blinded by confirmation bias brah.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:24:28
Have fun paying for your taxes, rent, car payments, credit cards, mortgage and gasoline with Bitcoin. 
Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:11:53
Your arrogance is incredible lol. God forbid someone wants to try and learn about Bitcoin in a community that's all about Bitcoin and I'm greeted with your attitude? Adorable.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:37:36
But that trust becomes violated when you have opportunistic traders that are introduced to the game who manipulate the value however they want; this lures in innocent people who want to believe in this "trust" and ultimately they get burned because it's a zero-sum game. 
How can there be trust if there's no established value from the core community? What happens when a recession hits and Bitcoin can't be redeemed for anything other than centralized currencies? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:32:55
Damn dude, don't take it too personally lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:50:35
It makes you wonder: what are Bitcoin hodlers holding onto? Is it just a rocket headed for the sun? 
I don't think it matters to this community. The sharp and instant gains are appealing enough just to have some. I think it's the ride that people are into, not necessarily the destination.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:35:42
Spoopy. PM me your address and I'll send you some aluminum foil.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:35:14
You have a firm grasp on global economics.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:59:42
Welcome to Bitcoin! Where there's a lot of money and no one knows what's going on, but they sure do talk like it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:18:02
Lol, what? Maybe this sub doesn't understand what Bitcoin is, but the rest of the world needs to understand what the underlying value of Bitcoin is, which requires identifying it as a security or currency. 
The Senate just had a hearing on this last week lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:28:33
Mods should probably step in at some point. It truly taints the image of what cryptocurrency is and who are the typical investors of it. This subreddit is really toxic and somewhat of a circle-jerk. It's hard to appreciate this subreddit at times, where it should be a resource of (at least partially unbiased) education and information.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:25:35
Lmao what? Are you high?
Bonds, stocks, real estate (inflation hedge), Index Funds, etc. All of them are safer and significantly less volatile than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:59:24
Lol, keep your money in Bitcoin buddy. You obviously know what you're doing :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:21:01


Alright boys let's get off the hype train. People in a different thread said that Bitcoin isn't even a currency, so why celebrate e-commerce integration if you guys aren't classifying it as tender?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:18:54
Lol, what? Maybe this sub doesn't understand what Bitcoin is, but the rest of the world needs to understand what the underlying value of Bitcoin is, which requires identifying it as a security or currency.
The Senate just had a hearing on this last week lol
EDIT: Ok, if you guys would like to use the "False Dilemma", then stop praying that more vendors will accept it as tender (currency). Also, stop talking about it (and trading it) as if its a commodity. If you want it to be "one additional option" then stop claiming it as currency and/or a commodity. 
I couldn't care how you classify it, just don't contradict yourselves lol. That's why this subreddit community is laughed at -- none of you can completely agree on what Bitcoin is and/or what it should be used for, yet you want all these amenities to be associated with it because they'll ultimately add value to... whatever a Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:39:02
Ah yes, the positive feedback loop. Don't confuse luck with intelligence my friend. 
I made a fair 42% return in the market last year, so I'm not jealous or salty. In fact, if you've made money with Bitcoin, I'm happy for you! Hedging is diversifying your assets to mitigate exposure to risk of losses, and I do a very good job at that. 
Bitcoin however.... Not sure if this would be considered an optimal hedge with how much volatility is surrounding it. Common sense tells me to be risk averse because I have a lot more to lose than you (probably). When you start making big boy money, you'll be more careful about where your money is and how its performing. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:31:16
Well, this sub is called "Bitcoin", so yeah, I'd imagine it's a popular topic here lol.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:12:26
Let me ask you something:
if you own 5 Bitcoin and you lost your job tomorrow because your company is downsizing as a result of a recession, how are you going to pay for your bills, rent, gas, and food? Can you guarantee people are going to shove their money into Bitcoin during the downturn, or pull it out? Both? It's hard to tell or predict what people will do, but history does tell us that people prefer cash during these times.
Also, check out the S&amp;P 500's history. See those ebbs and flows? See how it always rises after periods of falling? Let me know when you understand a little more about how global economies work, and how insignificant Bitcoin is in the grand scheme of it all. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:35:46
So if all governments and sovereignty are against it, how will it succeed against retaliating legislation?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:56:13
So Bitcoin is technology? Or blockchain is technology? I'm talking about Bitcoin, which is the result of the technology, and is currently being traded as a commodity around the world. So yeah, it's a financial thing lmao. That's why there's billions of $ in it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:40:52
Then why are people trading it like it has some sort of value? Keep going, you'll realize the double standard soon.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:38:15
But wait, another thread just told me that Bitcoin was a commodity and not a currency. So who's wrong here?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:17:06
You're basically describing a majority of this subreddit. A majority of the *world* (including people in this community) don't know what asset class that a Bitcoin falls into. 
Granted, you and a handful of other people _think_ you know exactly what it is, but that doesn't help the valuation process in the real world. You guys promote it like it's the holy grail yet it doesn't have an established valuation -- it's just a volatile unknown asset right now. 
Though champions of Bitcoin are in agreement, the rest of the world isn't recognizing nor appreciating it in the same light. God forbid experts in the finance industry are trying to fully grasp the value of block chain and cryptocurrencies and you guys shit on them as if you're all prophets lol. Just appreciate that the rest of the world isn't as smart as you yet... christ.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:07:48
I think it's the fact that they're using Bitcoin as a vehicle for money laundering. Typically, money is laundered through a vehicle, and currencies aren't typically a vehicle unless you're exchanging them for other currencies through some complicated currency exchange scheme.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:30:25
This is wonderful! Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:46:41
No, they're controlled by companies, municipalities and financial firms who actually produce products and/or services for society. At least these investment options have a tangible value in the real world and (a majority) have withstood the test of time.
Don't tunnel vision so much on Bitcoin jungle juice that you lose common sense.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:45:15
Core BTC hodlers selling their BTC to pay for real-life expenses. This is something that will continue to trend over time. The irony.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:29:09
Then what's the underlying value of a Bitcoin if it doesn't have one? If centralized backs can make money out of thin air, isn't that the same concept that Bitcoin is introducing? It isn't backed by anything except a small community of trust. Seems unsettling to me.

Oh, your banks accept Bitcoin? Which Bank are you with? Which Gasoline pumps accept Bitcoin? And you're trying to convince me that the U.S. Government has already started accepting Bitcoin as tender for tax payments before Amazon or any other respectable retailer? 
Joke's on you because you're only lying to yourself here lol.
