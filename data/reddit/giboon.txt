I was thinking that the huge back log for onboarding clients at exchanges puts some pressure on prices, i.e. no new investor for a while. I am waiting for my bitstamp account for 3 weeks now.
What do you think?

@_date: 2018-01-22 06:42:26
Depends which coin. I mine alt coins from time to time and realized that some are working pretty well but some other are not. I am referring here to simplicity of use, rapidity of execution and fees.
I just feel now that there is a lot of pressure on prices.

Entered just before end of 2017. I was bored with people talking with apparently no clue about crypto currencies so I wanted to see by myself what it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:49:04
Why should it scale the the amount being transferred? For transferring fiat it is one single operation so the cost is the same either you transfer $50 or $50'000. 
Is it not the same with Bitcoin? (I am asking)

At this stage if the price goes back to $1000 it would be the result of a major change in outlook for the bitcoin, which would be a reason to sell, not the price itself. Btc investors should know by know that cryptos are highly volatile.

During the next financial crisis, cryptocurrencies will be seen as a safe haven.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:24:18
Same I'd better be on the realistic side vs the optimistic side. I understand that bitcoin was meant to transfer fiat currencies without 3rd party, not to create a new currency. At the end if the day money is money. If tomorrow i have to pay my bread in USD or in BTC I don't really care. It is the same money I earned from my job. I just dont want the price to swing 50% intraday like in Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
I like the enthusiasm about the technology and that's why I am here, but I know for sure that excesses will be punished by the market some day. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:48:15
Look, I am not talking about the current situation. The market is saturated with coins, technology both on the code side and hardware side needs improvement, acceptation of cryptos as mean of payment is not there yet and valuation are crazy.
But once the markets consolidates with few well established devlopped coins, we will see less volatility and better acceptance as equivalent to cash, which will prove useful when centralized markets fail, which happens from time to time. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:50:58
The price I had on Coinbase is shame. Feels like  a tourist who exchanged currency in a local bank where they say no commission but gives you a real shitty rate and they make 10-15% profit on the transaction.

They buy nodes and turn them down. There are many aspects if the technology that I dont know, I am no expert of btc. I just question the assumption that node owners are independently and not greedy.
What I understand is that someone could literally own the entire node network. Maybe this is erroneous.
If I may add: He who controls the nodes controls the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:25:29
Satoshi still has billions worth of coin hasn't he? I've read that there is also a shutdown button should the 51% hostile nodes treshold being reached. Although I don't believe that it is a Ponzi scheme because 1) it is not fraudulent and 2) there is no promise of return.
But sticking to the definition it is not so far, by attracting new investors you just make the price going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:20:04

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:19:43
Most probably to late to finance a lambo with that investment but it is an interesting bet on the future. From my point of view cryptos are transitioning from the euphoria to more slow growth and regulation phase. Once completed it will be easier and safer to use thus attracting more conventional investors.

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:39:53
Hi there,
I am trying to understand how the btc transactions work. If i want to buy let say 0.5 BTC, do I have to wait that someone sells that precise amount or are the orders grouped and allocated, i.e. if someone sells 1btc it could be allocated to 10 people wanting to buy 0.1btc?
Thanks for clarifying. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:27:38
And to add that even if the bitcoin is limited in number altcoins are not, i.e there is an unlimited number of altcoins. If seen as a commodity if you have unlimited offer I let you do the maths to calculate its value, which obviously differs from current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:34:35
Sorry for what you went through, hopefully you will learn something.
Generally, why are you guys not insured against fire and robery. This is insane.

@_date: 2017-12-05 06:31:16
Question now is how many people are only speculating and how many are really users. At the end I see btc as a way of paying stuff, value added for end user is so far limited.
Price will be driven only by how much money people are willing to put in. Simple arithmetic given than the btc offer is fix. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:32:34

It looks like the price I paid for my BTC is much higher than the market was at that time. What could explain?
The transaction is stamped today 12:48 (GMT+1) with a price of EUR 13k, but if I look at the chart provided on Coinbase at that time, the price was more like EUR 11.7k. Any clue what caused the different. Is it my bad, I should have placed a order with a price limit?

@_date: 2018-03-01 11:55:20
Sure it goes both ways, similarily I don't pay attention to crazy price forecast. We better stick to facts.
My main concerns now are:
1) still too low acceptance of Bitcoin as mean of payment.
2) Technical limitation (coin design, hardware, mining devices etc.)
3) the multiplication of altcoins
More supports from banks would be welcome. My take is that they dont want to get caught in Compliance, AML issues and dont want exposure should the market really crash while eliminating useless alts.
My base case hasnt change, cryptos are the future of money. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:41:31
Not saying it is right, but oversee payments are quite a manual process still especially if the banks have no direct SWIFT connection to each other. They need to go through an intermediary bank with additional fees. So you can make a payment for 0.30$ fees within the SEPA area but intercontinental payments are archaic. That's one of the problem cryptos are actually solving, not mentioning that cryptos are open 24/7. Just wanted to give some background. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:15:45

It is good to to stick to you initial strategy and time horizon. Just be ready to recalculate your base case probability of success regularly. I assigned 20% probability of failure to bitcoin to become recognized as an asset class, currency or whatever you like to call it.

I am not demonizing USD. I admit I have faith in cryptos taking over as reference currency in the next decades. And yes I'd be happier seeing +20% on my wallet than +20% even though I have no reason to sell. 
Price might be relevant at some point when BTC is not only attracting speculators.

Just before. it is more like a service at the bar place.

Because it is a buy and hodl strategy which means buying and tanking volatility for long term gains perspective. Weak hands fail to distinguish trading from investing.

It is paradoxal that people are investing to get some emotions, but for being a good investor one has to neglect her emotions and act rationally.

Will either cash out when there is no more future for it, i.e. long-term negative outlook. If this never happens I'll be just using my bitcoins to do grocery shopping.

Regret aversion is another emotional bias.

Well today international payments also take few days, have a cut-off time for execution and work only 5/7 day. Although there are some issues to fix, cryptos are 24/7. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:48:30
I assign 50% probability to this. State-owned cryptos will most likely happen in near future (&lt;5 years). But there is a scenario where independant cryptos exists or even impose themselves as reference currencies because of the free market. I assume this is long term best case for cryptos which could bring them to the moon. It would take much more time. Another decade or two perhaps?

Do you speculate on soy bean price as well?

Dont agree with you. I invested a modest amount just to "know" how it works and to have a feeling of what it is like inside of cryptocurrencies.
The experience and knowledge I gained over the past month is worth a thousand time the $500 unrealized loss so far.
But of course I did research, looked at code examples, got insights from conference (had one with President crypto valley association in Switzerland). But yeah, looking at the price confirms that not everyone had the same approach as me.
I dont know what is the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but if it becomes more widely accepted as a currency in few years from now, people going through this shit now will have a huge competitive advantage.

Nope, I just have 30 years ahead. I dont need the money now.

One more reason to buy cryptos, at least you do what you eant with your money.

Mining with 6x GTX 1070 either alts or with Nicehash when alt market is too volatile. Could turn off the heating in my 2 room flat. Electricity costs seems to equal saving on the heating. So I dont have additional costs.

And I'll say it again, define a time horizon for your strategy.

So yes got to divide GDP by velocity to get money supply and thus btc price derived from

Sure there is always a risk, and that's true for all industries, not banking in particular. Look at Diesel scandals or horse meat in Findus.

I am pretty sure you would not have the same speech if the price were 25k. That is where I dont care for now because i am not selling in any case.

ZCL even trades at $80. Never participated to a fork but Ill try buying some ZCL just to see how it works. Can be a good deal depending on future price if BTCP.

Hi Mark,
What lessons did you learn as an entrepreneur and won't repeat in the future?
