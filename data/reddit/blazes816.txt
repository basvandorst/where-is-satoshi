Fees aren't "charged", they're optional.  Miners have a natural disincentive to include transactions in blocks; it makes blocks larger and propagation slower.  If you don't include a transaction fee no miner is going to want to include your transaction.
Also typically the fees are payed the sender not the vendor, although there are experiments with allowing the receiver to pay fees if that is desired.
You should really read the white paper before purchasing or using any coins:

A solved block will pay out only to the address the miner used when finding the block.  You need to use a specific set of addresses for each pool so a block for one pool doesn't work for another pool.

(Keep in mind pulling this off requires significant mining power; using simple numbers for illustration)
Say the current block height is 99; i.e. there have been 99 blocks found since the beginning of Bitcoin.
You have 1btc.  You send it to an exchange and you mine it into the 100th block in the chain.  The exchange sees this and credits your account with ~$620 which you withdraw to your bank account.  The rest of the miners are still building on top of that block.
Then you start mining from the 99th block (again), which still states your address has 1btc.  You create another transaction sending the 1btc to a different exchange and mine it into the *new* 100th block.  Then you keep mining on this chain until it is longer than the original chain.
The original chain is now orphaned and your new chain the main chain.  The 2nd transaction now becomes valid in the eyes of the network and the 2nd exchange will credit your account which you can withdraw again.
Edit: Note that this assumes the exchanges accept 1 confirmation.  Each subsequent confirmation makes it more unlikely the attacker can make their new chain longer than the original one.  This is why in practice most places require more than 1 confirmation.

Yes but ensuring a valid transaction does not require a cryptographic chain of proofs of works for single machine. The chain of proofs of work provides Byzantine fault tolerance. If there is 1 machine, there is no need for Byzantine fault tolerance.

The other answer doesn't touch on the important part.  Transactions fees are supposed to be the miners incentive to mine.  *They* are the payment for mining.
Block rewards were added because Satoshi thought it seemed to be a fair way to initially distribute coins.  They are also helpful because at current prices/transaction volume the fees don't current provide *enough* incentive to mine.

What do you mean?  The Two Generals Problems has been an unsolved problems for decades (technically forever I guess), and it was only in the past 10 years that somebody (Szabo) first proposed a solution.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:37:49
Note: I ended up writing a whole bunch of stuff but I think (hope) it's useful.  The TL;DR is that a good scheme is generate your keys offline with electrum and print to paper.
There's a few angles to this that you need to consider.  The first and most important is that key generation is offline.  Typically when people refer to a paper wallet they mean one that was generated offline.  When they say Electrum, they typically mean an online Electrum installation running on your primary computer.
Both ways of storing keys can be done on or offline.  The important thing is that your "storage" coins be held in keys generated entire offline; a computer that will never touch the internet.  Otherwise you risk exposing the keys.
Other than that the differences in the storage medium really comes down to durability.  Simple drive failure can kill your digital copies and paper doesn't last forever.  I typically keep 2 digital copies and 2 paper copies of cold storage keys.
Another thing to consider is that most paper wallet generate generate a simple private/public key pair.  Electrum can generate a deterministic wallet with a 12 word mnemonic phrase.  That means that instead of needing a paper copy of every single address you use, you can create backups for only the master key and use it for all addresses derived from it.
This drastically reduces backup maintenance which is probably one of the number one causes of lost coins.

It is possible but I don't think there are any ready-made tools for this so you would need to code it up yourself.
Essentially you would be writing a custom boot loader that would check the drive to ensure it's the "correct" one (however you want to do that), and if so passes things off to your regular  operating system.
The issue with this, however, is that if an attacker as physical access to a machine they pretty much have it owned already.  You don't need to boot the computer to remove and search the drive.

The value is dropping the price is.  The price is essentially the markets best guess at a value, but it is not necessarily accurate.  This is standard market behavior.
To be more technical, the price is dropping because more people are selling than buying.  The price to buy a coin at is equal to the highest price somebody on the exchange is willing to sell it for.  If I sell that person all the coins they want to buy and nobody else wants to buy at that price, the price has gone down.

Bitcoin isn't something Gavin is trying to sell you.  People seem to forget that 10 years this was all a fantasy because we couldn't figure out how to make the math work.  Any malicious actor could destroy the entire system.
Then Nick Szabo figured out how that a cryptographic chain of proofs of work could protect against 49.999...% malicious actors.
Then Satoshi figured out how to make the economics work correctly to sustain the network.

Multibit uses what I call the BORK (Bag Of Random Keys) wallet model.  It generates some number (I think 10) addresses for you to use.  When you make a transaction, it takes an unused address and uses it as your change address.
When you backed up your wallet you backed up *only these keys*.
After time, Multibit needed to create more addresses and your coins would have started moving to these addresses as change.  If you didn't backup these new addresses' keys then they are gone.
This is why deterministic wallets are so popular.  You have a single private key and can generate any number of addresses from it.  Only that key needs to be backed up.  Popular implementations are Electrum and Armory.

"the blockchain" is the term for the specific cryptographic chain of proofs of work the Bitcoin network uses to establish consensus.  Proof of work chains will be very valuable in the future regardless of the value of bitcoin.

Mining does not ensure a transaction was created with the correct key.  Even if you could sign with a wrong key and broadcast it (you can't), no miner would pick it up as it is clearly invalid and therefore any block containing it would be invalid.
The mining process exists only to prevent double spending.  This is also why a 51% attack would only allow the attacker to double spend, not to spend coins he does not own.
You can't pretend to have the wrong key because it is obvious.  You may be able to jam it in the lock but it won't turn at all.

That depends on how you manage your coins.  If you the pi is the only place you have your private key(s) then if you lose it you lose yours coins.  It's not something you take with you to the comic book store, you keep it secured in a safe place.
I have my pi setup so I can plug it into a (non-networked) printer with a USB cable and print my keys to a paper wallet.
Everything is persisted to an SD card so if it breaks you just moved it to a new cold wallet.

No.  The coins would require 2 out of 3 private keys in order to move funds.  You have 2 (perhaps 1 on your phone and 1 on paper in a safe), they have 1.  At any point you can use your keys to move the coins wherever you would like.  It'd be a standard btc transaction with no element of centralization.
Or you can the trustedcoin service with only 1 of your keys.  If that key is compromised by malware or something you can cancel the transaction within the 24 hour period.

I think the question is, could you withhold the block from the pool, but submit it on your own and keep the entire block reward.
The answer is of course no, because the address to pay the reward to is part of the block.  Changing it from the pool's address to their own would invalidate their solution.

It's fairly normal for there to be double spend attempts.  18 isn't very many really.
They're all low amounts, nobody in position to succeed in a double spend with any confidence wouldn't waste the opportunity by doing it with a low amount.
They could be testing with a low amount, but if there was ever a confirmed double spend the price would probably plummet before they could do anything useful.

Obviously while there is no power, there is no electronic computation, and so there can be no transactions broadcast or blocks calculated.  The blockchain would still exist on thousands of computers and things would pick up where they left off if/when things are fixed.
Anybody that managed to have power still could mine, but there would likely be no nodes to accept those blocks.  Whenever power came back, they would start off from where they where when they lost power.

It couldn't be guaranteed but would be possible to do.  But your chances of successfully "undoing" the transaction gets less and less every second until a block is found.  Once the next block is found your chances are near 0.
So realistically you would only have a couple minutes to try, and your changes are constantly diminishing.
It would be easier to spend 3 minutes reviewing the transaction over and over again to ensure it's correct.  Obviously mistakes happen but we should not make it easier or more convenient to make them.

One thing I like to do is (on the offline computer used to generate the key) convert the private key to the corresponding address before sending any coins to it.  Alternatively, sign a message with it and then check with your pubic key.

This is why I feel you should always use multiple deterministic wallets for storage.  Many people think this defeats the purpose.  It still drastically reduces the number of keys you need to backup, but prevents any single key exposure from compromising all your coins.

They would just have an ASIC for each algorithm.  Some algorithms would be more difficult to make ASICs for than others, but specialized hardware is always going to be better/more efficient than the general hardware the average consumer owns and can afford.

Because to say it will never decrease would mean at the very least that Bitcoin goes forever which is very unlikely to happen.
When Bitcoin goes under whether that's in a year or 10 years or 1000 years the difficulty goes down to 0.
Even if it *does* go on forever, when the price goes down, people must stop mining.  This lowers the hash rate.  If Bitcoin goes forever there will very likely be a number of giant crashes to shake miners out of the game.  When that happens the difficulty is likely to decrease.
Not to mention attacks.  Altcoins suffer difficulty adjustment attacks all the time.  So far Bitcoin is pretty secure, but who is to say we will never see an attack on difficulty?
@_date: 2014-08-19 23:08:50
It is possible but not likely.  Every transaction increases the size of the block which decreases the chances that their block will be accepted due to increased time to propagate across the network.  If that happens they lose the entire block reward.
Note that there is current work on fixing this issue so that adding transactions to a block *won't* increase the time to propagate (or would only do so a tiny amount).  This should theoretically lead to reduced transaction fees.  It would also mean miners are more likely to include low/no transaction fees, but transaction fees are also for spam prevention so it seems unlikely to me a miners would try including all 0 fee transactions.

I will say that I trust Coinbase probably at least as much as any other Bitcoin company, but one of the major pillars of Bitcoin is the elimination of counter party risk.  The fact that you *have* to trust people is one of the biggest issues with other financial systems.
Moving your coins from Coinbase is a great first step in fully utilizing Bitcoin, but you should generate your own paper wallet offline and be the sole owner of the key.
The current ecosystem means this can be fairly difficult, especially for less tech-savvy people, but the more we rely on centralized crutches the less incentive we have to improve our means of managing our coins ourselves.
TL;DR Even if Coinbase is 100% trustworthy we should get the habit of managing these things ourselves, and work toward making this easier and more available to wider audiences.

It's a balance of the price of bitcoin, the cost of electricity, and the difficulty.
If electricity costs go up, or the price of bitcoin goes down, mining becomes less profitable to the point that miners must stop mining in order to not lose money.  When this happens the hash rate and therefore the difficulty go down.  This makes mining more profitable and miners start mining again increasing difficulty.
Since bitcoin has been rocketing in price, and the advancements in ASICs, the hash rate and difficulty have been rocketing as well.  But eventually things should level out.  If you look at a coin like Litecoin you can see it going up and down much more.

Your 10 character password with caps/punctuation/numbers/etc is likely not as secure as a well generated long (but plain english) pass phrase.
This XKCD comic spells out the issue pretty well: 
So if long passphrases are more secure, why are brain wallets generally viewed as unsecure?  The answer is entropy generation.  As a human, you are probably a poor generator of entropy.
For example, many people will use a page from their favorite book or poem, or a line from their favorite movie.  This makes your passphrase much easier to guess and likely to appear in pre-computed lookup tables.
If you were to use a cryptographic random number generator, and then use that number to determine a passphrase, it should be much more secure than a random 10 character password with all the special characters you mention.  This is how [Bip39]( works for example.

If you really want to have an idea of how much power they have, and how it's changing over time, you need to look at a much longer timescale.  This chart already shows them being back up to 35%.

I do not know the answer to why it does not use a moving average.  I do know there are various algorithms developed for alt coins that attempt to account for new hashing power faster.
What I wanted to comment on was that you are exactly correct about about it taking 10 minutes right after difficulty retargeting, and get's faster and faster until the next retargeting (assuming hashing power continues to increase of course).
Check out the chart labeled "Bitcoin Block Generation Time vs Difficulty" on this page: 
The red stair-step style line is the difficulty.  It is stair step like because it only changes once every 2016 blocks.  The grey and blue lines are moving averages of block generation time.  As you can see, right after the red line jumps the block generation time is about exactly 10 minutes.

If the limitations of PoW now mean Bitcoin is broken it has been broken since the beginning.  The limitations that we know of now were known then.
In fact when Bitcoin first started there was a single entity mining 100% of the coins so all time mining has become far more decentralized.

Yeah I work at a company similar to Zendesk that handles the same issues.   is actually a separate site than the rest of vaultofsatoshi.com.  It is on Zendesk's servers and sends Zendesk's SSL certs which causes a mismatch.
To resolve this Zendesk needs to host an SSL cert for VoS on their servers.  They probably have a misconfiguration causing it to not send the correct cert.
If you click through and check you will see it is Zendesk's valid cert so as long as you trust them you are fine (and anything you send will be on their servers so you *should* trust them).
TL;DR Don't send any sensitive info to support.vaultofsatoshi.com and you are fine.  The SSL warning doesn't really matter.

They own at least 50% of that hashing power.  People purchase mining contracts expecting a return.  GHash buys machines, mines, and pays out some of it to the contract holders.  But they are in complete control of the machines and the entire process.
Edit: When this happened back in January they clamed that 45% of their power was from their own hardware.  Not sure where that stands today.

By that I don't mean it's "incorrect", just that average blocks times are faster than the 10 minute target time.  It does not estimate what the hash rate is going to do, and so as the hash rate continues to explode blocks happen faster and faster.
If the algorithm took into account the increase of the hash rate and made the difficulty higher it could potentially do better at maintaining 10 minutes blocks.
This would mean that often blocks would take *longer* than 10 minutes right after the difficulty adjustment, and *slower* as we approach the next adjustment.  With the average being about 10 minutes.

The reason MtGox is so low is because you can't withdraw your coins.  If you could do that, then yes it would work well.

This lead to Gox being significantly higher because nobody could sell there for fiat.

The reward for mining should be halved about every 4 years, based on an average of 10 minutes per block.  The algorithm used to adjust difficulty to keep this schedule on track does not account for the rapidly increasing hash rate.  This means the halving will happen sooner.
All we know is that the reward will probably go from 25btc to 12.5 btc sooner than 4 years since the last halving.  We do not know how this will affect anything else at this point.

"Full clients" like Bitcoin core download the entire blockchain from other nodes, and validates every single transaction.

The price is an auction.  I would personally buy every available bitcoin for at least $1 regardless of that state of the network.  That puts a minimum bound on the price at TOTAL_SUPPLY/$1.  If the price went lower than that I would purchase them.  I'm sure there are others that would pay more.  That is why it could never hit $0, much less less than that.
A negative price would mean that you would have to pay people to take them.  That "can't" (I.e. it's very unlikely) happen because even if it was worthless you could just delete or forget about your wallet.

Mining is almost 100% inaccessible to "regular" people.  There are groups of people with millions of dollars developing chips that can mine more in a second than your laptop or desktop PC can do in its entire lifetime.  laptop/desktop processors are "general purpose" processors in that they were made to do most any arbitrary computation.  The big boys in the mining world can manufacture chips that can do the same computation a billion times in the time that a general purpose CPU can.
The times of the little guy making anything by mining are over.  If you participate you will almost certainly lose money.  Personally I mine for the fun of it, but I understand that I will be paying more in electricity than I will make.

Some wallets work that way but it's insecure because you're using human generated entropy.  You should use bip39 in which you do needs the exact same word list because the phrase is derived from a secure random key instead of a key being derived from an insecure non-random entropy source.

In the case of bip39 you actually do need the exact same word list.  Many people just hash their words and use the result as a key.  This causes issues because people are bad at choosing words.
With bip39, you generate a secure random key and then derive the words *from* the key instead of the other way around.  The words translate to numbers, so if you have a different word list (or words in a different order) you can't get the key back.

Yes you spend some coins to an address for use in the network. This address is a 2-of-2 address between you and the recipient so both of you must sign to move the coins in it. However, before you send the coins you receive a pre-signed "refund" transaction from the recipient which spends the coins back to you after a period of, say, 24 hours.
As you spend on the network you're sending signed, valid, transactions to the receiver of the funds. Those transactions send only a tiny portion of the funds you've set aside for the Lightning Network at a time; the rest is sent to a change address. Every time you want to spend more coins you create a new transaction sending a little bit more to the recipient and a little less back to yourself. 
Every 24 hours the final transaction will be issued to the blockchain and become permanent. If the other end just goes away and never finalizes the transactions, you would get all of your funds back by signing and sending the refund transaction you received at the beginning.
The only downside is that the funds you set aside for use on the LN are unavailable for use outside the LN until after the 24 hours.
(24 hours is configurable but is the most often used example)

The primary catch is that you have to set coins aside for use on the Lightning network, and they will be unavailable for use outside the network for some predetermined amount of time (e.g. 24 hours).
That's really about the only thing. You're sending valid, signed, transactions around that both parties agree to and can issue to the blockchain at any point in time.  Cryptographically speaking, neither party can cheat the other and can be confident in the security of the unconfirmed transactions they are sent; meaning safe 0-conf transactions.
And since many multiple "logical" transactions are grouped into one large "physical" transaction the fees for each "logical" transaction can be miniscule. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:56:01
Miners do not work for anyone but the network.
They need full nodes to propagate blocks and full nodes only forward blocks they agree with. The nodes therefore also vote. Those making up the economic majority (coinbase, bitpay, etc) are the most influential.

@_date: 2015-08-14 16:52:19
No brain wallet will ever be secure ever in any capacity because it's ridiculously efficient to generate and store their keys and check incoming transactions against them.
I write and maintain a bot which sweeps brainwallets (and attempts to send the coins back to more secure address if possible) and it is written to try multisig addresses.  It's a marginal increase in complexity.  It has swept more than one multisig address, at least one 3of5.  Larger values of n and m can only hide you for so long.

The reason for sidechains, which Elements was largely built to help test, is so we can have other coins and chains that work differently and people are free to move coins around them.
Elements is largely testing this idea; not just things like Schnorr signatures.
This opens the door to development a ton by allowing all developers to try things out without having to mess up the Core base.

How do they get all these things?  Over the Internet.  A decentralized system.  People will, and already do, choose centralized systems built on top of Bitcoin.  People use Coinbase to store the coins for them and they use SPV wallets.
That doesn't mean that the underlying system won't greatly benefit from being decentralized and open source just like the Internet does.
Edit: I do want to say that I don't know that Bitcoin will "win".  A centralized company could come along and totally kill Bitcoin and dominate a lot of the good use cases for Bitcoin.  I just think that's undesirable from my opinion, and I also think Bitcoin *could* "win".

I should've been more clear here. The funds would be for use with a specific Lightning node/operator.
You put the coins in a 2-of-2 address where you have one key and they have the other. Before moving your coins to that address you'll receive a transaction which spends the coins back to you in 24 hours; so even if the node operator disappears you can get your coins back then.
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:22:04
It was spending outputs from F2Pool who also mined in.  The transaction was large enough that most nodes won't propagate it.  So they almost certainly made and mined the transaction and therefore did not care about fees.

Yes if he found the new block 90 and then block 91, and his block wins any potential "block race" of other miners finding a block 91 around the same time, then his new block 90 would be the one in the main chain.

Adam Back is certainly much smarter than I will ever be, but I don't know that I'd agree he's a "greater mind" than Satoshi.  
Bitcoin wasn't a multi-billion dollar system when Satoshi was around but he clearly saw that potential.
Sidechains are not a magic bullet and currently only provide SPV-level security which makes them a non-starter for many uses.  They're also not currently viable whereas we could need larger blocks very soon.
I know you're a troll, so I will discontinue the conversation here.  I just wanted to make sure other people could see that hard forks are not some evil abomination, at least not according to Satoshi.

@_date: 2015-07-07 02:07:39
Unfortunately I don't think there is much to do now.  The way Bitcoin currently works is that most nodes only accept the first transaction from an address.  If a 2nd transaction trying to spend the same coins comes along they just ignore it.
is working on getting "Replace By Fee" implemented which would allow you to send a new transaction sending those coins back to yourself instead of to the hacker by giving a larger fee.  The downside however is that the attacker could just send all the coins as a fee so neither of you gets them; some miner will.

Yes, even if you are mining on an Apple Watch (i.e. very low hash power) there is a small chance you could get 2 (or even more) blocks back to back in a very short window.  But this isn't really cheating anything, it's just getting lucky.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:45:27
I suspect there will be competing Lightning Networks, some of which are made up of large, entrenched, companies that comply with all regulations (i.e. the Coinbases and Circles of the LNs) while the BTCes and SatoshiDices of the world create another network.
I haven't read as much about LNs as I need to, but perhaps routing will work such that there could be "compliant" nodes and non-compliant nodes and users' transactions could route through either.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:11:10
Correct, Bitcoin is not perfect and still has some short comings.  One of those being that it's built using technology that the average human does not yet understand.  Similar to how 30 years ago they didn't understand why an "a" would have a loop around it.

I think the advantage a totally open system has is the talent it can attract.  There are are far more people working on Bitcoin than there would be if Satoshi had launched it as a private company.  And they're doing a far larger range of things than a company with constrained resources could or would do.

Yes, it would be nice if there was an easy, streamlined way to get just Bitcoin Core + the block size changes.  So you should make it.  Set up the build process that mike_hearn doesn't want to bother with and buy bitcoinmegablocks.com and offer it for download.

Then how do we increase the max blocksize without a hard fork?  I'm fairly sure the last time I asked you that the answer was by using sidechains, which does not increase the max blocksize of the Bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:26:59
Exactly.  The hard cap was not a mistake.  Hard forking, while not ideal and a bit dangerous, is not the end of the world some people seem to think.  Satoshi always intended to change the hard cap with hard fork.  See Jeff Garzik's [original proposal thread on Bitcoin Talk](

Like it or not the Internet, and Bitcoin, are meritocracies not democracies.  What you can build is what people can use.


Yes, our lives are finite resources.  You have to choose how you want to use them.  Mike Hearn who created BitconJ and BitcoinXT, and the Conformal developers who write BTCD, have given up potential things they could have done with their lives.  These are opportunity costs that they paid in order to contribute to, and therefore vote on, the Bitcoin ecosystem.




Not that I know of, but that would be a great thing to have; you should build it.

@_date: 2015-07-21 02:17:22
That's not how it works.  Just because you can exchange BTC for USD does not mean it's backed by that.  You can also exchange it for pizza.
Somebody could set up an exchange market for trading BTC for pepperoni pizzas, and then there would be a BTC/pepperoni-pizza exchange rate.  That does not mean BTC is backed by pizzas.
BTC has some value.  Other things also have value.  An exchange rate BTC/something should, through market forces, tend toward a 1:1 ratio in terms of value.

Yes, the node you prefer to use.  The person you want to send money to must also be connected to the network.  You do not need to do a handshake directly with the person you want to pay for coffee.  You do not need to use the same node.
The nodes are all connected to each other with their own payment channels.  As you send payments to node A, it routes it through a network of payment channels to node B, which the merchant is connected to.


Just like with Bitcoin those things are not part of the protocol. Undoubtedly there will those that "play by the book" (think Coinbase and Bitpay) and there will those who skirt the rules (think BTCe and SatoshiDice).


Just like owning coins for 24 hours is a gamble on the price, or how owning USD is a gamble on the price of it, yes. I don't expect week-long channels to be common but if they are just don't use them if you're worried about it.

On top of this, never ignore SSL warnings.  If you're on a public network, it's fairly trivial to fake SSL sessions other than it shows a warning to the user about it not being a valid cert.  As long as you actually pay attention to those things you should be fine.

Only because he didn't know when it should be lifted.  He had every intention of it being raised eventually as he outlines [here](




    maxblocksize = largerlimit
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:51:40


Having argued with him before, I think he believes that for some reason off-blockchain transactions can somehow count towards block data size.  IIRC (not trying to put words in your mouth; correct me if I'm wrong) he believes that if you can transmit a billion GB worth of transactions over the lightening network and compact it into a single 1MB block, it counts as "increasing the block size".
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:42:51
This is something that I think many people don't realize.  With the Lightening Network for example, there is a serious security risk if the LN nodes are unable to get a transaction mined in a timely manner.  If a channel operator can't get the closing transaction mined quickly enough, the payee can take all his coins back.
I don't see how we can avoid larger blocks at all.  I don't know that we need to rush to raise the limit, but I definitely think it will be required at some point.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:36:08
Do not take serious investing advice from @_date: 2015-08-14 16:57:40
This is a very important point about their position I think a lot of people don't understand. I don't think anybody is worried about catastrophic real transaction value immediately, but with a giant network that's as complex at Bitcoins there has to be time to get infrastructure in place.
Big tech companies just release things one day seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality it takes a long time and a lot of work. With Bitcoin this process happens transparently and so people have to see it far sooner.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:52:11
Regardless of why any particular hard fork might not be ideal right now, the fact is that if we want to increase the maximum block size we must hard fork and there is no way around that.

Users and miners of that chain; same for any other altcoin. The only difference between a sidechain and a "regular" altcoin is that you can send coins between the Bitcoin chain and the sidechain, and back again.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:21:22
And afterwards they rolled back the chain and took his coins.  It's absolutely possible, it's just very difficult.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:27:37
Yes but there is more computing power working against the attacker than he himself has.  If he has more power than the is working against him, then he could rebuild the chain with his altered block.
Even if the attacker had that amount of computer power the network incentives are aligned such that he should make a larger profit by mining honestly than by attacking the network.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:43:01
Assuming large blocks fail to gain adoption, do you have ideas on fixing the existing mining centralization?
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:39:29


An attacker would be interested in changing blocks containing transactions they've made.  If that's block 90 then that's the one they want to change.  In this scenario, the attacker would have made a transaction in block 74 that he wants to undo.


Why would they want to do that?  If they find 2 blocks in a row then they get 2 block rewards.  If they try to go back and rebuild those blocks for some reason they will likely end up losing both rewards as other miners find and distribute those blocks first.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:36:26
A proper hardware wallet would be unable to communicate with the Namecoin, or any other, network.  There could theoretically be a "contact" system like with phones where you can import a username and HD pub key to the device which could be cool.
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:59:30
When somebody makes a transaction they send it to all nodes they know about.  Some nodes build new blocks (mine), others just validate transactions and pass them on to other nodes.  Eventually the transaction will be passed through a bunch of validating full nodes to a miner who should confirm the transaction at some point.
So a full node propagates valid transactions around the network based on its own hard-coded rules.  A miner builds a valid block out of some number of valid transactions, also based on its own rules.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:57:10
They're the ones that make all the things.  If you want bigger blocks you can make your own Bitcoin node with bigger blocks and try to get everybody else to use it.

Just like corporations and universities pay to put the "best/brightest devs" on payroll to work on Internet related projects.  The entire ecosystem still gets a substantial benefit from the OSS community.
A "revolving door of Bitcoin devs" would create *more* consensus and cohesion I suspect.
We will have trouble establishing real decentralization as long as you guys still care so much about Bitcoin Core and continue to rally around a single implementation.  Decentralization isn't supposed to mean people bitch on Reddit about what Core devs should do.  It means they're free and able to build what they prefer instead.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:42:12
A bad actor would focus on changing whichever block contains the transaction that they want to undo.  They would want it to be closest to the end of the chain to minimize the amount of chain they need to rebuild.  This is why different places require different numbers of confirmations depending on the value be transacted.
The number of confirmations a transaction has just means the number of blocks found since that transaction made it into the chain.

@_date: 2015-07-21 20:40:31
AFAICT from polpolrene's explanation, when you make a transaction some group of nodes must validate it before it can be counted as having happened.
The nodes which must validate it are (somehow, not sure how) deterministic so you can't get another group of nodes to validate a transaction sending the coins somewhere else.
I have not read much about it, but it sounds dubious to me.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:22:22
Conformal (the company producing btcsuite) is doing great work in building thoroughly tested, rigorous, safe Bitcoin code.  The major thing for me as a software developer, is that they're using Go instead of C++.  This eliminates a large class of bugs related to memory access.  The Go ecosystem also promotes strong testing and has great tools for testing/debugging complex code.
I personally write some BTC related software in Go and have been watching Conformal for a while and they are one of the most productive teams I've ever seen writing BTC software.  And it's good software as well.  I use their full node implementation as my default, and I use a lot of their code in my custom, personal, hardware wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:04:58
Correct.  They could, and in theory eventually would.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:28:33
True, but I was actually talking about the "scorched Earth" policy that accompanies RBF and in that scenario I would suspect the miners would (eventually) stop returning all-fee or mostly-fee transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:34:28
I fully agree.  I think Lightening Networks and Sidechains will (or at least could be) great improvements to the network.  But that does not mean we can live with 1MB blocks forever.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:01:05
This makes it sounds like once block 91 is found, all the work the attacker has done is useless.
In reality, finding block 91 just means now he needs to find 19 blocks instead of 18.  And if block 92 is found he'll need to find 20 blocks, and so on.  Since the rest of the network has (much) more computation power than the him, it should always find new blocks faster than the him, so he can never catch up.
It is a far more succinct way to explain it than I've ever thought of, it would just be nice if they could address that issue.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:31:20

The price is determined by market participants buying and selling.  "Manipulation" is just buying and selling in strategic manners.  If a whale sells a ton of btc to induce a panic, he is actually participating in the market by selling coins and uncovering weakness in the market by causing others to sell as well.  It's not manipulation, it's just the market in action.  If you dislike it you should seek out non-market driven assets that are propped up by governments.
If the market crashes it's because a holder of coins sells more than people are willing to buy and that's just an underlying weakness.  In the case of leveraged trading, those coins are borrowed from others with interest and still constitute an attitude toward market direction.

Not sure what you mean.  Firstly, I think the graphic is *mostly* true, just a bit misleading in the once case I pointed out.  Secondly, what I said is true for all transactions, not just coinbase transactions.
In any case finding block 91 does not invalidate the work the attacker has done on rebuilding blocks 74+, it simply gives the attacker a little more work to do after finding block 90, whereas otherwise he'd have been finished.

My answer was premised on them maintaining 51% hash power over a long period of time for any reason, even if it's irrational.  And I was saying that they would produce more blocks which they would regardless of if they're being honest of not.

Every transaction included in a block increased the size of the block.  The larger the block is, the longer it takes to propagate across the network.  This means that every transaction added slightly increases the chances that another block will be accepted first.  Miners make their own decisions on whether or not transactions are beneficial to a block based on the size of the transaction (in bytes) vs the fee paid (in bitcoin).

Your TV might not having mining chips in, but could include the rest of the stack.  It may include mining chips, but they would be to support the 21 pool, not directly to pay for shows.  The onboard chips are only useful for the products utilizing the consensus aspect over the transfer of value one.


It allows the owner to convert electricity into satoshis without an exchange.  Again, the goal of these chips is not be provide profit, but to give automated systems liquidity.


The transactions pieces of most things do not need to be CPU intensive.  All the examples I mentioned could easily be build on an RPi with a ton of overhead left.


How does a world wide fleet of automated passenger jets coordinate flight plans without potential malicious interference?


I know how micropayment channels work, and know that they are not the solution to everything.  You can call it junk but you're not the one putting up capital to decide so the network doesn't care about you.

It's not about fridges communicating with each other about what bad vs good milk is like, it's about self driving cars negotiating for parking spaces and paying for electricity.

$400 is the price for what is very clearly a development kit.  We can only suspect, but as they get further along most likely 1) the price will come down, 2) they will offer products which use the same infrastructure but do less.
The goal of the mining chips is not to make money.  The ecosystem 21 is trying to build is one for the IoT, where the price of a bitcoin in USD does not matter.  Its use is all about consensus and a single satoshi is enough to create an entry in the ledger.
The goal is two-fold.  One is to supply a stream of satoshis that the device can use.  The second is to create a large mining pool that will mine all of these single-satoshi transactions with 0 fees.

I'm not an economics expert by any measure, but I've thought for a long time that this would be the best solution.  I believe that there is a maximum block size determined by the market just like the price is.
I think the main issue is that miners will create many more orphan blocks during the "cap discovery" process which may draw them to coins with a pre-defined cap.

The blockchain is a timestamp data structure, which itself is not in any way interesting or unique, but it's designed to allow permissionless, trustless, distributed participants. By making a "private blockchain" you're just creating a timestamp server with cryptographic signatures and proofs.
Similarly, there's no such thing as a blockchain without a token of value, because for it to be useful you have to be able to make entries. If you can make entries and the blockchain is useful in some way that entry will have value. It's a token of value.
A blockchain only exists with an underlying currency token. Perhaps the winning chain will be an altcoin, not Bitcoin (I personally doubt it), however there is way to separate the two concepts.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:44:13

It's completely valid.  They could include 0 transactions if they wanted, but of course they'll almost always want to take the reward so there's at least 1 transaction.
Every transaction you include slightly increases the chance your block may be orphaned.  If the available transactions don't pay enough fees that it seems worth including them then a miner won't.

No idea what issues Cryptsy is trying to cite but with Gox the story they gave is that they would automatically resend transactions that never made into the chain after a certain amount of time. They monitored those transactions by TX hash, so if the mutated transaction made it into the chain the attacker gets the money and then later Gox sends them more. They kept doing this over and over.
AFAIK this is plausible, but this issue has been known forever and monitoring transactions by hash is incorrect and unsafe.
