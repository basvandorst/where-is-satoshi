Oh yes, that's right! Or maybe an untraceable blockchain with its own cyrptocurrency. I mean, the possibilities are endless and technology keeps evolving. We will never know until it's there.

I'm sorry I don't get it. Can you please elaborate?

Okay I get you. I guess I've been thinking too much and have been connecting the digital currency to the virtual world because well, they are both technically digital. I guess we just have to wait and see what happens next. Thank you for your valuable thoughts.

I agree and this is exactly what I meant when I said they were looking at the bigger picture. They got greedy with the promise of a huge returns hence skipping the basics which is actually just requires the use of common sense.

Perhaps you're right. Perhaps, the Virtual World has actually already started and just needs fine tuning thru the years to come. Perhaps, it's not cryptos that will remain as the only currency once the Virtual world is fully complete but some apps as mode of payments.

Yeah that's basic but maybe those are what are being over looked by those who had been victims of those scams. They must have been looking at the bigger picture skipping the basics. Thank you. I'll keep it in mind.

Great point! Both options can be true and personally, I think, many years from now, maybe even decades, more cryptocurrencies will come out in the market. Ones that will be specifically designed for a virtual world should we come to that point. Where it will function like cash, credit cards or what have you except that everything will be completely digital/virtual.

Hmm sounds like pretty valid predictions. Thank you for that. 
Thinking way ahead, when no physical cash will be needed anymore since apparently, there is already a group of scientists working on creating a virtual world, is it safe to say that there will be a specific type of currency that will be designed specifically for that world but will still be no entity to handle it?

Oh yes! This is exactly what I meant! Thank you so much!
I've heard of a project called Virtenity which apparently aims to convert the physical world into a sort of digital or virtual world including humans. Looking at from their point of view, nothing will be done physically anymore including all transactions that require payments hence I was just thinking that all currencies will be demised then and only cryptocurrencies will remain. I see your point why it won't be bitcoin but maybe more digital currencies designed specifically for that world will come into the surface by then, many many years from now. ;)

I get you. So, will the better question be "Will cryptocurrencies be the only currencies left should our whole world turned digital?"
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:47:46
Yeah that's what I'm thinking too but just thinking way ahead, let's say many decades from now, with the evolving technology and some studies on creating a digital world, what is the possibility of these digital currencies, bitcoin included, to remain as the only type of currency which by that time, could be mandated by governments? Of course, it's a hypothetical question. :)
