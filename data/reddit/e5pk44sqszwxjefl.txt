Ok, I give up... 1hr 5minutes in. This is pure garbage. Don't watch this. There is no substance here, no one knows about Bitcoin here. Everyone thinks "blockchain" is the future, and there is some other use for it except money.
Some final comments:
Mr. Jeremy - "blockchain" technologies interest. Created US-dollar coin. Has interest that is contrary to bitcoin.
Professor - thinks "blockchain" is the same as a bank or a private business, which can decide how to "mint" coins.

Every time you make a transaction you destroy the "coins".
So if you pay for ice cream 0.5 BTC and you hold a balance of 1.5 BTC, you will destroy 1.5 BTC completely and create two new "coins" 0.5 BTC and 1 BTC (change).
By "coins" I mean UTXOs (look em up).

If you knew when “dips” were it would be dumb to buy at any other time. 
It is impossible to determine “dips”, as the price can keep dropping. Conversely, if the prices rises sharply by 10 and drops by 5 - is that a dip of 5 or a rise of 5?
I’ll prove this dip crap is nonsense - go ahead, identify the next 3 “dips” when they happen.

All of this is useless when you can’t unlock your trezor in 6 months. 
Here is what you need to do:
1.	Receive small among of btc first (buy it somewhere)
2.	Erase your trezor.
3.	Recover from your seed. 
If you’re scared to do  it means you don’t have reliable seed backup. 
Most first time bitcoin users loose the first seed. 
Write (don’t print it) your seed on 3 pieces of paper (make three copies - don’t use any splitting scheme or smart secret encoding - you will 100% forget what you did) and save them somewhere.

It is not clear to me what the evil side of BitPay is. If bitcoin is open they are free to do what they want. 
The question I have is why no one else created a hosted alternative to BitPay (not the one people need to be sys admins to install) to compete using only standard bitcoin protocols?
I suspect that it is pretty hard to enter this market. Also it seems like a better job fir lightning layer than the bitcoin itself - so any payment provider that settles every transaction on the blockchain immediately will face similar challenges.
