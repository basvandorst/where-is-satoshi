Not really.  His parents probably are in something like CheckSystems and cannot get a checking account,  most likely because they overdrafted their account and never payed the bank.

I haven't had any problems with ally bank either.

Telling a bot to fuck off is the equivalent to yelling at an voice-activated automated phone system.

The price is at a recent high. Don't be surprised if it drops %10 percent right after you buy it.

ELI5 why the halvening makes the price rise.

GBP was down over 6% a little while ago.  People are fleeing somewhere.  BTC is likely to get a trickle of that.

The bad thing is it brings in bandwagoners who buy at the high price thinking it's going to moon and then they feel burnt when it drops. But there's no way to prevent it I suppose.

It's a joke dude

Extending your point a bit; Churches don't ask for your name when you put money in the collection plate either.

Because no one really knows.

Didn't Boeing and Lockheed build Curiosity as a joint project with JPL though?

Tactless and maybe not to well thought out, yes. But it's just hyperbole, saying it's some kind of racist dog-whistling is ridiculous. You are the real race-baiter here. Maybe not conscientiously, but no one was even mentioning race until you did.

That's not what race baiting means lol. Here's how the Oxford English dictionary defines it: 


 What you did was race baiting. It's the textbook definition. You brought up race when there was no reason to. You basically accused someone of being racist when they weren't and started an argument because you don't like their politics. And don't say they brought it up either. Slavery was referring to the involuntaryness of taxes not somehow making white people like black people.  Slavery is a concept and doesn't exclusively mean the history of black people being enslaved in the US.

Yea I get they used the word slavery, but don't you think it has to do with the involuntary nature of the system? I don't see how you can make the stretch to racism from that alone. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:10:56
I'll say it again since you obviously didn't read to the bottom of my last comment. Slavery is a concept and in this case is referring to be being forced to do something against one's will, and has zero to do with the history of slavery in the US. The two ideas aren't mutually exclusive. 
 If your argument is this is insensitive to the reality of actual slavery, I agree. But to claim it was done to exploit racial tension is all in your head. But if I'm wrong please explain it to me.

Should've bought $1600 worth at $1550. It's fun increasing your position. And how is it stupid to have just made a quick 50 bucks? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:32:58
TIL it is impossible for an American to talk about slavery without meaning Amnesiac slavery. All those pastors reading Exodus in church, they're not talking about the Hebrews, nah it's all code for black people. When Nine Inch Nails sings about happiness in slavery, they aren't referring to existing in the modern rat race, nah they're just a bunch of white supremacists. 
You don't even know if the person who referred to taxes as slavery is American, it's likely they are but also completely irrelevant.

Coinbase let's me cash out up to $10k a week to my bank account, but if you verify your account fully that number goes up to 100k.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:54:37
 I'm not sure, I've never dealt with anything larger than 10k. Maybe someone else can answer.
