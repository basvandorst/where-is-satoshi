Hello 
dobar dan
Yeah but this new ban does not allow new technologies to come only crappy shit, and its not impossible to move there because nobody wants us ,because our politicians steal every damn penny , to be clear one company donated 1 000 000 to flood victims they said something like we needed that money to fix something two days lather they rise they own paychecks i hate this shit, so wrong, i see people are dying of hunger, but nobody care the minimum wage here is 145 $ but living coast is 300$ idk how I will survive the in this shit.
Now they are forcing us to give 5% of our paycheck for flood victims, for us it is obligatory for them it is not.
God dam it.
I love bitcoin the whole idea, i hate these banks they ruin everything,they find 100000 ways to take many from u , there is a tax percentage ? there is money due ?...  
i have paycheck of 300$ and i give every month 10$ to bank for "taking care of my money" WTF?
and guess what i cant get my paycheck in cash, and i have to go to fucking bank.
but thing will be better soon i hope so, at least i have 45-55 more years to  death . LOL
