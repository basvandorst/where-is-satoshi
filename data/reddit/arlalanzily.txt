After about a month of owning a Coinbase account they let you transfer your money to Coinbase pro (formerly gdax or something). Over there, the fees are like 0-1%...I heard. I’m currently in the process of getting my money un-held by Coinbase. So I can transfer to the Coinbase pro exchange. So far I am straight up not having a good time . Tbh I’m probably going to withdraw and go back to my stock broker .

Relatively. when it surges. I’m using gap as a term, not literal. Because every “gap” can be zoomed in enough to show increments. Every spike or fall within the past few weeks shows as “gaps” on every btc chart, granted you’re not looking at minute-by-minute candlesticks.

I appreciate the enthusiasm but can I be that guy for a second and say: what the hell are you all smoking? This is such a corny idea. who the hell would buy this? People wouldn’t even buy this with Usd to begin with. It’s hard for convenience stores to peddle chapstick to the average consumer. Most of them get stolen from Walgreens and cvs. So back to my original statement, why the hell is some random guy in a fedora selling lip balm out of his trench coat? And to make things even more convoluted, he is advertising his get rich quick scheme on the packaging.

people keep misconstruing this imaginary safety net hovering around 7k. NEWS FLASH PEOPLE: THE BOTTOM IS ZERO DOLLARS AND ZERO CENTS. I am not saying that this is headed for worthless BUT I am saying that the price has literally no direction to go but up down sideways.

He’s gaining street cred and bragging rights via tagging a highly visible freeway overpass with his “gang’s” insignia... this has nothing to do with bitcoin. B.t.c. Probably stands for something that they believe in/ belong to. Representing themselves. /graffiti101

that would be funny if all of these “testimonials” are intricate bot accounts. And somehow “Dave” is making a killing on Reddit “recovering” bitcoin wallets ������

there should be some sort of bloat-free app / software that sends push notifications informing about gap ups and freefalls. Maybe even a customizable tool that alerts your phone whenever btc fluctuates more than 500$ or so in either direction. it would eliminate the need for constant chart checking (granted that you aren’t as hopelessly addicted as some of us are).

Or it trades sideways for a year. ending up at 5-6k before the next moon to 9k...

total garbage . Downvoted. good thing for you is that it doesn’t matter that completely likeminded buffoons invest into this stuff , so in theory, it’s beneficial to your cause regardless of your autism levels peaking.

Forbes LITERALLY let’s anyone with mild credentials and a laptop write articles for them these days. Such a disgrace to whatever tiny legacy they had associated with their name from yesteryear... Forbes is the new buzzfeed . Maybe even Viceland level douchey too.

A majority of graffiti artists are degenerates. But don’t forget to acknowledge the fact that some “taggers” have upwards of a quarter million followers on social media. A simple freeway stunt like this can accumulate paint sponsorships, graffiti groupies, art endorsements...etc $$$

this is cringe af. Almost equivalent to a picture of some musty dude in a gaming chair fapping it to an oiled sailor moon on his iPad while there’s some weeb forum going on in the background displayed on the battle station.
edit: to add insult to injury, netting negative profit while trying to look cool with the “mysterious algorithmic chart” aesthetic on your screen.

Because it looks like a pill.

If you search the bitcoin atm locations in San Francisco all you get are bodegas and crackhead liquor stores. Such a weird juxtaposition with this intersection of crypto and retail... I understand the method to an extent but it largely confuses me too.
You would think that a bitcoin atm would carry the same aesthetic as an apple store or even a Walgreens maybe. But even in the big metropolitan areas, the only place you can find these transactions are in skid row and tent city districts.
Westfield shopping mall was the ONLY exception, but even then there was a huge downfall. The fees were 7.5% like wtf.
