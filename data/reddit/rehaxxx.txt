its just %1 difference. it's normal. cryptoexchanges does not play on same pool like forex and regular exchanges does. Every crypto exchange has their own pool where their members does trade in between. and your example of difference is not more than %1 so its very normal
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:28:13
as i explained its because of different traders different sell/buy pools. if transaction fees are higher than the difference between exchanges people wont move and equalize the price. if difference is higher people tend to move between exchanges and gain someprofit while equalizing the difference.

Heard it in 2013 i was poor college student and there wasnt a way to pay them to get BTC with my countries currency to usd or paypal because of paypal stopped supporting my country. long story short i was very interested through time i forgat it. last year heard it again. and bought when i remembered my entuhisiasim and interest in the project.

@_date: 2019-11-30 17:18:06
İts probably not possible to get them back. but reporting the wallet, and tracking the next few transfers from that qallet and reporting those too, will make those BTC unavailable to use in most exchanges. its a different story thou, if the hackers use a mobile hardware and sell it on black market. getting those coins back is harder than you think.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:20:29
to use only one currency is impossible even for americans, because of location changes, goverments inisiate new types, wars, crisis, if i remember correct a standart person will use atleast different 3,4 currency trough their life (even europe went through local currency to euro , and euro changed shapes and colors many times)

using an exchange and blaming the bitcoin is like putting your money into a bank and blaming the money for not being in your hand. use your own wallets and you can send/receive it 7/24

good gift idea, i have done this to so many friends of mine while btc was 4k earlier this year. they are thanking me now with their newly earned free 100$  :) ha ha they never ever cared about the 50$ gift back then. now they are full of hype
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:40:32
yeah its the price per bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:07:04
Value does not mean inflation, my btc wont increate on my pocket (value of dolar equal will), your question is flawed. its like asking why the tax rate is not %100 instead of 20~. 
They can not tax something they dont understand
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:40:25
trade on somewhere else then. Because if an exchange stops you from trading when you need it the most. it doesnt matter big or small its means tbey only care about their own profit and shitty customer service.
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:37:32
Which exchange is this? my exchanges still do let me trade.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:16:50
i make money for years. i dont care about bull or bear because of my long time holding and daily trade strategy combination, but alts are still going down and down and not going up for most. so saying we are in absolute bull is not correct. we still dont have an ATH ON BİTCOİN. when we get it then we can officially declare the bull season.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:33:25
Does government tax you for keeping your money in your pocket? No. then why would they tax bitcoin holders?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:01:33
rising in one day and falling in the next does not mean bull is back. bear was here for 2years. if bt rises for the next 3month too we will be official bull
@_date: 2019-12-31 11:25:16
let say %10-15of the population can use risky value products. so if population growth continues  and bitcoin goes mainstream then we can see that numbers in 50-150years. (if world dont die  before)

internet seems to be decentralized. But it is not. Governments can shut down and many of them actually does that on despotic countrirs today.

its easy for me. if they accept to pay with BTC we calculate the price fiat/btc rates and they simply sends the coins to my wallet. no tax needed. because our government didnt put taxes nor regulations on Crypto yet.
