Ironically if many people like you didn't spend their BTC it may not be what it is today... no it defintely wouldn't be. Because guys like you used it as a currency BTC is worth as much as it is now. 
You have the cryptocurrency world's thanks.

Even if BTC fails it will keep on bouncing back until it saves the world.
Even if it somehow dies it will reincarnate and past itself on to the next cryptocurrency

I'll give it a try. Never used any apps for cryptocurrency before so this may gain some bias.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:09:52
Jokes on you cryptocurrency, I want it to go down so I can start affording it.
Anyway I can just flip my screen and enjoy going up the rollercoaster again.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:00:48
I needed this joke. Being in love with cryptocurrency is starting to sadden me. 
I know we will see better days but man oh man does the red get me down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:57:32
Its come a long way... its been a wild ride.
holy shit 30k+ people here...
our dreams have come true guys, we did it reddit!

The reason BTC is so successful and will be a revolution is because it is **the beginning of completely digital currency**, not **the end**. 
We're on a path to growth and innovation, advancement in mankind. Just like technology and the personal computer... Bitcoin might be around in the future but I doubt it will be used the same way we use USD now... its a means to an end.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:10:01
LOL... honestly it says something when this looks like the Bitcoin chart.
And BTC will never have inflation like our normal money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:33:02
Rofl, so true its hilarious
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:05:53
Yeah, I think this is the real biggest issue here.
In America no one uses bitcoin because they want all the companies to start accepting and using it.
But since no big companies use it here it hasn't gained mass attraction.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:41:49
Yeah, its been an epic journey getting here.
So many people are mentioning BTC IRL that I used to think would never know it existed.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:52:25
Fuck all those people who kept on saying it would go to 50k or 100k or 1 million and it would be super dumb to sell now, BTC is just beginning and is in its newbie stages hasn't even truly skyrocketed yet and nothing happened or whatever bullshit they pulled out of their asses. Because of listening to them I am down 98% now, lost all my original input.
A million. Lmao, maybe its my fault for being so retarded lol damn. 
Fuck all those posters getting people to buy BTC at 20k hyping it up saying they would be happy to buy in now before it reaches one million, saying that its still super early to buy &amp; they're the early adapters wtf? rofl
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:35:13
Does anyone else have this gut feeling that BTC is gonna do really well next year and breach 10k again? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:50:43
Pretty sure everyone with any interest in crypto wants BTC to get as low as possible, then everyone will start buying the huge dip and the new bottom.
That + Black Friday/Holidays money
When it starts going up... well if it starts going up again, I doubt it will ever be this low for the rest of time.
It will sky rocket, everyone will jump on for the 10k - 20k - 30k bus, and now since *a lot more people are invested in the market &amp; have reasonable stock it can't go down from a few people buying out.*
If it goes down to 1k that would be pretty fair, anyone can afford 1 bit coin. If it goes down to 500 that would be crazy, everybody would be stocking up on them. 2k - 3k can have this affect too, but a lot of people will have to be willing to be the first to invest. Then when it starts increasing to 4k + everyone will want in wishing they invested at 2k.
If this does not happen though, BTC can &amp; will completely die, then it will be replaced by a new main/number one currency in control of the market, most likely Ethereum. It will take people some getting used to, but it will be the only way crypto can survive switching all their support to Eth. It will probably take BTC hitting rock bottom and everyone realizing they were going the wrong way to get everyone to switch to ETH instead.

Rofl wth was that lol. How is this upvoted and why did I upvote this. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:29:24
Never heard of this guy but I don't trust him.
I thought he just made some website where illegal activities were being done and wanted him released but based on the comments here he was some evil bastard who ruined BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:02:02
What's with all these cryptocurrency trackers lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:56:36
Idk, I might get a lot of hate for this but CS can be a very antisocial role and girls are very social creatures. 
Many would be very unhappy in CS.
This can be blamed mainly because of the large time commitments it actually takes to become an expert coder and dish out quality code but if we're being honest I think its just who the woman are and were raised to be.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:48:28
Dang, there's something about hearing a mainstream American guy like John Oliver talk about cryptocurrency like r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:49:34
See you all at $10,000!
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:44:59
Hmm, is it risky? I guess so. But its also the future. In a world like ours digital currency is bound to replace all real money even in the places you consider poorest in the world today. Now, would you rather make under 1% back in interest from a savings account or 3000% back in a couple years?
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:04:52
I hear so many stories about banks closing people's accounts for investing in BTC or even just asking to invest in BTC, denying people loans and debit cards, etc. All kinds of stuff. Its insane really, its like the world doesn't want to adopt BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:28:52
Holy shit what the fuck is going on? I woke up with new inspiration and motivation, ready to change my life, and then I decide to check coinmarketcap again feeling for old times sake feeling invincible and see BTC 8.1K WTF! THE HYPE IS BACK! GET READY FOR OVER 9000 MEMES! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:38:39
Is anyone else nervous about BTC hitting 10k again? Everything is quiet and peaceful for now but when BTC hits 10k there will be news of it everywhere and the masses will start investing again hoping to get in on the profits back to 20k. However with all the hype that came last time, it had unhealthy unnatural growth and the market eventually collapsed. 
I still blame this more on all the alt coins though and it doesn't seem like they'e growing a lot like last time from BTC's growth.
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:42:08
What the heck is going on? I see more people irl into bitcoin now more than ever but the price isn't reflecting it. 
In fact it seems like the price is slowly going down instead, that's so strange
