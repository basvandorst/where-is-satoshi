Its never too late. Buy some today for sure, it won't surprise many even it goes past $5000.
keep on buying in small parts every week, and you should be able to cover yourself with the average price in case it falls.

Its pure speculation. I think everyone's guess here is as good as mine

It won't. Probably it might touch $3750 again which it did today morning, but then again bounced back. Seeing there is so much support at those levels and people are ready to jump guns and buy in full loads, i feel it might not go down to $3500 again.

Well, it can't.  Its a temporary trend and will reverse in few weeks. It has happened all the time during earlier crashes also. This is no different
