Try localbitcoins then. They might have it running there. Ask your friend to transfer btc to you and meet a local for the exchange. Why not asking your friend to just transfer fiat straight to your bank account? That’s probably easier.

I think they’re all waiting for a new ATH. That’s when they’ll buy in massive amounts. Then sell on the way down and cash in billions and billions.

Ask a family member, or go to your embassy. Why ask strangers on the internet for money?

They need to chain that thing to the bedrock.

Definitely not. You won’t see a new ATH before 2020.

The guy set up the most sophisticated drug market in the world and you think he’s gonna get sympathy? You’re delusional.

I’ll buy at $5000

Yes. The 7th in the last 3 months. Can’t wait for the drop so we can have another!

Once the stock market collapses, crypto will follow suit. Bitcoin down to a few hundred dollars, alt coins down to fractions of a cent.
Big money will go into property so wealth stays within those families for a few more generations.
If that money would flood the crypto market after a stock market crash (remember, companies will close down, houses get taken by banks and sold for half the price, businesses sinking) there simply wouldn’t be enough money around for every moon kid + big fish to cash out. Banks will be short of money thanks to every asset in the economy being worth a fraction of what it used to.
I doubt that any money will flow into crypto.

You need machinery, gas, electricity, and human labour in order to get gold. It costs more to mine than bitcoin.

No. Inside is that thing you buy crypto with: paper money. Have you heard of it? Why do you think it’s so massive? It’s Brazil ;) If they had chosen the tiny atm you see in most european countries it would be gone in no time.
