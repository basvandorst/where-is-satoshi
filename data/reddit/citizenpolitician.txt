I can understand that coming from people on the outside of intelligence.  But for those of us that served in the intelligence community, it is EXACTLY  what the NSA et al are up to that makes people like myself, snowden and the people from Synereo want to strike out and **fix** the problem.  
We know what they are up to and we don't like it.

 understand the difference between COINS and ROUNDS.  the US Mint produces and controls COINS which are legal tender. Private companies produce ROUNDS and can be collected, bartered and uses privately in monetary transactions, but cannot be recognized as legal tender.  But this does not prevent their use. 
 The Liberty Dollar got in trouble because A) they used the word Dollar, b) they denominated the coin c) use lady Liberty on the coin, d) they dated the coin and essentially made it too damn close to real money. That gets you in trouble. 
 Private currency exists in many places like casinos, small cities and even strip clubs. These currencies are recognized as such and are accepted as a monetary instrument but cannot be widely circulated.  Circulation requires a physical medium or its not circulated. Bitcoin in not circulated. 
 Commodities qualify as a monetary instrument under US statue and code.  Monetary instruments can be used for financial transactions, private trade and in some instances like US Treasury notes and Bonds, used as legal tender when the Sec of the Treasury approves it. Bitcoin effectively is a commodity. (yes, I understand bit coin is a  Protocol but that only confuses the politicians) 
SO, bitcoin is not coined. Bitcoin is not circulated and bitcoin qualifies as a commodity.  That makes it acceptable as a private monetary instrument. You would think that the US Treasury would not have gone to the lengths they did in making rulings about Bitcoin if they could just claim Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution and be done with it.  
The author ( and as we see too often, our politicians) is a complete idiot.

In simple terms:
* Speculators and risk seekers invest early and drive price up substantially.  
* Investors, hedge funds and the more risk adverse study and learn to understand the real power of bitcoin. 
* Large investors then destroy the value of bitcoin (bear whale, et al) to its most opportunistic position.  
* Next step: controlled regular investment to "get in" without major price swings.  Transactions start going up.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:28:24
Actually no I would not be upset.  That is what happens when you allow greed to drive your investment decisions.  A 25% profit is absolutely fantastic when you compare it to stock based mutual funds or especially bonds.  
The point is you are getting stability at a small cost to volatility in profit and loss.

Securities and Exchange Commission controls the sale of monetized securities in the US.  There are SUBSTANTIAL rules for companies that wish to attract investors and even more rules to actually accept money from investors.  THe biggest rule of all being that you cannot accept money from a non-accredited investor, except under VERY limited circumstances.  Well almost every person that is a part of the project ( including myself ) do not qualify as an accredited investor. Therefore the investment company for Redditisland cannot accept their money without facing substantial fines, penalties and possible jail time.

@_date: 2012-06-01 14:46:52
well, honestly, as the island begins our only really opportunity for a currency is the currency of the host country.  We will have substantial construction going on and shipping happening that will all need to be paid in the currency of that country.  So its possible it will just stay that way.  BUt we also realize that we have the opportunity in the closed environment of the island to do whatever we want.  As much as precious metals fluctuate, I'm still a believer in hard currency and with the fluctuation it really impacts the people that come to the island and exchange their currency. Gold is low, you get a good exchange for your money, gold is high, well you are going to be poorer on the island. on the island itself, it will be stable.  imports would be the issue so we want to be as self-sufficient as possible over time.  
As for the island government, there isn't really going to be one.  It will just develop, but most the people in the group are libertarian leaning or anarchy-capitalist with some more communal minded people.  so I guess the answer is we will see.  But as the island begins, it will be owned by an LLC in which each of the people living on the island are members of the LLC and have voting rights, so initially the government is a corporation.   
@_date: 2012-06-01 20:34:49
Yeah, I think we have decided against that.
@_date: 2012-06-08 11:33:30
the iPad spell checker does that sometime
@_date: 2012-06-08 04:40:05
yeah that was basically it.  its not that we want to control their account or prevent them from spending their money how they see fit.  just as long as we have some means to verify that the money is still there, or that we balance the account based on what remains in the account.
@_date: 2012-08-20 23:58:54
which is exactly what we are doing at redditisland
@_date: 2012-06-01 04:35:24
believe me we have had these discussion.  Such as the LET system, BitCoin, timesharing, hard currency and the current of the country we are in.  Not to mention just making up a new one.  but since the majority of people planning on going to the island are of a very technical nature, bitCoin stood out.  In the end the issue is exchangeability. so just making one up without some backing or something like LET make it very hard to change that currency into standard currency if say, you want to buy tickets off the island.  So  form what i am hearing, its a little of hard currency for investments and saving and BitCoin for day to day retail transactions.  thats doable. 
@_date: 2012-06-01 01:25:47
Of course that is if you believe sea levels are rising?  Plus not all islands are flat. We are looking at islands that have height to the tune of 200 to 1,000 feet so, i think we will be OK.  
@_date: 2012-09-06 19:54:16
Thanks, 
Thats really the kind of answer Im looking for and really why I asked it in the first place.  I WANT to see bitcoin succeed. I want it to endanger other state controlled fiat currencies.  BUt being digital causes particular issues that I think the community needs to address so that the average person can decide to make that switch or at least consider putting some money aside in the bitcoin market.  BUt trust and security seem to be lacking.  
Maybe thats a thread here that people of the community need to address and work out for the industry.  Industry itself right now seems to be more interested in the money they can make being an early provider, than fixing the issues.  I am certainly not up to speed on all that is being done, but I WANT to trust that something is heading in the right direction.  
@_date: 2012-08-21 17:21:47
of course the great thing about Kickstarter is that they are bringing down all these legacy SEC rules and causes a number of changes in investment financing. They actually have new laws being written called the Kickstarter bill.  
@_date: 2012-06-01 18:35:13
thanks, this helps answer our questions. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 19:46:47
And being digital lends it self to considerable more theft that a physical currency. so for acceptance to expand, how is the community going to fix these problems, or should we just wait for someone to just "get it right" when they build a lending/financial management service for bitcoins. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 19:44:50
I guess thats the big point here.  I agree with people that any currency can be stolen such as a bank heist but since bitcoin is digital is seems very susceptible to extensive amount of heists and that would damage its ability to be more prevalent and accepted.  So what you are saying is people are trying to get in on a new "thing" quickly and make a fast buck without considering the consequences and people get ripped off in the end.  
So I guess the question is: is anyone going to do it the right way?
@_date: 2012-06-08 04:43:42
yes i think it would have to be a separate wallet, but we would not limit them in spending their own money, just as long as we can keep the balance up to date for the pledge.  
@_date: 2012-08-21 17:04:57
uugh. you just have to love the iPad spell checker
@_date: 2012-06-01 01:51:02
I appreciate your concern, but I am more interested in the issues dealing with BitCoin.  We can have this conversation over in climate change.  
@_date: 2012-06-01 03:01:36
Ok thanks.  Yeah this is why I wanted to ask this.  Not everyone is going to show up on day 1 and start exchanging cash for BitCoins. but over a period of time as people get their affairs in order, they will be moving to the island and exchanging for whatever the monetary system(s) happen to be available.  THis is a real experiment where a reasonably sized closed (location-wise) community can actually try new technological things.  We fully expect to use devices like our iPhones over wiFi and "bump" exchange financial transactions and other processes like that so a digital currency fits well with that model.  We have the luxury also of just providing hard currency as well but that gets expensive just to manufacture the coins, so...
As for investing in the island, I don't think we would have an issue with BitCoins but the Bank might.  Right now fund raising is processed through an escrow account at the bank so, BitCoin transactions would have to have some similar escrow ability outside the banking process. We do this to ensure trust in the funds collection and that those that are leading this effort aren't just pocketing the money and running off with it.  So if you have a suggestion for how that would work, I am all ears. 
@_date: 2012-06-08 05:30:45
ah very nice.  i think this is the way to do this.  this could really eliminate escrow services all together.

@_date: 2012-06-01 13:07:01
We really aren't making a decision about it except that people have different things they want to do so, in the end it will probably be multiple methods.  The only real issue is exchangeability which is why the discussion centered around something like Bitcoin or hard currency.  After the discussion here it needs to be both.  however,, that doesn't limit people on the island from using other currency methods like the LET System.  But the real appeal of the Bitcoin is the digital nature of the currency.  It fits in well with the type of people going to the island the and means by which we can manage our economical interactions through modern technological devices.  
@_date: 2012-08-21 04:32:11
1. yup, your right, there is only a few hundred truly active and dedicated people out of the 5,000.  but thats a start.  and, no, we have many people committing money. its way bigger than most kickstarter programs.  
2.  always hard to do but the committee is coming together and now we are assigning roles
3. nothing gets done in a legal since until we reform the company in the host nation where we will purchase land, OUTSIDE the jurisdiction of the USA and the SEC.

Unfortunate your arguments are getting tiring and I will have to end it on this note.  Yes I have spent time living in tropical islands and its a great place filled with usually great and happy people.  
BUT, as for the land stealing, you see, in most pacific island nations its ILLEGAL for foreigner to OWN the LAND. we can only LEASE it and pay lease payments to the ACTUAL INDIGENOUS land owners for 75 to 99 years.  Very little island property is actually freehold and that is typically a small fraction of land ( 8% in Fiji, 0% in Vanuatu) so please go away.

@_date: 2012-06-08 11:35:57
thats really about it.  we just want to verify that AN account, owned by someone who is a member of our group, has money put aside in the account and we can verify the balance of that account.  we will use that balance as the amount of money they have committed to the redditisland project.
@_date: 2012-08-21 14:38:41


BINGO! exactly what we are trying to do but in an area of the world that is looking, no begging for new answers and looking for ways to participate globally through foreign investment.  WE aren't forcing them.  THEY are asking us.  Again, except for Chile, these countries of which only Vanuatu is really Third World, are looking to expand their foreign exports and build a stronger global economic presence.  Mauritius is building an entire High Tech Free Trade Zone City.  Vanuatu and Fiji are offering enumerable tax and business incentives to drive foreign investment to THEIR country.  We are not invading, we are being invited.  
Im sorry you are angry about the past.  The 18th and 19th century were not kinds to disadvantaged nations.  But its the 21st century, with globalization, mostly free movement of peoples, immediate communications and knowledge.  These countries you so desperately what to protect, dont seem to want your protection. They want to be a part of the world at large and be improved because of it.  
But there are places in the world that do need or want protection from the outside and THEY get it.  Look at the un-contacted tribes of the Amazon or the Sentinel Island people of the indian ocean.  No one visits them and the host nations try to protect their desires and wants. Its time to get with the world and forget the suffrage of  the past.  
@_date: 2012-06-02 00:06:35
Yup, the information given here has been very helpful.  Im sure the island will be a combination of a number of monetary systems but I still suspect Bitcoin will probably end up being the favored transaction currency with a whole lot less initial deposits than what I was referring to originally.

we don't want to live on gilligans island either.  there will be infrastructure. roads. water retention and management, some form of sanitation, although that will mostly be through septic systems, island wide wifi, eventually cellular service, etc...
@_date: 2012-08-20 23:58:07
Well first let me say, hello and i have no intentions of taking anything away from anyone who wants to pursue their own ambitions, so i apologize if i sounded a little surprised.  
Obviously, I would prefer to work together on a common goal, but feel free to go about your own business.  As for Bitcoins, the vast majority of the redditisland community is set on a free market economy that operates as free as possible and as separate from government as possible.  We dont intend to impose any kind of restrictions on trade or currency for those that immigrate to redditisland. but to do so also means we need a very free market based host nation.  We have that pretty much narrowed down so we think its very doable to have a currency like bitcoin be a factor. 
So yes, we will set it up so that we can take bitcoins.  It is discussed in the fundraising guide on the subreddit.  But as of right now we are not taking physical possession of any currency or capital because we are not at a stage where we can deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules governing investment for a corporation.  We cant afford to run afoul of that.  
However, when we actually get around to buying the island, we will have our bitcoin account setup and people will be allowed to use bitcoins for investment.  This will only happen AFTER the company reforms as a new corporation in the host nation where we plan to operate so that we can stay out of the eyes of the SEC as much as possible. 
I will tell you that the process of raising money for a project like this is not as easy as just setting up a bitcoin address. There are large problems with transparency since people do not want to be ripped off ( kind of like Pon-z) and they want to know what will happen to the money invested.  Not to mention that an investment entails the sale of securities to the investor so the transaction is not private, it is recorded legally in the corporation's records.  
I am more than happy to work with you on how best we can incorporate bitcoins into the investment process and into the island economy should you choose to do that.  
@_date: 2012-06-08 05:18:09
I read about assurance contracts on the Bitcoin wiki.  Is that possible on the Bitcoin network yet?
@_date: 2012-08-21 13:20:59
who said anything about colonizing?  We are not showing up with guns and manifest destiny as our guide. We are not demanding or forcing anyone to move or get out of our way.  
We are migrating and immigrating INTO the culture and heritage of the host nation.  We are bringing our skills and talents, our technology and economy  and becoming a part of the success of the country by being a part of THEM. 
Honestly, Chile and Mauritius are already just as much in line with who we are and so we dont even really offer anything new to them that they dont already have.  As for places like Vanuatu, well they are DESPERATE to expand their economy and exports from Corpa into other industries, particular service industries.  We provide a ready made solution for THEIR desires.  This is a mutually beneficial relationship, not a take over. 
@_date: 2012-06-01 04:31:33
OK, so this more or less solve the issue between the two camps the argue over digital or Hard currency.  the answer is both for their respective purposes.  that will go along way to helping things move along.

nope, buying and island. 
@_date: 2012-06-01 03:07:12
OK. well more than likely it would not be all at once but it would probably happen over the course of a year or so.  Of course once the majority of people have arrived on the island those transactions would become negligible 
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:44:23
I know it might sound that way but i am open to suggestions for making look less like a scam. I really would like to do this, not to just makes some bitcoin but for the fun of actually doing it.

NO it just changed they way in which their greed was directed.  And now they have the power of government to impose rules that help to set up loop holes and backdoors for greed to occur but in a "legal" way, hidden from the consumer. 
The best regulation in the world is an informed and active consumer.  Companies can go bankrupt overnight if an informed consumer can show bad behavior or illegal business practices and get the consumers to react.  
Case in point, what collapsed ENRON?  They regulations? Absolutely Not. It was the investors in ENROn who started to see activities they did not want to be a part of and they started to take their money out of ENRON, which caused their shell game to collapse and expose to everyone what they had been up to.  **THEN** the regulations were used to legal proceedings.  THe regs in no way *caught* ENRON, the consumer/investor did.  
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:03:04
So no matter what, it will require a third party to act as an escrow of the funds until the conditions are met.  And from my reading so far on this subreddit, I haven't seen any Bitcoin escrow companies. Do you happen to know of a bitcoin escrow or might you provide your opinion on how best to engage a third party in the transaction or provide a company name that might be able to act as a third party.  
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:48:22
banking can deal in any currency including gold and silver or other commodity and can run a proper trustworthy operation that protects the investments you make in their operation as long as the people involved are of course trustworthy as well.  When done on  small local scale where  people know everyone, its difficult to cheat people.  That would get known very quick and the bank would fail very quick.  A bank is a service company like any other company and must provide good service to its clients or they will leave.  just like any other company.  
But when banks get too big and too big to fail and deeply embedded with the government, then you have real problems.  And that is unfortunately the majority of what we have today.  
Most local banks didnt get or take TARP funds.  They didnt fail or have a financial crisis.  they were more or less stable and continued.  Not so the big banks who recklessly and illegally in my opinion misused and abused their clients and the american people.  
Thats why you need to differentiate.  
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:39:29
I was thinking about this the other day.  What if.....
* People open an account at the bank in Fiat but that bank offers the service of reflecting this account in BTC. 
* The bank operates ( not as part of the bank but a wholly owned subsidiary or the like)  a transactional exchange allowing account holders to place BTC onto the exchange for sale through the bank account.  
* The people with the bank account, which has a BTC Key attached to it, also have a private wallet with a key.  
* the purchase of BTC is always to the private wallet key 
* So from the Bank's perspective, account holders make Fiat deposits or BTC deposits from the account holder's private wallet.  THe bank can track this transaction.  The BTC placed on the exchange from the account holder is also tracked and recorded.  But the exchange always does the purchase to the private wallet.  
* So the bank NEVER sees BTC transactions going INTO the bank between account holders or people on the exchange, only transactions coming into and out of a single account holders account which are fully tracked.  
* Oh one other note.  There is no exchange escrow so no exchange bank account.  The BTC for sale is held in the seller's account until the exchange determines a buyer.  Then the money is transferred in BTC to the exchange which immediately transfers it to the Private wallet.  Exchange transaction fees are removed from the seller's account prior to being transferred to the exchange.  Exchange transaction fees go to the bank itself. 
Would this comply with banking regulations since the commodity transaction is tracked from the banks point of view up until it is placed on the exchange and no incoming transaction to the account holder is ever processed by the bank? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:13:16
The best bank would be a transactional/voluntary investment bank.  Your savings/checking accounts are secure with no fractional reserve placed on them.  They are there in total minus the month changes for maintaining and protecting the account.  
The voluntary side is that I want to put some of my money into a bank investment account.  I know up front its an investment, has risk and is subject to fractionalization to create investment dollars into mortgages, annuities, commodities and other business investments.  This money could be lost.  
But the savings and Checking are always there no matter what.  
I would drop every dollar/BTC i have into **THAT** bank tomorrow.
