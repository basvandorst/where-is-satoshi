Can someone post this, i don't have a facebook account
"However, over the past months, Bitcoins started to be actively traded on the market against real currencies."
wrong just as an example in july 2011 btc was 31usd
"This means that Bitcoins could be exchanged against U.S. dollars. Until November 13, its value was not higher than ten dollars. "
april 2013 btc was 266usd
"There is no doubt that some forces have decided to manipulate the recent value of the Bitcoin to an average of $1,000."
You have 0 evidence, it definitely goes trough hype cycles regularly but never below where it started
"Gold has an intrinsic mineral and material value that is being used as well in the souks of the Arab world or by women in India"
Do you know what intrinsic means? It's beauty is based on perception.
the instrinsic value of gold is usage in computer parts as it is a good conductor( it will give it 1/100 value of the 1262usd/ounce)
"There is absolutely no economic, financial or social value to the Bitcoin."
Surely the ability to send value of100million usd to the other part of the world instantly with 0 fees has no meaning. (there are tens of other reasons bitcoin is useful microtransactions, the most secure payment system  if you know what you are doing there is no risk of stolen identity etc)

Or they simply do what they know best , making the best mining equipment and selling it for profit. They don't need to bother considering how much money is being thrown at them.
     What is true is that all companies who make mining rigs have to sell a lot of bitcoin from pre-orders to make them, most of the big ones sell off-exchange.

Offtopic: I find MP to be one of the oddest man involved in bitcoin from a long time ago.

@_date: 2014-02-05 02:32:16
There is no reason why BIG VOLUME traders would be spread in a distributed matter, they will always pool in the same place.
Maybe an example would better. If an exchange(A) with 300k in volume states that they will be closing so funds should be moved. If there would be 2 alternative exchange(b) and exchange(C) the volume from those big traders will not be split 50%-50% but something like 90%-10%. liquidity attracts liquidity
and another point about the traffic is the relative price stability. Google trends is proof that during big swings in price traffic follows.
EDIT: nice downvotes, i guess I should feel bad for not joining the circlejerk of yelling price/volume manipulation around gox/huobi.(or maybe my writing style is too rude for reddit)
My point is traffic could go down 50% in a day without harming the volume in a noticeable manner as long as the people who actually make a living(or part time) from trading will be there. Simple people who want to buy in or sellers(miners etc) don't create a big portion of the volume even if they are the majority of the trafic.

It is mostly my assumption and it's based on how many blockchain.info wallets that got hacked used dropbox for backups.  I would not upload any kind of sensitive info on any storage site but if i really have to, I make sure no one besides me can ever have access to what is inside and truecrypt is the best tool for that.

It doesn't mean anything. 
Most of the volume on any market is made from big day traders(includes bots)
So if btcchina stops being the best choice and houbi is an alternative it's not necessary for a large number of people to move in order to have a significant impact on the volume.
I don't know how many but probably less than 1000 and more than 20 would be enough to shift the volume from one exchange to another.
It was a natural move considering houbi provides what they needed 0% fees and other traders use them(liquidity).

You should spend more time reading up on how wallets,transactions work. Keep them in coinbase and use 2fa until you are sure you can keep your computer secure and know how to avoid losing your private keys.
What is bitcoin.info? if you meant blockchain.info/wallet then check if the btc left from that address.

What a fucking stupid argument born in the reddit echo chamber.
The 1 million btc figure of satoshi's wealth is based on mental gymnastics there is 0 hard proof that they belong to him or that he kept the private keys.
Ever wondered why 21 mil? Maybe because he knew he would throw away 1 mil so that will leave a nice round figure of 20 mil. 
Also, there is no early adopter bias.

As long as there is connection between banks and businesses you need their fucking approval. Why do you think there are so few companies in the US?!?! Because banks dont want to take any risk and even if you don't hold customers USD they will still deny you just because they CAN.
