mBTC should be named "Bitcoin", and one Bitcoin should just be 1000 mBTC. Two mBTC is roughly $1 today.
@_date: 2016-08-27 17:20:50
I agree with you, but the main currency unit must be called "Bitcoin" if mainstream adoption should happen. Nobody knows what a Satoshi is or how it relates to Bitcoin. And it sounds rather exotic as well. 
I think we will use bits in the future, but people will call it Bitcoins anyway.

What happens with people who have all of their cash in funds and stocks when hyperinflation hits? Surely the stocks will ride the wave along with it, no?
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:27:27
Changetip brought me into the cryptocurrency world. I am sure I am not the only one. They have done their part in the struggle for Bitcoin mass-adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:37:26
Nope. Peer to peer is the only way. Read the Bitcoin white paper.

You don't need to buy from the black market. And if you use a crypto address that is remotely close to one of his black market addresses, then Coinbase will freeze your funds and ban you from their platform. So don't do any transactions to/from Coinbase with one of those "tainted" addresses.

The market needs to mature first. But you can even now reach out and ask retailers or people if they are willing to sell their shit for cryptos. I bet there is at least one person on the planet willing to sell you stuff for cryptos.

How are the miners involved in the transactions in LN? Or maybe they aren't? I thought miners secured the transactions.

In fiat I hope, not in Bitcoin. Don't spam the network with your peasant money.

Coinbase ≠ cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:42:38
Fiat is government property. You touch their property, they have a right to cavity search you. 
Here's a little secret if you want to avoid government; don't cash out to fiat. Buy goods and services directly in crypto, p2p. That was the reason Bitcoin was invented. Real financial freedom. Like cash, but instant and global.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:14:53
The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent; they can see everything you do, and track you long into the future. They can check your transactions retro actively and black list you even after you stopped using their service. They use special software and third parties to analyze the blockchain.

Alright, let's make a public service announcement instructing people to not spam the network. Problem solved.
If it's that easy to abuse and bring down a product, by simply using it, then it's not a good product. Imagine if Visa or Mastercard were constantly out and about, whining and bitching that their customers were not using their cards correctly and slowing down the network. People wouldn't turn to the users, but rather to the companies to do something about it.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:12:38
This is indeed a worrying trend. Soon $100 will buy 0.000 BTC.

Start by reading white papers, and read up on words and terms that you don't understand. You don't need to understand everything, but at least enough to know what the project is trying to achieve, and how it will achieve its goals. Then you'd want to read the discussion on forums, such as reddit, and try to see if people thinks its goals are realistic and get the general mood of its investors. That's enough to get you started.

I didn't mention a single crypto currency, other than Bitcoin. 
Do you think Bitcoin is the pinnacle of technology in the crypto space? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:44:34
It's not too late, but there are better investments. Bitcoin, I think, will reach $400k in 10 years, if it's still alive. You'll see far better returns with other cryptocurrencies though. Many other projects are running circles around Bitcoin, tech-wise. Do your research and you will be heavily rewarded.

It was unlikely that NetScape would lose its place as the king of browsers, back in the days. I think Bitcoin has run its race.

Yea, Core is developing something called the "Lightning Network" and "Segregated Witness", which aims to "fix" Bitcoin. The community is split in regards to whether or not these implementations are good for Bitcoin. On this sub, most seem to be for it, but on people are mostly against it and suggests other solutions.

It creates heat when you light it on fire. You could also wipe your ass with it. Extremely overvalued IMO, because you could buy normal toiletpaper and achieve pretty much the same for a lot less cryptos. I don't get it.

Why are you so bent on trading cryptos? You are a brand-new newbie. You have zero experience. Holding is the best strategy for you, and that's best done out of the exchanges.

The total market cap will remain the same, but the number of coins in circulation will double. But it's wrong to assume that both forks are "Bitcoin". One will be Bitcoin, and the other will be a new coin.

Give it a couple of weeks and you'll get your money back. Also, don't store your cryptos on an exchange out of all places. Use this time now to study and research. Google on how to make paper/offline wallets. Figure out a plan what to do about your situation if you don't get the money back. In other words, use this time now to cover all bases.

Yea, but you see, Satoshi didn't really understand what he wanted when he made Bitcoin. Bitcoin is better as a store of value - "digital gold" - and not as a P2P cash system. You don't go and buy coffee with a pound of gold, do you??

More and more companies are switching to other cryptos for their every day transactions to save money. If the trend continue this way, then Bitcoin will just be a speculative asset. It can certainly be used as just a store of value, but for its own survival, btc must be available for every day transactions in order to not scare away newbies.

No, but gold has properties that makes it useful in other areas, for example in electronics. Gold isn't only used as a store of value or as a currency. Bitcoin has only one area of application, which is being a currency of the internet. A Bitcoin is just a number on the blockchain, it can't be used for anything else.
