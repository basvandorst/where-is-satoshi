I don't believe Adam is still associated  with VOS. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:11:09
They do.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:31:43
Amazing. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:25:46
Mine too... Should we form a line or something?
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:15:49
Wow! Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:27:27
I'd love some bits!

Exactly this. Bought primes, made roi, Bought a bunch of solos, and than, zen shut down.

Drained my dogetipbot wallet, so instead of reloading something I don't use! I just gave my first Changetip, once it was set up it was crazy easy!

Ha, and there is still people defending him on hash talk. I'm glad I sold all my primes for $55-60 and all my paycoin as soon as it was converted. I've still got 15 mh/s in solos and 45mh/s in Genesis that I couldn't sell. But I've made roi already, and am going to try to do a charge back on my cc as they broke the contract of "always up, always profitable" which didn't seem to have any outs for them. 
I sure feel bad for the people on the leader board. That's a lot of money down the drain.

Well with Vos closing, what's the best way for a Canadian to sell Btc? I can still buy on Cryptsy, but I can't sell for CAD.

It was finally the kick I needed. I have been gradually getting out for a few months now, but I've sold what was left of my xpy, and put all my remaining miners up. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:11:34
Yeah same, it's only two stakers, so in the end, not a huge loss, just keep selling the coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:42:03
I will thank you! 
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:02:00
You can trade it on Cryptsy and a few other real(non Gaw) exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:58:52
Same!
