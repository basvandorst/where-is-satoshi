My comment is textbook irrational because??? 
1. They will find more bitcoins in a mine in California?
2. People will stop noticing a far superior tool and becoming users of it?

You should. Valuation does not a bubble make :-)

Increasing values with rational price drivers like limited supply and increasing adoption do not meet the irrationality standard a bubble needs. 
With Bitcoin supply at 21 million and the world's supply of millionaires measured in US$ at roughly roughly 35 million, they could all stand in a line and offer all of their worldly possessions for a coin and they couldn't each have one. Scarcity and adoption my friend, scarcity and adoption. Just Hodl.

Bitcoin, the end of money is a good watch.

Bitcoin blockchain analysis means that bitcoins can be tainted by previous illegal use. Monero is like dealing in cash as it is anonymous and keeps no unencrypted record of transactions.

Obviously. About $250 a coin right now. It's the only fungible coin and won't stay in the 2% of BTC range forever.

Bubble bullshit. A limited supply with ever increasing user adoption may look like one. A bubble requires irrational exuberance and there's nothing irrational about bitcoins continuing price rise. At US$1M it wouldn't be a bubble, it would still be a bargain.

Exactly and one day the bit will reach dollar parity so it's on sale now :-)

Lol. Dash! You're funny.

I didn't think or say it has no reason to fail. I simply pointed out that it doesn't meet the definition of a bubble. Do you disagree with my specific assertion?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:57:51
Ahh, cool.

Yeh, for instance Monero is adapting again control by implementing I2P with their Kovri C++ implementation so that state agencies can't even see the transaction happen as well as not being able to see what the the transaction contains.

Unless you care about the principle of code is law.
