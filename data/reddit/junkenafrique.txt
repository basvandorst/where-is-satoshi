The code is widely available and well written. Each modification to the code is very easy to follow, since there is a trail of all commits (standard git stuff).
Putting in backdoors would be nearly impossible to do. The code base for bitcoin is quite small, consise, and well designed, which makes it easy to read.
There are many things to worry about with bitcoin, but there is not much to worry about with the code.

Hi Friendizi
From my understanding of Bitcoin, the bitcoins are lost forever.
Someone my attempt by brute force (until the current encryption is cracked) to generate bitcoin addresses and hope for a collision with an existing address having bitcoins, but it is a pointless exercice to do: mining is millions and millions time more profitable.
The bitcoin address space is so huge, there is not much of a point going fishing for lost wallets.
Also, since it is possible to change the crypto algorithms over time (bitcoin was designed with evolution of the algos in mind), the lost wallets that are in existence mostly have small value, except for a very few early bitcoin users who grew huge wallets and lost interest (or lost their wallets due to bugs in the early clients). Digging for these wallets is a waste of time and energy, unless some very smart guy has good clues on how to recover the wallets.
Hope that answers your question.

Since cornering a market involves trapping short sellers, which involves the existence and the wide spread use of derivatives, I think we will get there the the day Bitcoin economy will have grown to the point where there are more "paper bitcoins" than "solid bitcoins". Then we will all rant about that corrupted bitcoin economy, and dream about the good old days. This is what will happen.

Bitcoin is an awesome experiment. Many economists are calling for the Bitcoin deflationist spiral, but I don't think it will ever occur.
Let's say people start hoarding, and deflation kicks in. The natural response to this is that some people will stop believing in Bitcoin and sell their bitcoins, or liquidate them by buying stuff. This is a kickback that stops the deflationist spiral.
I find it funny that many economists think bitcoin has no future because it is intrisically deflationistic... I would love to have and use a currency that actually keeps and even improve my buying power over time. I am sure everyone else does.

Ever heard of robohash? It is a similar concept

Search github.com for "bitcoin arbitrage". Other people are already doing it. The problems come when multiple people are arbitraging at the same time over the same markets. It increases the risk, and eats away all profits. You then need to be the quickest arbitrager, which is not an easy thing to do.

The gst is 5% of the 1.50%
Gst ends up taking 0.075% of the transaction
