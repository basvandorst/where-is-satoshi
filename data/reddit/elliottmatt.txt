Nothing wrong with LN, but we need bigger blocks in the meantime to keep fees down!

I'll give you props for the write up.
I'm fine if we have different viewpoints. I'm not a litecoin fan but see why some people may like it. I have btc and bch, about 6x bch than btc though. I want them both to do well. Better to diversify to not lose your shirt if one goes belly up! 
We will just see how the rest of the year/next couple years plays out.

Again, while that may temporarily improve stuff, I don't think you understand what "soft-fork" means. It means "pretty please!".
LN will need to have bigger blocks to continue to scale. In 2018 we have the computing power and network to handle 2, 4, or 8 MB blocks. Why not do it and prep for the future?

Dogecoin was designed as a joke currency and hasn't had any software updates in two years.
Bch has four independent development teams working on protocol compatible clients.
I'll be honest I don't know a lot about doge because I don't care or own any of it. I just know that the level of friction required for a company or service to swap between btc and bch is next to nothing since they are 99.9% the same. When being so similar, the one with lower fees and faster times is going to look mighty appealing.

Lol. How do you do the remind me thing again?

So I'm not going to link to any specific places bc I'm on mobile now, but prior to 2017 Bitcoin had very few fees per transaction bc the block weren't full. Since the demand of transactions has outpaced the blocksize, the Bitcoin core development team has pushed multiple technologies such as segwit and now lightning networks that will "eventually" drive the cost of transactions back down. Will they? Maybe someday. Segwit is active now, and lightning may someday, but if these technologies are going to be ready soon, then why not just do a blocksize doubling to 2MB to keep fees down?

If you are new then you should look back at blocksize and fees. If lightning network is right around the corner, then why not double blocksize to 2MB until it's ready to absorb the demand so fees don't go crazy?

Bitcoin is much slower than most competing chains. Eth is targeting 15 seconds while litecoin is at 2.5 minutes and Bitcoin is at 10 minutes. Doubling the size of the block would have a tiny fraction of a percent change in distributing that block, so no, there would be a near zero impact on that. Modern internet speeds can download a block in a second or two, so doubling to even 4-5 seconds out of 10 minutes is still a tiny tiny percentage. Does that help/make sense?

Can we talk about how it says this in the white paper? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:42:33
I can understand that stuff evolves.
Where is the current vision then? 
Is there a place to learn how and why Bitcoin stopped becoming peer to peer cash and more of an asset class/store of value?
