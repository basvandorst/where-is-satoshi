I think a Canadian company makes the notes for all three countries so it doesn't seem that far fetched to me.

"Minimum quantity for "Prospero X-1 (100Ghash/second)" is 10."
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:26:38
do you have a name or do you simply mean people will sell them used?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:49:40
i posted an update see below.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:35:40
i found it on blockchain [here]( Not sure why it's still unconfirmed. At least it hasn't disappeared into the ether. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:07:26
i was just excited that i could actually afford a miner... i guess i posted that a little prematurely .... but that never happens to me, i swear.
