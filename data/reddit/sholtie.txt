Because often bank transfers to fiat in Korean exchanges (which is what I assume you are referencing), banks dont often Sepa transfer from. You often cant intertrade cryptos as they are all equivalently at a premium on these exchanges.

What is this "Stock Market" of which you speak.

You seem angry. I just wanted to let you know... I ... I ...
I love you.

About 3-4 days at the moment for me. But yeah I get nervous everytime I have to withdraw. I have this really weird insolvency paranoia constantly flying around in my head about the whole thing.

Yeah apparently thats what they claim to be able to do... but again I have zero experience with them and am not about to randomly trust a payment company without info first.

Do people not know this is where the money is at right now?

Thanks so much for the advice, I really appreciate it! Yeah it's tough to know when I haven't heard of these companies before!

Man, if I could do it it would be amazing! But again, Im not dumping my funds into an payment scheme I dont know a lot about. Even if it means I could exploit it 10x more.

I honestly dont even care if it takes my 3 hours to get my money through at this stage. The fact that its there "on hold" sporadically and with no issues in the past has me seriously suspicious. 
Got me feeling that Mt Gox Feels....

Some might even say this is good for Bitcoin.

Investing in bitcoin is like dating the nerdy girl in school because you can see in 10 years she is she's gonna get super hot, but your ugly ass will already have her on lock before she is way out of your league.
