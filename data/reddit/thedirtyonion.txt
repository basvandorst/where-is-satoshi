It doesn't matter if it regains its value, the volitility needs to decrease in order to facilitate more widespread adoption.

Why are you comparing equity markets to a supposed currency?  Equities are supposed to be risky assets, currencies are not.  Despite Russia being on the verge of severe economic sanctions and a potential military conflict, the ruble only fell a few percentage points.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin seems to go up and down by 25% or more every month.  
You might be right about Bitcoin regaining all of the value lost from the MtGox issues in the next few months, but until the volitility decreases significantly many businesses will refain from accepting it as payment.  Even if they are able to convert relatively easily to fiat, many just won't want any expose to FX risk even if for a short timeframe.

You elect the politicians that put keep laws in place.  Why should they be blamed for enforcing the laws that elected officials enact?

I'm pretty sure it is because he was running a drug bazaar and commiting numerous felonies in doing so.  I'm not sure it is fair to call prosecuters bullies for enforcing the law, pretty sure that is just doing their jobs....

That might be illegal.  Also, there are almost 2 million people in WV - how much money do you think your fund would raise?  Would people really change their vote for a dollar?  Two dollars?

There are a number of asset classes that traditionally serve as safe harbors (gold, RE, etc.).  Why hold cryptos as a hedge against fiat currencies losing value when you can hold those other assets?  Cryptos carry a huge political/regulatory risk, while things like metals do not.

That is a huge assumption.  Already down 2.7% from that level in only 4 hours.....
Edit: LOL

If this was true then there should be a way to value bitcoin.  I have not really seen any good valuation analysis.  If people can't determine bitcoins value then it doesn't really have value....

The problem is global QE has made almost everything overpriced.  Real estate is overpriced because people can get low interest mortgages to finance purchases.  Bonds are overpriced because central banks are buying them directly.  Stocks are overpriced because people have been crowded out of bonds and are buying stocks to get yield.  There isn't much out there that isn't in a bubble, so bitcoin is a pretty good place to hide.

Yeah, imagine you are a Japanese person with some money to invest.  Would you rather put it in (i) a government bond, yielding a negative (!!!) interest rate, (ii) stocks, which are in a bubble and have a P/R ratio over 25 and yield like 1.5%, or (iii) bitcoin, which is the one asset class the government cannot directly devalue?

As long as central banks keep devaluing other currencies and China keeps currency controls in place there really is no reason for the value to stop rising.  There is a finite amount of bitcoin in the world, while central banks print another $200 billion of currency every month.  This rally is not really that shocking..

There is also the possibility that the debt fueled bubble caused by years of QE finally bursts, which would result in massive write-downs.  Write-downs = destruction of cash, which could result in USD spiking relative to Bitcoin.  This is particularly true since the dollar is often viewed as a safe haven in times of crises.

Basically 100%.  More a question of when rather than if.  I'd still stick with bitcoin long term though as the only realistic way for governments to deal with their debt problems is to either deal with a massive depression like Greece has gone through or inflate it away.  Politicians will definitely opt to go the inflation route.   
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:50:26
Of course.  Yellen's statement essentially said the Fed may keep eroding the value of the dollar because they have no idea why inflation isn't increasing (it turns out handing trillions of dollars to the people that are least likely to spend additional income doesn't actually stimulate the economy much, who would have thought?).  Cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin in particular, are a direct beneficiary because they are designed to be largely non-inflationary.
