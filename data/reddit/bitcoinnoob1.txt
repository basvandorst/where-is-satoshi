I was under the impression that Bitcoin was not premined and everyone had the same chance?

Will do doing a few different versions, and hopefully one for mobiles soon :)

Will check now, thanks!

Updated the code so now the user has to only copy 5-6 lines of code, compared to the 3500 plus chars they had to before.
We also now have a designer on the team, so cool things coming soon!

DDosing the big pool websites to get the message across is the only thing I can see that would do anything :/ P2P pools are needed

Fair enough :) The sites a day old so I must do the instructions page etc and get it functional before tidying it up. I see it more as a project than a business, Its free to use and I have a gazillion other projects :)

Thank you

I know, but even if every human send 100 transactions a day by then the hardware will still get faster and faster until every transaction will be processed for no fee as anyone could buy a 2nd hand miner for basically nothing so every single transaction will be processed in no time and for free. It will just take some time, the question is will a 51% attack screw it all up before then as competition and cost takes the power from the masses and puts it into the hands of the few :/

I'l look into it thanks :) Yeah people are right to be worried about malware with their cryptos since it is real money :)

How about an option on the donation form for sending an email to the person? When sending coins you can add a label, unsure of if this is what you meant :)

Not quite :) I'l have the instructions page up soon. This version is just for people that have websites and can edit the page of their website. I do plan on making a few different versions for different purposes so hold on :)

But it could be evenly spread out based on the countries economic development. It might give lower countries people the option of removing their support

I mean that the newest gear wont be making them a profit so the lower end gear guys will find it effective to start up again. The hash rate should then stay the same so the difficulty will be the same. I dont really seeing the rate going down as it will have old 'unprofitable' equipment become profitable again

Would a button beside the copy button called "Display QR" that pops up a QR code be good since I want to try and keep the form small and tidy?
@_date: 2014-01-18 13:24:05
Thanks will update now! - Done
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:24:59
Yeah I'l be making it so it will work on mobiles and be easier to use and understand. Thanks for the feedback!

But couldn't the same thing be said about gold? If you have faith in its future worth then you can take the extra risk and go for it? If the media was interested for some reason at that stage then people might buy loads for greed and not because they believe in it

Thank you!!

I know its not the same, just assumed they we tricking their users in someway :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:35:12
I meant people need to wake up and transfer to these
