The goal will be reached when everything is priced in satoshis.
@_date: 2019-11-09 12:51:43
You don't need one, you can just use a LN-enabled wallet. I recommend Breez (both Android and iOS).
Otherwise feel free to pass the satoshis along.

In some markets many people may prioritize fees, but in places where the government is trying to fight bitcoin, availability and privacy are much more important.

Yes, someone spent a shitton of money to scare people away from bitcoin. It was pretty obvious at the time. We can't know for sure who that was, maybe even more than one actor. These were vulnerable times.
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:00:22
I've introduced a few people directly to LN recently (Breez) and surprisingly it was much easier than an on-chain wallet. Breez really makes things easy.
Previously, two things I found really difficult for people to understand is 1. why a transaction takes a seemingly random amount of time to confirm; 2. how to determine a fee rate. LN completely eliminates these issues. Yes, there is a risk of a routing issue, but it's relatively easy to grasp.
I point them to bitrefill for their first purchase. Breez also has an option to move satoshis between the chain and the channel. The only downside is they still open only a 1M SAT channel with no option to upgrade.

Whenever I exchange contact details I'll send a "hi" message right away so that the other person has a trace of our conversation later.
Since the "hi" message was the day before or earlier and get no reply and then it went straight to business, it seems like OP is doing the same thing.

That's why you buy bitcoin *before* shit hits the fan.
If enough people in your area have bitcoin already you can provide a service in exchange for it. We're not there yet though...

I love the idea, but utility tokens are a major pita... Could be much more successful as a sidechain.

Be patient my friend. The day will come.
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:10:59
Current infrastructure cannot handle rapid scaling yet. LN is in its early stages, there are only a few decent wallets and they're still too "raw" for an average user. On-chain fees would skyrocket if we started immortalizing our "coffee" purchases.
Steady growth is better for the network and the ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:45:06
Governments don't do things for the benefit of society. They're gonna fight to death anything that makes us less dependent on them. Cash is going away within a decade or two, bitcoin is gonna be the only way to truly own your money.

It's probably even more difficult to pay for McDonald's with gold. It doesn't make it gold's problem.
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:04:35
Yes. Some part of the community wants to build a payment system on top of Bitcoin. Other parts are just happy it's the best store of value our civilization has come up with (in terms of properties, not liquidity). Neither defines what Bitcoin's goals are.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:18:59
I don't get people who go all in or all out in one shot. DCA is the way to go both ways.
Better yet, use bitcoin as your savings account and hold only enough fiat to cover 6-12 months of expenses.
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:04:55
I didn't say there weren't, I said they can't do it safely, as in they had to sacrifice other properties (like auditability) in order to do so.

Educate people on how fiat money works and how bitcoin fixes that.
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:08:49
Well, there's the transaction fees, which are not significant now, but will most likely increases over the next several years.
And they likely meant 20% hashrate, just poor journalism...
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:58:45
Yes I have. One solution increases tx size and verification time and allows for hidden inflation in case of a bug. Another solution is more verifiable, but hugely increases tx size and verification time. There are no (known) solutions that would not have a big negative impact otherwise.
I hope we get schnorr signatures within a year or so, this would allow for some safe privacy improvements among other nifty things.
For now, chaumian coinjoin and Lightning Network are probably the best choices for privacy.

I'd like to know that as well. I prefer to donate small amounts on a regular basis and keep it as private as possible.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:26:24
Don't expect big changes overnight, the move towards privacy is gonna be a decade long process.
Just a few years ago nobody cared about chat encryption, now Telegram, Signal, etc have huge user bases. Protonmail has had a great growth too.
It's happening, be patient.

Exactly! The whales can only wreak havoc for so long. Fundamentals are solid, more and more people actually *use* bitcoin every day. It's only a matter of time...

Recently Winnie the Pooh, but generally there's no such thing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:57:18
Also even if you're offline for a long time it doesn't automatically make you lose money. The other party needs to actively attempt to steal your money and risk losing their money if they're caught in the act.

Neither is bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-15 01:03:03
They don't define bitcoin's goals more than jewellers define gold's goals.
Only acting people can have goals, both as individuals and groups/organizations. Bitcoin is neither.
Don't get me wrong, I myself work full time on making LN happen at a large scale, but saying it's "bitcoin's goal" is misguided and incorrect. Bitcoin is a network/asset that makes it possible for orgs like ours to have a goal of bringing a payment system based on hard money back into the economy. Bitcoin itself is an inanimate concept with no goals, it already does what it's supposed to do.
@_date: 2019-10-14 20:52:48
Bitcoin CEO told you?
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:36:49
That would be perfect, but as far as I know there's no safe way to do that yet. But I'm positive we'll get there one way or another.
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:34:56
That's why you don't give custody of your bitcoin to anyone. If you're worried about losing your keys, you use non-custodial key recovery services.
People don't understand this now, because the market is very young. They will when it's time.
@_date: 2019-10-17 10:00:27
Why the hell would you want to use bitcoin in such scenario? If your money is held by a 3rd party, payments go through banks, and the merchant can only ever see fiat, there's absolutely no reason to use bitcoin over fiat.
Bitcoin is here so we can drop the corrupt financial system, not to integrate into it.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:54:50

@_date: 2019-12-04 14:14:47
Fluctuations are temporary as we're going through a price discovery process.
Value is also subjective. USD is not an absolute measure of value, we just price a lot of stuff in USD. USD loses value constantly, yet prices stay relatively stable. When we start pricing things in satoshis, bitcoin will seem stable even though its value relative to other assets will still fluctuate.
USD is just a product like everything else.

No, it only works on a few bitcoin-related subs. Not sure how Reddit handles it, but I think both mods of the sub and the bot operator would have to set this up.

Bitcoin makes trust optional. Unlike in the current financial system, you don't have to trust a 3rd party, but you can if you want to.

Dude just stop. That's provably bullshit and repeating the same old lies over and over again ain't gonna change shit. Bitcoin is gonna keep producing blocks that follow the exact same monetary policy that was there since its inception. Developers are gonna build amazing apps on top of the chain. LN works just fine today and it's only gonna get better. No amount of FUD can change that so why are you wasting your time...
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:59:42
Prove it. Go ahead and steal money from my LN node. If you succeed I'll happily admit it's insecure.
Nothing has changed since 2016. Bitcoin is still the most secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant form of money with fixed, fully predictable monetary policy. Nothing is even remotely close to having these properties.

There are many whales in the space that still have huge influence on the price. The real-world usage is growing every day, but it's not quite there yet to overshadow the massive speculative capital.
My best guess is we need several more years of organic growth before we see whales' influence dwindle.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:51:34
Unfortunately only liquidity reduces their influence. As long as they have enough capital to clear order books on exchanges, they can cause price swings and panic.
