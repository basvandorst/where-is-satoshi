Does it sync with bitmex?

Please please please. No app supports the futures exchange that I can see. They have a very well documented api explorer.

How exactly did they manipulate the market?

How are you not just choosing to see what you want to see? What SPECIFICALLY was insider trading? Shitty roll out sure but that as specific evidence isn't enough.

What sources where? I'm on coinmarketcap and livecoinwatch I don't see this anywhere.


Advertise as Bitcoin the specific thing or as a set of ideals? Because if you're referring to Roger Ver my understanding is he's selling a set of ideals. That set of ideals is called bitcoincash.


Interesting I was able to explain what a fork was to my 70 year old parents and they understood it just fine.


How is this solved by renaming it to Bcash? This can happen with any crypto if you don't understand how wallet/cryptos work to begin with.
I'm just not buying these as legitimate arguments. :/ To me it sounds like people have dug their heels in the sand. This is coming from someone who does 90% of their trading in base BTC with holdings in ~ the top 3% of all BTC wallet holders. However I'm COMPLETELY agnostic to the "winner" of the crypto-sphere I don't know people have a religious type attitude with respect to this stuff. It comes across as pure tribalism.

This isn't genius at all it's the general modus operandi. 
However, it's not as easy as "I'll just 1031 YOLO until tax day"  Read below

Then we agree. It's shitty but it isn't evidence of anything other than a poor roll out of which some people god screwed present party not excluded mind you.
Also why do people on this sub call it bcash?

Why does no one get this? It's like they fucking looked at the price on their coinbase app and instantly jumped to market manipulation.
Orders weren't filled. FYI here's a screen shot of what GDAX looked like, keep in mind that the trade history wasn't moving at all as the sell wall was growing. I think the largest value I saw was over 11K.

I don't think is being that unreasonable, however you pose what is the most likely scenario. I'd still like to see the source doccuement. 
I don't know why the anonymous contributor didn't want to post the source and scraping through the comment neither anyone seems either interested in the source material or have posted it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:34:15
I can't find the source material which is a bit frustrating.

"proof" is a bit of a stretch
