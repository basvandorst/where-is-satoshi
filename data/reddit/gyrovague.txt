Care to show your complete calculations? What is the monthly power usage in kWh?

He may have died unexpectedly, and it may not have been worth enough at the time that he thought to make any arrangements. From what I understand, the coins thought to belong to him (over one million of them!) have remained untouched for years.

Some countries have so-called ring-fencing laws, whereby (as I understand it) losses can only be applied against similar asset classes, and not against general income. A capital loss in cryptocurrency investments can then only be used against future cryptocurrency profits (maybe stock investments too, not sure how loosely the fences are defined exactly).

Is even that true though? I seem to remember having weathered a few truly massive dips the past few years (close to 50% down from peaks etc.). I guess if one wants to take into account the percentage dip along with the current value, then perhaps there is some merit in such a claim.
Either way, I think everyone here agrees the title itself is completely misleading or dishonest.

I'd consider selling (some) if my wallet reaches $1M, but then chances are that $1M might be worth considerably less than it is now, or one can actually use bitcoin directly everywhere. 
Maybe someday it'll be better to be a bitcoin millionthaire (21btc) than a dollar millionaire.

To be fair, it was supposed to sound horrifying in context too :P Alec Guinness really delivered.

That's true, but OTOH if they're buying/selling btc to backup the trades on the ETF, they'd be doing it on their exchange at those prices, not the prices on other btc exchanges. Seems to me they just need to be clear about it being a Gemini btc ETF basically, if they aren't already.
