Its quite worrisome that all the Help/Support links in their website's footer go to empty pages (e.g.

Instacoin ATM's only accept cash. What you are (barely) describing is impossible.
@_date: 2016-04-08 23:52:21
Our Lamassu Bitcoin ATMs only accept *cash* as a method of payment.

It could be used in the way you describe and you definitely can just sell your coins at the BTM, but the main reason is so that users don't have to wait at the machine (or in the host location really) for their transaction to confirm. You can put in your order and send your coins from the comfort of your home, then pick up the cash whenever is convenient for you (although we suggest you do it the same day).

UPDATE: Selling altcoins is now available at most ATMs.
Instacoin introduced multi-cryptocurrency support at the majority of their Bitcoin ATMs. Currently, you can purchase and sell the following altcoins:
* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
* Litecoin (LTC)
* Dash (DASH)
~~The option for you to sell these coins as well as more altcoins,~~ More altcoins, such as Ethereum, Zcash and Monero, will be available by the end of the month.

No need to sit and wonder, altcoin rates are available in real-time on the website. All you need to do is choose your location and your altcoin. Here's an example:

I don't understand the point of tipping somebody for commenting...but tipping on Soundcloud is a great idea!

Thank you for your comment and questions. There are many reasons and perhaps they do.

Thank you for your comment and suggestion. Why? Many reasons (e.g. remittances). 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:44:30
Good feature. We'll be contacting you soon with a price feed.

I find myself using Amazon to buy products very often. Good prices + incredibly fast delivery. The ability to pay by Bitcoin would complete the trifecta.

Thank you for your interest in Instacoin. It is a 1-way Lamassu machine that lets you buy Bitcoin. We will be launching 2-way machines in the near future. We'll keep you posted.
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:35:09
You forgot one of the most important parts...the vault! If you want something usable and professional you are grossly underestimating the cost.

Thanks for the comments guys. The rate is displayed &amp; updated on the [Instacoin website]( and it is very competitive.
As some have commented, Bitcoin "ATMs" shouldn't really be compared to a standard banking ATM. The term ATM has been adopted by most in the Bitcoin industry for its familiarity, but in reality Bitcoin ATMs are currency exchange vending machines.

We're glad you enjoyed the experience and thank you for posting the great vid!

UPDATE: modifying txconfirmtarget from 2 to 3 reduced the fee back to normal and tx's confirming right away.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:38:03
225-400 bytes, pretty much standard size tx's [core v0.13, set to 2 blocks (default)].

Thanks for your comments. Two-way functionality will be released at select machines soon. We will also be launching some time-saving features related to selling Bitcoin soon after, but that is all we can say for now. Currently, the buy rate at Beau-Soir is at 5.5%.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:41:10
Several new two-way locations coming soon to the Toronto and Montreal regions. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 15:31:02
Prices are in CAD$ and vary per location. Real-time prices are available [here](

Thank you for your questions and comments.
Although our current focus is deploying BTM's and making Bitcoin more accessible, we are trying to help merchants to accept Bitcoin. The reality is that there is no magic bullet solution to allow merchants to accept Bitcoin. Many complications exist that have made the process for interested merchants quite lengthy. These obstacles include things such as accounting and POS integration.

Thank you for your business and kind praise. We have 10 machines around the city now, but should have 12 soon for added convenience. If ever you have suggestions on how we can improve our service, please message us, it would be much appreciated.

$2,500 CAD.

Oh, only two ATMs listed for France on Coin ATM Radar. That number looks even lower when compared to Spain's 36. I'm quite surprised. Why do think adoption or development is so low?
