I've seen this, but how up to date would that be for someone like subway? This map will be awesome once it populates.

Donno much about Andy but I know Chris. He's a used car salesman turned silver peddler.
I've personaly been banned by Chris for my dissenting views on his forum. Not cool from someone that preaches "Listen to all, follow none".
This video proves Duane's bitcoin ignorance and jealousy.
He so hates bitcoin because he is all in on silver, and expected silver to save the world - not bitcoin.

This growth may be technological adoption, not a typical stock pattern... This guys video explains more.. We should be comparing this to google or facebooks adoption rate, no?

Yeah, I think they just want to see it say sent on your phone... can't really get it back after that anyways :D
Hrmm and doesn't this sound like it would be better with a faster alt-coin like LTC or FTC?
