Twitter censors content, according to ambiguous and subjective rules that they shift on a whim. Too bad that they censor Bitcoin mentions like this, although like some posters are saying, it gets it even more attention.

Satoshi is a ringer for benefitting mankind

What if 1000 coins were hacked from an exchange and those hacked coins were dumped in your bitcoin address? You might not go to jail, but you might have to answer questions, waste time etc. It would be a headache for you to deal with at the very least. The main theme is that problems can be created because you can't control what is deposited in your address. What if hackers stole 10,000 coins and deposited coins into some random addresses on the blockchain and a handful of new addresses that they control? That could create confusion and waste police time. There are some tiers to this that could have legs. Most of the examples in the article aren't likely or may not work out, but there are some ways that malicious depositing into accounts could be an issue.

You make a good point, especially on the diversification/protection point. This is chart i think is also helpful for people who have money trapped in 401k's etc. and can't use that cash to make direct investments in crypto because of withdrawal penalties or tax implications

Thats right. There are tons of variables here. A main point is that most people are not thinking of Satoshi in the light of richest in the world, but I think it very well will be him and if it is, it will be much harder to displace him as the wealthiest. Also- Satoshi will have done it in an incredible way- not one angry/unhappy/ill treated employee.

Thats true. Satoshi also has \~ 980,000 Bitcoin Cash and other alts he could dump first. It's also theoretical to guess what BCH might be when BTC gets above $100,000 - that would really change the numbers.

I like that analogy of your boss/overtime. 
I also agree with your rationale of millennials not owning much of anything, including cryptocurrency. On the whole millennials have lots of one thing, which isn't necessarily an asset to them, like a retirement account would be-- student loan debt.

I feel like if Satoshi does show back up, it will be dumping alts before doing anything with BTC. That is a big what if though, it would be a surprise if Satoshi came back, based on his cypherpunk value system

This is smart- really strong logic - increased people = increased risk
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:52:15
That would be pretty incredible. Not sure Bezos has the crypherpunk domain knowledge though.

This poster thinks "a few guys in suits" actually do the typing. Rooms full of interns, aides and consultants do any of the actual work required. Highly likely many of the suits do not know how to type.
