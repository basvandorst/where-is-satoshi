im not trying to gain anything.
i'm warning others to not make the same mistake i did
not everything is about personal gain

they have changed the support reply time to 72 hours this week. every person is having trouble with this site right now. i think they are exit scamming increasing the support reply time to 72 hours and creating usual delays on purpose so people will think its normal then taking the money
its BCH to LTC both are fast coins there is no reason other than them running a scam BE VERY CAREFUL

how about you do a google search and see all the complaints for yourself idiot
i have never used reddit before I created this account to complain on their reddit and when they blocked my comment on their reddit page i posted it in btc and bitcoin
go look at changelly reddit page, they have blocked anyone from making comments now
i find it odd that you dismiss the scam completely and try give people confidence when there is an obvious scam going on
what company disables all messages on their public forum
what company advertises 15-30min transactions and ignores peoples e-mails for up to 8 days
something is wrong BEWARE EVERYONE
