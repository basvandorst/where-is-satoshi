Actually I retract that last comment. Essentially you take a large word file, run it through brainflayer, and it will check to see if it matches any addresses you have in your bloom file. Is that correct? I think that's right at least.

You can import the private key of that address you got the Bitcoins into another wallet program like electrum or multibit.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:18:08
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:13:39
There's some python library out there that generates an address based on the number. So if there's 10,000 different bitcoin addresses possible (this is for example) you do some command like
    bitcoin.py 1
So then it will generate the first address w/ private key out of the 10,000 (for example) but in turn you can just generate all of the possible 10k addresses. I don't recall exactly the name of the program but it has something to do with entropy and the max number of addresses possible. Obviously there's more than 10k bitcoin addresses possible, but what I think is that this website is just inputting the numbers to the python program then out puts the addresses in that section in HTML. I may be wrong but just a thought.
Oh! Found this

I believe it's due to the amount of CPU (or GPU) usage the programs use. While the programs aren't malicious, Norton flags them as such because botnets can use them to harvest infected computer's CPU/GPU power.

@_date: 2013-11-06 02:24:07
I'll try my best here...


You can trade Bitcoin stocks/commodities at  or "hash packs" or "GHS" at  Both of which you can do the typical buy low, sell high type thing. Alternatively, buy the bitcoin stock/commodity for the long run and wait. Rather than explain the whole cex.io deal, here's the FAQ:
You can see my previous post which had some tools, tickers, etc if you want to day trade.  


You can day trade smaller cryptocurrencies like Primecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Quarkcoin, etc. Because these alt currencies are lesser in value compared to Bitcoin, you'll get a lot of a that coin when exchanging .1 BTC for example. Same thing as above, you can watch the trends and do the buy low sell high deal. 
Think as if (the alt coin) it's a "penny stock" in a sense. If you have a lot of a certain coin that's lesser in value compare to BTC, but if it only goes up by a bit, you'll make more than just day trading BTC alone.


The $12, 336MH/s AISCMiner USB sticks probably will never make an ROI. Over at  you'll see the details if you plug the data in (link:  While on the other hand, we can compare it to a KNCMiner Jupiter ( I have it set to 0 electricity costs, no pool fee or shipping cost. If you're lucky enough, you could get one in November if you pre-ordered or bought one second hand from someone who got a pre-order but at a much higher price.
* AISCMiner USB: No ROI
* KNCMiner Jupiter: Possible ROI, but requires more $$$.
As mentioned in the first point, you could look at cex.io which mines at ghash.io. So, if you buy low and sell high, not only do you make BTC from that but you also make BTC from what it mined for you at the pool.
Alternatively, you could mine alt coins as well. Not sure on the whole ROI deal, but it may be worth a shot. If you did, just convert it to BTC and you're set.
To add to point 3, here's some profitability calculators.

No problem, few tips:
* Have your private keys printed off and store them in a safe or somewhere secure.
* If using blockchain.info for an online wallet, keep the private keys as well, use 2 factor auth and use other things that may help you recover your account.
* If using Bitcoin-qt on your computer, backup wallet.dat to a flashdrive or external drive.
Hope that helps!

Huh, nothing like a scam or a virus, right?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:35:40
If you still have your wallet .dat file on your computer, you should be good to go if you haven't deleted it or placed a password on it that you forgot. Just in case run a data recovery software on your HDD and it may come up. Check any other older computers, flash drives, CDs, external HDs, etc.
The wallet .dat is stored in the Bitcoin program folder which can be found by typing %appdata% into the Explorer window if you're in Windows.
I recommend using offline wallets or Bitcoin QT on your computer. No online wallets.
EDIT: gets the reward...?

You're better off mining alt coins and converting them to Bitcoin. Here are some sites to calculate your profit (or loss):
Also, found this on bitcointalk.org. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:59
Oh that. They are working on alt coin deposits I think (not 100% sure), and that NMC to GHS is only if you've mined some NMC with their merged mining option possibly (not 100% sure either).
They have a thread on Bitcointalk.org with some FAQ and updates.

I only have 1 BTC, so split you think? 
@_date: 2013-10-10 01:38:15
If you want to check the private key offline, a quick thought of mine was the following. Load Bitcoin-Qt onto your computer, unplug your computer from the router/internet then import the private key. It should import it and show the public address. 
Optional: Sync with blockchain, unlpug from internet, then import private key.

Why not take a picture of your miner rig with your username on a post-it note or sheet of paper? That way there's *some* sort of verification.

I was tipped via the Coinbase bot and was given the same error. I have a reply below with a guide that may help. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:47:13
Either or works. Generally Bitcoin-QT with an encrypted wallet is the safest, however, for long term storage a paper wallet is best. Why it is the "safest"? Because online wallets like Blockchain can go down or run away with your coins. Blockchain is really reputable and wouldn't run away with them though.
If you use Blockchain as your main option, be sure to backup the priv keys of all your addresses.
Note: Be sure to read up on deterministic wallets too.

You could import all your address to blockchain.info if you have the private keys. Then in turn maybe send all of the dust to one single address. You will need the .0005 fee unless you have it turned off. You'd be better off buying the BTC locally or using moneygram via bitinstant. Coinbase.com offers an option for you to link your bank account as well.

It's nice to see miners do that, even when they could keep it if they wanted to.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:58:42
When you buy a GHS contract, it's yours until you sell it. So you can sell it in a day, week, hour, etc. That's the nice thing, you aren't locked in to a certain time period.
Price for GHS is at the top of the page at GHS/BTC. By "compound automatically", any BTC you mine is automatically added to your available balance which you can use to buy more GHS or withdraw or such.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:44:34
Obligatory: @_date: 2013-11-19 00:17:11
Not a good idea. I would recommend buying GHS packs at  Plus you can sell them later too. So you'll make money from mining but also if you sell them for more than what you paid for.

GetDataBack may do just the trick. Have it scan the computer for the deleted wallet.dat, then if it is possible to recover, maybe look into getting the full version of the program?
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:33:26


In theory yes, because they are in that address and can't be spent.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:04:30
You can buy them in any increment you'd like. You could buy a half of GHS for ~.04 BTC which is 500 mh/s of power or .25 GHS which is ~.02 BTC (200 mh/s). 
Feel free to tip if you'd like if I've helped. Anyhow I'm glad to answer any questions the best I can.

Login to Coinbase -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Bitcoin Addresses
You should see a new address there with the amount I believe. If not, search the new address on blockchain.info
To get the coins out of the address, I am guessing send some coins to that address, wait for coinbase to verify the transaction and for it to go through, then end it to your main address.
Note: Haven't tested that method, just a guess.
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:11:57


Exactly, I think we're up to 3 or 4 now.

*IF* you're lucky, you can do a deep scan using recovery software on your hard drive and if you manage to find the wallet.dat that stored your bitcoins, you can save that to a flash drive, then re-import it after the deep scan.

You can buy fractions of bitcoins, all the way down to a satoshi. If you're looking to get money into an exchange, there will be fees and such. There's options to buy it locally, but usually there's still some sort of a fee/% added on. Just something to take note of. :)

Got a question. I just made a paper wallet there and want to load BTC onto it. When the time comes and I want to spend it, can I spend BTC to multiple address in one transaction that way I don't lose an BTC? For example, I have .5 total, I send .1 to X (for a payment) and .4 to Y (another paper wallet I created). Is that possible?

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:45:00
If you've got the computer within access, I would get that back up and running ASAP. If not, you're out of luck as the wallet .dat stores the addresses which have the Bitcoins.

Right now they are about .08 BTC a GHS. That's $64 a piece based on Mt Gox's prices. It's high, but you're also paying for the convenience, no set up, no electricity, etc.
But still, if you buy 10 and it goes from .08 to .085 you made .05 BTC on top of what top of what you made mining. So it's like a double whammy so to speak (note: can always go down too).
Also, when buying the GHS it mines at

I have heard that if your reject the package or don't sign it, you will get your chargeback (not 100% sure, may vary on a person to person basis). If you end up taking the package, you could turn around and sell it on bitmit or mine alt coins.

@_date: 2013-05-29 23:39:50
Ah okay, thanks for that. IIRC your client does have to be synced up to show your balance. So if I send BTC to the paper wallet I just created, and redeemed the private key in bitcoin-qt, but my client was only synced to 3 weeks ago, my BTC won't show up until it's synced with the block that contained my BTC. Make sense kinda?
I wish there was a way so that in 1 transaction, you can send different btc amounts to different addresses. That way it's still kinda of paper-wallet friendly. Send the payment to X address then the leftover to Y address which is your new paper wallet all from bitcoin-qt.

For those wanting to the review the code, you can see it on Guthub. 
What I recommend is download the copy to your computer, open it in Chrome or FF with your computer **unplugged** from the internet, make the paper wallet, print and you're good to go. 
Optional: reboot computer just in case if your printer saves cached files or something. 
EDIT: You can supply your own keys as well if you think the program is changing how it generates the priv key. I'm not endorsing the use of it, I just posted the source for those curious.
