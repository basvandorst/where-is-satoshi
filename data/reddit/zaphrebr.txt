Can i have your stuff once you commit suicide?

You need a handull of people to completelly crash the market, there´s no secret in it. If you look on the big picture, cryptos are worth nothing... a major bank could wipe most cripto coins out of existance.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:51:34
Just remove the 9000
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:38
I believe in cryptos, bitcoin... not so much
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:52
Coincindence for this to come in the middle of a crash? I think not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:02
damn, sorry man.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:09
Been on that boat for over 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:07
Why shoud we ask you anything?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:21
They are doing some really shitty merketing stunts lately. Trade tournaments for cars, shit like that.... That just seems unprofessional to me.
That crap aside... it´s good to trade alts in there honestly, i find it very reliable and the fees are fairly good.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:22
Maybe a horror to you, but the guy that purchased @ 900 back in january isn´t really worried about a minor correction in his near 20x investment multiplier.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:14
Successfull altcoins are most likely to eventually pull money out of bitcoin into themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:15:22
I´m sorry, but btc is only worth anything when is back to fiat in my back account. Taxes are paid when taxes are due.
22% in brazil btw.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:46
Very safe
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:03:50
Most likely BTC will get replaced by something better, that´s how technologyu works.
We just don´t know what or when yet, but it will.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:06:11
well, ipm 24 hours in, so congrats!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:51
why hold if ytou can sale and buy it cheaper later?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:35
It can add more decimals if the network comes to a consensus, but the total ammount will never change

This could be the worse or best business decision you ever had.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:41:55
Which crash?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:49
Same boat man...
16 hours, was going to get some ripple at 0.70, now it is 1.20 and my btc is nowhere near binance 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:14:39
nearly 300k transactions on the backlog. Welcome to the future.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:59:31
Even if it is a bubble, there are still trillions and trillions of dollars to pour into the market before the alleged bubble even start to inflate. Look at the marketcap, 250-300b... that´s nothing, Apple market cap is nearly 3x that, and Apple is one single company.
Unlike tulips, mortgage bonds and dotcoms, BTC is an investment accessible to every single person on the globe, while every other bubblew was either limited by location or a very niche type of investor.
Fluctuations will happen, but  the so long expected bitcoin crash, thats very far from happening.

This is just sad.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:44:47
Sit and wait man, there are 280k transactions backlog. It´s going to be a fun ride until after christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:25:21
Whoa, no one has never... ever... posted this here before. Really, i have never seen that image related to bitcoin... ever.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:48:54
People should stop worrying about "the crash", if it happens and when it happens it will be too late to do anything about it.
By the time you send your coins to an exchange and convert to USD your coins will be worth nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:23
Nice, all dem fractions
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:27
Bitcoin is not money. People who think it is ate a minority mostly holding fractions of bitcoins. People are making actual money trading it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:40:02
Well, atleast he will get his coins... i´m here waiting for 48 hours for the future of money to arrive in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:08
BTC initial purpose was:
Fast cheap P2P transactions.
It is P2P, but its certainly not cheap, nor fast at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:53
Wait, maybe you will get it by 2018. You are certainly not alone.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:16:38
Well, atleast you got your coins... mine are on the limbo for the past 72hrs
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:04
If you are in this position, imagine i with 256 sat/B... and i´m "only" waiting for 18 hours. I´m soon to consider that money gone to be honest. 
How about that for P2P low fee fast transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:28:45
I don´t think you fully understand the meaning of the word "profit".
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:31:43
The problem is that the transactions backlog is only rising lol, and mine is most likely going down by the second in terms of priority.
275k backlog, damn.... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:27:51
It isnt
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:43:20
Most likely it´s going to be in the place you stored safely, which was suggested by yout wallet when you created it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:41:01
It´s not their fault, the network can´t handle beeing used apperantly.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:06:34
Well boys, Adam Smith was wrong all along, thankfully some random economics master happened to be online on reddit to corret what was beeing wrongfully thought for the past 200 years.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:12:33
Bitcoin is just not beeing "updated" as fast as the blockchain technology is advancing. Simple as that. Bitcoin might be arround as a digital asset in the future, but its purpose as a currency is long gone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:52:22
At the current state, i´m currently fine with my bank account and credit card, btc is just free money sided with some shitcoins that lets you take money from teenagers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:09:57
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:28:20
There are still trillions of dollars to pour into bitcoin and cryptos currencies as a whole to even start to inflate as a bubble.
People are comparing something limited as stock exchanges or tulip mania to something that is accessible from the poorest to the richest.

Because you don´t see CNN dowing a week long coverage on anything other than BTC. People that watch those reports look at the easy money, they don´t treat as a currency, nor they should.

i am.

And you btc need his validation because? 
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:10:24
Well, they need money. Not fake money.
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:34:40
Yeah, since 2014
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:09:23
Remember that you only own bitcoin when they are on your wallet that you generated
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:27:20
You would be surprised. And your reaction just shows how naive you are.
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:14:42
Pretty much all of the big exchange wallets have their ownership public. And remember how easy it is to make this market crash and burn, take 1 person with deep pockets to make you cry or laugh, stop dreaming that Bitcoin is the libertarian currency you think it is. 
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:52:23
Until I'm able to live 100% out of BTC without caring about the fiat value, BTC will only be considered a novelty toy for me.
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:51:34
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:45:27
I'm not scared of this, I just can see from a mile away how easily this market can be manipulated.
@_date: 2018-10-19 21:58:09
What you call something that is held in it's majority by a minority?

Yeah, now we are only 15000usd behind the ATH

I can't pay my suppliers with cryptos, I can't pay my utilities with cryptos, I can't pay my taxes with cryptos, I can't pay my employees with cryptos, I can't pay my rent with cryptos... Do I need to go on?
If I accept cryptos all it would do to my business is add one extra step on a transaction, since I would have to convert to Fiat anyways, and add an unnecessary risk due to high volatility.
Nope, I'm good. Buying shit with cryptos has only a novelty value to it, it doesn't bring business to an establishment, it is not practical nor safe.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:30:30
Don't expect 2017 happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:30:41
I'm a business owner and I guarantee you I will never accept cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:32:37
Some people just like to play pretend
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:25:49
That shows how little you know about cryptos. I'm honestly done, you are a waste of my time, which you couldn't afford an hour of it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:18:32
And lets not forget that time TIME magazine named Hitler man of the year in 1938, we all know how that went well.

@_date: 2018-11-18 11:15:50
As any other volatile market, once a contract is negotiated the price gets frozen. If they contracted him to sell they 250k in Bitcoin, that's the amount of BTC he needs to deliver. 
They didn't negotiate a future contract, if the price fluctuated after the fact, that's his problem.
If you sell 1 BTC on a exchange today for 5000, and tomorrow 1 BTC shots up to 10000, you will still have only 5000. Same as if it goes down.
He is wrong, they are right an
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:46:23
I actually pay 1.9% debit and 2.9% credit with no monthly fees, 24 hours the money is on my account on debit, end of the month on credit. It's safe, every single client of mine has a credit card and this is 100% guaranteed to increase sales on any business and not to mention I don't pay those fees, that is imbued in the price and the client pays for it. 
I rather have to pay 1.9% on my machine and accept something that everyone uses than pay 1.25% on an unreliable technology just for the sake of being edgy, and no, it will not attract new clients, that's absurd.
You can try all you want, there's absolute nothing you can say that would even make me twitch an eyebrow about accepting cryptos on my stores. Cryptos are not safe, its unreliable and adds an unnecessary risk to any Business.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:23:53
Actually no, credit card adoption by retailers was very well accepted and had no resistance since  it came as an insurance for business owners that tye product was going to get payed. Businesses were working on credit long before credit cards came, most of them supplying credit from their own pocket.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:29:30
I don't think it can go below 0

Isn't Robinhood just trading options, I was told you don't actually buy the asset there, just a position.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:48:18
Because of safety, that's why. Besides, you can transfer Bitcoin, but you still need to pay fees to convert to fiat and usually way more than 1.5%
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:38:47
It will surely go up, down or remain as is
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:51:17
No, futures are a whole different thing, it seems that on Robinhood you will not actually buy crypto currency, you will just place a bet on a price range and keep an open position on that, you will not own the coin.
I could be wrong, if someone else could confirm this.

Yes, until you receive a deposit in fiat or if you deposit fiat on any of the major exchanges. Then the IRS would be able to trace every single Bitcoin you own.

It can go up, it can go down, it can remain the same. There, I predicted
