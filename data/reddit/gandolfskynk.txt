Pretty weird that he had DNS control of the Close domain, no? Is there a way to look up historical DNS records and see where srv2.close.co was pointing a week or two ago?

My 2 cents says that yes, 90% of people do not know the word fiat, and I only do because of Bitcoin, and I find it pretentious as hell.

What doesn't work, so I know ahead of time? I signed up and seemed to get through okay so far but maybe haven't completed everything. I did add a bank account though.

Before I read any more than 3 or 4 comments, I want to say that I found this very, very intriguing and loaded up a site to check if this had possibly moved Bitcoin's current price. This is exciting.

I got this email and saw 2 people discussing it on Twitter at exactly the same time, so I knew it must be very common - interesting, I wonder if anyone fall for this scam.
You'd think that the people who actually HAVE Bitcoin wouldn't fall for this, but who know.

It's so weird, yes, the amount of actual critical analysis this has received is 0. The guy in question is KNOWN for doing all sorts of manipulative things too, he has an extensive past of making stuff up to get people in legal trouble, pre-Silk Road.

Sorry, I wasn't clear: I found out who the OP actually is irl, and he is a very trustable ethical person who 100% would pay.
@_date: 2015-09-17 00:08:59
I think you are being a bit intellectually dishonest yourself, I think saying "He's essentially stealing funds" is completely unfair, it is a VERY big thing to throw around the word "stealing" in the Bitcoin community in my opinion, and should not be used THIS lightly when so many ACTUAL thefts are taking place.
I do not follow the regulations closely, but I am pretty sure that new regulations for being a money-transferer were passed at some point, correct? Were these not AFTER Bitcoinbuilder opened, so now he must abide by them?
Either way, I do not use Über and I don't plan to use this service, and I never traded Bitcoins on the original incarnation of the site, but I think saying "very dishonest" is just so incorrect, when it just seems like he was forced to change things due to regulations (I could be wrong on the timing of the money-transfering laws, I am not in the USA and I did not follow that perfectly)
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:16:56
I would bet he didn't recover it, it seemed very tough to do, also I think this guy would have paid.
@_date: 2015-09-17 01:33:54
It's bizarre that you say he "doesn't have to abide" by the rules and THEN call him dishonest, it's contradictory.
Regardless, you should realize that every Bitcoin company that ran off with people's money were businesses that didn't abide by the rules. The fact that Bitcoinbuilder IS doing all the correct paperwork and staying legal is actually a good thing. (cough)
@_date: 2015-09-22 02:46:13
Just sticking chips in things that let a user get a small amount of Bitcoin without any hassle at all, and starting a flow of exchange, products, and commerce is HUGE. If enough people use it and get into it, it'll be a great introduction to how frictionless Bitcoin can be, and some people will definitely go and buy additional Bitcoin to use inside the system.
Once they had a much cheaper unit, this could be a huge factor in much more widespread Bitcoin adoption AND actual usage.

Wow yes, this actually DOES make more sense than the stated post. It's SO bizarre that he would just create an address and immediately send SO much to it so fast and not copy the private key, it's bizarre.
@_date: 2015-09-18 03:18:59
I don't mean someone SHOULD, I mean that would be a valid reason to trace things, but just banning coins would be bad

If you actually read about the real implications of a truly superintelligent AI popping up, the whole idea of them being able to obtain new hardware is actually quite prevalent, and the general view is that an AI that was even just as smart as the smartest human being, could easily social engineer itself into some money, and an AI that was, say, 5 times smarter than a human, could hack all sorts of systems to obtain money/equipment. No Bitcoin needed, but it's still a funny post, I'm just the guy who jumps into a joke and points out annoying related un-joke things :)
@_date: 2015-09-08 16:29:39
It seems like even just disabling the button to create a new address would be a good solution, and making the user reload the page. But who does this honestly happen to...
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:20:36
Most may do that, but the good ones stick to the original template, IMO
@_date: 2015-09-14 19:10:19
This doesn't seem serious. I think it's possible.
@_date: 2015-09-19 17:17:06
This is funny, because also last week in a thread about Bitcoinbuilder, complained about their logo and that also got changed. Maybe Bitcoin is finally gaining hold in design community.
@_date: 2015-09-17 14:19:54
Tracking them is good, yes, but actually somehow blacklisting them is not. In my opinion, tracking them should be for the purpose of contacting everyone at each step and figuring out where they got the coins from, until you reach the original step. This is obviously technically possible, but in most cases probably clearly impossible, but you understand what I am mening.

I am way behind all this, but I just read the older Antilop.cc article that (I think) originally doxed Variety Jones, and talks about Plural of Mongoose, and one thing was very clear in it: Variety Jones was a constant manipulator and game-player, dating to pre-Silk Road days where he got his enemies into legal trouble and extorted people constantly and was just generally a very sneaky guy, always working many angles.
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:25:11
Isn't this article talking about maybe 2% of what went missing? It smells like they're setting him up to appease everyone. I'm not saying he's innocent, but this is the best they can do?
If the guy is borderline autisitc like everybody says, perhaps he truly did just think that the company was his, so the money was his and so why should he not borrow it for a bed and 3D rendering software., In my youthly days I might have made the same choice, I certainly had some sloppy bookkeeping when I had a business.

p.s. I am worried that my reply makes it sound like I agree with Uber (maybe because I am German and like their name) -  definitely not! I just am saying I can imagine this is probably their problem with the BitcoinBuilder service, it makes sense to me that this could be the issue,.
@_date: 2015-09-08 16:26:36
Why do you think this?? If I did this, I'd probably close the browser and go "okay, that takes care of that!"
Nobody would think "I better shut the machine down in case this guy goes on Reddit and tries to recover my information from RAM!"

I just wanna go on record for saying that I 100% know this is a legit post and this guy isn't scamming anyone, because I know who it is now, and sorry for being so suspicious (although come on it's bitcoin world)
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:04:12
So I agree with all his points, but I want to add that Bitcoin is a very short, memorable name, and while it doesn't get the point across perfectly, and is a bit confusing metaphorically, it DID grab the public's attention, and let the concept catch on, and there were a million media articles about Bitcoin.
Someone in the comments mentioned how Ethereum might be a better name. So sure, perhaps it's more accurate, but it would be a HORRIBLE name:
1. Hard for average people to spell.
2. Hard for average people to pronounce.
3. The connotations of "being in the ether" completely play into the notion of bitcoin being "make believe" money, which is NOT good for Bitcoin.
I'm just using that as an example of how something that may be a better term on a purely literal level, would not necessarily benefit Bitcoin.
Also his point about physical coins, YES, I agree with this 10000%, it is terrible, but perhaps we should also look at them and say wellllll, did this concept have any benefit in getting Bitcoin covered in the press? Did some journalists decide that they could write about this extremely new and confusing concept because at least they could throw in a stupid image of a coin with a large B on it? 
I honestly don't know about that last thing - it would probably have been better if that whole stupid concept never caught on or happened, but PERHAPS there were benefits. I am not sure, but regardless, you have to ask, what can be done about it now?? Perhaps everyone interviewed about Bitcoin simply has to tell the reporter flat out "Listen, you can not stick a stock image of a physical bitcoin on this, because it's completely incorrect, it's terribly cliched, and 50 years from now you'll wind up in a compilation of articles that look laughably quaint, like when they show TV segments from 1992 about THIS NEW THING CALLED THE INTERNET"
When it comes down to it, I think Bitcoin has all these metaphor problems simply because it is inherently confusing! Getting some average member of the public to understand it is like getting them to think about what 11-dimensional space is like - they simply are not prepared in ANY WAY to process this. There is no easy metaphor that will aid them, because if there was, it would intrinsically mean that Bitcoin was something different (less novel/revolutionary). That's why these metaphors all suck, but it's what exists, and as crappy as they are, at least they gave people an illusion that they understand Bitcoin, and they probably DID get people understanding Bitcoin *ENOUGH*
But don't get me wrong, I agree they suck badly.

So? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 02:52:11
I think the odds that some taxi driver was aware of Bitcoinbuilder and acted this fast is small - my guess is that some sort of risk-awareness software at Über raised a red flag because Bitcoinbuilder was suddenly paying for a lot of rides, or also quite possibly someone from Über read about BCB either on Reddit or elsewhere, and decided it probably wasn't part of their TOC
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:21:32
Nah, I can understand why Uber would be worried. If 1000 people used this and BCB wronged people somehow, a decent percentage of them would be soured on Uber, or even be confused and blame Uber directly. 
However, all Uber has to do is set up a deal with BitcoinBuilder and vet them and they could be pretty confidenit that they're not shady, and allow them to be used.
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:49:29
This is the old fallacy of going from "This would actually work if true" to "Okay, I've decided it's true just based on the fact it would be a good idea".
Cloudflare solves a VERY REAL business problem, and that's why they exist. They're a heavily VC-funded company seeking market dominance, and that's why they're incredibly cheap. A trillion other VC-backed companies do things much cheaper than the old-school competition, it doesn't mean the NSA runs all of them.
CF also has an interesting way of running their network, there was an article about it on HN or somewhere like that a while back, they do everything MUCH cheaper than anywhere else, google "cloudflare colocation strategy" or something.

I understand this, but since someone in this thread has already said they wouldn't have signed up if this was the case (but they did), I wonder if you could change it to a shorter time period. 
While requiring a 12 month payment is obviously a disincentive to abusers, it's also a disincentive to people who want a VPS but might not trust a provider they haven't used. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:22:14
This is actually a cool idea - pay 12 months, but refund if the person didn't do abuse. The refund would have to be adjusted for currency fluctuations of course so everyone didn't request refunds if the price of bitcoin skyrocketed.

I am not sure this is so - I bought a gift card (not from Lyft) on Gyft yesterday and it did not ask me for any CC info, it just popped open a  payment window, I sent the payment from my client, and the gift card appeared in my account on Gyft. I did have to create an account on Gyft, but I didn't have to enter any CC stuff.
