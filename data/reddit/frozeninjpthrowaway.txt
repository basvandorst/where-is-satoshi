Given all the others with complaints about Robocoin, your continuous put-downs remind me of a story about a man who thought everyone else was driving down the wrong side of the road when the reality was quite different...
And frankly, even if it wasn't for this they should be getting complaints for the biometric/ID scanning alone.

Which is why I only keep a minimal amount in my wallet. And even then, a thief would have to physically get close to get access to it, whereas according to some, just generating your private key on a computer still connected to the internet opens up the possibility of remote theft. 


Unlike Bitcoin, I have the ability to dispute transactions and ask for chargebacks. Also, if I lose my credit card I can ask for a new one. I bought a few BTC for giggles back when they were less than $1 each, but since I lost the laptop it was on I have no way of getting that wallet.dat back.

Quite frankly, that was because it was *more* convenient, not less. Cellphones brought the ability to be reached from anywhere with mobile signal. E-mail brought the ability to pass documents at the speed of the internet. The alternatives were slower and less convenient.
Bitcoin, on the other hand- You could go through all those complex steps to secure your BTC... or you could stick to using credit and debit cards denominated in fiat currency, or cash. Cards protect you from those with malicious intent and offer value-added benefits, while cash is accepted by most everyone and is easier to secure to a reasonable level due to the existence of third parties dedicated to keeping it secure (banks/credit unions).

Yes, because an ongoing insurgency/war can be waved away just like that.
