Also, isn't it "So you're telling me there's a chance?"

So many things wrong with this post I don't even know where to begin...
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:20:02
That’s the dodgy part - giving them your internet password. I’m not a big fan of it 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:06:34
Probably due to less local liquidity and less options for buying/selling.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:46:32
Yeah I hate that. I wish there was a way you could use credit. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:32:27
I would have... but it was exactly 9000. Didn't go a cent higher.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:30:40
Yeah I agree. And Poli is a little bit dodgy too. 
I'd be okay with bpay except that it has a minimum $500 transfer.

Have they updated the issue they had where the recovery phrase was accessible?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:45:52
Forgive my ignorance, but what about sweeping your private key into a wallet to then transfer the balance... avoid that too?

Thats so frustrating! Had you already put your BTC into their wallet?
I haven't got much experience with exchanges, but I'm pretty sure coinjar and btcmarkets will allow you to withdraw your money if you want to.

I have never used that service but when I wanted to simply transfer my BTC to another wallet it took over a week to actually get it all sorted. For some reason it wouldn't work if I used it on mobile but would only work on a computer. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:34:39
So does that mean you have to transfer it to another exchange if you want to sell? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:22:38
I really hope you're joking.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:40:47
+1 from me too
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:33:09
What website do you use to watch the progress?
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:44:06
Good to know someone can share the frustrations. I wish r/BitcoinAUS was a bit more active.. but it is what it is. 
Thanks for your suggestions though.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:09:30
Yeah they are. Glad you didn't deposit your bitcoin before you found out.
Have you been in BTC long? I'm still learning what the best approach is for us Aussies and it feels like the amount of information for us around is very limited. Any advice?
