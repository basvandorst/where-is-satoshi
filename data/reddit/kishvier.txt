He is a violent criminal and a member of EDL! Fucking far right scum switching betweeen two far right crazy hooligan organizations doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:21:18
So you coudn't name one pedo ring he exposed that I can't find earlier reporting on? 
That simply contradicts the lie that this criminal reported or "exposed" anything. 
"Raised awareness" is such a vague and unquantifiable statement. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:07:55
You can't talk politics anywhere without citing facts which are inconvinient. Like the criminal history of the violent criminal. It's not about Reddit.
























@_date: 2018-11-16 15:32:30
That's not "exposing" anything. After a trial is completed the sentences become public.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:25:33
"fault and made mistakes". A violent criminal who lies about his crimes and his supporters who lie about his violent crimes. 
BNP and EDL are both far right hooligan organizations. He hasn't exposed a single pedo ring. Not one. Just used it to earn money and get support while whitewashing his violent criminal past.
Also beat his wife.

BBC has reported on all the rape gangs. Tommy hasn't done anything for them except profit off the story and be a violent criminal.

As far as I can tell the far right lies. The Tommy supporters lie and bullshit. 
They lie about the criminal tommy who has arrests for multiple assaults. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:04:37
Defending a violent criminal liar because he supports your bigoted far right ideology. You also support Alex Jones so theres no cure for craziness.
























@_date: 2018-11-13 16:14:55
No he didn't. He simply latched on to that. This is simply bullshit propaganda. Give one source to one pedo ring he exposed. 
And I will give a link to reporting on that before that date. This is a lie spread by him and his supporters to make the criminal more important or significant than he is.
One citation with a date attached. Any source.

The first part of your comment is true. 
Until you came to this


Is this violent criminal who beat police officers and lead a far right group and a hooligan group. 
You didn't answer my question. He didn't expose shit. His voice was useless. 
People who actually worked to prosecute these people in the modern times are the heros. People like Nazir Afzhal. Read about him. He has been working on this since 2004. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:23:33
Tommy is a violent criminal who has commited a wide variety of crimes from assault to assault and passport fraud and mortgage fraud. Also a member of far right groups like the BNP and EDL.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:07:05
Pushing scumbag criminals like Tommy is good.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:21:32
He hasn't "exposed" a single pedo gang. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:11:48
What refuting? He is a violent criminal. You liars always try to deflect from that fact. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:21:08
So nothing was actually exposed? People are claiming this criminal nutjob somehow discovered a hidden pedo ring and was the first to expose it.
This story is about a trial that was already happening.  
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:03:47
BNP and EDL. He is a far-right member. And apart from that he is a a violent criminal who has also taken part in white collar crime! Quite a diverse chargesheet. 
























@_date: 2018-11-13 15:59:05
This man is a violent criminal who was arrested for assaulting a police officer and being a part of a far-right hooligan group EDL after leaving an even more far right nazi group called BNP which is full white supremacist. Here is a brief history of this man.

Your stupid bullshit is the actual whataboutism though. This thread is about the violent criminal with the nickname of Tommy Robinson. 




























@_date: 2018-11-13 16:06:33
Some violent criminal who doesn't admit to his violent crimes. Doesn't apologize. Continues to break the law. 
He didn't expose a single pedo. Name one pedo he exposed or brought to justice. 
He only used it to earn money and became a hero for extremists. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:26:34
Which pedophiles did he expose? Any source with the date he "exposed" the pedophiles?
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:56:23
Stop being a far right liar and lying to people about your favorite violent criminal who was arrested for assaulting a police officer who was called for his domestic violence. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:54:18
He has criminal convictions for assaulting a police officer. 
Who was called because Tommy hit his wife.
This man is a violent criminal thug. 
Dumb propoganda youtube videos cant erase these facts.




























@_date: 2018-11-13 16:17:22
That's a lie. List one date and one pedo ring exposed by this violent criminal who used this to get famous. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:08:45
Fuck Tommy. Fuck the far right who support the violent criminal. 
























@_date: 2018-11-13 16:19:55
Name one gang exposed by this criminal who used the issue to become famous and profit off that despite doing fuck all.

Scumbag far right nutjobs will downvote the facts about Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (nickname Tommy Robinson) the violent criminal.
























4. In 2013, he was imprisoned for entering the United States illegally.
Robinson was jailed for 10 months after being convicted of using someone else’s passport to enter the United States while concealing a previous drug conviction. The US does not typically allow people to visit the country if they serious criminal convictions.
He entered the United States illegally using a passport of the name Andrew McMaster and returned on his own passport which bears the name Paul Harris.
 
5. His rap sheet is more than a decade long and filled with multiple violent crimes and financial fraud.
In July 2011 he was convicted for leading a public brawl involving 100 soccer fans. He received a 12-month community rehabilitation order and a three-year ban from soccer.
In November 2011 he was again convicted but narrowly avoided another custodial sentence, this time for assault for head-butting another EDL member at a demonstration. That same month he was also arrested following a protest on the rooftop of the FIFA headquarters in Zurich which resulted in him being detained for three days and fined £3000.
He served 12 months in prison for actual bodily harm for assaulting an off-duty police officer during a domestic incident in 2004. During the assault he kicked a police officer in the head.
In 2014 he was imprisoned for 18 months after being found guilty of mortgage fraud.
 
Tl;dr: Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is a violent criminal who has previously attacked police and who has a history of drug use. And this is the guy being lauded as a hero by the alt right and President Trump’s son?? Wow.

Lies. Tommy didn't do shit expect be a violent criminal.
