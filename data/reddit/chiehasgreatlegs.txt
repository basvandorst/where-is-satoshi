As long as people are willing to expend energy in order to secure the network, this display of faith in the system is what backs it. As long as enough miners secure the network by burning energy, the value of Bitcoin will remain &gt; 0

Right and that's relevant because the majority of Bitcoin users definitely have the same level of technical understanding as the developers who work to improve Bitcoin every day /s

This specific aspect of Bitcoin is very similar to fiat currencies indeed. However, there are many other significant attributes that set it apart from traditional currencies (censorship resistance, fixed supply, global transferability, impossibility of counterfeiting etc.).

ETH on the other hand has migrated from the original chain to an alterated one because users lost money to a scam. Kinda throws the immutability argument out of the window right there.

You should look up the difference between representative democracy and direct democracy. What you are describing is a direct democracy, but almost every state that exists today functions as a representative democracy.  In a representative democracy, the citizens don't get to decide individual policy positions (unless it's under special circumstances such as a referendum), it's the representatives that do.

ETH is more centralized, less censorship resistant, far less immutable, handles a lesser transaction volume, doesn't have Layer 2 scaling solutions on the mainnet and the list goes on.

No altcoins have anywhere near the amount of transactions that the Bitcoin network is dealing with. 3 yeara ago there were no full blocks in Bitcoin. You can't have scaling issues without first achieving scale.

Bitcoin forked due to an unintended bug in the software that clearly violated both the whitepaper and consensus rules. ETH forked because a lot of people voluntarily decided to send money to a malicious actor and were unhappy with the result while even though it was a completely valid and rule compliant outcome.

The network is backed by hashing power which is sustained through the expenditure of electricity/energy.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:58:19
It isn't needed to mine Bitcoin. The amount of hashing power supplied to the Bitcoin network is directly proportional to the network's resistance against hostile takeover attempts.
 
The carbon footprint of mining ie very small compared to the traditional financial systems (think several orders of magnitude smaller) and the use of CO2 emmissive energy resources is disincentivized because miners who use renewable energy sources like hydroelectric dams benefit from much higher profit margins than miners that burn coal at much greater expense.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:18:49
You're right in saying that socialism has never once worked since it has indeed failed every time it was implemented. This is why I gave you the example of Chile under Allende.
However, neither Venezuela under Maduro, China under Mao nor Soviet Russia under Stalin are examples of socialist regimes. They all claim or have claimed to be socialist governments and Western media are happy to paint them as socialist too, but if you take the time to look at their policies throughout their reigns then you will come to the conclusion that all three regimes use socialism as a way of legitimising their domestic and international presence, but don't subscribe to any of its tenets. 
It's just a game of appearances, much like the CPC call their country a republic when this is an obvious lie.
Don't get fooled by this, don't believe everything the media tells you without doing your own research first.

Sounds like you typed in your login info and 2FA code into a phishing website without immediately noticing. Unless the money is still on a Binance account you won't be able to recover it.
The lesson to learn here is that you stored over $20k on an exchange which means you gave up your ownership of Bitcoin in exchange for an IOU. A $50 hardware wallet would have prevented this.

By going long on USD you are risking just as much as someone who is going long on BTC before the announcement.

ETF decision on March 11 will either send the price skyrocketing or plummeting. Best to read up on it a little and decide which way you want to gamble.

Since you don't need to access it in the next few years, I'd say go for it. It's risky, but the reward is huge if it works out. 10x return is not unrealistic for Bitcoin to reach in the next 5 years and with 300k in investments you will be miles ahead of other people at your age.

No worries. An altcoin is basically any cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin. For example, you might have heard of Ethereum, Zcash or Monero before.

To mine with 28TH/s you would need to have the equivalent hashing power of slightly more than 2 Antminer S9 (which cost about $1500 each).
My advice to you is to mine altcoins instead. Their networks are a lot less advanced and you can often mine them with a graphics card at a profit. Some even allow you to be paid in Bitcoin even though you are farming an altcoin.

I guess you mean Craig Wright? Don't think many people believe his claim since he didn't provide conclusive evidence (moving the genesis stash). Most community leaders see SegWit as the forward, the BU crowd consists mostly of Chinese miners as far as I know, but I could be wrong. To be honest I've never seen a compelling, well-written and comprehensive argument for why SegWit shouldn't be activated.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:44:49
If you big blockers would just upgrade to SegWit we wouldn't have these problems.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:28:04
I was honestly expecting the price to continue going up so I thought I might as well take in some extra profit. Plus I thought that I could stomach a 2-3% drop so I wasn't worrying about it too much.
I was gonna get called at about $1080/BTC on Kraken so I'm glad the price did a 180 before then.

Hey, if I have 1 BTC stored on an exchange and I take out a buy order for 1 BTC before the ETF announcement, and the ETF gets approved and I then sell my BTC for a higher price do I end up with more than 1 BTC on my exchange credit or is it the same as leaving 1 BTC on an exchange account?

To make more money obviously, but I wouldn't consider it unless you are willing to spend dozens of hours reading whitepapers and browsing forums. If you don't have any knowledge about what you are investing in then you will most likely end up losing money.
In your situation I would advise you to store your Bitcoins safely and keep adding to them whenever you can afford. You won't get rich by next year doing it this way, but you might be in 10 years from now without taking a big risk or spending vast amounts of time on research.

You should NEVER use a Trezor (or other hardware wallet) that has been removed from the box before you received it. If you store any BTC on this device then you are opening yourself up to losing your future wealth to an infected wallet.

This is probably the closest you can get to absolute proof that no one but a very vocal minority has any trust in BU. Cue the paid trolls presenting this huge price drop and lack of confidence by the market as something positive for Bitcoin. 
You know what would happen if SegWit got activated? People would trip over their god damn feet to buy more coins. Not only would this trend be reversed, it would have risen even quicker than the price fell.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:07:08
I guess it doesn't. It's just the idea of giving a quarter Bitcoin to someone you don't know that seems insane to me. Most people here believe that Bitcoin will surge to 100x or more of it's current value some day so I would imagine that makes it even less likely.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:13:03

Stop losses fuck you over, that's my experience at least. Lost 200 dollars once because a few assholes decided to sell their coins 2% below market value, triggering my stop loss, after which the actual value continued to rise.
During the SEC announcement I was leveraging a long position on Bitcoin, but managed to sell all my coins at around $1225 dollars because I was quick enough to have my market order fulfilled after I heard the news. Did everything manually and came out on top, even though I was betting on SEC approval. Only wish I had bought back in at $1000 instead of $1150 because I waited for that dip that never came.

Wilders didn't do as well as some had hoped in the Dutch elections and the current ruling party will be able to keep their position if they form a new coalition. Bitcoin thrives from economic and political instability however, so that's what affected the price most likely.

Auto reject because Bitcoin will still be unregulated by March 30th. Ditto for the other outstanding ETF. Either there are going to be some groundbreaking changes in the way Bitcoins are traded or Bitcoin will forge ahead without the US governments stamp of approval.

Nobody offers PayPal transactions because you can easily charge back your money and keep the Bitcoins. Try Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase or another exchange to buy some coins. If you only want to buy $10 you could look for an ATM near you and buy it from there to avoid registration with an exchange.

It doesn't matter that they're not a G20 country. This election was a blowback to the right after it just secured an important election and a referendum.

Nobody can say for sure. March 11 is the date that the first Bitcoin ETF will be approved or rejected. This will have a huge impact on the price.

What do you mean aren't they all the same thing?
How can consumer goods, assets and investments be the same thing?
Consumer goods are affected comparatively little by inflation, assets are moderately affected and investments inflate heavily. 
I just wanted to point out the common misconception that "inflation is at 2%". The statement is reductivist and misleading because it only takes into account one very specific part of the economy which just so happens to be the part that is least affected by inflation, creating the impression that perceived inflation is far lower than real inflation.

It doesn't matter that you understand the risk since you're not the one affected by it. What you are doing is asking someone to potentially store their life savings on a device that someone has had the opportunity to tamper with.
Your word is not reliable when it comes to guiding someone else's financial security decisions since any skilled hacker could create a fake reddit account and post a bunch of misinformation if they were dedicated enough. And if they were skilled you wouldn't be able to notice the physical tampering either. The only thing that offers a relative degree of confidence in the device's safety is the unbroken, undamaged package that it comes in.
If someone came up to you and asked you if you would hand them your cash in exchange for lower fees than the bank you are currently storing your money at is charging you, would YOU agree and call that a sane decision? Because that is basically what you are asking people to do.

Trading Bitcoin can be a safe, reliable way to make money if you can accurately predict future events before they occur. If this does not describe you then you will most likely buy when the price is high and then panic sell when it falls. Essentially this is not very different from gambling at all.
My suggestion for you is to buy Bitcoin and hold it for a long time and not to sell whenever it looks like the price might tank. Buy a little bit of Bitcoin each month and spend some extra money when the price has crashed and not yet recovered. If Bitcoin continues to survive for another 5-10 years you will get very rich doing this. 
Welcome to Bitcoin!

Mods, please sticky this! A lot of the day to day FUD that is posted on this sub could be prevented from being posted by having wallets/exchanges/fee calculators recommend reasonable fees.
Currently most of them recommend ~10x the necessary fees, with some being 100x at times. This needs to be addressed urgently because the BanksterCoin8x crowd already uses these inflated fee prices as propaganda.
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:15:00

@_date: 2017-01-17 05:54:26
First of all, Bitcoin's price increasing is a good thing, period. As the price increases, people will stop thinking about Bitcoin and start to use mBTC, microBTC and Satoshis. Even if 1 BTC were worth 1 million dollars, 1 Satoshi would only be worth 1 cent. So everyone will be able to afford Bitcoins no matter how high the price rises.
And to your second question, you could buy at 800, wait for the price to rise to 1000 and sell for 200 profit (minus ca. 5% fees). You might get lucky and the price drops back to 800 so you can buy in again and keep your profit (minus additional fees). But what if instead of dropping back down, the price rises further to 1200 instead? Do you abandon Bitcoin as a whole and keep the $200 you earned? Do you reinvest at 1200 and take a 20% (plus fee percentage) hit on your investment? Do you wait for the price to fall back down? What if it goes to 2000 instead?
This is just to give you an idea of what could potentially happen if you try to time the market. There is no way to know whether the price will increase or decrease next so you are gambling with your money. Your odds may be slightly better than if you went to a casino (no house advantage, no guaranteed manipulation), but you are still taking a large risk. If you understand the risks though, it's a valid choice to make.

"The incentive for the seller to pay the fees would be an increase in sales, therefore an increase in revenue to them."
"I say this will happen at some point, probably organically, when sellers realize that they are missing out on revenue by not incentivizing Bitcoin users to use their shop."
You've repeated a point I've already made. In order to get to a point where sellers would believe that they are missing out on revenue you still need to get to the point of larger Bitcoin adoption though. Right now Bitcoin purchases probably account for less than 1% of all transactions on sites that support Bitcoin. With so few people using it, sellers won't even bother thinking about incentivizing users, much less make actual changes to their payment systems.

What incentive are you offering the seller in exchange for paying the transaction fees themselves? Higher Bitcoin adoption isn't gonna be good enough for them. Businesses care about profits first, second and third so you would have to find a way to convince them that they would be better off financially if they paid the fees than if they didn't. That isn't going to happen, at least not right now.
I know what your thinking, many sellers pay the PayPal fees for their buyers (although not all). The reason for that is that PayPal has a giant adoption base though, far far larger than Bitcoin's at this point in time. Here's where the problem comes in. You want to convince the sellers to pay the Bitcoin transaction fees to encourage more Bitcoin adoption, but in order to be able to convince them to do so, Bitcoin needs to have a much larger adoption base.
I say this will happen at some point, probably organically, when sellers realize that they are missing out on revenue by not incentivizing Bitcoin users to use their shop. But we still have a long way to go until then.

What argument is ridiculous? That HDDs will not function for eternity? Or that miners will not push for a higher blocksize? I don't know which of these assumptions is more outlandish. 
Who are these people you're talking about? I sent a transaction yesterday with the fee set at $0.45 and got confirmed in 10 minutes. If people are paying $4-$5 now they are overpaying and they would still be paying $4-$5 if the blocksize were set to 8MB cause miners would spam the mempool until they can complain about blocks being too small again.

That argument would make some amount of sense if you assumed that HDDs don't require any maintenance and will never break down. You also assume that if we implement an 8MB blocksize on Bitcoin, miners won't ever demand another increase. These assumptions are incorrect. Once the blocksize is raised to 8MB, the network will be spammed, miners will claim it's organic growth, demand 32MB blocks and the whole process begins anew.

This is a useful reminder. Additionally to the points you've made it is also important to note that the more coins are stored on an exchange, the greater the negative effect when an exchange is hacked not only for its users, but for the Bitcoin community at large because time has shown that investors lose confidence in the currency itself and rush to sell their holdings, driving the value of Bitcoin down.
In other words, transfer your money off the exchanges people!
@_date: 2016-11-19 22:43:10
Expansions are usually announced about a year or so before they are released and release dates tend to be accurate. The problem is that the gold price doesn't instantly adjust upon release and then settle until the next the next expansion comes out, but the price remains kind of in a limbo for a month or longer until gold farmers figure out the best routines for aquiring gold so in that period you really won't know for sure how much your gold is gonna devaluate. The only thing you know for sure is that it will devaluate by some amount. 
Adding to this are big content patches that could potentially introduce better gold farming routes and drive the price further down, but then again they may not so it becomes really unpredictable at that point.
In my opinion, unless you are a committed WoW player, it would be risky to rely on gold for remittances because you there is no way for an outsider to understand the system fully. In fact, I'd even say it might be impossible as a player unless you farm gold yourself.

@_date: 2016-11-17 23:38:23
The division system of the dollar is actually much closer to that of Bitcoin than either one of them are to gold. 
One dollar can be divided into 100 subunits, the amount of which is more or less arbitrary as it is not tied to any physical property. The same goes for Bitcoins, only that instead of 100 subunits, it can be divided into 100 million subunits. Again this number was chosen arbitrarily and does not relate to any physical properties of the currency itself.
Gold on the other hand, is measured purely based on the same physical measurements with which we also measure all other physical elements, called units of mass. Gold is almost infinitely divisible from kilos, to grams, to milligrams, micrograms, nanograms all the way to yoctograms. This system of division was not specifically created for gold and therefore sets it apart from both Bitcoin and the US Dollar. In fact this means that dividing Bitcoin in a similar way to USD actually makes a lot more sense than dividing it similarly to Gold.

Basically there's nothing preventing Bitcoin from having lower transaction fees if everybody was willing to push in that direction and accept the drawbacks that come with it. 
As far as I understand it, you would only need to increase the Blocksize by a few multiples of itself and you could have no to almost no transaction fees. 
The problem is that this would make mining far less profitable and unsustainable for most individuals which would result in a centralization of the Bitcoin network in the hands of a few super wealthy people. Most people, (including me), think that this goes against the fundamentals of what Bitcoin set out to accomplish in the first place and therefore prefer to pay a few more fees in return for a mostly decentralized system.
However, things like SegWit can achieve lower transaction fees and higher speeds without many of the negative effects of a Blocksize increase and is expected to go into full force at some point next year.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:18:22
Don't mind me, just securing my place on the guestlist.
@_date: 2016-11-15 02:38:55
Exactly, an actual block size increase would just lead to mining operations being being concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy people and Bitcoin would become more and more centralized as a result.

@_date: 2016-12-05 15:07:20
Let's imagine you do get rich by holding 0.03 BTC. 1 BTC would be worth, say, 30 million dollars, making your holdings worth a little less than a million bucks. 
That's probably enough to live on for the rest of your life if you're being somewhat frugal. 
Now let's imagine you had spent a little over 700 bucks instead of 20. In the same scenario as above you would now own 30 million dollars instead and could probably fulfill every one of your wildest dreams and have enough money to leave your offspring too. 
Think about it, would you really want Bitcoins price to shoot up now to unimaginable heights while you hold so little? Right now is the only time when average joes will be able to buy an entire Bitcoin with significantly less than a month's wage. 
You will regret your decision to invest only a child's allowance far more if Bitcoin's price "blows up" than if it became worthless and yet that's the scenario you're hoping for.

Congratulations, you've actively contributed to keeping these hackers in business then.

But if you do follow your plan you will most likely still be a lot better off than if you hadn't.

I agree that 0.1 Euros for sending 1 Euro is very high, but people sending 1 Euro is not going to what most people do, those are fringe cases. And yes you are a bad teacher because you might as well have sent 50 Euros back and forth between each other and the fee still would have been only 10 cents at which point I'm sure your friend would have felt differently about the technology. Or you could have explained to him that fees are only high when you send tiny amounts of money.
If fees stay at 0.1 Euros forever I don't think it would keep Bitcoin from mass adoption.

If Bitcoin has 10x its current number of transactions, that means the network is about 10x more valuable which means that more miners will come online to secure the network. This still doesn't mean that the energy is wasted, it is making the network more resistant to a hostile takeover. Most of the power used in mining comes from hydroelectric dams meaning power consumption is not an issue.

I never said they should sell BTC at the same price they acquire them, they're running a business and not a charity after all. 
But if you think they are selling the BTC for the minimum price that still turns them a profit and that lack of competition from other ATMs doesn't factor into the their decision making then you are mistaken. My comment wasn't supposed to imply that these operators are greedy and immoral, I just meant that they were operating like any sensible business would by leveraging the lack of competition in their field.

Are you deliberately ignoring the point I'm trying to make? More energy consumed equals a higher level of security for the network.

@_date: 2017-11-24 15:50:15
The difference in price is most likely due to extra fees on the ATM. Since there is usually little competition on the ATM scene, vendors like to hike their fees for extra profit.

Sharing (part of) your recovery seed with someone is bad security practice. It doesn't matter how much you love or trust them or whether you're convinced that you will stay together for the rest of your lives. By sharing your seed you introduce the potential for future conflict. 
My advice to you is to make 2 new seeds for you and your loved one each, never tell the other where you hide it and maybe each transfer over an agreed upon amount of money to your shared seed for shared expenses if that's how you handle your regular financial transactions too.

False, Litecoin hasn't activated SegWit yet. However, it is only a few days away from locking it in, but Chinese pool owners could still go back on their word. ViaLTC (ViaBTC) has quadrupled its hashrate over the last 24 hours to 4.2% and is NOT signalling SegWit.
Bottom line: If SegWit is locked in and activated, the price will go a lot higher than it is now.

LN without SegWit would be a bit messy and create its own set of problems that devs would have to work around and dedicate resources to. It wouldn't be as efficient either. That's why devs are currently holding out on implementing it, they would prefer SegWit activation first.

Definitely do a lot of research before you decide to use certain markets on the Deep Web. You should know what kind of footprint you are leaving online, how transactions can be traced back to your physical address or linked to your real identity. This involves studying the tools you use to mask your online identity and presence, the trade platform you will be using, the seller's reputation and what kind of currency you will be using and how you aquire it. Bitcoin is NOT anonymous by default which a lot of people don't understand, but it's very important to recognize this before you take risks online.

You're right about not putting it in a bank for the reason you mentioned. The best practice would be to engrave the private key on flame resistant metal, and then hide that piece of metal somewhere it won't be stumbled upon. Putting it in a heavy tresor with a keypad is probably the safest option here.

Because people at certain times will want to exchange their deflating currency for highly desired items, land or properties as they have done for several millenia of human history before the abolishment of the gold standard in the 1970s.
Not only are you implying that human trade and barter didn't exist before the 70s, your statement additionally suggests that people will never sell their stocks, bonds, land etc. for an inflationary currency like the USD because those assets are very likely going to increase in value in the future. 
Furthermore, if individuals are free to choose between a deflationary currency that is going to increase in value and an inflationary currency that will decrease in value, why would anyone willingly choose the latter? Would the majority really forego their individual benefit because of what they perceive is "best" for the economy?

You misread the article, he used a courier service to have the medicine delivered to his home in Venezuela which would not have been possible with a Venezuelan bank account.

Take a look at these 2 statistics:
The number of civilian casualties in Iraq due to US intervention is equal to and sometimes exceeds the number of civilian casualties due to acts of terrorism WORLD wide. 
If you add to that first statistic the number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan etc. then you end up with at least three times as many civilian deaths in countries  due to US intervention than the global number of terrorist casualties. And this doesn't even take into account the deaths of innocents caused by people that have joined extremist groups because of the US' interventionist policy. Who then are really the main driver of global terrorism? Or can it only be called terrorism if civilians from Western nations die?

An unstable overclock that causes artifacting might only affect your mining performance negligibly but it will most likely perform worse than the highest stable OC would. In addition, over time the artifacting might worsen and your card's overall performance could be lowered and you are setting yourself up for more maintenance due to potential crashes/freezes.
It's never a good idea to clock a GPU past its maximum stable OC irregardless of the use case I would say.

You are right in theory. However, finding a truly suitable middle ground between two extremes can be extremely difficult to achieve for the broad masses that have been deprived of education and tempted with emotional appeals. (I refer to education in the true sense of the word, not the kind that is fraught by political ideology itself.)
I simply meant that at a specific time and place in history, nationalism could have been used to the advantage of the people practicing it when their only other practical choice was to give people with unknown (but predictable) motives influence over their lives. It's by no means a perfect solution, but it might have been the most beneficial for some countries if they had managed to phase it out once it ceased to be necessary.

Nope, most if not all cloud mining schemes are designed to rip you off. Just type in cloud mining in the search bar to read stories from hundreds of people who have lost much of their initial investment by the end of their cloud mining contracts.
Operating a mine yourself only makes sense when you have a lot of capital to invest in equipment or great mining conditions (cheap energy, cheap cooling) or both. In most cases, the best returns are had by simply buying and holding Bitcoins over a long period of time.

I'm not against UASF either (I would actually prefer it), but I believe SegWit + additional non-witness 2MB increase  would get the necessary support quicker. Either way, if there is sufficient support for BIP148 then you can count me in.

What happened to this sub? All of a sudden people start treating Technical Analysis like it's a magical crystal ball when before most saw it for what it was, I.e. a scam.
I assume it's lots of newcomers trying to apply their general knowledge of stocks and funds to Bitcoin, but here's the thing: Bitcoin doesn't behave like the stock market does. 
And when Bitcoin finally does swing against this trend, a lot of people are gonna get burned and buy back a fraction of the Bitcoins they had before.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:51:36
Very true. I use Bitcoin to hedge against general economic uncertainty and a potential stock market crash. I first invested @ $500 per BTC and reaching $2k does indeed feel like a huge milestone.

There's a difference in price per BTC because demand and supply differ between exchanges. If you want to take advantage of this situation, which is called arbitrage, you first buy Bitcoins for cheap on exchange X and then transfer and subsequently sell them for higher at exchange Y. As you keep doing this the prices of the two exchanges will eventually converge, thereby eliminating the arbitrage opportunity.
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:18:02
Yeah, if it ever drops down that low again it would be a fantastic chance to invest. There's a good chance it won't ever drop that far down again though, it's your call to decide if you want to take that risk. The potential long term value is far higher than either $1250 or $1900.

If you look at the Bitcoin price chart from the beginning, one pattern that stands out is that every time Bitcoin reaches a significant ATH (All time high) and subsequently drops in value, the maximum value at the height of the bubble is the lowest price Bitcoin will trade for after it establishes the next noteworthy ATH.
Since the last significant ATH in 2013 peaked at ~$1250 we will never see Bitcoin go lower than that again if this 8 year old trend continues.

You answered your first question correctly yourself, you're fine to hold on to it until you have set up a wallet. However, you need to pay for your Trezor with Bitcoins so you might want to set up a temporary wallet just to make that first payment. (Don't buy a second-hand Trezor because it could have been tampered with)
As to your second question, Trezor will ask you to set up a mnemonic seed (24 words) that you can use to restore your Trezor wallet balance to ANY wallet of your choosing. So as long as you keep your seed there is no risk of you losing your Bitcoins even if Trezor goes bankrupt the same day after you set up your wallet.

Currently, proposal support is measured by the amount of hashpower you add to the mainnet. Using your idea, Core would have to design ASICs far more powerful than Bitmain's (powerful enough to drop the non-SegWit signalling pools to &lt; 5%) and sell these to tens of thousands of Bitcoin users who then, in addition, need to supply these ASICs with power until SegWit locks in. The first problem with this is that Core is a group of individuals, none of whom are wealthy enough to fund R&amp;D, production costs, storage and distribution of these machines.

You are welcome, I'm always willing to help newcomers understand how Bitcoin works and how to acquire them :)
Your plan seems good to me although I would suggest using a different website than Coinbase for the initial transfer as CB has had frequent crashes and long wait times for transactions since the last price run up. 
If you are using a Desktop, I suggest you use Electrum and for an Android device I would use Mycelium. Neither of these wallets require you to give out any of your personal information because there's no registration involved, they work out of the box.
Mycelium even allows you to import your Trezor wallet and manage it from within the app alongside non-protected wallets, but still requires you to connect your Trezor when you wish to transfer founds away from your Trezor-backed wallet. You can always view your address and balance from Mycelium even if you don't connect the Trezor.
Other than this, I would say you are good to go!

The official start of signalling is supposed to take place on July 21st. In addition, there are still 3 remaining activation periods (3 x 336 blocks) after the current one. Finally, even below 80% signalling there is a chance of the activation to occur due to the variance in finding blocks.
On a sidenote, there is of course a chance that miners will stop signaling and pull support to manipulate the market, especially before the last activation period has begun.

However, we could then get into a discussion over what constitutes being "caught". Having one of your emails publicised on the Internet that links your identity to a drug purchase most certainly constitutes being caught in my opinion. You could argue that it you aren't caught until the police become officially involved, but at that point you are creating a blanket excuse for law enforcement to decide which crimes to investigate and which they can choose to ignore which would bring us back to my original argument. That is, unless you are suggesting that law enforcement doesn't doesn't have the resources to read through a bunch of emails and confirm their validity.

Hey there, you seem to be very new to Bitcoin. First of all, the whole idea behind Bitcoin is to be your own bank so that you don't have to trust anyone else with your money. To that end, you should look into downloading a wallet like Electrum (PC) or Mycelium (Android) and possibly a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger if you want to store large amounts of money.
The best way to acquire Bitcoin is through an ATM where you can pay with cash or through an exchange where you can either wire the money or pay from a bank account. Nobody accepts PayPal because of how easy it is for sellers to get scammed and I haven't heard of any sellers accepting PaySafe Card, but I might be wrong on that.
Good luck and welcome to Bitcoin!

With that graphics card you're not gonna get great returns. A 1080 Ti will net you about $3-4 per day (or $1.50 - 2 if you only run 12 hours per day). There's slight differences in payout between alts, but nothing too big. 
I estimate that with your current setup you would probably earn $0.70 per day max.
Bear in mind though that if Bitcoin's value increases, the value of your already mined coins will also increase by the same percentage.

Potentially yes, but it requires additional effort in setting up and verifying accounts at multiple exchanges and after that there is still the risk that the price differences will have normalized or even reversed by the time your transfer goes through.
IMO this is a risky strategy only worth pursuing if the  price difference is large (i.e. &gt; $30/BTC).

You're not clueless for agreeing with Trump about the NYT being garbage.

You can't determine the byte size on its Euro or Dollar value, it is completely independent of that. It has more to do with the origins of the BTC amount you are trying to send. Every competent wallet will tell you how many bytes are contained within the transaction you want to send and also recommend a fee amount based on the byte size. Careful though as the majority of wallets will calculate an amount that can be 10x higher than it needs to be.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:42:11
On a KYC exchange, 100€ will net you ~0.038 at the moment (fees included) although this varies from exchange to exchange. If you want anonymous coins  you would probably need to pay another ~10% in extra fees if you had access to an ATM. 
However, the Bitcoin price varies from country to country and even places like South Korea can have a premium of &gt; 50% due to increased demand/limited supply.
You could always buy non-anonymous coins, transfer them to a privacy based alt coin, clean them and transfer back to BTC although you would also incur fees if you did this. (This would still amount to less than the premium you mentioned though).
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:29:00
Bitcoinfees21 is a completely unreliable source of information as they always recommend a fee far higher than would be necessary. Many, if not most, popular wallets suffer from the same inaccurate fee calculations as Bitcoinfees21 and should therefore not be viewed as reliable indicators.

@_date: 2017-06-04 01:59:22
Because the amount of BTC that is transacted is irrelevant to the size of the fee that should be included with it. If you had sent 500 BTC the same ~$2 fee would have been sufficient as well. (Assuming the same number of inputs and outputs)
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:12:07
RBF can't come fast enough. Mycelium's fee estimation is far too high and usually even the cheapest option is 2x-4x higher than it has to be. Alternatively, a manual fee entry option would be great too.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:17:32
No, you paying the Coinbase fee means that you basically hired Coinbase to pay the miner fee themselves, that is the purpose of the fee.
You need to provide us with the exact transaction on the blockchain and a screenshots of your Coinbase transaction history so people can figure out what happened here. 
To be honest though, this problem requires someone more knowledgeable than myself to figure it out.
Edit: Looks like the person below me has figured it out.

Fees are way down (&lt;50 sat/byte) and alternatively you can just make one lump transfer to your Steam wallet and spend from that.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:08:08
There is no official exchange that will let you use PayPal to purchase Bitcoin and most private sellers won't accept it either. The reason for this is that it would be incredibly easy for someone to purchase BTC with PayPal, wait for the transaction to be confirmed and then do a chargeback of the PayPal transaction. Since BTC transactions are irreversible, the seller would be left with no Bitcoin and no money.
If you don't have access to a bank account you can always pay with cash at a Bitcoin ATM or with a local seller.

You can't argue with ETH shills. In their eyes Vitalik is the ultimate demi god who cares only about the larger ETH community and would never act in a selfish way. Therefore it's ok for him to have ultimate control over the network that allows him to inflate the token count at will and take away anyone's tokens if he doesn't like them.

It's been pumping like crazy over the last year without actually having any of the infrastructure that BTC has. There are no ETH ATMS, no country has formally recognized ETH, it's controlled by a single actor, its network isn't immutable, there's no limit on inflation, you basically have to own BTC to aquire ETH etc.

Most US exchanges have KYC/AML requirements so the IRS will now exactly what's up if you use those.

Blockfolio is an Android app that allows you to do just this. You can track and add any cryptocurrency to your portfolio and have it update constantly.

You can input that mnemonic into any wallet that supports 24 word mnemonic seeds (which most wallets do). So pretty much any wallet you can download from the web or app store or whatever. You don't need a Trezor device for that at all. Think of it as a failsafe mechanism.

I didn't mean to discourage you from investing into Bitcoin, I just wanted to point out that technical analysis is a bad reason for doing so. Look at the underlying tech, read the whitepaper, examine the already existing infrastructure that has been created to support it and then ask yourself whether you believe that Bitcoin will still be around in a few years from now and how much value it could possibly gain over that period. Those answers should determine whether you invest and how much. 
That's only my two cents though.

If you have 1 Bitcoin on wallet X and 0 Bitcoin on wallet Y and you decide to send 1 BTC from wallet X to Y you will end up with 0 Bitcoin on wallet X and 1 Bitcoin on wallet Y.
Otherwise you would be able to multiply your own BTC holdings by transferring back and forth between wallets.

What those charts are attempting to do is predict the future. Ask yourself how seriously you should take them.

Hear hear. Finally we get some reasonable posts on this sub again after the Technical Analysis/FUD shitshow that plagued this sub over the last few weeks. Know that you are not alone in your thinking.

You should use an actual exchange like Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken or Coinbase. Never heard anyone recommend the website you mentioned on this sub so I can't guarantee that it's safe. After you purchased your Bitcoins, you might want to transfer you coins to a private wallet like Mycelium or Electrum.

Sorry for the confusion. KYC stands for Know Your Customer and is a legal requirement placed by the state on exchanges to force them to identify their customers and keep records of their identity in case the customers engage in illegal activities.
Most exchanges operate on this principle because they have to by law. Examples include Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinbase etc. . You can choose any of these exchanges to buy Bitcoin, but you have to make sure that it is possible to become a customer there from within your own country. Some exchanges only allow you to register there if you have an American bank account, but there are alternatives.
Once you have purchased your coins from an exchange you can then follow the steps I outlined above to cut the link between your identity and your personal Bitcoin stash so that you have fully anonymous coins.

Like when that other guy took out a $200k loan to go all in on Bitcoin at $1800/BTC? No?
Please stop talking out of your ass.

If you want to buy BTC at a KYC exchange then expect to pay anywhere between 1.5 - 4% in fees. Anonymous ATM transactions can be more expensive. And yes, it's usually cheaper to do one transaction instead of multiple ones, but if you are new to Bitcoin it might make sense to start with a small amount. (10, 120 would be cheaper than 40, 40, 50)

If you want to be absolutely safe, you should generate a new seed.

It hasn't happened on Litecoin and there's an easy $2mm+ target for attackers that was made public.
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:18:13
Hmm, I'm not sure I can help you with that, sorry. Hopefully someone who uses Coinbase can chime in.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:15:40
Short answer: Yes.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:17:38
Pretty much, yeah.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:48:57
No, you are uninformed about the current appropriate fee level. I've had multiple transactions confirm within 10 minutes using a $0.50 fee. You cannot argue with facts. If you took the time to try a low fee transaction you would know.
You believe that fees are up to $7 because you and others are willing to pay such ridiculous amounts when it isn't necessary at all.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:26:51
Easily, I agree. In that case the price would be in multi million dollar range after 10 years.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:09:30
Far later than once hits $10k, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:43:38
I have the same feeling about this rally. A $2700 coin will be a bargain by next week.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:58:16
Receiving is always free, but Coinbase charges a static withdrawal fee.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:18:03
Not after they introduced ads with the last update. Used to be a good choice though.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:23:15
Mycelium, Electrum or Breadwallet. Take your pic, all three of these come highly recommended.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:23:54
$0.50 transaction fees that get confirmed within 10 minutes for transactions up to billions of dollars = Bitcoin is dead.
Alright, calm down son.

This was the last straw for me. SegWitX2 is basically a ploy to protect Asicboost.
UASF or bust!

Nice straw man you have there. How is Bip148 related to the US government? The point of UASF is to reject all forms of external governance.

Prominent predictions from economists/investors state that the next ten years will bring Bitcoin's value anywhere from $100k - $1mm+.

Yesterday I think, I just updated a few hours ago and there they were. No option to turn them off.

You will be able to buy canned food and AKs with Bitcoin, along with pretty much everything else so it's a better investment than stockpiling those supplies. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:55:47
"You're wrong" is not a convincing argument. Try giving some reasons for your beliefs next time so people will take you seriously. Name-calling doesn't lend your argument more credibility either.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:59:40
Can we please stop mentioning this irrelevant person? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:16:22
Since you want to hold long term, absolutely, now is a good time to buy, just not as good as yesterday. Who knows where the new ATH will be established?
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:33:36
That statement makes no sense.
