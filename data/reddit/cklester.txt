Why do you say "next to impossible?" Is it somehow, even remotely possible?

For anonymity, I suspect it's not enough to create a throw-away wallet, then transfer from there to your primary wallet, as that step is recorded on the blockchain? So, then, how can anonymity be achieved at all, if every transaction is recorded? Even if I have no personal information in my wallet, all I have to do is spend that money and I'm now identifiable on the blockchain. Right?
My concern with anonymity is, once the US makes bitcoin illegal, and transacting in BTC illegal, I don't want to be caught, because I won't obey that particular law. I'm all about liberty, and no government is going to tell me how I can or cannot transact business. Of course, BTC is way to technological to survive a SHTF scenario, so maybe, for now, gold/silver is better pocket change...?
If there are 21 million units of BTC, that means there are 21 million million satoshis! I wonder how many US cents exist right now. Is it more or less than 21 million million? The good thing about BTC is that once they're all made, no more will be made. The problem with FRNs is that there is no "they're all made." They can always print more, to the detriment of what already exists.

I don't see how any government could "kill" bitcoin, except by massive legislation and regulation efforts, all of which could easily be bypassed by unregulated, private, and anonymous networks.
I want BTC to work because it frees us [from fiat currencies and, therefore, centralized manipulation of the economy by an elite few].
