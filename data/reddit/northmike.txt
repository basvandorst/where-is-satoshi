Good. Maybe we can cut the rich down to size in a generation or two.

Banks still use checks. Any improvement is good.

The kind of greed and volatility we see in the market is what prevents geeks like me from even thinking about introducing this to mainstream users. It will be years still. This is a "techie" change means nothing to most people.

I like anything banks do not like. Period. If its bad for them, its likely good for me...

I went there expecting to find a bunch of channels. Instead it was a page for setting up a stream. How can this service be any good if it lost me in the first 3 seconds? For now I will stick to Veetle. If this ends up having content I may take another look.

Putting someone like that in prison is like having the government function as a headhunter for organized crime syndicates.

What about the billionaires and their government armies? Won't they interfere?
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:56:25
That's cool. Makes it easier for foreign companies to compete.

Somebody's care package arrived in the mail! LOL

Just like the Internet itself, they allowed small companies and anyone at all to be ISP's, then the big companies bought market share by offering you cheaper faster service. Now the independent companies are gone and the public is concentrated into a handful of networks run by elites. Bitcoin must penetrate the market place. Interfering won't help. I am convinced the blockchain is the perfect means to track people however. But only to a certain level. If you bounce currency around enough surely that loses them but who can say? Not me.

If there are 2 systems in need of peaceful replacement, banks are one, system of government is the other.

I missed out. I always do. Thats why im poor.

As you may have noticed, older people have a real hard time learning or accepting new information. May as well market to the kids.

Only if its able to remain decentralized. Nobody wants money controlled by a heavily armed militaristic government anymore. Frankly, its just to important to be trusted to politicians and easily bought off decision makers.

The moment government takes over, Bitcoin becomes of no interest. The whole point at least for me, is to intentionally undermine the central banking and systems. They have been a tool for oppression and control for far to long.

sssshhhhhhhhhhh don't help them!
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:10:31
They love the technology but cannot control or rig it very well so they want to make their own version?

This is likely how you MANUFACTURE Domestic Terrorism.

Should be interesting watching how American greed will drive the Bitcoin industry into other countries. There can be no major innovation in America without the Oligarchs slapping it down. Bitcoin needs its own government and nuclear armed army to realize its true potential. In other words it needs a Nuclear Power as a state sponsor, and one that does not bend to western pressure. Maybe China or Russia is the best nation to be the safe go to zone for crypto?

US Congress is the saddest thing I know of on our continent... With the parliament of Canada being a close second.

My bank has had that for as long as I can remember. I've paid my bills online for well over a decade. Instant enough when the bill is paid within 24hrs every time.
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:38:30
Pretty sure that box I buried is just as safe. /jk

Its tradition. In America its traditional for any highly successful person, industry, or business to purchase laws, policies, and regulations from the government via special interest lobbying. Most citizens fail to understand that government in the USA is a business, and the product is legislation. America is a business. So once an industry matures, as is the way of greed, all steps are taken to prevent others from rising up successfully to become a competitive challenge. This is traditional and happens with every disruptive industry or new technology.

If I had a bunch of Bitcoin, I to could have this problem, and even sympathize. But I do not. So I cannot sympathize. So there. Smoke that.

Nope. He is just duping single issue fools into thinking he is...

Was inevitable. Any new form of wealth redistribution or disruptive technology always catches the eyes of our rulers. Especially when it can be disruptive to business and trade. They want their cut, and they will get it, they always do.

Makes sense. Just like Domains. In fact, maybe we can connect bitcoin to a domain somehow?
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:19:41
Probably just someone with massive BTC wanting to drive up prices so they can dump. One article in a physically printed newspaper out of one of the most corrupt cities on earth is hardly anything to get excited about.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:21:04
Its a scam. Someone with lots of coin is trying to drive up prices for a sell off, probably because prices have stagnated as of late and they want to invest in something else.
