thank you, it's not rude. so you are saying fiat money systems are actually not as bad as people say on here?
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:53:35
So it's only Chase so far right? And do you think this is really all because Bitcoin? I mean it could be, but if it is the banks must really see a threat because this is extremely preemptive given that not that many people use that feature to buy bitcoins i think.

Ok, well in your case we'll call it a promise :)
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:29:52
that's true. i didn't think of it like that. i guess just let them figure it out on their own.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:42:58
Thank you.
So if they are working for transaction fees, then these transaction fees will be in the new blocks that come out every 10 minutes?
If the 49% ignore the chain and move on, then the 51% will have the only chain recognized by the system though right?
I will check out the link, thank you!!

you think because it's a meme it won't go anywhere? that's what i thought until i saw the community and accomplishments it's made. in a practical sense it's just as good as bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-01 04:18:28
i think this is a good next step. i know bitcoin is in it's infancy still, and i think it's biggest problem is it does take someone who knows about computer somewhat to not only have an idea of how it works but also to know how to secure themselves even a little bit and back up etc, or even spend them with that little box, like i've been into bitcoin for a while but i still don't know how to spend it with my phone or how to have a box that has my address on it come up on my cell phone.
i'm rambling a little bit, but my point is good work i think this could be the next step in bitcoin. Thanks!

@_date: 2014-02-08 04:36:23
Hey, That's where I get lost, "They could prevent transactions of their choosing from gaining any confirmations" - If their only upper hand is hashing faster than 51% of people hashing, then how do they prevent transactions?? wouldn't the 49% of people end up confirming those transactions?
And, how would they be able to control the ledger at will? "they would have full control of the network and would be able to manipulate the public ledger (blockchain) at will."
and after all bitcoins are mined, can people still do a 51% attack?
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:44:07
Thanks, Your post reminded me of my question. How can something that encrypts something not know how to decrypt it? Wouldn't the thing doing the encrypting know the formula? 
So if Person 1 sends me .02 BTC, he is using my Public key to encrypt it and my Private key automatically decrypts it and puts it in my account?
THank you!

What does "Fringe Economics" mean? I think I know what you mean but I want to be sure. If you mean unpopular economical ideologies, I think there is a large population that hold the kind of economical ideologies that many bitcoiners hold. However, the thing that will bring the rest of the people in is VERY low transaction cost, and VERY fast transacations. Vendors will love it because they aren't paying 25 cents every time you swipe your card and can charge less for their products meaning more customers, meaning more profits.

but if the phone sends the same amount to two nodes and only one will be verified, why is the legitimate one much more likely to succeed if there is no way for the miners to know which is the legitimate one? thanks man i really appreciate you explaining this stuff to me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:22:03
Since there will be 21,000,000 in existence. If it became mainstream and people used it to buy things etc, then I think you could see how if it's $1 per bitcoin, that would only leave 21 million dollars of use. And since it's global and not just in America it could reach astronomical numbers. It totally depends on if it becomes mainstream or not.

I had a teacher once, he was 72 and looked 82. He was awful at explaining things, and when he taught and you had a question he would try to answer it but it made no sense. That being said, if he taught you the wrong answer, and you wrote that answer down, then you get that answer wrong even after telling him. 
Almost everyone in that class cheated (because in hinsight that might have been one of the only ways to pass), except for me and two other students who were forced to take an extra exam due to our "low scores". The ones caught cheating were allowed to re-do it, in other words awarded another chance to get a good score on the test. 
MY POINT is, lol, he tried to explain Keynesian economics to me PLENTY of times, and I never understood what the hell he was talking about. He would drop a pen on the floor and pick it up and put it on the table and say "that's Keynesian economics". Anyways he made me do summer school at his house (this is a college course mind you), took 5-6 hours to get to his house and back by multiple trains... he gave me an A, and then tried to take it back. Mysterious old man....

Hey so I did some more reading, I guess my biggest question is how can a public key encrypt a message, and be made public to see how they encrypted it, but not give the information to decrypt it?
Here's a simple example, if the message is "my dog flies" and the public key encrypts like "m=4" "y=10" and then multiply them, etc... then why couldn't someone see that and work backwards?
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:16:39

I will tell you why I think so (I agree totally with what he said). The demand for Bitcoin now is at $700, and there are not that many people buying it now. But if (and we believe it will) Bitcoin becomes mainstream the demand will rise extremely high. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:09:26
What happened?? I thought Gox statement yesterday was that they will be back up and running and everything is fine. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:24:55
I totally disagree. Even if they don't give in, this is an issue of net neutrality along with the fact that many people have iPhones, that means Bitcoin will take much longer to become mainstream.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:30:43

@_date: 2014-02-26 12:28:41
no.. after the transaction is done that tells you that they can't double spend. after 1 confirmation someone would need millions of dollars of equipment to double spend. the  more confirmations the more diffcult it is to double spend essentially.

Isn't that an integral part of capitalism though? When people hoard stocks they think will go up because they've studied the inner workings, is this not capitalism? The hoarders are taking a risk, even according to Andreas Antonopolous who constantly says he's 100% invested in BTC but is so imprudently and suggests it to no one. Bitcoin may be over taken by a better altcoin, we are in it's infancy. 
Every time our dollar goes down it hurts the retirees, the pension holders, every time the fed prints more money.., every time the banks take a huge percentage.., every time you use your card to buy something the merchant is charged 25 cents... This is a revolution to bring competition to the banks that have almost none, bring capitalism back by pushing the banks to contribute instead of sucking everyone dry. Maybe banks can start actually holding money instead of using it to invest and when they lose being bailed out. Capitalism doesn't thrive off riskless investments and that's what these banks are doing, and they are using our money to put into stocks that if they fail they just get bailed out. Not to mention what this could do around the world.

I didn't say it  would topple other companies, I said it would take banks out as price gouging middle men. When bitcoin charges a fraction of a penny per transaction the car companies are going to have a lot of competition to match.
That's interesting that you said the black and white thing because I was thinking the same about you. Wanting to leave the community because people in the Btc community are mad that Apple is removing the bitcoin app with no explanation.Anyways maybe I'm misunderstanding you.

But cards rob you blind with fees. You don't notice it but the vendors are paying about 25 cents just to swipe your card, and guess who is paying that 25 cents.. it's incorporated in the price of what we buy. So even people who pay cash are sharing that cost.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:49:58

People could use banks where you pay them to hold your money OR choose to invest it. Instead of giving it to banks who actually don't have your money, they are investing it themselves and taking the majority of the earnings, unless they lose then the government pays. Capitalism without risk isn't capitalism. These banks can't lose, just like all the companies bailed out in 2009.
"Card companies" sir... it's called a typo.
How about you tell me which restriction disqualifies bitcoin app, and allows dogecoin app at the same time. (and your idea of why Apple decided to not tell us which rule was violated, as this is very big news to a lot of people. i saw an interview with the developer they ddin't even tell him.)
"They react like a bunch of spoiled teenagers when something doesn't go exactly their way." - I just disagree, if you are fighting for something important, like America, which many believe we are, then kicking up dust is not only expected it's well justified. A lot of problems could be fixed with Bitcoin.

So a public key will encrypt (aka hash) the e-mail contents into a fixed number code by some algorithm, So person 1 then sends the encrypted message to Person 2 who will use her public key to encrypt the encrypted message and send it back to Person 1. Then Person 1 will use their private key to decrypt that part of the encryption and send it back having only an encryption from her which she can now open because she has her private key.
I get that, but if e-mails are sent in plain text how come they aren't intercepted all the time?
Thanks so much!

@_date: 2014-02-09 11:10:15
How do you do that thing with the line next to the comments you are responding to?
In response to: "My mention of one transaction/move I've made is not an indicator of my intentions with BTC, let alone enough to generalize anyone's behavior.", I got that impression from your earlier comment: "The last 24-48 hours have truly made me rethink my involvement in the community." and "The visceral, childish reaction to the removal of blockchain.info's app is what is making me rethink my involvement with the community", is what gave me an indication with your "intentions with BTC". You clearly stated it. I wasn't even criticizing you, I was saying many people think it's revolutionary and Apple was Very wrong to take it off their site. They didn't offer a reason and I think tha'ts also very telling. How am I thinking in black and white? My ears are open if you have a reason for defending Apple's reason to take it off and if you make a good point I will take that into consideration but you offered nothing.
You're opinion can be to sit back and not buy a product if you are upset at a decision, others will raise hell especially if that messes with Net Neutrality which is a serious issue. So why do you pass it off as whining?? I don't see it.

i'd say this guy has a bit of a gambler's affliction with it, but rctid has commented several times about it being a gamble in general and i was more responding to him particularly.

The way they describe the problem sounds an awful lot like what this guy did to a very small nube company. If it is the same thing (I hope an experienced Shibe can determine this) then I would have to guess MtGox is lying because they couldn't be stupid enough to be duped by such an easy scam, that already gained public knowledge.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:28:48
My guess would be that banks see Bitcoin as a threat. If Bitcoin really goes mainstream they wouldn't make 25 cents when you use your card anymore, you would be paying bitcoin a fraction of a penny instead.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:56:03

Yes, they violated one of Apples many many rules. And so did many apps, but they are still up. They particular picked out Bitcoin because it is seen as a threat.

Why do you have to send them to a new wallet to use it as a paper wallet? If you have the private key and public key and then delete the online wallet, there won't be any way for people to find the keys after it's deleted and you have them on a piece of paper in a safe place. or am i totally wrong? lol thank you!

an exchange is a bank? an exchange just allows you to buy/sell, it was that people left them there instead of taking them out was the problem.

if the market demands something at a certain price and you were smart enough to see there will be a demand for it in the future then isn't that fair game?

wow thank you so much. i have one more question, how did you learn all of this? i'm so interested in alt-coins, not because i think they are a good investment (which i do) but because it just is interesting to me. i started reading books on cryptography but it doesn't explain the things you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:21:04
I think there are different degrees to Libertarians. Some think the government has no place at all. Which is almost non-existent. Most think you need roads, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:02:39
True, but I guess it makes it more arguable that it wasn't them who stole it because it had been through so many wallets. Are they spreading them out between wallets or just one huge transfer each time? also how do you find this stuff out?
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:57:38
so this money they are loaning out is all virtual money, and is used by big companies to do transactions that mainly stay in the banking system the whole time? amazing. also i thought it was 15% when i learned some of this in school, it's 10% now?
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:32:57
But why would they move offices to a virtual office during this time if that was the case?
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:56:22
trust them as in they are lying to us? or trust that they haven't gone insolvent by sending more withdrawals twice than they could afford?
if it is the first one, why?

ah i see, so leaving your coins in the most popular exchange that has been around for years is the same as throwing them down on the blackjack table.. i see.. interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:22:53
dude where does all your anger come from? the fact that you're calling people nerds is actually quite odd. Bitcoin isn't a scam, the exchange was hacked apparently. it was the most trusted exchange, so you can't really blame these people for trusting it.

-Oh so it never actually reaches 21 million just keeps getting closer to it? Or once it reaches 21 million the blocks hold no bitcoins anymore?
-Maybe I don't understand enough about Mining/Hashing/Blocks to understand fully. But if I could ask, when you are mining you can actually choose which blocks to mine, and if you are hashing faster than 50% then you control it because your choice becomes the longest? And couldn't they only do this for so many blocks, not all of them because there is another 49% out there doing it? If my question sounds totally nube can you point me in the right direction to start understanding this concept?
Thank you!!

Investing is very subjective, it may seem ultra-high risk to you and not to him. But even if he did see it as ultra-high risk, there are still ultra-high risk investments, just as long as the person see's a potential for ultra-high rewards it is an investment.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:52:31
you mean people that come to hear about bitcoin as being intertwined with libertarian fringe economics? i don't think that's largely talked about. sure there is that component, but i think low transaction costs, and fast transactions will grab the ear of these people.

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:32:34
well, my definition of a high risk investment is something you think is worth investing in because the benefits outweigh the risks. like if there's a 90% chance it will fail, but if that 10% that it succeeds will make you 100 times the price then it's a good deal.
gambling is when your risk of winning is below 50%
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:11:43
right, and i think OP is kind of dreaming. but Gox was the most trusted place to put your coins. I can understand people being fooled.

Yes, a private company who in the 80's was a very inivative company and was held down by IBM who they pleaded with to not block them from the market unfairly. Now they are doing the same to Bitcoin. 
And if they are doing it because they are worried about competition in some form, then i think it's illegal.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:10:16
understood. but i have talked to a lot of people who tried to take out and mtgox wouldn't verify them or something.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:15:58
My analogy between the two was based off of the speculative potential benefits. BTC serves many functions, and that is what gives it it's value. It's extremely cheap to send, it arrives within seconds, compared to a bank you are looking at 3-5% fees and 2-3 days, not to mention lack of privacy. 
As for buying things, you will get cheaper prices as the bank won't charge store owners 25 cents every time you swipe your card. That is a ridiculous price for something that can take it's place.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:31:29
what signs?
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:02:13
did you ever think maybe you should take some coins out and put them on a paper wallet or something, or you had no reason not to trust gox? btw, i'm sure you can put some money into for the next year, i think bitcoin/altcoins will be big.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:27:46
but how do you know you will be able to withdrawal your coins? isn't that why the price is low?

i missed boat number 1, hopefully there will be more boats to come. i believe in this technology. it seems revolutionary to me. the only thing that could stand in bitcoins way is if they made a better coin that was more secure and fixed any inflationary or deflationary problems by allowing more coins. But, i don't think the number of coins will be a problem almost ever, because with 8 0's after the deciminal, and 21million, that means there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 "coins", and let's say worst case scenario the last satoshi become a penny. then the bitcoin economy would be 21,000,000,000,000.00, 21 trillion dollars. but actually for an international currency that doesn't sound like much, or does it?

Um. I have to disagree here. If someone robs you, it doesn't matter if you are a libertarian or not, you go to the police. You think Libertarians are for mob rule? If an old lady gets mugged she needs to hunt him down with a .44 caliber herself instead of calling the police?
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:28:37
I don't think you really believe that. Banks can't do whatever they want, and for good reason. They are a business in the United States and have to follow their laws. Just like how Apple was sued for trying to squash competitors in shady ways. Just because it might affect their profits they can't legally stop you from using bitcoins and their bank. 
As for online poker, the government said it was illegal, that's why the banks wouldn't allow money transfers to them, and vice versa.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:24:59
it was some guy who did it to some place i can't remember lol but here it is, someone found it 
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:30:04
But the whole point is that there is a limited number of Bitcoin. If there was a collapse in fiat money, sure the government can print everybody's money that was lost to investments in the economy that tanked. But that money isn't going to be worth much. So ya you get your money but you need to take into consideration the value. 
If you're talking about if someone robs the bank and takes your money, then yeah you have a point. Then again, Mtgox is a trading company, there may be a bank in the future for bitcoin. Mtgox is like if you had a bunch of stocks and they are tied up.

ya i argue with people on here sometimes that completely blame the user. i think it is totally understandable for people to have trusted gox.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:03:40
if you don't mind me asking, how many btc did you lose?

I'm not sure about that. I don't think it would crash though. I mean this seems like it could be the money of the future though. But for now I don't think we have to worry about fiat money crashing, at least not for a long time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:06:42
it doesn't look too good to be true. it just looks like a good investment. would you have said this about starbucks in the 90's or apple or microsoft? people who saw something that will probably expand and want to invest in it, it's that simple.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:13:31
i hear you, but just because the coin has libertarian uses doesn't mean it can't have a backed exchange someday in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:31:20
so before there are any verifications the transaction id can be changed?
"the tx id is the hash of certain parts of the transaction", i guess i'm still very nubish, i'm not sure what this means. i have a vague idea of what hashing means but what does it mean in this context?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:50:33
I might be wrong about the exact time it takes to propagate the transaction but what else didn't i understand? i pretty much said what you said there.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:47:30
You could buy Dogecoins from people on here and then put them on Cryptsy.com and trade them for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:08:23
omg, thank you so much. i really appreciate that. i'm kind of at a loss to what to say. i know you just said dogecoin is kind of a joke, but it's all i got. if you have a dogecoin wallet i can send you some dogecoins :)
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:36:04
What in the fucking gods name do they need your finger print for. You or somebody needs to ask the guy or company that manages that thing please.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:36:40
but the reason you wait depends on your goal, so after the transaction is done the chance of a double spend is almost nill so why would you wait for 6 confirmations?
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:34:58
You think Joe is paranoid? I know I am paranoid and I would have that reaction, but Joe seems like a pretty laid back dude. And the thing of him being offered free money pretty much I thought it was an interesting interaction between them as you said because it seemed a little, not rude... but almost.
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:44:46
i can't believe i never said thank you for this, sorry about that. i was just re-looking at messages. thanks so much man! +2000 doge verify

so is the 1.25 trillion number incorporating the 9m in loans or just the deposit? thanks
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:51:06
hindsight is 20/20, i don't see how it's gambling to trust a well known and most popular exchange.

You think Joe Rogan is obnoxious and not very funny? Thats the first time I heard someone say that. And how can you say he wasted Andreas time??? He explained Bitcoin to probably a million people accurately who had no idea. I think it was one of the best used times in history for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:20:09
1.) Once it reaches it's "cap" it will still pump out some to make up for lost coins etc.
2.) Dogecoin is just as good as Bitcoin in many respects.
3.) There are going to be a lot of different Cryptocurrency's, not just one. This is a revolution. It's like Visa and Mastercard. Or Silver and Gold.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:09:52
what's the difference between high risk investment and gambling?

Does trading during the day mean it will be less?

sorry, you're right.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:36:43
But if someone has the hash code can't they do the same process to get the users password as you would have to do?
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:51:54
of course, but that's how it will begin to be used to buy things. once enough people have them, businesses will want to introduce ways to use them to pay for their things.

@_date: 2014-02-10 01:57:21
I admit I used net neutrality a bit vaguely, but i think it does still apply. Apple IPhone's are computers, and net neutrality does have anti-competition components. I've heard many arguments that this is what they're doing. 
As you said, not everything is black and white, the community is merely upset that Apple is trying to squander a good thing and hopes this will bring awareness. Per your link, others that did the same thing didn't get cracked down on, and Dogecoin is still up doing pretty much the same thing. But, I you're right I never saw the article, and if the community was more worried about the truth this article might have made it up there. (Maybe it did, but I didn't see it). Anyways, nice talking to you.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:34:47
Thank you. Does freeze mean the money's still there but you can't get it or its transferred to the IRS or government's possession?
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:05:22
yes, that's what i was sayin', did i contradict myself somewhere? thanks
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:32:21
I think in the long run you're right for example my friend got pulled over in San Diego and had a med card and just picked up, and they confiscated a 1/4 oz because it was "federally  illegal", even after explaining to the officer that he was a state cop and supposed to uphold state laws, he still confiscated it and he had to go to court and eventually got it back, old and stale.... fuck that cop.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:59:32
There were 2 guys protesting that's it, u really think that's why they moved their office? Especially during this hectic time where they must have a lot of work to do.

Why would people downvote this video? Just because they don't like BTC being called S***coin??? have a little respect for the OP who took his time to post it. And like it so others can see.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:52:26
That's cool, thanks for answering my post. There was one question I had hoped would be answered by the interview, you said you used up all your money to change jobs into bitcoin a couple years ago. You must have bought up a lot of bitcoin before the boom, yet it sounded like you still need to have a job to support yourself. Did you have a lot of BTC before the boom?
Thanks again man!
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:00:32
maybe i didn't explain it well. if you have a 10% chance of success then your expected return had better be more than 1000%. So if I give 100 dollars to something that has a 90% chance of failure (i predict because you never know), then my expected return should be more than 1000 dollars. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:16:15
my understanding was that he couldn't get his USD out of gox so reinvested in BTC in order to withdrawal the BTC. Investing in BTC at this point isn't really a gamble, it's an investment. Maybe we differ in our definitions of gamble??
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:38:05
this guy is being sarcastic, read his other comments.

Man, this got me mad. You need to go to a higher up and have her reprimanded. Also, tell her... "in 10 years when bitcoin is through the roof, just remember me, and remember that 0 you gave me will just be another zero in my bank account." - i realize it doesn't make sense but it sounds good.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:39:38
What does he mean by that? What's happening to MtGox DID happen to JP Morgon, HSBC, etc in 2008.
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:56:59
I'm not doubting that they are, but maybe I've been out of the loop. Through what means of communication are they telling us this? Maybe because i'm out of the country I haven't heard it yet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:31:06
when did they turn down your verification?
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:22:48
Many of them sound like they have absolutely no knowledge of what Bitcoin is at all.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:54:39
and sorry, i should've been more specific. i moved to Japan recently, so i don't have utility bills etc to give mt gox etc to buy the coins, and coinbase (maybe because it can see my card info is from america and my ip is in japan) always deny me. so i've been buying doge on reddit but want to know if i can buy bitcoin on here too with paypal.
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:58:27
Ya from the people's comments here, it seems it's either avoiding conflicts of interest or he didn't trust the guy. I think it's probably a little of both.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:32:27
But why couldn't you withdrawal, what was their reasoning for not allowing you to withdrawal if mtgox hadn't stopped withdrawals yet i'm assuming.
oh man that sucks bro.

Ok, i had no idea people were doing that. I think and thought all speculators in bitcoin thought bitcoin is undervalued. thanks for your response.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:54:21
why would you say that to him, he was being cautious and did things by the book?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:02:47
No that's like saying rich people COULD give people who trusted their money on the most popular exchange for bitcoin and it was stolen...

@_date: 2014-02-22 16:04:34
why would they move offices during such a crucial time. seems super shady to me. but you could totally be right, that's what i was thinking before i found out they moved out of their office.

Such a catch-22... it's gonna be a blood bath. And the blood is going to be on the hands of the federal government for playing games with people's lives.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:32:57
I guess anythings possible, but can you explain how our government could do this? 
I understand how easily a third world country could do it with very harsh laws but I can't imagine America prosecuting people with such harsh penalty's for having digital coins that they went out of existence, there would still be a black market maybe.
Also it's an outright foot on our freedom and I think the people would revolt.
