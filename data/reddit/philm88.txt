You could have owned $15k worth of BTC years ago, just like you can today. The price of 1 coin doesn't really have an effect on how much you stand to lose if the value drops 90%. 90% of 15k is the same if it's in 1 coin or in loads of coins.

Time's kind of included in 'volume' I think. Ie, transactions take a long time on BTC because of the volume.

Do you have any more info on this? From what I recall, the Ripple/Stellar fellow was the founder of mt gox - but he'd sold it to an incompetent chump way before it blew up.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:55:59
Thanks for the info, makes sense.  
I got my volume figures from:  and  - had to convert the BCH volume from USD to BTC though to get a more apples-to-apples comparison.

Transfer your BTC balance from Coinbase to GDAX - which will be free because they're the same company.  
Then transfer your BTC from GDAX to whereever you want it because GDAX will cover the network fee for you. So coinbase/gdax will pay the £11 fee for you to move your £10 anywhere you want.

According to;   
357835 = BTC transactions in the last 24 hours  
45411 = BCH transactions in the last 24 hours  
So about 7.9x more transactions on BTC than BCH.    
Using the median fees from before, the BCH fee would get normalised at 0.00012928539 BCH which leaves BTC's fee as 6.7x bigger than BCH's...which as other's have said, is probably because of supply &amp; demand.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:14:28
That makes sense, thanks. I guess for the numbers to roughly add up; 1.6x the traffic would mean something like 1.6^7.5 fees. Which seems steep - but I guess makes sense; if supply remains the same, the demand curve will get steeper the more demand there is - so if there's even a small bit of extra demand, the fee's go up a lot.

IBM were pretty happy in pole-position into Microsoft stole the lead. Who'd have thought you could take over the market with IBM clones?  
Myspace were around for quite a while before someone else knocked them off their perch. Who'd have thought people would move away from a social network that already had all their friends on it, to a new and unknown network?  
  
What always was will not necessarily always be. It'd be naive to assume Bitcoin will have *any* value in the future, nevermind about keeping the top-spot in the crypto-charts.  
One thing that worries me with BTC is; it's only practical use right now is a 'store of value'. But, let's be honest - it can only store value if people believe it does. If that belief goes, the value goes with it. So let's not get complacent. The current state of transaction fees &amp; noisy opinions are chipping away at the belief already. I just hope that the belief holds out long enough for devs to make improvements, give BTC a new lease of life &amp; silence the non-believers.

This analogy is perfect with 1 small addition.  
The apartment is in an area/country that has no regulation or laws regarding landlord behaviour or liability. So your landlord has your apartment key on the same ring as his car key and he lends his car to his shady friend all the time &amp; is generally pretty irresponsible with your apartment key. Also, you don't actually know who your landlord really is.    
In such a situation, assuming there were no 'legitimate' landlords to choose from - you could mitigate your risk somewhat by changing the locks or installing an additional one that only you have a key to. There isn't an analogy for that with nicehash though - so you're unfortunately SoL and should have understood your landlord is shady, so don't keep nice things in your apartment.

I think the argument is that BCH's larger blocks are more expensive to validate &amp; store by virtue of being larger. Therefore, fewer people will be able to afford to run full nodes &amp; run the network. Fewer people running the network = more centralised.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:09
I agree that the network *could* be fine, but I don't think we can say it *will* be fine. If the couple-hundred nodes are all in China because thats the only place it's economically viable to run a node, then that's pretty centralised and the entire network can be manipulated by the Chinese government. Heck, they wouldn't even need all the nodes - just enough to swing the balance of consensus.   
Any time the number of viable nodes is decreased, or the political diversity of node host-nations is decreased or the freedom of "any one can run a node" is eroded - it's a move towards centralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:41:35
Right, so this is where I get confused with how this could actually work.  
Why would someone in the middle want to tie up their own BTC to help you transact? Particularly if it'd cost that person network fees to fund the channel in the first place and competition is intended to drive LN routing fees down.

Coinbase have their own scaling issues right now. They've probably been all-hands-on-deck trying to keep their own systems online and working during the recent flurry.  
There's not much for good for them to encourage further growth by adopting segwit if they can barely handle the current capacity.  
I would assume they are planning to jump on implementing segwit when they've made other upgrades to their systems and have done substantial testing.

Scroll to the root hints section on this page   
OSes themselves probably don't have a hard coded list of root DNS servers - the might have some vendor specific DNS servers as defaults or just rely on DHCP provided servers. But whatever servers you point your DNS to will eventually refer back to the 13 root servers.

The line between software and currency is a bit blurry for cryptocurrencies - particularly when the forks deliberately muddy the waters. Bitcoin core is software that can operate on the currency coinbase calls BTC and what this sub calls bitcoin. would say that bitcoin is what coinbase calls BCH and cannot be operated on by the bitcoin core software.  
Coinbase's naming convention of BTC and BCH is just that - coinbase's convention. Different exchanges use BCC to describe the currency coinbase calls BCH. There might even be an exchange somewhere that uses 'BTC' to describe what coinbase would call 'BCH' or something else entirely. Exchange naming conventions are inconsistent. Reddit's naming conventions are divided. The unregulated, decentralised strength of these cryptocurrencies is also a source of exploitable confusion.  
I'm not saying its right to use the name 'bitcoin core' to refer to the currency coinbase calls BTC. But if you think about it, given neither 'bitcoin' or 'BTC' actually have 1 meaning, and 'bitcoin core' only operates on one currency - 'bitcoin core' is probably the least ambiguous way of referring to the currency coinbase calls 'BTC' - the currency calls bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:14
I think the idea is that with fork trying to take the name 'bitcoin', that word has become a bit ambiguous. Saying bitcoin core, although technically unnecessary, does attempt to avoid any confusion
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:02:45
Well that's because you've been buying bitcoin - not mining it.

So wallets will be lightning nodes in their own right? And will need to be always-on so that transactions can be made through it and also to poll the blockchain to give you a chance to retaliate against anyone that closes one of your channels in a state you don't want it to?   
I assume the idea is the wallets could be on your phone, so you can pay for things easily in the real world - but always-on isn't very mobile friendly. Ie, battery drain. The ideas of always on and convenient to use seem somewhat orthogonal for LN - unless the software running in your phone is just a thin client to your actual wallet that is on an always-on server somewhere... Which is then a threat to decentralisation?

I think this is the key issue here. It's all well and good saying that bitcoin is a store of value - just like gold, nobody buys things with gold, they just believe it has value etc - but people did buy things with gold in the past. People still buy gold jewellery. Gold has value to complete laymen who know nothing about economics or commodity markets. That is why it's such a good store of value today.  
  
If bitcoin alienates the masses by just being a store of value that doesn't have and never has had any practical purpose beyond storing value - then nobody's going to know about it and the value of bitcoin will, at best, be stunted. Retailers dropping support of it is the total opposite of what should be happening and will make other retailers think twice about adopting it.  
So while bitcoin's success isn't solely relying on Steam, in my view, it will owe a huge portion of it's success to widespread faith in it and that faith is going to be missing if nobody's heard of it or seen a practical use of it.  
My investment in bitcoin so far is a measurement of my current faith that it will be a success - not my desire for it to be a success. I really do want it to be hugely successful - but in its current state, I have concerns it'll fall short.

Transactions / channel would be an interesting stat. That'd be the number of transactions that no longer have to hit the blockchain 
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:43:36
That's all of them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:12:28
I know that's on my mind. BTC doesn't have a solid plan to address the scalability issue - which seems to be causing a lot of people to jump ship. I hope that the jumpers will cause BTC to dip pretty hard, then I buy more, then some good scale solutions are put forward and implemented so I can ride the price up high again.   
The risk with my plan is, if BTC doesn't get it's house in order, some other coin could dethrone it and I'll be left holding the bag.

I have physical cash on me now that literally has printed on it "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sub of five pounds" because (historically) you could take your £5 note to a bank and have it 'cashed-out' for the equivalent value in gold - because gold has actual value, paper notes are just IOUs.  
Lightning network is all about promising that at any point you can 'cash-out' the current state in your payment channels to the blockchain - ie, the equivalent balance in BTC. That promise is backed up by mathematics.  
BTC &amp; lightning network are trustless in that you don't need to trust an entity like a bank to keep your funds safe or fulfil their promise to provide you actual value. You do, however, need to trust the system, the mathematics, the cryptography etc. Which I and many other people on this sub think is fine. I'd rather do that than trust a bank.   
I have never reviewed bitcoin or lnd's code. Even if I did, I probably don't have the education or skill required to do a good job of that (crypto is *hard*). So although I don't have to trust a bank, I am placing my trust in a lot of other things and people.

Aren't keys generated by wallets just as susceptible to malware stealing them? I assume they must exist decrypted on your machine at some point during generation? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:46:04
Are hardware wallets pre-seeded or something? How can software wallets create private keys without the decrypted version being in ram for some time?

You can avoid fees sending in fiat and buying BTC, but I've yet to find a way to transfer BTC from gdax or coinbase without it being sent super-high-priority and getting hit with an unnecessarily large fee.
