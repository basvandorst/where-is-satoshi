In the mean time why not try the bitcoin love tester ;)
@_date: 2012-09-15 07:15:34
No this is not what you were just arguing.  
You were accusing us of lying about the house edge and donation amounts - you were incorrect, we have disproved  this completely.
Now you are simply **complaining for the sake of complaining**, if you do not like the concept of charity gambling, then it is not for you.


**THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE**
We have already disproved your flawed maths.  Stop spreading flawed FUD.

Im aiming to replicate the table I am familiar with. The 'standard' house edge also helps protect me the same as it does a casino. Satoshidice had a terrible run of luck at their start until they adjusted their house odds.
I will check the Wikipedia info on the alt table layouts and see if I cant accommodate your tastes :) 
Thank you for the feedback.
@_date: 2012-07-26 14:36:05
OK done, please be patient but I will setup a euro table after the public testing. The euro table will most likely have a smaller max bet to balance the draw to both.

You can easily verify this simply by looking at our logs.
The Jackpot update is shown first, including the txid that increased  the jackpot.
Take the 1st jackpot balance shown in my example: 1.3910889 BTC  
The next bet that increased the jackpot was:  
     1034c7bc4c3b54b5ca68b6b940d3eff46d7685ff8b171617d0f33a618d88a609
it increased the jackpot to: Jackpot 1.40108795 BTC.  
You can use blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com to verify the bet amount yourself, the bet size was 0.1 BTC.
       1.40108795 BTC
     - 1.3910889 BTC  
     ---------------------
     = 0.00999905 BTC Jackpot increase
The log shows us the player hit number  which returns 0.010% of your bet meaning the player losses 0.99%.
     0.1 BTC / 0.99 = 0.099 BTC loss
     0.099 * 0.1 = 0.0099 BTC donation.

Yes, it will be refunded today :)
@_date: 2012-07-26 15:22:11


Yes each player gets their own ball.


That would indeed suck, the likely hood of seeing 17 100 times in a row when the selection of numbers is 1-38 (37 and 38 are house numbers 0 and 00) is extremely low.
I have budgeted for 10, which if my maths are correct is a 1 in 6'278'211'847'988'224 chance of occurring.

edit, it took me several attempts but I have pin pointed your confusion.
**When a player wins, the casino loses on that bet (no house takings).  
The player has no losses on the bet as they just collected 300% of their original wager.  
So in this situation there is no "Player Losses" to donate".**

Hello Safwanish 
We operate a site similar to SD [satoshiroulette.com]( which generates verifiable results ala SD.  
Using a supported bitcoin client (we recommend bitcoin-qt or multibit for pc you send a bet to the address shown.
The game engine uses your TXID and a secret which is released the next day to generate your result, if you win (or lose) you automatically receive your payout back to the wallet.
@_date: 2012-08-18 11:35:18
Also, roulette is now out of beta testing and considered stable, thank you to all our players.  
@_date: 2012-10-29 05:33:24
Fantastic news :)
@_date: 2012-07-26 15:22:46
Each player has their own ball, the result is determined by your bets txid.
So think of it as your own private table :)
@_date: 2012-07-26 14:28:10
we use the txid for each transaction as and a secret key to generate the result.  
Each wallet "should" result in different txid's for each 0.2 bet (there may be the occasional collision).
The house has a reasonable bankroll behind it to handle paying out 10+ max bet wins on a single number in a row.
If you can generate the same txid again and again I would be very interested in how you achieve this (it would also mean Id need a new public secret).

you know I have been idly giving thought to a "one shot" blackjack bet system.  
one shot/one bet is my favorite style of game, quick and adrenaline inducing (the payout time of 15s-1min is the seems line 5min to me).  
The problem being is the player will not get to make additional bets....  
 has imho a great implementation, why not give my competition some of your hard earned btc ;)
@_date: 2012-07-26 14:43:08
That is a great idea, I shall work on a basic implementation soon and try to implement your complete suggestion after.
Satisfy my curiosity please, why would I want to gamble on my own table and win - it would reduce the houses pot.
I was planning monthly outages where the site would be down for maintenance and secret change, do you think this would be sufficient ?
Sorry if Im not making sense, its been a long day getting all this online (I have poured over the code using getrawtransaction 100 times without changing  anything just to ensure Im satisfied). I will be back online tomorrow to answer further questions.
If you want a tip for your helpful suggestion please reply with an address.
@_date: 2012-07-26 15:27:04
Ahh thanks for explaining that, atm the stakes are to low for me to honestly spend the time grinding the correct hash but I need to address that.  
By using the same secret, everyone can verify everyone else's bets and confirm when the secret change occurred.
I shall tip wikileaks 1 btc for you (I did not know they accepted).

As a [bitcoin casino]( operator it is true that you can have great success with a martingale strategy... but as this simulation shows it is all to easy to experience unexpected catastrophic losses using a martingale system.
The trick to gambling is two fold:  
1) do so only for entertainment value.  
2) Be able to: walk away with a profit and walk away with a loss (do not chase your losses).

To play our game/s you will need a compatible bitcoin wallet, I recommend using bitcoinqt or blockchain.info.
To bet, simply send your bet amount to the games address and a win or loss notification will be paid shortly.
You can click and drag the min and max bet buttons over bitcoinqt to have the bet address, name and amount filled in automatically for you.

**edit:** Should we reach 50 upvotes I will add another 1 BTC to the game jackpots.
@_date: 2013-03-09 16:49:13
All in good time sir.
Back when we started 1 bitcoin was only worth $5 and it seems like a good starting point, by the time we got around to looking at increasing the bet limits bitcoin had skyrocketed to nearly $50 in value.
Its actually quite staggering that our small operation can support bets of up to $50 on very high win multipliers.
Hopefully we can raise the bets in the future but for now they shall remain as is.
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:57:29
Further to our discussion Jackpot Dice (the opposite of Reverse Dice) has been updated to allow the lowest possible min bets on all games.
We are able to do this because Jackpot Dice does not payout losses, only wins. The advantage of this game is that its win multiplier is higher for the same reason.
@_date: 2013-03-09 16:52:00
TL;DR:  
Jackpot Dice now has even Higher payouts than reverse dice. Players have the choice of receiving losing payouts (reverse dice) or forgoing them with the reward of a higher win multiplier (jackpot dice).
We hope you like our latest update and thank you for the continued support with our little endeavor.

We need to ensure the house does not run at a steady loss on minimum bets. 
There are several variables that determine the minimum bet size we can offer.
* Loss Multiplier, the smaller the multiplier the bigger the min bet needs to be.   
* House Edge, we will try and absorb some of the txfee in the house takings. the lower our take is the less room we have to absorb the difference.  
* smallest bitcoin tx fee
For example, you make a bet of 0.05 agains rdice-128 which losses.  
0.05 btc x 0.006 loss multiplier = 0.0003 BTC minus tx fee of 0.0005 = -0.002 btc.
As you can see we make up the difference on the small bets by sending a satoshi as payment whenever the payout is below 0.00000001 btc.
So for us to offer bets any lower we would need to raise the loss multiplier which in turn reduces the win multiplier.  
Our game Jackpot Dice which does not payout losses has a much lower minimum bet:

Mainly its just the large amount of time required ;)
