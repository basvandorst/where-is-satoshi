[Bitcoins are completely traceable]( there is a record of every transaction in the block chain.
All someone you transfer money to has to do to find out exactly how much money you have and where it is is to look at where the money you give them came from and examine all transactions involving that address. Similarly, someone sending coins to one of your wallets just has to watch that address to find out where the money is ending up. All having multiple wallets (paper or not) accomplishes is adding a few more links in the chain, so it's still trivial to follow the money around.
Remaining pseudonymous is simple if your bitcoins are never connected to your real identity, but anonymity is impossible. The only advantage of having a paper wallet that I can see is that you don't lose all of your money in the event of a computer disaster, so having a physical copy of your keypair(s) make sense. The rest is totally unnecessary in my opinion, but I suppose you're entitled to do anything that makes you feel safer.
