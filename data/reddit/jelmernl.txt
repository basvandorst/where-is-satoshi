This hits close to home for me.
I have been travelling the world and living off of bug bounty programs/bitcoin revenue for almost 3 years now and always carried with me this little roll of paper which is burned like a pirate map at the sides. This little roll of paper contained a BIP38 password-encrypted paper wallet containing most of my bitcoins and I consider this wallet to be my retirement fund. This little roll was one day also nowhere to be found anymore.
Somewhere around March I noticed it's disappearance. I was pretty sure that during the creation of the wallet I gave 1 copy to my brother and 1 to my dad. My brother said he forgot about it and dad had some vague memories of me giving him a roll of paper mentioning to keep it and it was important to me but he couldn't find it as well. Some weeks later he suddenly found it in his administration.
I was very happy having the private key partially recovered and I remembered that I took the Ezekiel 25:17 as password for the wallet. So I loaded up youtube to watch the scene and write it down word for word expecting it to be an easy task. After many nights of frustration and much more wine to keep my anxiety together I figured I would take another approach and create permutations of the private key. Then just bruteforce it with those.
It was not until about 2 weeks ago I celebrated it's recovery. I now know that scene word for word and am happily using blockchain wallet with tripple factor authentication instead.
I have some additional coins stuck on a nexus 5 with broken screen I have had with me forever. The memory part is glued to the board. I was just waiting for the price of the screen to drop which it did by now. Still too lazy to get a new screen
