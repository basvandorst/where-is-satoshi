Seems like there are only two people in this entire thread with any actual sense. Maybe this thread has been botted?
Edit: Looks like a lot of the comments promoting the service has been removed and now only a few of the more honest responses remain. There were a lot more responses praising this service before, when I made this comment. If this company is willing to use bots to promote themselves then I doubt the morals of the team running the service.

It's good that you admit to that, as many aren't aware their service is doing this. If you want some brownie points among the privacy-centric people that use bitcoin, you should make it crystal clear that you collect this data on your website. 
At least more clear than having the privacy policy link tucked away at the bottom of the webpage.
