Yep, I agree that this needs to be improved, though that is there so that SAE can be easily accessible to users of NXT's awesome official client;  which provides only a secret phrase and allows them to easily input it there and access their NXT funds that way. I agree that this creates some confusion and we are thinking about how to improve the login screen interface.

Hi everyone, this is Sergey Nazarov. I am not BCnext and this is just a slight typo, I am the cofounder of  and  which proudly uses the Nxt blockchain's truly impressive capabilities for blockchain-based Secure Messaging, Decentralized Exchange and now Smart Contracts.
The credit for making Nxt goes to the truly world class Nxt Core Developers and the awesome Nxt community, which I encourage experienced coin developers to seriously consider joining based on Nxt's unmatched track record of releasing revolutionary working features, on schedule.

Yep,  is the easiest way to invest Bitcoin on the largest decentralized exchange out there by actual issuances made: 174 assets already issued and and an average of 3 new assets issued each day.
NXT's decentralized exchange is live, it executes quickly and it is growing rapidly, which is a large part of the reason NXT is now the third most valuable Cryptocurrency.

Hi, sorry for the confusion here, we plan to launch a conversion status window soon.
But our backend for SAE shows that your account received 1343.939346 NXT at 2014-07-11 13:41:15 UTC. Could you please check your account again since sometimes conversions with our exchange partners do take a few hours when the market is less active.
If you have more specific questions for us please feel free to email us at info

NXT has a fully functioning decentralized exchange that allows you to quickly invest in assets using Bitcoin and receive dividends from them just seconds after purchase, see for yourself;  
All the trading, ownership and even dividends payment data made by asset issuers is easily viewable in the NXT blockchain.

We completely agree and will work on improving the UI so that something like this doesn't happen again, if we have another case like this one we will make sure to move it to the top of our current sprint. Thanks for letting us know how this happened so clearly.

Where has it been announced that Overstock is going to use Counterparty and not a different platform like NXT? It seems like a few journalists jumped to a conclusion, or am I wrong...
