You're missing the bigger picture. It's the fact that the data is *immutable*. Generally search engines, content providers, etc have ways of removing the data. There is no way of removing it here.
This is just *one* example of the ways bad guys could use it. I think allowing storing arbitrary data is not a good idea and should be removed.

You're still missing the point.
The problem is the blockchain allowing for arbitrary *immutable* information that a bad actor could use to write the exact program you describe. It's *allowing* a bad actor to act in an *immutable* way. 
Hypothetical: Bad actor host a botnet c2 on tor. The server can be tracked down and removed from the internet without any repercussions or lasting damage and the signaling abilities are terminated. - If I find a way to start signaling botnets using the blockchain, you can't take my C2 down because the data in the blockchain is immutable. 
Edit: btw using a blockchain as c2 is already a thing -

Would be great if the laws actually applied like that for Child Pornography... but they don't. The bigger underlying issue is the fact that arbitrary data insertion into the blockchain can be abused in different ways. It's an immutable method of controlling a botnet. One of the ways botnets are toppled is to take down the command and control. Well here's a globally distributed and immutable structure for controlling a botnet. By the way botnet control via public blockchains.. already a thing. Google it.

The researchers found it. So obviously it's not a huge secret to finding it like you're claiming it is.

That's some material. Firstly, *I* never accused you of anything. You could be accused technically if you have a complete blockchain copy and you give the FBI a reason to visit you. They'll scour for anything they can use against you. 
I just see the larger picture of how a technology can be abused, and this is one of the ways. Add to that, child pornography laws are also rather fucked up in the US. They are extremely broad and make it insanely difficult to build a defense against. On top of that politicians use the 'think of the children' ploy all the time. Bitcoin is already under scrutiny by enough three letter agencies and governments due to the fact that it can, has been, and continues to be an unregulated financial utility. The bitcoin community shouldn't be dismissing malicious usage of the bitcoin blockchain network and instead should be trying to push for changes to secure it before gov't entities find enough excuses to finally get lawmakers to regulate bitcoin in the US. A quick way to let that happen is to allow a technology to be abused.

They are? Last I knew a bit was a 0 or 1. not 0-9 per place. Each byte can be a decimal value of 0-255. So not sure how you came to that conclusion.


Welp, obviously these researchers were able to find links that sent a browser to the image, which was the purpose of storing the data in the blockchain. It's immutable and mostly untraceable.

Sigh. Shortsightedness and you're missing the bigger topic. What's at the end of that link may mutable but the data stored in the blockchain *is* immutable. That's the part that's alarming. This is just one example of it being used in a bad way... Think about controlling a botnet via the blockchain. It would allow for the command and control server of a botnet to *never* be taken offline since the blockchain and all of the nodes that maintain it are *ALL*  redundant C2 servers.

I didn't change the subject. You just didn't understand what I said so you thought I was changing the subject. You didn't understand that the way the calculation you so skillfully copied and pasted was arrived at nor the low level computing behavior that allows for Pi to be calculated into the, by now, 10^15+ number of decimal places currently. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:27:29
You still mis-understand the larger issue and it completely evades you because you're so close minded you only see what's in front of you.
You see this issue as: okay some jerk stored some links to some child porn. BFD.
The real issue is: Data can be injected into the bitcoin blockchain that can be abused in significant ways: This is just *one* real world application in the wild. Here's the trouble. Sites storing child porn get shut down to remove the content from the internet... how can the content be removed from the block chain? It can't. It's immutable. The bitcoin block chain is being abused to also run botnets. Botnets typically are run from command and control servers. Those servers can be shut down. However there's now this globally distributed, immutable, always on infrastructure I can now control my botnet from ensuring it can *NEVER* be shut down. It's about the fact that the arbitrary data can be bad and can never be erased.

Taken out of context of your statement, that conversion works. The issue is that conversion has limited precision. If you want to go to the precision you're talking about of running pi into the near infinite number of decimal places needed to get the randomness you're seeking the calculations and storage of binary data to do the calculation are in a whole different format. In fact floating points aren't even used to do the division at those precisions because it's doing using integer based math which can handle infinite precision whereas any kind of floating point is severely limited in precision and is actually subject to floating point error. Google that term: floating point error.
Your lack of understanding of how decimal to binary conversion works in computing is clear.

Implying it's secret by saying it's non-trivial.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:15:42


Not as limited as you think. Entire images have been stored in a single transaction in the blockchain. That's a lot of space. What you think as a little bit of space, can be abused in huge ways.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:14:04
Can I point out you're missing a huge option? Fix the technology so arbitrary data can't be injected. Tadaa. Problem solved. Bitcoin keeps chugging, and no need for censorship.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:03:21


Correct, but calling it FUD and being dismissive is being ignorant of the bigger picture. Instead you should push for a change that would help make the blockchain not *able* to be used for this purpose. Then it would make it harder for lawmakers and skeptics of the technology to challenge it's legality and usefulness.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:56:21


Your analogy is similar to the understanding of a teenager who just got his A+ cert and works at Geek Squad. Do switches and routers store data? No more than necessary as a *temporary* buffer. Do wires? Wire's don't store *anything* they conduct electrons. The block chain stores arbitrary data immutably.


The botnet's infrastructure is eventually taken offline via erasure of the information, disconnection of the servers, etc. Can't do that if the place you store the information stores it an *immutable* structure (the blockchain) using always-online globally distributed network (the network of nodes).


The full node maintainer does. Does the data exist on the hard drive? Then yes he possesses it. Maybe unknown to him but people have been arrested and tried in court for piracy cases where open wifi allowed for neighbors to pirate material, download child pornography etc. There's been cases of people being arrested for possession of child pornography but their computer was hacked. 


Nope, the data is illegal. If it's being used in an illegal manner. It's illegal. 


Stop using the idiom 'in and of itself' it has no meaning and makes you look like an idiot when you're trying to outsmart someone. (similar to someone who uses irregardless).


Node operators store data. You don't understand how the internet works or any kind of low level computing (see: discussion about decimal to binary conversions). What the fuck is a subnet operator? and they're called TCP packets. 
TL;DR: Stop shooting your mouth off.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:34:06


As it should.


It may not be but linking to any illegal content or maintaining an index of it is still a crime (See: bittorrent indexing websites). That's why all the big search engines have mechanisms in place to remove links to illegal material. 
It raises the larger issue of the blockchain allowing arbitrary immutable information and all of the bad ways that can be used. Try to think of a little bit more than what's just in front of your face.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:06:14
Edit: to be more serious: This is a symptom of a larger problem. The allowing of immutable arbitrary data in a peer to peer distributed network. It can be abused and clearly is. The point people need to realize is that this ability needs to be removed. This is just one of many ways the legality and practicality of the bitcoin blockchain and other blockchains that allow this behavior are going to be challenged. It's being abused in other ways too:  - You should support the removing of the ability to store arbitrary data. This would help secure the blockchain, keep it from being abused, and keep lawmakers from having an excuse to make laws.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:07:58
That... that's not how binary to decimal works for a floating point. You actually just copied a series of numbers then turned that into binary.. and umm... hate to break it to you but binary doesn't work the way you think it does in numeric to binary conversion. 
You could have made your point by saying a random number of infinite size, that would make more sense but again, you wanna start talking random .... well with enough time and computing power i could randomly generate anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:32:07
Node operators wouldn't be running the botnet. Since *anyone* can inject arbitrary data into the blockchain *anyone* can run the botnet and use the bitcoin infrastructure as a command and control. All of these abuses of the technology are how it gets regulated. Stop giving lawmakers reasons to regulate it.
