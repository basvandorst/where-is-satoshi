"To the authors,
I am sending this to inform you that there is a serious falsehood on page 41 of the report under the Bitcoin Cash section. It states:
"In July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash." [emphasis mine]
The bolded section and the ensuing two sentences are blatantly factually incorrect. Segwit activation was a soft fork (backwards compatible as soft forks are, described correctly in your "Soft Forks" section on page 33).
Segwit activation itself did not cause a hard fork - the small group of users and miners who disagreed with Segwit activation hard forked to Bitcoin Cash as a response. Therefore, the Segwit Bitcoin chain is the original Bitcoin, while Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin. 
Please amend the report to correct this crucial mistake.
Thank you, 
Name"
