I’d be careful. The people spreading the FUD seem to be out in full force. It seems strange to me that just after the bear trend seems to have reversed (at least for now) all these people suddenly start to talk about the Tether conspiracy. 
I’m with you. I don’t think there is any conspiracy here. I think it’s just large players who want to enter the market without the regulatory risks/magnifying glass that comes from using huge amounts of USD. 
The irony is that with fiat currencies and banks no one even questions this at all. Do you believe that every bank holds a physical dollar in a vault somewhere for every dollar in your bank account with your name on it? I would be very surprised if they did, but no one questions them or demands an audit knowing that banks do much shadier things than Bitfinex/Tether such as launder money for terrorists. 
The only reason I can think of why people keep spreading this FUD is because they shorted or cashed out and their buy orders &lt; $9k did not fill so they need to try to scare people away. It reminds me of all the Bcash shills that woke up and started talking about how Bcash is the real Bitcoin right around the time Coinbase launched BCH trading.

It seems a lot like a coordinated attack to me. The last two days in particular the amount of FUD about Tether has increased dramatically. I think someone is trying to keep the price down and all the FUD about countries banning crypto has not been working so they are trying another angle.

Ask them how they feel a year or two from now when the price is back over $20k. This isn’t specific to your situation. All the “economists” from the mainstream media who have been saying this for a while are probably gloating now too. I’ve seen some crypto traders on twitter basically saying “I told you so” as well. Remember a broken clock is correct twice a day. 
The thing to remember is this has already happened to bitcoin multiple times in the past where it lost 70% to 90% of its value only to eventually push higher. Perhaps we will never see another all time high and this run is over for good, but I have my doubts about that. 
Imagine these people calling it a bubble in 2013 and gloating when the price fell from $1k to $100 only to watch it eventually rise up to $20k. If people don’t get it, it’s not worth your time to be annoyed about it. They are going to be the ones who panic buy at $100k or higher. 
Unless the price goes well below $1K I am not worried. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:12:04
In the past week Bitcoin has also been hitting its lowest prices in months which means a lot of people who have been on the sidelines are eager to buy in. If you are a big investor and missed out on Bitcoin when it was $5k last year then obviously you are going to look to buy when the price is moving down.

Depends on what they decide to do. If they add trading pairs for it then it could go up. If they just make it available to withdraw to a wallet or another exchange the price will likely drop.

No. People actually USING it is the reason it is slow and expensive. 
Take a look at the actual graph of transactions:
Anyway, BTC does need to fix the scaling, but BCH as of today would probably perform equally well with 1MB blocks because no one is actually using it.

Right now it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to spend it. Over time, chances are the price will stabilize as adoption increases, and at that point I think it will become more viable as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:55
Yeah I know. I have nothing against ETH. My main point was that BCH block size doesn't even matter because all transactions on the chain would fit into 1MB blocks now anyway. So it's kind of a funny argument cause if it did start being used by a lot more places it would still run into scaling issues as will ETH or LTC. It's the nature of the Blockchain

Have you ever in your life had an opinion about something and changed your mind days, weeks, months, or years later? If not then power to you. 
I will say as a software developer who has been in the tech industry for years, ideas evolve and change over time.  Sometimes things that looked like the right solution years ago may no longer make much sense today. 
Think about something like Flash on the Internet. That used to be the only way to make dynamic, animated content, but now it is dead in the water and no one uses it anymore. I believe it has been discontinued too. 
A technical white paper is not the same thing as a religious text or a country's constitution (Constitutions can even be amended hundreds of years after they were written). 
I've read the white paper and it is fantastic, but if Satoshi were around today do you think he would design everything the exact same way as described in the document? I strongly doubt it. People in technology are always looking for new and better solutions to problems.

I have something I have been wondering for a while. I am curious for anyone who is older than I am and was following the media coverage of the dot-com bubble in the late 90s, was everyone calling it a bubble at the time and telling people to stay away and predicting its collapse?
When reading about bubbles, a lot of things say that they are only obvious in retrospect and at the time no one realizes they are a bubble. That is what I find so interesting about Bitcoin and crypto currencies right now. Pretty much everyone is saying that it is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:34
I think you may be right, but one possibility to consider is that those buy orders way above market price came from Roger Ver or another BCH supporter with such deep pockets that the price doesn't matter. If they can convince the public that people are willing to pay a 100% premium on Bitcoin Cash then the public will buy it for that too. They may be shady characters, but they are not stupid. They are not going to watch on the sidelines while people dump their precious coin. 
That said this could still happen again when trading begins today.

They have had instant buys using a credit card for a while (with higher fees and lower limits). They are testing instant purchases from a bank account with some customers: 
The good (or bad) news is you get them at the price you paid when you bought. So if the price goes up between now and 10 days from now you don’t have to pay more money.

I think the secret will also be required cause that's how APIs usually work. You need the key and the secret to actually call the API from another app. As long as the permission is set to read only then you can give out both keys. It's not the same as giving out a private key to a wallet

It is crazy. The only thing I can think of is lots of new people are signing up for Coinbase and they look at the price of Bitcoin and see it is over $17,000 per coin and Litecoin at $300 looks quite appealing. It's psychological. 
Litecoin is more or less a Bitcoin clone but has a 2.5 minute block time instead of 10 mins which means it can process more transactions but also has a higher overall supply.

Don't you think it would be nice to just fall asleep for a year and wake up to see Bitcoin at $50k. I'm starting to get so tired of seeing and hearing all the FUD and bearishness on social media and in the mainstream media. 
What has happened in the last couple weeks? 
* BTC crashed due to an attack from BCH and Coinbase where large market sells from whales drove the price lower and triggered more and more stop losses and panic selling 
* FUD coming out of South Korea crashed the price 10% in less than an hour despite the fact that the regulations were reported weeks ago
Perhaps I am the only one who sees these as huge positives for Bitcoin. For one, despite the high fees and clogged up network, Bitcoin survived round three of Roger Ver's hostile takeover attempt with Bcash. 
The South Korea news seems to just be stating that you will have to use an identity in order to trade on an exchange, you have to be over the age of 19, and regular people cannot invest in ICOs. I don't see how that can possibly justify such a big sell off. Why does everyone panic at the smallest mention of regulations? This means anonymous whales can no longer manipulate the markets as easily. That is a huge positive. 
None of the fundamentals have changed. None of the tech has changed. If anything, we are in a better place now than we were a few weeks ago since Segwit awareness/adoption is slowly increasing, and there is a Lightning Network release candidate that is currently being tested on mainnet and hopefully will be released in 2018. 
Despite all this, all I hear is about how the price will drop to $8k or lower. I think it's a bunch of traders who have exited their positions and are shorting Bitcoin and are creating an echo chamber. 
I've seen Bitcoin bounce back from worse, and I see no reason it won't be able to do it again. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:29:43
So you are making the assumption that the price will go up as a result of the futures. I think it could very well have the opposite effect. Big investors want to profit off of bitcoin but big financial institutions and governments also want to see it die. 
I know it is cynical, but I can’t help but wonder if people will short bitcoin on the futures markets will also stirring up a ton of FUD in the mainstream media in order to create panic in the market and profit while also driving the price down.
All it would take is people going short on the futures market and a few articles saying the US government is planning on banning bitcoin. I hope Bitcoin will prove resilient to that type of attack, but I, for one, am feeling worried about it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:50:39
I have a question. Since opening the payment channel requires an on chain transaction does that incur its own set of fees? If I walk into a coffee shop and want to buy a coffee but don't have a payment channel open yet doesn't that mean I could have to wait minutes/hours before the payment channel is ready?
It sounds like the only way to get your Bitcoin back from a channel is to close the channel? The more people who close channels the worse this system is going to scale and then it goes back to my first question. 
I think this sounds a bit better than the bcash approach of bigger blocks just cause it should be able to scale better longterm, but it also sounds many times more complicated (especially being able to route payments through other user's payment channels - that sounds like a huge problem waiting to happen)

That’s a really good question. I think a bunch of things may happen before then. First of all, Bitcoin transactions right now are a kind of secondary use case to buying and holding in a wallet. The last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140. 
Assuming Bitcoin makes it that long (and civilization does too) then it is very likely that a couple things will happen:
1. Bitcoin will be used for transactions much much much more than it is today
2. It will be possible for anyone to mine without requiring special, expensive hardware, and without requiring a huge drain on energy. It is hard to imagine that computer power and hard drive space in the future will not be orders of magnitude better than it is now.
It is pretty difficult to imagine what things will look like over 100 years from now, but if Bitcoin is able to scale to handle many many more transactions than it does now, and more people are able to get in on the action without enduring huge electricity costs, then there will still be incentives for people to mine and secure the network.
It is also extremely likely the proof of work algorithm will have to change much sooner than that due to quantum computers which will render pretty much all crypto currencies today obsolete if they are not updated.
I also am not certain that Bitcoin will even exist 123 years from now. It is possible that we will have something completely different by then.

I agree. The guy is simply toxic. It doesn't matter if you support lightning network or bigger blocks. His attitude is disgusting. He can't have a civil conversation with anyone. All he does is bash "Bitcoin Core" and refuse to even acknowledge it as its real name, Bitcoin. 
Someone asked him on CNBC what was Bitcoin cash's plan to scale once the bigger blocks are not large enough. Do you increase the block sizes forever? And rather than answer the question he just want on an attack of "Bitcoin Core" for a couple minutes. 
He is so narcissistic that he fails to even comprehend how his actions can have a negative effect for everyone in crypto. People who are Ethereum or Litecoin supporters may disagree with some decisions made by Bitcoin people, but they don't go on tv and trash them. They recognize that their projects wouldn't even exist without Bitcoin. Roger acts like people on the core development team murdered his family. Not only that but the spam attacks on the Bitcoin network and intentional large market sells and market manipulation do not help anyone. He even said  that insider trading should not be illegal and should happen more often.  
The fact of the matter is as of today the reason Bitcoin cash transactions are cheaper and faster is because nobody is using it. They could change the block size to 1MB tomorrow and none of the Bitcoin cash supporters would even know the difference. 
I can only imagine how confused I would be if I signed up on Coinbase for the first time and had to choose between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. There is a good possibility I wouldn't buy either one.

Big banks have access to every newspaper and government official they want. They could easily pay some politician to draft a bill that makes Bitcoin illegal to drive the price down, accumulate, and then a couple weeks later announce that the bill has been killed.

Can you explain how volatility will decrease as a result? From what I understand buying futures does not require buying or selling Bitcoin itself. 
The only way I imagine volatility going down is if Bitcoin price continues to go up which will make it harder to cause huge fluctuations in the market cause it will require more money to. 
I understand the points about legitimizing Bitcoin and reducing uncertainty, but I don't understand how the futures will change the actual Bitcoin markets if they are not actually changing the supply of bitcoins.

A little background:
I wrote this article because I have been getting tired of hearing the same criticisms over and over again about Bitcoin. I have seen a ton of articles published lately which have been spreading misleading information.
The main goal of the article is to educate new investors and get them to at least have an open mind and question what they hear people saying in the news about Bitcoin. I think it is healthy to hear arguments from both sides, and I do not think my arguments are definitive.
I also made an effort to not speculate on the price of Bitcoin or whether what we are seeing is a bubble or not.
Nothing I mention should be considered investment advice.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:49
You are wrong again. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. The smallest amount of bitcoin is called 1 Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). This means there are 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis that will be in circulation which is greater than the number of US pennies in circulation today.

This argument has always bothered me. You could say the same thing about any technology. Uber shouldn’t have any value because there are tons of other ride sharing companies. Facebook shouldn’t have any value because any developer can launch another social network. 
I understand what you are saying about the scarcity. Technically you could fork bitcoin and have another coin that also allows 21 million (like Bcash), but that does not mean it is going to have the same brand recognition, network effect, number of users, number of miners, etc.
There are already thousands of crypto currencies, and none of them are even close to Bitcoin’s market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:03:56
Can you explain how gun, vaults, and manpower use more energy than Bitcoin mining? Do you have a source for the fact that the current banking system used MUCH more energy than Bitcoin? Bitcoin is using more energy than 159 different countries. 
You may be correct that the current number of miners can continue to secure the network, but you are then not taking into account that if Bitcoin continues to grow in value, more people will begin mining in order to get in on the action.

Without owning any it will be difficult to drop the price since they don’t have any to dump on the market. The best they can do is a massive FUD attack using mainstream media and to shake public optimism/confidence in Bitcoin.

It looks like a lot of things happened behind the scenes, but it is hard to have definitive proof. 
There were lots of articles published like this one:
There were tons of Bcash shills out in full force on Twitter and Reddit to downvote any criticisms.
The Bitcoin mempool was flooded with small transactions paying huge fees to try to make the network unusable. 
There was insider trading leading up to the Coinbase BCH release. They pegged the BCH price on GDAX to $8,500 and later 0.280 on the ratio before trading began. They didn't allow the public to buy or sell on Coinbase until after Roger Ver went on CNBC to trash "Bitcoin Core". 
There were bots running on exchanges to market sell huge amounts of Bitcoin and market buy huge amounts of Bcash. These bots continued to run up until recently. 
I am sure I'm missing some other things here. 
You can think that this sounds like some crazy conspiracy, but considering it was the 3rd time something like this has happened, I think it's very likely that it was a deliberate and coordinated attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:34:48

I still don't understand this argument. Yes, if Tether is not fully backed by USD then it could lead to problems if a lot of investors all want to cash out at once. This will shake investor confidence in Tether and Bitfinex, but it doesn't say anything bad about Bitcoin itself. The flood of new attention and buyers to the space aren't going to care about Tether. They probably don't even know what it is. 
On top of that, I believe the price of Bitcoin during this run up has been led by Asian markets which do not trade using Tether as far as I know. 
I just have a hard time envisioning a single exchange crashing Bitcoin right now.

If you are referring to a wallet never give out your private key. If you are referring to a trading API you should also never give out your keys unless you know what they can/will be used for. 
For example, the GDAX API lets you trade your currencies on GDAX using the API key and secret. They have permissions for each key where you can set them to view only (to see past orders/trades) and also you can give permission to allow withdrawals. 
You should never give your API keys away to an untrusted person or company. Also you should make sure to disable withdrawals so they can't steal your coins. 
That said, providing your API keys from Coinbase to something like Mint should be safe, but make sure to read their FAQs

I don't think this sounds very different from the Internet itself. When you explain the Internet to someone they don't usually have to know about DNS and HTTP and TLS and packets and the underlying protocols. In a way that is what makes a web browser so powerful. Anyone can use it without having to know all of the nitty gritty details about how it works behind the scenes.
I think most people are totally fine letting more technical people handle creating the tools for them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:26
Hmm so this article doesn’t really make a very convincing argument for me. It basically mentioned one guy’s opinion that the collapse of Tether and/or Bitfinex will bring down the entire crypto market without giving any justification for why they believe that. I don’t think that is true at all. There are so many other exchanges, and I think more people trade directly with their currencies than using USDT.
If it is true that tether doesn’t have actual backing then certainly some people may lose trust with exchanges, but a few bad actors with one exchange doesn’t say anything bad about Bitcoin or other crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:50:03
I think you are onto something. Bcash has been holding its value relative to Bitcoin extraordinarily well. So well that I am almost certain there are other forces at play here. In the past when BCH had a big pump it dumped immediately after, but this time it has held its value pretty well. 
I have been noticing bots on multiple exchanges that constantly place market orders to buy BCH. Every few seconds a new market buy is placed. I'm not certain but I think the reverse is also happening where every few seconds there are bots placing market sells on Bitcoin. 
In the past they tried using buy walls to pump up the price of BCash and sell walls to hold down the price of Bitcoin, but I think they realized that market buys and sells would be more effective since people were eating through the walls. 
Anyway I don't like it one bit and I think everyone should be worried that BCH has been hovering around 0.2 BTC for days now. I have no doubts that Roger Vermin and his army will launch another attack on BTC in the coming weeks/months and each time they may get a little closer to the flippening. 
I think the extra volume you are seeing is due to these bots. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:10:38
I agree with you in theory, but from what I have read that is not how it has worked with gold and silver and other futures markets. People tend to believe "If Wall Street is shorting Bitcoin then they must know something that I don't". This mentality is probably incorrect, but psychologically it makes sense. 
That being said they can't short unless someone else takes a corresponding long position. So it's possible that the price is not impacted. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:26
A correction just means the market is overbought and there aren't enough people buying to keep the price from falling so there will be a wave of sell pressure that will knock down the price. It is not uncommon for it to retrace down 61.8% from the length of the runup

I agree that he is a scammer and is trying to promote an alt coin and pass it off as if it is the real Bitcoin in order to trick people into buying it. I also believe he has engaged in market manipulation and attacked the Bitcoin network and driven down the price of Bitcoin while pumping up the price of Bitcoin cash. 
I think he is very likely a sociopath and truly believes Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin.
It is important that the public is informed about this, but someone should document the reasons Bitcoin Cash is a scam. 
To be honest, the best way to put an end to Bitcoin Cash is to get the Lightning Network launched because then transactions will be instant and cheap for BTC, and there will be no need for Bitcoin Cash anymore.

Ha I was going to ask the same thing. I tried many millions of combinations too, and no dice.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:15:53
I have been wondering why the Bcash ratio has been staying so strong around 0.18 to 0.2, and after observing the traffic on Bittrex for a little while I am almost certain it is due to bots. 
If you look at the order history you will see that every few seconds new market buys are issued. Here is a screenshot of some recent order activity:
The Bcash supporters will probably come on and say this is natural market activity, and everyone just wants to buy, but if someone really was looking to accumulate a lot of BCH, they would be smarter and use limit buys rather than market buys that keep driving up the price. 
This looks to me like someone with deep pockets is trying to keep the ratio from falling. 
Sadly, the only way to prove this theory would be to try to make the bid/ask spread really far apart. Like if someone were to place a huge market sell and bring the highest bid down to 0.170 but keep the ask at 0.190 and see if the coins at 0.190 still get bought up (despite the fact that people are willing to sell for much cheaper). I am almost certain that they would be.
If I had to guess I would say that the same thing is happening on GDAX too. This is the best explanation I can come up with as to why the BCH price is staying so strong.
I guess we will have to hope that eventually whoever is doing this will run out of money so the market can speak for itself.

@_date: 2017-12-06 13:58:44
I think this is somewhat missing the point. What I think we may be seeing now is mass adoption of a new technology. 
At the moment it is true that using Bitcoin as an actual currency to transact with does not make any sense. This is not just because of the increasing price, but also because the fees are too high. You also would have to pay capital gains taxes on every purchase. 
I think all these issues will be resolved eventually. Once adoption reaches more of the population, the price should stabilize, and the volatility should decrease (I hope). By the time that happens there should also be a better scaling solution such as the lightning network or something new entirely to handle a higher volume of transactions with lower fees. The tax issues will only be problems for people who bought in early, but there was already a bill proposed in Congress to make purchases &lt; $500 exempt from capital gains taxes. Not sure what the status of that is now. 
Bitcoin cash (Bcash) is approaching the problem from the other direction and attempting to make a currency that you can transact with today. I don't think that is the right way to go about it because it too will suffer the same problems if adoption increases. It still has a limited supply so the value would increase as more people use it which makes it less viable as a currency.

I had been thinking ever since the futures were announced that they would be bad for Bitcoin and allow people with deep pockets to short and drive down the price, but as soon as I read that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Citigroup were lobbying to try to get the futures trading suspended, I started to rethink my stance a little bit. 
It is certainly possible they are bluffing, but I have to believe that anything the big banks don't want to happen is probably a good thing for Bitcoin. There has also been a **LOT** of FUD in the mainstream media over the last few days like  and also people spreading lies or outright false information like Jim Cramer:  
I know it's impossible to know what is going to happen in the future when the futures market opens, but I am starting to think it may end up being a big non-event. The fact that everyone now is uncertain and thinks the price will crash makes me wonder if the market will do the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:37
I would normally post this in BitcoinMarkets, but the Bcash shills have been in full force there for days. 
I wrote up a theory before the futures markets opened that many of the institutional investors would buy up a lot of Bitcoin and pump the price up leading to the futures launch and then short and sell to drive the price down. There is no way to prove that that happened directly, but I do think it's interesting that every day since the futures launch has been in the red.  I'm well aware of "buy the rumor, sell the news", but the pump leading up to it was crazy. 
Anyway what I am wondering is if people think this drop is 
1. A normal, healthy correction 
2. The "bubble" bursting and we are not going to stop falling
3. Futures markets manipulating the price for their own benefit
4. Market worry due to Coinbase insider trading speculation 
5. Roger Ver and Bcash attacks creating FUD and also attacking the network and issuing large market sells to try to crash Bitcoin
Or perhaps it is a combination of all five

So I just sent some BTC to GDAX and it was an address starting with a 3 (segwit), but when I try to send it to a segwit wallet (bech32 - bc1 address) it says “Not a valid address”, and from Coinbase it says “Please enter a valid BTC address”. 
I can open a support ticket with them, but I am just curious if anyone knows if/when they plan on supporting withdrawals to segwit bech32 addresses. Thanks

I think you have it backwards. The futures market allows you to short and is cash settled which means you are not required to own the underlying asset.
ETFs require ownership of the underlying asset and are designed to take long positions which will increase demand and decrease supply. 
This is why futures markets were approved so quickly. They allow easy price manipulation. 
You can short with an ETF, but most investors go long as he points out.

Something I’ve been wondering a lot lately is if the price follows the news or the news follows the price. I think honestly it is a bit of both. The media desperately needs a way to explain when markets rally or sell off so they try to tie it to news events, but in reality it is a lot more complex than that. 
There wasn’t a single event that caused the end of the rally to $20k. More likely the market was way overbought and needed to take a breather. 
Same thing at the bottom at $6k (if it is in fact the bottom). It wasn’t the US senate hearing about crypto that caused the dip to stop. It was that sellers were exhausted.

Not sure if anyone caught this at the meeting, but the SEC chairman basically admitted that they don’t want to allow an ETF because it encourages long positions and they want to “protect investors”.
I edited out the clip of the video and posted it here for anyone interested:

Not demand by futures traders. If a bitcoin ETF is offered to institutional investors then it offers them an opportunity to easily invest long term in Bitcoin and the provider of the ETF would buy up and hold the underlying Bitcoins on their behalf. 
That is not true with futures markets where you can take either side of a trade without ever touching the underlying asset. 
What I suspect is going to happen is they are going to continue to drag their feet on an ETF until the futures volume is so high that the banks are able to manipulate the price of bitcoin to their liking and only then will an ETF be approved

I believe strongly that they will. I also believe they are going to talk about it tomorrow at the hearing. When it comes down to it they do not like currencies that allow you to transact anonymously.  It’s hypocritical of course cause *they* want them for themselves and their black ops, but not for the public. 
I don’t think it’s going to happen tomorrow or even in the next few years, but I do think it will happen and it worries me. They want to be able to track every dollar that every person spends in real time. 
And I’m worried they could criminalize Bitcoin for “national security” reasons. The indictments from Friday only referenced a single Bitcoin transaction in February 2016 for 0.026043 BTC or approximately $9 at the time. But they still pushed their agenda in the media with articles like
I do not believe that is an accident. This may give them the ammunition they need to justify cracking down on Bitcoin due to issues of “national security”. Of course they will overlook the fact that using Bitcoin actually *helped* them track down the hackers.
Let’s not forget the information in the indictment is also just allegations. There is no evidence or proof that this happened. That makes it even easier for them to manipulate the public sentiment to achieve their agenda. 
I really really really hope I am wrong.

Ya I did check them, but there is not a lot of information about them available online. One of them wrote this article:
[Governments could take bitcoin out of circulation]( 
From Alex J Pollock, Washington, DC, US
And it is fairly recent too.

I just posted some thoughts on Twitter about the upcoming [House Hearing about Cryptocurrencies]( For some reason I have a _very_ bad feeling about it. I am curious what people here think, and if you are worried or if you think it will be positive for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Twitter thread is [here](
