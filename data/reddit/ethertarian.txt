No. You're just 100% wrong.  Nobody with a home connection would ever be able to download the full block chain, they wouldn't ever be able to catch up with blocks that big.
1GB/min = 1,440 GB/day = 43.2 TB/month.
This type of bandwidth is affordable available virtually nowhere.  Most ISP's have data caps around 300GB, and even those cost $80+ a month.
Try doing market research before you make silly comments.
Block sizes over 10MB will make running a full node at home virtually unaffordable.  10GB is a joke, it would mean Bitcoin is no longer decentralized.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:01:52
It's going to miners, but the value of Bitcoin will drop because of the attack, making it cheaper for the attacker to buy more bitcoins to spam the network with.  The positive feedback loop means eventually the network crashes and bitcoin is valueless
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:38:05
20MB * 144 * 365 =  1.2 TB /yr in block chain growth.   That makes it expensive to run a full node.   That means number of nodes drops from 6000 now to about 100 nodes.  No longer centralized.  Bitcoin dies.   Bigger blocks == less nodes.
@_date: 2015-05-22 06:19:11
I don't think you understand.  The point is to use the blockchain as a transparent, non-reputable, tamper-proof settlement ledger.

That's simply false.  If you need any further evidence of you being wrong, look to NASDAQ's pilot program listing assets on the block chain.  
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:26:30
But it would mean 20*144 = 3GB / day = 1.2TB / yr if blocks are full.  Not good for decentralization.

No, they don't have most of the functions that the ethereum network has for scaling -- uncle blocks, swarm for storage, whisper for messaging, etc
@_date: 2015-05-10 00:55:30


and not positive enough to offset the attack.


no, because the price of bitcoin crashes due to the attack, so buying new coins to continue to attack it is cheaper. also, you only need a fixed about of BTC to do the spam, so during the crash, the attacker can buy enough BTC to continue to spam as long as it has a budget to do so
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:57:21

Simple logic dictates it would be an enormous negative, not a plus.  
Anyone with a brain can look at market liquidity and see $4M/yr is nothing and would not cause any noticeable increase in price.


This attack does not add value to bitcoin, it reduces its utility which causes the value to bitcoin to crash.

If you can't read, you can't read.  It's just a statement of fact.
You said "you're moving the goalposts anyway, going from claiming that affordable broadband that handle those transfer is not available, to claiming its availability is limited."
I never said it wasn't available.  I stated clearly that that type of bandwidth is available virtually nowhere, and that statement is 100% correct.
In every case, it would result in less nodes and a less decentralized network. 
And aside from the bandwidth, How much does 43TB/yr of storage cost?  About $1,500.
Sorry but you simply can't have a healthy decentralized network with blocks that large and full node cost so high.  Just facts...

Don't worry , When Kirk Sorensen reads Vitalik's paper and condenses it into a 5 minute video, you'll be able to understand it too.


Ah, nothing like hypocrisy. Take you own advice...
- "I'd say it was a piece of shit"
- "The reference list is about as selfserving/sparse as it gets, about as diverse as sterilised water"
- "If you or others want to defend Vitalik or make excuses for him then you are dishonest and simply being fanboys."
- " he can't lower his ego and talk simply like the rest of us,"


Maybe that has something to do with it being version 0.0.2?! No, probably not... Let's just call the early draft shit because it's too long and has too much math instead of talking about some actual substance in the paper!!

Do people buy art to look at it, or to sell it later at a higher price?  
Some do, some don't.
Is art a security?  No. 
This is true for any product in the world.  That fact that a product might increase in value over time does not mean it is a security. 
If a bird is blue, it doesn't mean all birds are blue.
People bought Ethers so that they could access the Ethereum network when it launches, and build applications on top of it.    Whether or not they think they can sell that 'access' at a higher price in the future is irrelevant to whether or not it's a security.
And according to a major law firm who wrote a hundreds-of-thousands of dollars legal opinion, it is not a security.

So, your hash assessment is my fault?  You didn't jump the gun at all?   I suppose some people always need someone else to blame.

I believe Vitalik made this draft available particularly so people could comment on it.  You were highly critical of the formatting, which is fine, but I found it to be in a rude and condescending tone.  Maybe I was wrong, maybe I wasn't.  Either way, I responded with my opinion.

Actually, Ethers are trading at 3x on secondary markets that have default risk.  Remove that default risk and the real price is likely $1.50-$2 per ether.  A good return from $0.33

Those few words matter.  They are the difference between and appcoin, and not an appcoin.
You don't have to hold ether over money or productive assets, but you have to buy ether if you want to use ethereum.  It will have a price depending on how much demand there is for access to the system is.  Sort of like baseball or concert tickets.

Good points on Engineers vs politicians.  Unfortunately his conclusions are absurd.
Mining cartels arise from the fact that Satoshi didn't design a more granular reward for miners. 
It has nothing to do with libertarian vs anarchy.  It's called game theory. 
The Bitcoin foundation is a group of individuals who came together to form a voluntary organization to promote Bitcoin. It is voluntary.  It forces noone to join it, and it forces nobody to do anything.   Calling it Bitcoins 'state' is nonsense.
When people really want to 'prove' their political theories to be correct, they really do tend draw conclusions in all the wrong places.

It's more likely that that the 100 million is for most of the equity, not 10% of it.  i.e. the people putting in the money are the ones running the company.   And they have a long-term bullish view on bitcoin and the price, so yes, mining makes lots of sense at $1000+ bitcoin.

In the absence of the **Bitcoin** standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves. […] This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists’ tirades against **Bitcoin**. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. **Bitcoin** stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists’ antagonism toward the **Bitcoin** standard.

If there is a concern with voter intimidation/fraud, then governments can use multi-sig or another mechanism and only sign tx's when people are physically in voting booths. This won't allow voting from home, but will at least allow for elections results that can't be changed after the fact.   Still can be done on the blockchain, and would be better then current system.  So OP saying 'stop talking about voting on blockchain' is nonsense.    He should have written 'stop talking about *insecure* voting on blockchain'

Sorry, your inference is not correct.  I've exited two companies in the past 7 years and am currently working on my 3rd which will be built on the Ethereum platform.
Further, pointing to thoughts and discussions of other users is still a deflection.  You've provided no original thoughts to elaborate on your insinuation that Vitalik's views are flawed, yet you'll waste your time instead talking about how much you make on an hourly basis.  
According to my math you've already wasted 3 hours, which is around $750 worth of wasted time.

The diference is that the USA can print more money to pay off its debts... you can't.  So, in technical terms, it is sustainable indefinitely.   
What **isn't** sustainable is the purchasing power of the dollar if it prints too many of them.   So far that hasn't been the case.  In fact USD is the strongest currency worldwide this year and has the most demand.   
Ultimately resources aren't sustainable, the earth isn't sustainable, nothing is "sustainable" in the long run... But I think the US will sustain 'reserve status' for much longer then anyone suspects

'appcoin' has no definition, it's not in any dictionary, and people have differing opinions of what an appcoin is.
Ethereum can be forked, but the fork will not have as much value as Ethereum, unless it's Bitcoin that's doing the forking (which won't happen).  The notion that just because something can be forked makes it worthless is silly. That is only true if the platform has no network-effect.

Agreed. Theymos is a theif, who stole 8000 BTC in donations by lying about where they would be used.  After not using them he didn't return them to donators after the value rose so high.  Totally unscrupulous.

"I never said the theories, or the math is shit, I said the paper is shit/shambles."
Considering the paper contains theories and math, when you make a blanket statement "that the paper is shit", readers (I know this will come as a shock to you) will assume that you're talking about its contents (yes. shocking). 
If you wanted to be honest, you could have said "I glanced over this quickly, and it looks like the structure could use some work.  I can't comment on any substance however, because I haven't read it all, or don't understand the subject matter"
You claim you're trying to tell other people how to be a better writer, but can't even review a paper without being condescending or using flippant language.  Do you see the problem here?    By the way, you've claimed to have written whitepapers and 'read hundreds' of them. Why not share some examples of your work and provide a comparison and constructive criticism?

This is absurd.  Any product in the world has a possibility of being resold at a different price the the purchase price.  People don't buy them with the expectation of a capital gain unless the manufacturer is marketing it as such.
Are prints of photographs a security?  Maybe the artist becomes popular one day and they're worth something?
Ethereum made it clear there is no expectation of a capital gain, and that they were selling a product, not an investment.    According to your logic, every product in the world is potential a security.

First, as a thought experiment, lets assume that all the volume in the world is from Bob and Alice who trade $1 billion back and forth between eachother in a narrow price band near $250 on Huobi with 0% fees, trying to pick up pennies from eachother.  Here comes along Frank with his mining profits.  Unfortunately, neither Bob nor Alice are willing to purchase the $450,000 that Frank puts on the ask say, at $240 (i.e., they don't want to accumulate).  So, Bob and Alice just continue trading at $239.99 and ignore Frank's liquidity as a maker on the book.  The price has just dropped $10 because of newly mined coins, even though there's $1billion in volume.  Now expand the number of participants from Bob and Alice to what we have in the actual market, but the logic is still the same. 
And that, folks, is how mining liquidity pushes the prices down.  Just because we see volume, it does not follow that mining profits can be absorbed.
*What matters most is the willingness of market participants to accumulate new liquidity at current market prices.*   Volume is certainly one part of the puzzle, but to say "dont worry because trading volume is 35 times that" is an incomplete analysis and naive assumption.

You're wrong.  20 million 14nm chips mining at 10W each would be 40% of the entire bitcoin network.  The chips don't cost much, and the consumer pays for electricity.
Anyway rumors have already confirmed this.... Apparently their investor deck has been circulated around... they're putting mining chips into consumer electronics.
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:32:53
full reward goes to 21inc.  They share revenue with the consumer, or the manufacturer of the goods.  i.e. a router that also mines will be x% cheaper for the consumer to purchase.
You dont have to configure anything.  As long as its an IoT device, its plug and play.

How you do know Mycelium is not honeypotting or backdooring info given that their CTO is doing the analysis?  You're trusting the wallet from the people doing the analysis.  Have you deterministically built from source and compared the digest to the binaries in the app store?  Has anyone?  Didn't think so.

Must be real vaporware that IBM is running ADEPT and IoT devices on?
Go ahead and download PoC9 or look at their github.  You people are simply idiots or just trolls.

I agree. Relying on a 3rd party server is a bad model.  SPV is the only way to go.

This debate can be summed up like this:
**"We know Bitcoin is broken, and RBF would make this obvious to everyone.  Lets not implement this and keep it a secret at long as possible; then we don't have to fix it and can keep our heads in the sand.  The bad guys can keep stealing in the meantime, but there aren't many of them so don't worry. I'll hide the truth you don't want to hear to make you feel better."
**"We know Bitcoin is broken, and RBF would make this obvious to everyone. Let's implement it, so this issue can have the attention it needs to be fixed.  This is a political move to force fixing now what's in Bitcoin's best long-term interests later. I'll tell you the truth you don't like, and I don't care how you feel about it."

It doesn't expend significantly more electricity.  Maybe 5 or 10 Watts.  The device is subsidized because of the revenue it generates for the manufacturer, so the consumer pays less upfront and buys the hardware.
Anyway, that's what the company is doing, and $120million says you're wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:34:49
You would be breaking multi-national state laws by running this centrally.  And you can't run it without being a central trusted 3rd party.
Bitcoin's scripting language isn't instrospective so you can't use a block hash as a drawing number programmed into a contract.
With Ethereum, this is a 30 minute programming job.  (Feel free to implement it as a sidechain for all of your bitcoin maximalists)
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:19:09


Maybe not zero, but the PoW would need to be changed.  This is exactly what people were complaining about in the other thread. Go read it.


False. They are building 14nm chips, which would be the most efficient chips physically possible.  It can run 10Watts and plug into any Router or IoT device.


False.  The theoretical maximum is unlimited as the price of bitcoin rises.


Every mining company has to pay to build the mining chips. There's lots of room left for subsidy when your operational cost is $0.


You don't have to wait... talk to people in the VC space and they'll confirm.  Also read the other thread.

Wrong.  Consumers routinely buy subsidized hardware even though it costs them more in the long run.  Cell phones are a good example.  Billions of people do this.
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:30:10
I'll be downvoted for saying this even though its true... Counterparty on Mobile devices must rely on trusted 3rd party server to relaying transactions to it.  Ethereum on the other hand was specifically designed for thin clients (mobile) to work without any 3rd party trust.
A smart contract platform that doesn't work in a trustless manner on smartphones and thin clients is a non-starter.
This 'we put Ethereum on top of Counterpary on top of Bitcoin' just seems like Counterparty grasping at straws as the Overstock deal dies and its market cap and price crash.
Lots of pumpers in here pushing this article.  Counterparty is going to the same place Mastercoin went.  Sorry investors.

And how do you know the binary in the store is doing what the code says? Did you deterministically compile it yourself and check the digests?   Wouldn't be surprised if these guys have a backdoor in mycelium to track transactions considering this nonsense.

I disagree, it's not in his best interest to break the law.


No, he's not.


No, he's not.  Nobody places blame on the victim of a robbery.


You're right. Your analogy is warped, idiotic, and retarded reasoning, which is why it's not valid.  


No, they're not.  The terms of sale clearly defined how they would operate, and they have not violated any of the terms of sale.  Even by your analysis "Close, but not criminal."  Well you yourself have just admitted they're not doing anything criminal.   You might not like them because you're butthurt, but don't try to libelously suggest they've broken any laws.


It certainly would.  Fully in compliance with Swiss laws, and over $250,000 spent on legal work surrounding the sale.


What token? Your idiotic and non-valid analogy?  


Sorry, I don't condone violence.


50,000 lines of code on github, 40 employees, 1000's in the reddit community, and IBM using their code in ADEPT is vaporware?

Actually, you're wrong there again.  Because of economies of scale,  The only company that will be able to mine profitably in the world will be 21Inc.  All other farms and solo-miners at home will have to turn off.


That's $14.6 a year.  That's enough to take 50% off the cost of a router.
When Bitcoin goes back to $1,000, that will be 16 cents a day or $58.4 a year.  Thats enough for a free router.  
I'll take the free router and plug it in, I don't care about the 10W it's costing my because electricity is included for free in my rent, just like millions of people around the world.  Ultimately, landlords renting houses/apts end up losing because of 21inc.
So, now you understand the business model. Free routers and IoT hardware because they have bitcoin mining chips in them.

Seems like Mike Hearn has demonstrated time and time again that he is not interested in privacy when it comes to Bitcoin transactions.

Because they might not want to accumulate all that liquidity at $239.99, but they were willing to accumulate and distribute small amounts from each other, over and over again at a lower price (either as a HFT algorithim, or even just to fake volume for manipulation purposes). As Frank introduces more liquidity, they may not want to accumulate it for whatever reason. 


That logic is correct.  How much it goes up is a function of the supply and demand ;)
