Piles of *bit*coins?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:26:22
Yeah in like 20 years

Bitcoin is a way to bypass government money and that leaves the government not in control. They want to control as much as they can so they are making Butcoin out to be an illegal currency when it is used in both positive and negative trabsactions. Just like any other currency out there? How about we attack the USD because every day illegal transactions happen using cash? This is ridiculous and government corruption and tyranny at its finest.

Unless you have a credit card on the account then it's a 5 day wait for long time buyers as well I believe.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:35:43
I bought from Coinbase. Seems to be the easiest for beginners.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:33:21
You are literally asking for Bitcoins. Be them for you or your cousin or whatever, there is no doubt that YOU ARE asking for Bitcoins... Don't argue otherwise or you'll look like an imbecile. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:29:31
But if everyone starts buying then it will go up again?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:46:57
We should start calling mBTC credits. Holy shit I'm in Star Wars.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:48:50
Which wallet? One similar to Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:47:34
No I have a debit card. Damn, I really do hate credit cards. Why would using credit cards give me the instant benefit?
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:46:31

                        so complain

Well I hooked up my checking account that has a visa debit on it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:13:02
What aboot the caribou eh?
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:16:42
Yeah haha good for you!
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:58:07
Hmm, would it be wise to create an online account with my real name or no?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:24:56
Holding them. Buy cheap, sell high. That's pretty much all I do personally with Bitcoin, but of course you could purchase things with them, it's also a good way to transfer funds internationally with ease.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:57:00
I've even heard of the double verification being compromised. Regardless I always take my BTC out of any exchange as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:49:52
I'm not asking what's going to happen, I'm asking everyone's "opinions".

Definitely this. Get the majority of your BitCoin news from where people actually understand how Bitcoin works and what it is.

Ah I see! I've been checking throughout the day and even 10 minutes ago it would not go through! Thank you! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:42:27
I don't understand?
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:49:21
.... WAT
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:25:38
Wow thanks for the long reply! ;)
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:13:52
I think he meant like an actual, physical coin with a BTC on it.... :/
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:54:22
I made a support ticket via the application on their website. They got back to me in around 3 days and the support was SUPERB. May not be the most efficient, but damn do they have great support when they get to your email.

This is amazing such hilarious
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:53:55
Not exactly. 0.333333333333... and continue as much as the exchange will let you. Pretty damn close at least. Or you could just stay with 0.33 or 0.333 and be fine with it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:35:49
Wallets for sure. Exchange accounts can be compromised.
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:16:31
Aha! Thanks mate! Appreciate it! ;D

I bought 0.10 BTC nearly 28 hours ago now through Coinbase to test it out. When you are buying on Coinbase it is not instantaneous like a wallet-to-wallet transaction would be because Coinbase needs to find/buy BTC that they have to sell to you. the purchase hasn't even registered in my bank account yet. I believe I also read somewhere on the Coinbase website that it takes 3-4 days on average for a purchase to go through. Someone please correct me if I'm misinformed about any of this as I am new to Bitcoins. :D
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:47:36
I lol'd
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:36:18
So how did it work? Did you pay with cash and did you provide your wallet address? Or did they print out a paper wallet for you? What was the QR code for, your wallet? I'm still trying to understand how the BTC ATM actually works. :D
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:46:19
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:16:40
They are probably receiving a lot of emails so it may take longer, also many of the support guys, and even the founders of Coinbase browse this subreddit often. More than once have I seen them help a omeone through reddit and got everything taken care of in a jiffy!id give in two more days though because of all the traffic they are receiving. :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:28:17

@_date: 2013-11-05 14:24:50
Could I potentially lose Bitcoins I send to it?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:12:06
Lol never noticed that 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:56:17
If you want out I'll take some
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:53:31

I don't understand paper or brainwallets. Can someone explain please? :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:30:18
How does one type the Bitcoin "B" without the use of copy and paste?
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:22:02
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:43:48
Yes it is spelled correctly. I clicked the link and logged in. It said that "The token has been redeemed". But I still have 0 BTC. I'm just curious what happened haha
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:41:30
Yeah that would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:43:12
Considering this GIF, it would suit OP nicely 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:47:53
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?!
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:50:09
So I read up a bit about bit coins via your link given. What would be the best way to obtain a wallet, download one onto my computer, Coinbase, or MyWallet? Coinbase looks like the best, but which one would be safest, easiest, benefits/disadvantages of each? Also could I make an offline wallet for safe storage, then transfer them to an online wallet like Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:37:59
By the way do you know if the price is expected to go up or down in light of today's senate meeting?
