You'd pay an initial fee for the account setup.
You're funding the account and have those funds ready to be used on the lightning network. You can freely spend them with whatever is connected to the node you are connecting to. Be it a coffee shop, an exchange, your local weed seller, Aunt Karen, etc. Your funds would be "locked in" in the sense that - ideally - you'd be able to use your funds to pay for a lot more than just your weed, similar to how your funds on your bank account are "locked in".
I do think the actual workings of LN will be much clearer once we actually have a user-friendly setup and UI for it, because there is a lot of misconception going on about it.

Coolski. I've been a trader for the larger part of my life, too, and short squeezes weren't defined by whales doing it in neither firms I've worked at.  
Not sure why you're so hungup on some authorative body.  
The point was that your first comment said that other people are misusing the term and then stated what the true definition is, which you're now clarifying on (it's just what jargon you're used to) and - as it turns out - you agree there isn't a true definition and that using the term for what people are commonly using it for isn't really all that wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-15 08:40:46
Err, no. A short squeeze isn't necessarily created by whales.  
It can theoretically be caused by one or more but the term doesn't exclusively mean what you're saying, nor was it the true definition. 
The trap scenarios play into those cases but it's not like the definition of a short squeeze has to involve whales. 
They're identified by the general interest ratio in shorts which more often does *not* involve whale A trying to squeeze out whale B than it does.

The TA you've seen on here is mislabled bullshit. People trying to use it to predict what happens, that's bullshit and not the goal of TA.
For any serious trader, it's an important tool to have in your belt. It's been tainted for some of you because of the kids that try to use it as a forecast instead of something to build a trading strategy on. It should have never caught on here, because for 99% of the people here, trading crypto is just a bad idea.  
If you think TA is generally bullshit, you're out of it and don't know what you're talking about. Because TA is not a weather forecast, which is what so many of the posts during the bull runs wanted you to believe.  
Instead it is a stategy building tool that can easily skew the odds in your favour. Instead of a 50/50 you can make smarter decisions and let the results trend into a 55:/45 or better. What serious trader wouldn't take the chance to do so?

I'd say at a basic level, it helps to find general trends and trade around them. Visualizing support and resistance levels is also a major part of TA.
There's always a possibility that something unforeseen happens, though, and while TA doesn't take that away, it can still be a good tool to have in your belt in order to visualize and develop trading strategies or models.  
For example, there are certain patterns with moving averages that have a clear tendency to line up often.  
But as previously stated, the point isn't to be 100% accurate.  
TA basically helps you to build a model to trade after. Coupling TA with proper risk management can be incredibly useful, but I wouldn't recommend swing trading (let alone day trading) for anyone who's simply going off some TA patterns that he's read about on Investopedia.
Fundamental analysis isn't failproof either. But it's useful to see merit in a project/company for buy &amp; hold strategies.  
If normal trading would have a 50% chance of failure/success I'd take any tool I can get to help me shift that ratio to 60% success any day.

The thing is that during the bullruns people kept posting their TA charts and acted like they could predict the market movement.  
This seriously soured peoples taste whenever TA comes up, now. It can be a serious tool to build trading- and risk-management-strategies when used properly in all market directions instead of shilling your paid group because you came off like Nostradamus with your upwards pointing diagonal lines in a bull market.  (The collective "you", mind). 
It doesn't predict markets with absolute certainty, and it is not supposed to. It's just a tool on a belt for traders. In some areas it can just be a self-fullfilling prophecy, but the edge it can give you is an edge I'd personally - under consideration of my personal circumstances - take over the "hodl" meme or plain old DCA any day.

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:47:46
No, you have to realize that SegWit was already designed for block sizes around 2MB. Legacy nodes will still receive blocks under 1MB because those will contain no witness data. Once fully rolled out, the average SegWit block size would already be around 2MB.  
Overall, you should be way less worried about scalability right now (because we already have SegWit for now) but more about mining centralization.
What 2X does is increasing the maximum block *weight* to around 8MB, while the older blocks will have a size of 2MB.  
Miner profit doesn't increase with block size but instead with block weight. Miners have no reason to make a block the maximum block size as after a certain point  (4MB 2X; 2MB Core) they'd have to remove transactions to make the block size go up that would already be around the block weight limit, which would in turn add cost (due to larger blocks) and reduce fees. So they will mine 2MB blocks with SegWit and around 4MB with 2X. They will make sure to maximize block weight since that's where their profit is at, bringing the SegWit block weight to 4MB and 2X block weight to 8MB.  
Why is SegWit2X needed when SegWit alone isn't even running on full potential?  
Why not rename the coin and instead, try to change the perception of the hardforked currency by announcing it will be listed as "Bitcoin" on Coinbase?  
Why launch without replay and vehemently try to make it happen sooner rather than later?
There would be enough time to implement replay protection to 2X. But that's not what 2X is all about, is it?  
It's not about the block size or weight. It's about influence, control, and disruption.  
Note the 
NYA is somehow an agreement instead of a proposal, much to the same degree as XT not too long ago ("We're doing it. We have the majority behind us" etc). An agreement between big companies trying to increase their already big influence on the ecosystem.

Taking care of your crypto, storing it safely, is neither easy nor intuitive. I had a hard time explaining how a tablet works to my grandma. Can't even begin to imagine explaining how to backup her wallet.  
Keeping money with a bank is about as safe as it can get for Normy McNormalface.   
You won't have to worry about your funds being lost because your harddrive died on you, or your computer was stolen, or maybe your phone, or that Trezor or Ledger stops working, or your house burned down, etc.  
People would have to take good care of their money themselves.
With a credit or debit card, it is easy to just have it canceled in case of loss or theft. A new one is issued and you're good to go.
You even have options since you can still pay via Paypal, Amazon Pay, and whatnot, because those can be linked to your CC and/or bank account.

Bitfinex is trading futures on it and people are already selling them as they realize that.

So, your advice of mining is only good if someone doesn't have to pay for electricity. How often is that the case?  
If it's the landlord paying for it, he will increase the rent or respective portion of your installments.

While comical from this one frame, the short video isn't really wrong.  
It's just a 2 minute segment that can be summed up as follows:
&amp;nbsp; 
"Look at this sexy chart, That's Bitcoin. This last bump (to around 4200 USD as it is from around September) could have something to do with Un and Trump, but to understand why, you have to understand what it is".
Then follows up with a basic explanation, mentioning the fear of people in a crisis to not be able to access their bank accounts, thus, seeking safety in Bitcoin, also mentioning the Venezuela situation.  
"Nobody can say for sure if BTC is going to follow this extreme upwards trend, but it probably won't tank for quite a while considering the crises in different parts of the world".  
&amp;nbsp; 
It's overall just a short informal clip for the uninformed, not really anything wrong. The clip itself is from a private TV channel RTL.  
The blog "Der Wächter" simply used the clip to go along with its article, that I'm not really interested in reading since Der Wächter is quite the tinfoil-blog.

The real gem here are the comments of the post in the screenshot.

This. I am still by no means rich but I was able to jumpstart my little company, that I already had before I got into Bitcoin, by selling the majority of what I was holding, allowing us to grow exactly when we needed to.  
If it wasn't for Bitcoin I'd still have a dayjob on the side, with less time for my wife and kids, compared to now. I was just really lucky. I'll at least never look back and think "ooh I wish I hadn't sold back then".

I have no illusions about the risk I am taking. I don't blame you if you're not willing to take that risk, as that's sensible. There are safer assets to invest in.  
Doesn't mean it's as bleak now as you make it out to be.  
Even if it isn't Bitcoin itself profiting off of it, I'm convinced Blockchain technology will have a huge impact on many aspects of our lives in years to come. It won't necessarily be with any of the cryptocurrencies today. Maybe not even with any cryptocurrency at all. And you are probably right that there is some bubble that's going to pop, but that's most likely some years off, and won't change the fact that there is a technology that changed the lives of billions.  
In the end, it will be Bitcoin that pretty much caused the boom on this technology.  
If there is a chance I can profit from that boom with small investments, I'll take it.  
If the whole market collapses tomorrow and never recovers I'm fine. My livelihood doesn't depend on it. If it blows up to a multi-trillion dollar market, I won't have any interest in rubbing it in people's faces who weren't willing to gamble in the early stages, either. I hate "I told you so"-attitudes as everyone can look smart with hindsight.   
I consider myself lucky to be in a position where I can afford to invest small amounts in something that might be worth a multitude of what I've invested without being too sad if it doesn't happen.  
Maybe it's something that my daughters can inherit. If not, I took care there's something left for them when I'm gone. No delusion here, but I appreciate your advice, as it is something that people have to be aware of.

The electricity bill that comes with it means you would have been better off buying coins for it.

A Bitcoin client, allowing you to run a wallet, full nodes, etc.

In for a rude awakening, too. That's not how any of this works.

Likely a short squeeze. BTC was heavily shorted in the region between 6-7k.  
It's what a sharp increase in price is called because it forces those who had short positions to close those positions, most of the time at a loss.
