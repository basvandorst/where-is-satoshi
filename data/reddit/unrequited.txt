WTF? I [post this 7 hours ago]( and get voted to 0, you post it 4 hours later and get it to 8? I'm confused hah. I guess image posts &gt; text posts. \^_^

I'm travelling outside the country, and it will help me use my bitcoin wherever VISA is accepted. Thanks!

What bug did you think you found?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:30:48
Thanks in advance:

Come on... I scoffed when people were throwing around conspiracy theories previously, but this is past coincidence...

Well... if the industry can't find payment processors or banks to serve them, maybe bitcoin wins in the end! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:58:47
i hodl because of people like you making this community tighter. i also ordered one, but if i win, i'd like another heh.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:40:59
Where are you getting that not all crypto taxes are taxable from? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:24:21
Like-kind exchanges still aren't "okay" just because they're blocked out from 2018 onwards, you still have a bunch of paperwork on these specific transactions, here's a good interview with a couple CPA firms:
@_date: 2015-09-05 19:21:13
Well your transaction WAS quick, right? Put down the bud and confirm your transactions three times before signing them. User error is not error when you're using power- or dev-level operations (e.g. not a simple transaction). If it makes you feel better, at least you [didn't screw up to the tune of $617BB with your mistake]( 
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:04:37
BCH analysis please too and maybe a cross comparison analysis please? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:03:30

...and yet you only have 1TX on this address.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:44:25
WTF, I only took four days to get verified! I didn't do anything special.
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:54:15
Give [this]( a read, might be up your alley, and a glimpse of the future...
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:58:26
What's your address so I can watch it for when somebody hacks it eventually because of your reuse.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:50:10
Works for me, just tried it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:25:05
It's an infrastructure right now. There are apps being made, and helper websites being created which will increase the ease of use to make bitcoin more accessible to the general public. It's coming.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:23:37
Get the transaction id and then search [here]( (putting the transaction id in the URL). Here's an [example]( and you can see the # of confirmations at the bottom. Could it be that you didn't add a transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:17:20
If you don't have much money, I wouldn't gamble the BTC that you have...
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:29:37
Hidden fees? No. They have pretty up front fees though, and they're not insignificant. If you're in a place where you can find a local seller, localbitcoins would get you BTC immediately, and face-to-face.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:44:50
Then log onto your account there and look at your history. /facepalm
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:17:45
Spend some BTC on a [gyft]( Amazon.com card and order yourself some sleepytime tea. ^_^
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:03:00
A full bitcoin was never intended to be the denomination of transactions... which is why they can be split into satoshis. USD isn't hurt by $10,000 bills (as rare as they are), we have $50, $1, and even coins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:05:04
Well when you get hooked up again, add google authenticator, that way you're not waiting for a text, you have a synched code generator on your phone all the time.

[This guy is]( but I just tested it (again) and still have no problems.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:57:45
Yeah, it's called arbitrage, but the reason why mtgox's price is so hard is because it's hard to get your cash back out if you're in the States.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:39:49
If an exploit either in the protoco or implementation of bitcoin is released, there might be a move to LTC or another currency. If bitcoin takes off as in Visa/Mastercard takes off, then 10-minute confirmation times might push the market to use another coin which has a faster response rate. BTC was the first, but it won't be the last.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:23:49
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:24:40
The value isn't in the coins generated, it's in the adoption and volume of transactions that BTC is being used for in substitution for Paypal, wiretransfers, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:34:54
[gyft]( has a bunch of gift cards that you can buy with BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:13:54
Nerves. If nobody panic buy'ed when the price was going up it wouldn't go up as quickly either.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:32:13
You can build omnibox searches from almost ANY webpage:
Also, Chrome builds in a right-click "add as search engine" for almost any search box (try it on the subreddit search on the top right). If you wanted to omnibox bitcoin you could just make the keyword "br" and just br[tab] and then type in what you wanted to search for.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:30:55
Counterfeiter could just use those same addresses though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:28:35
Ask them to send it back nicely. If they're your friends or co-workers it's a good learning lesson for the both of you.

@_date: 2013-11-19 15:49:32
Yes. If people use BTC it will have more value. That's why the USD has such value in the world because you can use USD in a lot of countries which aren't the United States.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:53:17
Says "Estimated Confirmation Time 5 minutes (queue position 311)"
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:54:58
You could use a [BTC Merchant Service](
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:33:23
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:05:18
They had all the details when you clicked submit, I don't know why this is a surprise to you now. Just hold it for when it (hopefully) goes back up. For the future, check out localbitcoins and find somebody you can make a face-to-face buy from instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:12:27
It's somewhat self-correcting as coinbase users have to rely on localbitcoins or other more expensive markets which will drive up the price accordingly.

Not to take the windout of your sails, but what does this plugin offer me that creating a search engine for Chrome omnibox (the tab-complete in the location bar) doesn't offer?
I just have this set as a search engine:
and then I type bl[tab] and paste whatever I'm searching.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:23:13
*shrug* Those people who sold at $900 made a **crapton** of money. Good for them. Those of us who hold will (hopefully) make an even larger crapton in a couple months/years/whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:25:39
If you've giving 'em away, thank you in advance:
You could always just transfer it to your [bitcointip wallet]( and use it on reddit to tip comments you think are worthy over the next couple days/months a little at a time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:36:44
Mainstream adoption is months away, I feel. Already mom &amp; pops are taking advantage of [BTC Merchant Services]( and anybody with a paper wallet can use BTC like they would any ATM card.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:32:19
This [portfolio website]( (my-btc.info) has stats on its users, and if you're looking to do any sort of analysis on your holdings, it's a great tool as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:24
Call your insurance company, and declare them. I doubt it though, insurance usually covers tangibles (like your $500 PC).
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:28:39
Contact the FBI and or Secret Service (or the analog in your country). It's what they're specialized in handling unlike your local police department. As for actually getting your $ back? Unlikely, unless they build a case, get more people who have been scammed, catch the guy, seize his funds, and then possibly you'll get some if not all of your cash back. Take it as a learning lesson in eBay and online purchasing, sorry.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:41:26
Verifiable transactions are not the same thing as trackable transactions. If I wanted to waste the transaction fees, I could send my BTC to myself over and over to newly generated addresses over and over, and it'd look like a lot of movement with no real economic impact (besides donating transaction fees). 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:59:22
Well people who paid a higher fee will jump the queue in front of you so...
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:37:34
What did you use to transfer it? Look in the history of that online wallet, or program, or phone app and you should be able to see your transaction id.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:16:42
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:07:34
$1MM USD. I don't have a degree in economics though so that's a number pulled out of my ass, pretty much like anybody else who gives you an answer who isn't an econ professor at Northwestern. It has [surpassed Western Union in volume already though]( so it's on its way.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:18:21
Yay, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:30:50
Hold it, if the next 6 months are anything like the previous 6 ("past performance is not indicative of future growth" and all that) it's VERY doubtful you'd make the same gains betting it, and very likely you'll lose some if not all of your stash by then.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:06:24
Doesn't work in Opera. Also, you should have a conversion between popular formats like mBTC or uBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:05:54
Hah, true. Good luck convincing your insurance company of that though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:01:22
Cashing out or Rupee currency speculation/trading?

You'll never make money with any non-ASIC rig because of the difficulty, but if your computer is on all the time anyways (media server, file server, etc.) and you don't mind (or actually want) the wasted power and extra heat output then go right ahead. My two fileservers are also my spaceheaters so I don't have to turn on central heating in my apartment. Winter is coming.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:13:19
Adoption and volume will stabilize the currency. What bitcoin doesn't need is an external force pushing the price in one direction or another.
