you mean they should copy uber/lyft and raised crazy amounts of money to subsidize consumer pricing ? i'd be down for that lol.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:54:11
yes, they really missed an opportunity there.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:04:34
sounds like a nightmare
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:10:55
That price surcharge looks ridiculous
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:36:47
sounds like they are having fraud issues. i heard they had a lot of thefts with people crowbaring the machines fairly easily.

Yea, customize the BTM screens with whatever the current scam of the month is. Or are there too many to list?

go to a libertyx cashier or atm (libertyx.com). not anonymous but is quick. guessing if you use coinbase you don't care about anonymity anyways.

Sweeeet. Do they also allow selling bitcoin back to debit card?
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:15:01
what about libertyx? they have cashiers &amp; ATMs
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:26:46
What’s cold hard cash? Is that a new token?
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:43:21
What btm company? Out them! They should prevent this. Isn’t that what all those regulations and KYC and compliance are for!

it seems like the days of just having a few machines are over. if you want to do this, you need to have a plan to scale to dozens of locations so you can spread out all the fixed expenses across machines (e.g. legal, cash collection, banking, support, etc).

4% fee but another 5-7% in the FX rate compared vs. coinbase
@_date: 2019-09-11 00:31:09
OC libertyx atms &amp; cashiers: [

Check out a LibertyX bitcoin-enabled ATM. They are regular ATMs as well and take debit cards.
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:22:33
Yeah travelex does this the worst with their no fee
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:01:39
Could be the miner / transaction fee not being transparent and the BTM just paying it out of your purchase. Also could be price gouging by the BTM operator.
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:21:40
What is inside? Bitcoin atm? Bitcoin cashier? Or is it for selling merch for bitcoin? These questions need answers!
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:38:09
Coinbase spread? There were multiple reports of people saying it was 4%+ in spread alone
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:11:47
I also would recommend libertyx for first time users. You can use whatever bitcoin wallet you want as well.

Someone needs to build a new locator. Coinatmradar has too many locations listed. Very cluttered search.
