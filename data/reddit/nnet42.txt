yeah, most of the exchanges are custodial and centralized so they should never be trusted 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:13:36
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. BCH is a centralized shitcoin. Glad we cleared that up.

The block chain with the most computing power is the authority. That ledger would need to be manually corrected, which would result in a fork, and everyone would need to be in agreement that this forked ledger is the new, correct one.
The system itself was never meant to be able to backtrack on transactions.

There is still a lot of speculation as to where the "missing" mt gox coins are, and people are still working hard to figure it out.
If it was in fact a transaction malleability bug, it was essentially receipt fraud. 
Someone transferred coins out of mt gox while claiming the transaction didn't go through, so mt gox continued to send coins until either their wallet was empty, or it was finally stopped by mt gox, but only after it got really bad.
This was a bug in the mt gox side of things and not a fault in the bitcoin protocol.
For the laundering stolen coins part: 
Edit: The records could theoretically be fixed if they were able to tell exactly what happened, but that would require a hard fork in the block chain, something that would never be agreed upon/ever happen.

yeah too bad it isn't something watchable instead.

IMO I don't think the fork has anything to do with the price increase and I doubt we'll see much of a dip.

Solid market advice for bitcoin is never short, only buy the dips.

I'm sure they have more than plenty on hand. They probably run their own mining operation. I doubt they ever buy from anyone other than the site users.

I haven't figured that out either. I don't think we'll see below 7k again and think we are going to hit 8k by monday. It'll recover real fast if there is any drop. There are an insane number of new users everyday now and that alone adds value. Potentially getting new coins on the failed network is not enough to push the price like this. I think more and more people are realizing there are only &lt; 21 million whole coins and the price attracting new users feeds into itself exponentially. I think the bubbles are over for the foreseeable future. The growth may be unnatural but so is bitcoin.

It is really silly to think any corporation would think highly enough of you to offer good sense common courtesies out of the kindness of their hearts. They will use you to any extent they can; they only exist for money and they are not your friend. Take your money elsewhere if you disagree with their tactics, maybe write them a stern letter if you feel so inclined.
On a side note, I have used cex for many years. Their platform sucks. Pick something else like bittrex or gemini.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:32:15
If anything they will be buying up as much as possible, not selling. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:38:45
Nope, they have no obligation to do that.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:24:12
You voluntarily gave them the info. There may be tons of reasons why they decide not to verify you based on all sorts of info in your application and they can't verify whether or not they can verify you without first having your application.
I too would be light on the details of what rules are in place for verification processes. Otherwise you are giving the bad actors instructions to get around the roadblocks.

There isn't really much volume in btc trading yet, compared to other currencies. Groups with decent amounts of btc can flood the market with buy and sell orders and manipulate the market price fairly easily. Bitcoin is a gamble just because it is so young, so that and low volume magnifies the FUD.
In reality there is a very limited supply of bitcoin. It is extremely undervalued which is starting to change as the recent price increases are catching the attention of big financial systems who have not yet realized bitcoin's utility. The price will continue to rise as coins become more scarce.

Not missing anything. The blockchain is the future of large scale financial systems, making many of the current institutions obsolete. It is going to be like going from dial-up to fiber.
I see the scenario of it being a global payment currency as completely valid, along with the alts.
There are only less than 21M whole coins. It doesn't matter that current buyers are seeking speculative gain, 15-20 years from now the average user won't ever see a whole coin. Bitcoin's limited supply, divisibility, and the ever increasing resources needed to mine it make for a better store of value than gold.

They also tend to unfairly affect the less well off by not taxing the rich proportionately. Should have pre-mined for a new global government.

From what I gather, those who are leaving have already left. With HK, I meant there is an easy avenue for withdrawing funds after the exchanges are shut down. I don't think Chinese traders will have much of a problem getting around regulations.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:31:57
This may be their last chance to buy for a while. I'd buy up as much as I can before the next halving. The china stuff also doesn't affect hong kong apparently.

Yeah, I already work remotely 98% of the time. I'd never need to go to work if everyone else worked remotely too. That is always the goal of business, to become more efficient. Part of my day job is PCI compliance for systems that process credit card transactions.   My personal view is that the blockchain provides an entire tool set of incredible functionality for large scale financial systems. Even if it is never adopted by retail consumers, big money will use it heavily. The current systems that process fiat transactions have major problems and everyone knows it.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:08:46
Are there already more people holding some btc than total available whole coins?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:18:57
Just like China, the Russian government is investing heavily in crypto.
First a ban, then gov issued licenses and regulation.
And just like China, the traders find their way around restrictions with ease.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:48:59
Yep, that is pretty much it. Same rules that any other currency exchange would have. It is all good.

Coins are not being created, only found. There will only ever be 21M coins in existence, with a good chunk of them lost forever. Price will only go up.
