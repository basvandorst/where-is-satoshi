Boeing at $120 would have been awesome advice.  Boeing at $300 is chasing gains that ain't gonna happen.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:41:17
Wait.  So you've actually convinced yourself that you've bought bitcoin "for the good of mankind"?  Bwahahahahahaha!
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:54:11
Not to mention the inherently unprofitable nature built into the Tesla 3.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:35:21
Classic stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:39:46
Tesla will be going out of business in the not-so-distant future, so I wouldn't bank on them.

I have my sources that I check out and my own filters I apply, just like you.  This guy isn't going to be a source of any opinion or information for me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:23:49
Yes, it's all about dollars.

I came here to comment after watching this guy for 15 seconds.  He's clearly pretty unstable.

I thought one of the selling points of Bitcoin was that it existed outside of the control of government..?  Isn't that part of its appeal?
I understand where you're coming from on the free market front; I watched in disbelief as the Fed stepped in and propped up the real estate market in 2009-2010 and didn't let it find a "true" bottom.  But as much as it probably would've served **my** interests to see prices plummet - since I did not get sucked into the California real estate mania - it was probably for the common good that they didn't.  People will always find a way to allocate assets in a lumpy fashion; as long as humans are the way they are, it doesn't matter what instrument(s) are used to facilitate the trading of goods/services there will always be some bumps along the way.
Getting back to this Chamath fellow, I see three things of note:  he made a bunch of money for being involved with Facebook, he's a fan of Tesla and he's got a venture capital fund.  Sounds like he's participating quite well in the current environment.  By the way, Mr. Musk's money-losing venture would never be allowed to exist in the absence of ridiculous amounts of money sloshing around in the system.  I'm going to assume that since you seem to be a psuedo-idealist, you're also a fan of Mr. Musk.  If not, I apologize for assuming as much.

Is Bitcoin still gonna be used as a currency, or are we going with strictly a store of value now?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:10:18
So you don't believe in the need for an elastic money supply?  I would argue that the Fed's "untold trillions of dollars" is actually also blowing up the Bitcoin bubble.  Do you see Bitcoin as a solution to bubbles?
Would you say that something like the Panic of 1907 - before the current Federal Reserve system - was the result of too much money in circulation?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:49
Lots of suckers left out there!
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:17:28
It's gonna be something to behold, all right.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:52:27
You gotta be shitting me.  eBay's future is all about Bitcoin?  
Reign in the enthusiasm, bro.  I mean, I know you're "making" more money than you ever imagined you'd make on a "investment", but take it easy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:07:00
Lolz.  Love it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:54:48
Mine or his?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:48:30
"You cannot have central banks printing infinite money" - people take this guy seriously on these issues?  Lolz.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:06:27
Seriously, what does this guy know or think he knows about the US banking system?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:50:11
Ah, I see.  He has Russian ties.  That's all I need to know.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:09
Lol.  Impeccable logic.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:24:19
You guys need to step away from whatever tool you are using to see bitcoin prices (in terms of dollars) and get yourselves a little education.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:46:30


Sorry to be ignorant, but who's doing the insuring?
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:43:00


You almost have me convinced!
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:26:10
You're missing the point.  I don't care how you "value" bitcoin, I'm saying folks need to get a little education about how the U.S. banking system works before they go posting this nonsense about how "fiat currency is worthless".
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:43:32
With that kind of attitude, you're almost all set to invest in real assets.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:26:41
Doubtful it will ever reach the level of FDIC insurance.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:20:41
Is any one of those guys going to end up like Jamie Dimon suggested..?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:55:44
Indeed.  Good call.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:18:46
No, you're missing the point.  Crypto "fans" are pretty sure nobody else "gets" crypto but them.  The sooner you learn this, the better.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:28:47
Oh, for sure idiots are going to stop doing things.  Especially since you're adamant about it.  Good work.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:11:13
Folks have never needed to know what goes into producing gold.  Or much about gold at all.  Or how gold is traded.  Why does anyone need to "know" that much about crypto?  If it's a store of value, how much should I need to know about it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:26:37
After the NASDAQ hit 5,000 in 1999, it was an awesome buying opportunity when it hit 4,000.  Or was it?  Quick!  This is a test!
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:23:13
But..but... BITCOIN!!
