looking at other comments..
I bought them from cavirtex, my bank was one of the few they didnt accept so i had to add a payee like i was paying a bill and send it into an account on cavirtex. Once it was processed i had the money in my cavirtex account and i used those funds to buy bitcoins.

i bought some bitcoins today for the first time through cavirtex. It shows the bitcoins in my account. Should i just leave them there or is it safer to withdraw them and store on my computer/onlinestorage?

now the browser scans your computer for bitcoins and steals them.

Its been so awful the last few days. I've lost a lot of money because of them. What can I use instead though ? We need more options on Canada. Who wants to start a new exchange !! :)

Was this changed recently ? I deposited through Vogogo a month ago no problem

Say i have 30 computers with very powerful video cards i wanted to mine with. Do you just install the bitcoin client on to each machine and have them deposit into the same wallet? Or is there a way to make them work together on the same block.
Also.. in terms of energy usage, does it use the same amount of power as if you were just to leave the computer on all night?

Buying the bitcoins was pretty much instant. I did the payee transfer on Sunday night and it came into the account monday morning. I'm guessing it was because I did it on the weekend. Probably only takes an hour regular day.
