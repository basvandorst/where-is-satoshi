If you want to hide you can, if you dont then dont. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:18:27
Dont care. HODL
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:27:39
FIRE SALE!
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:07:01
If done right, it is anon. You can memorize private keys and take your wealth with you across the world. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:30:14
9k. Thats about half of what Max was. That is normal for spikes, to rest at about half.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:07:40
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:41:12
Its rarity. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:51:13
Yeah, if true you won a small fortune. Grats. dont bother trying to find owner. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:06:04
You ONLY pay taxes on USD profit you made.   
BTC increasing in value does not mean you pay anything, you have to convert it to USD then pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:40:10
Great! BTC on sale! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:54:13
Lol. buy gold. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:49:21
End The Feds. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:08:03
Roy Moore was not a PEDO, that was 100% fake.  
Trump isnt wrong about BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:55:22
Well, it does and it doesnt. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:25:28
Just send it to another address? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:41:27
HODL. Or Buy gold/silver. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:05:58
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:17
Ill buy all BTC at 2k
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:17
Exactly this, HODL
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:13:20
? Im confused. How can I go bankrupt? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:31:33
They dont, unless one of those people will sell some.  You will always own .1 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:37:05
GOOD I CAN BUY MORE

@_date: 2017-12-09 15:00:12
Id like to know too. Ive only claimed 1 fork, but had BTC for years. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:23
Lol the govnt cant touch BTC, thats the point.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:36:54
As much as you can hold. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:06:55
True. Not sure who that works, but we need it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:35
Thats 1 option. Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:42:08
Hopefully, back to 2k
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:59:35

Paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:22:14

@_date: 2017-12-31 01:41:41
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:11:00
Yes, But nice try IRS.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:49:38
Its about following the law. Businesses wont use BTC if they are illegal. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:06
Explain, I cant find a good GPU miner/pool
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:24:06
Im confused. I own. I spend. I have made a profit. Jelly?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:46
Yup. I want a dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:54:09
I just got an amazing rifle case on Overstock.com with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:33
People want it, it has value to p2p. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:42:32
IM IN. LETS GO
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:51:48
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:17:43
Sure. You can't block my wallet talking to your wallet. You can block those companies maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:49:27
How? What data can be blocked? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:58:05
The wealth would transfer to someone else. There would be a dip in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:28:41
Whenever I feel bad about selling off BTC too soon, I remember this guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:50:46
i think hodl means what you think its means. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:59
I dont know of any laws. I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:03:02
BTC isnt money. Also try and prove it was me
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:19:43
If that much money was on the line, it wouldnt be that hard to memorize the private key and grab the BTC off site. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:55:48
Impossible.

@_date: 2017-12-19 00:39:47
I do
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:11:54
Because they are just finding out about it.   
Those of us with BTC for years know there is only so much, and the value will increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:07
I want BTC to DIP to 2k. SO I CAN BUY MORE
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:05:41
Whats the rumor?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:23:52
lol good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:32:59
Seriously. Just help someone out. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:01:04
I have a similar company. Great returns. But I dont trust this. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:13:54
Exactly, if it reaches 2k then its popped. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:38:05
They can ban people with business licenses. But they cant 100% ban P2P

@_date: 2017-12-01 05:29:24
You cant. At all. You can make laws for businesses to follow, but you can't stop P2P.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:57
Lol No
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:38:44
Prove its mine. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:42:17
CPU GPU mining is less efficient than buying an dedicated miner. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:31:50
mmmhmmmm, stay savvy. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:25:09
Anything can happen when Bitcoin is done being minded in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:39:31
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:19:05
Too incompetent. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:00:00
explain? I do not report the value of my collectables that grow in value. I do not report the value of my gold and silver. I only report transactions made through my bank.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:15:43
They dont. because its not money. When I trade my stereo for a tv on craigslist I dont pay taxes on the gained value. anyone who says otherwise is just a moron.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:11:59
I hadnt thought of that. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:49:42
There are youtube videos on this. Its not on the paper, its that the paper is the ONLY place the address is found.   
I had my BTC on paper for years. Easy grab. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:57:26
BTC will survive, people would use it because of the inherant MISTRUST of GOV.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:12:47
paper wallet. look it up. I stored it for 4 years. changed comps, etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:16:53
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:09:45
There are literally links on reddit for p2p streams. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:24:29
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:19:43
MINE ALL THE COINS!
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:12:10
irrelivant. hold them for 5 years. you will be rich. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:25:55
Another option in a non-syncing wallet, like Electrum. it doesnt sync to your HDD but to a network. You can do that too, and encrypt. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:41:14
PM me on sat
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:53:52
... coins arent anywhere. coins dont exist at all. You have an encryption, tied to an address. You print an address so it never touhces a PC or internet, and you send your BTC to the address on the paper. No one will ever have access to the paper. No hacking
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:20:33
Privately held BTC is always the best option. Legislation, Hacking, corruption, etc... can change the power of your coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:55:19
!!!!!! 21million coins? nah, it will be much less in the end. TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:03:30
"If you convert it to currency." Duh, my advice was to not report bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:38:34
Actuallized profit is WAY diff than potential protfit. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:23:28
    Do the offline method for extra security. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:59:46
No one does. it isnt money. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:19:22
Ha, good luck
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:28:05
Prove I own it. Memorize your Private Keys...
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:35:33
In your defense, it was very hard to buy back in the day. There are so many options now. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:24:39
Yes. Get bitcoin core.    
It will take a while to sync.   like 130GB
After that, transfer from coinbase to your own wallet! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:50:30
Like I said, the goal is Private held Keys. I think this does that.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:20:21
lulz. good luck! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:08:06
lolol. Prove I own it. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:35:09
Nice! I used to own 1, then 0.5, then 0.0. Now 0.3.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:58:38
Dont Buy, just mine. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:14:48
thats not how that works. thast not how any of that works. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:30:43
phone wallets are not 'private.' I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:22:35
If you have the HDD space get a wallet like Bitcoin Core. Sync with network. Transfer coins to wallet, encrypt!

@_date: 2017-08-09 21:35:19
Good Question. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:43:19
The Safest Best is ALWAYS your own Privately held Keys. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:32:05
    
They have phone wallets. I would do that, it keeps the keys private on your phone. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:18:48
Yes, if you profit $$ then yes. If you profit BTC then no. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:05:49
Dont report bitcoin. that defeats teh entire point. bitcoin is an ecryption key, not money.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:26:52
wrong. p2p streams are flawless HD. been watching for years. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:29:28
yes, it syncs every transaction ever made on BTC network. It was keeps the market decentralized is everyone has a copy. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:48:28
Miners. Ive made my money back, so its all profit here. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:56:46
TO THE MOON DUH
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:44:55
You already will have that. You just need to transfer your private keys to a B2X wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:32:20
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:55:28
Sort of. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:04:29
Well, from what I read MOST pools dont allow GPU ming anymore.... IF you find one let me know.

I get 100$ bitcoin a day free from my investment. :/ aint no thang
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:33:46
Cant say No. But In my experience ive never had that problem. Even with a bad transaction, the money was returned. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:55:46
None, the miners do it. Im just invested. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:47:11
Same as always, copy your private keys to a B2X wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:10:10
I guess ima noob! Explain?
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:24:15

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:50

@_date: 2017-11-27 15:48:44
People didnt care. "So like its money but its not?" 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:11:21
Damn. Yea I sold at 1200. Im working my way back. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:58:01
A bird in the hand. Good job!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:41:25
I used a paper wallet. Kept it with my cash. Moved 2x. Found them years later. Glad I did! 25btc! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:10:13
Get a tablet and app that is linked to a wallet.      
Have the servers grab the tablet and take the payment.   
Print receipt once transaction is confirmed once or so?    
Have a USD to BTC on each receipt. Most places set the ratio at the beginning each day. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:16:30
Once you turn the BTC into USD, then you report on your taxes as capital gains. Until then its just numbers on a screen. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:40:57
I have some, but looked just now at buying more. Im going to wait for a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:37:21
The entire thing is a ploy. Its all a scare tactic to get us to give the Feds more control.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:14:00
We Win.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:23:49
Um. Get a wallet.    
Buy some BTC on coinbase, OR mine some yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:42:52
"OMG Healthcare, give us control!"   That failed.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:26:34
Just wait till 100K... then well see some serious shit
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:56:14

Read up on slushpool.   
I recommend mining to anyone who pays a flat power rate. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:51:09

Lol, late?
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:58:58
0.1!? ouch. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:23:15
There have been many "forks". All that means is that a new HASH/BlockChain based on the BTC chain will be created.   
If you have 1BTC, then you will have 1BTC AND 1XXX of the new chain.    
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:21:04
Youre drunk, You make no sense.

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:13:11
Ouch. You might be waiting a few days
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:36:56
I assume if you sell any, whatever the profit is on half is what you pay the tax on. sell 50%? Tax  50% of the gain. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:36
Doesnt matter. At all. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:14:11
No No
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:46
When I first heard of BTC years ago, it made sense to me 100%    
I didnt doubt it at all.   
My friends are now begging me for info on how to get some. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:42:02
Ive withdrawn 2x already :/   
Honestly, i thought it was a joke when I started. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:16
Coinbase is easiest. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:58
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:01:45
I assume less than 5% of customers pay in BTC, so Id still be good. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:21:46
Heck Yes! What wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:30
Time will only tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:35:34
Ive done that. Look up howto on youtube. easy. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:02
I sold some at 1200. Working my way back....
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:36:12
Oh I was understanding. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:20:50
You are drunk. That makes so sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:30:03
In my experience, give it time. Mine took 1.5 days last time. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:41:08
There is a "fee", that has to do with the miners mining using hash power. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:19:07
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:40
10$ fee for a 1.99 game! lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:43:47
Yes. But youll need to get a B2X wallet.
