Not quite, think of this way instead: You have a "savings" account which is just a normal BTC wallet. Then you have your everyday "cash" in a "hot wallet". This hot wallet is actually just an open payment channel to some node that also has many other open payment channels, so you can route your way through that to anyone that's connected. This BTC will be instantly spendable to anyone you are able to route to. Ideally, everyone will be interconnected in some way which is why there most likely will be big "hubs" that you can open payment channels with. Some people fear this because of the centralization. I don't know enough about it to have an opinion about that.
It's basically the equivalent of withdrawing and depositing cash from and to your bank account. You'll still need to wait for confirmation and pay a normal transaction fee when "withdrawing" or "depositing", but you can make any amount of transactions with your "withdrawn" BTC as you desire at an extremely low cost.

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:04:06
Yeah, I think misunderstood, as far as I remember, Back was just clarifying that this is still *Bitcoin*; you're not converting to some alt-coin to do this or anything. At any time, you can close your channel and use your coins on-chain again.

Yes, the only thing that can give anyone control of your money is your private key. Don't share that with anyone.

I'm not that guy, but it's very simple: It's a good idea if you can time it properly, but there's no guarantee you will.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:15:56
Yes, I've found it hard to find information regarding this as well. There's really no problem in saying that it's not been solved yet, we'd just like to know.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:56:04
No, that's not good! It's very important that you know what a private key is! The private key is the only thing that gives you access and control over your Bitcoin. Lose your private key, and you lose your Bitcoin. You might have your Bitcoin on an exchange in which case you don't have a private key. But in that case, it's also not really *your* Bitcoin, so I'd advise you to research wallets and then withdraw your Bitcoin as soon as possible after that so YOU are in control. That's one of the main points of Bitcoin anyway :-)
A good place to start is searching on YouTube for Andreas Antonopolous and searching for some of his videos on how to store and secure your Bitcoin. He also has lots of other very interesting talks.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:56:23


No, it's widely agreed that the blocksize should be increased. The controversy was *when* and *how*, not *if*. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:02:49
No, because you're not actually just devoting that money to coffee. Assuming that you and/or the coffee shop have open payment channels to others which have open payment channels to others and so forth, you can route payments to anyone connected in one way or another. That means that what you're actually "depositing" is just how many coins you have reserved for instant spending *anywhere*. Basically like withdrawing cash to be able to spend immediately. You can at any point close the payment channel and you will then receive whatever amount is owed to you on a blockchain transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:10:23
Merchants will definitely be able to open nodes that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:21:14
Yeah, you can, but making wild unsubstantiated claims is not discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:30:27
1) Noone really knows. There are very skilled people working hard on the technology and the implementation, but there's still a long way to go. Hopefully people will be able to start using it on a normal basis during 2018. I'd rather have a good system than a rushed one though. Technically, you *can* use it on the mainnet now, but there aren't any nodes and it's also very risky since it's still early in development. As far as I know, calculating optimal routes to the destination is still an ongoing issue and is a big part of the system.
2) Well, that really depends on the implementation for whatever wallet you're going to use. When you open a payment channel you're just depositing Bitcoin into a separate multisig address, just like if you were using several addresses for different things. In the beginning it will be far from trivial to set it up, but there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to hide all of the technicalities underneath in the future so the user doesn't have to think about anything but putting in the payment request to pay or scanning a QR code and clicking "confirm". I think the approach that a lot of wallets will take is showing two different kinds of "accounts" to the user: spending and savings. Savings are just normal wallets like we use them now, while the spending account is an open payment channel to some lightning node.. In fact, if LN becomes successful, it will probably be because of an implementation like that.
3) I actually don't know if there are similar 2nd-layer technologies being developed on top of Bitcoin now. There's the equivalent for Ethereum which is called Raden, I think, but I don't know much about that. As far as I know, it's basically the same thing just for ETH instead. However, there are *many* things being researched and developed to scale Bitcoin, but a lot of it is still very technical and hard to explain. Look up things like Bloom filters, Schnorr signatures and drivechains (from the top of my head). Also, look up the effects of blocksize increases and why Bitcoin hasn't done it (yet) and why the other coin has (writing it like that so my comment won't have to go through moderation..). The discussions about blocksize isn't as black and white as *either* "side" would have you believe.
Basically, while LN shows signs of being a great technology, we aren't putting all our eggs in one basket and just counting on that. In fact, I'd say that relying solely on a 2nd-layer solution for the future of Bitcoin isn't a very good idea. Luckily, on-chain developments continue as normal and interesting ideas are being researched. However, in Bitcoin these things take time, and they always take longer than you want them to. Some of the reasons for that are the conservative nature of the developers, since we're dealing with a currency which is still far bigger than any other coin. On top of that, hard forks are, by design, extremely difficult and risky to do because you need wide consensus. Take a look at what happened with 2x when they tried to fork off even after the cancellation: it simply didn't work. Think about the disaster it would be if we were to deploy a hard fork that wasn't tested to the absolute highest requirements. That's much easier to do in an altcoin which is why Bitcoin can, at times, seem incredibly slow and archaic (in relation to other coins) in development. Again, this is a feature, not a bug. But, of course, that doesn't mean that it prevents other coins from "catching up" and surpassing Bitcoin. But in that case, they, too, would get to a point where implementation of new features will stagnate simply due to the size and difficulty of gaining consensus when making changes. 
So while it may seem like some coins are catching up rapidly to Bitcoin, know that it becomes exponentially harder to keep improving at a steady pace as a coin grows. I actually kind of hope we'll have a few coins get to the size of Bitcoin over the next few years because then we'd really see which comes out on top in a level playing field.
Anyway, this kind of siderailed. I really should go celebrate christmas now haha. Happy everything!

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:41
What do you mean? People are buying/selling at 17,5 at Gdax. So it's completely accurate. Other exchanges might be selling for lower. Generally Gdax seems to always be in front of these bull runs. Due to arbitrage, exchanges will even out when the price is more calm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:40:54
This isn't the first time that you were able to sort of fit this onto a BTC/USD chart. I'm not saying you couldn't be right, and the current price bubble could certainly burst, but we've seen this many times before, and so far we've always recovered. We'll see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:06:29
Interesting. It makes complete sense that the money you've deposited into a payment channel can increase, since it's just a multisig address that anyone can send to via a normal on-chain transaction. But I don't see how you can actually pull money out of the payment channel without closing the channel completely. That seems to go against the very design of the payment channels since those.
That also raises another question that I haven't thought about before: How do the users of a payment channel decide how any surplus of money will be divided once the payment channel closes if someone deposits more money into the multisig address? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:47:53
It is, and it certainly isn't the only solution being worked in. On-chain scaling solutions are also needed, we just want to make sure it's done right.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:34:50


Well, I'm not sure if that's even a decidedly bad thing. This technology is incredibly complex, and therefore changing *anything* is something that could have major implications on the system as a whole. Having a reddit discussion with 98% individuals just echoing the opinions of someone else without even having a decent understanding of the technology isn't really that constructive (this statistic is pulled straight from my butt of course). I'm not saying it's a bad thing if we had more technical discussions, definitely not! And hopefully it would educate the average user a bit more. I'm just saying that this is usually not the best place to discover the research and developments being done, and to get a good understanding of the benefits and the downsides of, say, increasing the blocksize. And there's nothing wrong with that.
The core development process is completely open and transparent, and is a much better place to find qualified discussions about these things. Check out 
Most of the stuff is gibberish to me, but I try to learn a little bit every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:01:48
Well, ideally this will reduce the strain on the blockchain significantly, thereby also reducing the on-chain fees. And also, this isn't a replacement for on-chain scaling. Raising the block size for example isn't really a controversial issue, it's the discussion of when and how that turned sour. 


I guess, kind of. However, it might be hard to find routes for large amounts since the connected hubs will need to have at least that amount of BTC "funded" to their payment channel.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:30:23
Well, look, every community has assholes. And there's no doubt that Dogecoin is *appealing* to a lot of immature people who can't tell the difference between having fun on and harassing people on other subreddits. But they represent the minority luckily. 
This is exactly what happens when you post a Youtube link on Reddit as well. The minority of immature assholes stick out like a sore thumb by posting "le reddit army" in the YT comments. Don't judge a tree by the rotten fruits on the ground.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:23:39
To be fair, this wouldn't really be anything out of the ordinary. Many websites already do this to see which parts of the site are focused on the most (as the cursor often follows your eye movements or something like that)
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:40:35
There is a psychological aspect here which has been one of the issues for Bitcoin for a long time. And that's the fact that you have to dig into decimals in order to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin. I know you can start naming the decimal points things like "Satoshi" etc., but those are all patches on worn out pants. 
That's what Litecoin tried to fix. By providing the silver to the gold. Doge is even further down on that chain. And now it isn't finite anymore. At least in theory. It certainly isn't deflationary, but it could get close to being non-flationary as lost coins are made up for. Mind you, this doesn't really compare to the central bank's monetary inflation. 5 Billion DOGE a year forever is what is going to be pumped into the market. At some point, that will be close to nothing, but it would still act as a kind of prevention towards the "why spend it now, when it could be worth much more in the future?"-attitude. 
But who really knows? Let's see what happens when a coin reaches its cap.

@_date: 2014-02-02 19:28:00
This thread really grinds my gears, and especially this comment. I'm very sorry, but you just classified the quickest growing altcoin as being for "children" based on the fact that they made a decision *requested by the community* in order to ensure that Doge won't be a place for hoarding and holding, but instead make it a currency meant for lots of transactions. 
I don't think you intended to be rude, so sorry if I overreacted a little. However, the title of this thread really didn't serve as a good way to start an unbiased and reasoned discussion. And that's what's lacking in a lot of these comments: **reason**. Why aren't we discussing the potential consequences of this decision instead of just going mad about something that won't affect most of you? Why aren't people even considering the fact that this might actually *be a good thing*?
While I agree that the two coins are in entirely different ballparks, labelling one as the "serious" one is absolute nonsense, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them living happily alongside each other some day. Dogecoin is a very serious and exciting thing, but for different reasons than Bitcoin.
So I think we need to quit this *Dogecoin is a joke and only for kids, Bitcoin is the real deal*-attitude and start realizing that there is a place for both.
This comment has not been in a very shibe-spirit, so I need to compensate for that. If you want to join, here is a little to get started :-)

I'm sorry you look at it that way. It was simply a bit of self-deprecating fun. I don't see how I was trying to start a tip chain (which I didn't), it was *one* tip. I wouldn't call that splooging doge all over the thread.

@_date: 2014-02-02 21:47:17
Well, time will show. I get what you're saying about the meme thing, but while that's often what makes people get into dogecoin, the incredible positivity of the community is what makes people stay. 
And I totally agree that it's all about taking the serious out of serious business - but that stilll leaves the "business" part. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:57:23
It will stabilize naturally. As long as it's not at all profitable, people will stop mining until the hashrate is so low that it's actually profitable again.

@_date: 2014-03-17 15:56:41
Well, those statistics are seriously affected by the massive increase in value since last year. It would probably still be bigger though, but not by this much.
EDIT: Unless they count the amount in USD from the value at the time of each respective tip.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:52:47
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that, I was just trying to straw-man you.
And well.. I do think it is as valid as any other altcoin out there atm (save the biggest ones). Whether it will stay that way, only time can say.
Thanks for the tip!

Dude, it's a *bit* - that's a thing that can only have one of two values. It's a coin about a bit. Don't get so uptight.
See how that doesn't make sense? Yes, dogecoin is based upon the meme and it's an ongoing theme in the community. But it's still just as valid as any other coin.

I don't agree with everything Ron Paul says, but I really respect every single word that comes out of his mouth. It seems like it's very well thought out, and that he knows just how much of a stance he has in every situation.
Of course, he will use this opportunity to oppose regulation, but at the same time, he fairly admits that he doesn't know how Bitcoin works, and also/therefore doesn't want to mess with it. Let's just see how everything works out on its own.
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:13:56
I think it's got a lot more to offer. The community is extremely nice and enthusiastic. Yes, people might get tired of the meme in the long run, but I think Doge is here to stay. At least for a good while.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:57:40
Well, I was referring more to the technical aspects. But yeah.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:57:21


I should also note that I have no idea what Ron Paul is usually like. I can barely keep up with the politics in my own country. I just like the way he talks in the few videos I've seen him in. That's all I really wanted to convey.

@_date: 2014-03-08 20:48:47
I agree, however he's still not quite knowledgeable on the technical details. And any kind of uncertainty is a very dangerous thing in politics, so I admire the fact that he chooses to just let it sail its own waters instead of panic-regulating it.

Noone knows, but there's still the possibility of a BTC dip after the fork. I've got some more FIAT lined up if that happens.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:34:23
That strategy is fine if you know when you're at the bottom. Thing is, you don't. You might be right, you might not. If one really believes in the future of Bitcoin, I don't think it's really worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:13:21
The most sane advice will always be something like the following. Doesn't mean you have to follow it, but you'll be taking more risks if you don't:
* Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Think of the amount you think you can afford to lose. It's probably around half of that in reality.
This serves two purposes: You won't be left with nothing if everything tanks AND you're less inclined to sell it all during dips since you're not relying on the money.
* Buy the dips!!
We're in a high right now, and while noone knows how far we will rise before the next drop, most of the time it's worth waiting for the drop again. Of course, if you're in this for the really long term and you believe Bitcoin can realize its potential, buying now or trying to wait for $3500 won't make much of a difference in the end, but if you're really looking to maximize your profits, you'll be better off waiting for a drop most of the time. It's hard not to FOMO, but being patient is an extremely undervalued skill when trying to buy-in. 
Or, alternatively, dollar cost average where you buy a bit of Bitcoin maybe once a day or once a week. That's also a very sane way to do it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:45:16
Where did you get the impression that they were trying to disguise that?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:34:23
That strategy is fine if you know when you're at the bottom. Thing is, you don't. You might be right, you might not. If one really believes in the future of Bitcoin, I don't think it's really worth the risk.

Truth is, noone knows. We all gamble on different conclusions drawn from vague information from parties with many different agendas. My gamble is on the fact that the markets will soon learn that the closure of BTCC was voluntary and that the other exchanges are running fine. I spent the rest of the money I had saved for BTC right now. It might go lower, it might not. It might tank completely, it might skyrocket. I'm in it for the long run, and I have a feeling that watching the charts rise and fall each day, trying to guess the bottom of the dip and buy in, will only make me insane. 
I'm invested in the technology and the potential in Bitcoin. And if the potential is ever fully realized, the value of BTC right now is nothing compared to what it will be in the future.

I'm DCA'ing all the way down to the 100-day moving average which is about 2800 EUR or ~3300 USD because that's where the last support was. However, if it breaks that, I agree that it'll probably go under 3K. Unless something crazy happens in the next few weeks (which isn't impossible in this world), I do think that'll be a very good price to buy in. I'm saving some FIAT to buy in case that happens.
