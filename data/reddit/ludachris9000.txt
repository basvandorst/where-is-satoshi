Thanks. 
Seems like many to choose from

TL;DR wants free bitcoins 
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:03:56
Had no idea there were so many!
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:56:16
If you are willing to wait the allotted time PayPal allows before a refund request I will gladly do it. Looks like it's 60 days unfortunately. At 60 days I will send you the equivalent in btc. 
Does anyone see a problem with this?
It doesn't mean a thing saying it on here but I'll do it for you.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:07:29
Oh do tell wise one. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:59:45
Good catch thanks 
@_date: 2016-08-13 11:36:40
Thank you for that. 
Too bad everyone can't get on the same page and make one badass coin. 
Appreciate the insight 
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:48:19
Thank you. That's very interesting. 
When you say solutions are on the way, is it something simple or is it something major that has to be decided upon?
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:02:31
Wow thanks! That's cool
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:44:44
But to replace/ compete with current day currency, wouldn't we be better off having one that does it all?
Smart transaction/ decentralized/ mega crypto. Wouldn't that be the best?
50 different coins makes it hard to know where o put your $$
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:10:45
Ok man. I understand. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:38:11
Sorry. Fixed it. Yes that's it, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:55:14
I don't know why I watched all of that, but I did and I loved it. ����

This thread will be removed in....5-4-3.....
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:23:34
Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:57:37
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:48:42
Good point. Maybe Coinbase will chime in on this. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:37:13
The disappearing concept sounds accurate.
However this is what's on the website regarding the keys. 
"The multisig vault is created by intelligently distributing three keys, two of which are required to unlock your funds. Coinbase securely stores one key, you store a backup user key, and both Coinbase and you store an encrypted third key, which can only be unlocked with a password you know. Because Coinbase never learns your password and never learns your user key, Coinbase never gains access to your funds."
"However, if you forget your passphrase and lose your personal key, your funds will be lost forever. In this case it is impossible for Coinbase to redeem your funds."
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:06:26
But what about the US straight up banning BC?
Just  like they banned owing gold for a period. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:07:28
1 seed or many?
Do I just have to keep track of 1 number?
I don't want a notebook full of numbers. Thanks
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:53:57
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:16:05
More people are buying it. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:22:53
That number is all relative I guess. 
The trezor sounds great, but seems like a pain in the ass. I've never seen how one works however. I'm sure it's not as confusing as it sounds. 
If I want to buy something with BC and I have a trezor, but it's not with me?
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:19:59
I'm not very organized, and am way better at misplacing things than keeping things. Thanks for the insight. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:08:58
What if my house burns down?
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:55:53
Local bitcoin is like 70$ over the spot price right now. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:29:31
Ok thanks. 
Appreciate all the insight
@_date: 2016-06-24 10:44:01
Totally agree. Is there any agreement on a worthy exchange right now?
Coinbase has a multisig vault, and is ridiculously easy to use for me, a new BC fan. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:18:53
Great. Appreciate it!
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:49:30
Great catch. Hopefully we hear something from Coinbase on this. Interested to hear their take. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:39:14
And the average joe will be able to just jump on the LN no prob?
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:50:53
Any it’s any different here?
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:43:43
That would be nice. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:40:20
Very insightful, thanks for the input. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:25:39
Lower fees
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:57:15
Thank you. I am actually lol'n
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:03:11
Yes. Like not allowing banks to do business with medical marijuana buisnesses, or something along those lines. If the government outlawed BC, all major US companies would have to stop accepting it. Then you you could only spend BC between users or participating countries. 
I can see the fed doing something like this if they start to lose control. The only way they are staying in business is being able to print their own fiat. If they see that power slipping they have to make a move. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:48:37
Guess you could go here and see what you find. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:37:35
Don’t forget fungible! Since you’re making a list. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:15:20
Not what I said. Cash (USD) to crypto. 
I have no issues exchanging after that. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:47:07
Ah that makes sense. I still think Wall Street will try and stick with the usual setup instead of actually purchasing the asset. We will see I guess. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:47:20
I don't disagree with the but.... Let's say USA declares BC counterfeit. Federal prison to those that use it. 
How many people are really going to use it then? Some will, a lot won't. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:40:00
Ok I think you put an order at $298. That will never fill. You basically said “when bitcoin drops to $289 buy!”
You need to cancel that and buy at market price for a total of $300. It’s the second box I think. I’m not near my computer. You can send that to any wallet as son as your pre-credited funds clear. But you can buy bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:02:30
Same happened with gold ����
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:34:45
Cheeto Benito! ���� thanks. I lol'd

Also, I'm on an iPhone. No droid
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:14:59
What's the best way to do this with a trezor? Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:47:27
Paper bitcoin. Just a way to manipulate the price. Watch. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:47:56
Ok thanks. Appreciate the info 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:51:24
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:21:44
Someday that's likely to be true. ��
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:40:43
Paper gold can and is. Which is what they’ll try to do to bitcoin as well soon enough. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:02:59
Why are you scared of it?
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:55:33
BCH doesn’t solve this? Not shilling, honest question?
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:11:46
Valid point. 
I'm not sure I would sell during that time, but I do see what you're saying. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:38:58
I regularly send money via the app to friends for free. Zero charge and instant. 
I agree about the charge backs, and dislike having a 3rd party involved, but it’s a no brainer compared to bitcoin for basic transfers. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:10:13
Thanks. Is the purchasing fee pretty reasonable?
Also, can I ACH from my bank to Gemini. I joined Kraken but they want a wire. I don't want to have to goto my bank to wire money. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:53:18
If you were going to buy let’s say Tesla stock.....
And there was a 15 million dollar short, betting on a stock value decrease. How would you feel about purchasing that stock?
Btw, were talking about futures contracts, not etfs. 
Someone with say..... unlimited money could put a lot of money on the down side and control the market prices. 
It’s complicated for sure, but bitcoin in the trading centers is a terrible thing. Short term it may raise the price, but long term I see lots of shady shit happening. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:09:14
So how do I get my cash from my bank into said exchanges in the US? I checked a few and none are easy from what I've seen. I was using circle, but now I'm back to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:11:29
That’s really interesting. Thanks for posting that. Nice ELI5
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:58:36
I completely understand what you’re saying. The problem is leverage. People can leverage massive price moves with with a small percent of real money. I’m no expert, but when leverage get involved the actual value of things starts to get confusing. 
The point of bitcoin is to get away from all this bs. 
Also, Gemini for example is just as easy to purchase bitcoin as a futures contract. This solely for big money trading and manipulating. Watch n see. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:59:57
Huh? What’s the point of that?
This is just a way to manipulate the price. You can buy bitcoin just as easy as a futures contract. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:42:39
Thank you. I really appreciate that insight. It’s easy to think these guys are on to something sometimes. Maybe even get you second guessing yourself. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:41:12
This is why r/btc was created. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 18:56:57
Ok thank you! I'll check into it. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 14:51:53
How do I get out of this crappy company?
My work direct deposits there. 
All my bills are paid from there. 
I want out, but what's a better option?
Thanks for any insight. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:12:53
You’re right. I guess covering you’re eyes and saying “I don’t see anything” is the technique you’re gonna go with. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:19:31
Thanks. Only use the mobile app so haven’t seen that. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:52:14
Money has to be fungible. Bitcoin is not as of now.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:33:26
They got real bitcoin for it. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:05:42
Ok bud. Make it quick as this will be gone soon. 
And if it just did a bit of google searching you’d find plenty more

This is actually a very good interview. I don’t 100% agree with him, but he’s sure better than most talking heads. His point on another crypto coming along and replacing bitcoin almost happened.  I’m glad he was wrong, but he was pretty close. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:46:53
Exactly. People don't understand this. Gold/ silver is a perfect example.
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:54:49
Completely agree.
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:18:17
Thanks for the input. 
I don't want to stir up conspiracy theories etc... But it seems like as long as the bankers get involved there's scamming. 
This article explains how leveraged the Comex is as far as precious metals on a legitimate exchange. 
Is this a fact? I don't know, but I do hear about it a lot. 
Precious metal holders have been saying the same thing as Bitcoin holders. "If you don't hold it, you don't own it"
But once the bankers get involved they own it through manipulation and their unlimited bank account to short/ buy. 
I think the ETFs could easily mask the true value of BTC eventually. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 08:50:09
Or it would be like when the US outlawed Gold. Which wasn't that long ago. 
If it's a threat to their scam, they will do whatever they want. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:55:53
Petition to stop making petitions. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:50:27
No one actually knows for sure. That's all I was saying. 
Here's a quote from an article in Forbes. 
"Even though GLD is “physically backed,” ordinary investors can’t just go to London and redeem their bullion.  Only “authorized participants” are allowed to create or redeem shares.  Authorized participants are registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants which have entered into agreements with the trustee and sponsor (these include major Wall Street names like Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch-Bank of America, among others), allowing them to  deposit either gold or shares in exchange for the other at unallocated accounts until the operation is completed.
Regular shareholders have no rights of redemption and the gold is not required to be insured by the Trust, which is not liable for loss, damage, theft, nor fraud.  Shares are bought in the open market, only after Authorized Participants decide to place or sell them.  Therefore a retail investors doesn’t actually “own” gold, but an asset that is backed by gold and represents a certain quantity of the yellow metal.
Skeptics have raised doubts over the trust’s management of its physical gold, with questions over how much is actually held.  HSBC, the custodian, is very secretive regarding its vault.  Earlier this year, CNBC’s Bob Pisani was allowed to see the vault only after surrendering his cell phone and taken in a van with blacked out windows to an undisclosed location.  Once in the vault, Pisani held up a gold bar and explained they were all numbered and registered.  Astutely, ZeroHedge noted the bar Pisani held up was missing from the current bar list, fueling further speculation and skepticism."
Seems totally legit. ��
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:59:04
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:14:15
I don't think so. 
When I sign into CB I can view all the vaults and the wallet, and can move BC between them all without any need for my pass phrase. I know some will frown on that setup as CB stores the encrypted info on the site for convenience.  
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:52:33
The catch is the payout is in unlimited printed cash.
So they can literally have no gold and pay you in cash. 
The true value of the asset never appears if there is no seen shortage, since no one really needs to hold the physical metal. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:48:42
Interesting. That's good to know. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:46:49
Good point on Coinbase.
Can you elaborate on your Breadwallet example? I use that wallet since I'm an iPhone holder. What am I missing using them as my wallet? Trezor is in my future for storage, while using breadwallet for portable BTC. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:19:24
Ok thanks 
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:35:15
But you can with gold too. I mean not as easy as BTC, but still relatively easy.  
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:43:06
Thanks. Backup is backed up. ��
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:49:45
True, it is a pain to go buy it and then store it. I see your point. Logging into coinbase and setting up an account is easier. Average joe will always take the easiest route, so etrade ETF will probably be it I'd imagine. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:13:56
I'm totally not disagreeing with you. But as a newbie CB made it pretty simple for me. 
Now with the addition of the multisig wallet I have a hard time venturing off into random places to buy/sell, that I know nothing about, or can tell if it's a scam site or not. 
Example the link you provided bitsquare.io
How do I know it's safe to link a cash account to that site? I know nothing about it. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:31:57
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. I hadn't thought of that angle. You're absolutely right about the "trust me" part of the equation. There really is no way to tell what they are holding regarding gold, or oil, etc. 
What about a fund that purchases say 100 million btc, but then lends it out to multiple other leveraged funds? I'm sure someone is going to figure out legit scams when it come to this. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:15:20
What's "shift"
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:03:51

I was going to move a tiny bit as a test. 
But I don't even know where to move it to yet��
@_date: 2016-07-02 08:56:07
Thank you for that post. Many on here are really blind to this. If you ban millions of people from using BC, it will really take the wind out its sails. The US could easily get a large portion of Euro land and Japan to join in as well if they see it taking over. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:05:08
Yeah, I have no clue. But I'm not quite ready to move to and offline wallet so I figured I'd try this out. It looks a little over my head, but I haven't really invested any time into it yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:45:47
What if your loan came from a bitcoin whale? Then no mortgage. Would just be a loan to the whale. 
No bank. Just a thought.

Just like the white paper says. ��
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:17:37
I see, that makes a lot of sense. Great explanation.
So you only obtain/ verify your funds via core? I saw it required 65gb of space to run on a computer. Or is there something else you use?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:38:27
So Monero?
