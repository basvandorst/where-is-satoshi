 Everyone here who thinks OB will herald a truly free global market is going to be sorely disappointed. Where reputable cosigners are required for dispute resolution, the government will find its pressure point. The OB team themselves have said several times that it will not be a good solution for the black market or for tax avoidance. That's because all reputable arbitrators will be forced to follow government policy or be shut down. Anonymous arbitration will be outlawed and those that defy this will be hunted down and locked up just like Ross Ulbricht.

The point is he can't broadcast such a large block without paying a huge fee to everyone who forwards and stores it, thereby making it worthwhile to the nodes to store and forward it. The fact that it's "useless data" is irrelevant, because its obviously useful enough to that miner that he would pay exorbitant fees to get it propagated and included in the longest chain.
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:41:11
That is true, but maybe I'm missing your point. I don't see that as being a problem. The remaining miners may need to use extra bandwidth for a month, but then the difficulty would drop drastically, which would be great for them.

And what exactly do you mean by difficulty reset? The idea that we could manually lower the difficulty or reset it to 1 is preposterous. The next 2016 blocks would be found so quickly that the difficulty would immediately jump back up to where it is now. The only way to prevent that would be to alter the mining algorithm, which would annihilate all ASICs.

That is just plain nonsense. Plutonium isn't hard to trade for because of government controls. Plutonium is hard to trade for because its extremely difficult to produce and therefore extremely scarce. 
Obtaining plutonium by any means, including trade, is therefore highly unlikely. Obtaining other, more commonly occurring radioactive material isn't difficult at all.
Drugs on the other hand are not very scarce at all in comparison, because they are needed by humans everywhere and are produced in huge quantities relatively easily. Drugs are therefore easy for any determined person with a small amount of money to trade for, whether it be from a friend with a few extra pills, an 'unscrupulous' pharmacist or doctor, all the way down to a heroin dealer on the streets of the inner city.
@_date: 2015-06-26 09:58:35
OB may not be the best solution for a DNM but there is another project in this space that just might be.
Rather than one giant unified market, this software allows for many markets to run individually, even secretly, with completely customizable settings wrt reputation handling and such. And the network that it uses (Bitmesssage) is already built to be decentralized, anonymous, and it can work over Tor natively.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:28:48
The moment Gavin decided to implement his proposal on topof XT rather than core and started promoting the idea of forcing a hard fork onto a large minority that doesn't want it, he alienated most of the community by attempting to assert authority over the network. He ostracized himself and brought all of the hate and personal attacks on himself (not that I condone that sort of thing).

OB transactions are not anonymized in the first place.


Tell that to Ross Ulbricht
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:58:29
You don't seem to understand. There would be no protocol level block size limit in this scenario. Anyone who really wanted to propagate a any size transaction or block would be free to do so, provided that they add a sufficient fee, or find a node(s) that are willing to forward their message for free. This is the same way the current fee market for the inclusion of transactions in blocks by miners works currently.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:31:36
That's up to the governments in either jurisdiction. You can trust that these arbitrators will be heavily regulated similar to MSBs.

The BIP process works fine when people participate. And I'm not sure if you realize, but you generally have to fork a repo and 'patch' it before you can start a Pull Request. Gavin could merge the PR himself IIRC, but he should allow discussion of it on github I would think.
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:13:42
Nothing I said was about the blocksize. My issue with Gavin and Mike is their threat to try to force a hard fork on people using XT and superior cat-herding abilities.

I was totally unaware of this project..
I happen to be working on a similar project, but I use a different method of escrow.
There is a 'contingency clause'  that, in the case that there is a dispute between the buyer and seller, the buyer may issue a transaction after a specific amount of time, that will recover the escrowed funds and distribute them to both parties based on a previously agreed upon ratio.  
Other than that, there seems to be little fundamental difference between our systems, besides the fact that yours seems much further along in the development process. I'm not even finished with my command line based proof of concept.
If you're interested, i'd love to try to implement my scheme using your codebase rather than reinvent the wheel. Would you be willing consider incorporating that as an option in bitmarkets?

That is an extremely naive position to take. Pain is a massive part of the human experience; which means that inevitably, pain medications of all varieties will always be widely available. Whether they come from a licensed pharmacist, a dude on the street, or your mom's medicine cabinet, they're just not that hard to find.
People will get them and take them, and if they like the effects, people will get addicted. No amount of regulation, restriction, or outright prohibition will ever change that, or even hinder it significantly. What it will do is needlessly introduce and enrich entities like pharmacists, licencing bodies, enforcement agencies and countless others that do nothing but prop up pointless and impotent restriction regimes for their own profit. 
The end result is that the people who actually need the drugs have to jump through pointless hoops and pay toll to these gatekeepers just to purchase simple substances that they need to live their lives.


They're not. Realistically speaking, substances are typically much easier to obtain for people that don't need them than for people that do.
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:21:42
Obviously you can never ensure that everyone becomes educated about anything. There is no course of action that can ensure people won't take drugs they don't need, and there never will be. Bearing that fact in mind, I say the best course of action is the one that preserves the most liberty for the people.

[I ask why...](
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:27:11
My experience is not universal, no. But the phenomenon of pain is universal among humans, and so is pain relieving medicine. And anywhere there are painkillers, there are addicts, because distribution controls, where they exist, are trivial to circumvent.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:40:32
The point is the addicts are going to do whatever they have to do to get the drugs. It doesn't matter how inconvenient you make it for them. All you're doing is making things more difficult and expensive for everyone else.
And that extra expense for everyone is really the whole point.
Somebody somewhere (big pharma) is making a lot of money off of this problem while doing nothing to alleviate it.

Obviously you have no evidence that your argument is true either. Because you haven't magically traveled to an alternate universe where antibiotics are somehow unlimited.

@_date: 2015-05-29 01:25:57


Absolutely correct. This means that the use of antibiotics, no matter how limited or restricted, will eventually, inexorably lead to the evolution of these super strains. These bugs will absolutely arise and wreak havoc on humanity sooner or later. Thus these laws are eating away at our collective freedom while only offering to delay the inevitable.
Obviously the only hope to prevent the rise of the drug resistant superbugs is to go back in time and prevent antibiotics from ever being invented. This is exactly as likely to happen as the effective enforcement of any form of drug policy.

Of course its enough. Its not that difficult to walk up to someone on the street that you know has drugs and ask to buy some. Its the people doing the selling that take the real risks because they want that money.

METAmarket: Trustless Federated Marketplaces
METAmarket is an open source protocol and proof-of-concept reference client specifying a trustless federated marketplace which uses Bitcoin as a universal currency and Bitmessage as a P2P communication network. Time-locked refund transactions ensure that incentives are aligned toward completing the trade without the need for trusted third parties. Systemic vulnerabilities such as transaction malleability are mitigated through the use of a federated reputation model.

@_date: 2017-03-02 19:04:04
The only consensus required by bitcoin is among the nodes not the people. When you have disagreement over design, you fork the protocol and if your network is legitimately better, people will use it instead. That's how open source software works.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:35:55
What I'm saying is that there is no solution. Obviously you missed that. Addiction will not and cannot be controlled, so educating people about addiction and treating addicts is the only way to help the addicts. Because there will always be addicts.
So rather than giving up liberty for something that may or may not be slightly effective, I think humanity would be much better off retaining their liberty.
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:31:14
Actually that is the point. We don't 'create' or 'prevent' addiction by 'setting policy' because the notion that policies of restriction or prohibition are effective is well known to be ridiculous based on decades of empirical evidence.
Addiction is a disease. It's going to happen just as much if not more if we try to prohibit substances. The only way to deal with addiction is by treating addicts.
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:51:59

Right the point that you're missing somehow is that those sellers would have to have "bought previously".

Price may not be the only measure of success, but those metrics don't qualify as measures of success or failure at all. Your premise that more transactions means more success is completely false.
Bitcoin's most important use case right now is as a store of value. I have personally been using bitcoin for that purpose for many years. I can count the number of transactions I've made in the past year on one hand, but I'm still a bitcoin user. Your stats are meaningless.

This is where you lost me. People that have not yet adopted bitcoin don't own any. People that have adopted bitcoin necessarily do own some. Therefore more adoption = more buying. You can't sell something that you don't own yet, so the people that adopt and then sell have to also have bought at some point, the people that adopt and don't sell have to have bought and not sold, leaving a net increase in buying activity overall as adoption increases.

Bitcoin was designed to transfer value from one place to another, not to bounce value between addresses in the same wallet controlled by a single entity for the sole purpose of expending the resources of the network. This type of flooding or DoS attack can certainly harm the network by crashing nodes and inflating tx fees artificially.
Having said that, I do agree that there is no way to effectively prevent these attacks without harming the network even more so. There is no way to filter txs and we shouldn't even try, but that doesn't mean that the purpose of many of the txs being processed recently isn't specifically to try to cripple the network and do harm to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has no single definition. Good luck forcing your own definition on everyone else.
If you're a dev, create a altcoin/hardfork and hope people buy it. If you're a miner, hash on the chain you prefer and hope people buy it. If you're neither, sell your coins and hope people follow your lead.
Beyond those options, you are utterly powerless, and your opinion doesn't matter. 
Not even Satoshi Nakamoto's definition matters now. Even if he came out of hiding, he would have those same options.

You keep using this word "consensus". I don't think that you know what it means in this context.
In bitcoin, consensus among developers is basically meaningless. In bitcoin, consensus is an emergent property of the opinion of the investors/hodlers. Ultimately, people deciding that a specific chain with specific protocol rules is worth investing in, is the only thing that gives that particular chain's tokens value.

Sophisticated vendors will create several tiers of offers. Cheaper offers with lower ratios being reserved for buyers with good rep.
@_date: 2015-08-31 16:27:55
There is an economic incentive for buyers to finalize properly and thereby build a reputation. Vendors give each offer a minimum rep requirement. This means that as buyers gain reputation they will be allowed to view offers with better deals. Whereas allowing payments to expire results in negative feedback and could even block the buyer until they burn BTC to increase their rep.

I don't believe that Bit message was "hacked" or that it is insecure, but you don't need to rely on the security of Bit message per se. As far as proof of work goes, this form of communication is not meant to be instant. Bad ux complaints about bit message typically stem from a poor understanding of the basic assumptions and purpose of the network.

You're contradicting yourself. Fungibility means that it doesn't matter where your coins came from, they're all the same. Not to mention that the whole point of CoinJoin/Joinmarket is to obscure the links between groups of inputs and outputs, meaning that nobody could link the input that came from the drugs dealer to any specific output in the tx.
Read up, man. You're embarrassing yourself.
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:12:32
Just because facts are consistent and repeatable doesn't make them "dogma" lol.
Oh and market cap =/= network effect. Bitcoin has the network it has because (like any currency) people believe in its utility and that it's fundamental properties make it desireable as a currency. Obviously people have much less faith in the properties and value of Doge, which is why this theoretical billion are would never dare touch it or any other shitcoin for that matter.
And about being greedy? Trust me, since I actually understand the concept of network effect, I'm not the least bit worried. What I don't like is when people go around spouting falsehoods in public trying to pump some retarded shitcoin.

Repeat, "Just repeating yourself with nothing to back it up again? Some people just can't admit when they're wrong.
Coinjoin methods are not a fungibility problem, they're the solution."
Just repeating phrases like "observable gateway" is useless and intentionally misleading. Gateway implies the BTC is passing through the wallet of a known entity (ie a mixer), which doesn't happen in a CoinJoin because there is no entity doing the mixing. The only way to blacklist coins now that CoinJoin is in use is to blacklist every single output of every single CJ transaction. This kind of policy is obviously and completely untenable.

I'm not saying that sidechains aren't riddled with issues, but they're the only way to legitimately try new features in cryptocurrency.

That is some alarmist exaggeration right there.
Not surprising since almost every single post in your recent history is some alarmist BS about "blockchain analysis" as if it were something new or earth shattering.
Then again, with a name like "MoneroRacingTeam", I'm not surprised at all, since you obviously have a vested interest in XMR.
Bitcoin privacy is a real thing. Old school methods such as tumbling and OTC trading are tried and true, and newer innovations like Payment Codes and JoinMarket are bringing Bitcoin privacy to the next level.
Why don't you dump your shitty altcoin and start working on a ringsig sidechain?
tl;dr: Stop trying to make XMR happen. It's not going to happen.

I do admit, I thought there were some quotes from Satoshi on network effects, but I can't seem to locate them so maybe I'm mistaken.
However the idea is very widely held, to the point where this is listed directly in the bitcoin wiki:


Not only has bitcoin gained widespread acceptance and general stability, but it has gained many privacy features and privacy enabling complements that bitcoin privacy can easily rival that of any "next Gen private currency"
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:09:56
And you don't consider XMR.to to be an "observable gateway"? Or should I be waiting until everyone in the cryptocurrency world adopts XMR natively?
By your logic, as soon as analysts figure out that people are using XMR to cover their tracks, every TX from every exchanger of BTC/XMR will be blacklisted, causing the exact same issues as blacklisting CJ txs.

Once ASICs are out of the picture, it will cost MUCH MUCH more to attack the network since attackers can't buy ASICs because they haven't been invented yet. GPUs will be enough to protect the network because they will be the fastest option. There will always be more honest miners than attackers so long as the subsidy exists.

All of​ this signalling and guesswork about hashrates is ultimately unimportant. The final decider in any cryptocurrency debate is the opinions of the people holding the coins.
Regardless of any chain splits, bullshit agreements, or posturing on either side, when a change is finally made, it is up to the holders to decide whether they're on board. If they're not, and they sell their coins en masse, Bitcoin is basically over with and there's nothing anyone ​can do about it.

If you think it's all that useful, sharing it _here_ is a waste of time. Share it on the bitcoin dev mailing list, or that of an altcoin that might have less friction? I have no problems with people sharing ideas, but r/bitcoin (and Reddit in general) is not a forum that's known for getting anything accomplished.
It's not a terrible idea IMO, but I don't think bloom filters were a bad idea either. I just prefer to see ideas get implemented rather than get ranted about on Reddit.

When it comes to Bitcoin's tiny tx throughout, 4x is nothing. Meaning even if the example you gave happens exactly, it will only be a short time before LTC is facing the exact same problems.

Obviously, that is true, but you seem to be missing something.






There is a HUGE difference between "encouraging" people, and blatantly lying and misleading people, which is what is necessary for a pump and dump scheme. Just look at your own quotation if you want proof of that. Therefore the market is not moved through "encouragement", rather by duping people out of their MONEY. There it is again, the market being moved by MONEY, not publicity.

An unlimited amount of money doesn't buy you an unlimited amount of rep. Having a nominal amount of money can prove it unlikely that you're a sock, and give you a nominal amount of rep. Having a huge amount of money does not equal a huge amount of rep. It wouldn't take an unreasonably large amount of time for a poor person to get to that nominal level, and any ethical participation in the markets would raise your rep above this nominal level in a short time anyways.

If you think this "hurts poor people unfairly" then you do NOT understand how it works. You can use a single satoshi ($0.00000108) and simply use that identity to build reputation over time. However the other option is to "buy" nominal reputation (basically proof that you're not a sockpuppet) for some higher value that the market would determine. An extreme oversimplification would look something like this 
REP = STAKE * TIME
If time is low, stake must be higher. If stake is low, time must be higher to acheive the same level of reputation.

You may be right, but the question was what would happen if they all only bought 1BTC.
At the current price of $100/BTC, that would inject exactly 1.1 billion dollars into the market, raising the "market cap" from $1,123,226,834 to $2,223,226,834. Divide that by the current number of BTC in circulation, and you get a BTC price of approx. $193.80/BTC.

Okay, that is not only an imperfect measure of users, it's a really terrible one.
A great number of users of bitcoin, (especialy newer users that don't know much about it) aren't going to be running their own bitcoin clients. A ton of them are going to be using various ewallets, and keeping their money on exchanges (especially speculators) Those people's IPs will never touch the bitcoin network until they run their own client.
I never said it was just noise, but that certainly also contributes to the uselessness of such a metric.

Try thinking about it this way. how does one 'adopt' Bitcoins exactly?
First they have to buy some.
What happens when people buy Bitcoins?
The market moves, demand is raised.
And since there is a limited supply, when demand rises, the price rises.
I'm not saying that (adoption == price) exactly, but due to the nature of Bitcoin, one is inextricably pegged to the other.

I'm not saying there is something magical or special about Bitcoin that will make it the one and only. There is, however, a phenomenon called "network effect" that you don't seem to understand.
There are already multiple alternative cryptocurrencies available. They have slight differences, sure, but they are effectively the same technology. Since this is the case, most people will stick with Bitcoin, simply because most people are sticking with Bitcoin.

Considering the way transaction fees work currently, micropayments are becoming more and more infeasable as the price goes up. However, I do believe that isn't really a bad thing, as tiny transactions aren't really suited to being done "on the chain."

You really don't seem to understand how markets and economics work.


No amount of publicity moves the market on its own. The publicity only introduces people to the idea of Bitcoin. The people must then make a decision on their own to buy or not. If people think Bitcoin is a good investment, for whatever reason, they will buy. Its not the publicity that magically forces people to buy. People become informed, and then proceed to make investments.

There is a huge difference between outlawing and "killing".
Even if Bitcoin never becomes a global ubiquitous currency, it will still continue to exist.
Even if the "average customer" and "investor" drop Bitcoin, there will always be other groups, however small or marginalized, that will continue to support it.
They can take away most of the investment, they can make the price drop, even precipitously, but they can never "kill" Bitcoin.

It would be a terrible idea to use real money (Bitcoin) for this, it would all get taken out of the game economy as quickly as possible. I would say you should make an alt chain, but securing it against double spends without any incentive structure would be realistically impossible. One way to go would be to use a solution like Open Transactions. You can issue and process an in game currency relatively easily with OT, and even set up a mechanism to trade the game currency for real money, ala WoW gold. However, since OT is not yet complete, I would advocate using a generic db setup like other games

You seem like the type to disagree with math.
FWIW, "gambling" consists of many different varieties of games, each with it's own rules, and it's own odds. Card games, like poker for example, often have a very complicated set of rules; and often better odds, if you have sufficient KNOWLEDGE and understanding of the aforementioned rules, and SKILL in interacting with other players. Better odds than, say, the lottery, which is also a form of gambling, but is a game with much simpler rules, requires zero skill, and has incredibly terrible odds of winning. SatoshiDICE is also a good example of a simple game with shitty odds.
You can't just lump all of gambling in together, and then talk about odds of winning. That makes no sense.

Nothing. I never claimed that it wasn't possible. In fact, that was my argument from the beginning, that an alt could gain adoption, but only with "REALLY good reason"


It would be very easy to trade between these two currencies. If you wait to adopt the new currency until after most of your purchasing power is wiped out, that is nobody's fault but yours. Any decent investor know to do research, keep up to date on current events, a most of all DIVERSIFIED.

Even WITH MtGox and a few dozen other centralized exchanges, you STILL can't transfer ANY amount of money using Bitcoin. Even if you possess 100% of all the bitcoins that exist, you can still only transfer around 1.15 billion dollars worth.
Allow me to be crystal clear here. You have now officially abandoned your original argument, and seem to just be agreeing with everything I've said about liquidity, while still keeping up your argumentative tone, for some reason.
My point from the very begining was this: For as long as Bitcoin exists, there will ALWAYS be SOME level of liquidity. Whether that level is "useful" or "meaningful" to you, is completely irrelevant.
You can put down P2P exchange methods all you want, but whether or not you think something is "vaporware" is also irrelevant. I'm not sure what rainbow you're talking about, but I forsee Open Transactions based markets and digital cash becoming extremely important in the near future, regardless of cooperation from traditional banks.
I'm not saying that bank integration is a bad thing, it helps Bitcoin in many obvious ways. My point is that it is not absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to survive.

When somebody decides to start using (adopt) bitcoin, rather than another currency, they do so for some specific reason, even if the only reason is their employer uses it to pay them. Whether they realize it or not, they are thereby investing their savings into bitcoin. When it comes to financial products adoption = investment.

I do think having a smartcard and/or magstripe card that would interface directly with current POS systems would be nice during the transition period.
I don't necessarily think it should be everyone's priority, but I hope it will be someone's.

Please cite some undeniable proof that Wagner had anything at all to do with it before shaming people.

Casinos profit from gambling and enable/exploit people with gambling addiction? 
No shit, Sherlock.

You're not making any sense anymore.

This is probably one of the most interesting posts I've seen on this sub since it opened.

You never fail to increase your level of asshattery with every post.
The idea that the so-called "energy" of my posts shows that I don't understand the wokrings of our world is, frankly, completely laughable.
I have not made any assumptions about you. I do not claim to know anything at all about you; though I have inferred a few things from your previous posts.
The fact that you have come to the conclusion, based on our extremely limited exchange here, that I "lack the ability to see the subtleties of **any given situation**" is hilariously ironic. I don't expect you to understand.
The fact that I am an American is completely irrelevant, and making that sort of sweeping generality appears to be nothing more than an attempt to draw attention away from your own shortcomings.
At this point, our conversation has degraded to the point of frivloty, therefore I am choosing to end it. Thank you for your time.

You must be in the wrong place sir. I believe your posts belong in

which means its great for creditors, which means vastly lower interest rates.
These things often find a way of balancing themselves out in a truly free market.

I don't think it's meant to be used for HFT. It probably will be slow at first, but it will get better with time. The important thing is that we have a p2p exchange mechanism on some level.

A single, or handful of miners deciding to ignore certain transactions won't make any difference, those transactions will still go through because other miner will accept them.
In fact, Luke-jr, who runs the Eligius mining pool has been ignoring SatoshiDICE transactions for some time. They still go through, and at a ridiculous level.

I'm not defending anyone. I don't like Bruce any more than you do.
But lobbing accusations at people with no proof to support them is very much not cool, no matter who the person is.

I've been realizing it since shortly after it went up on github back in October 2011. Gotta be patient though. Its pretty massive in terms of raw power and functionality. That and it's being coded in spare time by 1 or 2 guys. I'm happy to see it up on again, the more people aware of OT makes for more potential contributors. I only wish I had the coding chops to participate.

You keep asking us to disprove you, we can't. For the same reason that you can never prove yourself correct.
There is NO POSSIBLE WAY to prove or disprove who Satoshi is.
Even if Micheal Reiter himself published a document claiming to be Satoshi, EVEN if he signed it with Satoshi's PGP key, it would STILL not be proof positive that he was the real deal. It would be easy for Satoshi to give his key up to someone else. (Not saying this is likely, but still possible)
