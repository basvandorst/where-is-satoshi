I disagree, a truly good "leader" should have the ultimate goal of uplifting those around him to a level where he renders himself irrelevant

Holy. fucking. shit.

the last fucking thing we need is more people that are "destined to lead" or "true leaders"
what we need are good people that elevate their fellow man and woman, not more fucking kings.
the age of leaders is coming to an end bruv, the old ways are dying a slow, painful, and well-earned death, and we will all be better off in the long run

The real question here is *why is time advertising for silk road 2.0?*

I dunno man, ive seen this argument a lot and I dont buy it.
Wasnt the biggest bump for BTC shortly after the whole Cyprus debakel?
Hell I could make a case that YOU are in fact the arrogant one because you assume that the large majority of humans are a bunch of authoritarian, bootlicking lapdogs that want to appease the powers that be and run in fear from confontation.
I would say the average human, living in the real world, doing menial labor actually gets a weee bit excited at discord, whatever form it may take. People know they are getting fucked. It takes a lot of luck in life to not come to that realization.
This is the philosophy behind property destruction f.e.
you are not smashing a bank window because the act itself is somehow effective; it isnt.
you smash the window of the bank so that all the customers the next day see what you have done, they see that not everyone is exactly happy about said bank, and lets be honest they probably smirk to themselves...
Propaganda of the deed. destroying the illusion of democracy and fair play.
Imo this is far more effective than begging your massa for change, any concessions you will get from the powers that be are nothing but a stalling tactic or an attempt to appease.
You are implying that we should dumb down what bitcoin is because otherwise the "masses" will never be able to comprehend just how many possibilities it opens up(unlike you of course)
I dont fuckin buy it man, people are smarter than you give them credit.
One of my main BTC guys is a fuckin truck driver, he only went to school till he was 15. this motherfucker knows more about GNU/linux, crypto, fuckin CB radios and all kinds of other shit than any of the IT students I have ever met.
Do not underestimate peoples capability to autodidact.
the tools are there to learn pretty much anything you fuckin want, give people the chance to execute and they will.
every single one of us has an instinct for rebellion, its part of our maturing process and paramount to our survival. 
Your attempt at aiming for the lowest common denominator seems supremely arrogant to me, far more arrogant than this little video.

To anyone(like me) worried about depositing cold hard crypto to help these cats test, you can run the Darkwallet on testnet, which is a clone of the bitcoin network for testing purposes.
this is one of the few projects where I dont have worries about the people involved, and im a seriously paranoid schiz.
I have a feeling the darkwallet will become extremely important in the days to come
