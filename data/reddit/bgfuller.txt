Trezor uses bitcore backend server, or rather Insight, as a block chain source. So it's likely not affected.

I haven't seen any. However I've noticed increasing support for BitID (for WordPress and Wikis) which is more or less very similar and could be compatible.

There is an open PR to add segwit serialization support to bitcore-lib that is backwards compatible, and understands both formats. See:

`libconsensus` makes a few script validation methods available, as can be viewed at: 
The bindings link from above at:  expose a few other methods directly to Node.js. A full list of what these methods are can be found at: 
A few of the methods available:
- `getBlock` - gives a Node.js buffer of the block
- `getTransaction` - gives a Node.js buffer of the transaction
- `start`
- `stop`
As well as some events that are emitted using an `EventEmitter`:
- `tip` when a new block is connected to the chain
- `tx` when a new transaction enters the mempool

The patch to Bitcoin Core 0.11.1 is available at:

The C++ bindings can run in separate threads in the same way that file system disk reads are handled in Node.js.

It's running bitcoind in the same process, so there isn't a need to run bitcoind separately. Bitcoin Core 0.11.1 (bitcoind) is the current version that is compiled, and now Insight communicates directly via the Node.js bindings, which is much faster.
