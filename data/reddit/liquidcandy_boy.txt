Nobody said we are having trouble in that department. I think that attitude is unhealthy to the future of Bitcoin and should be polarized slightly. We should look at attract more users and not think, "Well, we have enough for now." or "We seem to be doing fine." 
The non-user market is the largest, therefore most potential of streaming Bitcoin lies in converting those non-user (which also represent non-human such as business/corporations that may use Bitcoin services) into users. So, maximum users should be of concern, not "we don't have any trouble in that department." 
You do realize you're shooting yourself and everyone else in the foot with that statement right? 
Refer to it as money with the lay folks. That's my strategy.

The way you have packaged it is not a generally accepted definition of money, and is far from it.
Bitcoin serves the same purpose as other forms of money have in light of human history. Ether for instance brings with it new auxiliary features, e.g. smart contracts, but is fundamentally money still. 
Anyway, to attract more users, I think it is better we call it money for now.

Better yet, call it money when an entire nation adopts it
Oh, wait.
[An entire nation is on the cusp of adopting it](
And Russia has already adopted Ether for low-level adminstrative function.
Where have you been?
