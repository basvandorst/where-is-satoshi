WOW, you deserve a massive reward for your honesty and integrity. Amazing brother man!
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:49:59
Coinbase has become a stain on the industry.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:44
Broken through 18K on the thumb! Woo!
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:41:02
Maybe Saint Nick delivers early with 15K BTC on the 25th! That would be wonderful
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:32:44
Hell yeah...going to be very interesting, popcorn at the ready! I've been using this link to estimate trading volume (you can also sort by currency but when you do, it has a large percentage in USD, possibly this includes Tether?)  
Lots of other options to sift through data on Bitcoinity, have a look.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:58:04
The definition? 20K to $900 is a crash, and burn.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:36
The valuation is something nobody can peg. There's never been something like this before, nobody knows what it's worth. What you're seeing is the market determining the price. Price discovery. What it's worth is still unknown, although, it's definitely higher than 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:42:41
Looks like strong support above 15K, very nice. Can't wait to see what happens next, rise or dump!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:45:57
Congratulations and welcome to the Bitcoin sub. Remember to hold forever and always buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:28
Holy shit, what happened!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:57
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:28
Broke 16,050 in Bithumb (Korea) exchange! This is still running higher ATM...
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:28:51
No reason to prove anything to you or anyone else reading the comments, if they base investment advice on what someone from a message board says, they deserve to learn hard lessons.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:00
Once it permeates your dreams, it's over.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:58:58
Give Electrum a look. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:03
2018 will be the year of decentralized exchanges coming online, and everyone will eventually dump these unscrupulous businesses. Coinbase will fall quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:20:55
Just your early bird pump! Waking the East coast up in a stiff cold...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:38
Agreed, a correction is always healthy and due. Even down to 7 or 6K from here wouldn't even be that terrible, it was just hitting lows a few weeks ago in the 5.2-6k area!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:48
20k down to 15k is my best estimate
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:07:52
Down to around 1140 as of a few seconds ago. This game will most likely continue until Sunday or Monday. What do you guys think?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:04:41
Each day seems like the craziest day in crypto history this past month or so.

Watching it go on Bithumb now, this is awesome to see it cross 20K!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:27:02
You raise some great points grouper13, also I'd like to add, there's been a MASS influx of regular joe's and jane's this past few weeks, especially since Turkey day. December could be a rally for the ages! Mind your wits folks, don't get too drunk on euphoria.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:56:59
Looks like a modest choice, but great reward for your persistence. Many more to come, cheers!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:47:07
Soon as I buy that first coin, I plan on declaring any and all capital gains made from the investment. Pay your taxes and be clear minded.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:58:23
This is getting scary
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:56
It's happening, perhaps before we turn into Dec. 7th!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:13
The absolute state of nocoiners...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:12:57
So who is playing guess the top? It's got to drop at least for a few minutes, like every other high, right guys?

Did you guys know you can send BTC out from your Coinbase with 0 transaction fees? Use GDAX to withdraw and the fee is ZERO! Simply log in to GDAX.com with your Coinbase credentials, click deposit button to move your BTC from Coinbase and, once it's in your GDAX wallet, do a withdraw to BTC address, and done. Coinbase covers the fee, but you get charged nothing and receive all the BTC you withdrew.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:58
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:03
You'll be in the black shortly, we all know BTC is headed for interstellar travels.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:48:31
Thanks, noticed it directly after.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:24
The Bithumb exchange has been locking up a few times today, either that, or the API is just overloaded. Too much traffic most likely!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:43:41
Morning, welcome to the safe alternative to crack!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:58
Adoption by whom? Seems there's more and more adoption by users happening, hence the price rise. You're deluded buddy. Businesses will use LTC or ETH or another coin if they want fast, cheap transactions. Bitcoin is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:33:54
This real? Wow that's a shitload of cash. Binance is doing the same thing to people lately. Be very careful with these exchanges folks!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:35
Still going lads! 13118...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:38
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:25
Nope, start with $50 or $100 and you'll be in the game and ready to learn, don't make excuses just sign up for a Coinbase and go for it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:18
Watching as well, it has insane buy support, breaking every barrier. Unreal!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:24
This is an ignorant comment. Nocoiner detected...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:05
And she keeps climbing, truly awesome fellas and ladies!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:20:07
This is plausible
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:53
Anyone been paying attention to Bithumb and Bitflyer prices too? Over 14,100 on Korea's, and Japan over 13k now!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:30
We are now above $14,325 USD in GDAX, and almost $18K in Korea! WOW.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:53
Scary, indeed. This is going to be an interesting week or two upcoming...
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:05:53
Now 14's! Sweet! How's those TIFFs goin' boomer?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:37
It won't hit $10K on tuesday, but which price did you sell at this weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:32
Deutsche Bank, the one who services the Trumps, and the one that indeed need a bailout. Pffft.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:03:37
edit* broke 18K USD on Bithumb, and nearly 17K on bitFlyer as well! Amazing stuff!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:30:13
Which high will break today folks? Good morning Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:08:06
Unreal isn't it!? This past day and week is just blurring together, numbers in your dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:54
Maybe the fraud dept. was doing their job, always give them a call for large tx's and make sure they pre-screen a confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:17:44
Last time I checked, businesses accepting BTC has little to do with the skyrocketing price. Or future stable price. User adoption, buying, holding, and maybe using once or twice is adoption that's only going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:00:20
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:42
It will certainly happen, a reward for you iron-hand hodlers.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:42:17
Maybe spend 1/5 of your budget now, then wait until later to see where the price is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:06:52
He probably meant that sudden price drops shouldn't scare you into selling, it eventually recovers, often within hours.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:03
Do animal or environmental charities count? WWF, save the whales, and save the rainforests please! You're a stand-up lad.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:16
DO. NOT. SELL. Give it 2 years minimum before considering saleing your bit coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:34
Happens every time. Bitcoin the king controls all markets, most of the time. Best to hedge your risk in BTC if you're unsure. Alts and other coins always swing up and down with more velocity.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:53
Source on your unconfirmed transactions? Seems like it's half that number you spouted.

I wouldn't advise you to load private keys on any internet connected device, until you're actually broadcasting a tx. Maybe look up a watch address?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:04
Good strategy, I'll be surprised if it holds for long above 15K

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:19
It's okay to admit you don't understand the technology and resort to parroting something you read in Forbes. It would be better for you than remaining angry you missed out on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-06 02:36:01
It usually blows through ATH, then settles down below it for a few days-week, before reaching a new high. Lately anyway...who knows! Remember these great times 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:59:26
Good clip, Andreas is very intelligent.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:48:57
What kind of account did you wire from? Standard bank checking/savings should have come through no problem, however I've noted folks having issues wiring from a financial institution (IRA, stock market account, etc.) I think you should call Coinbase when their customer support opens, this usually gets a quicker reply than e-mail.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:29
It's HAPPENING gentlemen!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:34
That's the million bitcoin question...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:00:30
Another historic day, we're now at $15,600 and going higher!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:26:13
Beginning to think we'll never see $5,900 again. Should I have my friends cancel their limit buys? To the Mars!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:31:57
14,500 nearly in Korea now...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:18
Great points blue!
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:58
Futures is anyones guess, for a new game the rules will be created as it develops over coming months. CBOE is the options king, while CME specializes in futures. 1 BTC vs. 5 BTC contract sizes will attract all sorts of investors. Interesting times ahead, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:29
LOL. Salty as hell you are, snippings.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:22:35
We all learn this lesson once or twice, don't sweat it too hard, focus on the future potential!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:16:34
Stop talking about it to them, you've tried your best. Besides, what if you talk them into buying and then they begin to lose money? You will become the pariah. Best to keep going and stick to your plan.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:49:59
Sell 20% of your portfolio at 1 million
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:59:42
Hit that ranch, bro.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:07
Get those 20k memes ready people, how high we go, who knows!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:08:04
Of course, it's like clockwork, shills out of the woodwork (Chinese and Russian wood LOL)
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:07
The banksters and stock folks are shook to the core. Seems like they're fighting to scream fraud as loud as possible today, bullish!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:31:49
Someone REALLY wants to keep the price below 18,000. Even more so below 18,500. After their 17,250 wall was destroyed, this seems like the new target. Matches below the futures contract for January. Hmm.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:17:45
Give it a try for a small buy to test the waters. Sleep time!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:23
Go back to the donald
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:45:32
Nice one buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:49:13
Excellent score!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:59:04
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:36
Folks, it's broken $16,000 USD on Korea's Bithumb! Congrats again everyone, seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:33:31
I'd advise against selling ATM.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:55
$16,540 and approaching new ATH's! This is just mind-blowing...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:17
It's scary playing the dip at these levels. Good luck to those who do.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:23
Sorry bears! LOL GO BABY GO!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:50:18
It will be worth 20K very very soon
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:45
This seems logical, great point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:38
ETH, LTC, BCH, will be more currency than Bitcoin. Most folks store Bitcoin for long term, and those that don't eventually will
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:12:32
Which OS are you running? You mentioned PC so I presume Windows or Linux? You can check your local&gt;roaming&gt;browser folder/java or similar folder structure to start. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:33

For U.S.A. residents, you can use Coinbase, although I'm reluctant to recommend them, the alternatives are Gemini or bitFlyer (maybe Kraken as well)
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:10:49
English is also not my first language, but thank you anyway, for the poignant spelling lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:06
There are manipulators for sure, to what extent is unknown. Even they will be in for surprises.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:58
It's not a currency though, this is misinformation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:53:08
There's thousands of stories like this, myself included. Anytime this year guarantees you're still an early adopter, keep your focus on the goal of obtaining some BTC, and good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:07:03
Ok, I was looking at the mempool page, which looks like it's normal to me for the past couple of weeks, same old story. All will be fine once the evil entities cease their spamming of small sized tx's. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:22:03
Don't forget about the endangered animals, especially whales (even the ocean,) rhino, elephant, and tiger. Either way thanks for your generosity, happy holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:29
Sounds like you missed the boat? It's never too late brother.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:09:31
When we did hit 17250, I noticed the wall moved up towards 18300 mark for a few minutes, then it returned lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:42:14
Fallacy. There is no ban, only restrictions for teens, and some sort of tax on profit. Maybe a few banks are dropping exchanges for now--probably nothing too serious, a little Tether can fix! Ha ha.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:28:02
Thanks for your efforts and time mods, and congrats on the milestones!!! Here's to an exciting 2018 and cheers to Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:35
You're correct--a mix of both retail and institutional money flooding in, exponential user growth, mania...whenever will it end? Sunday begins the first bell rings at CBOE...
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:41:42
The plans are going live on Sunday at 5 p.m. EST. There have also been unregulated margin and futures markets for years, and it's always fun to watch shorts get liquidated! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:04:16
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:01:07
The mining fee should decrease within the next few days or so, if you can hold out moving it, just wait 'til it's lower.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:10:18
thanks just shorted blockfolio
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:13:56
Beware of Bitfinex. You can cancel your withdraw and it should appear in your account instantly after, then initiate a new withdrawal, possibly going through faster than your processing request. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:55
What do you think? Swings between the difficulty adjustments?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:03:02
Coinbase is being run into the ground by the CEO, hopefully they can transition him out soon. A company slowly suffocating in this fast-paced new world!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:48
Now it's breaches $16,625 in Korea! This continues to amaze...enjoy the show, remain calm...
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:18:19
Agreed. Looks like Asia is waking up a bit early this Sunday...
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:44:45
Is everyone ready for new highs this week? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:49:43
There's always an issue with Kraken it seems. Hope you get it resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:16:56
cryptowat.ch has alerts but I believe only allows 1 unless you subscribe, it's a nice site though. Check tradingview.com or coinigy. Also you can create your own excel or google spreadsheet and have a custom update that pulls price data and gives you figures.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:22:45
15K is neigh...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:17:05
Maybe whales, banks, private investors, etc. are preparing for the futures markets, is one theory.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:08
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:13:50
Yes, one thing I've noticed for sure, the ALTs always bleed down after hitting new highs (or just normally trading) when BTC breaks upwards, they fall like an avalanche! Rolling into the abominable King Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:24
No, it will fall 20-40% sometime in the next few weeks, undoubtedly. As for going away, that would be quite a slim chance at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:22:20
POGS bro.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:00:36
Looks solid enough, you're taking a nice gamble with IOTA.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:54
Always good to be aware of potential threats, the "bubble" will break but it's anyones guess as to when and how severe it affects recovery. To be continued...
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:49:40
The market cap of BTC is much lower than most companies in the stock market. You are reading too much delusional text.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:44:24
would 20k by dinner surprise anyone after this run!? maybe a small bit...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:09:39
I never bought my own bitcoin, but many friends have some. Wish I wouldv'e bought in every month since 2013. It's not too late though, according to many, so this week I will try Coinbase for my first BTC and/or ETH purchase. Can't wait to join you all!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:30:38
Perhaps the fear of insane levels of inflation is driving the Koreans to dump like no other into BTC and other cryptos...also, possible regulations causing more FOMO before they're restricted? A correction at this point wouldn't even be so bad, from 15K to 7.5k, is 50% and would probably recover within a few hours.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:53
I think it's back up! edit* nevermind, seems down again.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:12:28
I believe they're implementing a 20% maximum move per day, no matter what. Not sure if that was considered, I'm still learning myself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:52
Absolute insanity! Wow. Wow. Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:43
There is not. You must sell for USD then move to the LTC market and make a buy.

There's no certain way to know this, but you can take a few tips in mind: Search for when the most volume occurs, and one time I've noticed is 11 a.m. UTC seems to have large volumes. Also keep an eye around 11 p.m. UTC as well! Good luck!

HODL, more than you know, this is the best strategy for 99% of us.

13090 now! Haha WOW!

It's your wife bud, you should probably tell her. She is entitled to half of everything you own? Good luck! Otherwise, you seem to have a stable thought process about how to react to this wonderful investment growth.
Make sure you keep most of it riding on the market!

This is very unfortunate, and serves to remind us all to play cautiously in this space-still many, many scammers, snakes, and rats. Thankfully you've received a refund!

This is an historic moment for humanity!

Complete fear mongering by trolls/wrekt former bitcoin holder, or both.

This guy breeds.

When it goes to 10k, the most you can expect to drop is around 7.5K but in these times of weekly good news developments, you should probably buy as much as you can afford asap.

If there is evidence of manipulation, countries that take it seriously and are more regulated, like Japan and S. Korea, will investigate further and fine/etc. those responsible.

Downvote these obvious trolls, or seriously psychologically insane tether-foil hat folks. The spam is ridiculous, nobody wants the subs spammed with this garbage conspiracy theory. 
Use some logical critical thinking, and ask yourself how likely it is the entire ecosystem using Tether, including exchanges and customers alike, are the bad guys here, and these 2 or 3 wrekt traders spouting nonsense are correctly presenting facts. LOL. Please downvote and report all the tether FUD posts!

The CME group futures fund eventually going live will add another bump up to king BTC soon! Should be approved and trading by early 2018, or even earliest as next month. Great news!

Not every exchange/service is setup for segwit addresses yet, might want to stick with standard for now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:20:32
Good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:00:01
Thanks, I'm doing the same! The troll in this thread is already blocked on my feed. This spam is getting ridiculous, keep the downvotes handy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:46
NASDAQ futures announced today, for launch early 2018. Maybe another little bump.

It's always amusing watching the mainstream finance folk try to compare Bitcoin to anything they understand, but very few actually know what's up. Brian Kelly is usually well informed. 
The worst is when all the hot shot CEOs parrot the same thing: I believe in blockchain but not so sure about this "Bitcoin" thing. LOL, yeah, instant loss of credibility please stop talking now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:04:38
Ignore it, then downvote and report the spammer for spreading bullshit conspiracy theories 24/7. It's just a noob that got wrekt, or some shills. Either way it's not worth wasting your time trying to comprehend a crazy persons hallucinations.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:15:49
Also hit 7985 on GDAX, tether conspiracy theorists are either paid shills, dumber than average, or both
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:56:33
Wow, that exchange has an incredible amount of volume! I wonder how many users will flock over to it on this news alone?
