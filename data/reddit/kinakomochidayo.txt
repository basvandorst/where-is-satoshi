Clean MDMA shouldn't have the hangover. As far as I know, MAPS uses pharmaceutical grade 99.66% purity MDMA.

It can be from around $1250~$2500 depending on the retreat, usually 6-10 days, 4-6 ceremonies. A western medical doctor, [Joe Tafur]( sometimes take groups to a retreat in Peru but yeah I don't know anywhere else with medical staff.

You could look into Ayahuasca as an alternative to MDMA; it's legal to do in South America. You have to be off your meds for at least a month though.

I'm not saying that depersonalization/derealization doesn't happen. It's happened to me in the past for 8 months but I never blamed the LSD for it. I'm actually grateful it happened because the things I saw which led to the difficult trip that caused the DPDR, revealed the traumas I haven't dealt with in my past and my addictions. I started meditating and exercising regularly.
It's easier to blame a drug, than face whatever it is that caused it (including taking responsibility for the dosage and set &amp; setting), and integrate the lessons into life.
If there was a psychotherapist there to help me process what I was going through, I probably wouldn't have experienced depersonalization.

THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:13:43
I'd trust Satoshi's words any day over power tripping, drama loving devs/companies.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:24:07
Have you looked into Ayahuasca?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:16:53
MDMA with psychotherapy might help. There is also Ayahuasca, which can be done in South America.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:55:37
Did you test and make sure you had clean MDMA? Did you only take about 125mg? Did you do it with good set and setting?
These are researchers using clean MDMA as a tool in psychotherapy setting, not at a rave or with other random people, so it's most likely very different from what you did.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:12:07
The only other excuse they can have is that they're tired of the drama and how entitled a lot of people in the community are.

PTSD is not just war, it's seeing death in accidents, physical, emotional, sexual assault, and more.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:05:18
Yeah. Or have the developers implement the 2x until LN is fine.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:23:07
Why would a person rely on medical cannabis over a long period of time, when a person can do 3 sessions of MDMA and wipe out the PTSD permanently?
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:14:36
You'll get used to it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:41:55
I'm personally for Ayahuasca when it comes to PTSD and other various traumas. I haven't had enough personal experiences with shrooms to say one way or another, and I've never done MDMA (just that the data is saying that 3 sessions is good for PTSD, but not sure about developmental PTSD) None of these solutions are permanent because it mostly comes down to the integration afterwards.

Lmao, this whole thread sounds like something out of Fox News.
"These folks r wagin war on Bitcoin! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!"
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:31:53
You could try Ayahuasca in Peru with a reputable and safe shaman.. just have to be off your meds a month prior to doing it though.

It's called advancement of technology, and net neutrality.
Increasing disk space, increasing bandwidth speed, lower costs.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:51:03
No, not a problem at all!! This is good for Bitcoin. LN coming soon-ish™

More like RIP OP, that amount of sodium could literally be lethal.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:09
Which is kind of ridiculous, because it worked fine as is; a blocksize change would've been a lot simpler to implement, and less error prone, at least until LN was integrated fully. Basic KISS - keep it simple stupid

So by that logic, USDT is fucked too. woah.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:30:25
Most likely yes. I'm thinking around $2000.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:31:37
Yeah, probably. It's going to take months though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:32:44
Or I'll avoid gambling, and put money where my mouth is by continuing to save fiat for the eventual bottom like a normal person :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:44
It's going to take months for the correction to end, just like how it took months to get to here. I feel bad for all the newbies buying right now.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:15:12
MUH REGULATIOOOOOON!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:34:50
Go back into the history of prices with Bitcoin. You'll see about 4 major corrections that go down at least 80%.

Honeybadger doesn't care about what some CEO says.
Oh wait, honeybadger was taken over by a parasite.

It doesn’t help that many posters with reasonable content got banned over the span of few years around Segwit.

Pretty sure they'll just implement Gavin's scaling solution if it's been thoroughly tested

Woah woah woah, a reply criticising BTC at the top? How the shit did this happen?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:53:04
Or you know, why don't they just call them what they are instead of being biased, and let the market decide?
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:55:34
You'd realize both subreddits are toxic if you took some time away from this one.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:12:13
To be honest, both BTC and BCH subreddits creep me out.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:57:11
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:02:42
You haven't trusted them since they added Bitcoin Cash. I'm pretty sure they had way more bigger problems than that like customer service
