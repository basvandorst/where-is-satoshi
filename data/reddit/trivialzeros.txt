The distribution of bitcoin holdings is already massively skewed.

Some interesting questions. Did the gold supply ever really reach a steady (or decreasing) supply state like bitcoin will, though? I don't think any currency in the world has such a precedent.

Poor people have the same access to stocks and bonds as rich people right now, if they desired that route. That is to say, if they had spare cash to invest. The problem is that poor people do not have investment capital. A vast majority of poor people outspend their income and cannot hold any type of investment - stocks, bonds, or cash. 


Not sure why you would assume this. Bitcoin deflation rates would be also be driven by population growth, lost coins, and currency holding. 


There's already peer to peer lending, if you want a market lending economy. 


The rich don't hold currency only because they are better off investing in market growth currently. If currency was a good investment the rich would instantly switch to holding currency. 


Inflation doesn't hurt consumers because prices go up, it hurts consumers because wages go down relative to prices if wages aren't inflation adjusted (which they rarely are). I don't think wages will ever be constant and tied to a deflationary currency, but we seem to disagree there.

Deflation makes it so the bank loses incentive to provide loans at all. Why would they give you a loan if they can hold the currency and it gains value? Loans present massive risks to banks already, because not all loans are repaid in full. Although I do see now that the interest rate wouldn't be driven by the deflation rates, just by risks and the need to make money.
