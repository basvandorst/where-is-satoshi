How can you prove they are Coinbase cold storage addresses?

TXID or address? Let's see what happened.

Is this your entire transaction history? 
Because it looks like you're spending the bitcoin that are being sent to your addresses. 
For example:
Address 1KS1RVMNZH75TaNsPonXKYXCkB816zGNcT receives 0.01554 in txid 5700c0bc2f38197d20a9f67cd6569d33324423564a9a85c88a5b32c561c23ef6 and then spends 0.01554 shortly after in txid 0b9889e7e3067ac839e233da271f122eb613f3933ddc9197a7e6b289a1e7dbeb
Or you're just monitoring addresses with that application. 
Unrelated. 
As a darknet markets user I would not recommend you show anyone your addresses. From 1KS1's activity we can see that there are a few other addresses you control. Here are a few:

I doubt it. This looks like a sweep transaction. Probably a Merchant wallet provider such as Coinbase or Bitpay sweeping all the wallet addresses for services that use their wallets into one address.

136d7c862267204c13fec539a89c7b9b44a92538567e1ebbce7fc9dd04c5a7f0 Seems to be sending 400BTC to a mixer. Then the mixer splits the bitcoin in multiple sequential transactions 926aa23c7ed5c756e5d1ea1cac12d898c4a9dfdd79cbd561ad0a22e7e0e55396
... After 21 transactions the reminder of the bitcoin seem to lead to a final mixing transaction d06990df5e981dead3ae190e79a6ca0e4afedf4e23e07c2a3344d7a3acc29de5
At this point it's impossible to tell if the bitcoins within that transaction are yours. 
Many of the mixing transactions send to 15PRz8Px5PdbvgyXcepyL9cPZdX2VtcZKh which seems strange. 
You should get some of the bitcoin investigation companies to help you.
