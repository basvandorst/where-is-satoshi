The WAVE algorithm is looking to take advantage of long-term trends which play out over the course of several weeks or even months. Given the timescale and goals of the algorithm, the move last night would be considered "noise" because the longer-term uptrend is still intact. 
In terms of the purchase price of your BTC, we have no way of knowing what your cost basis is, but we do value your BTC at the current price when those funds are deposited so that our fee calculations are correct. The trade decisions made by the algorithm are not impacted by the valuation give to your BTC when deposited. The algorithm is basically deciding if it is better, at this moment, to hold BTC or USD and then positioning user accounts according to that decision.

Thanks for taking the time to look at our website and trading results. The data needed updated and this has been done. You will see another trade that occurred on 5/13. As per our website at the top of our live trading results section, "This strategy is designed to increase the user's bitcoin account size by following the dominant market trend. If you are long-term optimistic about Bitcoin but want to mitigate downside risk and increase your bitcoin holdings, this algorithm is for you." We have added an additional row of data in our analysis section with the USD returns so that there should be no confusion for anyone moving forward.
Since November, we are up 59% in our BTC holdings. We are down about 4.7% in USD terms. However, please remember, if you were a buy-and-hold bitcoin investor in November, you are down about 40% in USD today and you have the same number of bitcoins you started with. Our strategy has outperformed buy-and-hold by a significant margin.

The peak of the last Bitcoin hype cycle looks like it happened in December, 2013. We will know in a few years.

This is simple. Just go to  and click on the Mac OSX link below "Download Bitcoin XT 0.11A" at the top of the page. No need to make a video. Instead of tipping me for the help, I'd love to gain a new user for my Bitcoin startup:  Take a look and let me know if you need some help setting up an account.

Is it really impossible to boot new ETH nodes? My understanding is that it can take several days to sync but saying it is impossible is hyperbolic. Happy to see articles/evidence to the contrary. 
Either way, I do like the idea of the overweight character. That could make for a good episode plot arc.. "Ethereum Eats It All..." or something like that.
