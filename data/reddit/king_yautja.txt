I don't plan on cashing out to fiat. I plan on spending my bitcoins directly for goods and services so I won't "cash out" in the conventional sense. In order to consider parting with them at all 1 coin would have to be worth about as much as a 4 bedroom suburban 2 story house. Until then, I shall HODL.

8 years ago bitcoin was worth a few pennies if it was even that much. Today it's over $10,000. That's a hell of an upward trend. I don't bat an eyelid at an 80% swing in either direction any more.

I think Hal Finney was Satoshi, and he sadly died of ALS in 2014. It makes sense if you think about it not only did he have the perfect skill set he also knew he was on borrowed time which is why he went from whitepaper to Genesis block mined in 2 months. He was the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction, did Satoshi send it to himself? The whitepaper was clearly written by an American. "Satoshi" stopped contributing to the project in 2010, due to his deteriorating health?
Its all circumstantial but we have an individual with the right nationality (English fluency etc), the perfect skill set, someone who knew they did not have much time, and who died before bitcoin really entered the mainstream consciousness.

Best thing to do is cost average. Just make regular purchases say once per month and don't pay attention to how much btc it buys. If it goes up, great. If it goes down, well you get more btc for your buck.

If anything this is a vindication of bitcoin. If this is the worst crash since 2013, it means bitcoin has been here and done that. We've been through crashes like this before and bitcoin is still chugging along, and even post crash it's still 15x what it was at the 2013 peak.

Segwit is a block size increase that's what a lot of people don't realise. It's basically an increase to 4MB blocks but done in such a way that it's a soft fork. Just now I cannot name any wallets that support segwit transactions but that will change just give it time.

You said yourself it's value will stabilise in time. This is the bootstrapping phase of bitcoin. In order to become a serious global currency it has to grow a hell of a lot. I'd say at least another 2 orders of magnitude. Bitcoin is not a currency yet but it's function will change as it grows.

I own my own house and keep a small (few grand) slush fund for unexpected short term expenses like a big car or home repair. Since I have a roof over my head and my basic needs met beyond that it all goes into bitcoin.

Too far in the other direction. At current prices a can of soda would cost something like 30,000 satoshis.
I think we should look for a unit that puts most every day purchases somewhere between 1 and 200, with figures in the tens or hundreds of thousands usually meaning cars or houses.
@_date: 2019-03-26 15:52:45
I think something like the above could enter into the common law. For example here in the UK in property law if you build over a piece of land you do not own but your claim goes unchallenged for 24 years you can apply for full legal ownership.
I think something similar could happen with bitcoin if the encryption standard of that address has gone since gone out of date and the coins haven't moved in 24 years they could reasonably and legally be considered "abandoned", and anyone who was able to brute force it could legally claim them as salvage.
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:42:50
I think there's some truth to that. It also makes bitcoin unwieldy. I don't want to pay 0.0002373 BTC for a lunch. It's time we start using a smaller unit as the defacto standard. Like a millionth of a bitcoin. That unit would be divisible to 2 decimal places (satoshis) and that mirrors the dollar/cents or pounds/pence system used by most nations so it's already quite familiar.
At current prices, 1/1 millionth of a bitcoin is about half of a US cent. So you could get 20,000 of them for a hundred bucks. That's probably more appealing than 0.002 BTC.

The blockchain is a method of maintaining a decentralised ledger amongst participants who do not know or trust each other. 
Let's say Alice and Bob want to transact, but they don't trust each other, so they use Charlie whom they both trust to maintain a ledger of their transaction history. 
This creates the problem of a *trusted third party*. Charlie has total control over the only ledger, this gives him a lot of power. Power he may abuse.
Blockchain solves this problem by giving everyone a copy of the ledger, and all copies march in lockstep using some cool math to keep them linked. This means no 3rd party has total control.
The advantage of immutablity are exactly that; it is unalterable. It is the record of truth that cannot lie. It cannot be revised, tampered with, vandalised or deleted.

Forget mining you cannot mine on a home pc. Mining requires specialist hardware called ASICS. A basic one will cost you a couple of thousand dollars, and it will probably take a year to mine enough bitcoin to cover that cost, and it's obsolete in 2. Also your landlord will probably evict you because these things are absolute *hogs* when it comes to electricity. Seriously if you don't cool them they will *melt*.
If you want to get into bitcoin buy $20 worth and experiment with different wallet types. Get a feel for it. But mining bitcoin is an industrial operation it's not something you can do on the cheap.
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:01:55
Yes but those would require prices of $40,000 and $400,000 per BTC respectively. I do expect bitcoin to eventually reach those kinds of valuations, but not next week or the week after.
I think the "standard unit" will be something of a moving target until bitcoin eventually stabilises (my guess would be somewhere in the ballpark of a million dollars).
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:17:31
If you have to ask this question then you should not be mining. It's an industry, not a hobby.

No, you're just an idiot.
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:36:37
I'm assuming the 100 computers are free as well. Well at that point if your investment is zero then if you are able to mine even 1 dollar of bitcoin then you are profitable, but now you are presenting a hypothetical scenario which is not realistic.
Even if, somehow, you could do this (keeping in mind that if you are using employer or university electricity you will be sacked/expelled and probably arrested) then your hurdle here is going to be lack of technical knowledge. 
Unless you really really understand what you are doing, you won't be able to mine. By your own admission you know pretty much nothing about bitcoin. So going from that to mining is trying to fly before you can crawl.
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:19:24
There's two ways this could happen.
1. Bitcoin goes up in value.
2. Dollars go down in value.
The US dollar (like all fiat currencies) loses value every year *by design*, so in that regard with constant inflation a bitcoin would eventually be worth $1 million, although you'd be paying $500 for a loaf of bread.
The other way is bitcoin goes up as more people use it. The supply is fixed therefore the more users the thinner the pool has to be spread. This will push price up.
Ultimately I do think bitcoin will reach $1 million dollars through a combination of both of these.
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:22:55
No because your problem here is efficiency. 100 computers will use a lot of electricity, and even combined would output a relatively poor hash rate. You would spend far more on your electricity bill than you would ever get back from mining the bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:40:41
No, because every encryption algorithm has a shelf life. Eventually SHA-256 will be crackable and we will all have to upgrade.
At that point I can see cracking long dead addresses as being something akin to legal salvage. Like salvaging gold doubloons from a sunken pirate ship.
This would reintroduce those long lost bitcoins back into general circulation.

Na. In the words of Caprica 6, all of this has happened before, all of this will happen again. I remember after the mtgox bubble/crash the price eventually stabilised in 2015, and it traded between about $220 and $240 for like 9 months. 
That was necessary. After such a crazy bubble we needed an extended period of just going sideways. We had a crazy bubble at the end of 2017, and now we're going sideways. This is part of a healthy reset.

OK few questions there.
1. Is now a good time? I'd say there is never a bad time. Do what I do last Friday of the month I buy bitcoin. I don't pay attention to the price I just take a certain percentage of my salary that I can comfortably afford to spare and buy bitcoin with it and throw it in with the rest.
2. How much is ideal? Start small. Your level of investment should be directly related to your understanding of bitcoin
3. What website will allow you to withdraw it in future? Work on the assumption that NONE of them will. This is the absolutely no 1. iron clad golden rule do not forget rule of bitcoin; NEVER have someone else hold your keys. If you leave your keys on the website you are trusting them not to lose/steal/get hacked. Pro-tip; don't do that. Buy a trezor or a ledger nano they cost about $100 US.

I agree with you I don't think the 2MB hard fork will go ahead because if anyone is really dead set on bigger blocks, well there's Bitcoin Cash. I think this is a good thing because it provides a release valve. BCH takes some of the pressure off, and with the pressure off there is no real pressing reason for a contentious 2x hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:00:26
I would say so, even without scaling. Even if the bitcoin blockchain never scaled from this point on, it would still be ready to steal the crown of "ultimate safe haven" from gold. Indeed if we never scaled, due to the high fees that's probably what bitcoin would become. A $100 fee isn't really a problem if you're trying to move $250,000, and its a transaction you only do a few times in your entire life.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:32:18
Then you have an economic imperative to do a hard fork to a larger block size. I think that's really the objection it's not that we should never hard fork ever, only that we only hard fork if we absolutely must.

No. The point of a hardware wallet is that the private key is never exposed to an online system. A wallet *app* is, pretty much by definition, NOT a cold wallet. It's a hot wallet which is fine for "spare change" but anything more than a few hundred dollars I'd invest in an actual hardware wallet they are not expensive.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:54:50
Just buy it. Mining is a hyper competitive industry, and the key word there is "industry" it's something that is done on an *industrial* scale. The days of mining on your graphics card are long gone. If you want to get into cryptocurrency fantastic; buy $10 dollars worth and practice sending 50 cents back and forth to yourself between various wallet types, get a feel for it. But leave the mining to experts with a lot of capital.

The difficulty retargets every 2016 blocks if I remember correctly, which at 10 minutes per block is once every 2 weeks. A 90% overnight drop in hashrate would (assuming we only just had a difficulty adjustment) mean that it would take around 20 weeks until we get to the next difficulty adjustment, assuming the remaining miners did not bring more hash power online to take advantage of the fact that 90% of their competition got Thanos'd.
20 weeks, it's not a long time. Basically bitcoin has a rough 4 months. Transaction confirmation times suck, and we get some congestion. Then the difficulty retargets and it's Shangri-La for the remaining miners because all their competition is gone.
This is not a doomsday scenario. There has been periods in the past where bitcoin has had to be mined below cost, so miners make a loss on every block. The difference this time is they know exactly how long it will be. The difficulty will retarget, and it will do so in worst case scenario 2016 blocks.
Even if this, frankly impossible, doomsday scenario actually happened I'm sure the bitcoin network could power through until the next difficulty adjustment, the back log of transactions would get mined, hash power would start to grow again, and bitcoin will honey badger on.

At block 1,470,000 the block reward will be halved to 0.39062500 BTC. This will be the 7th "halvening" and will occur in or very near 2036.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:38:47
I'm not familiar with "replace by fee" although I know some wallets support that feature. Best thing to do unless you really know what you are doing; nothing. Just wait. One of two things will happen:
1. The transaction will go through *eventually* although it might take a day or so.
2. The transaction will not go through, and after a few days will be dropped from the mempool and the coins will show up back in your wallet (technically, they haven't left).
So basically your transaction is stuck in low fee limbo it'll either go through or get bounced back to you and you can send it again with a higher fee. Try not to worry about it. Done it myself more than once.

I always say there's never a bad time to buy. Do what I do I get my salary on the last Friday of the month, and I take a certain amount of that, lets say £100, and I buy as much bitcoin as £100 gets me. I don't really pay attention to the exchange rate I just buy £100 worth. Maybe it's less than last month, maybe it's more. Doesn't really matter. I take that bitcoin and throw it in cold storage. I've been doing that for 6 years now and I plan on "hodling" at least through the 2024 halvening. I'm currently hoping to cash out in 2029 so that's 3 halvenings away. If I can retire on my 45th birthday I think I'll be doing well :)

Without disclosing what I have, my plan is quite straightforward. Do not consider this to be financial advice but I do think it's a good plan so, feel free to copy it.
Step 1. Wait until the unit price of BTC reaches my "trigger point". For me personally this is where the market cap of bitcoin achieves parity or exceeds the market cap for gold, which in current US dollars would be around $350,000 per coin.
At this point, I split my cold storage holdings into 3 equal allocations.
Allocation 1: this is used to buy residential property which I will lease. Given that 8% is a reasonable rate of return (i.e a $100,000 dollar property would fetch $8,000 per annum in rent), the annual income from this will put me in the top 1% or close to it. I can then retire and simply live off this as my pension for the rest of my life.
Allocation 2. I start a limited company and buy residential property in the company's name (with me as sole director). The difference this time is that I will use the proceeds from the sale of my bitcoin to put 20% down on each property with mortgages to cover the rest. So $1 million would translate to 50 properties at $100,000 each you get the general idea. 
I will not make any money from allocation 2 for 25 years as the income will be going to paying off the mortgages, but I still have my own separate income from allocation 1 and, after 25 years, I own all the properties from both allocations mortgage free, which would result in an annual pre-tax income of several million dollars.
Allocation 3: remains in cold storage as BTC. This fund, if all goes to plan, will remain until cold storage until after I'm dead. This is a nest egg for my future grandchildren and great grandchildren. I'm only 35 so hopefully it'll be a long while before anyone is looking to tap into this fund and I'm hoping by the end of this century the price of a single bitcoin will be beyond astronomical. 
Allocation 3 also serves as my insurance fund in the event of some sort of "get out of the country now" scenario like a communist revolution where they purge all the rich people (like the Kulaks in the Ukraine 100 years ago). But that's a doomsday scenario, all going to plan it'll just sit there for another for 70 years or so.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:40:12
I guess everyone has their own personal bite point.
I expect bitcoin to disrupt gold, and start cannibalising gold's market share as a store of value. The total gold market cap is something like 7 or 8 trillion USD.
If bitcoin's cap achieves parity with gold that's a per coin price of around $350,000. At that point I'd cash out 2/3rds of my stash and retire. 
The other 3rd I will never cash out. That's for my kids and grandkids after I am gone, and I'm only 35 so I'm hoping that's quite a long way yet.
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:11:14
I tried installing one and it I know it has to sync up to the current blockchain starting with the genesis block, so I expected that to take a week or so. Turns out it would take my *brand new $2,000 PC* about 3 MONTHS of continuous syncing to fully catch up.

If you had bitcoin on Coinbase before the fork assuming they didn't do something nefarious you should have the exact same amount of bitcoin on Coinbase after the fork.
What a lot of exchanges did is, post fork, automatically credit your account with the newly created bitcoin cash, since if you had 1 bitcoin before the fork you now have 1 of each post fork, although from what I understand actually doing this is a bit tricky so Coinbase might have had technical issues giving people the new coin.

Strictly speaking that could happen right now. A block is solved every 10 minutes **on average**. So there is a small but non-zero probability that the miners could just be very unlucky and go a full 24 hours without finding a single block.

Really the 2 have nothing to do with each other. After the fork whatever coins you have now will be cloned on the new splinter blockchain, regardless of where you store them.

Cost averaging works well. You take a set amount of money, say $100, and a set time interval, say the last Friday of every month. You buy whatever $100 gets you.

You are skirting quite close to labour theory of value here. Mining cost per unit does not set a price floor for bitcoin. The price can, and has, dipped below that. Bitcoin is worth what someone else is willing to pay for it and if that's below mining cost well sucks to be a miner.
Bitcoin is mildly inflationary because the supply of coins increases over time. That is the correct definition of inflation; an increase in the supply of money.
In terms of prices bitcoin exhibits deflationary effects because demand grows faster than supply.

Do what I do. I take a set amount of my salary on the last Friday of every month (not enough to be missed) and I buy however much bitcoin that nets me, and throw it into cold storage. I've been doing that for about 6 years now and I'm not about to stop.

My biggest concern is the cash settled futures market. For those who don't follow this stuff (most people) what they are is basically receipts for bitcoin, except when the due date comes you just redeem for cash rather than the bitcoin itself. My concern is two fold:
1. Far more receipts will be printed than there are bitcoin in circulation, or even bitcoin that can ever exist. We see this in the gold and silver markets at the COMEX where the value of the value of the contracts for gold and silver totals to about 100 or 200 times the value of *actual* gold and silver. It's insane, but that's what happens.
2. The tail ends up wagging the dog, and the futures market ends up dictating the price of actual honest to god you hold your own private keys bitcoin.
Long story short I'm very concerned that legacy markets might use "paper bitcoin" to do an end run around the network's hard limit of 21 million mineable coins, suppressing price and really destroying the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin itself.

I don't know. I don't know how high the next bull market will go. Maybe the next bubble will get us to 100k maybe it won't. 
What I personally am going to do, and I've been a hodler since 2013 I sat through the ATH of 2017, is I'm going to sit out the next bubble as well. If we get 100k in 2022 or something then crash to 15k, fine. I'm just going to hodl and wait.
I'm going to wait for the peak of the bubble after that one, because that'll be the last wave up and the last wave is always the big one. 
We saw that in 2017 we went 3k, crash, 5k, crash, then all the way up to 20k and that was the end of the cyclical bull. But if you zoom out we've hit 20k, crash, so I think this pattern is playing out on a larger scale and we've only seen the first of 3 peaks.
I will definitely cash out at the peak of the 3rd because that would mark the end of the *secular* bull and the beginning of the secular bear. Secular markets are generational so the ATM we hit at the peak of of the final wave might be a record that will stand for 10, 15 or even 20 years.
So TL;DR don't cash out next peak, catch the one after it, but definitely catch that one because your unborn kids might be going to college before we see another bubble like it.

I agree unit bias is a problem. Humans just aren't comfortable dealing in values that have 6 or 8 numbers after the decimal, and especially not if the first two or three are "0". It just becomes to abstract and you have to think "but how much is that *really*?".
We should have already have transitioned to a new unit notation by now. One I've been trying to promote hoping it catches on is the "μbit". The prefix "μ" is just pronounced "U" and is scientific notation that denotes 10 to the -6, or 1 millionth. As 1 BTC is divisible down to 10 to the -8 this works out quite well because this would allow pricing to two decimal places, which is what we already have. So "nine ninety-five" would mean 9 ubits and 95 satoshis. Plus, 1 ubit at current prices is pretty close to parity with 1 US cent, so we're back to dealing in values equivalent to something we're already far more familiar with.
Being able to buy 10,000 ubits for $100 maybe be functionally the same as buying 0.01 of a bitcoin, but it's more psychological satisfying and just easier to keep a mental track of.

That's actually a very deliberate design choice. If you start including other considerations about what the hash power could be used *for* then you are introducing a new set of incentives that could upset the balance.
The whole point of the game theory incentives securing the network is that if they try to cheat they lose their stake, the "stake" being the electricity spent mining. That is sunk cost.
But if they could put that hashing power to other uses then they could potentially have incentives to cheat because they lose their stake but perhaps make more money doing something else (like leasing their computing power to a big lab for complex calculations).
The simple straightforward "all or nothing" nature of mining ensures is fundamental to its trustless nature.

I'm a long term HODLer and will continue to do so for another 5 years at least (for reference I'm 35 years old just now). Once bitcoin hits a point where I think it's worth cashing in I'm going to split my stash into 3 equal portions. 
Portion 1 is me set for life. I can retire in my early 40's and live a comfortable lifestyle and never work again.
Portion 2 goes back into cold storage until I'm in my 60s. I'm hoping by 2045 that will be worth a truly insane amount of money and I can use that to fund something very ambitious (like Musk using the money he got selling PayPal to found SpaceX).
Portion 3 stays in cold storage until after I'm dead and gone (hopefully at the age of 106). That is for my descendants who haven't been born yet.

I don't worry about government regulation in the long term. Governments are incapable of effective cooperation there could never be a real coordinated global crackdown it'll always be fragmented and if one country is hostile to it another will be welcoming, if for no other reason than to undermine some other country it considers a rival.
Also truly oppressive regimes do not last. They are inherently self destructive. So over the very long term (100 years say) I expect regulatory attitude to ebb and flow, and because bitcoin really is unstoppable code it always stays one step ahead.
That's actually a major reason I have that last 3rd set aside even though I'll be long dead the idea is that if things really did get too hairy on Earth for whatever reason (oppressive totalitarian regimes, World War 3, The Church of Greta Tromberg) my descendants would have enough money they could just bug out. Emigrating to Mars or something is science fiction in 2019 but in 2109? Maybe it's something you really could do if you were wealthy enough.

Never keep bitcoin on the exchange. Rule no. 1 of bitcoin; hold your own private keys. Rule no 2 of bitcoin. HOLD YOUR OWN PRIVATE KEYS.
If your bitcoin is on the exchange your keys are hosted by the exchange. So simple good practice dictates you move your bitcoin into a wallet you control such as a phone wallet, desktop client, or cold storage such as a hardware wallet.
To protect your bitcoin during a fork just don't do any transactions that day. Just wait it out and let the dust settle nothing will happen to your bitcoins.

I think there is something to the concept of the Elliot Wave. Bull markets come in waves with 3 peaks. Why 3? Because the market is a reflection of human psychology and there seems to be something satisfying to us about the count of 3. I suspect that the 2017 high at $20,000 was wave 1 of a decade spanning secular bull market. If they stay roughly in staggered lock step with the halving (i.e. both repeating in 4 year intervals, 2 years out of sync) then we should be very near the bottom of this cyclical bear, and the final peak of the secular bull (the 3rd and final wave) should be in about 6 years or so.

Of course sooner or later I just buy the damn laptop. It's a balancing act between spending now and spending later. Bitcoin hodlers today are so dedicated because they expect bitcoin to appreciate in value by orders of magnitude. They would not be so die hard if it only appreciated 2% per year.

Yes and no. You could not enter "JaneIhateyou" as a destination address because it's not an address. Your wallet would just give you an error message telling you it's not a valid format. You can add a bit of extra data however to a spend transaction using OP\_RETURN which another user mentioned. That means you've created a spend transaction with the message attached to it, although keep in mind the more data you include the bigger the mining fee you'll have to stump up to get it mined into a block.

When miners mint new coins the coins come into existence at that point. When they create a block, the miner essentially pays themselves 12.5 new coins that they themselves just created right then. But it works because this is in line with the consensus algorithm. If they tried to award themselves 100 coins the block would be rejected by the rest of the network.
We're all counting up to 21 million along an agreed trajectory, and new coins are created at the moment of mining provided it is the expected amount.

Bitcoin is not a method for generating passive income. It generates *zero* income. It doesn't pay a dividend or anything like that. In that sense bitcoin is a bit of a pet rock. 
Also if your investing timeline is only 12 months, you aren't doing investing right. You'd be better off just going to the casino with your $600 and having some fun with it and hoping you walk up slightly up.
Buying $600 worth of bitcoin and just holding it for (minimum) 5 years will probably make you a decent overall return but don't look at passive income yet you are not at that stage.
Also; ALL cloud mining sites are scams! Stay away!

The idea is that bitcoin will ultimately process billions of transactions per day. Even at 1 penny per transaction, that's a hell of a lot of money up for grabs in mining fees.

By definition the ultra rich will have the most, however I don't think bitcoin will be as "top heavy" as the current system. In the current system money is simply created from nothing, and \*given\* to the ultra rich. Bitcoins have to be mined and a good chunk of that sold into the open market.
The people who own massive amounts of bitcoin will eventually spend that bitcoin, which puts it back into general circulation. That combined with the fact that they can't just print more will I think over time even out the distribution a bit.

But at the same time, in order to function as a global daily use currency, that currency would have to have a market cap equivalent to several trillion US dollars. So how does it go from zero to n trillion *without exponential growth*?
Bitcoin's use changes as it bootstraps. At first it was nothing more than an interesting computer science experiment, then it was a dark web currency, then it was a speculative asset, and now its starting to catch on as a store of value
One day it will have achieved a level of scale that makes it very hard to move the needle so it maintains a roughly stable value from one year to the next and viola you have something that can be used as a day to day currency. But first it has to grow, exponentially.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:04:44
Yes but that's due to massive user adoption. We can't keep gaining new users ad infinitum eventually we'll reach a point where bitcoin only appreciates in value at about the same rate the economy grows which is a few % points a year and not this exponential bootstrapping phase we're in now.

"Fiat" literally means "let it be so". *Fiat* currencies like US dollars or Japanese Yen exist and have exchange value simply because the state declares that they should, and backed by the power of the state.
Free market currencies like gold or bitcoin are currencies that people have *chosen* to use. Gold has been a standard for about 5000 years because people all across the world all came to the same conclusion that gold is useful as currency. Lots of things have been tried; stones, feathers, sea shells, but through trial and error we all zero in on the best solutions we all naturally came to the same conclusion.
That's the difference free market currencies are chosen because they best fill that role, fiat currencies are forced on to us.
My point about a redistributive cryptocurrency is pretty straightforward lets say bitcoin worked this way. Let's say every 1000 blocks the algorithm rebalanced all wallet addresses, taking from the richest and giving to the poorest, to keep everyone within a certain range of each other.
Well what's the point of having it? If you cannot accumulate it there's no point in holding it. It's punishing it's own users for having too much of it. People would just stop using it and use a different cryptocurrency. I also think it'll come down to the top few, but a cryptocurrency that worked on such a basis would not be one of them.
I'm against the idea of UBI in general because it cannot work. If you can get by without working, some people will choose not to. Which means less productive people producing the money to cover the cost of UBI in the first place. Which puts a greater burden on the productive, so more of them will simply abandon work and live off UBI, further increasing the burden on the ever shrinking pool of the productive.
If you want an analogy imagine 100 people pulling a cart. But 5 people can't, so we let them ride in the cart. But now there are 5 less people pulling a heavier cart. So 5 more people decide to just ride in the cart so now it's 90/10. Soon it's 80/20, then 70/30. Soon there's more people in the cart than there are pulling it and the last of them say "ah screw this!", and you're Venezuela.
I think there's something to be said for a bit of fear. The idea that if you don't work hard, study hard, hold a steady job etc then you'll end up on the street, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Too much of a safety net makes people lazy so the threat of destitution if you screw up provides a bit of much needed discipline.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:00:49
Your last question is actually the most straightforward so I'll answer that first. I don't think cryptocurrency will stop. I think a world where people use bitcoin in daily transactions like unthinkingly buying a coffee at Starbucks is still a decade away, but I think we will get there and we will surpass that. I think within 20 years not only will bitcoin do everything our financial system does today, but it will do things that haven't even been invented yet.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies like it are programmable money that makes them essentially infinitely versatile. I don't think we've begun to scratch the surface of their potential any more than a computer programmer in the early 1980's could have predicted Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, iTunes etc.
Could a cryptocurrency ever replace fiat currency? Well I think they should, and in 10 or 20 years might have developed enough where they could, whether or not they ever will I don't know.
The problem is actually the answer to your question our government absolutely could not function (at least not as it functions today) on a sound money standard. "Sound money" being money that has some build in limit on supply such as gold, silver, or a cryptocurrency with a pre-set limit such as bitcoin's 21 million coins.
It's important to realise what fiat currency really is it is essentially the cocaine of finance. Governments hate sound money because sound money has a limit on supply. Limited money means limited *power*. It means unlimited ability to go into *debt*. Therefore governments are always trying to break free of the bounds of sound money and into a world of "type whatever I want into my bank account" money. That is what fiat money is it is just printing money (in any other world that would be called "counterfeiting").
That's what happened during World War 1 everyone thought the war would be over within 6 months because both sides would run out of gold to pay for the war. But instead they instituted fiat currency and the war lasted 4 years because you can't run out of money if your bank balance is whatever you say it is.
The problem is because fiat currency is debt (for reasons which I can elaborate on if you wish), it's doomed. Fiat currencies are from day 1 unstable and doomed to collapse the problem is that once you are *on* a fiat currency standard, its very hard to get off. So it really is like a drug you either come off the fiat standard and back to a sound money standard (which no one has ever done willingly) and this would cause massive economic upheaval, or you ride it into the ground, and you have massive economic upheaval. You either go cold turkey and suffer the withdrawal symptoms. Or you overdose and die. There is no good way out of it. Fiat currency, not even once kids.
All fiat currencies collapse. Like I said they are flawed by design I think the global average lifespan of a fiat currency is about 27 years or something ridiculous like that. Even the US dollar in its current form is only about 45 or so. The currency of my home country, the British pound, is very much the exception having lasted about 200 years but then it has lost 99% of its value in those 200 years.
If you ever wondered where the term "pound sterling" comes from, it literally means that. £1 was 1 pound (16 ounces) of sterling silver. 16oz of silver at today's prices is probably pretty close to £200.
Governments would never willingly adopt a cryptocurrency standard. A bitcoin standard would not be entirely dissimilar to a gold standard which the US government spent 100 years trying to ditch, for the simple reason that sound money, limited money, keeps you grounded in economic reality.
Governments function by providing the illusion of something for nothing, and they can only do that via unlimited debt and the ability to just print whatever money they need at will, and like I said once you start down that road the only way the hard way you either come off it and suffer horrendously or you go until it collapses and suffer horrendously.

No it's not the current way of doing things because fiat currency, by definition, is not opt in. It is declared *by fiat* it does not emerge organically out of the free market like gold or cryptocurrencies.
You MUST pay your taxes. You MUST pay them in the national fiat currency. What the state does with them from there you can't really control.
A cryptocurrency must attract users it's opt in not mandatory, and a cryptocurrency build on a set of rules that penalises the acquisition of its native tokens is disincentivising users who are free to choose any other of the 2000 odd existing cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:46:32
Then I refer you back to my original statement. Bitcoin's volatility is due to relatively a small market cap and user base. I do think that bitcoin will reach a point in the future where it is used my a sizeable percentage of the global population and would have an accordingly high market cap, at which point volatility would be reduced to a few percentage points per year.
This would not only make it as stable as major fiat currencies it would also remove the incentive to "hodl", as your returns would only be 2-3% per year not the 500-1000% returns we see today.

I've held a substantial (more than 10 less than 100) number of coins on a paper wallet for some years now. Its still there. I prefer paper wallets over hardware wallets because honestly I've had so many usb flash drives die on me I wouldn't want that to happen to a trezor with 6 figures in bitcoin on it.
Low-tech all the way. Just be sure to generate them offline (I used a 13 year old laptop which never connects to the internet), make a few back up copies. You can BIP38 encrypt them with a password so that even *if* one was stolen, the funds cannot be redeemed right away they would have to brute force your password (although in the event that I had a paper wallet "unaccounted for", I would create a new one and move my coins over as a matter of course).
You sacrifice convenience for security, but in terms of security (properly generated offline) nothing beats them in my opinion.

Ah right so including the witness data it would be 8MB?

@_date: 2017-07-19 18:54:10
Probably, but then I don't really fault them for that. Bitcoin belongs to everyone which means it does belong to the miners too. I don't think moving to 2MB blocks (after almost 9 years) is unreasonable.

I think the BitcoinABC devs are dead set on forking off the main chain but I think its safe to say it will be the minority chain. A vanishing minority at that. At best they create an alt-coin.

I very much doubt BitcoinABC has anywhere near that kind of support.

I think its a cultural thing. At the Hong Kong agreement (as far as I'm aware please correct me if I'm wrong) the consensus was segwit, followed about 6 months later with a 2MB hardfork.
Instead what they got was segwit with no hardfork and I think that rubbed the Chinese miners the wrong way. Its a "my word is my bond" sort of thing they expected the devs to honour the agreement and since segwit2x basically is that agreement that's why its gotten traction with the miners.
Personally I don't see why a 2MB hardfork is so contentious. We need *some* on chain scaling and doubling the block size once every 9 years doesn't seem very radical.

Do NOT trade bitcoin you will lose. 1% of pro traders make 99% of the money and noobs like yourself are just canon fodder.
If you want to get into bitcoin do what I do; buy, hodl, forget. I get paid on the last Friday of the month and I use a certain (small) percentage of my salary to buy some bitcoin, whatever the exchange rate is I don't even pay attention to that really. I then deposit that bitcoin in a growing cold storage wallet and forget about it. Then do the same next month.
Do that and you will make far more money than you will ever make trading.

I like the idea of a ubit. The Greek "u" meaning micro or 10 to the power of -6.
So 1 ubit would be 100 satoshis. A coffee at 2.95 would be 2 ubits and 95 satoshis, or 295 satoshis.
This 2 decimal places system is how dollars, euros, pounds etc all work so it's pretty familiar and intuitive, and it avoids ungainly numbers like paying 120,000 satoshis for dinner for 2.

Increased velocity would actually drive price *down*, all other things being equal of course. 
I think the reason bitcoin has dropped so much is simple; you can't appreciate in value 2,000% in 12 months. It's simply not sustainable.
At current prices we're still about 350% what we were in January 2017. More than tripling in 2 years? Most stocks can only dream of performance like that. 20x in 12 months? That's a mania, and this bear market was as necessary as it was well deserved.
