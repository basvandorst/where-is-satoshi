ITT: people who don't understand that this sign is clearly satire, and they WANT you to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-26 23:33:23
Yes, Bitcoin is simply on a sale!

No it's fine, all you have to do is yell "SOVEREIGN CITIZEN" and they legally can't do anything to you. I read that once.

Considering the job Google did to promote Google wallet over the years (or the lack thereof), Google is the biggest threat to Google Wallet's business model.

As long as you can afford your rent that's fine and dandy. The post otherwise looks like you're choosing between rent and buying more coin.

It's like if someone know how much money you have in your bank account or PayPal. Sure, the money isn't in danger, but that's your personal business.
But if they find out you're secretly a millionaire, then you might be in danger.

Yeah... that's what people were saying in 2013. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Because it's not just about buying and selling, it's how many people buying vs how many are selling. An extremely simplified version: Fewer buyers than sellers = price tends to decrease (like now, a bunch of people sell at $1000, and as the price drops, more people are *inclined* to sell while fewer buy). So just because someone is selling something doesn't mean there will always be a buyer for it. Think of it like ill-fitting jeans at a store. Not many are going to buy it at full price, so they reduce the price until they start selling.
Several months ago, more people were willing to buy Bitcoin and less willing to sell, and the price increases. This price increase contributes to more buyers and fewer sellers, until equilibrium happens or a lot of people suddenly sell (like now).

My first Bitcoin purchase was a set of pots and pans back in 2014 from overstock.com.
We still use them, they're high quality. Which they'd better be because I paid 0.2 BTC for them. $200 then is like $1800 now...

America was already like that in 1995, don't know if you're old enough to remember.
Also, this has very little to do with Bitcoin except for the usual "wake up sheeple!" edgleord mating call.

Even bigger shout out to the people who BOUGHT! The price wouldn't be recovering if there wasn't a demand for it. Keeping the demand high keeps the price high. There are no crashes, only sales!

You're right, stupid is too harsh a descriptor, unwise is more apt.
It's just I hate it when I see people going all-in, gung-ho, wallets blazing, but its value might drop another 25% in the next several months still (that is complete speculation on my part with zero evidence to back it up). I understand the enthusiasm, and I certainly want bitcoin to be successful, but you gotta hedge your bets. Not doing so is just making the rest of the adopters look bad.

So what you're saying is that bitcoin's value changes far more dramatically in much less time than the US dollar, which would make it MORE volatile... 
Unless your definition of volatility only counts when something *decreases* in purchasing power to suit your argument...

You didn't lose if you did not sell. But if you invested your entire life savings in it (and therefore "lost" a third of it due to the price dropping) then maybe you should divest a little bit for a fallback?
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:34:51
