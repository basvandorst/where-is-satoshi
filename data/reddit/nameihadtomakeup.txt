Agreed but if your opinion is it is the future then it is a great time to buy. My only concern is govt regulation but they can’t regulate weed for the last 79 years? So I don’t think it is stoppable, for example the only reason I got in is bc mcafee said he would eat his own dick if it wasn’t a million by 2020 so I said hell I put a few hundred bucks on that so I spent a few hundred at 3500 and 20$ a week since then I’m up about 100% give or take the day. I also bought some doge some etc some Ltc some bsv all speculation in my analysis we have no way to analyze but I’ll put some cash down on the off chance our next reserve currency is a crypto

I agree with your strategy I don’t agree with your logic, respectfully. We can’t use technical analysis or fundamental analysis on crypto’s like we do on stocks. I don’t have a solution except observation and general understanding / lol speculation but we can’t use even wave analysis on crypto’s. Again I’m not trying to argue but respectfully I think the best argument for analysis would be something along the lines of forex trading but we can’t use that here yet either....until there is some base built in for study....the only thing we have to go on is liquidity and ability to use as far as crypto’s go currently. I’m long crypto’s because I think they are the future and in the future after enough data we can probably analyze them as a forex type currency but we aren’t there yet I.e. all we have is pure speculation and or faith they are the future. Which one is more accessible more usable faster hash rate faster transfer rate all tools of our analysis but I don’t think we have a market to properly analyze yet. Again, respectfully my opinion. I appreciate any other thoughts or opinions I just want you to know I’m not trying to be a dick.

Yea I have been trying to educate myself to a better understanding of crypto’s don’t totally get the details as I don’t use them to purchase things just a hodl. That’s why I expanded into other well known coins that I read are more usable. However everything seems to get converted back to bitcoin eventually.

Lol I was just messing around bc of your username

kyc means know your customer so it’s buying in a way that you lose your anonymity. Vs an atm converting fiat to bitcoins anonymously. Which I also don’t think is as anonymous as many people think unless you are using burner phones paid for with cash etc etc if authorities are watching you they know you just picked up btc at an atm
