If you holding large amounts it’s not nearly as secure as a hardware wallet or some of the other options
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:08:30
I’m fairly new to bitcoin and most of my transactions went through in 6 min or less this one took over 40 which is why I was worried

@_date: 2019-06-30 17:15:50
I already have the deposits section of coin base pro literally shows the transaction for the right amount and address but there’s no money available
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:48:18
Sure what’s your key
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:58:52
It’s just a part of the ride were still in a bull trend I don’t get why people are freaking out
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:20:11
So once it reaches 6 it should show up
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:29:17
Yeah just got confirmed thank god
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:18:05
I checked the transaction it only has 2/6 confirmations is that the reason why it’s not going through
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:12:02
18 min
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:12:54
Every transaction I’ve made to the account usually took only a couple of minutes that’s why I’m so worried
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:07:52
I know this probably sounds retarded but what does ATH stand for
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:04:27
Rip to the people who panic sold
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:25:56
Well it’s at 5 still hasn’t showed up let’s hope when it reaches 6 it does
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:05:34

@_date: 2019-06-16 18:21:05
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:23:22

A business has to make money somehow. Doubt they’re just showing people how to use bitcoin
