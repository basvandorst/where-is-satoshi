Coinbase is doing very well.

funny because this was how I had pre-explosion bitcoin to begin with as well

Yeah sorry I need I jump in here to assist in driving your point...
The whole point is to decentralize the commodity, and boast the public ledger. I understand where you are coming from with the potential for ultra power hubs, but the way Blockchain works is with a cumulative effort of computer power maintaining the public ledger.
In a nutshell, the whole point is transparency

You have my attention...

Honestly I don’t know that anything will succeed without bitcoin leading the way.
No one can deny the bubble we are experiencing right now... and no one can predict where the breaking point is

I am using your comment as a conduit to vocalize my boiling frustration as of late; this is not an attack on you...
We've got a huge influx of new buyers which is assisting in driving value through the roof, but these new buyers are uneducated and emotional (like we all were when we got into crypto). So right when price fluctuates, as its done forever, newbies sell instead of HODL and bomb market. This whole thing is a double-edged sword.

This is pretty cool. Don’t get hung up on “what could have been”. I know it’s difficult. Regret will only cloud your mind and turn you into a spiteful person. You’re better than that OP!

It’s coming!
However.... Not a very nice jab at Litecoin there

well said

I’m no expert but...
Coinbase is a reliable and proven system where these small transactions prove your account is legitimate. It is stressful because you want to quickly dive in, but necessary to ensure competency with their systems.

I will inevitability be downvoted to hell for this but I believe in Litecoin as a resilient market. I believe in the creator, the method, and the potential.
I also have heavily invested in it so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

Coinbase crushed consumers and US Gov.

Someone else will undoubtedly reply with a much more educated response than mine, but my belief is no. It seems as though it is being even more embraced over the last month or so per the recent futures announcement.

Moms spaghetti!!
..oh sorry

Coinbase was crushed by consumer demand, as well as the united states government

First: 100 “nillion” is absolutely unattainable.
Second: you rant like the POTUS and I just cant
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:56:26
I appreciate the integrity but please don’t mate... please don’t!!!

I just sold $300 on April 12th when it was @ ~$1200...
Crap.
