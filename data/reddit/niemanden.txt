I'm appalled by your comment. Please recall it to mind when the USD is worth about as much as toilet paper.

Some would say that males embrace risk to attract females. I'm not saying every firefighter is a horndog, but I'm pretty sure it's a factor in many career decisions.

Now they're doing it to the Euro. My buddy says the same thing as you, so I assume you're also a Keynesian. Keynes fundamental premise seems to me to have been that all currency is fiat currency. And as such, you can do whatever you want with it. To me, this is abstract. Too much so to be "real."
The Austrians are different. The simple fact that you can't eat gold means, to the Austrian at least, that food is the basis for all economy. This resonates much more with me, because the one thing people can NOT stop doing (especially Americans!) ... is eat!
So the bankers are playing a fiat game worldwide. Now it's the Euro. The dollar is only strong because they're weakening the Euro.
It's just another bubble. One bubble to another bubble is just the Keynesian way. And what happens when the music stops? Same thing that happened in late 2008... only THIS time, on a global scale. 
What I'm talking about is global economic darkness. This is different than finance, IMO, because finance is really the problem, not the solution. And yet more and more debt is the only "solution" that the Keynesian bankers know how to do.
Have you noticed that the only thing people ever do to traffic is add lanes? The finance people are the least imaginative among us, believe me. These guys are goons.
So just wait. You can have the last laugh, and I hope you do! But what they're doing now is sheer insanity and the Germans know it. Which is why they're dragging their feet bailing out the Euro.

Haha, schrutebucks. Thanks for this info. I don't have a raped ape anyway. Too expensive. And they require a 600 watt power source.

I'm a newbie, just lurking, reading, trying to educate myself.
Question: If I had a "raped ape" of a machine, wouldn't I be able to mine bitcoins without my information going into a block chain? And I'll take my answer off the air...

Web-socket mining? Doesn't that just give you data about other mining operations? 
Not sure what you're saying. If you could dumb it down, I'd appreciate it.
