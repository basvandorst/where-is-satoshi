Exactly. You get it.

Sorry for not being clear, the above situation is not real. It's just an example. 
I am okay with setting up my own storefront, probably won't take much time. But the constraints are where. If you are aware of hosting providers which would allow it, do let me know. 
Also, just to let you know, the kits I am talking about is not really like "press the key to hack" type, they do require a person to have some level of comfort with command line and stuff.

Product name contained "Penetration", "Hack"; account immediately closed and suspended. :)

Gonna try that out. :)

You can list any hosting companies that'll be okay with bitcoin stuff? I might actually end up using electrum seed with WordPress + WooCommerce though, but better safe than sorry.

You wanna buy the kits? ;)

That's a very good question. 
Consider this scenario: I am selling you a machine installed with Kali itself, but for much cheaper. Say, a standard compatible laptop would cost you about $800-$1200 to have enough power to operate tools in an effective way. But now say, I can offer you hardware to do the same thing much cheaper because it's specialized for it. Say, $600 for a much much more powerful wireless receptor which is capable of far more powerful stuff that your $1000 machine.
(As a matter of fact, these hardware are capable of running Kali with special set of installed binaries to use the hardware, but ships with a special build of Linux with few tools only)
Moreover, Kali/Backtrack is not capable enough to leave "no-footprint" but specialized hardware that is capable of broadcasting random data is.
If you are into Bitcoin, you can relate this to Bitcoin miners vs home computers. 
Haven't you seen agents carrying big black boxes? (okay, pun intended)

That's right. It will be quite easy to setup my own, but the problem is that my hosting provider and/or domain providers would shut that down even from a single complaint. Especially since it includes both Bitcoin as well as Hacking.

I've already got the payments working, including storing bitcoins.
Also, I'd totally prefer my own solution over using anything which is just a hosted version for the same.

Interesting. 
Quite a few of my programs are like software-only, so I can probably sell them this way. But quite a few of them are hardware and I need a place to list and sell them too.
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:28:47
I am gonna dig into that. ;)

I was pretty sure that's gonna come up. Those are 0-day right now, I have reported them. Few of them are major and would take about a month of fix and deploy. I have not made them openly exploitable, but the hardware instance does allow to test it. (As a matter of fact, one of the endpoint actually includes some financial stuff and I have disabled it in the application)
Most of these kits are to test your own apps and not to exploit other apps, only about 5% of the kits actually exploit known vulnerability in other apps and programs. (Like Router stuff..)
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:18:27
I'll tell you something. There's a league of hackers, where you are allowed to share these exploits with one-another, but after some response from the affected group. 
These exploits can only be sold to verified penetration testers and/or government officials. They'll never land into the wrong hands if you don't have the letter of approval. :)

As of what I have looked up, I can keep them as bitcoins since I can put up that much of cash in reserve.
PS: I work for firm and they do pay me, and that's enough for my living.
