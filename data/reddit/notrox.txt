This guy is local to me and I have this urge to punch him in the face.

Lucky bastard. Sigh

This world needs more humans like you Sean.

yeah I'm using 0.8.  I did stop in the middle to update the client, I'm sure this didn't help.

After the first hack, I'm surprised people still have so much faith in them.

Gox can't handle BTC, why should we trust them with LTC?

Why are they communicating all of a sudden. Where were the tweets and Facebook posts yesterday?

He has zero sales on that site. I'm not shocked.  With those fees I wonder if he's the son of a Bank of America branch manager.

Amazing work. Are you a  Food Not Bombs chapter or flying solo?

[OP Knows what's up](  Amiga days. Most kids that love him were not thought of yet or just breast feeding. I think that's why he's really butt hurt with the feds, because he helped them before and they still destroyed his business.  He is no stranger to snitching.
