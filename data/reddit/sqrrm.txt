Currently there are three, basically the founders of the project. There is however a plan to make the arbitrator a bonded role as part of DAO. To read more about the Bisq DAO see

Yes, without the bank account information it wouldn't be possible to transact using banks, but this information is only shared with that one counter party, no one else in the network knows about it.

Bisq can be found at bisq.network. You need to download the software and run locally. Each peer is part of the Bisq network which runs over tor. Since there is no central matching engine each trade is a done between two peers. BTC are kept in a multisig transaction with a third party arbitrator while fiat or altcoins are transacted outside of Bisq. Once the fiat transaction is completed the BTC are released.

There is a DAO being built around Bisq to motivate all kinds of contributors. You can read about it at

No ID is required to trade on Bisq, just account information depending on your mode of payment.
Credit cards are not supported due to the charge back risk.

Zelle seems to be the best option for people based in the US if your bank supports it.

Bisq is for BTC to and from both fiat and alt coins. One of the main thoughts behind it is that it's important to have a way to convert between fiat and bitcoin without giving up privacy. There is no need to share sensitive information with a centralized service that can later be hacked.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:35:22
It doesn't make sense to allow credit cards. First, users would have to be able to accept credit cards, that's not something most users would be able to do. If they could receive payments with credit cards there is still the charge back risk, the users would basically just trust have to trust each other making the whole point of a distributed system with distributed arbitrators void.

If you're selling BTC for GBP bisq.network works well. No hoops, just download app and sell BTC.

Manfred, who is the main developer, has quite openly declared his distaste for fork coins. Bisq is an open source project however and anyone can suggest additions. It's now possible to trade bcash, clashic and bitcoin gold for BTC on Bisq.

1) There is no need for ID. Only the information to process the non BTC side of the trade is needed, eg. bank account or alt coin info. This information is only shared with the peers you trade with.
2) It's not that easy to make a mobile app due to the system requirements and the fact that the app needs to keep running to be able to trade. Bisq is a distributed system, there is no server to connect to that can handle offers and matching, that's all handled peer to peer between you and the other party of the trade.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:40:56
You can trade quite a variety of alt coins on Bisq. It's also possible to submit a pull request to add new coins if the one you want to trade is not available.

For better privacy and up to 0.25 BTC per order you can try Bisq, the p2p distributed exchange. Read up on 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:02:12
For the privacy minded, and if you're with a bank on the Zelle network you can do p2p trades with Bisq to get USD directly to your bank account, see 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:51:05
For a p2p exchange, try 
No need for verification or KYC since it's p2p, but you'll need some BTC for security deposits before you can trade.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:06:36
There is Bisq for this, a p2p exchange. You only share your account details with the person you're buying from, no ID checks or KYC. You'll need some BTC to begin with though since it's required as security deposit held in mutlisig while doing trades. Read up on  to see if it might be for you.

It could well be that people will be interested in buying BSQ tokens even though they're neither contributors nor traders, I don't think it would be a problem, although too much volatility in the price of BSQ tokens would not be a good thing.
I was trying to explain the purpose of BSQ and why it doesn't matter if no one except for traders and contributors takes an interest in the BSQ token. Since the token is means as an internal distribution facility and not a fund raiser the system should work without any external funds.
There is no real insider information for contributors, except that they have spent time learning about Bisq. This means they might be better placed to predict the issuance rate and price of the BSQ token, but everything that happens around Bisq is as open as possible and anyone can take a look at github and slack to learn that same information. The issuance is quite predictable as every month the contributors have to request how much they want and only for work already completed. This means you could look at these requests to see how much will be issued during the next voting cycle. If you follow the project closely you would also be able to estimate if the issuance rate will rise or fall depending on the rate of contribution.

You can specify which full node you want to connect to if there isn't one running locally. If no bitcoin node is specified and none is find locally, Bisq will automatically connect to one of the nodes run by a federation of Bisq contributors.

The value of the BSQ token is that it can be used for paying the trade fee while trading on Bisq. If you don't trade on Bisq and don't contribute you dont have much reason to buy or hold the token.
The main holders of the BSQ token will likely be the contributors since they will rewarded tokens for their work. They can later sell the BSQ to traders to pay the trading fee. That way contributors, that naturally believe in Bisq, will issue and hold the BSQ until sold to traders that can burn the BSQ to pay the trading fee.
To me one of the main points of this DAO is the issuance to contributors as compensation and burning by traders as a way to pay the trade fee. The BSQ token then just becomes an intermediary in the value transfer from traders to contributors. The BSQ token is not intended to be traded or bought for speculation, only as a mean to facilitate the DAO built around Bisq.

It's only possible to use payment methods that are reasonably hard to reverse on Bisq. Paypal, cash app and similar methods are not available due to the ease of reversal. Zelle seems to work nicely in the US and SEPA in Europe for example.

No, but they can annoy the other person by making them wait for the timelocked tx to be spendable. They would also lose their own deposit, which should be set to a level that prevents this kind of behaviour.
@_date: 2019-10-25 14:26:54
This is a valid concern with bisq and the last main centralized point. A new version is coming soon, changing the protocol to a 2of2 with a presigned timelocked tx to handle the arbitration cases. It will look and feel pretty much the same as the previous protocol though, as it's still possible to take a trade to arbitration. More info can be found on 
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:09:47
The account information is only shared between peers in a trade since it wouldn't be possible to transfer money otherwise, like with you Zelle example.
The account verification is not sharing account information. It's only sharing information on the hash of account + salt. A web of trust of these hashes is built to be able to verify if a peer has been verified by other peers as a good counterparty in previous trades. You still only gain the information about the account when you partake in a trade with a peer, which also then allows you to check the status on the hash.
The dispute handling is changing somewhat in v1.2.0 but it won't look much different to the user. The main thing is to get rid of the arbitrator as a centralized point of trust which was one of the main weaknesses left in the bisq network.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:09:52
No, there is a max size per trade that's kept rather low on purpose to make the platform less attractive to scammers. To trade a larger amount you would have to do a lot of smaller trades. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:35:20
Bisq doesn't require, or allow, any ID or verification, see bisq.network for more info. It's a distributed exchange where you run your own node trading p2p with other users. After finding an offer you would send the fiat, eg. USD, directly to the other persons bank account or whichever payment method was decided on. They would know who you are but no one else could get this information.
To get started you will need some BTC though for a security deposit, this will be held in an escrow transaction until the trade is completed and is a security to make sure all parties follow the protocol.

There is a need for contributors with knowledge in Chinese payment systems and local bitcoin trading.

The Bisq network is a distributed exchange. You run your own node and connect to other users directly over tor. There is no centralized entity that can make you do anything. To secure trades there is however a third party to every trade, an arbitrator that's part of a 2 of 3 multisig escrow transaction. The fees are necessary for various reasons, one being that the arbitrators need to be incentivized. Have a look at  for more details.
Note that there is no centralized point here, the arbitrators are all individuals just like the rest of the network. Incentives must be built such that every agent in the network has an incentive to do the right thing, and without the fees for arbitrators they would have very little reason to keep doing it (apart from altruistic reasons).
To further distribute every aspect of Bisq a DAO is being built. This DAO will use the BSQ token as a way of compensating all kinds of contributors, not just arbitrators. It will also help with making incentives better aligned with the Bisq network. The tokens will initially be distributed to past contributors and new tokens issued as compensation for future contributions. To learn more about the Bisq Dao have a look at

The Indian market is currently not very liquid at all. I suspect there would be quite a demand for a distributed liquid exchange in India though, especially with the latest announcements and things like these.
If you're interested in helping getting the market started in India it would be great. Best way is to get on the Bisq slack and perhaps get a liquidity week going.
