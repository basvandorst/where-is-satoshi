Alice and a coffee shop have a channel, Bob and Joe have a channel, Joe can't buy a coffee just because he and the coffee shop both have "a channel with someone on the network". Bob would need a channel with Alice to bridge the gap between the coffee shop and Joe. So when Joe makes a purchase, his purchase is routed from Joe&gt;Bob&gt;Alice&gt;Coffee shop.
Assuming... of course...the channels between Joe and the Coffee shop have enough funds on "Joe's side of the channel" to purchase the coffee. 
And what if Alice had paid the steep Bitcoin transaction fee to open the channel with the coffee shop and she had initialised the channel with just enough money to purchase 5 lattes.. if Joe purchases a latte and his purchase is routed through Alice, doesn't this use up one of Alice's lattes?
Could Alice rock up to the coffee shop on day 5, attempt to pay, and realize there's no money left on her side of the channel? 
She'd have to micromanaging how much she has left with every retailer she opens a channel with. 
Maybe she just opens a big channel with a major hub, which most retailers are connected to.. No more micromanagement.
So how does a retailer join this hub? My tiny coffee shop wants to join. The hub would have to be the one who opens a channel with my coffee shop and they would have to front hundreds, probably thousands of dollars to make sure the channel has enough money in it to handle hundreds of latte purchases. The channel only runs one way (people buy coffees, and there are no refunds) so eventually the channel will need to close (once all the money has moved over from the hub to the coffee shop). 
Honestly I am worried, lighting sounds awesome on paper but it just sounds like an absolute mess in practice. Hopefully someone can shed some light on these concerns.

Not true. Not just "anyone". There must be a valid route between the person purchasing and the coffee shop. For regular locals, this could be a common occurrence. Joe and Alice frequent the coffee shop, Joe has a channel with the coffee shop, but Alice doesn't. But they both also have their own channels with the local supermarket. So if Alice walks in and wants to buy a coffee, her payment gets routed like so: Alice&gt;SuperMarket&gt;Joe&gt;Coffee Shop.
Doesn't really work for just "anyone" though. Imagine a Traveller on a road trip stopping in your town for a coffee at your Coffee shop. There is a good chance that they are not going to be a part of the communities "web" of lighting channels.

Yes, she still hs the 1 BTC to spend but it in now in the channel between her and Bob. If there is no 'valid' path from Bob to the Coffee Shop (in our example, there isn't), she can't spend that 1 BTC on a coffee. 
Again, worth noting in this example the network is unrealistically tiny, in the most ideal world there would be dozens of routes her channel to bob back to the coffee shop. But we'll never really know until LN gets adopted and we see how people begin to use it.
If it follows a hub and spoke model like a lot of people predict, there might not be such a large 'web' of connections to really allow the LN to shine. Just lots of 'one off' connections to giant hubs.

I'm fairly sure the solution is just more scale. That there should be another valid route for Alice to buy coffee that starts with her
Channel to Bob and eventually works back to the coffee shop.

So, with your example.. you said everyone has 1 BTC on "their side". This means both sides put in 1 BTC to open the channel. Network looks like so: 
[Joe] (1) &lt;---&gt;(1) [Bob] (1)&lt;---&gt;(1) [Alice](1)&lt;---&gt;(0) [Coffee Shop]
* The numbers represents BTC
* Note, Bob and Alice both own 2 BTC in total.
Joe buys an expensive ass coffee for 1 BTC from the coffee shop, he doesn't have a direct link to it. So, lighting network seamlessly routes his payment through everyone until the money hits the coffee shop. Joe pays Bob, Bob pays Alice, Alice pays coffee shop.
The network now looks like this:
[Joe] (0) &lt;---&gt;(2) [Bob] (0)&lt;---&gt;(2) [Alice](0)&lt;---&gt;(1) [Coffee Shop]
* Joe no longer has any money
* Coffee shop has received the money
* Everyone else still has the same amount of money "collectively". (Bob has 2 BTC, Alice has 2 BTC)
* Joe gets his coffee!
Due to the new state of this (unrealistically small) network, no one else can buy a coffee. Alice will be disappointed when she goes to buy one because her money isn't in that channel any more, it's on the channel she has with Bob. She still has the 2 BTC. But that 2 BTC is now in the channel with Bob. And she is the one that spent the bitcoin transaction fee to open the channel with the coffee shop to begin with.
Her options are:
* Open a new channel with the coffee shop, paying the transaction fee again to initialise the channel
* Wait for some purchase to flow through the coffee shop to her, so the 1 BTC ends up back on her side. Say Joe's friend Sam has a channel open with the coffee shop, and he wants to send 1 BTC to Joe. Before sending it, the network would look like so: (continuing from above)
[Joe] (0) &lt;---&gt;(2) [Bob] (0)&lt;---&gt;(2) [Alice](0)&lt;---&gt;(1) [Coffee Shop](0)&lt;---&gt;(1) [Sam]
Sam sends Joe 1 BTC via the lighting network. The network now looks like this:
[Joe] (1) &lt;---&gt;(1) [Bob] (1)&lt;---&gt;(1) [Alice](1)&lt;---&gt;(0) [Coffee Shop](1)&lt;---&gt;(0) [Sam]
*Joe gets his BTC
*Sam no longer has any BTC left
*Everyone else still has the same amount of BTC, but again the money has moved around to different channels
*Now Alice can buy a coffee again
I understand these are just silly little examples, but pretend instead that these channels represented their every day spending accounts or something, and they were load with more money and the coffee shop was a super market instead. Maybe Alice goes out shopping and she wants to spend a few hundred dollars worth of BTC on groceries and such. But as she pushes her trolley to the register, someone decided to splurge on something big elsewhere and the purchase just happened to be routed through Alice. The money she had in the channel linking her to the grocery store has moved to one of her other channels. And what if there is no valid route from the other channel back to the grocery store? Or maybe there is a valid route, but there isn't enough BTC in The channels along that route to fund her purchase? 
I know it sounds like I am approaching this all like it's doomed to fail, but that's not my intention. I'm just trying to get a proper understanding for the limitations of the system. It isn't magic, it's a protocol, and I feel it's important to understand how it works before blindly pushing for adoption like a lot of other users seem to be doing.

Well, money just gets shuffled around. When Joe's latte purchase is routed through you, Alice, you send 1 lattes worth of BTC to the coffee shop, but Bob will send 1 lattes worth of Bitcoin to you. (And Joe will send one lattes worth of BTC to Bob). If you sum up the amount if money you have in all your active channels, you haven't lost anything...but that 1 last latte you were looking to buy, you can't buy any more. The 1 lattes worth of BTC you had in the channel between you and the coffee shop has been shifted to the channel you have with Bob.
Too bad Bob doesn't sell lattes.

What is this website?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:31:44
Maybe a big question but how exactly does the lightning network allow for instantaneous purchases (ie coffee). Isn't it layered on top of Bitcoins protocol? It's not a separate thing right?

I apologise, that was poorly worded I guess. The general vibe I get from this subreddit is to shun Bitcoin cash. How Bitcoin cash is not worth investing in to, how it is not to be taken seriously over Bitcoin. It's also mixed up with a lot of these websites trying to "trick" users in to using Bitcoin cash. So, yeah, all I see are negatives. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:06:51
All I hear is negatives about bitcoins cash. This image shows some really nice positives of Bitcoin cash. Can you guys explain to me why this subreddit hates Bitcoin cash so much? I only hold bitcoins, I have only heard about Bitcoin cash from this subreddit and it's nothing but negative but I still don't know why it's bad.
