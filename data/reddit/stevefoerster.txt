I'm sorry to hear this.  The €1000 KYC requirement should merely be an inconvenience, but a requirement to meet customers in person is completely absurd.

I've long believed that the failure of e-gold due to its centralized nature was a real motivator for SN.

There's a whole branch of economics called [Public Choice]( which details why politicians will always represent themselves over you no matter who is footing the bill.  
The problem isn't the money in politics, the problem is that there is so much centralized political power available for it to buy.

Those of us who were around during the '90s and '00s know that one big reason for decentralization is that it's the only practical alternative to giving government the power to squash you like a bug.

I was there, so I know this is a legitimate concern, and something a lot of us discussed as a threat even at the time.  Those in government can't suppress all individual activity, but they can and often do suppress any activity that they perceive as a threat, and financial innovation is definitely on the short list.  
Anyway, I'm not sure what a pile of pseudo-mystical nonsense about a higher power does to help make the case that government control of financial systems isn't the threat it's already proven itself to be.

Look, I appreciate the potential of Bitcoin too, but gold has been a reliable store of value for something like six thousand years.  By the time Bitcoin has 1% of that track record, I'll be dead of old age.  Perspective matters here.

Thank you.  This point cannot be stressed enough, especially since it's the law enforcement agencies of large countries who have the resources to do this the most easily.  To normal people it may be impenetrable, but to them it's just Sudoku.

I'll take these in reverse order.
Selling: A mortgage requires something like 4% interest per annum. BCH+BTC is offering... well, noticeably better returns than that. If 2018 is only one tenth as good as 2017, it would still be insane not to keep hodling and get that FHA mortgage.
Divorce: IANAL, but if you all were married when you bought in, yes, cryptocurrency would be a marital asset. On the other hand, the very best way to ensure you'll *get* divorced is to hide things like this from your spouse in the first place.
Job: Sometimes, knowing that you don't necessarily have to stick around in an undesired job if you really get fed up makes it easier to tolerate, particularly when you get to look at your seven figure net worth every day.

Just thought that was amusing.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:15:28
I love Bitcoin, but this is the most stupid statistic ever.  The value of all gold in circulation is $7.6 trillion, the value of all Bitcoin in circulation is something like $8 billion.  That's what matters, the unit comparisons here are arbitrary and therefore meaningless.
In other words, when 1 BTC is worth as much as twenty-five 40 oz. bars of gold, *then* they'll have reached parity.  And maybe that will happen.  But not today.
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:10:48
Firstly, I'm not moving the goalposts, I'm just pointing out that what you think is a goalpost really isn't, so you're essentially cheering because your team managed to get the ball to your own twenty yard line.
See, "moving goalposts" refers to when someone states a condition for being wrong, then changes it when that condition is reached. I've never said anything about spot being an unreachable milestone for Bitcoin. On the contrary, I've said that Bitcoin has the potential to reach genuine parity someday. That's praise, so may want to take yes for an answer.
Secondly, scroll up. I actually purposefully didn't use the phrase "marketcap" (wrong phrase anyway, since it's a currency, not a stock issuance).  I referred to total circulation because that's my whole point, that this BTC/XAU comparison is between inherently arbitrary units rather than the systems as a whole.
And like I said, that's not a criticism of Bitcoin, just of this particular comparison. You really don't have to be this defensive.

Before you shake on it, remember that "public school" means different things in different countries.
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:31:29
Jesus, how much unabashed cheerleading do you require? I'm literally praising Bitcoin here, I'm just also saying this particular statistic isn't why it's praiseworthy. Besides, as we're already seeing, Bitcoin doesn't have to be the size of gold to have a serious impact on the way the world sees and uses money. Yay Bitcoin!
By the way, my goal is to call things as I see them, not "spur anyone on" or encourage anyone, because Bitcoin is a financial innovation that lives or dies based solely on how useful it is, not the cult that you seem to think it is.

People who want a commodity that is actually untraceable.
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:32:03
Not at all, in fact this is a very stupid fake rivalry that only serves the interests of the existing fiat financial system. Both gold and bitcoin are great, even more so because they're great for different reasons. So it's not a matter of "moving goalposts", it's just a matter of comparing the two (as much as it even makes sense to do so) on equal terms rather than arbitrary ones.

FFS, just get some Preparation H already.

I'll say this: Bitcoin has a much better chance of increasing in value 1000x than gold does. It more than has already!

At most schools, yes, but he could go to somewhere like [George Mason University]( where the economics faculty members don't all belong in the philosophy and creative writing departments.

Are you only considering doctoral programs in economics, or would you also consider finance?  You may find that the latter is a lot more friendly to what you want to do, and besides, academic jobs are easier to find in finance departments than economics departments.

I'm a maximum strength libertarian, but to be honest I've just never had any worse customer service at the post office than anywhere else. In fact, from experience, I'd rather go to the post office than the local UPS depot.

Neither Bermuda nor Liechtenstein would be ideal for this.  Somewhere like Dominica or Anguilla would probably be better, if the entity was chartered using the right type of incorporation.  It's something I'm still looking into, though.

This is bad, obviously, but there's a difference between there being a bill introduced about something, and US CONGRESS GOING FULL ALL CAPS ON MUH BITCOIN.
So the real question is whether this bit has any actual support among the leadership, and if so whether it's the sort of thing that would survive a conference committee.
