I also predicted the US housing bubble it was really easy for anyone with a little brain and some basic economic sense.
Yes it was a bubble, and it have burst, but not because he was right, but because china made it tough to use bitcoin.

Annoying, they should had been transparent, so they do not block the action.

Ofcourse they are. Or do you claim that stocks are created to go down in value? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:18:25
No, they have up until now been able to exchange their money into bitcoins and withdraw those and sell those at another exchange.

Thats a shortage of only 11.000 btc at a value of $560. Maybe those where the 11.000 btc stolen in the malleability bug. That seems likely. They should be able to recover those pretty quickly. Like in 10-15 days trading or so? At most one or twho months, than they are in the green. 
So it could be very good news for those who trade there.

You are too eager. Mt.Gox have a bigger chance of paying back their customers (you) if they are alive and can collect fees, than if you bring them down.

"I believe that Karpeles, personally or through intermediaries, borrowed up to 600K-750K of coldest-cold storage Bitcoins to Ross Ulbricht to provide black market liquidity."
I don´t get your theory, there is no logic to this. Why would he do that? 
You claim that he would do so to simply get access to fiat, but Ross did not have fiat, if he is the one who managed SR, he conducted the trade in bitcoins.
It would be like giving away your business.
When it would be safer and more profitable to not do so because after all he had the biggest exchange. Where people could simply buy coins and he make a profit on it. 
So I cant see any logic at all for your theory.

You here HODL because people are fighting for the currency to survive.

Compare the price to the adoption. 
One good place is  (it appears to be down right now).
Neo &amp; Bee have done a massive campaign on cyprus for their bitcoin based service. Ofcourse who knows what and if it will have an impact on the price.
If you go in, do it for atleast 6 months, dont panic sell at a loss.

3 seconds for your transaction to be propagate on the network. 10 min for first confirmation. 
For small things, like buying a meal, 99% of the time there is no need for any confirmation. 3 seconds is enough.
For big transactions like paying your rent, sending salary 1 hour is enough.

Want to buy from Amazon, just buy a amazon card from gyft --&gt; and fill your amazon account. Takes 3 seconds.

If thats the case why do we have stocks? They always go up in value, would not people put all their money into stocks and not spend any of them.
You also said that inflation encourages spending. 
Do you think a single person go to a store to spend, thinking. I better spend this money because it will go down in value if I don´t. Maybe in Argentina, with &gt;10% inflation is that good?
What do you think happens if everyone postpone their buying of something? After a while it would be the exact same thing as if no one postpone their buying.

It can´t be a nice article if they take what is a very questionable rumor, being spread from a very questionable document as real fact.

In order to use digital fiat money you have to give your money away to a private company. Think about that. 
Often those are huge companies, this allows them to forever suck from peoples money with fees.
Bitcoin is opensource money that for the first time people can own digital money themselves without paying huge fees. Next update will have even lower fees.
Most banks really don´t like this freedom as they see it as a threat to their source for fees. (But they could start mining.)
Two good easy videos.
