They are based in "Sacremento, California", couldn't even be bothered to spell the city name correctly ( [ and the phone number is from UK. Sadly many people chasing fast money fall for these scams.

thank you for the feedback! I definitely pay attention to it.
the UI is still not final, so the terminology could change.
wrt to using "accounts", I agree that it's not technically correct, though it's easier for users to understand. there's another design where account is completely dropped and only  the icon for each is shown. there's also a plan for an advanced mode where these terms could be more technically accurate.
about the distinction between each, I think they are different enough that having 2 distinct cards for each is fine, especially considering that most UIs people are familiar with today in banking do differentiate between checking/savings accounts (where one is fast, the other is slow). on top of that, there are already wallets which combine both into a single balance (zap or lightning-app comes to mind), so if that's what a user prefers, they do have that option.
though, again nothing here is final, there could be big changes or not.
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:56:28
once it reaches 99% it means it finished syncing with block headers and starts syncing filter headers, so it could take about 5-20 minutes to go from 99 to 100%. there's a fix for it, should be in there next release.
for the UI, it's still an experiment, so we'll see how it develops.
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:44:22
there's one here:

I'm always active on twitter (twitter.com/rawtxapp) and usually post whatever news I have there too.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:46:07
the source code for lnd which we bundle is available, the source code for the UI components/app isn't available for now. it might happen eventually before a mainnet release, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:53:06
lnd was relatively easy to cross-compile, so that's the one I choosed, but I've decided to release the code after an ios app release, so if someone is able to cross compile c-lightning, they could reuse the app and UI.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:39:50
sounds good, will do. let me know what you think! bugs at this point are still very likely, but I will fix them quickly when they come up!
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:47:40
Sure, of course, let me know if you run into any issues.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:29:13
will do a video for each operation you could do with the wallet when it's launched.

there's nothing magical about waiting 10 minutes for a transaction to confirm!

\- yes, only neutrino, not many out there, which is why we are running one.
\- connects to multiple nodes, in addition to the nodes you specify in create wallet card.
I'm not too familiar with neutrino internals yet, so not sure about the last 2 questions, but you could find the answers from lightning labs devs or looking through the code \([
There isn't a wifi only mode right now, when you create a wallet from scratch, from initialization until being completely synced it takes about 250MB of data. After that, it spends a lot of time sharing messages with other lightning nodes, etc, so it's continuously consuming data. We could eventually implement wifi/lte modes, but in the meantime, you have 2 options: close the wallet when switching to LTE or better yet, you can limit apps from using background data \([ and that should make it work.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:06:27
is there a video of the whole discussion ?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:33:51
sounds good, will check it out in the evening.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:56:26
it technically supports mainnet, but we want to wait at least a month after shipping to make sure the app is stable, but if you had a mainnet lnd node running somewhere, you could use the app as a frontend to your node.
data traffic seems to be very little, though would need to measure.
I've been running it for 2 weeks, 24/7 on my phone, didn't notice the battery life being affected at all.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:57:08
a few people have been asking about this as well. while I do want to open\-source it, there are problems of people just copying the app, changing a few lines and pushing scams on unsuspecting users. so if we can make sure that doesn't happen, sure it makes sense to release it. I think the only way we can make that happen is if we put it on the app store first, let users try it out and over time as it gathers reviews, etc, it will be more difficult to confuse this app with another. keep in mind that this is just testnet, so there's really nothing to lose by trying it out... we will see, but I understand your point.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:53:49
yeah, I think he meant it sarcastically :)
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:25:49
I think lightning developers have a few ideas on how they want to do watchtowers, we will see. Though just to be clear, you're not running a full blown node on your client, it's a lightweight neutrino node. I'm not sure about the fees for watchtowers, etc, we will have to see how they develop.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:44:01
yes, the daemon is a short term solution until watchtowers are ready!
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:15:25
I've been working on it for 2-3 months now and it has been usable for the last 2-3 weeks. Not sure about the watchtower timeline, but I believe we should see something over the summer, but core lightning devs would know better.
@_date: 2018-05-02 02:33:11
I saw another guy who said he had a wallet for ios shipping soon, coinclip it was called I think.
our code also runs on ios, but we want to fix bugs on android and make it more stable before focusing on ios. also, if our timing is right, we would ship an ios version right when watchtowers are ready so you could also receive payments even on ios.
@_date: 2018-05-01 22:33:50
it's testnet bitcoin sent through lightning. you need to setup lnd or use the eclair wallet for android for now.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:56:59
I agree, this is just a first step!
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:52:10
yeah, looks like a normal bitcoin wallet. I was hoping for another lightning wallet, though the UI is very slick!
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:17:34
hey I get unable to find destination to path. can you try going under Wallet operations card at the very end, press Show network graph nodes and connect to a bunch of them.
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:24:11
we are going to release our android app in a week or two (twitter.com/rawtxapp if you want updates). the way our code is structured it would run on ios too, but we do some things to allow receiving payments and those wouldnt work on ios for now unfortunately.
I also saw this guy on yalls.org, he said he was working on an ios wallet, I think it was called coinclip.
There's also "balance" wallet on ios that I believe runs lnd under the hood.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:42:57
I'm not aware of it. does it have active discussion ? if yes, how do I join ?
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:56:50
expect to see it this sunday unless I discover a big bug or have problem listing the app store.
it does accept payment.
sounds good, will do.
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:24:36
mostly time and effort for now. it will be easier once I have something stable to open source.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:48:23
and the fact that he called it Bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:01:25
I try to make as simple as possible to use, so it will be useful to everybody!
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:47:47
My 2 cents, I think that while having 1 wallet that fullfills all requirements sounds good in theory, it fails in practice:
\- When everybody owns something, nobody owns it, you end up with tragedy of commons,
\- Who decides which Wallet Improvement Proposal gets in or not ? You end up with politics and stagnation.
\- Competition forces teams to build the best product and at the end of the day, the market decides which product is the best.
I think protocols and end\-user products are very different beasts, it wouldn't make sense to develop multiple "lightning" protocols, just like it wouldn't make sense to develop only a single wallet.
We will see though, maybe I'm wrong, time will tell.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:44:53
thank you, hoping to build the best lightning wallet out there :)
Still thinking about open-source, full open-source might happen before a mainnet release.
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:55:15
I believe lightning will enable atomic exchanges, where you can hold to your funds and exchange them for other assets in an atomic swap.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:22:11
just ignore them. if as a community we spent half of our energy on building tech (that showcases lightning/it's capabilities and showing demos of what's possible to people who have not seen it) instead of arguing with those people, we would be better off.
at the end of the day, the market and people will decide who survives and so far it doesn't look good for them.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:22:43
some of them don't have addresses. if the first nodes in that list don't have any addresses, that means you need to wait a little bit for the network to be fully boostrapped and the first few nodes you'll see in that list will have addresses.
also do you have any channel open with the network ? you need to have a channel open and some positive remote balance on that channel to be able to receive. if you did the "Get started" part the faucet already opened a channel to you, so you should be good to go.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:08:45
I get invoice expired when I try.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:24:14
Wow, this is perfect, this is the kind of detailed feedback I'm looking for!
\- wrt creating new wallet, when you're on testnet, there's an option to just copy the seed \(3rd button\) on the screen where you're supposed to type the seed. For mainnet, I'm not sure if I would add a way of just "sharing" your seed, because someone could potentially go through your emails or messages, etc. Not sure yet.
\- wrt getting started, eventually I'm going to switch over to "simple" and "advanced" modes, when you're in simple mode, we could just say checking/savings and advanced mode would show lightning/onchain balance. Though there's still a lot that needs to be done design wise.
\- wrt syncing stuck, it does happen sometimes, I need to debug it further, but you don't need to kill and restart the whole app, you can scroll to bottom and "Close wallet" and reopen it. I know this is inconvenient, working on determining a fix.
\-wrt to faucet, I agree sometimes it can fail in unpredicted ways and not super intuitive, I don't own/run those servers, but I will look into the code and see if I can submit a fix.
\- wrt to savings \-\&gt; checking transfer, when you were trying to do it, were there already a lot of nodes ? Was the lightning graph node information below had a lot of nodes ? I will look into what could be causing the weird screen.
\- wrt to explorer qr connection, it's possible that graph was still being built. I guess I need to add an extra checks to make sure there's a certain amount of network that was bootstrapped.
\- wrt to connecting to peers and creating channels, can you let the wallet run and try again after a few hours ? It still has bugs and I agree that this is a bad user experience, I have tested all this functionality and they have worked \(maybe like 6\-7 times out of ten\), so I think if you let the network boostrap for a little more, they might just work.
Thanks for the feedback, I really appreciate you taking the time to write it! Obviously this is just v0.1 and I have a lot of work to do to make it to a v1.0 and it will happen thanks to early users and their feedbacks like yours!
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:49:21
cross compiled a very slightly patched version of lnd (essentially just adding hooks into starting and stopping the server), cross compiled into arm and x86 architectures for android.
once you get the library, wrote some code that manages lnd in Android through the hooks I added previously. there are a few tricks to make sure that the native code doesn't crash the app, that you can recover from crashes, that you could output log files into right places, etc. I'll have a technical doc explaining how it works if there are anyone interested in it and will open source the code before a mainnet release.
we receive by making the lnd run 24/7 (without affecting battery) and using the rpc exposed by lnd.
all of this is possible thanks to the amazing work the lightning devs have done on lnd!
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:47:00
I'm hoping this will make lightning much more convenient for a lot of users, can't wait to see all the cool things lightning will enable!
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:59:01
sure, give it a go and let me know what you think!
as a side note, because of the way the app is built, you could easily point it to your own lnd node and use this as a UI for your node and you can run your own lnd mainnet if you want.
I might add the functionality if people are interested.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:51:29
haha, thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:49:25
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Bitcoin had to face much worse actors than very wrong Ver, it will survive this one too and become better for it. I wouldn't call it a civil war though, a civil war implies it's 50/50 split of community, it's probably more like 90/10 and one side is clearly winning.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:57:26
will be open sourced before a mainnet release.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:12:58
Bitcoin blockchain had different wallets, I think having multiple wallets developed makes sense. Some people want advanced wallets, some people want simple wallets, some people like wallets that are designed with cards, some like wallets that are designed differently.
Do we need more than 1 smartphone ? Turns out people like different things.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:50:28
hey, check out the app we are building, it's exactly that, checking account (lightning) + savings account (blockchain).
we are releasing for android now, publicly in a day or 2, but early access here: 
you can see some screenshots/videos on our twitter: twitter.com/rawtxapp
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:23:04
will do, thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:02:16
About the balance of 0 on savings, if you see 0, it means it's working, you will see the correct balance after a while \(I left a note there saying so\), your channel will be open in a bit. It's a known issue, not ideal though, should be fixed soon.
I'm looking into the blank screen problem.
Thank you again!
@_date: 2018-05-10 06:12:14
our code also runs on iOS, we just didn't had time to test it properly, but you should also see our iOS version soon. thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:50:53
if we can get the daemon to be very efficient performance/storage/bandwidth wise, I don't see a reason for not running it 24/7 (I've been running it 24/7 for the last 3-4 weeks, no problem so far).
Though iOS doesn't allow daemons or background tasks unfortunately, so no receiving on mainnet until watchtowers are ready on iOS.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:33:47
yes, lnd stores a bunch of files, we store a wallet.conf which holds information about your wallets (names, which coin, which network) and we use react-native's AsyncStorage to store a boolean when you see the welcome message so that we don't show it again.
Those files are all in the application's folders, never shared.
Eventually, as part of wallet diagnostics, we will write files outside of application directory so that you can access and look through them. On Android, you can't see an application's files unless you're running a debug build or rooted phone. Right now, we show you the last 500lines or so of lnd.logs, but you might want to see the whole thing and then it makes sense to move it outside of the application directory. You should never run this wallet on a rooted phone because other malware apps could access your admin.macaroon file.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:35:40
now we just need more developers building projects on top of lightning and contributing to lightning itself. we need more people writing documentation, etc, so that all these cool things can finally happen!
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:28:47
I know a lot of redditors don't like to visit websites they don't know (in this case [rawtx.com mobile lightning network wallet]( So this is the tl;dr:
Today, we are releasing rawtx, a mobile lightning network wallet for Bitcoin.
For now, it's available on Android, with iOS version coming soon.
You can download it from [Android Play Store](
We have produced 11 short videos (&lt;1 min) showing all the different features on the app, you can
see the playlist on youtube: [
 Features (aka tl;dr)
* You can **send and receive** testnet Bitcoins on blockchain and lightning network.
* Support **multiple wallets**.
    * Each wallet is composed of 2 accounts: **checking account and savings account**.
        * Checking account = **funds on lightning network**, savings account = **funds on blockchain**.
        * This seemed the most intuitive way, because most people understand those concepts
        and understand that transferring funds between savings&lt;-&gt;checking account takes time and some money.
        We are open to other ideas.
    * Only 1 wallet can run at any given time, but we are going to add
    possibility of running multiple wallets at the same time.
* Pay lightning invoices by **QR code or lightning invoice**.
* You can **generate** lightning invoices.
* You can directly get testnet coins from the **faucet**.
* Show **outgoing and incomings payments** on the lightning network.
* Transfer money from *checking account*-&gt;*savings account* by **closing channels**.
* Transfer money from *savings account*-&gt;*checking account* by **creating channels to an existing peer or by QR code**.
* Displays lightning network information (**number of nodes, edges, etc.**).
* Show a **list of nodes** and filter nodes by pubkey or alias.
* **lnd-as-a-service**: runs [lnd]( in the background (can run 24/7 if the wallet is open) and you can
access the instance even outside the app by using the https certs and macaroons which are displayed in **About** screen.
    * The battery usage seemed reasonable in our testings, but this is just a start and it will keep improving.
* Show **lnd logs** for debugging purposes.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:59:17
when watchtowers are ready, unfortunately iOS dev environment is very limited (for example you can't run background processes), so we will release a testnet iOS and wait for watchtowers or find another temporary solution.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:12:19
I have been using it for 2 weeks, it's relatively smooth, but since the protocol itself is still being developed and peers come online then go offline, sometimes payments or opening and closing channels fail.
To make sure that the app is still usable, I try to be as transparent as possible about what happened and how you can move forward in another way (for example, if you have single channel that became inactive, it'll show an error and have a button that says you can create another channel, etc).
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:36:33
I believe there's already zap and lightning-app on desktop.
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:53:09
interesting concept, what's the advantage of having a separate box just for ln ? why not just use computer or smartphones ?
@_date: 2018-05-01 22:32:07
go read the article on yalls.org, you'll know who it is!
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:43:37
I'm thinking of open sourcing it once it's somewhat stable. I will have an announcement in a week or two, explaining how it works, etc. it essentially runs the open source lnd implementation, the wallet itself is a fairly simple UI implemented in react-native. Let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:55:36
yes, I want to make sure there are no bugs in the app, that the app is stable, doesn't consume too much battery, etc. we don't want people to lose funds and blame lightning for it.
mainnet release comes when says neutrino is good to go! until then we have a lot of improvements to do. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:08:48
it'll be on play store soon.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:09:52
lightning is really amazing!
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:35:00
well, technically, the app does support mainnet (lnd does support mainnet without neutrino), but for the time being, that doesn't make too much sense on Android.
if you really want to do the at-your-own-risk and you happen to have a lnd mainnet node running, we can add possibility to point the UI to your node.
if you're really reckless, I could add a hidden way of enabling the mainnet, but it's not going to happen anytime soon unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:21:33
if you wanted, you can point it to an ln node at home, but it also bundles lnd inside it. in this particular demo, I'm using just the app itself with the bundled lnd.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:56:54
Alright, then give it a week or 2 until people try out the app and make sure there's no bugs in the app itself. Then I *might* give some hidden options to enable mainnet, but I don't guarantee anything. I don't want people to lose funds and blame it on lightning, that would set us back!
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:44:17
there are fees for opening and closing channels + routing nodes will also collect fees (much lower than on chain, but still non zero). so you might be able to execute that attack for a while, but you're eventually going to drain your wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:17:19
Yes, it takes about 1 block for the savings balance to be correct and about 2-3 blocks for the pending checking balance to be confirmed. Once it's confirmed, you should be able to spend it.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:29:14
I didn't realize people used invoices without amounts for donations, I force an amount at the UI layer, but since this is a use\-case, I will stop forcing it. You should see an update this evening.
You can report issues directly to me, or on this github repo: [
Thanks! Let me know when your channels are open and the network is bootstrapped, I will pay the invoice :\)
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:02:53
it took some time to figure out how to run lnd on Android, but once I figured it out, I was able to run it with minimal modification, so lnd by itself is very well done and can "just" run on low resources already. just needed to be cross compiled.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:39:43
There's nothing that puts a limit on a lightning transaction.
I'd say, at this current stage of LN(April 2018), I wouldn't use it for more than 20$ real money because it's still in development.
But once it's stable, I'd say LN is for everything &lt;10k$ and anything &gt;10k$ would happen on the blockchain.
I also suspect that for majority of users, most of their balance will always live on the lightning network. For example, you would be interacting with an exchange that runs lightning, you buy bitcoins through that exchange and it's sent directly on the network to your wallet that also supports ln, you would rarely interact with the blockchain unless very big amounts or specific purpose (the same way with the internet today, you don't need to worry about TCP connections, most users just see/care about the http part of the stack).
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:33:49
yes, as a matter of fact, we've cross compiled the whole lnd (which includes neutrino) into iOS, you can download it from app store (rawtx.com for links). there's still a lot of work we need to do, but it works.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:00:24
I came here about a month ago to announce the Android of this wallet, now it's on iOS and the code is open\-sourced.
You can get the Android version: [
the iOS version: [
or build it from source: [
Here's a video of sending 20 satoshis from Android to iOS: [ (keep in mind that receiving on mobile phones requires watchtowers, but in this case I still included because it's good to try it out and it's testnet, so the coins are worthless).
Edit: it's testnet for now until it's properly optimized and bugs have been ironed out, etc.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:12:37
thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:22:36
because mainnet on mobile is not ready yet. I'm working on adding possibility to connect to remote lnd nodes, with that, merchants could run their remote lnd node with mainnet and receive for now.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:50:33
yes, one of the todos as I mentioned on GitHub is to have a simple/advanced mode. for now, most people trying out lightning are fairly technical users and lightning is still under development, so this is okay, for example a normal user wouldn't need to know about block syncing or channels etc, but with this UI, it helps for debugging as well.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:20:57
yes, you can receive, though it is not safe because counterparty could broadcast previous state. since it's testnet and the coins are worthless, I included the functionality, for mainnet receiving, we would need watchtowers.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:57:18
you mean when running your own lnd on a computer ? that feature should be ready soon.
just to be clear, with this app, you are running your own node on the phone directly. it's not connected to a remote node or anything.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:37:53
yes, only testnet for now, looks like I can't change the title. main\-net as soon as it's ready.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:18:56
on iOS we can't run the app in the background unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:32:31
hey that's the wallet that I'm building. it's only for testnet for now though, but you can still give it a try. Anton's wallet is for mainnet I believe.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:37:31
Android or iOS ?
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:39:23
awesome! I'm going to write a more detailed overview of how things are organized.

yes, it is running neutrino. it should be relatively easy to either connect to a remote lnd node or modify lnd.conf on the phone to point to a remote btcd or bitcoind.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:51:12
I strongly believe lightning is what's going to make Bitcoin the currency of the internet. I would say eventually those people will see the potential, so don't worry too much about them :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:28:33
I'm glad you like, you can create feedback directly on the github repo.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:57:20
that's is true, at some point I considered making self_delay longer and sending a notification to open the wallet like every day it so if the user every received a payment.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:48:28
watch towers are not ready yet, I'll integrate it as soon as they are.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:20:02
that feature is coming soon, it's relatively easy to implement.
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:42:37
it actually doesn't take an hour, if you want try out the wallet Ive been building based on lnd and neutrino, it takes about 15-30 minutes and it's going to get much better+on Android you can let it sync in the background.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:38:37
I'm working on making the sync process much faster, also while Apple doesn't allow running a process in the background, they do allow downloading stuff in the background, but some of the lightning code would have to be written in objC for that.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:52:30
I believe it is intuitive because most people are familiar with those concepts and understand that checking account can be used easily and that transferring funds between checking and savings account take some time and cost some money.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:19:40
it's possible sometimes, I'm working on identifying root causes and fixing them.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:23:54
for the time being, most people trying this app will be technical users, so it's expected that they understand these terms, and since there's a lot work to be done and bugs come up, it's useful displaying all the extra information for debugging (ex: which block height is it on, etc).
for the seed, I'm considering adding an option to remember it, similar to password remembering.
eventually as the network and software gets better, expect most of these things to be hidden behind an"advanced mode" in the wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:42:07
on iOS, we have to share the app process with lnd process so crashes are more likely. I'm working on identifying root causes and fixing them, hopefully they should all be fixed soon.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:35:23
you can visit our page:  it's only for Android and testnet for now, the source code and the iOS app is coming in like a week or two, just waiting to go through Apple's release review process.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:19:54
as soon as it's ready!
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:34:47
fyi, we built a wallet that's running lnd in the background on Android essentially keeping your node up, that would be useful until watchtowers are released. though there are still a lot of improvements that need to be done.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:05:10
do you see a "lightning syncing" message at the top ? if yes, it might be better to wait for it to turn green and it would work better.
another option is to receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain into your savings account, then you can create a channel with a peer (I usually test new wallets by creating a channel to yalls.org).
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:51:39
no mention of satoshis.place ?
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:46:06
yep, I think there are different schemes that we could try.
+1 on adless web design
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:29:17
that wouldn't work, because you can send and receive over a channel at most the amount that was used to fund it. but it's possible the other party will fund the channel and you won't have to. it will be interesting to see how the network develops.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:44:37
who would then fund publishers and creators ?
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:15:17
I think he means "no funds channel".
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:55:44
I have been using lightning for the last 2 weeks, it's truly amazing! so much potential.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:58:59
in the new app I'm developing for lightning, I tried abstracting away by using "checking account" (balance in channels on ln) vs "savings account" (balance on blockchain). I think most people understand those concepts and they also know that moving money between checking and savings account can take time and cost a little bit.
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:08:41
I think a ln wallet should be very intuitive, but not too overly simplistic. For example, I should be able to pay an invoice with a click, but also control which channels I want to close or control the distribution of my funds across ln and blockchain.
I actually already built a ui that I believe to be very intuitive (I have screenshot on my twitter, not sure if I can post a link, but its the same username as on reddit).
I calculate both balances and present them to you. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:23:26
yes, I'm developing an lightning wallet app and this has been one of the pain points when I'm using it, having to pull up my phone to scan qr codes just to pay a single cent isn't user friendly.
I have a few thoughts on how to make micropayments much more convenient, for example when you visit a website that supports it, you can say I'll allow this site to take up to 10$ per month and connect it to your wallet, then you don't have to worry about pulling up the phone all the time.
there are some design decisions but this will be my focus after getting to wallet to a stable state.
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:04:29
"streaming money" has a nice ring to it!
I haven't started work on the micropayments yet, will let you know when I do (after the wallet is released, etc)
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:26:02
we actually got receiving working and found a solution to receiving on mobile until watchtowers are ready, we'll be releasing the beta in a week or 2.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:53:07
great work! we need more lightning projects!
why do you need to whole blockchain? if you're on testnet, you can just use neutrino, synces under 10 mins.
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:16:02
do they really think they are going to increase adoption by confusing users ?
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:02:52
if everbody paid 1sat for each website they visit instead of ads, things could get very interesting!
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:06:26
same here, I was very confused first time I saw it and almost deleted it.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:41:35
from what I understand, it makes the logic behind it easier.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:01:18
Yes, as mentioned previously, will support it once it has concept of allowance and can be made to work in the context of mobile.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:59:21
Yes, although webln works in the context of a desktop browser and it doesn't have the concept of allowance yet. Once those are fixed, I'll support webln.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:07:11
Yep, my thoughts exactly. LN seems to be perfect for micropayments, but the current workflow of copy-pasting payment requests into the wallets creates lots of friction.
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:31:24
Yes, the lapps json is served directly from Github pages.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:11:35
Yes, and the amounts are so low that hopefully users would be willing to spend it on lightning apps. We’ll see how it goes.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:00:36
That would be awesome! Just send a pull request on GitHub to include it in this file: 
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:08:40
Thanks for the feedback! This wallet supports Bitcoins on-chain and lightning layer. It’s to provide a way for users to see their different balances across each.
It’s going away in the next version of the wallet to make the UI even simpler, stay tuned!
