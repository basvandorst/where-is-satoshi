Have to agree with the above. Imo it should be removed as it is only used by whiners, and to the casual visitor looks ... Well, bad on the rest of the community. Half the people whom use it would probably fit right in within . I'm open to positive discussion, but that reddit serves no purpose for this, it only serves as a circle jerk to the butthurt.
I would suggest u stop going there - as already pointed out by posting there you encourage its continued existence. By stopping, I'm sure it would shrink into oblivion when no-one of any importance is listening. You would also save some grey hairs due to continued trolling by it's current residents.

i use it a bit (although many here dislike them, for fair-enough reasons if you look at them historically).
debit card still has a delay. i think the difference is the rate: you get at whatever the rate is, plus the 2% (or whatever), at the time u press submit, whereas with transfer u get the rate when the funds finally clear, which is usually a day-or-2 later, without their 2% markup

this response is typed whilst wearing my tinfoil hat (with 2 rubber bands to prevent a single point of failure - paranoia mode enabled):
* first, i'd perform  a "scan" of your regular haunts (would be advisable)  - if they have done ur car, no telling if any other "surprise packages" have been "inserted" into your home without your knowledge. if you find any more, the need for a Faraday cage to silence them would be a good measure. check any power adapters you may have: i have seen videos of listening devices being placed in powerline adapters which can be "dialed into/auto dial out" for the purposes of eaves-dropping.
example 1:  [
example 2:  [
these are both UK devices (i'm UK resident), but i'm sure you get the idea. you might want to look into something like this for that purpose:  [  if you do start scanning, do it regularly (every couple of days, maybe more: depends how paranoid you feel) because there's no telling if the device may be switched off on your initial scan.
* secondly, if I were you and as you state you have not done anything wrong, i'd lawyer up and confront the authoritys about it - not releasing the hardware of course. As you are Canadian you have a better chance than some western country's of getting to the bottom of, if not who, but also maybe why you are being monitored
* third, if the option above doesn't get anywhere, maybe the press would help - they love scandals of people being bugged illegally (again, as you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide, right?)
**before you do any of the above however, secure ur btc so "they" cant confiscate them, should things go sideways.**
... the above would be my plan of action anyway ... best of luck to you.

they'd be better off hiring more support staff and solving current issues/backlog than hiring a mouthpiece to say "were sorry and are working on it" to the masses via twitter. 
edit: if i had funds waiting/disappeared (as seems to be the case with most issues i read here - and no, i never have, nor will given the current status of what i see, use any coinbase services), the last thing i want to hear is some random comment on twittter addressing everyone GENERALLY, i'd rather have a single person address my specific concern DIRECTLY - like the person looking into/solving my issue.

true, if using them "hard" without cooling and/or heatsink. no issues when not pushing them hard i.e. on desktop playing minesweeper, or using simple light apps.


whilst raspbain does not have a 64bit distro (and i wish it did), there are 64 bit distros for the pi. i currently use a build of gentoo on my pi3s which is 64bit  (unfortunately it's not pi4 suitable yet, but it's being worked on.)

to be honest, i can think of only 1 use-case for 2GB blocks currently given it's perceived volume: adding messages or data to a tx. for me a message of "CSW is a fraud" repeatedly for approx 1.9G could be and interesting find, maybe adding some choice video clips raw format into the tx too.

@_date: 2017-12-15 12:38:23
that site currently shows as down, however if it's the site i think it is (edit: it is, ty google cache), it does NOT list all keys: it calculates a few few keys arround the key you entered (numerically speaking). you are not looking at a flat list, you are looking at on-the-fly calcs based on the key/page you enter, +/- a few keys either side. 
from their FAQ (again, ty google cache):
Q: How does this work?
A: Private keys are a number. 
   Private keys can be very large numbers.
   Private keys can be very small numbers.
   A private key with the value   0 would generate the address: 16QaFeudRUt8NYy2yzjm3BMvG4xBbAsBFM
   A private key with the value   1 would generate the address: 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm
   A private key with the value   2 would generate the address: 1LagHJk2FyCV2VzrNHVqg3gYG4TSYwDV4m
   A private key with the value 127 would generate the address: 1FB8cZijTpRQp3HX8AEkNuQJBqApqfTcX7
   For every page requested, 128 keys are generated.
   For page 1, private keys with the value   0 to 127 are generated.
   For page 2, private keys with the value 128 to 255 are generated.
   For page 3, private keys with the value 256 to 383 are generated.
   For page P, private keys with the value (P-1) * 128 to (P-1) * 128 + 127 are generated.
Q: So you don't store a database of every single key?
A: No.
Q: All keys are generated on the fly, based upon the page number?
A: Yes.

whilst i no longer use a pi3 for a node (moved to odroid hc1 with 1TB disk), it is definatley do-able - i did this myself (but i didnt like the way things were connected, hence moved to the hc1). i did it with a vanilla install of raspbian then "threw on" core, thats it. today i do the same, but starting from an armbian build instead.
in terms of software, once it's up and running it has almost 0 upkeep: i check up on it a few times but never see anything wrong. ofcourse, every update should be applied and thats really the only maintenance i perform i my node: BTC core and OS updates
if you do go using a pi for a node and homebrew it yourself like me, note the location of your swap: get it OFF the sd card and either into a file on the hdd, or use a dedicated swap partition - the performance impact of on-SD swap is massive - to the point it cripples the performance. see this old thread of mine for details where i figured this one out:  [ 
today, i would advise a pi4 not 3 - not just cos of the more memory you can get, but also improved networking and also USB3 - ofcourse go for the full 4G memory: cannot hurt :)
as for running other stuff on it in parallel, during the IBD it will be slow, as the cpu has 10+ years of data to verify in the sync, but once it's caught up should be more usable.

it's not always about payment:
some of us run one as part of a business: an economic node for their company to use
some of us run it as a hobby: for the shits
some of us feel we should given the massive (on paper) gains we may have: a way to say thankyou
some of us run it because if/when we want to use bitcoin, we would rather broadcast/recv thru our own nodes than trust other peoples as the initial point of transmission : dont trust, verify
some of us run a node to ensure bad actors (S2X is a prime example) don't try to force their way in: policing the network 
in short, there are many reasons to run a node, but as you pointed out currently financial reward is NOT one of them.

yes and no: it lists keys based on calculating the page number entered, but it doesnt list keys based on a lookup table it may have previously compiled/gathered (which we know would be so large it would be almost inconceivable). 
i guess it depends on how you see it - a perspective thing. for me it's not a list, just a number generator based on page number input.

for me moon is subjective. i have 2 thoughts on this:
 


for example, those that got onboard before 1BTC was worth anything, to see it reach $30 (so, thinking initial price was 0) that's an infinite gain. those that got on-board at $30 might see $2000 as moon (x66).
i think most people are in the above camp - X times their initial investment, or a certain monetary threshold


today only a handful of places accept it. is moon when 50% of merchants world wide accept it? 75%? 90%? when banks use it? or is it when ur local off-license will accept it? 
some people will see "moon" as usability/functionality, not purely value driven (but many would argue the former drives the latter - a fair point in my book).

depends on your tastes, but i went with a 1TB laptop drive and a usb3-2-sata adapter (so power is drawn from USB ports on the pi -  rather than USB flash: if u use a proper 2.5A psu to power the PI you'll have no issues, and 1TB should last "a while" :) i also found a slight sync speed increase with moving the swap off the sd card to a dedicated swap partition on the HD: see 
edit: if you go this route DO NOT use a 3.5 HDD : pi will not power that without brownouts. it's obvious, but i didnt add it before, so adding it now :)

i had the same issue Thursday last week from paying in GBP and withdrawing BTC (and like u, having done this many times in the past without incident): once GBP had arrived (after a day, which imo is a bit lame as it was a swift bank-2-bank transfer) i submitted a BTC withdrawl, like usual. The email saying the submission had been sent was received almost immediately (like always), however the BTC transfer didn't actually happen until exactly 2 hours later. 
I emailed support the at the '30 minute mark, and things seemed to move "on their own" after the 2 hour mark ( and support had not contacted me or apparently done anything that i could see, no update to the ticket: nada). 
hopefully ur support ticket will be actioned asap (you did raise ur support request against that transfer right?), but like you (and now seeing this as incident no.2) my faith in them has been shaken. I've since had an email "How would you rate the support you received" relating to my case, i'm holding back answering that one just yet.
please be sure to post a reply here once your funds clear: would like to know the scale of the delay.

although i don't know much about this, if it's just reaching out to a known IP or hostname, surely someone can put something on a machine inbetween to catch this: say a raspi with 2 network interfaces (1 to the miner, one to the owners LAN), to translate/imitate antpool and thus redirect the mining to a pool of the hardware owners choice?

You mention u got ur isp to open 8333 - do you mean forward the port from ur router to the ip of ur node? Check ur router is forwarding tcp 8333 to ur node. 
The bitnodes site is the best way to check connectivity, like ur have already tried, but note it only allows a couple of tests per day.

edit: also moved the root fs to a partition on the HDD too, so sd is only read on bootup

i believe each "cruncher" in a pool/organisation is given a range of say 10000 values to try (some arbitrary number - something that would take the cruncher a while to complete), with a central server handing out which ranges each cruncher would work on - it's keeping tabs on which cruncher is working on which range (so as to not duplicate effort within the pool), and ofcourse waiting for one cruncher to indicate a successful solution has been found - which it signals back to the network (and of course claims the block reward for the pool)

i think there's confusion here (or i'm reading your reply wrong).
it took me 3/4 of a month to sync-complete which was  not 3/4 of a month to get to X height. 
i mean by my previous statement i completed 8-days earlier than their imaginary "takes a month to sync" statement. 8 days remaining outta 30-odd: i'll round that to a 1/4 .. ish :)
i will admit, i used their guide in part with my own knowledge to build my own node (my change was to move the swap off SD card and onto the HDD - from complete swap file removal to dedicated 4G swap partition - which was surprising how much effect that had - that may be where i gained my 8 days!) - i just saw red with the "will cause the bitcoin software to crash many times" statement  - i'm still calling bullshit on that one :)

HDD : the bigger the better. i'm running a 1TB laptop HDD (mechanical)  . 100G is not sufficient as we have passed that barrier now.
Power : make sure to get a "proper" 2.5A 5V psu, else u may run into issues. 
linkage to HDD : i'm using one of these: . if u are using a decent enough PSU (see above), you should have no issues.
software: default raspbian image from the site, and core 13.x
I also recommend a case and heatsinks: 
case :  (so you can "put" the HDD somewhere - although some electical tape is needed since there are no mount points for the HDD)
heatsinks: whist not really necessary for usual usage, the sync will take weeks running at 75-100% loading - the cpu will get toasty, so get some sinks so the cpu doesn't throttle. random amazon or ebay those (i used some ram sinks from maplin which i cut down)
also, some reading material from me on swap files vs swap partition on the HDD:

sw is now locked in - criteria reached about 2000 blocks ago. As a result, you dont need to continue signalling any more - everyone agreed hence "locked in". Slush have simply stopped signalling for something that has already been agreed to activate - freeing up the flag used to signal sw for reuse in any new future deployment where flags are to be used again. The "2" is simply bit 1 being set, slush have stopped as there is now no point in continuing signalling something that gonna happen.

essentially, when the fork occurred we have now 2 chains: each has differing rules from the point the fork happened (in this case, block size was what split them) so the chains differ from that block onwards going forwards, but both also have a common transaction history - the chain prior to split occurring. if you had the keys to coins at the time of the spit, you now have keys to the same amount of coins on both chains. 
so, example, if you had 1 BTC pre split for which you had the keys (hardware or paper wallet, on an exchange doesn't count!), you now 1 BTC and 1 BCH. on both chains they have the same private key and same public address.
because of the split, now transactions are not reflected on both chains, so you can move from the coins on chain A to one address, and from chain B to a different address - using different wallets for control of coins being held under each chain.
you dont have to move anything - there is no danger of loosing any coins because of the split if you plan to not move anything, just remember that the keys you now have control an equal amount of coin on both chains. however if you think one chain is gonna die off, you can move coins on that chain to an exchange and trade for the other (btc &gt;&gt; bch, or bch &gt;&gt; btc).

my 2 cents:
1 - i haven't even visited the site or googled it: it sounds like a scam. seen a few sites like this in the past which promise this, they operate by making loans to other people, and alleged using the interest from that. sounds too fishy to be true, and some of these in the past were outright scams.
2 - you'd prolly gain more in "interest" (thinking of exchange rate vs fiat) with just hodling - if that's your objective with bitcoin
so, is it worth it? the only advice to give regarding your bitcoin is this - remember the golden rule: if you have the keys its your bitcoin, if someone else has them it isn't yours. if you send them to a 3rd party, whatever they are/do/say, you are relinquishing control. i'd steer clear.

as i understand it, yes, it's entirely possible to sync from machine A and copy the files to machine B - and this will probably be much quicker when u think about the compute power of a Pi (any variant) to that of an i7 (i have never attempted this). 
i'm not sure if OS used matters (i.e. windows sync copied to linux) - perhaps someone who has done this could chime in here (thinking about things like how windows vs linux denote "new line" in text files, for example - not sure if that would be a factor)
however, my life is all about pushing boulders up hill, therefore i let my pi do all the hard work - from zero to hero :)

@_date: 2017-08-25 19:55:02
whats to stop a miner creating a few transactions to use in their own block and no other transactions. that would negate the change you suggest.
would be nice, i agree, but inst possible/do-able. also, as noted, the mempool on each node is different, dependant on which transactions it has "witnessed"/been relayed via other connected nodes.

it runs fine so long as it has decent swap space. i found that moving the swap from a file on the SD card to dedicated swap partition on the HDD improved performance massively (although i may have over-done it on the size: i went with a 4G partition) - it just made the whole system a bit more responsive.

+1 with using this site (it's what i use).
my approach: download the zip (link is at bottom right, points to a git repo) then copy the zip to a USB stick for air-gapped transfer to your "wallet machine". extract and run the HTML from there. 
NEVER use online version of the site for "real" wallets.
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:51:22


nah, at the end of the day the HTML generates the random number on your machine, so the site doesnt "watch" the numbers you generate for your wallet - it's all local at ur end, so there should be no safety concerns on that front (caveat: assuming the site is publishing "good" code. downloading and manually reviewing is always advisable if amounts are 'large'), however the question you should ask is "is the machine i'm viewing this website from compromised at all?". "do you know the browser is safe?"
ok, that's a little bit paranoid, but my comment "NEVER use online version of the site for "real" wallets" addresses that concern.
my stance: better to be safe than sorry. use an air gap - don't assume anything. malware is getting far too fkn clever.

i bet it goes in the hyperloop ...
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:05:15
Im sorry to say the answer to this is yes, no, and maybe :)
a power failure will leave the machine in an unknown condition: 
- maybe all the blocks synced so far had been committed to disk, therefore we only lost what was in RAM, therefore we would be fine. 
- maybe we had half written a block, so it's invalid (but the filesystem is still "clean"). my understanding is that core would roll back this block (maybe a few more) and resume from that point - so we lost a bit of data, but core would rebuild ontop of what we had partially (partially being a subjective term here - we may only lose 1% of the blocks already synced, maybe less)
- maybe we had corrupted the storage where the BC was being stored due to an incomplete write: that *could* be a "start afresh" issue - again it depends how much data was lost (this is where use of ext2, ext3 and ext4 as the file-system come in to play regarding data recovery with fsck) 
so, a power cut is an unknown variable - it is purely down to what was being done at the exact millisecond the juice was lost.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:20:50
as i understand it, companys will be ether one one side of the fork, or the other, with exchanges (maybe) dealing between the 2 allowing trade between them, but at the point of the split they become 2 different entitys, so "compatibility" will be none. my thoughts are the 2x side is doomed, so my only words on that are "best of luck, thanks for all the fish".
Like bitcoin cash, people who had coins at the time of the split (caveat: holding the keys to those coins, not just leaving them on an exchange) will have coins on both sides, so there is a possibility of being able to profit (sell from one fork to buy on the other), however as already mentioned there is an issue regarding replay protection which bcash had but 2x doesnt (where a tx on one side is repeated on the other, which isnt good news) so i'd hold off moving anything until the dust has settled somewhat (i mean after the spilt, we are "safe" for now)  and a proper procedure to dump coins from whichever side you chose is published.


true, there is the potential for alot of disruption, however whilst alot of companys apparently signed some back-room agreement, not all of them did, and there's nothing stopping defections - i doubt the agreement was legally binding. i guess it comes down to what the people want. if it's clear one side or other is prefered then the result is obvious, but if it's a 50/50 affair i could get real messy.
your choice is just that, yours, i have shown my bias in this so wont lie and tell you what i'm hoping for is "neutral".

it's not version 2. the "2x" isn't an incremental version. the 2 means "2M instead of 1M", the X ... well, just to make it look good i guess (or maybe that's "2 times"). the real fact here is it's a different dev team, nothing to do with the "core" team. 
given the core team were not even invited to this "super secret closed room meeting" where segwit2x emerged (or, they were, then dis-invited) should tell you something. 
the fact that this was a closed room meeting doesn't imply "open" or "decentralised" to me. sounds more like a cartel meeting. uninviting only raises suspicions more. there's more to this if you dig deeper.
my conclusion (and that of many others): this is actually an attempt to hijack the development of bitcoin, by trying to replace the lead team and the reference client under the disguise of the scaling debate. it's being sold as a compromise, but it isn't that. segwit2x is nothing more than a Trojan horse attack.

wrong. it can be implemented with EITHER segwit OR segwit2x. it's the segwit part in both that lightning wants (technically LN can be done without either, but it's not very efficient - and makes things **alot** more complicated, so i'm glossing over that for simplicity's sake)


the only difference between segwit and segwit2x (that alot of people will see) is a hardfork to 2M block size (thats what the "2x" bit means) from the current 1M. thinking about SW specifically, currently 1M block could give us much as 4M payload (MAX), segwit2x with 2M blocks could make 8M payload (MAX). 
the functionality that LN wants will be active in a few days on BTC (segwit) - so LN 'could' be active in few days if it were ready to go live - but it isnt, and segwit2x is a planned hardfork of what BTC has now, including the segwit functionality, but with 2M instead of 1M blocks, targeted to fork for around Nov 1st. 
i dont support it because once SW is active i dont think we'll need 2M blocks, it can lead to node centralisation, plus there are other optimisations to do first and lastly i trust the current devs vs. the new guys.

final update (as i cant be arsed to keep updating this thread), after about 5 days (again, logging this for random googlers to stumble onto)
had a few reboots and a bit of network outage, but have just crossed the 380K barrier. again, it took me 16 days to get close to this using SD card swap space. off-sd swap is the way to go (from my experience).
loading averages are still in 3.2 range. i guess after sync this will drop as it will not be constantly busy. temps as a result are in the 60 range, but take into account i do have heatsinks on, no direct airflow, but a reasonably cool room.
cli commands have started to "hang" again: i'm guessing this is a result of the loading, as i had the same issues using SD swap - so swap unaffected (i guess it's a bottleneck of the cpu). somes times commands are instant, sometimes reporting after 30 seconds or so - ymmv.

dont confuse segwit with segwit2x - aka frakensegwit (frankencoin, i think thats what we should call it).
currently, the BTC chain is in the process of activating segwit, that's about a week away (maybe less, not monitoring it) - but it's a done deal because all the signalling has been completed. bitcoin cash split before that, as they didnt want segwit. that was split no.1
segwit, either form, does allow the smaller footprint tranasctions to reduce costs and fit more into a block increasing effective thru-put, this is true. segwit also opens the door for things like LN due to malleability fixes.
segwit2x is another group of miners whom want to take the current segwit which will be activated by that time PLUS add in a 2M hardfork - this is split no2.  sometime in november (1st?) they will fork, so they have segwit plus 2M, whereas everyone else will stay on the 1M segwit chain. 
will it fail like bitcoin cash? i think so (and before the diehards from "next door" come in and downvote, my response to the claim it isnt failing is "bite me"). for me it comes down to trusting who's writing the code for the node software ppl are using. i'm quite happy running core and agree with their roadmap on what's being worked on. their testing is quite thorough (cough BU cough). not sure i trust an entirely new team writing software for something as valuable as btc - esp when their repo seems to be quiet. the whole thing, like bitcoin cash, feels rushed.

as i am now, there should be zero writing on the SD card: 4G swap on HDD and primary storage also on the HDD. loading averages are also down, so all is good. had a bit of fun with "systemctl" but i've figured that one out now - reboots auto stop and start bitcoind as it should.


not sure if i'm reading this right, but the pi only has 1G, but it has 4G as the swap "pool". i haven't messed with the dbcache settings just yet, i'll leave that as is for now, as it's working pretty well currently (@ 263K now). getting late here, might play with that tomorrow.

personally, i would move away from the swap file on the sd card (it's slow, and may start to "wear the card down"). i went with using a dedicated swap partiton instead: see  - I found a large initial performance increase by doing this (at the cost of a little HDD space) - ymmv.

technically, any slab of metal will help. i've seen a vid where a flat 1mm think shim was attached (1x12x12mm iirc) only - no fins or anything, just flat metal, and that knocked off 7 degrees! i butchered some ram sinks from maplin for the cause (UK based): 
that' s a pack of 8, and come pre-thermal-taped. I chopped up 2 into pieces - 2 x 6-fin + 2 x 4-fin bits (image shows 12 fins, mine are 10), then
* the 2 6-fins go onto the cpu, side by side. covers the entire cpu
* 1 4-fin on the eth/usb controller
* 1 4-fin on the ram on rear of card (yes, overkill, but it was "spare", and i could fit it. doesn't hurt anything)
... and i have 6 sinks left, for another 3 pi's potentially. ebay or amazon may find more luck with "dedicated" sinks, but this was a rush job, and is working without incident.
my pi3, under a load of 3.3-odd, sits at roughly 60C - no direct airflow, but the room it is in is cool. after sync i expect the loading (and so temps) to drop dramatically.

ive been syncing for the last 8 days now and will cross the 400K barrier tonight hopefully. i guess another week for the last 40K blocks.

mining will be no harder than the difficulty dictates at the halving, REWARD for that mining is halved.
however, if miners drop off cos the reward is too low vs their costs, then there may be a bump in overall thruput in terms of blocks being mined against the 10 minute average until the next difficulty adjustment.

it's not an if, but a when

yep, it sure does, however the pi does seem a bit more "perky" once i moved the swap over: bitcoin-cli no longer hangs for 30 seconds, and so far i'm upto 258K in 3.5 hours - yes it's gonna take time, but i think the moving swap to HDD is something that many overlook - if what i'm doing in accurate, it has surprised me. it isnt using much, maybe a 50M, but i think it is making a difference
i have also noticed the system loading averages drop from 2.1 to about 1.7 as reported in top, so perhaps there's a driver issue going on in the background too (or simply, SD's are shit!)
either way, i think i'm on a better path now.

i would hardly call it "topped out" after only 3 weeks. 
while it has reached a plateau in acceptanc, you have to give it time for the other miners to fully test/validate and then deploy segwit on their end - which they will only do when they are happy. testing takes a while which is why segwit has a year timelimit - enough time for all miners to make their own judged decisions.
they may want it. they may not. but 3 weeks is hardly enough time to state segwit has "topped out".

Well over? with my Pi3 using an external HDD, sync time was 22 days to get to 445K (the height at the time my sync completed) - and that was 23 days ago so it shouldn't take that long for the remaining months data at this point in time. sure, it's the fat end of a month to sync (3/4), but i feel some scaremongering here because -


I'm calling *bullshit* with that statement, flat out, i had NO ISSUES whatsoever regarding ANY crashes - built from source and synced from scratch. 
With a decent PSU, SD card and external HDD any competent linux user, or person willing to learn linux, will not have any "client-causes-crashes" problems.
/rant over
additional edit (re-rant): if the Pi3 did cause ANY crashes, i would not recommend using a Pi3 for a node at-all - self built or custom image provided by a 3rd party which i cannot vet for issues/malware/whatever

an update for anyone who finds this thread.
it's about 22 hours since the "fixed it" note, and i'm upto almost 330K. using swap on the SD card it took me 8 days to reach 340K - i'm 10K away from that, but given this is sync from zero - an apples to apples test as i see it - that on it's own speaks volumes.
whilst there is still some activity on the SD card (such as logs and other "normal" background tasks) moving the swap away from SD is a huge benefit. huge. i cant state that enough!
other notes:
* i mentioned the load averages had dropped from 2.1 to 1.7. as indicated by (ty for the pointer), syncing has slowed down since about the 240K mark, due to the checkpointing which he pointed out. the load averages are now up: 3.3. whilst this is "heavy", it has to be good: it means the cpu is busy and is not being slowed down (caveat: probably needs the words "as much" here) waiting for storage to keep up.
* memory usage as i type this is 950M used, 134M swap (so thats well over the 1G barrier). not sure how much of that swap is "moving" in and out of ram to execute, but having no swap at all would defo bring the pi down. 4G as noted by myself is probably excessive, and you may get away with 2G or even 1G, however 4G gives it room to breathe, should it need to in future. again i quote   "when u need it, and don't have it, you sing a different tune" 
* as a consequence of the increased load, cpu temp reports 61C. was in the mid 40's. my pi has heatsinks on, and is in a relatively cool room (but little direct airflow). highly advised to add heatsinks on for the initial sync, loading will probably drop once the sync is done, therefore temps should also drop.
* connections sitting at a SOLID 28 now as reported by bitcoin-cli.
havent played with dbcache settings yet, but i think i probably wont have to :) i'll update here again tomorrow: lets see how quickly this will complete now.

i do, and have been for the last 5 (i think) years now. Whilst i perform no transactions using it currently:
* i keep it running so when i do perform any transactions it's there ready to go
* i keep it running to help out the network out (in terms of others syncing to me, and for broadcast of transactions between peers). i know there is an argument that non-transacting nodes can be seen as a burden to the network, but i dont see it that way - i see it as i'm helping gate-keep the rules.
* i keep it running as a way of saying (a very big) thank you for the gain in sheeple money i have \_potentially\_ made should i feel the need to cash out at some point. yes i know some people are in it just for the tech, and some for the money: to be honest, i'm a bit of both.
I do throttle it over certain points in the day so as to not affect my gaming (my node is behind a pfSense box), but other than those periods (roughly 5 hours per day down to 5M each way) it has 100% of my bandwidth.

similar to you, a few years ago i hit the same question. whilst i can code, it's not to the the spec required for a global financial payments system :) so, i run a node - i do use it when i ever spend any BTC (my tx's broadcast exclusively from my node), and in my mind it helps in the decentralized nature of the network plus gives bandwidth for others to bootstrap from whom start their own nodes in future.
it isnt much, but every little helps.
(edit: my tea mug at work also is "btc related" which has lead to some interesting convos too - i'm not a total evangelist, but i have pondered some questions to people which has made them think twice. ofcourse it's not wise to broadcast urself as a btc hodler, but at work i doubt anyone there is a "$5 wrench attack" type person :))

FIXED IT!!
i'm adding this in the hope that this helps someone via google at a later date, or for anyone "current" reading this now. 
**tl:dr - don't use the swap file on the sd card. use some HDD space for it - it's worth the sacrifice. **
so, i thought to myself, lets play with this. it's taken 16 days to get to 373K (current height @ BC.i is 442K), should be MUCH faster. i decided to "play" with the swap. this did mean i destroyed all that i had downloaded already, but so far i think it has been worth it and it's only been an hour.
following the guide here  is how i setup my system, and in every guide i have found suggests updating the swapfile size, which is onboard the SD card, from 100M to 1G: simply adding an extra 0 to the config file then performing some commands so the OS catches up with the changes (thru dphys-swapfile). whilst this does work, the swapfile being on the SD card COMPLETELY CRIPPLES the pi3.
STEP 1
firstly i got rid of the swap file completely: i started by following this random google: 
* sudo sync
* sudo swapoff -a
* sudo apt-get remove dphys-swapfile
* sudo apt-get purge dphys-swapfile
the purge also removes another package, "dc" i think - to be honest i wasnt paying attention - I just answered y. 2 holes in a bucket ...
* sudo rm /var/swap
* sudo sync
* sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile disable
* sudo rm /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile
... right. done. rebooted to confirm swap was 0 in top, so i know that no swap was configured. once i knew the SD swap was gone, i then started on getting the HDD sorted.
STEP 2
swap is still needed, so using fdisk, i repartitioned the the HDD: first 4G is swap as primary partition 1, remainder is primary partition 2 - for the blockchain itself. Then:
* update /etc/fstab with vi/nano: i added the following:




* sudo mkswap /dev/sda1
* sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda2
* sudo swapon -a
at this point, checked with top. I now have 4G of swap. ok this may be excessive, but as one of characters from one of my favourite films "tremors" notes (the "gun nut" burt) "when u need it, and don't have it, you sing a different tune" :)
at this point, rebooted and rechecked with top to ensure the 4G persisted. also checked with df -kh that the storage area (my case, "/mnt/bitcoin") has come online.
all good so far o i tried again. started up bitcoind and following with the cli command "getinfo". For me, it's been running just over an hour now, and i have already synced to a height of 210K. from this thread:  i had got to 340K in 8 days. ok, i havent reached that milestone yet however i appear to be closing in fast! I should also note:
* bitcoin-cli doesnt hang at all any more. it used to take atleast 10 seconds to respond, sometimes upto 30 (or even timeout) - as per my original comment
* a "stop" with the cli takes upto 30 seconds, before the stop took ALOT longer than that.
* i have not played with the dbcache parameter at alll: "straight from the tin" config.
so, that's it. i'll update this when i'm upto where i was 2 hours ago prior to playing. again, i hope this helps someone (even the random googlers)

ive just recently got my pi3 up and running as a full node using latest rasbain (not a noobs card image, the actual rasbian image), and using core 13.1. have a look at:  . it's still syncing (overall uptime is about 3 weeks now, and i'm "almost" synced at 432K - only another 12K-odd to go). pi's are not the best when it comes to the horse power needed during the IBD, but should be adequate once synced.
whilst the guide i used (it's in there in the OP) is pretty dated, this was still "roughly right" in terms of "what to do". i went with a laptop hd (1TB) which is powered from the USB of the pi: so nice a simple with wiring.
the only advice i give is, if using a "real" hd (not usb flash), is to get away from the swap file on the sd card and go to a "real" swap partition on the HD. i found the swap file on sd card totally crippled the pi3 due to IO overhead.

the difficulty of mining is based on the time taken to mine 2016 blocks (someone correct me on the numbers)
if the milestone of 2016 blocks is reached before the expected formula of "10mins since last adjustment \* 2016" then difficulty rises. similarly, if it's reached after the time, then difficulty drops. difficulty's only purpose is to maintain 10 min (on average) block discovery by all the miners across the whole network.
the reward in no way affects the difficulty directly, only indirectly in terms of costs to mine vs miners asking if it's worth it. as some may leave when the reward is halved, the hashing power of the whole network may drop, so next difficulty lowers due to greater than 10 minute block average: a state of equilibrium sotra exists (or is gamed for) with the miners and their overall hashing power vs the difficulty adjustments to keep 10 minute block averages.

right, i'm no expert, but i'd say yes (I have actually been considering this myself: acquire a short term mining contract for s2x - as short as possible, for the express intent of splitting) 
in my mind, if you polute (i choose this word aptly) a tx with a guaranteed s2x-only input as part of that tx, then it'll pass on s2x and fail on BTC - so at that point it has been split - coins on S2x side move, whereas coins on BTC side remain unspent.
my question is: does that put any funds at risk - i mean, if the private key has been used for the tx - which has completed for s2x but failed for BTC, does that expose a risk on the BTC side for coins being stolen by someone watching the s2x chain to try and claim BTC via it's exposed private key?
not knowledgeable about this part of how it works - i might be clutching at straws here ...
edit: if this is do-able/safe, i would probably give some ppl here a small s2x tx for them to assist in their splitting operations too - that small fraction of dust to use as a splitter. it may be a shitcoin, but the fraction become invaluable in aiding a successful split - MAYBE!!!

ok, i'm nit-picking here, but the true cost will be about 25% higher, as most psu's will be at best 80% efficient in converting mains to 5v for the pi, so should be factored-in as it's extra 25%. 
but in real terms, we are still talking peanuts in overall power usage :)

if you still have the 14.0 repo that you git-pulled (assuming you want to build from source), all you need to do is
- cd into the "bitcoin" directory (the git-pulled data)
- "git pull" (updates your git pulled data)
- "make -j2" (rebuilds. i use a pi3 too: j2 is ok for the pi)
once the build is done, stop you current bitcoind, then
- "sudo make install" (installs it- again from inside the git-pulled directory)
... then start bitcoind and you should be done. check it from 
edit: sudo added to make install - assuming you are building as non-root user. also clarification on directorys.

interesting board given cpu and memory available, however due to lack of direct attached storage the HC1 or HC2 is a better option for me (caveat: storage - i mean in a physical sense, i understand the HDD on HC1/HC2 is attached via USB3 chip so technically is not direct attached ... but you get what i mean :) )  - plus the HC1 and HC2 have 2 more cores than the N2.

you have understated this: it's the worlds first case of a 1st world country democratically electing to become a 3rd world country. whilst i dont like the eu zone in whole, better to stay in it that abandon it - for the influence within than nothing else. i'm sure others from the UK will have polar-opposing views on this (it was roughly 50/50 vote, but overall in favour to leave: **so be it** - i'm not anti-democratic), but i'm not gonna add any further to that comment or justify it more: my stance is clear on that one.
whilst i dont know about how things will pan out WRT bitcoin accessibility in march 2019 in the UK, the current decline in GBP valuation has already added a percentage to my on-paper gains of bitcoin vs GBP. i expect GBP to only get worse. at the same time, BTC overall trend is going up, so it's a double hit (caveat: i'm no financial analyst. if you follow my financial advice - a random person on the net - you are a moron and deserve to remain poor. do your own due diligence).
will brits start to hedge into bitcoin? i think so, and the closer to the time the more money will flow out of GBP and into other assets: btc included. whilst i'm not expecting much in terms of price hike as a result of +30M voters realising the shitshow they are now staring in, i do expect it to gently cause a general push upwards: more of a gentle wave remaining higher than before than tsunami of "oh-shit"-ers panic buying at the last minute.
it's important to remember that bitcoin is still an experiment, and could fail at any time - ony invest if you are prepared for a complete loss. i'm using it as a hedge, maybe even a retirement fund if GBP really does go to shit and BTC finally moons (i expect both to happen), and i'm tempted to go all in. if you think so too, and agree with me GBP is a sinking ship and are gonna jump, jump sooner rather than later - dont be the last man holding the steering wheel. i'm currently on the edge, assessing if  i can jump.
edit: last sentence should read "i'm currently on the edge, assessing if i **have the balls** to jump"

ok, no expert on this, but most exchanges "batch" their outbound tx's to minimize their fees (so multiple withdrawls are handled in parallel), but i dont believe you can request a specific fee for outbound from exchange to your own wallet.
going the other way, wallet to exchange, depends on the wallet in question. most wallets have an option somewhere, suggest you google that wallet - someone will have asked that question with your wallet in mind before (sorry for the jfgi response :)).

ok, i'm gonna be "that guy" here - sorry! (about the product, not your idea as a gift - i think that's good)
never been to that site, i have a copy of bitaddress.org on a offline machine which i use for paper wallet generation. i print then laminate my keys. i really liked the idea of the foldover stickyed part, then i watched the vid. 
If you pause at the 12 second point, where the priv key is exposed: i dont like the way it has "torn"/removed the print on the priv key part: fearful that someone whom you gift this too might accidentally tear it to the point the print is taken off, making the priv key text much harder to read/reconstruct. 
ok, the QR code is far enough away, and the priv key text is printed twice (i always use the text, not the qr code, when re-entering the keys: can u trust that qr code reading app?  only the paranoid survive :)), but feel that may be a danger with the stickers. i'm guessing you have made and used a couple to test with, interested on your thoughts on that. maybe lamination before stickies applied?

if you consider the paper wallet you have created to be for long term storage, keep it in a cool dark but dry place (to avoid damage to the ink), but one extra step you could (should)  take would be to also laminate the paper (back and front) to reduce the risk of damage from water/damp, or in case of accident. 
also, dont keep it all on a single paper wallet, suggest you spread you BTC across multiple wallets -

correct me if i'm wrong: when it comes to transactions, sure if btc1 clients are pretending to be core clients, they will not be kicked and transactions will be transferred between the two nodes, but the instant that a 'fake' node tries to transfer a large block it would be booted off, right? so the effective gain by this code trickery would be lost on the first block that core clients see as invalid, right?

when anyone asks me about how much BTC i have, i always ask back "how much do you have saved up in your bank account?". when they look at me funny, i always follow up their look with "well, your asking me about my financial details, so if we are gonna be that friendly, i thought i'd ask you about yours too". 
it tends to kill that convo cold, which i don't think is a bad thing given subject under discussion, which is ultimately "how much money do you have" - or "how well-off are you".

To trust politicians to take apart something so complex and critical in such a short time frame is total folly, esp given the quality of all our current politicians (whatever side of the fence your vote fell on).
politicians are only one rung up the ladder from bankers imo. i'll leave you with this thought:

the issue with your plan is trust: do you trust the image you download from a "random site" to be non-malicious? it may work as some form of open server proxy, working as part of a bot net stealing bitcoins from other unsuspecting users , and finally stitching you up by visiting known child porn sites - all as background tasks whilst it pretends to do as you ask: who knows!! taking my tin-foil hat off, pre-rolled means "blackbox": we dont know whats inside it, it just works - and that's bad from a security standpoint - because we dont know for sure if it's doing anything else.
because of that, most of the responses you'll get to this question will be of the "build your own" type ("download and run this", or "follow this guide"). I too would like a "pre-rolled" core-based raspbian build, but it's because of the above i doubt there are many (if any) about.
lastly, while is re-read this, a SD card may not be the best storage option: i would suggest you look into a usb thumb drive or even USB to sata adapter and sata HDD for the blockchain storage itself, leaving just the OS on the SD card. i believe a full node does an awful lot of read-writes, and will wear out an SD card quite quickly - i might be wrong, but that's what i read somewhere (may have been here).

@_date: 2016-10-31 10:49:28
i agree with your points listed above, but i dont think it's "right" to just drop the acceptance threshold from 95% - it's this high for a reason, to ensure continuity on the network during a soft fork.
i'm sure you are not suggesting we do this, i just felt compelled to answer that point before someone else does :)
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:50:00
i mean "eta on release of 13.1 binarys/sources for the masses", so i can update my node - not segwit activation: i understand that may take a while.

so am I, and here's my take on this:
easy? yes. 
safe? that's another question which is dependent on the system in question. 
easy and safe for bitcoin? I cant answer that one as i have not vetted the code - i will concede that. however your comment -


have u vetted the code then? if yes, please clarify WHY. please feel free to go full-on technical as to why.

my question was badly worded, i know votes are blocks within the 2016 blocks between retargets


that's the answer i was after: thanks.

if ViaBtc continues to hold back scaling once SW is released "non-RC" by continuing their stance in rogers pocket, all emphasis on "why bitcoin is not scaling" will be directed onto them, rather than being focused on 'core'. it will be seen as "the few holding back the many" on scaling.
i wonder what will happen then :)

@_date: 2017-05-08 20:01:07
the way i see it is "you dont" : make a transaction on unlimited chain to move to a new address, same on the core side to a different address: so you end up with 2 addresses, 1 for each side, both with coin in it. 
someone jump in and correct me if i'm wrong.

I can be a vindictive little shit (sometimes to my own detrement), however I'd make a point in a few years to drive by in ur swankey new expensive car (when btc truely has gone past 'moon' stage) and either:
- spark up a convo which u terminate early with "have nice life"
- simple drive-by middle digit
I'm sure some other inventive ideas can be struck up by fellow readers (perhaps that's worthy of a separate post), all I can say is I'm glad you ejected :D

ok, I'm not the worlds best script kiddy here, but for someone "this clever" (allegedly), surely the use of "mktemp" is warranted here rather than hardcoded temp file name? (esp. if "$filename" has pathing within it).

@_date: 2019-05-18 17:33:53
i'm generally speaking here, as i'm no expert, but if u have 2 copys of the exe and u are using only 1 copy of the blockchain, really you should only ever use the latest one once the latest has been used once. whilst i'm not aware of any changes from 17.1 to 18 in terms of different structure for the datadir, the newest version could add new features which the older will not understand - but in this case i doubt there will be much if anything.
i'm hesitant to give you an "all clear", as i do know in the past there has been changes in the way things are done: for example, i'm not sure what version update it was (15 -&gt; 16, or maybe 16 -&gt; 17) there was an update to the stucture of of the chainstate DB (i think - someone correct me please) which effectively made that update really a 1 way only process.
there's nothing stopping u copying the blockchain to a different location, so as to have the 2 chains independent based on exe being used (17 uses X, 18 uses Y), but that's quite wasteful. i'm also not sure if both would "play nice" with each other if both are running at the same time - as the ports they would try to use would be the same - so some reconfig may be needed here if thats you use-case
curious: why would you want both anyway?
edit: ive just this second upgraded mine from 17.1 to 18, and 18 will take the structe of 17's datadir no issues, if it made any changes i dont know, but i'm not fussed as i'm not intending to use 17.1 again.
edit2: grammar not i have
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:33:36
ok, thats great, so lets add the figures to my calcs, so myself and "random googlers" gets this right.
the example paper wallet has 10 transactions total, all inbound, and i wish to send to 4 outputs:
- 10 for the base
- 10 * 148 for the inputs (1480)
- 4 p2pkh * 34 for the outputs (136)
so, size of tx would be *roughly* 10 + 1480 + 136 = 1626 bytes
from there, multiply by sat/byte based on the urgency of your tx. i'm more interested in tx size at this point, plus this varies from day to day anyway, so not going onto that part.
so, does that look "about" right?
@_date: 2016-05-13 15:46:19

@_date: 2019-05-18 17:15:11
not quite sure what u are asking here - you mention having 2 versions of the exe on 2 drives, but is that also 2 copys of the blockchain on diff drives too?

imo thats a low target (thinking long term) - if bitcoin reaches the utility we all want with worldwide adoption to some degree, individual sats will be highly valuable, let alone entire coins.
