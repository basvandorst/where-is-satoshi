Awesome post, I'm new to btc also. Really interesting stuff. Still don't know what private and public keys r tho. Isn't that just adress and identifier

thats why they could take advantage, BC there's no laws firms can pump and dump, build it up by staggering large blocks of purchases all to cash out and breaking the price all to repeat the cycle. I would be highly surprised if hedge funds and private equity have not invested in btc let alone keep track of its movements
@_date: 2013-02-17 23:49:16
I &lt;3 btc
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:20:25
Totally agree man. I'm new also and its seems like alot of work, waiting and transfer fees to actually get the process going. I'm still undecided about the whole idea, but it really is cool and exciting.

@_date: 2013-02-17 00:01:20
I like that advice still feel bad tho

How am I tryna scam?
@_date: 2013-02-17 00:02:20
That's a good move
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:04:43
That's good stuff. Appreciate it. Your right the GLBSE crash is a damper, but a good indicator of btc's perseverance. I had two questions: can people do ddos attacks by automating transfers between wallets endlessly to and fro? And, when ppl steal btc from exchanges can't we just follow the money on the block chain until they cash out?
@_date: 2013-02-17 04:18:42
