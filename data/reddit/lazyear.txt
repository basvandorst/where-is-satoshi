Lmao I sold 30 BTC @ $30
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:43:43
Well I bought em at $5 so 600% profit. I don't really let it bother me, no way to know it would've taken off like it has

Yeah I mean it seems like you're doing almost 5x what I'm doing. For reference, I think my bot does on average around 50-80 trades per day, with $5-$150 trades depending on price vs my VWAP. I only do immediate-or-cancel limit orders. I should rewrite it to only do maker orders, but I've been slammed with real-life work stuff.
My alpha is currently at like -29% or something stupid - i.e. I under performed a simple buy-and-hold strategy from when I started by 29% - But I'm also at ~29% profit, so I won't complain. I was beating a buy-and-hold by about ~10% until the last two weeks. 
I'm doing this for fun &amp; learning - plus I kinda see the bot as risk minimization, at least how I have it programmed. It will likely not get me max returns, but I have less exposure to risk since it rapidly fluctuates how much money is actually allocated to BTC/fiat.

I'm a biologist... my code WAS written by a guy who taught himself everything he knows lol.
The buy sell signal is quite simple - if it senses a change in momentum then it calculates how much it should buy sell. I have it set up so that basically any kind of indicator could be plugged in. How's yours operating?

Dude I sold back when it hit the ATH of $30.
Hindsight is 20/20

Tell me about it, I feel exactly the same way. I remember paying $5/bitcoin. $4000 is just insane.

Programmed it myself in C Mines running on Gemini, which is why there is no margin. I've released an [open source library]( for interfacing with the exchange - my bot is less than 1000 lines of code on top of the library, and half of that is just setting up technical analysis indicators and backtesting capabilities.
Did you write yours?
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:25:27
Yep it's definitely possible. I make $5-10/day semi-regulary trading without margin on a $1400 account using moderate frequency trading. My bot has done $60,000 of volume in the last 30 days using that $1400.

Yeah I sold out at the ATH of $30.

I would like to adding some scripting functionality to it, allowing for algorithmic trading

Thanks for the link. I've got the VWAP calculations integrated already,  I'll look into doing VWAP trade execution.

Do you have any examples of websocket c# code. I had tried searching for some when just starting out, but couldn't find any. No external libraries
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:52:41
I switched everything over to websockets. You were right - so much better. Thanks for the suggestion

How do you buy groceries?

If you guys didn't already know, you can buy music with bitcoins at [digital-tunes.net](
