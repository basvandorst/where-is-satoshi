That's just like, your opinion, man.
(Full disclosure: I agree with you!)

This one's my fault, guys - I made a deposit of some BTC to wager on a basketball game that starts at 9PM UTC.  And... 0 blocks in the past 70 minutes; TEN blocks in the 70 minutes prior to my transaction.
And yes, I understand I didn't ACTUALLY cause this; I'm just irritated about a bit of random variation that's happened to cause a minor inconvenience for me! :-)
Glass half full: my intended wager would probably have lost, anyway.

Because Miladran's transactions are NOT being confirmed in "2-5 mins" regardless of the fee.  Blocks are mined, on average, somewhere in the neighborhood of every 10 minutes.
Currently the last block was mined over 80 minutes ago.  Which means that, even if your fee was 2BTC, you still couldn't have gotten a transaction confirmed at any point in the last 80 minutes.
The reason why yours is stuck is at least in part because of bad luck!  Nobody in the world - NOBODY - has had a transaction confirmed in the past 80 minutes. :-)

Exactly - this is a very good response.  
It's not a matter of the fee; even if someone had included a huge fee of 2BTC with a transaction, it still wouldn't have been confirmed yet, because no blocks have been mined in the past 80 minutes.  Nobody on Earth (or any other location) has had their transaction confirmed in the past 80 minutes, regardless of the fee they included.

This is the best answer.  Let him waste a week or a month trying it, and after that time when he as nothing to show for it either he'll keep doing it (if he's a moron) or he'll stop doing it (if he has the ability to learn).
Honestly, he's not really hurting himself, so why not let him run the experiment and see the results?  It seems like a decent chance for him to learn about mining and why it's NOT worthwhile to use your phone to mine Bitcoin.

This is a great point.  Even with the ZOMG HUGE CRASSSSSH narrative that's common today, the Dow was higher at the end of 1987 (just 2 months after the "crash") than it was at the start of 1987.
On 1/2/87 the DJIA was at 1927.
On 12/31/97 the DJIA was at 1938.
Bitcoin could "CRASHHHHHHH" to $3000 tomorrow and it would still represent a 200% gain for the year.  People need to try to keep things in perspective, as you've clearly done with this post.  Well done, I say.
