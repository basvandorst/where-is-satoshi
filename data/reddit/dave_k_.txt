Have the folks at WTFqrcodes.com gotten a clue yet about the usefulness this brings to bitcoin?  Some of the posts there are indeed funny, but mostly seems like QR code troll blogging.

Has there been any analysis of the blockchain (and orphaned blocks) where these race attacks occur? Are they on the rise?

Can we just start with something basic?  Like are there any mobile wallet apps that can sign a 2-of-3 txn?

Although this is a great guide describing the process, its old and incorrectly states at the beginning "The fee, when it is required, is usually worth less than one US cent."   With .0002 to .0005 being the standard fees I've seen most clients use, this equates to 16 to 41 cents fee per transaction in today's prices.  Quite a difference!

This depends upon the client you are using to send BTC. Normally the client will calculate the fee and automatically add it from your wallet to the transaction.  You shouldn't have to add it yourself manually.

I can post an item for sale on my blog today (for bitcoins) and not pay anyone a "fee" for the sale.  So sure, you could post an item on OB and NOT leverage any of the potential services mentioned in this article to protect yourself from fraud or anonymize your shipping, or increase your search rankings, etc, for free.

Can the tip.me button be placed on your twitter profile or does twitter themselves have to do some kind of integration?

Newbie question: if someone finds the recovery seed that I write down, would they be able to recreate all the keys in my wallet without me knowing and steal my coins?  If true, then security wise how is this any better than a printer paper wallet?

Who else initially read this title as referring to "New Jersey"?

This is rehashed news from an ABC interview done a month ago.

Great point, thanks.  Ok so I think I get it now.  Security wise its no better than a BIP38 encoded paper wallet, but the real value with the hardware wallet is being able to more easily spend from them than a paper wallet.

Sellers cannot accept Bitcoin on Square Marketplace, then can only accept USD.  What the title of this article should have read was Square now lets buyers pay with Bitcoin.  Small wording difference, but huge difference in terms of value to Bitcoin ecosystem.

Can anyone from blockchain.info confirm they are working to get their app back into the app store?

For long term storage, what has the greater risk of loss bitcoins? BIP38 encrypting private keys and storing in multiple locations, or storing unencrypted private keys in a bank owned safety deposit box?
I'm thinking there is a greater chance I'll die or forget or misplace the passphrase than a bank getting robbed.  From what I've read, Andreas Antonoplous also goes the unencrypted and bank route.
The only con of the safety deposit box I can think of is some kind of legal action where seizure of property and assets are court ordered.  Assuming you are not a criminal, what are the odds of this vs forgetting passphase or dieing?

I recently switched to Breadwallet on iOS which supports BIP70, but can't find any merchant to try out the experience.  I think you are right, its been slow to adopt, but I wasn't sure if it was merchant side or wallet side.  Perhaps both?

What's important here is, a 10 yr old who can't get a credit card or bank account made an online purchase with a secure payment mechanism, AND it was simple!

I've heard Juan Llanos speak at a local bitcoin meeting, and I'll admit his outlook did scare me, given the amount of experience he has had with government regulation, and the extent at which government/politicians will go to secure their place in society.  So if anything, I think their uncertainty around regulation is simply knowing this could potentially get a lot worse...but I hope not.
