I agree fully, Bitcoin is not just a number, it is the future.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:57:45
Then I do not regret my post.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:55:38
Is my post true or false? :D
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:51:38
Thank you for clarifying. If you lowered the minimum fee, would you be assisting the people who had smaller fees or would they still not be confirmed?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:00:13
Thank you for your help.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:39:31
How would I set up a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:41:52
Thanks, I think this will work.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:54:27
Either way it did not rip in half until it capsized and I yes I believe in it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:47:14
I did not have comments saying I was delusional when bitcoin was at $20 K.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:56:28
I would hope so.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:42
Visit this subreddit in 3 months and lets continue this conversation.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:04:26
Yes I am aware that Linux is more secure, but, this is my only device. Obviously, TOR won't let me download much and anything that could be downloaded is on a different drive. Is everything I have set up necessary? What would happen without this?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:26:08
People would have laughed to see bitcoin at more than $8000 2 years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:03:34
just posted to r/buttcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:50:33
Anyway of speeding the process up if I owned a node? This is just for example sake.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:01:34
what about an Electrumx node?
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:33:41
Thank you, I would not mind this as I would like to be able to help people out with this problem as this happened to me once. Would they have to be using my node or can they change nodes?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:24:15
Ok, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:14:53
How would this benefit? Cheaper mining fees or quicker?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:52:24
I do not believe Titanic was ripped in half by the iceberg, but ok.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:54:15
It might not have to be personal, just an anonymous email.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:03:59
I am sure this dip has culled many of the Bitcoin noobs :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:08:43
What if my node provided a service?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:44:47
My thoughts, luckily I did this at $7K.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:51:50
I thought about getting the ledger nano s, which out of the two is better, in your opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:22:42
Hey, thanks for the response, I had seen a post somewhere about a guy with a low fee transaction being 'stuck' and someone with a node had helped them, I'll try and find it.
EDIT: I think that this may have been done by mining the individual users transaction ID.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:02:40
ahah, just happy to see a rise.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:18
Well, not really, just showing people the opportunities, I haven't actually earned that amount yet. As a rule, start small until you have figured out what you're doing. This is a gamble and people should be prepared to lose every penny.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:18:24
I do not but I was wondering if it will keep USD ans an option for storage, I like it as it is stable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:42:50
This is a good day for BTC so far......
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:11
Is the sub safe?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:42
Well, I kinda did that a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:33:50
For $19000 this is not too bad though, considering it pays for the miners who are being vastly under-paid. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:43:01
And going.... 14,580
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:24:45
Yes, I had considered this. Would make a nice gift.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:41:02
I'm not sure but his number is 0121 go do one.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:50:33
It worked ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:16:15
I would even be happy transferring the BTC my self.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:45:29
Thanks, Ill have a look.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:23:05
I am more interested in giving a physical gift, I had looked at denarium coins but they are too expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:15:33
Is it safe to give a dodgy phone number you credit card details and social security number?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:36:10
But then I have to pay fees for transaction, meaning that I have to risk more to get a higher increase in the day.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:20:10
I would perform heart surgery on my self.

possibly joking
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:56
I started with Streamr and then earned the bulk, so far with NEO.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:20:41
well we hit 15177
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:51:34
Well, I think it boosts the communities motivation to trade in such a promising currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:57:14
I've been here since January and have seen a few drops, I was more on about the last day. I know Bitcoin is extremely volatile I am just curious as I am with most drops, why did it happen. Maybe then I can foresee the next one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:06:43
Was definitely thinking of bitcoin as not many crypto muggles have heard of it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:54:11
Ahaha I think it was less!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:37:49
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:25:41
That wasn't really the problem, I had seen posts about being locked out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:06:31
For most exchanges I have found you have to be 18.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:19
I use Bitfinex and am at $17,460 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:57
And that's the secret :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:17:39
I will take this as a compliment
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:19:02
I would not steal bitcoin I am more concerned about the safety of my own funds as should everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:23:16
IDk but I made a 1 sat fee transaction on October 21st and it came through in about 3 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:36
Yeah, thanks I've been trading for about 6 months just testing the waters and have started just 25 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:33:13
Well, technically serial but who cares :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:40:41
Its still goin...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:56:19
I was thinking I might have to trade when it is stationary and leave it be when its rising.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:38
I think it will reach 17.9K cos why the hell not.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:29:43
Anyone care to explain why they sold out yesterday or this morning?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:25:53
True, I guess its all a risk anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:13
Thanks, I'd seen this before.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:53:28
I have pmed you
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:05:21
Is this worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:34:28
I HODL 50% of funds and day trade (successfully) the other half.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:43
I have PayPal, is this the only trading sub or are there more?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:56:28
I thought that was only in one exchange and was an error, but correct me if I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:03:00
I knew he had done investments before via his bank so I believe him.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:37:23
I bloody hope so....
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:10:23
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:58:39
Thanks for the reply, that would make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:45:41
Possibly levelling out now...
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:12:08
Thanks, I'll add you for future reference.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:24
We hit 17000
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:48:01
I'm watching, always watching...
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:57:51
Almost been here for a year, look at my previous comment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:43:36
No breaks, keep going
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:26:18
Do you think it could prove more profitable than mining?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:46:25
well, that was short lived.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:25:56
If I loved him for money I wouldn't really love him at all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:47:06
No problem, I did word one of my replies quite badly.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:17:11
What exchange are you using?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:20:25
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:29:03
It becomes very hard to day trade without.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:40
at 14441 signing out
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:24:25
I was thinking that sometimes people enter the wrong wallet and you could find that transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:43:44
True, I try to gain more than BTC increases on that day. So yesterday was an extremely good day and I had an increase of 15%, meaning I could have withdrew my money but last week I had a mere 0.74% increase, not feasible.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:04:46
Unfortunately the nearest is 160 KM.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:48:22
Maybe, if we say its going down it will go up :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:34
I would buy via family/friend if any of them had bitcoin in wallets ready to share.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:26:51
I think it's his sense of humour.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:00:20
I think I'll go ledger, thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:04:44
I will definitely look into this but I was looking for something more quirky.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:59
My sarcasm has not been taken as I thought :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:15:58
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:56:52
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:01:33
I was worried that my account had been suspended
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:57:06
I am using Bitfinex and I am currently at $1720
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:23:49
Not really, don't really know why I would lie about this, its not me thats getting rich :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:35:19
My dad still thinks its fake.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:41:08
Cos I'm a mass murderer.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:09
Thanks for the help, I think I'll use this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:55:21
Thanks, I was hoping people would respond like this. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:06:21

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:47:29
I have a weekend job, and I had considered investment? which cryptocurrency would you recommend?
