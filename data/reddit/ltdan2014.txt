Profits on neglect. How do you think a shelter operates?

I definitely wouldn't be buying a Mercedes.

Be careful, if you fall of that horse you might hurt yourself. You know because it’s so high and all. 
You are bragging on the internet about your intelligence. How much irony is there in that?

Ever been here? Its pretty freaking awesome.

Briggs and Stratton... Nice

Some definitely do. But luckily if you are intelligent, you can choose a bank that fits your needs.

What I ended up doing was just using the money I got back to buy bitcoin, and sent it to my Coinbase account. I would've done that in the first place, but I needed Authy on my iphone (which at the time had a broken screen) to do two-factor authentication to login, and I got stuck using Bitstamp. I sold that bitcoin this morning and sent it to my BofA account for maybe .30cents of fees. I wont make the same mistake again.

I understand that. For Bitstamp though that is the only option to get your money to your bank account. I need the money quickly and didn't think it through. Lesson learned I guess.

remind me when something comes of this

What group is that? XRP seems to actually have some method to the madness when it comes to crypto.

My sister goes to Auburn and sent me a snapchat of this guy, knowing my interest in bitcoin. In the back of my mind I was like, Damn, thats a good idea!
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:13:09
You're right. I thought it more of a joke than anything. Although that guy at the game sure wasn't subtle. Just read your username as well. Well played. Well Played..

I actually broke down to buy the minimum .1 today off Coinbase. I really wish I could've spend $5 instead of $48. Especially if the price is going to keep rising as it has the past year. Three months from now if someone wanted to get in on the BTC market that minimum could be WAY up to a price that wouldn't even be worth spending.

Well it depends on how much you wager. Im up to 7k already and I haven't been playing much at all. Although I bet very high and have gotten pretty lucky
