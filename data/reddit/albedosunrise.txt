Who said I'm "telling you what to do"?!  I'm saying that the community is making a mistake to look at it like an investment.  At best it creates unstable bubbles you may profit from in almost a ponzi-like manner -- briefly, and at worst, this attitude leads to constant disillusionment with the currency among those who could assists its long term adoption.  Look at the !@ price.  It's not an investment any more.  You are not ahead of the curve.  People know about bitcoin.  If you want to treat it as such, go ahead, I'm just saying we need to stop evangelizing it this way.
I do not think Bitcoin is a stable investment anymore.  Everybody knows about it.  It is, however, an amazing financial tool.  The more people see it as the latter, the more it will gain actual widespread acceptance by people who could benefit from it.
You are, however, free to do what you like from it.  I'm just *encouraging* people to start speaking about Bitcoin different because I honestly think in the long run it's a more healthy way to discuss the phenomemon.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:58:36
You're right it's also an asset -- though it's utility there is limited due to its instablity. 
That said, I don't think 'traditional' economics is really limiting definitions here... 'traditional' economics defines three reasons for money existing:
As a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of account.
Bitcoin fairly meets all three of these "traditional" purposes to varying degrees. But investment is not one of these purposes, and I think recent activity shows that this is a misguided way to think about the currency.  (After all, is the internet valuable because buying .com domain names can get you rich, or because the internet is inherently useful in ways that don't necessarily make money?)

lol @ "Bitcoin will never change."  As we are seeing, like fiat money, it's malleable.

It's a statement.  You are free to agree, and you are free to disagree.  You add zero value to this conversation by simply claiming that I shouldn't be making a statement.
Dispute my assertion of it you disagree.  Don't just attack that I shouldn't be able to persuade people to my point of view.  I made a point of view I think many in the bitcoin community are beginning to agree with but are not vocalizing.  This was my attempt to communicate.  I welcome rebuttals.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:38:22
Could be true.  Either way I don't think they cared about him that much.
After all, there are plenty of smart people who come up with good ideas.  The government is likely more interested in how to respond to new tech like this when it comes, rather than pursuing the visionaries.

Or a coin like auroracoin comes along, with a distribution system infinitely fairer than anything that bitcoin has, and then support transfers there.
Afterall, why should laymen folk accept the premise that early techies should hold all the riches??  Fuck that, let's make a new coin, *then* enjoy its benefits on an equal playing field.  That's what a coin with real adoption will look like.

Having a financial company turn off its website, *delete* their twitter account, and have their CEO resign from the Bitcoin Foundation, with a not a single blip or explanation is not exactly inspiring confidence.
What do you think is more likely... that MtGox is record-breakingly stupid despite being solvent, or that something is terribly wrong?
If you're referring to Bitcoin on other exchanges then yes I agree.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:00:29
How many people actually have the capacity to control this much bitcoin at once?
Not many suspects to choose from with an amount that large. Just get a few big exchanges to confirm that it's not from their wallets and you've narrowed down the search almost completely.

I genuinely think his stroke could be related to this, especially since the later note was written later, and the article referred to a stroke he had earlier.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:47:05
Likely why nobody ever found him.  After all, a lot of his counterparts usually had a bit of a penchant towards conspiracy theories and a deep distrust of where things could come from.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:57:06
There's nothing wrong with trying to get publicity for an altcoin.  All popular things are usually followed by a good publicist.
Dogecoin has inflation features and a coin number amount that actually make it much more suited to transactions.  Bitcoin is a good store of wealth, but far too deflationary to be successful for a transactions.  This is reflected currently in Dogecoin having more transaction activity than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:03:20
Hold them.  People must have felt devastated when the price of bitcoins fell huge back in 2011, but anyone who sold back then must feel like an idiot now.

That's a very interesting way of looking at this.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:31:43
In the normal world we usually look at a number of pieces of evidence, and when they reasonably align, then we believe that version of events.
Satoshi never wanted to be found, so you aren't getting the guy to hand over his digital signatures even if you had all the other evidence lined up...

@_date: 2014-02-25 09:01:20
While that's true, if merchants are going to start adopting it, then there is going to be a need for a futures-type market to provide some stability, necessitating transaction fees, and getting rid of one of Bitcoin's primary advantages: low transaction fees.
Maybe the answer is some form of cryptocurrency where the price can be pegged to a certain exchange rate.  If anyone can figure out how to do that, Bitcoin is dead.

I think it's an inherently selfish act to expect that one is entitled to privacy while simultaneously trying to create life changing technologies that will completely disrupt the world.  It's like being happy with knowing that nuclear bombs exist, and never seeking out the real story behind how they were built.
Just because Nakamoto is a hermit, doesn't mean that we need to respect his call for privacy.  The man launched a direct assault against the world financial system, they have a right to try to seek out knowledge on who he is.

If you want an expectation of privacy, then don't go out creating a paradigm attempting shift of replacing all government fiat.

But it doesn't seem like he would be safe from criminal prosecution if he lived in Japan.
It's not like he's an anonymous hacker on Silk Road who could try to launder the money out, i'd argue it would be difficult for him to move any where and be immune from getting arrested/attacked if it's true he just outright stole coins.

I'm interested in seeing the proof you have regarding the alleged timeline of events here.  It would go a long way in substantiating the veracity of the "Crisis Strategy Document."

Couldn't we objectively test this finding the largest wallets and then checking their transaction activity? (assuming it's not distributed over many small wallets  -- even then, the aggregate of those could reveal something if activity with them has remained stagnant).
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:19:31
How do you know they are insolvent?
Transaction malleability was a real issue and a legitimate reason to suspend trading.  Do you have anything more than conjecture to support this point?
(given how low prices are on Mt. Gox it's tempting to go there.)

"Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""
I would call that pretty good proof if the reporter is properly reporting what happened.

Funny enough, it's probably strongly in Iceland's favour to embrace it.

Considering none of the other programmers of Bitcoin have not been sued is an indication that I think your concern is unfounded.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:47:09
Perhaps the problem is stemming from the gold rush around mining in the first place.  The network just needs to be good enough to be maintained.  I think we'll find the replacer to bitcoin will use coin distribution systems that radically disrupt Bitcoins mining approach (auroracoin being a strong indication of the new trend).

But is Mt. Gox actually insolvent, or incompetent?  They've weathered many scandals in the past and seemed to survive.
If it's the latter, then buying Bitcoin at the price it is now, even if it means waiting for a month, is a premium well worth it.  If you have actual evidence they are insolvent, then that's a whole different story.

The other journalists got the assignment, did a few Google searches, couldn't find anything, and gave up.
However, in the big leagues, professional journalism actually invovles digging up what already doesn't exist.  THAT'S the big difference.

Debate is the wrong word.  The point of debate is to defend a position to the point of digging in your heels.  The point of discussion is to mutually enlighten and nuance both people participating.
