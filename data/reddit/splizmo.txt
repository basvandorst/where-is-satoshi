I'm wondering if a similar solution could be used for an identity system though. An application could "color" the coins so they could not be moved and used to create a new identify. This might be preferable to proof of burn.

whatever happened to bitbook.biz? that place was sweet!
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:31:26
Drugs not Bitcoin. But his dogs were shot.
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:56:44
But these companies are not trying to market Bitcoin. The point is they will save money if only one person uses Bitcoin, so to them it's a win/win to offer the reward. If this is offered by many retailers, consumers may realize that all they have to do is use Bitcoin and they will receive the reward no matter where they shop.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:32:40
It was In the pioneer press I believe. Can't find the link on my phone sorry. But this wasn't about Bitcoin so you probably aren't that interested.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:13:06
So awesome! Thanks for all the work!
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:19:31
If I'm not mistaken this exact thing just took place In st Paul mn

Hopefully never... either way, I won't see it.
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:41:49
So not sure that this matters. But I was at the Minnesota state fair this week and there was a coke set up where you could put any name on the bottle.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:54:09
cool. Twolves won.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:41:55
Minneapolis please...
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:11:05
Do the needful.
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:49:07
I'm hoping at least $800ish. My prediction though is $402.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:30:29
I officially commemorate thee, Bitcoin Day!
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:17:00
Sweet. I bought from Coinbase via USAA. It's me!!!
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:34:05
Dang, was up in brainerd a couple weeks ago. I should have stopped by.
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:40:22

Do the Vikings ever win a superbowl?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:06:40
Nice! Just bought 2 tickets last Friday as well. It went smooth. And if people are wondering, there was NOT a 0.1 fee.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:08:25
No one said this crypto stuff wasn't risky.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:28:33
Dang was just in PR in august for my wedding, wish I coulda spent some coin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:06:51
send me ur wallet.dat file so I can put some $$$ in dere. Then I'll send it back.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:50:32
Did you design the website when pogs were still cool?
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:04:58
I can pretty much much guarantee most everyone was not working on Thursday and probably Friday too. Thanksgiving is one of the US' main holidays and many people do not work on Friday either. They probably have someone on call at least but probably doesn't involve returning individual support emails.
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:52:07
yeah, but damn that would be sweet
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:04:01
If you go to the site and read the FAQ it explains how it is fair. Seems pretty legit to me.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:14:35
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:48:33
As I've heard stated many times on this sub-reddit, there is a flaw in this logic. Why spend USD when you could have converted to BTC and see gains?
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:54:19
Buying is the best, followed by stealing.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:23:12
Super interesting stuff, you may be interested in reading this discussion on bitcoin agents. The author argues that security for this type of system may be impossible and it does seem rather convincing. But still, super cool. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:30:40
Ahh, yea not sure then. Good luck though!
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:04:30
yea, and grizzly adams had a beard.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:46:02
I bought a bottle a couple weeks ago. It's super spicy... and good!
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:27:49
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:06:37
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:46:11
It would be up the retailer. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:49:14
Buy please
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:45:30
same here! Great customer service!
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:51:26
Just buy! Why do people keep asking this? If you thought the answer was no, you wouldn't to buy in the first place.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:29:41
Went there fir the first time in august and never been there before! It was awesome, where did you stay!
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:03:40
can't wait
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:57:16
1.get bitcoins
2.send to wallet
3.go to moon
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:43:12
Some of us don't care. We're not trying to buy drugs or porn. If you are, I suggest buying in person.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:00:49
makes sense
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:06:59
lol, I want nachos. What can we do to get this hypothetical nacho company to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:16:13
If I remember there is like a 7 day wait once your purchase is made. That was in April though.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:44:39
no bitbook.biz? I'm just a user but an awesome sports betting site.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:49:07
Buy Pogcoin, you can redeem them for real Pogs!
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:42:05
Are u in the US? Coinbase then. It will take a while to get your coin though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:49:50
well compared to the last few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:51:00
cool story. You're reason for getting out leaves a little to be desired but grats!
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:13:07
What's ur queso dip situation like?
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:26:34
Really? I would not use that method personally.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:40:22
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:31:36
I've heard the name, but yeah, I'm not super familiar with the figure heads. Seems kind of silly for a decentralized network.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:54:49
I love u guys
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:32:06
I'm not selling at $1,000, but I may me spending. Does that count?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:18:25
I'm no expert, but I think your transaction was never picked by anyone. This happens sometimes. Try refreshing your connection or whatever in your wallet and see if that transaction is still there.
@_date: 2013-06-11 12:36:03
Thanks, yeah I have other wallets backed up just didn't get to this one (dumb I know). Oh well, replacing slash fixing phone is going to cost me more anyway.
@_date: 2013-06-11 12:34:28
Yeah going to see if the screen can be replaced. Its a nexus 4.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:41:57
He's saying most likely there office is closed since Wednesday. So really your support email isn't 5 business days old. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:48:15
Exactly, if you think the price is going higher, it doesn't matter if it's $500 or $800 really.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:04:59
fair enough
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:04:19
so we're going back to $200? I find that harder to believe than $700-800. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:58:54
That sucks. But I think pretty much anyone would have done the same as you. I mean wasn't that like 3 pizzas a year before that or something? Too bad you didn't do a split or something though. Even just 1,000 to go with the $.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:34:01
Just do half!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:26:41
I'm interested. But what I really want to do is hook up an lcd display as well that will show my balance in BTC/USD. That would be sweet! Not too hard either I would assume
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:18:06
you don't have to invest in bitcoin either. You can just buy some and then use it to buy stuff online you would by anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:46:17
Web or native? I used multibit when starting out. No complaints.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:42:53
nexus 4. Can't remember the android wallet client.
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:48:48
That video made me sick.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:02:01
Trading something for it is usually the way to go. Try US Dollars, people will generally go for that. Heck, there are even some web sites that have exchange rates for these type of trades!
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:51:09
Do you just want to buy bitcoin to get started. If you're in the US, most will recommend Coinbase or localbitcoins. I use Coinbase and it was not too hard.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:15:24
Jimmy Fallon should do an impression of that middle dude. I'd tip some coin for that.
@_date: 2013-06-11 12:33:42
True that. Have my other wallet(s) backed up but just didn't do this one yet as it was pretty new. Oh well, not like I lost everything. Plus got some good suggestions from people.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:18:21
A der!? Pogs are only the greatest things ever. They are essentially round cardboard circles used in a game of skill played by many American youth in the mid 1990's. Legend/Myth/Science has it that Pogs will become the new currency of the world after the demise of all computers caused by the Y3K bug. Haven't you taken a history class? QED we're just going to get the POG/crypto currency off the ground now so it's ready by the year 3,000.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:46:24
hmm, why would coinbase need you username and password. Are you sure it wasn't a scam site meant to look like coinbase?
@_date: 2013-06-11 12:33:54
good call. thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:47:34
twould be sweet! Haxxah, for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:29:10
How do we know it's fair?
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:56:37
A web wallet is a web application that stores your bitcoins. This might be more convenient but is usually more prone to hacking and such. Native wallet clients like multibit, electrum, and armory run on your computer and are safer (assuming you keep your computer pretty clean of virus' and such). I've heard good things about Armories security but I don't actually use it yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:33:42
and hopefully your last.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:37:46
I spent $400 worth of BTC today. 2 Months ago, I had about $400 worth.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:25:37
The price is going down? Hadn't noticed.

Bitgov Protocol? Mine your votes!
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:22:23
It can't really have anything to do with the bitcoin blockchain itself or they wouldn't have "come back". Must just be something weird with MultiBit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:44:59
This is how I understand it. He "gives" it to himself and the other miners accept it because he solved the block.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:07:00
My wife was annoyed that I spent money on fake money and wouldn't stop talking about it. Until 2 weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:13:20
Use a calculator to convert the price in BTC to USD and compare prices.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:58:48
That's me. I want to spend but I still think the value is too low.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:57:59
K, I'll just hibernate till then.

@_date: 2013-11-29 22:05:46
Bought two tickets to Vegas from Cheapair.com for about 0.38 BTC. That was sweet. Going to buy that back though.

why does your age matter?
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:38:41
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:14:14
No we don't. We need merchants to price in bitcoins instead of dollars converted to bitcoins. This isn't really possible because the value is very volatile but I think this could actually lead to a more stable price.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:28:05
Slammers yo! You had to slam the shit out of those pogs to get them to flip over. If they flipped over, you got to keep them. It was super binary/wicked.!
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:19:09
It's alive!
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:43:14
Sweet you've inspired me too... My first BTC purchase actually.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:10:33
Why should miners keep working after all the coins have been mined?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:13:38
But the price has gone down? haha I know just having some fun. While your absolutely right, I find it funny that naysayers like to say that Bitcoin will fail because there is incentive to hoard. Except that if you think Bitcoin has a high percentage of failing then there is actually incentive to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:13:57
I've got about .3 on a cell phone with a broken screen. Still hoping I can recover them though.

It should plateau somewhere around the moon.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:56:09
I know people who I think would be very happy for a bit o BTC but wouldn't buy it for themselves. That's who to give it to.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:39:45
Isn't that the same with bitaddress.org? I'm assuming I can trust one of the major wallet clients. Should I not?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:38:41
Whoa that's sweet
