That's still pretty expensive, tbh
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:59
How so?  Because you don't like the name?  
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:08:13
No. It is not. If one man can go on TV and speak his mind (a right he is entitled to, btw) and singlehandedly wreck Bitcoin, then Bitcoin doesn't deserve to be king.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:19
How dare you question the hivemind. How dare you, sir. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:00
Or...or... Someone who thinks it is in a speculative bubble has already gotten out or doesn't think it wise to invest?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:26:29
Holy hell this sub is dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:05:40
Lol, wtf.
Remember the days when people who were in to Bitcoin wanted government out of their lives? I miss those days.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:57
Pathetic if anyone actually believes this nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:40
So the lesson is blame others for your own weak hands.  Duly noted.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:12:21
Why buy Bitcoin at this point? That $250 is gonna get eaten up in fees once you try to move it off the exchange...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:24:19
Lol, only now you are doing this? Good luck with those tx fees, btw.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:01
You have nothing to worry about. Your $100 investment is not turning into $10,000 overnight. I hope that helps put your mind at ease.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:22
Makes any bitcoiner using the word "attack" look like a dumbass.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:50
Please explain how BCH will have worse scaling issues.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:48:24
The theory, in a nutshell, is that Bitfinex is using Tethers created out of nothing (with no actual USD backing) to artificially pump up the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:16:38
I completely agree with you.  Agree with everything you said.  Just to be clear -- the people on this sub are not calling for some market-based regulation.  They are specifically referencing the SEC and referring to insider trading as a "crime."
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:46


I would point you to Steam's announcement earlier this week...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:06
The kind of garbage post that makes it to the top of r/bitcoin -- surprised?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:13:37
You can believe that, or you can look at the reality of the situation:  more and more companies are embracing BCH because of the low fees and fast transactions while BTC adoption by business is stagnant at best.  It is true that bagholders are piling into BTC right now, but there will be an end eventually if the coin remains unusable.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:43:25
Great poast. Really nice meme, never seen it before.
To answer your question -- Bitcoin is going up because it is in a speculative bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:00:04
Who will use it to buy anything when it costs so much to actually spend it? There's a post on the front page right now where a guy has $1,300 in tx fees to send $4,800 worth...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:53:48
One only needs to look at Valve's decision earlier this week regarding accepting Bitcoin on Steam in order to estimate how likely this is to happen ever.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:45
In its current unusable state? Insanity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:55
Literally the first decent comment I've read in this sub all day.  Remember when crypto was about creating a world where the State didn't control the money supply and there was a general anti-government sentiment around people who followed crypto?  
This sub is nothing but petulant children crying, "government, protect me!"  "Government, make the bad people go away."  "Government save us!"  It's disgusting really.
These people want the SEC to step in -- the same entity that allowed Madoff to run a ponzi for decades right under their noses.  The same entity that did nothing to curb the mortgage-backed securities trading that ushered in the housing crisis.  As long as it suits them they'll give up everything for the State.  Fools.

Lol Bitcoin's usefulness confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:21:06
I've never heard of people having issues with their bank accepting funds from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:26:54


By "modified crypto" I assume you mean Bitcoin as presented in the white paper -- a peer to peer electronic cash system?  Because that is what Bitcoin Cash is and that is not at all what Bitcoin currently is.


Never said I didn't want rules on an exchange.  But that is not what people are calling for based on the comments that I am reading on this sub.  They want an SEC investigation.  I'm all for boycotting a company that you think has wronged you in some way.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:53:21
The price will eventually correct to reflect its true value. In Bitcoin's case that is approximately zero (due to impossibly high fees and ridiculous confirmation times).
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:20:43
Um, no.  Nice try though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:07:10


Isn't he out of jail?
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:10:06
This is awesome. Do you have larger prints available?
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:19:23
Honestly, if you had 18" x 24" or 24" x 36" I would have bought it in an instant.
I'm not an artist so I don't know how it would scale up. Really awesome piece though, I love it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:21:29
Because no business owner with a brain will adopt a coin with the current transaction fees and wait times.
Bitcoin is just the game of the greater fool at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:43:00
The truth is outside of acceptable opinion here.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:21:14
Has nothing to do with altcoins. Has everything to do with the actual use case for muh digital gold.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:25:50
Why did you sell if you were down?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:52:31
Yes, almost guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:59:42
One coin is wildly overvalued?
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:47:39
Until everyone realizes there is no real world use case for it because of high fees and tx times and there is a simultaneous rush for the exit.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:42:36
This guy gets it.

Confirming that nursing homes and hospitals always operate at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:23:35
The price will plummet, in my opinion. As people lose their jobs they will exit to fiat (usable currency) so that they can pay rent and put food on the table. 
If the central banks start injecting more cheap money into the economy, then investors may flock to a safe haven like gold. I mean, who knows...maybe they move back into Bitcoin but that's a tough call. Cryptos haven't had to survive a recession like 2008/9 so it will be interesting to see what happens. I feel certain prices drop in the short term after one hits though (as will the prices of most things).
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:40:07


Except that, you know, when you invest in a 401k you actually have equity in a company, hold bonds, etc.
I too want a real explanation of why?  The answer cannot be "because of its function as a currency" because:
1) There are a bunch of coins that do that better (including the USD, incidentally), and 
2) We are constantly told it is in fact *not* intended to function as a currency, but rather as a "store of value."
Everything else in your post is basically it goes up in price because someone else down the road is willing to pay a higher price for it.  The question still remains....why???
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:27:00
It's a small price to pay for muh "digital gold."

The only sane comment in this thread so far...
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:27:08
An example, please?
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:19:26
I am saying that we can remove government from society and that those institutions will continue to operate to fill a need in the marketplace. Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:36:29
The problem is, at least in the US, there isn't enough adoption of crypto for purchases of everyday household items. 
You seem to be talking about a case of runaway inflation. I don't think that is a likely scenario in the near term, at least for the USD.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:54:08
Honest question:  Do you really consider persons spending their money in the way they best see fit in a free and open market an "attack"?  Seems like an odd way to view the world...
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:36:15
You sound like a petulant child. People are free to direct their miners to whatever network they see fit in the same way that they are free sell/buy whatever coins they wish.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:24:11
What are you even talking about? This sub has turned into nothing but crackpots. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:52:47
The price keeps going up because moar people r buying and moar people r buying cuz teh price is going up.
Why can't you understand that?????!!!!11
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:32:52
I don't think that's a bad strategy. I think it will depend on a number of factors...will the central banks let interest rates rise? Unlikely, imo, but if they do the lack of cheap credit will be painful for businesses and we could see prolonged unemployment/depressed wages. Less disposable income to invest all around means not as much flowing into crypto possibly. Time will tell I guess.
