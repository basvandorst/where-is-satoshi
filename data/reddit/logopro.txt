* I've never heard of "Western Union" - I use bitcoin a lot though.
* Bitcoin also has an app. many apps in fact.
* I guess...but I'd rather just have the low fee permanently than typing promo codes... which can also expire.
* It's as close to $0 as you can get. The 0.0001 btc miners fee ($0.04) really isn't something to care about. I'd be more worried about the "Western Union makes money from currency exchange" part on the left.
* Yep, standard bitcoin, that low fee isn't even a special. That just makes bitcoin even better.
* well unlike banks where you move too much money and you get calls, or they limit you, bitcoin really doesn't have any limits - you can move as many bitcoin as you wish as many times as you want.

But why should I keep track of what people do with the pogs I'm selling in the first place?
Dollars are "actual government money" and if people buy pogs from me I don't need to know their name, I don't need to perform "checks" ?
So If people don't need to perform checks when trading something (pogs/apples/whatever) for Government money, why should they perform checks for bitcoin?
What's the difference between an apple, a pog, and a bitcoin?
If people suddenly started to trade apples for drugs, does that mean all farmers markets will need to give checks to people who want to buy an apple?

Soon these anti-bitcoin banks will have no customers left as more and more merchants &amp; people start accepting and using bitcoin.

Obviously the person must be tricked into using the rigged wifi mini internet, but if there aren't other options available it could theoretically be done, right?

if you only use 1 address, when sending a payment, you need to wait for your "change" to confirm again before being able to spend again.
That's the only one I can think of.
Most people have more addresses though, so you can spend multiple times if you have many addresses with coin in them (though that is hidden behind the GUI's)

@_date: 2013-11-17 03:12:50
if you have a porn site already, go ahead and support it - why NOT accept the extra revenue...especially how it's increasing in value lately - that $19 might turn into $80 pretty quickly.
If you don't have an established site yet though, I wouldn't recommend it, because like Kevin 'O Leary always says, as soon as you start to make money the bigger guys will squash you like the bug you are.
Maybe if you start small though, it could work?
Porn really is a driving factor, and is something Bitcoin needs to make more people buy/accept/spend it more often - why the hell would you use a credit card for porn when you could use bitcoin!

I work from home so I don't drive my car much anymore. my GF has a car.
I was thinking of selling my car and buying bitcoin - would prob be able to sell it for around $3000, so 6 extra BTC
Not sure if I really want to do that though.. It's tough!
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:10:41
Because in the beginning they were VERY abundant, and basically worthless.
People lost a lot of coins in the beginning because there was nothing to do with them (Formats/crash/sells PC/etc)
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:35:30
What about people like me... I tried mining it when it was only a year or so old but I couldn't really get much - got like 0.3 bitcoin or something and through a format lost it as well.
Now I'm told to pay $100 for a single coin? I've heard of people with thousands of coins.
Me putting in $100 per coin at this stage only enriches you guys already owning 1000+ BTC.
As much as I like bitcoin, it's just too late for many of us to actually buy into it
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:41:30
Why would somebody give you a bitcoin address that he doesn't own though, when expecting payment?

LOL! More like the dangers of FIAT in Swiss Banks..
This just in:
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:26:01
0.05c is not really a "fee" when you're transferring 1 bitcoin ($530)
Banks, paypal and other merchants don't charge a fixed fee, they want a % based fee. If they charge a 1% fee for $530, that's $5,30
With Bitcoin if you send $1 000 000 it would still be only 0.05c - How much would a 1% paypal fee be on that?
If the OP just added a 0.0001 fee it would be instant. we say "no fees" because you don't need to pay a bank a monthly fee, and 0.04c isn't really considered a fee in my books, that's practically free.

I can send money through a photo on facebook of someone holding up a QR Code, by snapping a pic of it using my phone.... instantly they receive it with minimal charge.
* Cash: Can't do it.
* Paypal: Expensive and takes days to get into bank, and can be frozen.
* Credit Card: Yeah, you try putting your credit card details on facebook for the whole world to see.
* SWIFT: OMG are you kidding me?
* Western Union: lolz..
* Gold: Not a chance.
Sending money through a photo - think about that for a second.

@_date: 2013-11-24 00:44:05
That is not a good idea, and will confuse people causing them to send 1btc instead of 0.001 btc.
mBTC is okay in my books, **but If it were up to me I'd just jump ahead and go straight to satoshi's.**
* 1 (1 Satoshi)
* 1,000 (1 Thousand Satoshi)
* 1,000,000 (1 Million Satoshi)
* 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion Satoshi)
It can't get easier than that - we can all handle large numbers.
Prices could be listed on websites as follows:
* 285 Satoshi
* 1500 Satoshi / 1.5K Satoshi
* 250,000 Satoshi
* 5.5 Million Satoshi
I honestly think this is the best system because we are used to this.

Wouldn't that spam the blockchain and make everything super slow or something?
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:23:16
Yeah, I wouldn't do that If I were you, you're gonna burn out a laptop before you reach even 0.01 coins.
It's too late to mine with even powerful GPU's, never mind laptops.
Just buy some and save your hardware, it's not gonna be worth it for you.
I mean, isn't it better to just buy some now with your money, while the price is low? By the time you realize how much money you've spent on power the price will be $200 higher, which means you have to pay the power bill AND the extra $200 per coin (and possibly a new laptop)
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:04:32
Well he can't really reverse a bitcoin transaction, so I dunno?
Just meet in public, and make sure you get a few confirmations (at least 6 if it's a lot of BTC)
keep your eye's open and look out for anything suspicious, then you would be fine.
Edit: And makes sure he sends the BTC to your account as normal, and not "give you ownership" of his blockchain account or something like that.
Let us know how it goes!

You can still have charbacks with a 3rd party, but at least nobody is FORCED into a system with a mandatory chargeback system.
I design logos and have started to accept bitcoin for this reason.
Nobody has ever done a chargeback on my paypal, but it's a fear of mine that they do that after they receive the logo source files (and get my account frozen or something!)
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:32:39
Just log in to your account and you should be able to extract it, if it's still there.

"Bitcoin does not have any intrinsic value"
I LOL every time I hear this... just because it's digital and you can't hold a bitcoin doesn't mean it's worthless... mp3's are digital.... is iTunes worthless?

I'd say bitcoin has many functions and can do a lot of things other currencies or gold simply can't.

@_date: 2013-11-24 19:12:58
Man I wish I knew about Bitcoin at age 15...
You buy one and you can hold for AT LEAST 5 more years, then you're 20.
To explain what I mean, if bitcoin goes to 0 he still has his whole life ahead of him - also, he doesn't NEED to cash out for a house/car/wife/kids/etc right now, so it's easier to hold.
Buy a bitcoin wdornbach, and hold it till you're 20.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:44:49
I did. I'll post what happened soon.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:55:26
Because of first mover advantage, people have started accepting bitcoin. Exchanges, Blockchain websites, Mobile Apps and payment systems have been designed around it. It's built a reputation and is more widely accepted and desired than all the others.
Nothing is stopping other alt currencies from achieving that, but I'd bet most people don't want to accept 35 different alt-coins.
Bitcoin is not expensive, more than half is already in the system (&gt;12 million) so $1000 per coin is not going to be the final price - it's actually cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:59:04
Why does currency need to be backed by anything? It just needs to have a hard limit and be able to fly around the globe quickly and cheaply.
Having it attached to something like gold just gives it an attack vector that can be shut down easily.
Also, who pays for the storage of all this gold? what about the security?
Can I come trade in my coins for gold somewhere? Who's going to melt it for me, or do they just chip off some piece by piece?
If we want gold we can buy them easily with bitcoin, we've already hit parity so that's not a problem. I don't see any people running to cash in their bitcoin for gold though...

Just remember, if bitcoin never existed, $100,000 would not be $100,000 in 10 years time - you would most likely need $200,000 to be the same value (Inflation)
Now, with bitcoin out of the bag and demand grows, FIAT get's more and more worthless as demand weakens.
Bitcoin can indeed go to $1,000,000 per coin, but won't necessarily mean the $1mil you understand today.

In the beginning us programmers are more focused about testing for bugs/etc, meaning, when he was mining, he wasn't really thinking whether they would all be worth millions and trying to archive every single wallet address - he was more focused on testing bugs/etc/etc.
I'm sure he has a lot, but I'm telling you, a lot of those very early coins are gone forever, by the thousands.

Yes but they aren't the only ones who can reverse a payment. This can happen anywhere.
* Bob uses Sally's credit card info to make a fraudulent purchase from Peter for $600.
* Peter sends the goods to Bob.
* Bank says Bob used fraud, and Peter needs to return the money.
Now, please tell me why Peter needs to be out $600 because Sally can't keep her Credit Card in her pants?
Why should Peter be held liable?
Shouldn't the bank be held liable for putting money in Peter's account that wasn't really there?
Shouldn't Sally be held liable for not securing her credit card details?

Isn't fraudulent money, stolen credit cards, counterfeit bills and chargebacks at fault here?
That has nothing to do with Bitcoin, that's problems FIAT, Banks and Credit Cards have.
If you used escrow to buy something on eBay, you would still have a problem of fake/chargeback/fraudulent/counterfeit money with Paypal, Credit cards and banks.... 
Not if you used bitcoin... it can't be faked or counterfeit, and it can't be reversed.

Bitcoin.org NEEDS to make it **clear** that MultiBit is for newbies, and that QT needs a 12GB blockchain download.
**The second thing that will automatically happen:**
Once people actually ACQUIRE bitcoin, they will look up the security themselves, depending on how much bitcoin they have. Faucet bitcoin does not need BIP Encryption for example.

2011 for me when it had risen to $30 a coin... I was watching the rise and thought it was insane..
I mined a total of 0.13 BTC.
I wanted to sell my car for around $3000 and buy in (I don't drive anymore, work from home), but after the crash I had to move and life got in the way, and I kind of forgot about bitcoin.
I got back in since November 2013.
Man, If for some fluke I really did go through with buying $3000 worth of bitcoin back then, well, I would be very rich today.
At least I'm not suicidal about it like many other folks I've heard about, it's still early and I'm working my way up to 3BTC now.
**At least I have an early "Anchor Point" now - many people might discover bitcoin today, but won't do anything about it until they revisit in a year or two - I think a lot of people NEED to go through this before getting into it.**

I'm pretty sure there is a damn well couple of hundred thousand bitcoins that have been lost during the last 4 years.
21 Million coins.
The last 1 million will take 100 years.
~500,000 lost already by very early adopters in 2009
~500,000 might never move, and only be sold behind closed curtains when moving wealth. (Meaning, the same effect as a lost wallet)
~100,000 seized.
And in the next 40 years, some people might die with brain wallets or well hidden/buried paper wallets.
Don't forget coins lost by n00bs with no backups. or Physical coins that will never be opened to preserve collector value....
When trying to calculate how many bitcoins there are for each person 40 years from now, don't start by dividing 21 million, it's more like 18 million. We will never reach 21 million.

The price drops when a person wants to cash out quickly and doesn't care whether he gets $1100, $1050 or $1000... he then eats up all the buyers' offers.
If nobody else tries to sell for cheaper though (in competition to the person "cashing out"), then the price will remain the same, and only a few people would have bought some coins for a slightly better price.
In simple terms:
* If many people want to sell, the price goes down.
* If many people want to buy, the price goes up.

Yes that can happen. People might not panic though and then the person who sold gets burned.... that's trading.
I'm specifically referring to large players "cashing out".
If the market dips when a person is just trying to get rid of coins, it's good for buyers, and it's good for us in the long run, it's good for future stability, and is good for the person cashing out as well.
The only people who are negatively affected (temporarily) are other people who wanted to sell at the same time the whale cashed out (if they feel they need to lower their prices).. or n00bs who panicked and sold.

This is why I believe in Bitcoin... Satoshi planned everything, wrote the whitepaper and did a huge chunk of initial coding. I'm sure he didn't do it willy nilly, I think he spent a lot of time planning properly. He's a smart guy.
If anyone is throwing ideas around randomly it's all these other crapcoins every 5 minutes "Hey mine does this faster" "Hey I have lucky blocks!"
Double spend is not an issue, if someone is buying a $1000 Flatscreen, sure, wait for 4 or 5 confirmations - but for a subway sandwich you don't need to worry about that many at all.
If Subway get ripped off $2 by only waiting for 2 confirmations, they could go to 3.... if it happens again, how is 4? But until that happens there is no need to worry about losing $2. I'm sure the cut VISA takes from their profit is higher than $2 as well...a lot bigger.
It's really a non-issue. =)

When you buy bitcoin, you are technically TAKING AWAY bitcoin out of the economy and therefore there is less out there for bad players.
You aren't funding anyone/anything - you take a bitcoin from someone and he takes your money - your money doesn't go anywhere else.

I like flowers as much as the next guy, but somehow I think putting all my Bitcoin into Peercoin just to "save the environment" is not really going to do it.
The environment angle is not enough to convince me, especially when the system has inflation and is designed to give even more coins to early adopters on a monthly bases... that sounds like a bank.

My GF has the Blockchain App on her iPhone, which was pretty awesome when I transferred some coin to her.
It can generate a QR code, and you can even e-mail your Bitcoin address to someone (along with some other ways of sending) right inside the App.
You can also type in exactly how many dollars worth of bitcoin you want to receive, and it will generate a QR code with all that information - the guy you're meeting will scan it and should just hit send after verifying the amount.
I'd send the bitcoin to MultiBit on your PC when you get home though, I'm still not sure whether her Blockchain App keeps the bitcoin on her phone or on the blockchain server (I guess not though, We didn't sign up for an account, just a password and captcha was needed)
It takes only like 5-10 seconds to register the payment on the App, but I'd wait for 2 or 3 confirmations if you are afraid. I personally trust Bitcoin a lot though, I'm not really phased by amount of confirmations - i'll just use it for HUGE amounts.

Well I haven't used them, but I assume this is the angle:
* 1. You deposit money for 1 Bitcoin
* 2. They tell you you need to wait a few days for the transaction.
Now, this is when they take one of their own bitcoin, and "assign" it to your transaction, in a matter of speaking.
Now, when the waiting period is over, one of two things happen:
* 1. if Bitcoin is worth less, they give it to you.
* 2. if Bitcoin is worth more, they rather keep it and tell you it was because of "High Risk".
I'm not sure if this is really the case, I'm just speculating, because this is indeed something that could be done when waiting periods are in use.

Maybe there is a conflict with the newer versions, meaning it isn't backwards compatible?
* Step 1: RAR up all your bitcoin files, especially the wallet files. (In that Appdata dir) - Back 'em up now.
* Step 2: install the version that came out when you mined (Check the version release dates) and then try again using your backed up wallet.
That's what I'd try first.

It just seems like a "fee" to you because you want to "transfer" $0.08c..... the whole network must now update your 0.08c transfer.
To a person sending $1000 or $100,000 around, 8c is not really considered a "fee" (1% of total transaction like paypal/etc do, is.)
You *can* theoretically sent it for $0,00c but it might take longer as your transaction is of lower importance, and therefore some clients/websites include the 8c as default so that n00b users don't get their transactions stuck in limbo for too long.
Over time the fee will go from 0.0001 btc to 0.00005, 0.000001, etc

While he may not have "inside information", I'm sure what he said is indeed the case.
They're not afraid yet, but I'm sure they know about bitcoin and are weary. surely they are at least considering their options on combating bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the purest form of money, not controlled, artificially regulated or increased at will, and fee's cost the least amount possible.
I'd be shocked if they are not at least considering a counter of some sorts.

If someone wants to try that, let them go for it.
If you *want* to drive the price down, that means you must sell all your coins to low offers. If it creates panic, you might be able to buy back at a lower price.
If it backfires though, and nobody else sells for lower... then you've just sold your own coins away for cheap, and then have to pay the normal "high price" again if you want to buy back.

It's like this, say I'm a farmer selling oranges. You ask me what the current price is, and I say "$10 per box". You then say you want to buy 5 boxes for $50. I take your deposit and tell you i'm only getting new stock in a week and you have to wait. You agree.
A week passes, and when you want to pick up the oranges one of two things happen:
* 1. Prices have decreased to $8 - I say "there is your 5 boxes, thank you."
* 2. Price increase to $12, and I say "Yeah sorry, the bank told me the cheque could bounce, so I didn't deposit it. oh, and the price is $12 per box now."

* 1. People who are rich don't want others to mess with their money.
* 2. Bitcoin has made some people very rich.
* 3. Most of these now rich people are probably early adopters, and some of them are probably highly versed in TOR, and probably traded on Silk Road often.
* 4. Apparently you can hire Boba Fett on TOR.
I'm sure you can see where i'm going with this....

You probably haven't loaned money before have you? 10% isn't really a lot, people who buy cars/houses really pay a lot more than 10% extra in the end.
BTC lending will be no different than FIAT lending.
Right now it might be dangerous to borrow 1BTC, spend it, and then have to give 1BTC back - but in the future bitcoin will be a lot more stable, with a bigger market cap.

Edit: this post was a joke.
An asshole of a guy spells it "Bit-Coins" (Yes, a hyphen, a capital C, and an s at the end) and implies bitcoin is fake money, who then sells what he calls a "voucher" for a measly 15 bucks and then is oblivious to what it's worth today. Didn't anyone realise the post was written in jest?

It's is what it is. The market is what it is, and people do what people do.
Who are you to tell them when to exchange their money? Should everybody just hold, forever? Everyone has a point where they cash out, deal with it. To a person who bought in at $8, $800 is a good return.
If everybody held, it would be scarce, yes, but it would really be worthless as well - just 10000 people holding different numbers in some Windows Program.
The value comes from moving it around - it has no value if it just stagnates.
100 people could own all 21 million coins, that doesn't mean it would have value. If all 100 people hold their coins it's worthless.
Bitcoin's value comes from being a vehicle for trading/exchanging on a global scale.

Your post was "Will Bitcoin cost $1,000 someday?"
Sure there might be some person out there in the middle of Antarctica that is willing to sell for $700, but if you want to buy from the exchanges, a bitcoin is definitely going to cost you that $1000.
If the price is $1000, Why would anyone sell for $800 or $900 when they can get $1000?

I've been thinking of flaws myself, I mean, surely there must be one leak, right? Well, then I thought, there are much smarter people than me, and if the system can be broken, it would have been broken by now, as there is much to be gained.

The private keys are stored in your wallet files. don't worry about it too much, just add some password encryption to your wallet (in multibit) so that if someone stole your wallet files, they can't do anything unless they have the password to decrypt it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:11:14


* That's debatable, there is only a certain amount, and Bitcoin does some pretty cool things other currencies just cannot compete with. If it were $8 for 1million satoshi's would you say the same? Where the comma lies between the zero's is irrelevant.


* For now.... and there are a lot more than a year ago. Did you think everyone is going to accept a new technology from the get go? You don't seem to understand that adoption takes time. Bitcoin is doing a good job at adoption rates, actually.


* For now... in 5 years you might not want to convert to dollars anyway. Holding bitcoin is in your best interest in any case... later you will have your ATM should you want to use it.


* For now... again, the systems are coming. why don't you understand everything doesn't happen instantly?


* For now... should all companies pay their employees in bitcoin at this moment in time? of course not. (I accept bitcoin for my logo work though)


* So is paypal, but it's the only way for a lot of people to send money over the internet.... Or do you throw FIAT at your computer screen?


* They said that in 2010 as well - the people who bought bitcoin are rich now, and can fly into space with just over 300 bitcoins.


* Just like BitTorrent.... that shut down too, right guys? right guys? hello?


* [Yep, very hard to send money!]( As for 14 minute delays? just add a few cents more into your fee if high priority. mine works instantly.


* Escrow can be built on top of services. having the choice is a good thing.


* For now, yes - check again in 5 years. When we can buy McDonalds at the drive through by simply scanning a barcode on an LCD, we will use it, instead of hoping the attendant doesn't steal your Credit card CCV number while cloning it.


* You should look up the environmental damage gold mining causes and costs us all.
You seem to blame bitcoin for not having all system in place instantly... what kind of reasoning is that? Learn how adoption rates work. Also learn about supply and demand and then you will also realize that $800 is nothing in the bigger scheme of things.
Edit: Thanks for the gold, anonymous donor. =P

It's just fun. As long as you don't bet your bitcoin life savings, why not?
Day Trading is risky if you don't know what you're doing, and gambling in vegas is also just as risky... at least I know it's not rigged, and I can set my odds how I want them.
If you only play once or twice (Best advice, long term you WILL lose) then just set it on a HIGH CHANCE of winning, and bet a little more than the minimum so you can make something back at least. chances are you would most likely win. Just don't push your luck and do it repeatedly, lol.

I have never used a blockchain.info wallet before, so I don't know whether it has it's fee's built-in or not (MultiBit does) BUT I know that you need to include at least 0.0001 Bitcoin at this time to get the miners moving, else you fall in the back of the queue with the other freeloaders.
The fee is really only $0.04 which is tame compared to western union/paypal/etc.
Try sending a small amount to another wallet, and include a small fee (0.0001 btc) and see how it goes... I'm sure you will change your mind.
Paypal takes 5 days to transfer money to my bank account (7 if it's over a weekend, because as we all know, Computers need some rest too)

**Option 1 - Pay wish cash:**
* You spend $30 purchasing a game. nothing gained, nothing lost.
**Option 2 - Pay with Bitcoin:**
* Buy $30 worth of bitcoin.
* Buy the game with your $30 worth of bitcoin.
* You probably gained 0.00172 BTC because that $30 turned into $31,21 while you were trying to purchase your game.
* You probably also got a discount for using bitcoin. Win again!
* You're stimulating the Bitcoin economy, further increasing your other bitcoins. Tripple Win.
On the other hand, if bitcoin is dropping in price, you have even more incentive to spend BTC.
You then replace that bitcoin, and you have now gained more btc than you originally had because you bought new replacement coins at a lower price.

That's a good idea. move to mBTC and then later to µBTC.
So when will we be able to set the Multibit client GUI to display in mBTC?
I think a lot more users will love seeing 13'200 mBTC in their account than 0.0132
I'm sure more people would buy Bitcoin as well, instead of thinking BTC is too expensive because they can only buy 0.2 of a coin or whatever, they will see a value of 200 mBTC instead, which seems like a lot more.

**The Bitcoin community should really focus on doing this.**
Yes, we need more exchanges and merchants/etc/etc - BUT the issue the OP is talking about is REAL, and will affect market adoption if we don't get this sorted.
Apps, exchanges, commerce websites and Bitcoin Client GUI's **need** to start at least supporting mBTC.
1 mBit for $1, or 100 000 Satoshi for $1 sounds a lot better than $1000 for 1 bitcoin.
$1000 for 1 bitcoin sounds like an expensive collectible gold coin or something, and not a currency... this misleads the point of it all, and the fact that it's "virtual" and you can't really hold it, sounds really dodgy if you didn't know any better.
"Sure, I'd like to spend $1000 on one virtual coin that I can't physically hold, created by some unknown hacker. Yeah right!"
If we want this to be a currency, we need to get off the 0.001 system when we hit $1/1 mBTC parity.

If we use mBTC (1000 milliBTC = 1 BTC) it's easy to understand prices easily (If merchants support displaying it in mBTC), and it will seem less expensive for buyers.
I just want MultiBit to be able to support displaying my total BTC in mBTC, so instead of seeing 0.0011 BTC I will see 11 mBTC

I was playing PrimeDice and after cashing out some of my money, MY BETTING ODDS of 90% were changed to 50/50 without telling me!
I saw 3 losses in a row and placed a max bet thinking it was 90/10. I lost it all because it was a fucking 50/50 shot.
PRIME DICE you guys scammed me by changing my settings behind my back!!

Start a small store where you can buy groceries with bitcoin and grow from there. I don't think you need any licences as you're not exchanging money for bitcoin.
Accept bitcoin and convert to $ yourself, to buy more stock when you need.
Or do a Bitcoin ATM.
These are the things we NEED - stuff we can buy with bitcoin in our average, boring daily lives - or a way to draw cash and buy them somewhere else that doesn't accept bitcoin yet.

Let me do what I want with my bitcoin!
For the most part I save mine, some I've cashed out, others I've gambled away, others I have given away.

But if you're selling 100 coins for $1000 for example, sure, there might be buyers offering $1000 (even a fake you)... but if there are buyers offering $1001, or $1010, or $1100, then the coins will be sold to them first. isn't that so?
Trading happens when highest bid meets lowest offer, does it not... you don't "choose" who you sell to/buy from.

Market crashes has no "function"
Also, If the "weak" (or anyone else) refuse to sell, the prices don't go down, they go up.

Who gives a shit about Ripple, they shouldn't even be there.
Also, I don't care what the US Government thinks about Bitcoin, Bitcoin is much bigger than USA.

If they taint money involved with drugs/etc, then the money they seize will always be worthless.
Silkroad money? Worthless now.

I sold a guy $770 worth of bitcoins at my home - he left before even 1 confirmation (In fact, it only came like 2 hours later)
I had only met him that day.
A Large supermarket chain isn't going to worry about a person buying $100 worth of groceries... credit card fraud is much higher than bitcoin, with bitcoin it is pretty much impossible unless you own 51% of the hashing power.
