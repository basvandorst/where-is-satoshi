You can't conflate the value of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with that of their competitors. It really doesn't matter how many new cryptocurrency projects come out, especially since Bitcoin is the first mover and is likely to dominate the space. Assuming something like Dogecoin is around 5 years from now, you would have a hard time finding someone willing to accept it as payment.
As a result, they don't *collectively* become a fiat currency. I would agree that strictly monetary blockchains like Bitcoin would be a form of fiat currency (or better yet, they could be described as a highly liquid commodity), even one with several distinct disadvantages. Insofar as you consider a "currency" as something that functions as (1) a unit of account, (2) a store of value, and (3) a medium of exchange, I would argue that Bitcoin functions poorly for (1) and (2), since its value is vulnerable to wild market fluctuations (although this may be moderated in the future). The value-add comes in the form of (3), because it removes the need for an intermediate bank in a whole range of transaction types, especially wire transfers.
This isn't even considering other highly innovative coins that function as platforms for smart contracts and dapps, which facilitate (3) to an extent much more difficult in the world of traditional paper currencies, in addition to offering potential for a wide range of non-monetary uses.
Also consider something like gold, the value of which is almost completely based off of perception. Intrinsic uses for it have only been developed somewhat recently, and its enduring value over time shows that "fiat" currencies don't have as big a fundamental weakness as everyone tends to assume.
TL;DR Cryptocurrencies fill a very important niche as a medium of exchange and beyond, and this is their basic value-add. The value of major cryptocurrencies should not be conflated with that of the legions of shitcoins.
