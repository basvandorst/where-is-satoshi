Have these cancellations ever happened to any customers when the BTC price decreased over the ACH hold period?

that was my major issue, that I was warned 8 minutes before I was expecting them...and it was only 10 BTC, but still it was going to take a few more days to be refunded.  Not a good look.. but yeah it's hard for me to be mad now since they solved it all up for me so fast.

coinbase was working good, but just cancelled my third order and called it a 'high risk' transaction
On Feb 5, 2013 you purchased 10.00 BTC via bank transfer for $214.07.
Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel this order because it appears to be high risk. We do not send out any bitcoins on high risk transactions, and you will receive a refund to your bank account in 3-4 business days.
Please understand that we do this to keep the community safe and avoid fraudulent transactions. Apologies if you are one of the good users who gets caught up in this preventitive measure - we don't get it right 100% of the time, but we need to be cautious when it comes to preventing fraud.
You may have more luck trying again in a few weeks. Best of luck and thank you for trying Coinbase.

Hello Fred, 
can you explain what your fraud algorithms are tripping on, so we can minimize the frustration with coinbase?  My third order was just cancelled, 8 MINUTES before it was due.  Is that normal?  Is there an explanation?  My money was held for a week, and now will take 3-4 more days to be refunded?  I have two more orders in the pipeline, will they be flagged as well?  Can you guarantee these last minute cancellations have nothing to do with the BTC spot price?

Hmm my bank is a major one

If the ACH transfer went thru, what fraud are they stopping by cancelling the order 8 minutes before it was supposed to post?
@_date: 2013-02-12 15:38:51
Word.  Turns out you are right.  Their customer service is much better than my bank.  :)

It ended happily, I'm happily surprised.

Yeah I'm not sure how their algorithm flagged me, but Fred (or his elves) did fix my issue in the middle of the night.  I had been transferring all my coin out of coinbase after buying them, so maybe that was the issue.  I was taking them and putting them on my desktop wallet, just to test things.. I put some back into coinbase thinking it would help, possibly somebody who buys but keeps zero balance is a flag?  That's all I could come up with

Yeah, I think it would go a long way if they could flag sooner, if they think its 'high risk'.  I don't know what could change in those last days unless the ACH took too long too transfer.. but even then they could just delay the order to clear their comfort period instead of cancelling

Thanks!  Around 3AM last night Fred pushed my transaction through :)
