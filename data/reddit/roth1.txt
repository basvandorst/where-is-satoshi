Also remember this fits standard model for a bear trap after the last bubble crash.

Confirmation time is something that's also worth looking into.

The thing is, right now it's in a highly speculative situation with most investors. The current businesses that accept them are great, but not the type of power hitters that would legitimize it. The second that Amazon decides to accept it as a form of payment is the second that bitcoin is seen as legitimate to prospective investors.

I actually live very close to that address. Is there any way for us to pinpoint exactly where it's coming from?

If JPMorgan was really worried about bitcoin they could invalidate the currency with about 250 milion dollars worth of hardware (this is assuming retail cost, which is likely much, much less). Considering they're a 2.5 trillion dollar company that would be more than feasible for them.

A very quick one though. All it takes is changing the cgminer config file. 
Also, you could easily contract out Intel or AMD in order to produce the chips (that's what BFL does, but they use a smaller company). Also, considering they're buying in extreme bulk the price would be close to 250 million dollars, which I'm basing off of the retail value of BFL's monarch without any sort of bulk discount. They just need to get to 50+% which at this point and time is 16035 TH/s (32,070TH/s total). Assuming the difficulty even triples by the time they can get to it, they only need roughly 50,000TH/s, which at retail value would be 183 million dollars worth of cards.
