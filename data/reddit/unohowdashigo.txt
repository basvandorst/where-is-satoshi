okay so i am going to ask the gambling site if they can give me the full address.
i dont understand how this could happen.  is it because i didn't fully let the wallet sync up before getting a receiving address?
Something isn't making sense.
Either that, or copying the file to my external fucked up(but everyone is saying it shouldnt matter even if we werent synced up)
or they didn't send the BTC at all..

any follow up help?
I'm really not understanding this shit.. kinda annoying me.. no, yes it is annoying me

cuz im a fucking idiot
my computer was running like shit and someone has been trying to get into my wifi so i took precautions in case.

To be clear on everything that is going on.
So just move the external wallet.dat (the backup) to my computer.. and delete my current wallet.dat (has no BTC on it)
Though, my concern is... i already moved all of it over to my computers harddrive which is how i downloaded it.  i never redownloaded from the site, i just used the external to DL

when i first got bitcoin core i made a receiving address from bitcoin core.

but it wasnt done synchronizing when i backed it up.
But i completely copy and pasted the bitcoin files into my external..
took those same files and re downloaded.  it start the synch from scratch
Am i shit out of luck here or do i have a chance to regain the btc back?

Well, i did put the entire bitcoin file on my external.
I do see "wallet.dat"
But would this work even if I didn't have the entire bitcoincore DL'd
Essentially, I dont think i properly "backed" it up.
I really just took the file and copied it to my HD external

Lol are you serious ?
And it's all DL'd now..
No i did no encrypt it

the receiving address isn't the same, unfortunately.
What do you mean by check the website blockchain.info that btc is in it? Sorry, I don't fully understand...
I consulted with the gambling website and they sent me the receiving address with some stars and the last 4 digits exposed but they aren't the same.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:55:57
yeah i completely wiped it.
either way it was only $90 worth and BTC was at 4000 on the day they sent me the BTC so technically i would have $200+ and now its literally lost on the interwebs for eternityyy

I see "blocks" folder.. and there are a bunch of files that read "blk000xx.dat" from the date of the transaction
as well as a bunch of LDB files from the index from the date of transaction
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:41:42
i transfered over the old wallet...
i dont see an option for "open command window"
Can i enter that command through bitcoin core itself in their command prompt?

i honestly really messed up.  I'm looking at this as a learning situation.  Now i learned the hardest way that i need to backup and not be flimsy with my cyrptos.

well fuck me.
thanks though.
