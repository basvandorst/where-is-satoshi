C:\Users\Owner&gt;c:\Python27\python c:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfo
lder\ --dumpwallet --password=
WARNING:root:pycrypto or libssl not found, decryption may be slow
ERROR:root:wrong password
does this mean my password is wrong or could it be something else? If I didn't save my correct password can I still recover it? Thanks!

Yes my wallet was encrypted through the menu in the bitcoin app.
ok, tried the first option, got 'pywallet.py: error: no such option: --password'. Did I paste my key right in the right place in the command? I typed - c:\Python27\python c:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfolder\ --dumpwallet --password=
on the second one, replaced the wallet.dat and launched the app, this time when it loaded it said 'error, wallet corrupted' which is an improvement from before as previously it didn't even say that.
Last option gave the 'not recognized as an internal or external command etc.
Any other ideas? Thanks for taking so much time to help with this, if we figure this out I'll definitely send you 1 bitcoin not .5

Thanks, when I type that it produces a long stream of text in the ms-dos prompt, and places 6 files in the \yourbkpfolder\ , labelled _db (type 001 Archive) then '_db.002' (type) 002 File , and so on up to _db.006 (type 006 file) but nothing in the pywallet file, how do I get it to change it into a wallet.dat file? thanks
