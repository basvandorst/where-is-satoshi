Coin Base easiest way

I suggest against this because Paypal won't cover you.

I'm new to bit coin and few days ago it was $490 and I was still educating myself on bit coin. I see it now at $560 and I regret not buying :(. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:33:38
Yeah I know. But I have read up a lot on bit coin and have bought just a little bit to play around with so I know how they work.

$10, I didn't take the take time to understand what Bitcoin was. I just remember it being the currency used for Silk Road, when I heard stories about the Deep Web.

Thanks for sharing your story. I remember first hearing about bitcoin in 2012 when I heard about the deep web. I didn't think much of it, except that it was just a digital currency. If only I had researched it, just like I do with everything else. But oh well, I am a holder :)

Okay I'm late into the game and knew about bit coin 2 years ago from stories about the silk road. But I never looked into it until last week and bought a little bit from coin base to see how it works.

@_date: 2014-05-25 05:35:36
I agree $70 is not much is the grand scheme of it. But still it would have been nice since I now know how bit coins work. :)
