Sadly I think the latter of the options is the most likely outcome here, every day I wake up and think something major has happened, it's currently 3.30am, I keep waking up around this time, to check my coins, usually with  nervous intrepidation that I'm going to see 100% drops in value across the entire crypto multiverse.

Noooo! Don't be silly, Bitcoin Cash correction currently in progress, back to its true value of $300, BTC $30k by Christmas.

Ugh! "I'm seriously thinking about putting everything I have into it" - I've uttered those words at one point.

It's given me a great idea. Sell old hard drives at car boot sales with stickers attached that say '1000 BTC - Don't toss' - probably get $100 per drive if you get some half wit to sell them and explain that there's some type of 'money' on it, hence the $100 price tag.

Hang on, who's mom knows what BTC stands for..? i'm calling bullshit on this one, unless mom is familiar with CryptoCurrency trading its not going to mean anything.

This is true for many of us I think, a year ago i was scraping a living each month, but now i'm pretty comfortable with disposable income, from trading crypto, each week i syphon my profit off in btc to a holding account where it matures and I can buy stuff i need, bought a gaming PC last week and paid with BTC.

Probably service on all of them, mobile internet in Asia is ridiculously fast and super cheap.

I was in HK in the summer, a taxi driver had a similar setup, but only 4 phones, all running this app. I tried to ask what it was, but he didn't speak enough English to tell me, my Chinese is a little rusty so we just agreed on Angry Birds tactics I think.

After two months of Crypto I too have learned to not 'hodl' on to a sinking ship, sell when it's going down and buy back in at the bottom instead. Bought an absolute shit load of LTC at 0.013, now it's just a waiting game for the max profit.

Haha that was my goal too when I started, I wanted a nearly new Audi Allroad, however I ended up with up with a 7yr old one, it's still a great car and I'm happy with it, but I wanted bluetooth MMI and all the toys. I just need to change the way I trade in the future, I find holding much more difficult than I ever imagined, bittrex doesn't help as it shows all the percentage rises of all the other coins I could be making money on.

My portfolio is currently down 80% in a week, but that's just due to me being a dick about it and not taking it seriously enough. I placed a buy order, it executed at the correct rate, now the coin has lost about 60% of its value. It'll go back up eventually but it is a little worrying as it's sitting at $8000 less than a week ago.
