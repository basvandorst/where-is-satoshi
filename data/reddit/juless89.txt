Well yes, this would also be true for people who are against SegWit. However, what reason do people have to keep the nodes after SegWit gets locked in?

You can do this at Bitcoin exchanges like:
 or 
I should warn you that Mt. Gox is known for long withdrawal duration, hence the higher USD price per Bitcoin.

I use Bitconium for android, this app allows me to set upper and lower thresholds for the most used exchanges.

Play around on  to estimate possible earning, this site accounts for difficulty increase.

Yes that is true for today's value, however given the huge potential of Bitcoin the payout can be much bigger. I do agree that a bot would be awesome

Bitcoin is currently a high risk investments, this means that the potential payout is also really high. The most important thing is that you do not invest anymore than you are willing to loose.

I often send 0.01BTC to potential newcomers to encourage them to get into Bitcoin, thus far I have only paid 0.0001 BTC  (~3 cents) per transaction.

China does not care.

Yes indeed as is saying, it is rather difficult to convert yuan back into USD. However, imagine you run a webshop and you import goods from China, than it would be profitable to buy BTC cheap and transfer these to China to sell high. Then you use the yuan to ship goods back to where you live.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a huge growth potential, even if you buy in at this moment. One could argue that cryptocurrencies will be the future. Bitcoin is currently the biggest of them all, however that does not guarantee that Bitcoin will still be the  cryptocurrency in the future. 
Basically when you invest in Bitcoin you take a huge amount of risk for a really big payoff. So the most important thing is that you are willing to loose everything you invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

The value is rising a lot more slowly than compared to earlier this week, I do except a small correction when the $1000 mark is reached. Just not the same crash like on monday.
However this is bitcoin and well know for sure after.

I see, thank you. To my understanding the main reason for the price parity between exchanges was caused because of the difficulty to get funds out of both Mt. Gox and BTCchina as non local users. 
I do not know if this has changed? If not than why are the prices much closer now?

It is also important to consider that there are also countries with currencies even more unstable than Bitcoin, there are also multiple countries that lack a good financial system. I believe Kenya in Africa is an example of that.

Figure out for yourself which exchange you want to use and make an account, and deal with any possible verification documents and deposit the amount you wish to invest.
This way when you feel the time is right, you will already have everything in place.

You can trade BTC/USD for LTC on  depending on where you live you can either deposit USD on  and acquire LTC directly or buy your BTC from a local exchange and send them to  to convert them to LTC.
