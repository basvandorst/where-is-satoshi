Did they confiscate your bitcoin that you have on Coinbase?

You need to call this guy/gal out.  If he is bold enough to message you with his/her screen name than you should not bother to protect this person.  That way we can send him a spelling application....
Edit:  Just read his response.  Whatever dude.

Has the been sent to him by other venues or is it just posted.  I am just trying to determine if he will ever read this.

I live in Wisconsin.  Every day I see commercials on TV here from the State of New York aimed at business to go set up shop in New York.  These Virtual Currencies regulations discussed fly counter to the "good spirit and good business" aspect of those commercials.  They talk about less regulation and less bureaucratic hassels.   Right.  Tell me, if a company relocates to New York, can they be exempt from these regulations should the accept bitcoin?  YOU DO NOT CONTROL MY BITCOIN. EVER.

Interesting that the banking community is filled with criminals and nobody seems to care at all.
