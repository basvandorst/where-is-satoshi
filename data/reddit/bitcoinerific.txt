Translation: Ethereum hasn't released the source code for their UI yet, Counterparty programmers are ready to type "Ctrl-C Ctrl-V" as soon as they do.

No worries, I'm sure the counterparty team will copy &amp; paste all the source code from the ISIS git repo.

I'll just go out and say what no one else is saying: Bitcoin is starting to make inroads into the street-level drug market. If you spend any time watching a BTM these days in a big city, you'll come to this conclusion pretty quickly.
Mike Tyson, for better or worse, is very appealing for this demographic.

So, it seems to me there is an easier way to get a similar end result:
1. Buy 3 plug PCs like this one: 
2. Place them randomly in some discreet, public wall sockets in your home town, in places where they can reach two separate public wifi hotspots. Each of these devices will function as a ad-hoc "bridge" between these two networks.
3. Chain all three devices together as a VPN.
4. If power goes off on one of the three plugs (or if the accelerometer detects motion) treat it as compromized and add a new plug at a new location.
It you place such a device in an arbitrary public wall socket somewhere, I suspect the odds are &gt;50% they will remain undisturbed. Employees in stores would probably assume the plug has some legitimate purpose.
