Your thought process is flawed. You're implying it's okay to steal from a designer because he wasn't going to get rich off of it anyways. So who cares if his/her product is stolen. Sure the company employing the designer is the one who will get rich off of it. With your current thought process. It's okay to steal an artists music because it's the record label who is really making the money. The artist shouldn't care about putting in the time and effort. The record label should be the only ones who care. You don't see the disconnect there?

A big part of a product like watches, clothes and other accessories is the design. Something a person or team of people spent a lot of time, effort and money to create. It is not easy nor cheap to be original. Then some other company comes in. Putting in little to no effort, time or money and copies it. Now they're pulling away some potential clients from the company which created the original. 
Edit: Analogy: You spent hours studying for a gruesome exam. You gave up hanging out at a really awesome party to study. Didn't get to see the new movie that came out. Haven't done anything but work your butt off. Then the exam comes. You're working hard to understand the questions and working through them. While next to you, a classmate is just looking at your exam and copying your answers. He doesn't really have all of the steps and it's not as well thought out. But he has the general information required. You end up getting an A and he ends up getting a B. You gave up a week or so of your life for this. He gave up nothing.

I like to give anyone the benefit of the doubt. But this is some next level bullshit. Then to have the balls to "whoopse" post here. As informational, using owning an exchange as their form of credibility. When their credibility is absolutely shot out the window once I saw uphold. Yikes. Why don't we just rotate whomever has the top comment for the week to be heads of exchanges. Then I can get my dank memes on the exchanges.

But we don't run an exchange. There is value in OP posting for anyone who doesn't know about Bitreserve/uphold. But he/she is an owner of an exchange with other people's money they are playing with. You're damn right I expect him/her to know about KNOWN scams. 
What if OP had said "lost all my clients money liquidating BTC to BCH" would you think differently? "I didn't know Roger Ver is a criminal, who has had a hand in MtGox." But if you don't know that, it's okay to make bad investments? This is blatantly not knowing the market when his/her business is knowing the market.

Thank you for sharing your vast knowledge regarding the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:29:44
I honestly am not sure. I am not super well versed in the blockchain. I am always trying to find other insight so I can research possibilities. Rip it apart and try to put it back together. I don't try to pretend to be an expert or even a novice in any of this. I'm honestly looking for those smarter than I to foster ideas.
I have never heard of Bloom. That's the kind of insight I was looking for. Here's blockchain technology which I was unaware of before you mentioning it. Now I have something to look in to and hopefully later bring back relevant knowledge I learned from my research. Thank you!

Necessary to expand the blockchain. What do we want? Cheaper and faster transactions. How are we going to get that? Specialized machines dedicated solely to a specific algorithm. ASICs were an inevitability.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:34:59
Very few care. I made a post a day or two ago. Looking to bring up a discussion of Equifax breach and how the blockchain could potentially help. According to that post, the "block chain" has narrow uses. Yikes. Might not be what people want to discuss. That's fine. But for the response to be "it has narrow uses" makes me sad for what the sub has become. Quite different than when I started here in 2014. New stupid money is awesome for business. Detrimental to this sub.

What is real money to you? Fiat currency we use daily? A Bit is worthless. A Dollar is worthless. Collectively there is an agreed upon value of each. Although a Dollar would be slightly more valuable objectively because you could burn it.

I hold alt coins because I believe the crypto market will boom. Whenever it actually becomes main stream. Prior to that, who has a better coin is basically a fools errand. We have no idea where this will settle in to the market. For all we know, Bitcoin isn't what it will be widely adopted for. And we get to see all of the bitcoin hard work turn in to a backend for legal dispensories. And that's it. I sure fucking hope not. But anything goes. 
I picked up the mainstream alt coins of this counterculture. As one of them are MOST likely to be adopted. There will not be 1000 cryptocurrency's widely accepted. There will be one major coin doing what major coins do. And alt coins will be the new way to get capital for startups. As well as companies own "coins" which have value only at their stores.  Basically the same as credit/gift cards.Plus uses not even thought up yet.
 This belief the blockchain will topple banks is a noble cause. Albeit pointless. At best the blockchain works alongside banks. There's a false belief everyone will buy in to the crypto idea. Because WE bought in. It would take some massive massive massive massive movement of money to kill banks. 
Step over to That "whole coin" idea is prevalent to the point of, "You can't get a whole bitcoin with the pace it's going. Why bother?" Uhh.. Because whatever $ you do have in it is growing that that "too fast" rate lol

I think the low price point has made Litecoin the "get in" coin. Because you need a whole coin, no? A LOT of belief it will boom like bitcoin. But as in infancy maybe a couple bucks bitcoin to 5k big. Literally at any/every movement up or down. I agree litecoin is undervalued. It isn't taking off unless everything else takes off. At which litecoin didn't boom. The crypto market did. But I'm sure there will be a plethora of "I told you it would happen." 's anyways.

True, best analogy here would be any idiots buying any L3+ anymore. If you didn't have it in your hands a month ago. You're not making money. But I don't blame Bitmain for still selling them. It's on the buyer to be informed. I blame Genesis because of their bullshit lifetime buzz word to catch people. Watch some genesis mining "it isn't a scam". They take you in to a spreadsheet and throw numbers at you. Annnnnnd you're at 100k by the end of the year with your initial 1k investment. 
Anyone can go buy in to genesis now and I hope you turn a profit. Same with the L3+. The question was posed. I gave an honest answer. And I don't think the answer is subjective. I brought empirical evidence from other sources who did go down that road. I have an L3+ and from my numbers. If you purchase it now. You lost most of your coin. I have had it for a month. I haven't turned a profit.

It's not the mods it's the community. And yes they can act like children. A common response I get if it's aboit blockchain, an alt coin or just not litecoin; "Can't you read?! You're in idiot." Ah. My bad, my bad. Thought you guys liked the blockchain too.

I won't try to repeat what has already been well written. [Here is the source](




My 2 cents on this, they can walk away at any time. Once there's no new money. They're gone. And with all your BTC, LTC, DASH, Monero or whatever. What are people going to do? Sue them? Yeah, okay. Totally wouldn't go somewhere cozy with some untold billions.

I really only follow BTC and LTC enough to have a grasp of the communities. I have a feeling smaller coins would be more friendly. As there's nothing heavy at stake. I just personally don't care to follow most coins. Crypto is all about social acceptance. BTC, LTC, ETH are basically die harder's. They aren't other options, they're the competition. I'm all game for some competition. Until reason and logic leave and X is perfect. Just because Charlie said so, or The Vlad guy for ETH I can never remember his name. Or Satoshi who says everything by saying nothing. And free lunch. And wants nothing to do with BTC. Everything has flaws. People need to stop following what a person or group says and actually read some shit.
I asked LTC a week or maybe a few back, when Equifax was more hot news. A broad "how could the blockchain solve this?". Just to drum up some intelligent conversation. Not to literally SOLVE the Equifax problem. Holy hell the responses I received. I felt like we were at Chuck-e-Cheese's and talking about arcade coins. One guy couldn't even get blockchain right. And devolved in to PM's about how many coins and money they had. Because I would be envious of arbitrary numbers from strangers or at all. Litecoinmining is more fun as there's people asking "should I buy 700,000$ worth of LTC's?" At full price. For whatever shipment Bitmain is on. Reddit, perfect place for near million dollar investment advice. After poking, he had NO idea ANYTHING about mining or crypto. Whether he had 700k? Who knows. I don't put it past people.
There's a lot of *read the title of a Reddit post, read top few comments* and now I have a full grasp of the subject. If you bring evidence to clarify, modify or disprove their belief. You're the idiot not them. I get it, it's really easy to become an "expert" when you can Google something real quick and regurgitate some half ass attempt to summarize. But it takes some level of understanding to think critically on a subject. 
I stick around for those monthly gold nuggets. Plus like I said, crypto is as much a social movement as it is technological. I like to see what people think and feel. I have learned to keep my own opinions and insights off of Reddit. Mostly. We think in the box here at Reddit. Until someone spells it out in an epic long post. Where a child could understand. Citing every source for every piece of information. Because then you did the hard work for them. It could be 100% wrong. But it would take another epic response to disprove said post. And now we have a . If you want an answer on Reddit. Don't post a question. Post the WRONG answer to the question. And put on your thick skin.

 1 in 5 Americans just had their SSN compromised. That's a lot of new SSN's. Or do we wait until a person has money stolen before we act? It would be nearly impossible to reissue ten's of millions of SSN's. Secondly, you dont have to change a SSN if it can't be stolen in the first place.

I was not looking to help with anything. I was looking to have either a conversation or just get one started. You haven't explained anything. You have made statements which are so close minded with no information to back up anything you say. [I see you have no idea what the blockchain is capable of]( I am not interested in explaining the blockchain and it's rudimentary uses. Which I am not sure you could even give me.
As I stated in my post. I was looking for those more informed to have a candid conversation. You have proven quite the opposite. The blockchain is basically useless in your eyes from what you have stated. From what I gather, your dealings with the blockchain solely revolve around Bitcoin.

My frustration with Coinbase is on a completely different playing field. Coinbase is a legitimate company. I do think they need to work on their backend, customer service and just service in general. If they want to be the PayPal of crypto. They cannot keep going down during the falls and climbs.
Not even in the same realm of argument as Genesis. Genius argument is if it's a scam. I say absolutely. They will not be around mining for any lifetime other than their bottom line. Edit: just to add to this. The vast majority making money here. Because you CAN make money. Is those with high affiliate numbers. The transparent ones will even admit their real income is from affiliate links. By FAR. [I can make it look really pretty. But I am still called the same thing.](
Coinbase needs to improve upon their business.
