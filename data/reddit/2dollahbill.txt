What do you mean? Doges always give tips to each other!

OK not trying to showoff or anything but our doge was on a NASCAR :)
But come on shibe why can't we just be friends? Why all the hate you know? Dogecoin is such a friendly atmosphere. Take more doge :)
+300 doge
To the moon!(just have fun man)

No no no. I'm not leaving doge, I think its smart to have a little bit on one side and another on the other. :) +100 doge :D

To be honest its not man. I havent spent any money on bitcoin yet($14 from tips which I greatly appreciate) but cryptocurrency is fun. Even if doge coin drops to 0 I wouldnt have lost that much money. With bitcoin there is much more risk which I want to get my foot in

Many tips. 420x540=very money. Much thanks. Wow.

The point of a joke is to laugh and have fun, not have a stick up your ass about a word, in this case "such arrogance"
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:25:08
How would I exactly do this?
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:54:07
You know what you're right man? I'm sorry :(

I have other accounts man. I use this for doge and providing NASCAR updates, however thanks :) I'm not the richest guy in the world (make $500 every 2 weeks) and I feel like I can get my foot in the door a little bit and adventure!
