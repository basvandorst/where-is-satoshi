So is bitcoin dead now?

That'll be because you didn't put your money in a financial institution and collect interest on it over the 45 working years you had till you turned 65.

If it was a joke about the Irish drinking too much, the Anti-Defamation League would chuckle.  If someone made a comment about Asians being good in math, they'd ignore it.  If someone hinted that Louie and Clement were to break ya's legs... they'd shrug it off.
But any slightest hint at a derogatory comment about the Jews, and they light up their bat-signal for all the chosen people to rise up and declare how disgusted they are at the overt antisemitism.
Get over yourselves already.

Then they aren't really about anti-defamation in itself, but anti-defamation against jews.  They should have called themselves the Jew Pride Brigade or something
Fact is, if they only care about their own race/religion, then they are really kind of just racists themselves.

Default the changetip response to be private so we don't have to look at it responding to every comment that submits a changetip

Well, forever is a very long time.  Let's talk about a more reasonable time frame, like the next 100 years.  That is more than enough for a lifetime and into your children's life time.  
The answer to that is yes, they can.  Assuming of course there are no major catastrophe's the destroy our economy and life as we know it, and the asset is still something of value.  Land tends to be a great asset.  There is only a limited amount of it, and always will be till we colonize space, which isn't happening soon as far as anyone knows.  Land next to major centers of civilization (NYC, London, Tokyo) are a pretty safe bet to continue appreciating in value in the coming years.  (Well, maybe not NYC if global warming continues)
It's better said that asset's don't often appreciate in value in double-digit percentage for very long.  And if they do, it's quite probable that there will be an eventual correction to value closer in line to a more reasonable rate of growth and valuation.
People who couldn't figure that last bit out on their own kinda deserve what they got. 
It should also be a warning to people who are buying into bitcoin.  In fact it is pretty funny because I think this post has an implication that millenials should/are looking into bitcoin as a non-financial-institution asset they can hold.  Having a very significant portion of your funds in bitcoin is a HORRIBLE idea.  Much much much worse in terms of risk than buying into a stock market index.

I cringed.  I cringed hard.

Jews and finance.  This is not at all surprising.
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:09:01
It's history.  Deal with it.  Jews were strongly instrumental in the development of the financial industry because they were able to charge interest when Catholics and Muslims wouldn't.  
So fuck off.
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:06:32
Fuck off, this is just history.  Look up the history of Jews and usary in the middle ages.  
Jews gotta jew what a jew gotta jew.

The same could be said about any criminal who might have a large stash of wealth somewhere.  "Oh you committed a bank heist? And the money wasn't recovered?  Come over here bitch."

So I get 2^256 = 1.15792E+77 different combinations.  So if 1 trillion computers were operating at 1 trillion combinations per second for the entire age of our universe of 13 billion years, it would take  141,220,887,041,569,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 universes with similar 1 trillion computers operating at 1 trillion operations a second for thirteen billion years each till they ever reached the halfway point.  Or 141 decillion in arabic short notation.
