You need a stable currency for it to be viable for most businesses. Most businesses run on low margins. So if that margin is obliterated 2 out of 10 days due to fluctuating currency then you go out of business. Yes, if it goes up then they make more. But when it drops like it did yesterday you now have something that you have to hold on to in order to make any profit thereby destroying its liquidity. And making it hard to use unless you have other liquid assets.

Ill agree with you. Everyone keeps going crazy over people who accept bitcoin but a large percentage of people are holding it only in hopes that they can sell high and make money. When enough people do that then it doesnt really serve its purpose as a currency and it doesnt have any tangible backing like a stock. This guy is a perfect example of people buying in the hopes of making money.

If you are holding it then it is not working as a currency. It is working as a stock. Which is OK for something like Dollars or Euros because enough is in circulation elsewhere. But when a large percentage of people are holding it as stock and not using its purchasing power it leads to bubbles.

Except for its not secure and its not a commodity. Gold and silver had some sort of tangibility to them and also stability. A bitcoins only value is our agreed upon value for it. So when people hold it, it loses value because it has less use. The only reason it got so big is because people created a bubble.
