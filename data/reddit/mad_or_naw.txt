so what are people going to do when bitcoin skyrockets and rich folks who have been investing in stocks or what have you going to do? this little escapade is going to make people broke and there has to be a new currency besides bitcoin that can be evenly allocated and THEN the startup can happen. we make new currencies every day. yall holding on to bitcoin is as bad as them holding on to the dollar. don't just throw it in and it's dog eat dog.... we're humans. not dogs. make a new currency and quit holding it so close to your heart. you can't leave out 99% of the population.

If i knew more into the jargon I'd tell you, but you are going to have to define terms and display your proposition. I haven't an idea of a ledger public.

everyone. i got like 50 downvotes hahaha. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 10:17:33
you are a crazy motherfucker. this is more than likely not the first wave. i think there will be at least 3 more down to nearly 100. i'd sell of some profit. maybe come back in a little below 250 but that's crazy too.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:01:45
what a crazy fucking asshole. i like it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:59:49

I HOPE ALL YOU FUCKERS REALIZE THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY IS NOT GOOD. IMAGINE A POLICE STATE THAT WIPES YOUR WALLET JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO WHAT THEY SAY.

you can't wipe out someone's hard cash, but you can dismantle anything on the internet.

Buying now is the craziest thing ever. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:30:38
blah blah blah
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:40:57
I mean I don't think it will ever go over $10k. You know how many people would have to get behind that? Even if, I don't think it will happen for like 20 years and by then you'd have to be even crazier to buy. It's really just a big bubble. Look how many people sell once it reaches it's all time high. I've seen so many penny stocks do what bitcoin is doing and they always drop and flatline eventually. It's way to volatile for any sane person to even consider buying. I remember buying once when it was like 600 dollars and I sold for about 900 when it was rising pretty rapidly, and then it went to like 1,200. sure i kicked myself a little but then I saw how much it dropped. It went back down to $200. I should have bought there, but I had my predisposition that it wasn't going to climb. 2 years later and it's doing the exact same thing as before, but more people know about it now so that's why it hit 3k. But just watch it drop down to $1000. I will laugh.

how does it keep going up?
