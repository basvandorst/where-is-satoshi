You have been indoctrinated by public education my friend. They managed to contribute to society despite those social programs, not because of them. It's like the old argument that NASA took us to the moon when private enterprise would have taken us there much faster and cheaper if it had been allowed. We would probably be taking commercial rides to mars by now. Education is no different.

Why can't we all get along and settle on a combination of Second Layer Lightning Network and slowly increasing blocks? You know, what Bitcoin Core is proposing...
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:21:57
The rabbit hole goes way deeper than you think. Glad to have sown the seed in you. Now it's up to you if you want to stay with the program and gratuate to become another mediocre slave or want to be really free. My graphic  is simplified, sure, if you want details, you can start by reading F. Hayek's Road to Serfdom, the book on which the graphic is based.

The alleged attack wasn't as grandiose as portrayed in the media in the first place. A miner would have to lose a lot of money initially and potentially damage their source of long term income in exchange for some hypothetical shorts. Miners would probably just report the bug and keep their machines humming and making money for the long term. It's what I would have done.
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:23:13
Yeah! Fuck'em! They only create state dependent sheep and zombies like yourself, so deeply enslaved by the system they can't even see their own chains. What are you even doing in a Bitcoin forum? Bitcoin is about freedom, liberty, not statism

The problem is most newspapers are owned by special interests, either governments or private tycoons. They can't possibly survive on their own and do quality investigative work by just running ads so they have to sell their souls. This is why we have an epidemic of Fake News going on all over the place. If newspapers could become profitable again, like back when they sold real paper, maybe a little truth could come out of them.

I made the graphic precisely because I don't have time to explain the Road to Serfdom to every snowflake out there I encounter in social media. I know it's simplified, I was hoping for smart comments here to make it better.

That's not how LN works. Your money is not trapped when you connect to an unknown node. That's exactly the idea, that you can connect to nodes without trusting them or even knowing who they are.

I tried to summarize and update an entire book "The Road to Serfdom" in a single page so that short attention span millennials would get it. It's unlikely I'll compete with the majority of loser academic professors out there spreading statism all over. But, every now and then I manage to red pill a few souls from the Matrix so it's worth it to sow seeds of liberty. I appeal to your curiosity and ask you to investigate because I don't really have time to explain everything.

My intent is not to attack you, you remind me of myself circa 2011. I had the same reaction back then to Bitcoin, dismissing it as worthless and foolishly believing it would never reach dollar parity... haha. I'm a also a developer and work in the IT industry. Then in 2013 I saw in amazement it wasn't dead yet as I expected and dug deeper, not only into the tech but also its politics.  I started running a Bitcoin node over Tor (and also a Lightning Network node more recently) on a $200 laptop and I realized that this thing was anti-fragile, if I can do that with so little resources, anyone can, it's not going away. I also realized its monetary uses are only a small part of it, it is really about a Revolution in Trust, something that never existed on the internet and that will change the future.

It's obvious you don't know much about Lightning Network, it's origins and history. Don't worry, the good news is you don't have to. Your employer will give you some satoshis at the end of the month and they will deal with the channels. Just like you are oblivious your internet routing is done on many layers you don't really have to know how money works to use it.

Of course, they are just trying to cover the sun with a finger. The real solution to Bitcoin scaling is a combination of Lightning Network + moderately bigger blocks, just what Bitcoin Core has on their roadmap

You can but you won't. What have you done to promote BTC and LN?
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:43:49
Bitcoin is anti-fragile. It doesn't matter what governments do, it will grow stronger the more they attack it. 
What most people don't know is that there were many centralized attempts at creating digital currencies before Bitcoin, they were all crushed by government intervention. 
However, Bitcoin is decentralized, they can't control it. The more they squeeze it in a jurisdiction, the more it grows in others and the stronger it becomes. 
Eventually governments will try to co-opt it, make it theirs and push the little guys away. They will fail at this too in the long run but it's coming. 
Once ETFs are approved, this is what will happen. The big guys will control huge strategic reserves and the peasants will be paid with satoshis on Lightning Network wallets owned by their employers and for which they won't hold the keys. Mark my words

@_date: 2018-08-29 22:23:44
The book is great! I agree with Ammous in most things, however I think you should read other books, such as Ben Graham's The Intelligent Investor. Bitcoin is not 100% guaranteed to become the harder money, just like Myspace was not guaranteed to be dominant in Social Media. An index tracking the top coins by market cap is the best way to go. Bitcoin is the most likely to succeed right now but it's not set in stone.

Why are you still relying on your parents? Get your own money and invest that in an index holding the millionth of supply of the top coins by market cap (get the crypto millionaire app to track it). Don't invest money you need to live, only money you can spare. Live frugally, don't buy crap that depreciates. In a few years you'll be able to retire while your parents are still working

However, I have also read Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor, Margin of Safety by  Seth A.

Only holding Bitcoin is arrogant and arrogance is harshly penalized in investing.

The only way Segwit can be saved is if miners get a piece of the pie from Lightning settlements. They don't support it right now because they are being sidelined. However if Lightning implements a hardcoded policy of sharing a percentage of fees from its nodes with miners when transactions settle on the main chain they will all switch and this debate will be over. This is so evident I have no idea why they haven’t done it yet…
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:38:49
Maybe it is, I admit, but miners have made a lot of investments on specialized equipment that can only do one thing: mine. Why would they now have to buy nodes and hire people to maintain them? Also, the when LN transactions settle on the main chain they get a very small fee compared to the thousands of potential transactions that can happen on the payment channel, they are being sidelined, no wonder they are boycotting Segwit. FYI, I support Segwit + Lightning, I want it to have a chance

This kind of arrogant talk is what's keeping miners away from Segwit. Miners can just say no, they don't want to change their business to maintaining nodes and BU gives them just that, even with its many flaws and risk of splitting Bitcoin they are siding with it because of this arrogance.
