Both of those articles were written by Forbes "contributors", not Forbes "staff". Forbes is basically a blogging platform now.

I've met quite a few people with that opinion. I haven't met any that have also produced anything of intellectual value. They're people who are consumers, not producers, of intellectual property.

Mike Hearn worked at Google and left to do Bitcoin stuff. He's the guy that created the Lighthouse platform that's been getting so much attention on the front page.

Just like TOR makes it easier for the government to monitor traffic that people don't want them to see.
Sure, you can use Bitcion and TOR anonymously, but if you make one single mistake you're toast. They both provide a false sense of security.

How is Pirateat40's scam similar to GAW? Pirateat40 pulled a textbook Ponzi scheme - he promised ridiculous returns and paid new investors with old investors' money.
While GAW might be a scam, I don't see how it's a Ponzi scheme since Paycoin investors aren't actually being paid. People are just forking over money for nothing in return. It might be outright fraud, but I don't see any indication that it's a Ponzi scheme and I don't see any similarities to Pirateat40's case other than people are being ripped off.

Uh, no. If you truly love Bitcoin you should be skeptical of all companies that are promoting Bitcoin. The nature of Bitcoin (pseudo-anonymous, non-reversible transctions) makes it a ripe target for scammers and fraudsters of all types.
Also, as a journalist, your job isn't to back anything - it's to report on the facts. When you start promoting something, you stop being a journalist.
It's crazy that you  just admitted that your goal is to promote Bitcoin and Bitcoin companies. Maybe you should change the site's name because "Crypto Currency News" implies that there's some journalism going on and not just shilling for Bitcoin and alt-coin companies when you made it clear that there isn't.

This still isn't safe.
DON'T CLICK LINKS IN EMAIL, EVER. DON'T DO IT.
If you get an email from coinbase, open up a new browser and type in coinbase.com with your fingers. Or use a bookmark. But whatever you do, don't click the fucking link. It's internet security 101 and this is how 90% of people "get hacked".

I don't work for Cryptsy, but here's what this looks like from their end:
1. Someone creates an account and deposits 180BTC
2. Some time later, someone logs into this account.
3. Based on their logs, it looks like person 2 might not be the same as person 1. The IP address don't match. The account could have been hacked. Notice from the screenshot that 2FA isn't enabled, which is a stupid risk for someone to take with that many coins.
4. They ask for ID, but the person pushes back. They don't speak good English. They eventually send a copy of some crazy looking ID in a non-Latin alphabet that doesn't match the country that the IP address is from.
OP admitted to using a VPN to access the site so it's totally possible that the IP changed and it doesn't match the country they're in.
This is all very suspicious. For everyone freaking out at Crypsty, if this was your account and OP was a criminal who phished your account credentials, would you want them just handing over the money without checking their ID?
The reason they want so many forms of ID in this case is probably so they have something to hand over to law enforcement if it turns out that OP actually is a scammer.

I don't know about comparing them to Ferrari.
Accel is just one of the most active VC firms that funds many companies. They throw their money at anything, hoping it sticks. Getting funded by Accel isn't like being in an exclusive club, like owning a Ferarri. Anyone with half a brain and a business plan written on a napkin in lipstick could get investment from Accel.

You should re-read the GLD prospectus if that's what you think...
You're not buying physical gold or a share of physical gold. You can't trade your shares of the ETF for physical gold. You are buying interest in a trust that owns gold.
Sorry if that sounds nit-picky, but it's a pretty huge difference.

Because when they see "bitcoin" they think "scams and drugs" and don't want involved. People who haven't heard of bitcoin just assume it's a scam. Someone you don't know posts a message telling you to go to a site, give that site access to your account, and you'll get free money for it? That honestly sounds like a scam to me. It reminds me of those banner ads you used to see saying "you won a free iPod, click here to claim it!" that ended up signing you up for a bunch of subscriptions to shit.

If you think that he was on trial for running a website and was found guilty for crimes committed by its users, you really haven't paid attention to the trial.
He was charged with some very specific crimes. There was overwhelming evidence he committed them himself. The jury only took 3.5 hours to find him guilty.
There is no precedent whatsoever that website operators could be held accountable for their users actions. That wasn't even at stake here.

Economics is more of an art than a science. The track record of economists successfully predicting the effect of economic policies is not good.
For any given economic policy or system, you can find one well-respected economist that agrees and one that doesn't.
Hell, Nobel prizes in economics have been awarded to economists with directly opposing views. In 2013 it was awarded to three people. One of them is considered the father of the "efficient market hypothesis" (Fama) and another is someone who completely dismisses the idea (Shiller). Which one is the correct economist?

It's hilarious that Garza posted on hashtalk a few days ago talking about hiring the new legal team because "the regulatory landscape has changed night and day the last month. "
... but there were no changes in the regulatory landscape. The laws and regulations haven't changed.
It sounds like what did change was the fact that they learned they're being investigated by the SEC.

What's the point? Funding the miners?
I don't really understand the "let's tip each other!" mentality, you're just tossing coins back and forth and paying a fee for the privilege.
