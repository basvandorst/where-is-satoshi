it actually is different.  a Bitcoin ATM charges you a fee like Coinbase charges you a fee and delivers coins to you that you did not previously own.  it is a point of sale device and you are making a purchase, not a withdrawal

what civil rights are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:57:18
oh i misunderstood.  ya, i agree obviously
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:53:46
i agree with you but c'mon man


i am picturing a black and white infomercial scene where someone goes to a counter to pay grabs and bobbles a credit card, drops it, knocks everything off the counter and falls to the ground, then puts up his arms and shakes his head while a voice says "now you don;t have to!"

why the fuck would you tell him how you knew he was full of shit?  in detail?? you instructed him on how to be a better scammer.  next time he won't use pictures from ebay, will spend more time on photoshop and curate some 'credible' reddit accounts.  
you're a fucking idiot

you should add 'an anonymous transaction is a suspicious transaction' to your summary

'le system' is also a pretty general term for the government as a whole so it could be a coincidence.  
also even if it was called something more idiosyncratic like 'the Fedstem' or something and OP casually called it that, it still wouldn't be proof like me saying "can't respond now i'm on the job" wouldn't prove i'm a cop
@_date: 2014-09-06 15:00:25
so millions of botnets were made?  how did they use those to catch him?

can you by chance direct me to the trial transcripts?  i can't find it for the life of me

That is clearly a false statement. However we are influenced greatly from holdovers from medieval times, especially in government

1984 was a vision of the future under fascism and it's a bit outdated.  A Brave New World was a more accurate prediction

I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone rationally calling for a life sentence for any one guilty of non violent crimes

this is besides the point.  anyway, wouldn't this extend to any business dealing in any form of commerce that wants to use Bitcoin and not just finance companies?
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:36:37
Yes but yoy could imagine an ATM that accepts cash would jot havr that problem. besides reversibility there are anti-money laundering regulations that require IDs as part of the on boarding.

bitcoin is interesting as a technology.  the price is irrelevant and will be extremely volatile for a long time
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:19:22
there is a pretty significant amount of risk involved for small gains.  this risk is in access to your funds and unpredictable market movements among other things

the largest subset of transactions on silk road were orders for small amounts of marijuana.  thus you have casual users who no longer have to deal with criminals (circularly, because marijuana is illegal) and eliminating the risk of violence or up-selling with harder drugs for these individuals.  like it or not, this was the most common use case for Silk Road.
in general transactions were in smaller amounts, likely because of a combination of the orders being from casual users and fear of detection or steeper penalties for possession of larger amounts.  for casual users, again we have a reduced risk of violence.  
there is no evidence that the silk road increased real world drug dealing and that statement would frankly be nearly impossible to prove.  likewise the statement that silk road reduced violence *as a whole*, however it's safe to say that the silk road reduced the *risk* of violence for casual users.

Is it? If it's the only known way to achieve it, even in theory, then at the moment it's both necessary and sufficient. There is no way for a centralized system to be censorship resistant, therefore since you can achieve censorship resistance via decentralization, it is both necessary and sufficient. 
The only way it wouldn't be sufficient is if you could achieve censorship resistance outside of the centralized/decentralized paradigm, which does not exist 
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:11:35
i guess so
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:11:06
i have no idea what the fuck you are talking about
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:28:45
it's been done before, [most famously in the 90's with fingerprint and dna evidence]( (sorry that's so long, there are shorter sources of info like wikipedia, tl;dr FBI backed up police testimony with forensic evidence without actually doing the lab work).  
you have to admit that it's a possibility and the evidence we are talking about is particularly easy to fabricate.  i'm simply claiming it as a possibility and saying that none of us can say for certain on either side.

chat logs are just plain text--they are not delivered with any kind of digital signature to prove their authenticity or accuracy, i.e. they can be tampered with.  in his federal hacking case, Weev claimed the government not only altered chat logs but completely fabricated some.  this doesn't prove Ulbricht is innocent, it just proves that your evidence is not airtight and we will likely never know the truth.  if you say you know the truth for sure, you are wrong
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:47:21
what the fuck is this?  where am i?
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:17:56
i don't understand how you can say that you know for sure.  you have to trust the government that the evidence for murder for hire wasn't faked, and you'd have to believe that the government faked them to say he's didn't do it.  either way you are making a judgement based on the limited evidence
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:17:48
i did bother to review it actually, if i remember correctly they just demonstrated that the files came from his computer (or his TorChat keys), which the government had full access to.  it did not convince me that the logs were indisputably his or that they weren't tampered with.  please correct me if i am wrong
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:21:02
sure, i agree with that
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:04:02
we know for certain there was a transaction from Ulbricht's wallet to some bitcoin address.  if the logs were fabricated then this means they were fabricated cleverly to have this correlation.  it doesn't prove the integrity of the logs
