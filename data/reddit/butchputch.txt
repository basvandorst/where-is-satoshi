Fuck!!! I wanted to use futures on BTC but BitMex fees are too high, so I decided to use OKex. I still haven't closed the position, but you make me worry.
Is this standard procedure for withdrawals?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:50:04
Well, Bitmex does that but he is clearly not looking for it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:33:45
I don't get what you are asking for if it's not Bitmex or OKex
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:24:49
The have very high volumes from what I see on CMC, so it should be pretty trusted. Still, I hate haveing to wait for whitdrawal!
Let me know if you manage to solve this.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:42:31
I'd say it's OneCoin

I am sorry to bother you but have no alternatives. I've been trying to understand why the increase in block size means centralization. I am not a BHC supporter, it's a legit question and I have still not found any real answer. Would you care to make me understand please?

Thank you very much for the response. I can't grasp a couple of points since I have never put real effort into understanding technical aspects of crypto, but I get the ceoncept you are expressing.
Nonethless, blockchain size doesn't really seem to be a big obstacle. I take your word when you say that I wouldn't be able to run a full node, I am not saying I don't trust you.
But, according to my calculations, in the next 5 years BCH blockchain size will be about 2.3TB. I mean, a 4TB disk right now is about 80$, I guess in 5 years it will be in the 20-30$ range. It isn't such a big expense...
Not arguing about points 3 and 4 since I don't understand them, so I'll take your word :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:29:20
Well, you are missing opportunities, but not really losing any money.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:15:11
Thank you very much! For deposit I did the conversion to BCH and then back to BTC and was fast. I intended to do it for withdrawal, but I will stick to ETH like you, just in case.
Thank you very much, you saved me some stress!
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:50:28
0.0001 I suppose.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:03:04
Well, USD will probably be worth 20% less (based on inflation of 18.2% over last 10 years).
Bitcoin MIGHT be worth more, less or zero.
So yeah, with USD you have a guaranteed loss, but you can make an estimate about it.
With BTC you really are gambling.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:15:08
I think he does. Do you?
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:42:00
Yeah man great analysis! But I am even more bullish than that:
There are 1300000 stars in the universe and we have approximately 30.000 bacteria in our mouth. If you multiply 1300000 by 30.000 and then by the number of hair on my ass, it means that 1 BTC will be equal to 6,02x10^23
It'd be cool right?
Edit: Warren Buffet here above me deleted his comment out of embarrassment. He did an excellent estimate of BTC fair value by adding up billionaires market cap today and supposing it will all become in Bitcoin one day. Hence my reply.

Bitconnect returns 01/01/2017 - 30/11/2017
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:58:25
Have you ever heard of bitconnect. Estabilished for 2 long years. You should buy it
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:54:49
Well, my shit is the rares asset then. It's unique and no more will be produced.
There is a finite amount of gold on the earth, so there is no difference with Bitcoin. The rate of extraction of gold does not influence its total supply.
According to your argument, anything with a limited supply is the rarest asset on earth. If we had 21 billions of BTC instead of 21 millions, it would still be therares asset, right?
Same with 21 trillions or 21 googols and so on.
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:15:32
Sure it is, but the chart is referring to the assets, not about the contingencies of specific countries.
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:46:18
Then explain why price stability is bot included in the chart. Bitcoin is not durable since it doesn't assure you it is able to retain an intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:24:23
I am not talking about any specific country. I am saying that a FIAT guaranteed by a stable nation has shown to be reliable, so we can say that FIAT is estabilished.
EUR has 18 years but the conversion from national currencies to EUR when the single countries joined EU has been flawless and currencies conversion to euro has been possible till 2013. So you can consider EUR as estabilished as the currencies of EU states were before the creation of the union.

"More rare than gold"
That's the most stupid thing I have ever heard. How do you decide that?

If the encryption is revealed to be unsafe, there is no network. Do you understand that or not?
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:14:07
You just said that. If the encryption method changes and you, after 20 years, try to open your wallet, you won't be able to!!!
Is it so hard to understand?
Also, any encryption method will be considered safe until it's broken. So I don't see how could you consider it is "simply not the case"
Are you new here or what? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:38:36
If bitcoin is as durable as gold, why isn't it already used worldwide?
Gold is anonymous as much as Bitcoin, there should be no problem in using it instead of gold, right?
Well, first of all no one guarantees that encryption won't be broken in the near future. So, even if a new version is released, there will be a time when BTC is updated and if you left it in your trezor for 30 years, your wallet will probably be lost. Your gold won't.
There are a lot of more reasons, but I'd like to hear your opinion on this one first. Still A+?
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:55:29
"You need a single machine to continue mining put of the whole world"
Yeah, sure. How didn't I think about that! Hey, let's just stop mining then, so we can save on electricity and have a single machine mining. What are you saying? Oh, sure, this machine could arbitrarily reverse transactions and empty my wallet but, you know, who cares.
Bitcoin is a network and Metcalfe's law is valid for bitcoin too.
"Gold can be destroyed bla bla changings atoms bla bla another element"
Well, seems you are an alchimist. I highly suggest you to change atoms and create gold then.
By the time gold is destroyed by a Supernova I think that earth too will be destroyed, so I don't see a problem there.
Now, is it more likely for bitcoin to fail or our world to be destroyed by a supernova? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:28:46
Figuratively empty your wallet. You will still have your bitcoin, if that's what you are saying, but it will be worthless.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:03:22
If you own bitcoin and XMR, for example, becomes the standard, you lose everything. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:20:25
It'd be ok if D was the lower grade, but i see fiat has a F on censorship... I wonder what would be needed to have a E or F in estabilished history. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:42:30
Still, it would be appreciated in very specific situations. Also, I think people from those countries would be more willing to buy gold rather than crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:58:37
I think I have read a similar comment some months ago. The only difference is that Bitcoin was at 10k.
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:06:40
It makes no sense to use a mean of currencies lifespan, cause we are talking about the potential every currency has. A FIAT guaranteed by a stable state has no reason not to be considered "estabilished". Take EURO or USD, would you consider them not estabilished?
I understand your argument, but I think that since FIAT could refer to any currency, we should consider the one used in the most stable countries. I don't think it would make sense to include Zimbabwean Dollars, for example. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:53:02
How do you synch your wallet if there is no network anymore?
If price plunges to zero it means no one is using it, so no one will mine and validate blocks

What do you think will happen if adoption doesn't come? If another coin becomes the standard and bitcoin loses all its value?
There is no smart or dumb money. In the crypto game it's almost only luck. No one has made serious money trading coins AFAIK, a lots did just by hodling, often because they nearly forgot about their coins.
If you believe in BTC, just buy it. If you don't, don't buy it. Either choice is not smart neither dumb.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:40:39
Are you just trying to argue or just stupid? Gold has been there for hundreds of years, BTC for 10. If you leave it in your trunk for a couple of decades you may find it still there, but with no value. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:55:24
I don't know what do you mean for "stable". If you mean that EUR will very unlikely be affected by hyperinflation, then yes, I think it is stable.

Did you even read my comment? Who guarantees ECDSA to be safe?
An electronic mean of payment can't ever be as durable as a physical one.
PS: never said it is not durable because it has not reached mass adoption. I am just asking why it isn't happening already. There is a lot of knowledge about BTC compared to past years, but still it is pretty rare to hear that anyone with a big capital uses it as a store of value.

@_date: 2018-06-09 18:51:00
First of all, you can't really use the definitions of "durability" for bitcoin.
Second, gold is an element and can't simply disappear.
On the contrary, bitcoin private keys are constantly lost. The amount of lost bitcoins increases over time.
Now, if the system is safe as you are saying, those lost bitcoins don't really exist. They are not recoverable.
Gold can't disappear, bitcoin can. Explain how the second is more durable. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:59:29
1) We don't know what is the biologial limit of human height
2) 384k for 21mln is a marketcap of 8k mld. Not impossible, but also not really realistically expectable
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:53:36
If the problem is that Bitcoin is worth 7k, then let's just split it and use mBTC.
1 mBTC is worth 7$. Woah man, are you saying it's going to 20$??
