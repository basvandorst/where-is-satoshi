Ah yes, the man himself says he's not. What a fair source.

Unless two people are having the literal exact same issue with kraken at the exact same time, [this guy is Ed Krassenstein]( - a convicted fraud, and ponzi runner.
It's actually a miracle Kraken didn't shut the account sooner.

Yes, if you ignore the fact that between those cherrypicked figures the numbers went wildly up and down like a financial rollercoaster from hell, it does look like BTC is on a remarkably convenient upwards curve. 
But in reality, a currency that can go from $2k/ea to $20k/ea to $6.3k/ea all in the space of a year is uselessly unstable.

That's kind of why new currencies are exceedingly rare, and why several attempts before to introduce them have failed. It's not something unique to bitcoin, it's unique to trying to introduce a new currency.

And if you ask economists, they would laugh so hard at the prospect of an "Austrian economic system" that they'd be in danger of injuring themselves. 
Austrian Economics is, to be blunt, a joke.

Who said Keynesian and Austrian were the only systems/theories?
They aren't.

Sorry to barge in, but the idea that Gold's value is primarily supported by its use as an investor's hedge isn't true - the price is often driven because supply of Gold is extremely inflexible while investor demand fluctuates greatly...
But only around 25% of Gold (according to [Statista]( is put into investments - the vast bulk of Gold actually goes to various industries, whose demand is pretty steady. 
Because of the extreme inflexibility of the gold supply, it only takes a small move in demand to cause a great change in price - which is why the small variance in investor use has caused such great changes... using market cap in such inflexible markets is a poor idea for related reasons. The price got so high because supply wasn't able to meet buying demand. If you were to attempt to sell it all out, there wouldn't be nearly enough demand from industry (which is pretty fixed) or new investors (few are willing to catch the falling knife), price would implode... and your market cap would evaporate. 
If you actually want a stable hedge of value, platinum group baskets are far better. Gold is too tainted by speculators operating in fixed markets.
