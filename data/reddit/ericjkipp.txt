@_date: 2018-09-05 13:02:20
I dont need an answer it was rhetorical. 
You can hire my Gma for 50 an hour to wipe your tears and make you some cookies though ����
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:25:04
Ouch were going back down..god I hate being right..
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:31:44
Lol you bought 20k at over 7k BTC youre gonna cry...im waiting for the drop cause im not a moron. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:26:52
Yeah in 2013 no one will see gains that level again. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:41:46
VET isnt a shitcoin youre retarded. And i got in at .0068 lol. BTC going under 4k you heard it here first! ���� 
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:07:27
Do not buy it will go down more. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:24:54
I tried to tell yall...this wasnt organic or real, it was a raping of the short traders. You wanna yell FUD and downvote the shit out of me but I was trying to protect yo money! 
Get the moons out of your eyes and focus on the reality. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:24:37
"Bla bla bla im on the internet so I can claim to be whatever I want to be." You go on with your belief ive seen results from quality TA. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:56:31
Im just telling the truth. Just like if the market was bullish id say it was bullish...im tryna help people preserve their money..thats all. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:07:23
Yes but buying for long term at a far lower price is far better than just buying at ATH or consistent waves down from ATH and holding...target investment is superior. Someone who has been holding BTC when it was in the 5 digits are just letting their money get rekt. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:46:21
Its going lower. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:52:10
Im not broke in the slightest. Youre retarded lol. People with money dont brag about it like you ya mongoloid..I hope you get big gains on your .25 BTC ����Ill be laughing when your money gets chopped in half for being a FOMO moontard incapable of logic and trend reading. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:06:33
Yeah? Maybe 99% of guys..I found two guys that call bottoms on coins within 10 sats, and are accurate majority of the time on the market. TA and fundamentals are how to successfully invest in this market. If you say otherwise its because you listen to fake ass TA guys or just dont know how to do it yourself. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:13:56
So guess whose getting rekt right now? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:00:49
Yes until an October isnt...when ETF isnt approved at the end of September you think the whales are gonna drive up prices when they can use FUD to blast it down and get in a cheap accumulation phase? Lol. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:37:46
Its not predictable...but you can get a good idea of where it might be going. Nobody can get exact numbers but if you get close thats what counts. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:06:54
 I see you in here always talking like you know whats going on. Lol youre giving terrible advice. BTC could potentially go as low as 2.8-3k before a legitimate trend reversal that isnt manipulation..people should be targeting the best buy in point..not continuously buying dips of dips like a dipshit and losing money/purchasing power. You wanna keep feeding your money to the whales go ahead, dont suggest that others follow your nonsense strategy too. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:22:38
When the trend starts changing on my charts ill believe you lol. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:35:33
TA is absolutely not stupid. The only people who say that are people who cant do it or dont understand it. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:05:59
I learned from the best ;) good luck to you sir
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:14:06
We will go lower than that. Id keep your money ready in USD wallet or tether or something. Just be patient. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:07:33
Idk about 2.5k im seeing 2.8k-2.9k as a possibility though..it is more likely possible we see between 3-5k..we are still in a very bearish downtrend for the year. Right now the market is just untradable... I am parked in fiat and tether besides a couple solid coins I bought cheap enough to where Im not worried about market swings. I think people that believe we are going up bullishly right now or very soon are very naive. The volume isnt there, among many other factors. People arent gonna be ready for this downswing when it comes..if we break support at 5800 people are really gonna see the wild west. Weak hands will be shaken before the big boys play their cards. Count on it. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:25:05
Look at the chart..look at it on the year..we are still very bearish...until it gets past the trend line and shows a promising pattern upwards, we can safely assume we are very much able to go lower. I personally dont know if we will get below 5000 but if 5800 support breaks who really knows.. I would just be wary, my opinion. And no this isnt FUD and yes TA is real. Do your own research and be wise with your buy in. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:48:21
Youll all be sorry ��
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:02:40
Were still bearish calm yourself.
