It seems that the market value of Bitcoin is self similar. The green/yellow/red circles are points of significance. The green circles show the relative maximum of each "cycle". The yellow circles show the relative minimum and the red circles show where we are in the current cycle. Since Bitcoin is self similar, we can use the first cycle to predict the second cycle (the one we are in now). Notice the second cycle covers a longer period of time than the first cycle, so we have to use proportions to get a good estimate on time. 
We see that in the first cycle, the red circle is 1/3 of the way between the 1st yellow circle and 2nd green circle. Lets assume that the distance between between the yellow and red circles in the second cycle follows this same proportion. We know that the length of time between the yellow and red circles in the second cycle is 5 months. So we can estimate that in 10 months from now, Bitcoin will reach a new relative maximum, starting the 3rd cycle.

We can roughly categorize knowledge in the following way : The "Known", The "Known-Unknown" and The "Unknown-Unknown". Dark Energy falls under Known-Unknown and it is likely that there is an X "Unknown-Unknown" that could reshape our understandings of Dark Energy. For now, we see a force that is pushing the expansion of the Universe and we don't know what exactly it is, so we call it Dark Energy. I think this labeling is similar to "phlogiston".

I don't think you will see a lot of people spending Bitcoin for purchases until the price booms again. I would love to spend Bitcoin for bills, food etc, but if I can hold out until the price surges again, those Bitcoins become vastly more valuable and I'm more likely to spend then. Its like a chicken or the egg scenario. We need mass adoption for the price to go up, and we need the price to go up for mass adoption. Which comes first?

Or, they will maim Bitcoin causing users to migrate to a stronger, more resilient cryptocurrency. Then, in a weaker state, Bitcoin can achieve consensus more easily and catch back up. The point is that these attacks may hurt Bitcoin in the short run, but they benefit the cryptocurrency community in the long run. Even if they successfully take down Bitcoin - a more resilient, more private currency like Monero could take its place.

China’s market selloff can safely be declared a rout.
Nearly a third of the country’s individual investors—more than 20 million people—fled the plunging stock markets last month. The number of retail investors holding stocks in their accounts slid to 51 million at the end of July from 75 million at the end of June, according to China Securities Depository &amp; Clearing Corp., the government agency that tracks accounts. As they ran, the Shanghai Composite Index suffered its biggest monthly decline in six years, falling 14% to finish 29% below its June 12 peak.
Unlike in the U.S., where institutions dominate stock trading, retail investors are king in China, owning around 80% of listed stocks’ tradable shares, according to investment bank CICC.
Earlier this year ZZ Xu, a Shanghai restaurateur, put money in the stock market rather than in his business, believing he could get a faster return. He got out before the July rout with his finances intact—indeed, with a profit in the millions of dollars—but his faith badly shaken. Mr. Xu recently signed a new lease for a restaurant in Shanghai, and has moved some of the money he held in stocks back into his businesses.
“Now I realize I can lose a lot of money very quickly,” he said, noting that threats to stocks include China’s slowing growth and the eventual end of government rescue efforts.
Those frantic rescue efforts couldn’t keep the share-price plunge in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which began in mid-June, from continuing through most of July. When the month ended, investors in China were sitting on a paper loss since that June 12 peak of 6.8 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion), according to CICC.

Response to Rout Exposes Regulatory Disarray
Wild Swings the Norm in China’s Markets
Wanted in China: A Public Voice for Calm
Though the crash could mean that there are some bargains out there, it is hardly surprising that China’s turbulent stock markets are drawing fewer new entrants. The number of investors opening new accounts in the week ending July 24 was down 20% from the corresponding week in June.
“Families that haven’t invested aren’t jumping in,” said Li Gan of China’s Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, whose recently released China Household Finance Survey covers 28,000 households. “The market lacks new blood.”
Still, some investors do plan a return to stocks.
“Where else can I put my money?” said Helen Lu. “Real estate is so expensive and beyond our reach, and there are no other good investment channels.” Yields on bank savings accounts, still the most popular place for Chinese to put their money, are low. So the Shanghai-based medical executive’s family put most of their 600,000 yuan in savings in China stocks, only to see the value of their portfolio fall by as much as 60%. Having sold on one of the rebounds, they are now looking to invest again through friends who run funds.
The Chinese are big savers, setting aside as much as 50% of their disposable income, according to the World Bank. The government had hoped to channel some of that from banks to the capital markets, but for now that hope looks rather forlorn.

I agree that challenging ones owns convictions provides the necessary counterbalance to refine those views. I will absolutely delve into Anacho-communist writing to get a better understanding of egalitarian theory. 
In terms of wealth distribution being fair or not, I think we need to step outside of our own bias and look at it objectively. Vsauce made a recent video on [Zipf's Law]( Summed up, there is a natural trend across many elements that reflect a substantially uneven distribution. In terms of Bitcoin distribution, I of course am jealous that a single entity holds 7% of all Bitcoins, but the finite-ness of Bitcoin makes it okay. If they spend those Bitcoins, that percentage will go down and the wealth distribute through the economy. If they don't spend those Bitcoins, holding them props the price up by creating an artificially restricted supply.  Bitcoin holders of course do not like to see substantial price drops and loss of purchasing power, but many of us from the Western world have been spoiled with the relative stability of the US Dollar. Many other countries in South America and Africa deal with their purchasing power fluctuating on a daily basis, so I believe fairness in terms of purchasing power is a relative consideration. Furthermore, I believe long term, Bitcoin will succeed so price fluctuations along the way are just the roller coaster we signed up for.

Hmm. This conversation has brought up an interesting question. Why would an AI be motivated to do anything given its apparent immortality? But would AI really be immortal? They may seem immortal from a human perspective of time, but not so much on a cosmic perspective of time. In X Billion years, our Sun will expand and consume the earth. This threat to an AI's existence would give it urgency to develop technology that would allow it to survive through such events. Also, given our relatively recent discoveries of cosmic threats, it is likely there are other existential threats that we are not yet even aware of. A rapidly learning AI would eventually discover and seek to solve those problems. Its not the questions we know to ask but can't answer, but the questions we don't even know to ask that pose the greatest challenge.

It seems we are entering the perilous void of Nihilism with an interesting twist. Assuming the capacity for AI immortality exists, why pursue said immortality? Even accounting for the possibility that the AI can experience the Universe in the same (or more advanced) ways humans do, is there a point in time billions of years into the future where this becomes lackluster? It seems intuitive to dismiss the assumption that an infinite Universe will become boring and repetitive after a near infinite duration of time. The AI would seek to explore the corners of the Universe and discover unimaginable wonders. But again, for what purpose? Without the pressing imminence of non-existence, what is the motivation to pursue any objective? If an AI could live on forever, would it eventually consider suicide? Or, like irrational numbers and fractal geometry, it simply goes on forever. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 05:13:53
That's a good point. You're right, in a "fair" world, we wouldn't have to worry about a central authority devaluing the IOU notes that are backed by a tangible thing. I was considering a fair world to be one inhabited entirely by AI without humans. In that environment, the AI would still need some form of currency, but in that setting a simple ledger would suffice. Maybe not exactly like Bitcoin, but similar.

Copy the address from your mymonero.com wallet and paste it in the address field on Poloniex. Enter the xmr amount and "Withdraw XMR". 
10-30 min later your balance on mymonero.com will reflect the xmr transaction was successful. 
Go back to Armory and "Receive Bitcoins". Select Clean Wallet. Copy this btc address. 
Go to xmr.to and paste the Clean Wallet address. Enter in the btc amount and click create. Once you click create, xmr.to will generate a temporary transaction that will self destruct in 5 minutes. Keep reading before you click create so you understand what you will need to do within that timeframe. 
Open your mymonero wallet and click send. Once you click create on xmr.to you will need to copy and paste two fields - address to send xmr to AND the payment ID. Copy from xmr.to and paste into mymonero.com send transaction. Enter the appropriate xmr amount xmr.to instructs you to send.
Send the xmr from mymonero.com and wait for xmr.to to update.
If done correctly, your Clean Wallet will receive btc that are not connected to you or your credit card. 
Word of wisdom : Run through the xmr.to process with a very small amount of btc FIRST to get a feel for how it works, then go ahead and use it for larger amounts. 
Best of luck. Be safe. erowid.org is your friend.

I wasn't aware of the 0 mixin. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Still, the xmr.to transaction is only valid for 5 minutes and runs as JavaScript; there is a level of trust that no record is kept for the xmr -&gt; btc transaction. Because the monetary value is jumping from one blockchain (xmr) to another (bitcoin) I think it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to follow those funds.
