Anyone that know the inside working of Gox can "steal" these bitcoins. I really suspect Mark K himself did it.

Its a gag because he got all the gox coins and retiring in an island somewhere. If you look at the video, he does not look slightly apologetic. Almost look like he want to hide a grin the whole time.

I suspect Mark or Gox employees stole the coins. With $350 millions on the line and no way of tracing the wallet the coins were transfer to - it is worth all the legal trouble.

Greed in term of Gox users: If you held coins at Gox, could you not withdrawal the coin elsewhere to exchange it into fiat? Why kept coins at an exchange with withdrawal problems with other coin-fiat service did not? That's the whole point of bitcoin isn't it? It's ease of use and transferability. So anyone could've transfer the coins out of Gox and get fiat elsewhere (Coinbase) or offline wallet until a ATM is setup in your city.
Greed in term of Mark K the CEO: Not saying he stole the Bitcoins at Gox but he or any of his employees knowing the exploits of their own system, can backdoor into the exchange and transfer those coins out into a personal wallet. Declare bankruptcy and play the victim. No? I mean with $350 millions on the line, you have to think it must worth the legal trouble.

I bet its an inside job. This whole thing smelled fishy.
