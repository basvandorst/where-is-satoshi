What are good exchanges that don't screw their customers? You also get upvotes on your previous posts... though I would like a serious answer about the 1099K question I asked initially.

They suck...called, email, tweeted... but they just hang up, ignore and laugh :( but I get you was hoping someone might know something simple as this... can't friggin find it anywhere. My thinking was I'm not the only one going through this and was hoping to tap into the wisdom of the crowd

The API also appears to be unreliable. I created a few functions and it returns error a lot. I'm not sure if it ever goes through but sometimes I see my balances change and that's when I know my order went through. Very scary system to use.

Nice and thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:38:41
Good for you. I think I've decided to just bite the bullet and stop stressing over it.

I traded in and out of fiat. That is a taxable event.

What bitcoin friendly regions are out there that you've learned about?
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:29:30

What is this and how can I follow a long?

Backwards 3 years? I don't think that applies to individuals. I know thats true for corporations.
EDIT: I don't understand why would stating a fact be down voted.

I'm not so sure I'm asking if I should lie. Much of what i have been reading in r/Cryptocurrency has been telling me that IRS don't have the accounting practices to deal with cryptocurrency, that generally from those that have been audited were so because they were honest (which is really backwards), that likely scenario is that IRS rules on cryptocurrency will change x number of times before they get it right, that morality and taxes are two different things from both sides including uncle sam and john doe and I don't want to be the stuckee (referencing that most tax accountants jobs are to find ways to pay the least tax which is all malleable because burden of proof is on the tax payer and everything is case by case). Another interesting post was in r/tax where someone said they are getting a huge lump sum check from the IRS because whatever gains he reported were overlooked because the IRS only cared about what he withdrew and deposited in his bank accounts. So no I don't think I am asking if I should lie. I'm asking what i should do without being bombarded with an insane hassle for something the IRS is way in over their head about.

I know. He was asking about realizing gains which I think I answered his question. I didn't trade via non usd pairs.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:16:58
So I have accounted for all my trades. My only issue is if I made a mistake somewhere like if a buy in x exchange and sell in y exchange or if I did a margin trade which would look strange. Other than this I'm confident in my accounting.

Yea it wasn't something I was aware it required so much responsibility. Honestly does it make sense? I mean if I buy wholesale and sell at a higher price, how is that different from buying and selling coins? Seems like I should just be paying my income tax bracket and be done with it...not all this long term short term BS...
@_date: 2019-04-14 17:39:54
1000 gain or 1000 tax liability?

How is bitcoin/cryptos treated there by the authorities? Is there a "look the other way" mentality among LEO/regulators and the local population (i.e., akin to somewhat of a double standard) or is the government vigilant and actively regulating the space (i.e., punishing/fining offenders)?
And how are these random Chinese people getting their bitcoin?
