I wish you guys luck on trying to get the crypto prediction markets train rolling! I just hope you realize you are hardly the first to try this. BetsofBitcoin, BitBet, Predictious, Fairlay, and many others have come before you and failed - and it wasn't because of the tech. I hope you can learn from them and make the changes necessary to succeed!

Yeah, the part where ~850,000 BTC went.

This would be great for all the migrant workers there *IF* the people back home could spend the bitcoins or transfer the value to fiat at a convenient and competitive rate. Current ATM rates can exceed even Western Union's exorbitant fees.  
Even if the fees were low, how are the Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, or Filipino families going to change btc into stuff they want to buy? 
This is a step forward for getting btc remittances going in Dubai but there needs to be infrastructure on the southeast Asian end of this remittance axis before the action gets started. 
At the moment, I think this is only going to make bitcoin speculation very convenient for Dubai's elite. There are worse things I suppose.

-Khailee Ng from 500 Durians told he liked the idea, but that his pitch “sucked.”

It'll be great to see this again in r/bitcoin a few years from now.

I like this feature a lot, at the moment I use exchanges other than coinbase, but this unique feature would make me want to switch.

-It is so easy now to exchange bitcoin for usd at time of a sale that merchants who don't exchange are doing so voluntarily. 
-In this way, bitcoin is a very stable currency and it's price volatility doesn't effect it's economy negatively.
