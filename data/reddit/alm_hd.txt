Like Bitcoin is the solution to every problem... Since January bitcoin dropped more than the lira.

Does it mean Binance is robbing you more than your traditional bank?
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:46:04
Good point. Made me laugh. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:08:15
This is the mindset here! Use the search bar and search for bank, you will see related posts.

Now Bitcoiners want all currencies to crash. Like, you think Bitcoin is not safe? Look what happened to Venezuelan bolivar or Turkish Lira!
Are you thinking of people living in these countries? Sad. Kinda irresponsible. We all know that the US is behind these crashes. 
Should Iran abandon its currency for Bitcoin?

So are most posts in this sub...
Claiming banks take too much money from people. But the same people pay more fees to use cryptos, in an effort to leave the banking system. huh

I don't know why people would hold cash. Cash is not safe. You can lose it to robbery, it can burn.

Nothing will change African economy. Unless Africans get a serious work ethic.

Paying fees to Banks is considered a robbery.
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:16:25
Now people see the B everywhere.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:24:58
I mean all fees related to bank transactions are considered as robbery. But it is ok to pay for crypto-related fees lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:03:41
You can also keep your ball and lose it to robbery or it can burn.

I am also banned on r/bitcoin because I post truths like this  [imgur](	
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:14:48
Reddit doesn't accept Forex/Stocks related ads too. This seems logical.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:07:57
FUD is different from hacks or ban. BTC is now falling because of lack of interest.

We save what we love ;)

Just a saying. It is not a portfolio itself but can be in your portfolio.

Seen this for Binary options. No regulations no money back. It's gone.
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:47:04
So far.

He'd just won at game banks played. Banks get people broke and this is not a problem.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:58:57
But the US is involved with their sanctions. And when they embargo, they want all the West to do as such.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:30:01
Bitcoin is not money. This is an asset.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:18:56
"Iran is next." "Syria is next". Hum so countries that don't sck the US ass end up like this. I've found the pattern.
