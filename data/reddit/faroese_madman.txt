What do the various pieces of information represent? Ie.:

Freakin' sweet :)
Am I on the right path here you think?  -- I should probably turn it into a StackOverflow question as well.

That is one gorgeous piece of JS, thank you! :) I'm not able to tell exactly what it does (monitize?), so pardon my ignorance but basically it reduces the number of data points by rearranging them into fewer, cleaner time intervals?
I notice Coin Dance's data ( is a lot simpler than BitcoinCharts' CSV - did they clean it up similarly to your script?
As you probably I noticed in my fiddle I'm using Chart.js's Time Scale ( which should by default automatically clean up an overcrowded X axis, but maybe I misunderstood.

One last question if you don't mind:
I'm trying to make a chart that shows the trade volumes for the CAD and DKK:
Using data from these files:
- 
- 
But, how do I deal with the fact that these datasets have different dates/UNIX timestamps? My chart above has DKK's data "forced into" CAD's timestamps -- but this can't be right can it? What should I do?

This is awesome thanks! Is this where Coin Dance gets their data from too?

Hey man, i think we finally made it!! Whaddya think?  -- I'm just starting to realize now how brilliant your code is. If you can write cool stuff like this on a whim, I wonder what other crazy stuff you got.
P.S. Any chance you'd be willing to review my bitcoin startup business plan in exchange for say graphic design/branding/CSS services? Do you have a project that could use a makeover?

For what it's worth here's where I'm at currently: 
I also mailed BitcoinCharts asking them why this data has to be so complex and irregular in the first place.
Cheers!
