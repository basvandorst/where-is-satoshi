Never trust anything that hosts itself on .info
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:46:46
I would love to have some space for a little website. Even shared hosting account.
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:56:48
Thats the source you found with your precious search engine? How much do we have to pay to read the article on this shit website?
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:06:03
I am. Keep me posted. Also that sucks......
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:25:42
Its bitcoin! $10k level should not apply to that.
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:35:46
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:00:48
I don't see there
@_date: 2014-09-08 08:45:30
People have weird bots that lose them money.
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:07:01
You were spot on! Oh wait.....
@_date: 2014-07-17 09:10:46
just stop
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:38:39
Lot of dead links on there
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:32:49
Very shady way of doing bussiness. You can deposit instant but cannot withdraw for any reason be coins or fiat. I tried to withdraw fiat via perfectmoney and after 2 days the request was cancelled with reason: invalid payment details. I really wanted for this exchange to be real.

Can you sell bitcoins on Circle to VISA card? Anyone tried that?
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:29:10
Possibly?! No, no it definately a scam! Stay away!
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:33:47
But.... You are still anonymous
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:23:31
I am sick of these scam exchanges. They saw that the fucking mt.gox got away with it and now everybody is doing it.
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:30:56
did you... did you just describe bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:48:36
Yes it was also fast. Don't know why they removed that option.
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:36:07
Why wouldn't it?
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:55:48
You sure would not trigger some red flags in that bank. Two dudes swapping phones like idiots for 10 minutes
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:01:53
What about their shipping costs. Do they even ship to all european countries?
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:35:24
Namecheap has a little program that can change your A IP, when it changes.

Have you ever heard of utorrent 2.2?
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:37:16
You pay more
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:32:04
He will be here soon. Telling us how bitstamp closed his account for suspicious activity or something like that.

@_date: 2014-05-14 20:10:10
Bitcoin got on ebay/paypal radar. So that is great
@_date: 2014-07-17 09:56:02
DO NOT SCAN ANYTHING. You DON'T have to prove anything!
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:11:22
I see it requires an ass swab.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:54:23
Well it could be 60 dollar wallet. Do not understand why you rule that out as a possibility.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:35:30
You can't get verified for shit on there. "We cannot accept this, we cannot accept that" well fuck you and close my account.
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:20:08
Fuck that. It's still 25GB of garbage on your drive. That is not ok!
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:13:13
That sounds awful. I got nervous after 4 hour wait for payeer to btc-e transfer.
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:36:39
And why is that "our" goal?
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:01:44
Its a hassle. Hard to get bitcoins and harder it is to cash them out.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:35:34
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:23:06
Stop feeding these assholes.
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:15:03
That's nice. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:24:27
It's not rolled out globally so... nothing
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:06:39
Hkcex with new name? No, thanks!!!
@_date: 2014-09-13 09:05:06
What is BTTCOTN?
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:10:55
You mind me asking what are the benefits of storing your money in stocks and gold?
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:37:51
What about the second withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:50:45
Can I deposit via credit/debit card and then get bitcoin with it?
Edit: I can't
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:50:43
How can I get/preorder one of those?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:50:22
Coindesk was the ones that said hey guys use hkcex they are legit bla bla bla
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:31:12
Its understandable. Adblock on Chrome is shit!
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:01:37
so what?
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:16:08
No. It's a house for your face...
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:30:37
I dont get one thing. Will it be decentralised?
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:52:10
Clean your tabs man...
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:57:04
For a second there I tough I was on @_date: 2015-05-31 12:22:17
So why aren't we seeing mass 0/1 confirmation adoption from exchanges and websites?
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:21:06
Reddit's font messed it up good.  thanks for the tip

There is also one entire episode of The Good Wife based around bitcoin and the guy who invented it. It will blow you mind.
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:22:41
Like he is gonna keep them for 100s of years...
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:57:19
This reads like a nigerian prince from india
@_date: 2015-01-23 11:49:33
That was slow.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:29:11
Must be Godaddy
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:54:51
How is 20MB blocksize going to help for faster confirmation times? Sometimes 1 confirmation takes awful amount of time, even with generous fee. What about sites that require 6? I think this will be the next problem for bitcoin in the future. Correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:08:00
Great at adding garbage, but custom fees - no thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:48:14
That's actually pretty good. Good for them!
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:30:59
was this chart ever relevant?
@_date: 2016-12-29 11:31:27
Change that fucking profile picture already.
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:20:14
and be proud of it on top of that...
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:08:07


that's how they get you
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:20:48
Wonder how much they paid for that...
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:27:42
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:16:25
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:59:26
enjoy 1 satoshis @_date: 2017-10-20 16:43:57
But we have bitcoin splitting press...
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:05:19
That bitcoin logo inconsistency is killing me.
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:45:41
What are those? Do you have more photos? I would like to see them.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:33:58
Looks like he invested at the top...
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:42:59
But... But I am a whore...
@_date: 2015-11-22 07:40:49
How familiar are you with the stone age?
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:20:12
And less links to twitter posts.
@_date: 2016-05-21 11:59:21
One day the fucking fee will be 100usd. What will be your tone of voice then?
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:54:47
Actually he might be the creator of Bitocin, but not bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:48:03
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:46:08
Tell that to Mycelium.
@_date: 2015-10-07 09:39:32
Livestock trading it is!
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:47:54
Slap .com on that and you got something.
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:39:56
They got out of reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:08:08


Don't use bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:41:51
Thanks for the click bait. I want mine back plus the ad revenues you got from it.
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:59:46
I am so glad they did not accept my utility bill 1 year ago.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:38:59
What Silicon Valley bitcoin start-ups?
@_date: 2016-05-18 05:19:09
You sold the wrong thing. Your wife would be my first choice. ��
@_date: 2016-05-24 06:47:55
What the fuck is gdax? I've seen that before with coinbase...
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:58:50
I really woldn't want something related to bitcoin to have even false positives!
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:21:59
In my shithole of a country they want to limit cash payments to the  equivalent of 500 euro by 2019.
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:33:21
no. yes.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:01:48
You just reused a joke that was directed at you.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:15:33
Aquire changetip, then accept it.
@_date: 2016-05-21 06:41:11
I don't think so. I meant that they wanted to expand beyond reddit, and thats what killed them.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:42:20


On August 1st this will change to 42 mil.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:44:41
Do it again and you will lose 600€.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:20:47
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:09:08
Double the fees. Yes feed those motherfucjera.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:16:36
Fucking Mycelium is making me pay 220 sat/byte for a low prio transactions. I cannot set it myself. Where do they get these numbers from? Priority transaction is at 500 sat.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:30:56
Store your bitcoins on exchange first chance you get.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:55:02
You win!
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:12:13
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:26:50
Soon they will split the bitcoin, so to have 2 times more in circulation. Which is good for bitcoin.
