Actually its only the newbies who horde old hardware at home from my experience.
Pros dont want old headaches. They want to get rid of them ASAP to make room on the bench for the latest and greatest.

You're completely wrong. Bitcoin back in the day felt worthless even if you had 30000. You could buy a pizza with change (if you could find a vendor who takes bitcoin in exchange for pizza by the time you starve) for your 30k

I think secretly he did. It was his happy little secret.

I think communism works in a bubble.
Once you start introducing capitalism to any degree, the whole system falls apart.

Probably had a lot invested into Cryptsy.

Darn eh.
To bad there were so many other safe options for converting crypto's to BTC/USD.

Things like this are why me, my friends, and my family are going to stay away from the Crypto "Wild West" for a long long time.
It seemed like a decent adventure until Mt Gox closed losing us 1 BTC
Then Dogecoin came along and I got in early. I mined 2 Million Dogecoins and placed 1 Million in Cold Storage.
Then I learned how to "Day Trade" across the Alt Currencies and turned my 1 Million into 1.5 Million...
Then Cryptsy closed and I lost it 1.5 Million Dogecoin.
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice.... well you aren't going to fool me three times.

I'm leery about investing into Cryptocurrency... I feel like all the US Govt would need to do to kill Crypto is focus their efforts in producing a system capable of hijacking the block chain.
I believe the only reason they aren't doing it already is because they want to see others attempt (and fail) so they can gauge what kind of performance other nations can produce in their attempts.
I can't remember when exactly it happened, but a HUGE amount of processing power was added all at once to the bitcoin block chain and then just as suddenly as it showed up... it was gone. Nobody ever solved that one to my knowledge...
