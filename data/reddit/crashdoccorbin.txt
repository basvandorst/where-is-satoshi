I’d love to know the details on how you did this. Even just access to the code and a list of parts.

The “generating the key” reason for getting a trezor/ledger is interesting and something I didn’t realise / hadn’t really thought about. 
I like the idea of punching a steel sheet. If my house were to burn down, I probably won’t remember to grab the draw with the piece of paper in, but the steel would survive.

I like the part where you said “earn money” ��

What’s the benefit of running your own node?

Tbh I think you may have sold the trezor to me on this point. I was so focusing on how to secure the thing that I overlooked how to securely create it in the first place!!

Use Coinbase Pro, not regular Coinbase. Still free and the fees are 0.15%-0.25% rather than 3% and the market rates are lower too. 
You can just move the coins back into your regular Coinbase / another bitcoin wallet.

Almost certainly but the q wasn’t “what is the best anonymous way to send coins”.
