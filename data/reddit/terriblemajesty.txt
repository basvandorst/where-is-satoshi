Today’s dip is the tip of the iceberg- if it dipped as low as it did last week on a rumour - A BLOODY RUMOUR. it will tank hard STRAIGHT TO HELL on actual news that South Korea will be taxing their people 20% and up for cryototrading. I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC fall to under 5k
Despite this
I still believe in BTC 
It’s just gonna take time for it to recover - like at least 2-3 months maybe even 4. By next year this will be ancient history and we will see record ATHs once more and even the speculators who are shorting it will take a huge loss and become believers. It will once again become an
UNSTOPPABLE JUGGERNAUT

It's all based on sentiment and FUD. Price should go up again to normal levels by next week. HODL if you were not able to sell at a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:07:28
Buyers are all being forced to wait and sellers being forced to HODL...all in all bad for business as there is a huge flatline....
Only good thing to come out of this is if the price crawls back up to pre dip levels (17k CAD/BTC).

speculators. BTC needs to adopt lightning to lower transaction fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:52:22
BTC is the Godfather of crypto but the more I learn of the other one that rhymes with meth, it looks like that may surpass BTC one day in the next 5-10 years
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:47:52
never sell during a dip. always buy low sell high.

BTC is the Godfather of the cryptos. It goes up, everything goes up and vice versa. 
However, I buy LTC bc the transaction fees are next to nothing compared to BTC.
I am trading LTC in order to buy BTC.
ETH is incredibly diverse, the more I learn about it, the more i see its potential. It may be in some ways superior to BTC, and we can see that it is already reached more than half the market cap of BTC! 
BTC and ETH are here to stay and we may see something of a rivalry between the two in the next 5 years...

Expert analysis! XD
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:29:25
Most of us ran out of money.
Plus if you look at Bitcoin in January it almost always crashes at the first two weeks of January. Also Christmas shopping and people having to pay their debts. Also lack of confidence in the crypto markets. The confidence has fallen somewhat but will be ready to rise once the price reaches pre crash levels and then most of us hodlers will be able to re enter the trading arena

Anyone thinking of buying right now - don’t. Wait. Until Thursday and Friday then see where we stand. We are going to hit lows we haven’t seen  since last year.
Buy right before the weekend. Stock market will have zero effect since they are closed on the weekend and the news cycle is usually dead by then and if not completely dead is very slow
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:43:23
yeah i strongly disagree with this. if you dont know what you are doing, you will lose money in crypto. if you know what you are doing, you will still lose money in the stock market. its full of veterans whereas the crypto market is full of n00bs with weak hands.
it took me over 2 years in the stock market to make what i made in 1 month in the crypto market
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:00:11
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:54:00
You nailed it. That’s exactly what they are doing. They want to monopolize bitcoin and take it away from the people in order to drive the price lower. and then they will manipulate the price and drive it higher. 
We will know this is their endgame once they change their tune and all that FUDdy Duddy fake news bullshit and start singing the praises of bitcoin and sucking its figurative Bitcock
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:04:00
THIS. Bitcoin is a steal. We know its true value is at least 100k at the most 1mil. 
The fact that it will be limited to 21 million means it wont be subject to inflation and it ensures its value will only increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:02:31
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:48:24
thanks. what does this mean? that they wont be able to speculate on bitcoin anymore? or will they have to renew it? i sure hope they dont lol but then the price will skyrocket once again
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:01:15
It's helped in all areas of my life
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:18:51
its not a magic ball lol.
its just learning to read the graphs. technical analysis.
i cant talk numbers here but if you look at the recent previous dip, that is where we should all be buying. and then we set the sell price to TEH MOONZ. or just anywhere higher than where you bought it/
see yall later

I've been a stock trader for over 10 years. I've switched to crypto trading and it's like hyper trading. It's much more enjoyable than being a slave to the work force in some corporation
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:51:39
Yeah. Dip is done for today. That was an exciting ride! Ended up buying a bunch of LTC at the lowest price i have ever bought at.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:48:52
the answer is YES. nothing is free
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:08:20
Im going to bed I will check back here later today and then tomorrow and see what happens if it drops further or not (it will most likely drop)
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:53
it isnt too late lol. even if it is worth a million right now, still wouldnt be too late. i just started learning and im over 30. made a hefty amount since i started crypto trading last year
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:24:39
this is FUD

agreed. i just started watching videos and what fool i am
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:01:44
it isnt a fixed pattern but more or less it seems to have a steady drop from Sunday to Friday and suddenly has a surge from Friday evening to Saturday evening.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:49:04
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:36:11
there are going to be discrepanices depending on which site you use, but the point is, it has gone up at least 1000$ since the crash/dip
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:26:09
wait...is this a FUD site? or a pro bitcoin hodl to the moon site
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:59:55
They can try but they will fail. They have already tried and failed multiple times. BTC is here to stay unless an EMP bomb goes off and wipes out all electricity and computers.

@_date: 2018-01-22 16:08:56
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:21:18
agreed. especially if you bought too high. its best to just hodl and let the market recover
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:24:03
Buy when it reaches maximum dip then hodl to your hearts delight

Actually I haven't been tracking it long enough to see that specific annual pattern. But THANKS! That is a VERY STRONG DEFINED pattern indeed!
Just noticed those are 3 month charts...nevertheless there is a strong argument to be made that it DROPS HARD in MID JANUARY. 
I hereby declare January to be  FIRE SALE MONTH!!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:49:54
It happens once a year confirmed!

Quadriga CX trading site is down. Servers overwhelmed. Can't do anymore trading till back up. Before this happened, whenever i try to cancel an order or submit one, there was either lag, would get frozen, or simply would not respond. Anyone else having similar issues?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:39:19
Congratulations! You’re on your way. Just HODL and come back in 10 years. That 0.1 May very well be worth as much as 10k
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:58:31
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:14:14
I think the speculators have prevented an astronomical rise ever happening in the future (barring 2 reasons that i made a recent post about).
If I were to bet actual money on where the price will be by the end of the year, realistically, I say it will most likely peak at 40,000$.

I am trying to buy and sell but the site I use as my primary is down (QuadrigaCX)
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:09:21
i also started with x amount. ended up with double
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:04:58
Their charts are showing a flat line...on my blockfolio app...better not be a MtPox situation
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:37:44
I'm on the same boat. 
I bought BTC back when it was worth just under 10k CAD so like 7k USD lol
I was forced to HODL because i didnt know you could even trade it lol
I eventually sold it when it reached over 20k...
And now I am learning how to buy the dip and sell the peak. Stock trading 101. Buy low sell high.
These dips are so unpredictable and come at the worst times for me since i have started trading crypto. 
Its been almost two months and its stressful as heck.
Ive recently discovered you can set alerts and that has made things a bit less stressful...meaning i dont have to be watching charts every minute of every second of every day...
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:29:06
In the same boat amigo. This reddit really helps to HODL and not lose my cool . Thanks  for your post!
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:22:31
the big investors and banks are waiting for it to dip so that they can buy it all up and drive the price down or manipulate the market even more than now
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:45:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:15:28
My understanding is that the reason for the recent dip is the contention between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash camps.
If that is indeed the reason, this is a fire sale and the true value of Bitcoin has not diminished. 
This will be an interesting discussion a month from now when the price for 1 BTC has gone back up to over 20k USD.
When in doubt, zoom out.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:22:51
I’m hoping I am wrong...but those bloody speculators are truly bastards who want nothing more than 
1)  To see BTC fail
2) Buy lots of BTC for dirt cheap or next to nothing when the price drops because of their dastardly actions
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:18:26
After that from Tuesday to Friday it’s very hard to predict...the only pattern that is nearly consistent is the Friday to Saturday rise - I henceforth coin it BSB, or, the “BLACK SABBATH BUMP” and the Monday fall which I call - WSW or, the “Wall Street Wreckingball”.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:13:41
Yeah I noticed it is starting - it will be interesting to see the price at 8-9 am EST when the NYSE opens
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:05:48
So much animosity. I’m a fellow investor. I.e. Bullish in BTC. Not a shorter. Take my advice or not. It’s up to you. I’m trying to help because I understand it is difficult to try to make a substantial profit from BTC since the speculators. There’s no need to be rude about it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:12:25
It’s called reading the charts - understanding the charts - knowing the support and resistance levels - I’m still a newbie but take my advice or don’t - it’s up to you
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:10:55
It’s simply technical analysis. All the cryptos rise from Friday evening to Saturday evening and tend to drop beginning Monday morning. This has been the trend since the speculators entered the game and thus changed the crypto world forever. They are holding crypto hostage so to speak and hampering its growth. It’s good and bad.
It’s good because if it weren’t for the speculators BTC would be probably over 50k and unaffordable but bad because of hodlers who are waiting for it to rise back up to the pre speculators levels...aka the all time high levels
Tl dr it’s good for traders bad for hodlers 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:25:34
