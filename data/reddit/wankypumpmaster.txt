The way you passively slander people with differing perspectives matters.

It's European culture versus other culture. Travel the world and see the differences for yourself

Sure that can be a cause too. 
But what's the solution? 
Surely it is not calling people who point out the inconvenient truth racist and ignoring what is happening. 
So let's not get distracted from the original point.  The CDC is not racist. Stating facts does not automatically make one racist. You have to find a problem before it is solved. Ignoring problems will not get resolved.

Yes also curious as to why you believe Breitbart is racist. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:13:24
Cool, more personal attacks. 
I win you lose.

Loaded questions here. I can't respond for all of the internet and how the statistic is used but hear me out. 
My original post was in response of the Breitbart is racist debate. 
Someone spoke of a black crime section, which does not exist by the way. Maybe he was referring to a black crime article? Anyway, I posted a report by the CDC. Using this to show the hypocrisy of labeling a media outlet racist for reporting on facts. 
These facts are important and are not inherently racist. These facts should invoke anger. Homicide is the 5th leading cause of death for black males. This is wrong. This problem should not be ignored and hidden because it offends some. It should be addressed and resolved.

Yes, more funding for education could be helpful. 
In some states I know they are already heavily aiding underfunded school districts. 
I'm an advocate for voc tech schools. We could use less poly sci degrees and more electricians.

I just want issues to be discussed without labeling one as racist. I believe that term is often a cop out used to avoid dialect and to suggest Moral superiority. 
And I agree that Breitbart has an agenda. Just as CNN does. Just as bbc does. Just as Fox News does. There is no such thing as unbiased reporting. That is why collecting information from various sources, taking that information in critically and dialect is important

Sure that may be a cause as well. 
Now many of the popular leaders in black culture are/were gang bangers. Do you believe this also negatively impacts the black community?
But now it is 2018. How many generations must pass before change prevails? You can't change the past, but what can be done today to change the future?

Blacks are more than 10x more likely to commit homicide than whites 
CDC is mad racist yo

Can you see no cultural differences when you travel? 
I've lived in Germany and saw first hand how the Muslim cannot fit into western culture. They grope, they rape and they kill. 
I like your optimism. But at the same time don't be naive. Why do you believe that today there shall be no war and only peace between clans? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:32:22
I agree with you. I believe it is in large due drug and gang violence. 
But this is a cultural problem within the black community that should be addressed. Homicide is the 5th most likely cause of death for black males. 
It is asinine to pretend these problems do not exist or to call anyone who brings up the elephant in the room racist. 
"In 2014, the most recent year that a county level breakdown is available, 54% of counties (with 11% of the population) have no murders.  69% of counties have no more than one murder, and about 20% of the population. These counties account for only 4% of all murders in the country.
The worst 1% of counties have 19% of the population and 37% of the murders. The worst 5% of counties contain 47% of the population and account for 68% of murders. As shown in figure 2, over half of murders occurred in only 2% of counties.
Murders actually used to be even more concentrated.  From 1977 to 2000, on average 73 percent of counties in any give year had zero murders. Possibly, this change is a result of the opioid epidemic’s spread to more rural areas. "
This shows how violence is concentrated in specific areas.

"In 2015, homicide rates were 5.7 deaths per 100,000 for the total population, 20.9 for non-Hispanic blacks, 4.9 for Hispanics, and 2.6 for non-Hispanic whites. "
Blacks are more than 10x more likely to commit homicide than whites

True. 
What I really want is to ignore politics all together. Just research a week before elections and move on with life. That was the most fulfilling. We don't get paid enough to care about these things.
