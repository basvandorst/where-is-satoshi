because, here on planet earth we still live our lives with FIAT.

My motto is only take the cash when you're happy it is going to change your life enough.
Right now, I could cash in on my bitcoin and have doubled my money.  I could go on a nice holiday.
But...  I could go on a nice holiday with the money I earn.  If I lose all of what I have in Bitcoin I won't notice it, my life will not change.  Sure I'd be upset I lost it, but I'm currently living my life not using that so if it vanishes I won't be upset.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin flies up to the moon and it ends up paying off half my mortgage, that's changed my life significantly and for that I would perhaps then decide to cash it out, as I would be satisfied it's changed my life enough that in the future I won't regret my decision.

I see, sorry for asking that question, just seemed strange to me that you didn't just think "Well I can't afford £200, but I could afford £50" and then go with £50 worth for that point.
Obviously, in all of this, hindsight is a key element.  At the time, I didn't get any bitcoins either, when it first started I tried to set up my PC to mine and I couldn't figure it out so I just said fuck it and left it alone...  
So I can see how you could potentially do a similar thing but instead of time spent figuring shit out, it was more like I can't really afford £200, so fuck it I won't bother.

Why 320 or nothing? That doesn't even make sense.
If you think you could possibly afford 320 to the point you're considering it and then you just don't buy any at all? 
Couldn't you just spend like what you could afford on it?

I mean, I didn't mean to put /s at the end because I was very obviously taking the piss.
thanks for looking out for me though

Just rounded up my bitcoin to exactly 0.10000000, satisfying to look at compared to the previous 0.096374653 it was before.

haha cheers!

Exactly, for me the worst thing about CP is that it can only be produced one way and it's utterly disgusting to ever put a child through that.
As for the art side of things, sure - that's a gray area but I think there's a difference between simply showing a child naked and making it pornographic.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:24:02
That's quite a few pennies
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:56:33
No because when I said generated images, I meant images that aren't real children involved.  You know, cartoon images or even 'realistic' 3d rendering.
Generated heroin, is just heroin.

Yeh I think I will buy it back
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:56:45
Without more information, that sounds incredibly stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:10:04
Wouldn't worry about it too much, 500btc would only be worth approx $6million now.  Not life changing at all.
You probably got more enjoyment from the drugs
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:48:35
It's only my opinion, but I just think if you have easy, legal access to 'fake' CP that opens the door, quite easily, for that person to 'discover' or 'develop' a liking for such material, which could then lead to them seeking 'real' CP which certainly should remain illegal.
I see the point, there is no victim.  I understand that point, but my reasoning is that I don't quite like the idea of what it could lead to.

Stupid question from my stupid actions.  Was at work, guy made me panic sell my 0.1 bitcoin for £510.  It's now back up to £578.  Pretty annoyed I let someone panic me into selling.
Should I buy back now at 0.85, hope it drops closer to 510 or pay an extra £70 or so and pretend it never happened and get it back to 0.1 now
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:59:15
While a painting doesn't, generated images being legal could normalise CP and make the wrong people believe it's not that bad.  Which, could lead to them seeking out real CP and therefore, again it contributes to the CP market as an advertisement, in a sense.

I normally ignore him, not sure why I panicked this time.
@_date: 2019-12-23 10:11:46
Originally was just going to hold it, I still have the money from selling in my coinbase account so it's not really money I'm going to lose.  It was lost when I originally bought it at £600 or so, I'd call it medium term as I would like it to get to a value I can do something meaningful with it, £500 will just get sucked up into my bank balance and be forgotten about.
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:36:47
Thanks.  What's the answer then if it's so stupid.

Yo, what's up?

Or maybe, you know, his wife just talks about her husband to her friends like normal people do?
Why does everyone have to have bad intentions all the time.
