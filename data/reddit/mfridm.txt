Well we could in theory also move over to an inflationary crypto. I agree on your take on daily trading, but not when we are talking about assets and investments. No one recommends holding on your bank account, but there are plenty of options here

What about an inflatory crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:47:37
Sure, and I completely get why people would chose deflationary options. Im more curious about the societal effects and if its actually preferable as a whole

How is it more fair? Wont the rich simply get richer, without the need to actually invest in something that may benefit others as they sort of have to do now?

That really wasnt what I meant.. What are you basing your statement on anyway?
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:41:39
Interesting take, however I dont feel this is very conclusive. Are there any actual real world cases where deflation was a good thing?

Thank you, this is right on the money with what I have been thinking about. Im all for cryptocurrency, dont get me wrong, but I am struggeling to se how a deflationary system creates more equality

Of course there is a risk. No one knows what is going to happen, No matter how convincing they sound. Spread your investments and dont invest more than you can aford to lose.
There is definietly a big upside here, but things can still happen in the future that would affect the value of bitcoin negatively beyond recovery

Thanks for a great answer. Very interesting to see where this leads, as the deflationary part itself really creates incentives for adoption

I completely agree with you there. I definietly believe this shift is happening. Im more uncertain about the consequences, especially on a societal level

Is this with JPM actually true? Any sources?

Exactly! how relevant are these type of use cases for the average person? Bitcoin can will shine when it handles standard purchases better that mastercard from the consumer perspective, not when its better at a fringe case like this

He is probably sponsored by E-toro, you see their logo in the picture. Just heard their Commercial in a podcast and it was all about bitcoin
