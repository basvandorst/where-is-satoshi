No, not investing IN gold, investing THEIR GOLD, like in the middle ages, way before we had inflation. Business has always been around, jobs have always been around. 
People aren't spending bitcoin because it's really hard to spend. We are all lazy. That will change as bitcoin gets easier to spend. 
As it is, people cash out to but their home, pay of student loans, take their mom on a trip. They might not pay with bitcoin, but they cash out for it, so to them it's more important than the increase in value. The evidence is literally everywhere, I don't know how you can't see it.

I went through his post history, he does NOT seem generally hostile to me.
To me, it looks like he cares about Bitcoin (his post/comment history supports this) and is a bit impatient with people that fuck around.
His question is valid. What have you done so far to help the project to clear the mempool? Because he's posting regularly on it, and trying to educate and inform people. 
You might not understand this, but it's important. The mempool won't just clear itself. We need to do better.

There will always be people that are willing to cheat to win. Humans are greedy. If you make the system ironclad, they will rise to the top and create loopholes for themselves and their friends... Just like with government.
Regulation needs to be built into the system, and be simple, and perfect. That's how, with game theory, bitcoin solves the trust problem.

You're correct. 
He bought a service at a dollar value. Period. He simply paid in bitcoin. He even phrased it that way.
He's arguing for the increased fiat value of his bitcoin... But he wants the original amount of bitcoin back.
The service was never valuated in bitcoin, probably because bitcoin is currently volatile.

Yeah, manipulation requires control. I think there's more to it than just selling, though. I think there are some fancy bots that drive the price down with specific bidding patterns too? Or maybe drive the price up with bidding patterns, can't be too sure.
But shorting doesn't require manipulation. That's all I would point out I guess.
Without control it's literally gambling  though, so people need to understand that.

I'm not arguing this, I believe that is how it works. 
In my head, I use "expiring" for the natural planned end of the channel, and "close" for the premature end... But I realize that I'm being vague and apologize for that.
People that wish to use bitcoin as a currency (aka use it frequently) WILL need to make two on chain transactions at least once per maximum duration of the channel. Hopefully that can be years. I don't know if there will be an extension function yet, but I imagine there will eventually be and chat can come down even further.
The estimated max population of the earth is 12 billion. Lightning can probably handle unlimited, instant, decentralized transactions for that number.

It all depends on how LN gets implemented/adopted, and how frequently peeps are closing their channels.
If channels can remain open in perpetuity, and there are ways to buy BTC directly on the second layer (exchanges/atomic swaps) with our current 7tx/s max we could probably serve over 100 million people.
And that's only 2 orders of magnitude below the likely max global population of 10 billion.

@_date: 2018-01-12 00:56:22
The correct math should be number of channels to the number of hops exponent.
ie. 5x5x5x5x5... 20 times.
5 hops with 20 channels/hop is 3.2 million. 20^(5).
20 hops with 5 channels/hop is 5^(20)... Significantly more.
So without counting the sender or receiver, 5^(18) = 3,814,697,265,625

I think most westerners (North America, maybe even some of Western Europe) have a hard time imagining the market forces of Asia.
Take the most populous city in the United States, New York City at 8.5 million people. There are over 150x that many people in China.
The population of China's 10 most populous cities is half of the entire population of the United States.
I also think that there's a lack of understanding of how important generosity is in Chinese culture around this season. It's expensive! 
And further, "market cap" isn't a bank account. It's not like you sell a bitcoin for 12k and that 12k just comes out of the account.
When tens of thousands of prospective buyers STOP BUYING because they are arranging travel plans or shopping for gifts or putting money in red envelopes, that can VERY quickly drop the prices.
A lot of people just don't understand the system.

A NON contentious, majority hard fork is very common in cryptocurrency. Monero hard forks fairly frequently to update the network.

SegWit is awkward because the reduction in transaction size is small, and only happens is both parties have SegWit addresses. The benefit COULD be large for everyone, but it requires everyone to make an inconvenient change for little gain. This is a poor incentive structure.
Lightning is different because the change in fee is HUGE, and the on-chain transaction size is basically zero. It still requires both parties to be using Lightning, but the massive upside more than offsets the challenge for large players, in my opinion.
Hopefully the big players see this and are convinced to start testing lightning! ��

It was probably someone with access to the network voluntarily downloading a keylogger and essentially HANDING the password to the thief.
It may or may not have ever been targeted, my guess is that it wasn't. It's probably a mass audience strategy and they just hooked a big fish.

Or people will start aggressively buying the dip, and it'll just skyrocket the coin.
Once the value multiplies a few times, volatility should decrease.

You don't need to close the channel, ever, unless you need to do a grounded (off-lightning) transaction.
And seeing as we will have atomic swaps for currency exchanging, and near-zero (theoretically!™) transactions in the same currency... Why would you want your bitcoin grounded?

Lightning is most beneficial for those that are making many transactions. The more transactions, the larger the benefit.
I see this helping the larger players the most; exchanges, traders, etc.
However, as soon as that large bulk of transactions is taken off chain, the mempool will clear and transaction costs will go down for everybody.
It's a PERFECT *individually incentivized*, yet *collectively beneficial*' system.

It's a necessary step for lightning.
If all of the major exchanges ran nodes and opened channels to each other, they could probably reduce the number of transactions on the network by... Pulling a number out of my ass... a third? That alone would erase the backlog for a very long time.
It would be lower with atomic swaps!

What? What size transactions are you expecting people to make on lightning? 
Any lightning node could theoretically hop twice, right? As every transaction will appear to be **20 hops** long, and all transactions are encrypted... How would you reverse engineer that? 
Even if nodes only had two channels, it would still be hard to trace a route. With 4 or 5 channels, I doubt it's realistically possible.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:13:04
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:44:28
No problems, no difference functionality or security wise, in that sense everything is fine! 
Your transactions will be larger though, and thus more expensive, and you can't use lightning with a legacy wallet.
But until you plan on making several transactions with your wallet, it makes little difference.

Lol, chill out bro.
Pick a single argument instead of hopping around. You're sounding like a crazy person.
We can discuss what Satoshi wrote in forum posts in 2010, or we can discuss what was written in the white paper years earlier. But they are not the same, and are different arguments.
As of right now, financial instructions aren't handling any meditation, are they?   *But it's in the white paper, so let's get some financial institutions involved, stat!* /s
Now, you're right about my error, half asleep last night I wrote the wrong username, which I've fixed. But it makes no difference, it DOESN'T make it Satoshi. And Satoshi DOES say:




Now, "anyone with a fucking brain" can read that and see that "needing it" is subjective.

And the seller is either a business, which means they are a public entity with an identity to care about, and don't want to fuck that up (like newegg, or Amazon)...
Or an individual that you found through a website like ebay, or Craigslist, where some kind of ratings system appears.
It's great to have a trustless system, but in human interactions there will always be some amount of trust. 
Trust makes things easier. It makes interactions fluid. This is what con artists abuse to make their money.
But as long as we have accounts, and ratings, and ways to vet each other, people will tend to be more honest than not. At least, I think they will.
People have been getting conned for millennia, and I doubt that will stop with bitcoin.

You aren't understanding, though, that you won't need to open or close channels very often.
There's a vast reduction in the number of transactions that each person does, because instead of each transaction being on the chain, only a fraction of them are.
This also reduces the cost and delay of each transaction to near zero.

It's so accurate.
A friend of mine was asking about crypto, and he said "it's so volatile, how do you know it's not going to crash?"
And I basically said that he wasn't ready yet. It will crash. If you're already worried about the crash then this isn't for you.
The only way you actually lose money is if you sell or trade at a loss. Just commit to never selling down, and you'll be fine.
If my friend had bought I have no doubt that he would have panic sold.

If you spend in USD, and HODL your 0.2BTC, you essentially ignore the bitcoin network completely.
If you spend in bitcoin, you aid adoption, even if you just save your $3k USD.

I agree with you, I wouldn't blame Airbnb. This is just capitalism in action. There is a limited supply of desirable living space, and thus it gets purchased by those with available wealth and is used to earn returns.
I mean, it's a large point of contention, and I get it. On the one hand, free market. On the other hand, it's arguably bad for the city/area.
Where I live we are running into problems with extraordinary inflated real estate prices, paired with low municipal budgets. This is because a significant percentage of buyers are foreign buyers, leaving the houses vacant, or living here but earning all of their money in a different country, and not paying income taxes to my country.
I think people blame AirBnB because they are all easy scapegoat. They are public. But really they are just offering the service, the demand was already there.

One is a feature of the network (transaction/tx fee) and one is the exchange making profit (surcharge).
Often exchanges call their surcharges "network fees" to pretend that they aren't responsible. But they are.

That's okay, you don't have to. There shouldn't have to be an argument. There have been many other bitcoin forks that were happy to coincide with bitcoin without going to war. I would VASTLY prefer it if all the drama just stopped. But, because a group won't stop attacking bitcoin, this alt coin is a problem. And it should be addressed appropriately.

I don't think anyone is saying this fee situation is good. It's not good.
The fees are holding back adoption. We can agree on that.
We disagree about the scale of the problem, and on the solution. 
In my day to day life I don't have opportunities to spend bitcoin... So fees really aren't a problem for me, or for most people living near me.
However, I am looking forward to LN to since all fee and scaling issues for the foreseeable future, and the upcoming storm of adoption that will happen, probably using the trust that people have in the Bitcoin name.
I do not think this attack is coincidental. I have a feeling that LN is way closer than people think.

The fee disincentivizes usage. It is competing for a place in the block.
It is high because there is more demand than supply. Because people are using Bitcoin. And it rises because more and more people are using bitcoin DESPITE the fee.
So, to say that the fee makes bitcoin useless is nonsense. It's still very used.
The fee makes is LESS likely to be used as p2p cash, which is something that LN will solve soon.

I'm not getting where people are imagining this fee issue comes from. $20!?
I'm consistently sending at 50sat, 70sat, getting into the next block.
You just have to check [Johoe's Mempool stats]( and figure out what it's gonna take to get into the block.
Fees are like $1.50, $2. I'd way rather use BTC than fiat.
And Segwit will help, if Steam adopted it instead.
I have a hunch he-who-must-not-be-named is involved.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:49:55
Learn about bitcoin. You don't need to be paying fees like that.
The wallets set fees automatically, but if you learn about the mempool you can manually set fees way down. I generally transfer between wallets for $1.50, and it's dropping.
These past couple of days have been an exception with the backlog, it looks like the transaction spam is back. It'll pass ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:58:22

No, I wouldn't rather that. That's a reductio argument and has nothing to do with what I've said. I did accept that 'weak hands' will move to an alt.
I've had a bit if an arc on this fee thing. I'm at the point where I'm not too defensive to admit it's a problem anymore. It's not good. But these are, in my opinion, necessary growing pains.
And my answer is yes, I prefer these fees than forking or changing currencies. For now, I prefer to wait, and obviously many people agree with me.
But I understand that other people don't agree, and that's fine. What I don't accept is people trying to make me wrong for my decision. That's nonsense and I'll stand against that kind of offensive and illogical drivel.

Actually, by definition, if you're revolutionary you would be moving away from fiat altogether.
Or rather, moving to BTC as fiat, fully adopted currency.
I would love to see tap interfaces for BTC microtransactions by 2020, so that I can just pay for transit, grab lunch, pay for groceries, all with a simple motion.
I think that LN will afford that.
Even if I keep getting paid in fiat, I'd love to be able to hodl and spend directly in BTC.

I don't support BIP 148, I support SegWit adoption by a large exchange.
To be clear, I'm under the impression that SegWit is the technology, the wallets, and BIP 148 is a contentious-hard-fork-type-action, wherein miners stop accepting non-SegWit wallets. Yes?

Metcalfe's law, for future reference. It goes something like: the value of a network is proportional to the square of the # of users multiplied by the average value of a transaction.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:23:40
I was reading about this recently.
Bitcoin has a daily churn of something like 11 or 12%, with average transactions in the $80k range. That's insane.
As adoption improves and the overall market cap increases, and especially after systems like lightning are properly utilized, we will (I think) see the volatility decrease.

I've never used bread, but there should be a place in settings to adjust the transaction fee. If you disable "dynamic" fees, and reduce the fee to like, 70 sat/byte, it should let you do it.
70 sat/byte is still like $1.50 for the transaction though, which is high. Why are you sending the $5?
In Electrum I can reduce the fee all the way down to 5sat/byte. I haven't tested it, but it would be super cheap!

Let's say you're going to buy a new monitor.
You're spending the money anyway, right? 
The question is: do you buy with Bitcoin, or with your credit card? PayPal? 
What he's saying is that you're better off buying with Bitcoin, and then spending the fiat you would have spent on the monitor replacing the Bitcoin instead.
The end result is equal (actually better for the retailer, much better, as they don't get hit with 2-4% by the credit card companies) and you are supporting Bitcoin adoption.
If everyone did this, Bitcoin would be growing even faster.

It's a valid concern, but mining still generates lots of coins.
Many miners are mining "at a loss" (speculating) because of the inevitable growth of the coin value.

Less than you'd think.
Bitcoin is currently almost exclusively used as a speculative investment. That's NOT going to stop once second layers make transactions instant and feeless. It's only going to accelerate.
I don't have numbers for you, but bitcoin is just digital p2p cash. It will will be able to replace fiat for international money transfers, all cash transactions, all savings, DAO investments with smart contracts (essentially think a bitcoin stock market with built in governance). AND, people will bank on bitcoin growing so it will continue to be a speculative tool.

You're doing a kind of thinking that will lead you to feel depressed.
There's this logical concept that I can't fully explain, but basically - you didn't do it differently, so you couldn't have done it differently.
We like to hold on to the belief that if "only we knew" or if we "weren't so stupid" or whatever was different, we would have made the better choice, and things would be better.
Gotta let that go!
You got in at 24 and out at 5600, that's like, 233x
Then you got halved, and you missed a double. So you're off by 4x. from what you could have had.
But really, you're only down half on a bet. You made a bet, and lost half. That's fine.
If you liquidate and buy BTC, it might drop and you might kick yourself, with that line of thinking.
We can *never* know what's gonna happen. We can only make strategic decisions and accept what comes.
That's why I'm diverse right now, with BTC, XMR, AEON, and I recently bought into ADA out of fear... but it's turning out for me so far.
I'm not in IOTA yet, but that might be my next step.
But I'm bullish on BTC and XMR. I might be wrong, but I'm doing my best.
Can't stress! Just enjoy the ride. Thanks for sharing, though, it helps everyone keep things in perspective.

I agree in a sense, I don't think the slippery slope argument holds up - if the devs wanted to marginally increase the block size, I would have been happy to go with it. 
But in the end, I side with the devs, the people that really understand bitcoin. I trust that their understanding is more complete than mine. And even if I thought they were wrong, is it wrong enough for me to try to go my own way without them? 
That's just absurd imo.

I'm not sure you understand what I'm talking about. 
Proof of Stake (PoS) will allow miners that also run nodes to earn small fees with near-zero power usage. 
Anyone will be able to run a node and warm small fees, but there's labor involved in upkeep so I imagine mostly miners will do it.
Lightning Network will allow for mass adoption, which means now transactions. More transactions with less fees PER TRANSACTION and less power usage is a very positive for miners and for users.

The thing to think when it comes to ANY coin is: "why another coin, instead of bitcoin?"
A lot of coins are the result of a developer that just wants to print money to fund their creative project. People don't really understand that.
The coin (or token) should be a result of the network, and the whole system should offer an advantage that couldn't otherwise be achieved.
One of the major examples is Ethereum. Decentralized applications could run on the network, and the fees for the computing could be bitcoin. But... Then that would be no money printed to fund development.
Why on earth would Facebook need to produce a coin. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:27:59
The point of sale system should be able to export an itemized list of transactions, times, exchange rates, dollar amounts in digital spreadsheet format.
It should be significantly faster, cheaper and easier than cash.
Even if the company converts the bitcoin to fiat to pay employees or rent or whatever, that should be as simple as exporting a spreadsheet and sending it to their accountant.
Your accountant will love you for sending pre-entered data instead of a shoebox of receipts.
@_date: 2018-05-06 06:17:21
True, kind of. Selling coins back for bitcoin dips their price and pumps bitcoin, which is good.
But accepting an alt coin helps it reach adoption. For ALMOST ANY other coin I wouldn't care, but bcash is a true scam coin. On par with bitconnect. Helping to increase adoption harms all cryptocurrency imo.
Now, also IMO, these insulting posts harm crypto too.
I think we're going through a rough patch in crypto and I hope we come out the other side soon.

Historically, American industry was bootstrapped by slavery. It gave them a huge edge in a new, resource rich environment with no competition except the natives, who were violently decimated. 
Once you have an economic lead, all you have to do is not fuck up and you're nearly unstoppable. 
It's like everyone's favorite boardgame, Monopoly. 
Equitable exchange slows down progress because **you need to pay people**.
So two options - either *don't* pay people (slavery) or print money (inflation).
A close second to *actual* slavery is modern wage-slavery, the existence of which is sort of buzz-wordy and up for debate.

I was explaining to a friend that this means that businesses currently have money that is two years or more AHEAD of ever being earned. The lending industry is operating like a time machine, allowing businesses to earn from the future, and charging interest.
The lure of limitless unchecked growth is strong, but it's impossible.

@_date: 2018-10-26 23:45:16
It's better on the lightning network.
Visa absorbs the risk of fraudulent transactions, while charging you a fee to use their network. With lightning there is no risk to absorb, so the fee is controlled purely by market forces.
It's also an open network, so that is competition within it. Credit card networks are closed, which limits proper competition.

I don't understand what in my post you're reacting to.
I BELIEVE the American tax system is complex because 1) people are corrupt and 2) people try to "get out of paying an extra cent" constantly.
So wealthy lobbyists and politicians craft gaps in tax law to allow themselves and their friends to profit.
Then, the greedy plebs catch on and all abuse the loophole.
So the lawmakers change the laws to correct for the abuses, but sneak in other loopholes because of more corruption.
Everyone is bad. The system is bad. I think I agree with you, if you don't want to 'fall behind', it's your prerogative to pay precisely your tax obligation and no more.
Specifically about corruption, this is just the nature of greedy people. In my optimistic-nihilist perspective, people are greedy and will always be greedy and that's fine. We need to craft systems for ourselves that are corruption-resistant, like Bitcoin, if we want to thrive.

Yes, but they don't say that. They use vague, imprecise language to try to claim that the new fork IS Bitcoin, which of course it can't be, by the definition of the term 'fork', which I'll get to later.


Well I'm glad you can throw game theory buzzwords around, but unless you can explain to me why that matters, I don't care. [The white paper doesn't mention Nash equilibrium.](
[Also, SegWit is supposed to actually lower fees so far it could theoretically become a problem for miners...]( Can you show me how it raises fees? 


Exactly. Fork. Go your own way, which is not our way. Go be your own entity. 
The technology is open source, and free for all, but the brand equity is not open. Not free to take. Stop trying to steal it.

I think this is why BCH is trying to "take over" the Bitcoin brand. If they can steal this level of adoption they can leapfrog all the growing pains that Bitcoin went through.
Unfortunately growing pains are what teach lessons and bring teams together. I think this exposes the weakness of the BCH team.

Two full-time day jobs, one for health insurance and one for the pension. Automatic biweekly savings deductions to a 3-5% annual return investment. Live in a cramped, rundown apartment on the outskirts of town to save money. Take transit, as the 30 hours/month you spend commuting aren't worth the $600 it would cost to own, maintain and operate a car. Besides, you'll need those dollars for your Lambo. Show up early, stay late. Drop the dignity, always work hard and suck up - you need that raise. Try to find a credit card with low fees and rewards points for things that you need, like groceries.

@_date: 2017-11-29 18:34:10
Spending Bitcoin whenever possible and buying back in immediately is the best choice! 
It increases adoption and really doesn't cost you anything extra. Maybe a buck in the transaction, but if you're buying anything of high value that's less than the credit card fee - it's just you and not the retailer paying it.

One of the selling points of Bitcoin is that it fixes the corruption of fiat.
But things like taxes are not precisely problems with fiat, they are the expenses of government and social services. (I'm not claiming this is good or bad, it just is.)
The wealthy tend to avoid taxes by sheltering money (paradise papers) or lobby for tax breaks, or donate for tax cuts, or whatever. Especially using capital gains, which is a system designed to favor the wealthy.
But now bitcoiners have profit to deal with, they are all trying to manage taxes, just like the fiat wealthy of yesteryear.

I'm not sure whether or not you're trolling, so I'll assume you're not. Decentralization IS the major reason. Currency that functions only as designed and cannot be manipulated to benefit the banks. 
Now, many cryptos will be decentralized. But scale is part of what contributes to decentralization. Right now Bitcoin just has the best brand recognition and adoption.


We can't. Bitcoin, like any investment, is a type of gamble. Invest in it because you support it, and continue to support it and spread awareness, use it, promote adoption, and it will continue to grow, even if it gets shorted awfully by coordinated criminal forces.

This I agree with. The distribution of Bitcoin is not even remotely balanced, it's very possibly, even probably, worse than with fiat right now. However, it's not circulating properly yet either. I have high hopes for how it will start to move once adoption improves.
Wealth hoarding, specifically, is very destructive and is a natural human impulse in times of scarcity. Just think about grocery shopping when you're hungry. Eventually, Bitcoin will not be rising in value anymore. There are memes about the future when Bitcoin IS fiat, but once bitcoin is a stable currency of its own, this speculation phase ends. These are the crazy times, but they will end, at least I hope they will.
I don't have an economics degree but I believe hoarding of wealth is a natural sign of the stresses of living with inflating currency. I think it's a behavioral oddity that will end when our system is operating better.
As I said in another post, we need corruption-resistant systems, because humans are greedy. Bitcoin will not be enough on its own, but I think it's a great start.
Now for you:


If improving on currency is not a selling point of Bitcoin, then why use it at all?

Extraordinary evidence? That nullc uses TWO DASHES more than anyone else? [Even when others do it far more as a percentage of their total posts? ]( That's not evidence at all--it's not even circumstantial.
I understand wanting to get rich by flipping your valuable BTC into affordable-but-unoriginal BCH, and then overcome it and destroy it and eat the rotting corpse--that's fine, that's what parasites do. I'm not even being sarcastic, if I believed BTC was going to win I'd be flipping too. And human history is almost entirely hostile takeovers. But I don't like illogical arguments built upon lies and deception.
Did you notice the dashes? Twice in a single post? Maybe I'M nullc! There's *extraordinary evidence* to suggest that I am! Or maybe, just maybe [two dashes is a common punctuation called an "Em dash" that some people like to use.](
NAAAAAH, it's probably a conspiracy.
There were 65 downvoted comments and they are drawing this conclusion from two of them? And they are so certain that they are blatantly accusing the CTO of Blockstream? 
All of this non-logic ought to be embarrassing. If you have tenuous proof, don't pretend it's solid.
These people aren't stupid. I believe it's far more likely that this post is just another intentional attempt to drum up outrage. Outrage is very motivating and will urge the mob onward.

I've been doing a lot of reading about the philosophy of crypto. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just buying into the hype.
I'm pretty sure that digital currency is the future of currency. And there need to be checks and balances in place to make sure that centralized control doesn't lead to abuse of power.
Now, it's entirely possibly that bitcoin is NOT the future. Bitcoin may be the crypto equivalent of the BlackBerry to the future iPhone. Or the Palm to the future BlackBerry. We just can't know.

This is a very important distinction!
Bitcoin cannot be created by buyers. The valuation comes from increased/(or decreased) demand for the limited supply. That requires a sell price that hodlers are happy with.

Even just thinking of it as a "spend" action instead of an "invest" action. How much do you want to "spend" on a bitcoin? How many bitcoin do you want? 
If the answer is "I don't want bitcoin I want lambos", you probably shouldn't be buying bitcoin.

My long term game is to buy as the price declines, HODL, and sell as the price peaks. Literally the reverse of what I did the last time.

Just make a fake temp email, email yourself some bogus email about an in person crypto sale, from a public computer. Send your btc to your ledger at the time stated in the email. Email the fake address a couple of hours later from home saying thank you.
Then keep a copy for tax purposes.
Tell the government you got caught up on the bitcoin drama but that it's obviously going to fail and you sold at a loss.
Declare the losses. Receive tax break. Still be hedged against fiat.

If you've already got bitcoin, sure. But I have several friends that first bought in at 19k and are pretty frustrated.
Never buy because of fomo. Have a plan, buy/trade accordingly, and if it doesn't work, adjust your strategy. If you don't have the patience for that, then dollar-cost-average is pretty much just as good.
And I didn't mean to sound like some kind of pro trader. The most helpful analogy I got during the slow crash was "don't try to catch the knife", so I bought the whole way down as it dropped. I couldn't be happier, no fomo.
I didn't sell at the top, either. I regret not realizing that there was that speculative bubble, but I wanted to believe the explosive growth was sustainable.
I'm in bitcoin and crypto long-term, I'm looking forward to spending it directly, not having to sell it at all. And I also recognize that trading is a competitive PvP game. So if the coin is crazily over valued again, I will sell a bit. And when it crashes, I'll keep buying more.

@_date: 2018-02-26 19:20:38
JUST MY OPINION AND NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE! 
If you believed in bitcoin to 20k, the time to buy was at 6k.
It looks like you're seeing the growth from 6k to 10k and getting preemptive fomo. Don't do it.
Dollar cost averaging is always safer than large purchases. The only time I do increasing buys is as a coin drops - down 5%, buy $500. Down another 5%, buy $750. Down another 10%, buy another $1000.
The ONLY reason I do it is that I have the money to gamble with and I'm confident the coins will rebound. I'm looking at 3-6 month graphs and judging against support lines that I have grown to trust through experience.
So in your case, assume the market will dump for 6 months, do you still want to buy in right now? 
I'd say buy in in small bits. And in that case, why borrow? 
So the short answer is no. But if there's a big correction, and you're prepared in advance, and you have a plan, and you're safe to gamble, go for it. Just make sure it's not impulsive.

Crypto relies on game theory to work.
Game theory pretty clearly shows that if you build a money-printing machine, that selling it is NOT the best decision. The optimal decision is to use it *just* enough to maintain the appearance of real work being profitable to the general public. This doesn't disturb the value of the currency while giving you the largest possible advantage. 
It's totally fair to expect someone to create a money printer (ASIC). So what should the currency do? Regularly fork to make the ASIC a poor investment. 
In my opinion it's just a matter of time before we realize how absurd the mining arms race is and we firm to a different system. Like maybe cuckoo cycle 
(I agree that, given the current climate, the best decision for Nvidia and AMD would be to be heavily invested in crypto mining.)

ASICs are hated by many cryptocurrencies as they simplify and emphasize centralization. Just look at Monero and many other Cryptonight coins forking away from ASICs.
If GPU manufacturers fix the supply chain so that large players don't have an advantage, THAT would aid cryptocurrencies. Anything else is bullshit.
I won't trust Nvidia until they stop this anticompetitive monopolistic business strategy. Which I'm guessing means I'll never support them.

In a world with equality of opportunity this might be just.
In our world this is exploitative.

My hunch agrees with you, but I acknowledge that there's no reliable way of predicting the market.

If you don't try to catch the knife you don't get cut, and you never FOMO. It's the winning strategy.
I set up a spreadsheet with tiers and decided in advance to buy more as bitcoin hit lower and lower prices. The next is 5k, and then at 4k I'm buying double, and at 3k I'm buying double that.
But I'm not even sure it will get all the way down to 5k. And I can't decide if I'm happy about that or not.

...and? 
I'm sure you know this, but your example is from a period of extraordinary inequality. I'm pretty confident you aren't trying to argue that America in 1890 had equality of opportunity... Are you?  A single outlier is meaningless - although I'm sure she was an incredible woman.
[Stanford explanation of equality of opportunity.](
I'm not whining, by the way. The world is extraordinarily unfair and I accept that. I mean, it's easy for me to accept when I'm in the top few percent globally for wealth and quality of life.
I'm just saying that a system that funnels money from the poor to the rich is only "ethical" or "good" in a world with equality of opportunity. We don't have that. There are many people in our country, let alone in the world, that really don't have a chance no matter what they try or how hard they work.

I'm with you. I'd love to see evidence to support his claim. Pretty outlandish.

LOL, I actually didn't even notice that.
Even just "Bit Chute" doesn't sound right. It doesn't sound video content related.

It's just basic human decency. Don't sell lies.
I think the problems start when so many people are living lives already so full of lies that they don't know what's real and what's not. 
My favorite piece of advice: zoom out. It applies to more than just bitcoin charts. It works for politics, relationships, and careers. Basically all stress.
Now I'm just ranting. But anyway, I agree. Stop selling lies, people! Zoom out!
