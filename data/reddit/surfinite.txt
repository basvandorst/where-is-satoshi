I have backups of the original wallet.
But nothing that seems to know about the most recent transaction I made.
I know I did something stupid, but I didn't think that I could lose it all as long as I have a backup of the original wallet.

Thanks for your response again. I modified the end of my question, but you'd already responded.
It's a legacy wallet from about three years ago.
I know I'm flapping like a loon here, and I should just calm down and wait for everything to sync but could you confirm:  
Bitcoin QT will have created address 1MqrY69iy8KAz9LzJqc7L8Ebpa7K82Qbk5 when I first created the wallet, even though I've never seen it before, and it has the private key and data needed to access it even if the backup of wallet.dat was taken, say 3 years ago?

Thanks, this sounds positive.
Yes I have about 3 different backups of the wallet, but nothing that seems to know about the most recent transaction (the one linked above).
So you're saying that Bitcoin QT will have created address 1MqrY69iy8KAz9LzJqc7L8Ebpa7K82Qbk5 when I first created the wallet and it has the private key and data needed to access it even if the backup was taken, say 3 years ago?

I'll try but I've been writing to that drive for a few hours as I'm downloading the blockchain.  I've tried recuva and stuff like that before and it usually never works if you have been writing to the drive since the delete.
OK let me add a little information too.
I first tried to run with -zapwallettxes=1 but (again) I panicked that it was taking far too long as it was going to resync the whole chain before it opened the client.
I have that wallet.dat file which has had the client running with it for a few minutes with -zapwallettxes=1.
The client command line options say:  
Delete all wallet transactions and only recover those parts of the blockchain through -rescan on startup (**1 = keep tx meta data e.g. account owner and payment request information**, 2 = drop tx meta data)
Will I likely be ok using *that* .dat file?

You are of course completely correct
