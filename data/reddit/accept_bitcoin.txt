Sorry if you feel that way. Please explain why this is spam? Merchant adoption is paramount to the success of Bitcoin. The adoption rate is pitiful as most Merchants are afraid to accept Bitcoin for a host of reasons. One of which is they dont know where to spend it.
If you are interested in moving Bitcoin forward take time to let people know how useful it is. You dont have to connect with us, select your own less spamful methods.
Good luck.

My claim is based on the popularity and market penetration of any consumer product / service. No Users, No success. Your Danish example is solid but there is no parallel to Bitcoin. The Danish Krone is woven into the fabric of the community by more than 125 years of *USE* - NOTE *USE* as an official currency. Bitcoin will never be anything near an official currency for any country.

Would Bitcoin be a headline if it were still under a dollar? It became a headline as it rose in value and popularity, even though popularity among the great unwashed was the order of the day. It has remained a popular topic, investment vehicle, trading vehicle, profit centre for exchanges and the occasional headline now with WSJ, CNBC, early investor syndicates and grass-root org's  because of greater adoption and a substantial increase in price.
I agree with you that it will remain incredibly useful but with only 1 million users, adoption will diminish, interest will fade and over time the value will plummet to sub dollar. 
Incredibly useful for sure. Will we send Mom 500 BTC overseas for groceries in the near future?
