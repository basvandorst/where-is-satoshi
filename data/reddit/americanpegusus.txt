You seem butthurt. Keep in mind no one's going to join your cult if you're that rude.
Also, I have no temptation to commit suicide as I haven't lost any money to overvalued crypto currencies (like you).

yes, changing their name will solve the security risks and would not be a sketchy move clearly designed to trick further people into keeping funds there/buying btc

that experiment already ran in the cave man days, sorry. deflationary is actually old style, current fiat is modern.
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:09:39
Agreed! So clueless. Out of all the different crypto currencies, this is obviously the best one, and anyone who doesn't see that is so delusional! Also, join islam!
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:43:39
So delusional I might brag about my non existent wealth online to a stranger while buying into a pyramid scheme! Oops, thats you. 
On the 4th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, 
4 lmaos 3 rofls 2 LOLs and 1 lie about being rich, umad, tootaloo!

Really living up to your name!
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:24:20
Well this will never catch on.

1. What rule is this breaking that deserves a ban?
2. How is this different than PMing people about your CultCoin? I mean Bit-Coins or whatever

Ok, lets say I made AI out of the blockchain. Then what--what specific problem can this solve? Oh, maybe it help you see secret magic patterns in your technical trading candlestick charts! (Ignoring the fact that the time frame for the graph is arbitrary so it renders the entire thing worthless) Don't worry your little brain too much, it's a rhetorical question.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:39:26
Nice, that's like a hundred bucks a coin! You said you're holding four coins, so.. you should be rich in no time! Fuck diversification, the number one rule in finance, definitely stick to your strategy!
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:48:54
I just came with an realization, than bitcoin could become peoples global IPO, think about it, is decentralized, driven by ordinary people, increasing value on people beliefs and values. After all this thinking I can Imagine the magnitude of bitcoin's impact on our future! *takes another bong rip*
*clicks refresh on btc/usd conversion page*
*cries, closes laptop*

People that have made a **lot** of money **definitely** brag about it on the internet, on Christmas.
**I believe you!** ^stay ^mad

"I've been told I was crazy for ideas that pop up on a weekly bases 10 years later on TED etc... always been thinking on a different scale as others and I know the direction this evolution is heading and I'm willing to start backing it now." 
Jesus. Christ. Are you a satirical writer?
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:43:16
ironic, trying to promote a decentralized currency and requiring participants to use Facebook, of all services. good luck with your business model, you seem to have a great perspective on things and have obviously thought this through!
edit: omg I didn't see that this is worth .0005 btc! that's like a dime, right? creating a facebook now! :D
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:59:32
But multisig? Blockchain! Um... Technology!! Future. Haha, bet you feel stupid now.
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:12:48
Hahahaha yeah then he'd be working in a cubicle buying into get-rich-quick schemes like you. He's literally the best investor in the world, whereas you probably don't even break 100k/year. How hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-26 04:02:12
I've just wet my panties wondering what it could be!!!! Plzzzz share 
**MOON MOON MOON MOON MOON**

*buries face in hands*
*looks up, surprised to see it's a serious question*
Well.. erm.. Yeah, sure it would work, it's just that this extremely unspecific and is written like a stoned 19 year old who just took his first CIS AI class.
You can construct AI from any data set. Your idea is no better than measuring the depth of water in a stream every 15 seconds, and constructing a markov network out of it. Boom, AI. Making AI out of the blockchain is fucking silly.
It's one thing to have futuristic ideas (that you think are novel, and in reality every single other person thinks about), but it's another to be able to actually carry them out. I'm going to submit this thread to tomorrow, assuming it hasn't been deleted before then.
Until you have at least an ounce of actual substance, avoid writing these things publicly online unless you'd like to be mocked. Keep a journal or something; it's fun! :) Merry Christmas!
