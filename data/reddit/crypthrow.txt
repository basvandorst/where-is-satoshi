You might want to step back (leave bitcoin subreddits for a few days) and calm down. It's no wonder so many people have their first impression of bitcoin as a ponzi scheme when the currency's followers sound like cult members in their enthusiasm.
At its greatest point, bitcoin will still be inferior in terms of importance to at least 10 past-wheel discoveries.

The post title is a little presumptuous, facts are:
2 months ago the price was $120, $300 would've been considered 'high''
now - $300 would be considered 'low'
predictions? in 6 months $120 could be considered 'high' or $1000 could be considered 'low'

Because bitcoin is so complicated, it's product doesn't work!

I'm not hesitant, but I'm willing to give you a reason why it may not reach 10k/coin - bitcoin may as well be the altavista of search engines or myspace of social networking.
I wouldn't be too surprised if google/facebook appeared in the next year(s), I'd be very surprised if the virtual currency concept gets abandoned though.

It seems like a lot of people don't realize that history shows this strategy as the most profitable one...

i.e. anything can happen, yes (I'm not trying to classify this statement as a prediction, merely stating my opinion)

Some of us hope they will be more laughs to come.

Will the early adopters benefit greatly from recognizing something that has the potential of changing the world before it becomes popular? Yes. Does that make the whole thing a scam? I don't think so.


What's weird about it? It's pretty similar as a concept to regular mining. Years ago you could buy a pickaxe, go to a mine that is known to have gold deposits and try your luck. You can do the bitcoin equivalent today - buy a powerful GPU/ASIC, dedicate it to mining and hope you get lucky.


I don't know why you think it's propaganda. When I first heard of bitcoins they were ~$4-5/btc. I could've easily gotten into mining and probably mined a btc or two or with my crappy hardware over a day/week/whatever if I'd thought I'd be able to use it for something other than buying drugs... I didn't. What I mean is - I could've easily been a part of it, anyone could have. It IS decentralized.


Valid point and something that will need to change before btcs become usable as a currency. Still, this is largely related to adoption of the concept (imo).
I do recommend you read more about bitcoins and how they work, else your statements sound similar to the infamous "Bitcoins are so complicated they could be used by terrorists!".

"they are afraid, because bitcoin will replace them!" circlejirk aside, can anyone explain to me why exactly banks don't like you using bitcoin exchange web sites?
