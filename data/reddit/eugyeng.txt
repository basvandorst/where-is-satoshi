When his sister (with him behind her) had many times passed laws on government money to be used to buy bags of rice and donated to the struggling peasants, some took this as Robbery. But for many of the needy, these are acts of heroism. I am not Thai but i do study abit on Thaksin-nomics.

His opposition has claimed many treasonous acts he has purportedly commit. Let's say he is the biggest criminal. So are we suppose to stop criminals from exploring about bitcoin and blockchain? I thought Bitcoin is for All? To say that we shld stop posting pics of criminals reading abt Bitcoin is utterly unfair, biased and narrow-minded.

Why is this scam post still left on this subreddit?

I guess it Depends on what type of news media any listener will be exposed to. General mass media are controlled/influenced by Gov and higher class elites so will probably report Taksin as against the state. 
Between the yellow and red shirts, those who support Taksin are generally from the rural districts. 
Anyway, lets see what is up his sleeves as for as Bitcoin is concerned. 
More money laundering , i guess. Hehe.

Doesn't all bitcoin merchant processors do that? The merchant accept bitcoin using the processor then the processor converts it to fiat and transfers the fiat to the merchant's bank acct. The merchant would not want to hold the bitcoin due to btc volatility and also needs the fiat to pay for the business expenses.

My report did say that Ginko was a real person and did persuade the Russian Gov to buy bitcoin. Only the February timelime sounded too good to be true...

If u have your private keys, just recover yr bitcoin in another wallet using those private keys. But if u did not right down those private keys, then yr bitcoin is gone as i know.

Agree. One of the main reasons. But to think that just if it is only the Future expiry could cause btc to plunge more than 20% is really sad. I am certain it is a convergence of a few reasons. If i am havjng Futures expiry as top reason, then the Hashwar as the second reason.

Worth it cause I am a Blockchain public speaker here in Malaysia. I made it back many folds just through my marketing of bitcoin mining business.

I bought my initial bitcoin when it halved in 2016, when it was usd600. I keep on mining and buying more. I intend to keep on going for the next 10-20 years.

Fantastic chart. I am collecting more of this kind of long term BTC Price Prediction charts so to compile to YT videos! Yummy!

Good answer. But Why not if the government is a good one for the people? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:45:26
Thank you. Yes it is not a accurate price prediction. Least it is a rough gauge where Bitcoin can be heading.

Learnt way more abt blockchain applications. Blockchain is not just abt decentralization.

I'll bet the rest of the Fast-Food chain restaurants will be eye-ing this. Once the next bitcoin bull run starts, some of them (may be mcdonalds) will start accepting.
