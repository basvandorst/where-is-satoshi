Very suspicious, this is exactly what a Ponzi scheme operator would say.

So instead of putting your trust in something you cannot control, you're putting it in something you don't understand?

The funny thing is that the only people who consider Bitcoin a "technological breakthrough" are bitcoiners. You never hear this from actual computer scientists or cryptographers.

Also the plane was designed by amateurs who only intended it as a concept vehicle. It was then hijacked by libertarians who decided to take off despite the plane having only one engine and no landing gear, and fly it to the moon.

So how is bitcoin any better than a fiat currency in this respect? It's controlled by a small number of miners, and you only trust it because others told you to.

 and  are pretty good

Hmm yes not a single CS or cryptography professional in that bunch, and the most ignorant quotes coming from actual bitcoiners like Winklevoss or Falkvinge, and bonafide crazies like John McAfee. Sort of corroborates my point.

neither can so

And uses it to build essential infrastructure, provide law enforcement, education and healthcare, fund science... What a great deal!

Take a good look at what you just wrote. Every single day some unfortunate fool posts here how their life savings are gone thanks to the crippling design flaws of bitcoin or the culture of fraud that permeates it. And you're trying to handwave it all away.
You'll want to go home and rethink your life.

sounds like he'll soon be managing millions

Since he's smart enough to not buy bitcoins, he's not going to be giving you any money though.

yes and in andorra we fly to our ski chalets in hot air balloons

Deposit insurance, universally accepted payment infrastructure, effective legal recourse in case of fraud?

If the technology is the important part and the currency is just a feature, why should anyone waste money buying the currency?
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:21:37
By the miners, for the miners you mean?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:30:55
This, except for real.

"please just leave me alone" does not make you an extremist, it makes you a childish whiner, and a hypocrite when the first unexpected disaster strikes and it turns into HALP I'VE CHANGED MY MIND I NEED A HANDOUT
