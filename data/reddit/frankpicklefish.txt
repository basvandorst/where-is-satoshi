what was gold worth before there were any people? 
what was oil worth before the combustion engine came around?
if a farmer struck oil on his farm 300 years ago, it was a tragedy!
nothing has intrinsic value. things are only valuable if we decide they are.
Having that ability to transfer money across the world instantly without any third parties or fees is what makes bitcoin valuable.
Thats Just what i usually say.

Wow this is such a cool idea! We could have days where we tip bitcoins around on condition you tip other people. Spread the message to all of reddit. I think its easier for people to understand bitcoin once they have some. Tipping Tuesdays :)

Having lots of jobs isn't necessarily a good thing. We could blow up all the farm equipment in the world and there would be suddenly plenty of jobs available, but then we would be diverting valuable/limited resources away from where they could be the most productive. The goal of the economy is to maximize production, not to create jobs. So in this "consumerist society" people buy things they don't really need which diverts resources away from where they should be going. In the bitcoin world that OP is talking about, people would spend their money smarter, and then some jobs would close and some would open. maybe there would be fewer fast food restaurants and more grocery stores. Who can know what would happen? But when people can save their money, that enables them to spend more on other things. sure, some businesses will close, but that will enable others to open up.

You can buy a computer today, or you can wait a month and buy the same computer for cheaper or a better computer for the same price, and yet everyone still buys a laptop at some point. They are constantly coming out with new and improved phones, and every time there are lines around the apple store. This "deflationary nightmare" doesn't seem to be real to me. It makes sense on paper that deflation causes hoarding, but in real life when you need something you buy it. Worse comes to worst, people will spend their money smarter. That seems to me to be a good thing.

So would a cold storage option be to download electrum, make a wallet, send the bitcoins there, write down the 12 words and then just delete electrum?
