Well there's an increased cost when using CPFP, which I still think is worth it given the person really wants the transaction to confirm quicker.
But in the case of FSS-RBF I don't see much increased cost. Heck, for the majority of use cases there will be no increased cost (same transaction size) at all, since all you will be doing is decreasing the amount of bitcoins going to the change address with no need to add an extra input.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:10:36
Serious question. If there's FSS RBF, which is useful and safe against double spending, what's the point in going full-RBF? @_date: 2015-06-30 19:12:16
Right! I missed that. Either way, I think the increase in cost is worth getting the transaction replaced. Decreasing the utility of Bitcoin will deter many merchants and users which are already difficult to get them to adopt Bitcoin. Satoshi himself has been in favor of zero-conf transactions, and anything other than that is a deviation with little purpose.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:50:16
What higher costs are we talking about, processing power or actual bitcoins? In either case I think processing power is a negligible cost given how a 90% increase to a very trivial process is still nothing. In terms of having to add inputs to the transaction to fulfill the FSS requirements, there's little loss to the user, even if it's doubling the miner fees, which I think is still a little cost to pay to ensure your transaction confirms quickly; what's 0.0002 from 0.0001 BTC?
In the second case of only payment processors being able to accept 0-conf transactions, calling what they are doing a sybil attack is a bit of a stretch. I'm pretty sure the big payment processors are running compliant nodes, which is no way harmful to the network at all. It's a bit of a slippery slope you're going onto here, and there's no proof or reason that payment processors have contracts with big miners since there's nearly zero chance of a well propagated transaction to not be mined and be replaced by a double spend.
Personally, I enjoy having my payments be accepted instantly and I'd definitely be pissed off if I have to wait sometimes up to 40 minutes to wait and use the funds especially if I'm in a hurry. Going full-RBF you will be excluding quite a large amount of already existing use-cases, and I don't think this is something Satoshi himself would have supported. Bitcoin should be evolving as a technology, not the other way around.
Unless you prove that accepting 0-conf transactions is a threat to Bitcoin, neither I nor anyone will support full-RBF.

ANX has already shipped two batches of the cards the past 4 days. Expect reviews popping up very soon.

@_date: 2014-03-21 18:27:52
You are 100% correct. We're still not at that point where big retailers are still not using bitcoins as an actual currency but as a payment method, since they cannot use the bitcoins to fulfill their own liabilities. It'd be naive to think that this is happening any time soon. However, small businesses are starting to do that, at least I do. I run my own small business using bitcoins only, and I keep the bitcoins and use them for my own spending.

I'm well-informed of how complex it is to implement such a feature, however, I personally think the best way to build the path towards scalability is efficiency. That's not just in terms of propagation speed, but as well in blockchain size through pruning or compression.
I'm not saying we ought to ride hover board now, but we should and are building more efficient cars. Plus, building an IBLT is not comparable to hover boards.

How the hell does running a Bitcoin Core clone with some extra untested/less tested features make the network more resilient?
I could agree if it were another reference implementation written from the ground up such a btcd or bcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:09:07
Bitcoin core versions less than 0.10 have already had a warning stating that the version was deprecated.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:28:13
...and no other pool beats F2Pool to mining a valid block on top of the correct one.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:55:30
I was running bitcoin core version &lt; 10 and I just upgraded right now. However, once it ran it didn't invalidate the invalid blocks that were accepted by the old version until just now when the valid chain became the longer one. Is that normal?
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:14:07
I'm not talking about filtering transactions such as low priority/low fee transactions; these are already taken care of. I'm talking about outright refusal to process of transactions due to HOW the transactions are being conducted, or WHO is conducting them.
For example if a transaction with a 0.00001 BTC output and 0.00001 BTC in fees is generally accepted, why would we block a thousand of these transactions by the same user?
In addition, luke-jr's patch includes a blacklist of addresses of who conduct many of such transactions. This is censorship and should be refused.
As long as miners are getting what they need from fees, they are not harming their profitability or Bitcoin, regardless of the nature of how these transactions are conducted.

I've used a prepaid debit card before on uber and I was not charged until I reached my destination, and I could have simply had not had enough funds to cover the fare.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:48:19
What you're calling spam filtering are DoS controls. If two transactions are exactly identical in data, however, one is accepted and the other is not, then that is censorship. You either block all low-value, sufficient-fee transactions, or you accept them all. If the whole network agrees to block all low-value transactions then fine, but apparently no-one or little do agree, as evident by your spam filters not being part of the master branch.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:07:04
Yeah sure.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:34:31
Who are we to determine what's abuse and what is not? If the whole network agrees that such repeated transactions are to be prevented, then okay, implement a mechanism to curb such activity. So far, as long as the network rules allow such activity to occur then it should be allowed until consensus is made to disallow it.
Personally, I already think fees is enough of a mechanism to curb such activity. Assuming there is not a lot of non-spam activity going on, the blocks will still be filled with such spam. Once there is more non-spam activity for whatever reason, a simple 0.0001 BTC fee is going to overtake the spam transactions. In either case, the blocks will still be filled regardless of block size.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:28:09
A small pool with low bandwidth capabilities will simply set their max block size low enough in order to be able to have them propagate faster and compete with larger pools. It's as simple as setting a variable in the bitcoin core configuration file.
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:54:21
Well, regardless of whether we agree that blocking or filtering spam is right or wrong (I personally think that it's fine for non-mining nodes only to filter spam to preserve their resources), what you fail to realize here is that miners are driven by profit only; as such their only criteria for accepting a transaction is how much fees are paid, and they will not care whether a transaction is spam or not.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:04:20
That makes sense. A miner needs to balance out including as much fees as possible with block size as to speed up propagation. Either way, each miner will have the choice of mining large blocks or not given their bandwidth capabilities. Later on once block propagation is optimized all miners should be able to mine the largest blocks possible.
Given that this is the case, why are some core-devs still opposing the hard-fork, also given that most Chinese miners support an 8MB max block size?
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:11:59
Looks like what happened exactly is that the "BTC Nuggets" pool mined an invalid block and F2Pool started building over it without verifying. They produced valid blocks but on an invalid chain. Since the valid chain is now longer, F2Pool should automatically start mining now on the valid chain.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:20:52
Caring about Bitcoin is sticking to the rules and the protocols. Filtering transactions will just give bad press to both the miners and Bitcoin itself, and you have definitely experienced that with the whole Gentoo ordeal. Censorship does not align with the original vision of what Bitcoin is; the whole idea of it is being trust-free, and it being DoS-resistant lies in the network rules, which includes fees.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:14:39
Once the max block size is increased, transaction volume is not going to increase magically, and at the moment you won't find many transactions in the mempool. As such, when there's lots of empty space in blocks, people won't be paying as much fees as now since there's little competition into getting into the next block. So the increased earnings from creating larger blocks won't be much to push miners of smaller pools towards larger pools since the increased earnings are probably going to be less than 1% since fees already account to arround 1% to 2% of the block's reward at the moment.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:52:00
You sure it won't switch over to the valid chain of same height? My intuition says they'll mine over the latest block received assuming their implementation is that naive.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:13:47
Yes, and in a way, it'll be an effective way to force them to fully validate the blocks they're building over.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:22:39
You can't be serious...
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:47:26
They just mined a block on the valid chain causing it to catch up to the invalid one.

Wouldn't it be fun if it's the hacker(s) himself who was able to find this report and leaked it?
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:50:49
Well the problem is the transaction is using many unconfirmed inputs, so it will have to wait for those to confirm first. Those inputs are unconfirmed because they come from other inputs that are unconfirmed and this chain goes on for many transactions. I was able to personally go back about 7 unconfirmed transactions until I reached this [transaction]( Why this is unconfirmed is because is it's input was unconfirmed for quite a while until 4 blocks ago.
Here's the thing. This transaction will either go through after a bit of time, or it will never go through and the transaction will be forgotten and your coins will be safe.
Edit: Many of the shared coin transactions in the chain are showing as confirmed after around 20 hours. So I think your transaction should confirm in a couple of hours too.
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:49:53
F2Pool begins solving an empty block once another block has been found and starts building another block so they do not lose work done while building the block. This is evident by 0-transaction blocks only being a couple of seconds after the previous block.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:18:37
Citation for claiming that pin can be compromised...
Unless you make hundreds of transactions a day, I don't see why it would be inconvenient. Even then you could just plug it in once and configure it not to re-ask for the PIN for a longer than usual period. Plugging in a trezor and putting in your pin to make a transaction takes less than 30 seconds. This "loss" of 30 seconds is totally worth the peace of mind when spending.
If you're really that lazy and want to go with that route of not inputting a pin. You can have a cold storage trezor and a hot wallet trezor with no pin at all. Using that will be no less convenient than using a phone wallet.

Sorry, but your understanding of BIP70 is totally incorrect. Bitpay cannot choose to reject or accept payments through the usage of BIP70. BIP70 is just a method of securely retrieving the payment address and amount such that it cannot be modified using a Man-in-the-middle attack or some kind of malware that replaces the address in the clipboard.
How it works is that instead of the merchant, or in this case Bitpay, giving you the payment address and amount directly though their webpage, opening the possibility for the address to be replaced at any point in time between it being transmitted to your browser until it is pasted into your wallet software, it would instead only give you a secure URL which your wallet software uses to securely retrieve the payment details over an SSL secured connection and can be verified as correct by the user checking the Entity value of the SSL certificate.
After the payment details are retrieved by the wallet, the transaction is signed and broadcast to the network just like a normal transaction. Whether you send the transaction back to the merchant over the BIP70 secure connection or not, is optional. However, you broadcasting the transaction yourself is mandatory. As such, there is not mechanism by which Bitpay can use to reject or censor transactions since the only information you reveal about yourself prior to transaction broadcast is your IP address, which is already the case when you load their webpage.
While I believe the step taken by Bitpay is pretty annoying, I also believe it is quite useful as it will accelerate the adoption of BIP70 by many more wallets, which is definitely a good thing. In the meantime, you can actually fetch the address manually from the payment link using this  which will simulate a wallet connecting through the payment link to initiate a payment request, and it will spit out the payment address for you which you can then use to pay through your favorite wallet.
In addition, I believe Bitpay have taken this step due to the hassle of dealing with lots of people who are sending incorrect amounts, and having to deal with the high transaction fees of refunding payments.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:19:02
There are no privacy concerns that I can think of honestly. I've read Samourai's blog post and it honestly looks like pure FUD. I really have no idea why a wallet's developers would spread baseless lies and FUD. In their blog post:


OpenSSL is a software library and heartbleed was a vulnerability with only OpenSSL's implementation of TLS; nothing inherent with PKI or TLS itself. While, PKI has it's own security considerations, it's still what we depend on for secure web browsing. If it were ever to be broken, then we're screwed either way, whether through BIP70 or just being served the bitcoin address through the web page.


Again, none of that is true for the reasons I explained in the parent comment. I believe they might have mixed up BIP70 with BIP75.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:57:55
If the URL is replaced by the attacker's own URL, the wallet will show in the recipient field the attacker's SSL certificate entity name or domain name instead of the merchant's as in this [photo](
If a hardware wallet implements this scheme, you will be virtually entirely safe from ever paying to an unintended address.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:11:24
You are absolutely correct, some people must have definitely been unable to complete some payments and merchants must have definitely seen a decrease in bitcoin payments as a result of Bitpay's decision. I have personally been forced to move bitcoins from my hardware wallet to a BIP70 compatible wallet to be able to complete a Bitpay payment before discovering this tool. Looking at it objectively and in the grand scheme of things however, this has led more wallet developers to implement or at least consider implementing BIP70, which is definitely a needed step to make payments more secure and user-friendly.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:29:06
According to this [comment]( it does not.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:55:30
Yes, other comments have also mentioned this special URL. I have not tried it yet, but I have no reason to not believe it would work.
Someone else has also mentioned that you can retrieve the address by pasting the link into Electrum's "send to" field.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:50:02
That's interesting to know. I can actually agree with this. I can see how, from a technical standpoint, BIP70 is a bit clunky and could have definitely been better.
BitPay's situation is quite complex as I'm sure they have been incurred extra workload and losses due to the processing of refunds, especially during periods with high fees. By forcing BIP70, they have definitely lost some market share, but at the same time they have virtually eliminated the possibility that the payment amount would be sent incorrectly due to some users who pay directly from some online wallets such as exchanges or something like a localbitcoin.com wallet which deduct a fee from the payment amount.
I've personally been in their shoes, and have opted to solve this problem by allowing the payment to be done on multiple transactions in case the first payment was not enough. Yes, it incurs some losses due to the extra fees from sweeping extra UTXOs but it is marginal increase compared to the total number of UTXOs.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:13:07
This is what I literally meant by that it has it's own security considerations. What's the other alternative though? BIP21 links or just copy-pasting the address? In that case, you're still trusting that website serving the link or plaintext address is secured safely by the centralized public key infrastructure. As I said while not ideal, we have always depended on the public key infrastructure, whether through BIP70 or not. PGP would be much better in terms of security and decentralization, but it is not as seamless as SSL certificates and is anything but a frictionless experience.
BIP70 only brings marginal security improvements against malware on the payer's system. It does not, however, either diminish or improve on the security of the transmission of the payment details as opposed to what we were already relying on. BIP70 is mainly to reduce user input errors and also provide the capability for the payer to include extra details such as a refund address while maintaining the same identity verification security of the merchant's own SSL certificate used on their website.
Also BIP70 is not really part of the bitcoin protocol and it can be easily decoupled from the wallet software. So, technically we are not really bringing any trusted or centralized factor into the network itself.
