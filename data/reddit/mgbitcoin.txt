Nice bike! I bought a 2nd hand superduke last summer with the help of btc. Riding a bike like that has some people wondering.

I see that the term user can have different meanings, when I think of a user I imagine a person who owns at least more than 5 USD, including the hodlers, or are actively looking at bitcoin. I would not see a company as a user.
@_date: 2014-12-02 07:40:13
How typical that they are eager to show the criminal side of bitcoin, instead of the upmars we are working on, all the new companies and amazing things done through bitcoin

You can have a look at: 
Although their price might be a bit low they usually are quite fast. I have never sold any BTC via them, but I normally receive my btc in 30 sec - 1 min

Yes, it's true that ChangeTip is entirely different than bitcoin adoption, however I think it will atleast help to spread the word about bitcoin.

This is exactly what I did as well. I have been reading a lot of topics on the bitcoin subreddit but never felt the need to create an account. Now with the ChangeTip option getting more populair I felt it was the right time to create an account.

Actually it is a good post, I would love to sell the bitcoin I have and buy a better motorcycle. I am now driving a 2001 CBR but if I sell my btc I could go to somewhere from 2007. However thinking about driving that Bentley down to the beach in 10-20 years keeps me from selling. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:54:27
First of all I am not an expert in this but here are my 2 cents for what it's worth. 
The verification which makes it less anonymous is set by our lovely governments, the exchanges must use this strict KYC regulations in order to be allowed to operate. 
I understand that 20% in fees is ridiculous and an off putting aspect. However these exchanges must be able to make a profit in order to operate. I personally have never seen such high fees. Whenever I bought I used an exchange which accept bank transfers and with like 1/2% fees. 
The fast aspect is also due to the exchanges having to follow the laws of our governments. 
All the negative findings that you have were aspects implemented by the government or companies. Bitcoin it self is cheap, anonymous and fast. Yesterday someone transferred 40.000BTC for a total fee of 60 cents withing a couple of minutes. 
I would suggest that if you make these small purchases you could go to Localbitcoins.com and contact a seller in your area. His market add-on should be much lower than 20% and you could get your coins faster and more anonymous.
Hope your experiences did not turn you away from this amazing technology!

MY local Dutch news paper had an article on Bitcoin as well which made me facepalm so hard it still hurts. The problem I see with these positive or negative articles is that they are only concerned about the price. They don't mention any of the core benefits that bitcoin bring.

@_date: 2017-08-16 11:31:34
True, but what I meant was that I prefer to see the improvements and developments instead of the price hype train. Don't get me wrong I understand the importance of a rising price but  I hope people focus more on the benefits instead of the quick buck they can make.

Whenever people hit me with this stupid argument I just say. People said bitcoin as expensive at 5$, 10$ 35$ 100$ 250$ 500$ 1000$ 1500$ 2000$.

This seems like a little bit difficult to do in advance.

For 50k worth of bitcoin  you should not use a mobile wallet but buy a trezor or Ledger nano 
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:49:06
Yea, ideally it would be best if no other persons were involved in keeping a password. I am currently in my early twenties so I do hope I won't have dementia when I am 40 though.

I have been hodling for 3 years now and never sold, but unfortunately I am still a student so I don't have 4k a month laying around to buy btc, do I have to stop calling myself a true hodler now? :(

I just want to give my future cousin a fun gift which has something to do with bitcoin due to the fact im a bit of the bitcoin guy from my family. The parents will provide it with enough books ans tools to succed of that I am sure. The BTC will be an unique personal gift, which is worth more than the monetary value.

But google will help him crack that riddle under 5 minutes and since kids nowadays are goddamn magicians with technology he will have acces to the wallet before he is out of the womb.

It takes a lot of time before fulling understanding Bitcoin. I have been in the scene since 2014, but it still takes a lot of time before understanding new events that are happening. Go watch some videos of Andreas Antonopolous, he explains it rather well! Don't be afraid of a rising price, once you see the bigger picture of Bitcoin price doesn't matter.

Just create a new wallet in Electrum, write down the seed, delete the new wallet and recover it again. Do this until you feel secure about generating your lost wallet. Delete your trial wallet. Make a new wallet (write down the new seed) and send your funds to your new wallet. (check the fees before sending to make sure you are not overpaying)

I got offered btc as a payment during my internship at an exchange in 2014. Unfortunately I needed the money to pay my monthly expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:25:19
My price is a hit higher, like 275,  unfortunately I was only able to buy 2,5 as I am a student  but hodling that long makes you feel so indifferent while your friends are panicking. I just laugh abt the price swings. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:48:25
Depending on the money you have invested in Bitcoin I would advise 2 different kind of wallets. Electrum if you want to store it on your pc and have a small stack of BTC. 
However if you have a large amount in BTC I would advise getting a trezor or Ledger. They are really easy to use and secure. You will get a seed, (which is a string of random generated words) that you can use to recover your wallet in case your device gets broken or lost.

As silly as it sounds but I have no moon. I hope everybody uses BTC in daily life in a couple years. I think the price of BTC is too highly regarded here and always makes it look like a get rich quick scheme.

I am trying to educate myself as good as possible, however with all the fuzz going on about the UASF I am getting a bit confused. As I said in the text above I have placed my coins in a Ledger Nano S (might be that I didn't point this out well enough). 
If i understand it correctly: When the chain split occurs the coins I have in my wallet will appear on both chains. Instead of owning only 2 btc(as of now) I will have 2 btcA and 2 btcB operating on Chain A and chain B respectively. It will then be a matter of which chain will be the most dominant one and will call itself "Bitcoin" while the other chain will call itself "BitcoinClassic" or something?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:28:58
Goddamn here I thought that we had more and more people joining Bitcoin which resulted in the price going up, seems it was just mr Bearwhale who bought himself in again.

You could focus more on the European market, as what I think lacks large exchanges. 
-Implement the way people of a certain country transfer their money. 
- Translate the website to the other languages. ( German, Spain and maybe French )
- Create promotions which are also applicable for people in the EU.
