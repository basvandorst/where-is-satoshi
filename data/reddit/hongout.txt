If it lets you sleep at night, it’s not overkill.

I'll address  since that's where human error comes into play which ironically, is the most threatening. 
Make sure you store your phrase on something that looks important. Something that doesn't look like it should end up in the garbage. A piece of paper you ripped out of a notebook or a sticky note will more likely be mistaken for trash.
Laminate it, use thick card stock, etc. Make copies incase one of them gets damaged. Put it in a safe or hide it. 
If you want to take a step further, you can etch it or stamp it in metal. If you're not "artsy [ or [ are tools that make storing in metal easier.

Seconded. This was a really good and fun experiment. Sure, overkill, but that’s the best kind of kill. Nothing gives you peace of mind like the worst than worst case scenario. These guys didn’t have any in stock at the time unfortunately.

It’s been awhile, but I believe there is an option at the end after shipping info.

I definitely agree that punches are much cheaper. There are also other options that are less expensive than this but more expensive than punches.
Like ice cream flavors, you can pick now.
I had fun with this though. My personal opinion, it was easier than hammering stamps.

To put it simply, the seed is ultimately the thing to keep safe if nothing else. Since that itself can restore your wallet and generate your private key in event your hardware wallet goes to shit, which it will as all electronics will eventually.
Your hardware wallet has a pin and it's more for convenience sake to make transactions. (sort of like having your banking app on your phone)
So to echo everyone else. Keep your hardware wallet secure but accessible. 
Keep your seed hidden, stored, and difficult to access. 
Some things people recommend to keep the seed safe are:
* Getting metal stamps of amazon and stamping it on steel/titanium or getting something like a cryptosteel/blockplate
* Storing it in a fireproof safe (First Alert, SentrySafe)
* If on paper, laminating it
* Making multiple copies or writing half the seed phrase on one piece of paper, writing half the seed phrase on another
Do one, or all. Whatever lets you sleep at night. But otherwise your pretty secure.

Also a good idea to split it into two (12 + 12). That way if anyone ever gets a hold of one half of it, they would be none the wiser a second half exists (since 12 word seeds are a plausible thing)

No need, one trezor, one account, one 24 word seed. To clarify I meant writing words 1-12 down on something and words 13-24 on a something else.  That way if someone got a hold of one part of it, they wouldn't know another 12 words exist since 12 word seeds are possible. (That is you don't number them 13-24)

Also with whatever you decide to write your seed on to give to your wife, make sure it looks important.
Too many times someone throws away a seemingly unimportant piece of paper when really, it's your seed. 
Laminate it, write it on nice card stock, store it on metal, whatever. Make sure it doesn't look like it should go in the trash.

I'd keep your ledgers somewhat accessible since its purpose is convenience for transactions.
In terms of your seed, storing on metal is a good fire/water proof option or multiple paper laminated copies in fireproof safes.

I think splitting your recovery seed (12 + 12) should become common practice. If one were to find 12 words, they would have no idea another 12 words exist (since 12 word seeds are plausible). That is, you don't number them 13-24.

From the website, it says there is a backside to it. So 6 words on the back. 
For the 4 letters, quoting from the website:
Your 12-24 recovery seed phrase most likely comes from the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal: 39 (BIP 39). BIP 39 is the use of a mnemonic phrase -- a group of easy to remember words -- to serve as your back up recovery in the event your wallet becomes compromised.
These words are pulled from a specific list of 2048 words.  In this list, the first 4 letters are unique to each word. This means if you have the first 4 letters, you know the rest of the word. Some wallets will even fill in the rest of the word once the first 4 letters are entered.

A common question that is still frequently asked a ton!
Quickly googling:


 These words are pulled from a specific list of 2048 words.  In this list, the first 4 letters are unique to each word.
In other words, there are no two words in this list with the same first 4 letters.

~~To my knowledge, I believe this only applies to the **english** word list.~~
