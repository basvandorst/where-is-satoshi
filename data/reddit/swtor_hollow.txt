You can also install core on a desktop computer. Then let it sync the block chain and then transfer it over to your rpi hard drive. That’s what I did for my rpi full node and it was up and running much quicker. Had it done within a day.

I thought trading between cryptos was now or will be soon a taxable event in the US. Am I misinformed?

Apparently not

On gdax? My bank transfers always seem to take 5-7 days. I wish I could buy instantly.

So I messaged them asking why I was denied and they responded with something along the lines of, "we don't tell people why they are denied."
I can't think of anything that would get me denied. I have good credit, great credit, clear background, solid job I've been at for nearly 17 years etc etc. I'm so disappointed, because I was really looking forward to using a service like bitwage.

How long did you wait for a response from them? I have also emailed them back with some questions, but have yet to hear back.

I would say my employer's credit is probably considered one of the most reliable in that department. I have sent out a reply to the above email asking what information led to my denial, but have not heard back. What sucks is that I was REALLY looking forward to using their service.

I really appreciate the response and the links. I read both of them. But they don't really answer my questions that I posed above. Which of the available options supports the original vision, while also decreasing fees and containing the principle of decentralization? And also eliminating exploits and increasing block size?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:33:02
I'll take a look around again. It's all very confusing to a new person for sure. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:58:47
So couple questions then:
1) What are the pros/cons of increasing the block size and why is it such a point of contention?
2) With all the talk or hard forks/soft forks and other changes, is there any danger to already purchased coins that I have in a hardware wallet like a keepkey or a phone wallet like breadwallet?

I still can't wrap my head around all this. I've read a lot over the past few days and everything is so emotionally charged and filled with opinions fueled by hatred of one person/group or another it makes it hard to see what is actually on the table. 
What option follows the original vision of satoshi? Which option increases the decentralized principle and has fees decreasing back to more reasonable levels? Which option stops rewarding mining pool groups from using an exploit to increase their own profits? That's the one I would like to follow but I have no idea what that is or how to support it. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:22:42
I know man. I want to support what I described in my initial post: original vision, bigger block size, lower fees, decentralized control. I just don't know which of the options that is. So much political drama.
