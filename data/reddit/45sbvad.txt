There is obviously a lot of noise that people are fooled by; but patterns do exist.
If I recall correctly Nassim Nicholas Taleb of "Black Swan" and "Fooled by Randomness" made his fortune by using and developing models of derivative pricing. Certainly much more involved than looking at a chart, but the idea that you can financially model some things does indicate that there are patterns that can be gamed.

Social engineering or an inside job makes the most sense.
Bitfinex's key to their 2 of 3 multisig wallet was compromised and BitGo just auto-authorized withdrawals, essentially turning multisig into a single sig wallet.
So somebody got Bitfinex's key, most likely through social engineering, or somebody who already had access to the key.
It would be truly amateur if it turns out the key was actually hacked due to a faulty random number generator.

And what happens when a privileged insider leaks their access to the permissioned blockchain either through greed or social engineering?
A permissioned blockchain is just fancy talk for security through obscurity. A few people are given priveledged access that is maintained by secret keys. Those keys get leaked and the whole system crumbles.
Imagine if Bitcoin were like this, then things like Bitfinex having their private key compromised would affect every Bitcoin user, not just those at finex.
A permissioned blockchain is quite possibly the most insecure and risky solution to interbank settlement.

I think a lot of people have invested in Bitcoin not because we want the world to crash and burn, but because we have seen the writing on the wall; that the legacy financial system will crash and burn and that the longer the can kicks down the road, the worse it will be for everyone.
The sooner the legacy system crumbles, the less tragic it will be for everyone. Under the assumption that it will crumble, it is best that it crumbles sooner rather than later. It will be quite possibly the most tragic event in recorded human history or the catalyst of it. It just gets more tragic as time goes on.
Its like a giant ponzi scheme. Sure when the scheme goes bust everyone involved suffers. The solution is not to do everything in your power to keep the ponzi going, sucking in more losers, making more and more people vulnerable. In an ideal world a Ponzi scheme would go on forever and nobody would lose. In reality, it will fail, and everyone involved will suffer.
Well not everyone, the lowest on the totem pole will suffer the most. Everyone important will have found a greater fool to pass off their toxic instruments before hand.

1.5-2% is really not bad, at least in my opinion. I've used Bitcoin Vending Machines that charged a 5% fee ontop of a "Spot Price" that was already 5% higher than everywhere else.

Very basic objects. A simple cube with 3-4 words embedded per face (excluding top and bottom). 
The cube with the seed words is then placed inside a hollow object being 3D printed. In order to retrieve the seed the hollow object must be broken. In this way you can transport your seeds inside 3D printed statues or other works of art.

It is certainly possible. There are several scenarios which could lead to that.
I believe that the fundamental economics of Bitcoin means that if it continues to exist 10 years from now the price will be significantly higher. Will it be 1M USD? and if so how much gold will 1M USD buy then? We should start measuring Bitcoin against other finite assets.

Real Estate Purchase for 750k asking 1M in BTC (lets say 100BTC) = $250k gain
BTC doubles in value and you have 2M in BTC. Need to pay taxes on 250k gain (lets say 30%) + 30% taxes on the gain in BTC.
75k/20k (20k/BTC) = 3.75BTC/0.85 (for taxes) = 4.41 BTC
So you only need to cash out less than 5 BTC to pay the gains on the house and the gains from the BTC.
That leaves you with ~95 BTC; at $20k that's 1.9Million

1) Blocks are the container that transactions are sealed into. Transactions are verified by nodes. The hash of the next block does include a hash of every previous block before it hashed together.
2) The miner that randomly creates the hash that fits the parameters required of the next block is rewarded the 25Bitcoin (soon to be 12.5Bitcoin). The parameters for the next block are automatically made more difficult as miners upgrade their hardware to produce more hashes per second. This is done by averaging the timestamps between blocks and increasing the number of leading zero's required for finding blocks every 2016 blocks (approximately 2 weeks) such that with the number of random hashes received by the network per second will chance upon a block every 10 minutes on average.
3) Confirmations: When a transaction is submitted to the network it usually propagates more or less instantaneously. However it is not considered a confirmed transaction until it is confirmed in a block. Each subsequent block that includes that transaction history increases the confirmation count by 1. Most people consider a transaction pretty much immutable after 6 blocks. The reason confirmations are important is for several reasons. First it is possible to attempt a double spend transaction by sending the same coins to multiple addresses at the same time. Until the coins are confirmed in a block all of these transactions will propagate through the network. Once a miner includes transactions in a block, it can only choose one transaction, usually the one with the highest fee/byte ratio. For this reason a single confirmation is usual critical when transacting with unknown or untrusted parties. Additionally, the block chain can temporarily split or fork creating a parrellel universe where in one fork a transaction A to B is included in a block and on the other fork transaction A to C is included in a block. These forks are quite rare and usually resolve themselves within 6 blocks or less. For this reason the number of confirmations should depend on the size of the transaction and relative trust between transacting parties.
4) I'm sure others have a better idea than myself on this one, but if encryption breaks down fundamentally, a lot of the systems we use to secure personal information will be open to the world. Criminals, governments, your neighbors, could easily steal your identity, use personal information to harass and coerce you. The possibility of any kind of electronic transaction will come into question. Ecommerce would crumble. National secrets coming public causing global instability. 
5) Several orders of magnitude more than Bitcoin

It is possible that BCI has given two people the same seed. The person with 3+ BTC made a transaction and the ~3BTC were returned to a change address. This address probably shows up in both of their wallets and if that is the case then the other addresses are compromised as well.
So at the very least they should make a new wallet with a random seed and transfer the funds that are theirs to the new wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:17:21
Is this really possible? 
I'd say no. There has to be a database to match the brainscan, with either a hash or the actual key itself.
Like a fingerprint; taking in real world data has noise. When you hash real world data with a little bit of noise the hash is completely different from the hash of the same data without the noise. 
So for fingerprint scanning they must store some kind of map of your fingerprint pattern and allow some kind of tolerance between the scanned print and the print on record. They couldn't store a hash since the recorded data must match exactly to reproduce the same hash, which is not realistic. So fingerprint scanners rely on a database of fingerprints, which could be hacked or stolen at somepoint.
This is the same case here. The brain scan database cannot simply hold a hash of your brain scan but some parameters which have tolerances. If your mental patterns changed slightly the hash of your brain scan would be completely different. This means that your brain scan itself would have to be stored, which represents a single point of failure beyond your control.
Seems like a downright terrible idea to me, anyone want to elaborate why it would be a good idea?

You think any centralized service is going to allow you to send international payments without complying with banking regulations?
Just because companies are releasing coins doesn't make them exempt from financial regulations. That is the entire point of decentralized money; there is nobody to fine, jail, or assassinate. 
Centralized coins will have to comply with financial regulations just like banks.
This was tried many times in the 80's , 90's , and early 2000's. Each time a company tries to offer an alternative form of transactional currency it is forced to either comply with banking regulations or be shut down and/or jailed.
People "investing" into these centralized coins are completely unaware that this has been tried many times in the past; and it is always stomped down within a couple of years after they gain popularity. Look into the Liberty Dollar or eGold. 
All centralized coins will be forced to comply with regulations; or their creators will be jailed. Why do you think Satoshi is anonymous?
Why do you think PayPal doesn't just release PayPal coin and use their current infrastructure and network to launch a coin that is used on their backend? They would get crushed by regulations.

To be completely fair in order for the price to remain stable (since miners do have bills) there is downward pressure of 3600 coins per day which comes out to $1.5million USD downward pressure in addition to the regular supply and demand.
So while supply itself will almost always be growing (until we start losing more than are mined), the downward pressure on the price will be relieved to the tune of $750k/day. 
Prices certainly can be manipulated, and there are no real constants in economics. But if we assume that $1.5million new USD is invested into BTC per day (which I know is a poor assumption) and only $750k worth of new Bitcoins are created each day, then supposedly that extra $750k/day would go into increasing the price until it reaches a new equilibrium.
Obviously many have already tried to price this in.
My personal prediction is that we will see prices climb until the halving, and then a 10-25% drop in the weeks after, followed by a stabilizing period of several weeks, and within 6 months or so after the halving we will really start to see the effect of reduced new supply on the market.

Bitcoin is different from fiat and takes some time to get used to.
I would buy small amounts at first and play around with it until you are comfortable sending, recieving, storing (in various methods) and being able to retrieve your stored BTC. Once you are comfortable using it just buy however much you think makes sense for your situation. Historically it has been better for most people to buy a small amount every day/week/month rather than buying all in one lump sum.

The fee has nothing to do with the value of Bitcoin transacted.
The fee is calculated based off the size in bytes that the transaction requires. Sending 1000 BTC can cost the same as sending 0.001 BTC depending on the number of "inputs"
In the mid term we should expect on chain fee's to decrease as SegWit is adopted and LN deployed. In the long term On Chain fee's will only increase; but I expect that fee's will decrease over the next 18months. After that point most people will transact entirely on the LN which will be nearly free and the main chain will be used for large consolidations between nodes and large transactions like real-estate.

2) Somebody who purposefully destroyed all their keys (unlikely)
3) Somebody/Group who is already much more wealthy than 1Million BTC

Cryptocurrencies are a new kind of asset class; and as such there is an enormous amount of misunderstanding.
This is a subject matter that many of us have been spending the better part of the past decade learning, developing, and coming to an understanding.
First and foremost; Altcoins only have any value because Bitcoin has a proven security model and unbeatable track record.
Bitcoin has been around for nearly a decade; and the network has proven to behave incredibly reliably. Funds can only be lost due to user error; not from unreliable software.
Bitcoin has survived and shrugged off every single attack without any loss of funds; over a period of 9 years. 
Bitcoin shrugs off these attacks because it is decentralized with no one in control. There is nobody that could be jailed or assassinated which would shut Bitcoin down. There is no single company or even group of companies that could actually damage the Bitcoin network through legal actions against them (the price would fall; but the network would remain undamaged).
Bitcoin has the most economic activity run through its blockchain and by far the most value stored in its tokens. 
Bitcoin is the lightning rod which attracts the attackers. If a flaw can be found in Bitcoin that causes loss of funds or otherwise destroy confidence in Bitcoin; then people will lose confidence in the entire Crypto-economy.
Put another way:
Altcoins only seem similar to Bitcoin because they aren't worth enough to bother attacking. Many Altcoins have crashed and burned and this does nothing to hurt Bitcoin. But if you can attack Bitcoin successfully it hurts all coins.
Thus far there is no Altcoin that comes anywhere close to Bitcoin in terms of decentralization. The top competitors on CoinMarketCap are all highly centralized and could be taken over / destroyed by Banks, Governments, or competing corporate interests.
Bitcoin is the only truly uncontrollable Coin. There literally is nothing that even comes close.
Decentralization isn't something that can be easily measured; but it can be observed. 
Ethereum: Jail Vitalik or Threaten him to lead ETH down a controllable direction - how healthy will this project remain without Vitalik or with him turned against it?
Ripple: Just buy out RippleLabs and enjoy 60Billion ripple premined supply
BCH: Buy out (or threaten) Ver and/or CSW to work against it.
I'm not saying that Altcoins have 0 value; but I am saying that without Bitcoin they have 0 value. If Bitcoin is not leader; then whoever is leader must prove to be truly uncontrollable; and thus far I know of no coin which holds a candle to Bitcoin.

It depends on the size your transaction takes up; which depends on the number of inputs and transaction type.
For instance if you send 0.01 BTC to an HD wallet once a week for 10 weeks; you'll have 0.1 BTC; but 10 different addresses that will require signatures from in order to move funds. Those signatures take up a lot of memory space and is essentially 10 transactions in 1; so it costs nearly 10x as much. But the fee would be the same if you collected 100 BTC in 10BTC weekly chunks or 0.1 BTC in 0.01 BTC chunks.
If you use SegWit; the signatures don't cost nearly as much since there has been extra space made for them. 
But in the end the cost of transaction is completely independent upon the value of the transaction. It all boils down to how many bytes the transaction takes up in the blockchain.

Bitcoin continues Bitcoining.
The network continues finding blocks and processing transactions within consensus rules. 
Bitcoin is a grass roots pysop campaign to question the value and role of fiat money. This is a slow process about changing peoples belief of what value is over time.
When Bitcoin first hit $100 it was considered an unsustainable bubble. But when it hit ~$100 after falling from $1000 most people saw this crash to be the end of Bitcoin. Strange how perspective matters so much. 
Last year many believed the top was at $1000 ; then $5000 ; then $9000 ; then $20,000. Maybe we've hit the top of this cycle; maybe we haven't.
But what matters is that global perception changes slowly. If Bitcoin falls down to $5k and holds that for 2+ years; people will accept that Bitcoin is worth thousands. 
I believe that the Bitcoin network and token have significant potential to change the world. We haven't even begun to see Bitcoin being utilized for its unique properties at scale yet. 
In the short term; anything could happen; but in the long run if Bitcoin is still here 10 years from now; it will change the world for the better and will be worth hundreds of thousands or millions.

Not enough to affect your lifestyle or other financial goals.
On the other hand; if you truly won't need that money for ~4 years ; there is no issue investing large amounts all at once; but be prepared for significant short-term paper losses. Not that I believe Bitcoin will continue going down; but it certainly could , at least in the short term.

I can sell 0.5BTC right now and be guaranteed to turn that into 1.0BTC on Feb14th; that sounds like a good deal to me. 
If I'm wrong about price I lose the difference between $5k and the market price ; but I still gain considering that I wouldn't normally sell at all; but if I sell coins now; you are garuanteeing 2x the number of coins in Feb. So when considering those 2 choices (holding or entering this agreement) the outcomes could be:
1) If price crashes below $5k (say $1k)
If I sell 0.5 BTC now it will turn into 1.0BTC valued at $1k for a total paper loss of $4000 ($5000-$1000); but considering I would have just kept the 0.5BTC my loss is less than just holding ($4500 loss holding vs $4000 loss entering this contract) 
My losses would be limited to $5000 ; and are mitigated somewhat by increasing BTC holdings regardless.
2) Price Moons to $50k
If I sell 0.5BTC now it will turn into 1.0 BTC valued at $50k for a paper gain of $45,000 ; and a loss of $45,000 for you. Your losses would be unlimited unless you're already holding Bitcoin. But why would you be holding BTC if you believe the price is going to halve soon?

Venezuela has been undergoing inflation at far greater than 1-3% per year for many years; if you want to define hyperinflation at 50% per month; well that is certainly hyperinflation ; but so is 10%.
Fiat money and inflationary money IS the same thing. Without a hard asset to "Back" currency ; it has no backing; just political promises.
Please explain why 1-3% is magical; but 50% per month is too much? So you don't like having your wealth stolen from you because its too much in your opinion; but you don't mind advocating to steal from others if its only 1-3% per year? Hypocrite. Why not 0.1% why not 1.5636%? Why not 10%?

The scenario you describe is precisely why I am involved in Bitcoin.
This world is in trouble. Major economies are only kept afloat because poor people feel they need to spend their money today, even if it is on something non-essential, because its value will slip away over time.
The rich have always had access to deflationary or non-inflationary stores of value; and that is what they keep their assets in until they decide they really want to spend it.
Earth has finite physical resources; infinite inflation that is not equally distributed causes unsustainable industries to be profitable for long periods of time. 
There is a massive economic collapse on the horizon because of these backwards Keynesians who think its in our best interest to steal our savings through inflation and hand it over to their buddies. 
Deflationary spiral is a good thing in the long run; and if we want Humanity to have a chance to get to year 3000 or explore intergalactic space; we need a deflationary spiral caused by real money tied to real resources.
What resource is Bitcoin tied to? Electricity. Eventually miner chips will only increase a few percent in efficiency per year. At that point access to electricity will really be all that limits mining. Bitcoin will be stably measurable in KWH.

Bigger blocks = less efficient transactions. The blocks just get filled up with junk data until the costs start rising to force people to be efficient.
Fee's are necessary to incentivize efficient use of a valuable resource (blockchain space). Increasing the blockspace doesn't increase the number of transactions; it decreases the value of the blockspace. That is what months of data is now showing.

Bitcoin is backed by the energy needed to mine it. In general the energy cost to mine a Bitcoin is about the market rate. Obviously during insane bull runs it becomes profitable to mine for a while; but the value of a Bitcoin is the amount of energy we divert to it instead of other uses. A Bitcoin can be thought of as to cost a certain number of kilowatt hours. 
However ultimately, like all commodities, including Gold, Silver, and Dollars; it is backed by our collective belief in their value.
I really don't believe fiat applies to Bitcoin just because its price (value) is determined by our collective belief in its value.
Fiat is government issued currency ; there is no fiat currency that isn't government issued. 
Bitcoin doesn't have value by decree; it has value because people freely choose to value it.

Inflation is a great way to turn a first world country into a place like Venezuela.
Japan has been undergoing mild deflation since the 90's ; Venezuela's inflation has only been out of control for a few years and its created an enormous humanitarian crisis.
Runaway inflation is the end game for all inflationary debt based fiat currencies. I somehow doubt that Venezeulan economists were trying to create runaway inflation. Like all economies bolstered by inflationary money; when it came to financial crisis they can choose to either to continue inflating the currency leading to hyperinflation; or they can choose to say "sorry government is bankrupt" and just give up. I can't think of a single example where a government or bank willingly gave up its power to inflate for the good of the people; instead they always inflate. When push comes to shove fiat currencies will choose to inflate rather than die; and this inevitably leads to hyperinflation when you have debt-based fiat.

Bitcoin could do anything. I wouldn't be shocked to wake up and see $4k ; and I wouldn't be shocked to wake up and see $20k.
There is no reason that $17k is too fast; and no reason we can't revisit $4k or less. 
If institutional money genuinely is looking for exposure to Bitcoin; then 17K is still very low.
If institutional money just wants to short the hell out of Bitcoin; then $17k is obviously way too high.
Overall I think the futures markets will stabilize the price by allowing shorts and longs to really duke it out on a larger scale. It will likely cause Bitcoin to go through long periods of stability; followed by very short (but violent) periods of volatility. This will increase its usefulness as a day to day currency.

Only non-essential goods and services will stop getting produced.
People aren't going to forgo food and other essential goods just because their money gets more valuable over time. They might decide not to spend on wasteful crap that is destroying both Humanity and the Environment we depend upon. But they will spend it on food, shelter, transportation; even if its value is going up everyday.
And the truth is; once Bitcoin reaches ~$1Million USD/Coin (in 2014 USD) ; even though it will be "deflationary" its value will not appreciate at nearly the same % rate as it has since 2009. Once we reach global saturation; Bitcoins value will rise in lock step with the global economic output.

Most of the coins will end up getting locked up in payment channels ; making these megacorps and other processors lots of money in transaction fee's. 
These 2nd and 3rd layers will actually be able to provide refunds/chargebacks if one of the transacting parties does not uphold their end of the deal. Though you'll probably pay extra fee's for payment channels that offer this protection service.
For those who want convenience L2+ will be as convenient and offer most services current CC processors offer. For those who need uncensorable transactions L1 will be available. You'll have the freedom to choose if you need the trustlessness of a blockchain confirmed transaction or if an inexpensive and convenient payment channel makes more sense.
Since the vast majority of the transactions will inevitably shift to L2+; this should help reduce fee's on the blockchain itself.

Bitmain could do a massive doublespend and then destroy the network.
They've got 1Million BCH ; they could unload them over the course of a few weeks in exchange for Bitcoin. Then once the exchanges allow them to withdraw (I'm sure there will be several hundred if not thousand confirmations required for such large amounts); they can launch a secret 51% attack. Remine thousands of blocks and reset the blockchain to a point before they sent their BCH to exchanges.
This would destroy BCH once and for all. The risk is that killing BCH could harm BTC price, at least in the short term; and that wouldn't be good for an organization that just bought a bunch of BTC.
Hard to say what will happen exactly; but I think its safe to say that once hashrate on BCH drops low enough; it will be attacked. Probably needs to be less than 5% ; I'd think it will be attacked before it gets as low as 1%.

Convenience and security are at odds with each other.
An exchange that holds customer funds should balance in favor of security over convenience.
Even so; offline signing is not difficult at all.
Transactions are crafted on a multi-sig watch only wallet.
Transaction is transferred via SD or USB (formatted to ~100Kb to prevent unwanted data) to airgapped signing device.
Transaction is signed by co-signer 1.
Then transaction is re-saved to USB; then this partially signed transaction can then be transmitted online to a 2nd co-signer in a offsite location. Loaded on secure USB or SD and then signed on another airgapped device.
Rinse and repeat for as many cosigners are necessary. Once the final signature is added it can be broadcast to the network through any wallet or node.
To make things easier it makes sense to have several wallets of varying security and convenience. 
A minimum security; very convenient hot wallet. The hot wallet can be topped up at regular intervals from the airgapped wallet. And for added security there should be multiple multi-signature airgapped wallets. This is also a pretty sane solution for holders as well. No need to hold 100% of your funds in a single address or even a single seed. No need to have 100% of your funds easily accessible and easily compromised.
Once your bitcoin is gone; it is gone forever; no take backsies.

It has become clear that there are no good arguments against BIP101. If there were great arguments against it, those arguments would be trotted out everytime BIP101 is brought up. 
Because there are absolutely no good arguments against BIP101, discussion of it has been censored. So instead of discussing the merits of different proposals, we are discussing censorship.
It is a tried and true tactic when one camp has absolutely no legs to stand on.
If there were any good arguments against BIP101 the weight of the arguments would be enough to settle the debate.
You can rest assured that all the positive arguments for BIP101 are censored and all that you will see in this subreddit and many forums controlled by a small cabal, are pseudo arguments against BIP101 that mostly amount to having fear instilled by authority.
Blatant censorship in this subreddit is pathetic intellectual dishonesty and demonstrates complete lack of logical or rational argument.
If you were on the fence about BIP101, it should be clear now that despite censorship across many important channels, BIP101 has proven its merits. Despite a clear, concerted, campaign against BIP101 there remains no effective argument against it and those against it must resort to censorship and DDOS tactics.
If one side of an argument doesn't even have an argument that they feel can withstand the light of day, and then furthermore must censor and attack those who bring forth an opposing argument, it seems that side is completely intellectually bankrupt.

They kind of bootstrap each other.
The effect of increasing your hashrate is (all else equal) to increase your share of mined bitcoins. So increased demand for hashrate is increased demand for bitcoins.
Certainly miners upon profiting from price increase will use some of that profit to increase their hashrate. At the end of the day they desire profit, and bitcoin is the vehicle to that profit.
But we also see when the price increases, new miners joining the ranks. During certain periods of time when the price increases and new hardware is released it can be profitable for smart, shrewd individuals to join the mining race.

Most people that I've talked to who believe the banks are about to collapse believe so for many reasons, many going back to specific regulations in the early 00's. Maybe some have claimed bitcoin will cause a banking collapse, but I think most who are hopeful for bitcoin see it as a replacement when the banks collapse on their own. Certainly many bitcoins want the banks to collapse, but I don't think many believe it will be the cause of the collapse.

Good refutation. Mind sharing what I "just don't get"?
A private blockchain may have its uses, but it doesn't do anything to address the issues that bitcoin was created to address.
A private, privileged blockchain is inherently less worthy of being trusted than a public, permission-less ledger.
A ledger that can be changed by privileged entities does not address the issues that a permission-less ledger addresses.
A currency that can be inflated by privileged entities does not address the issues that a finite currency inflated on an predetermined mathematical schedule, enforced by everyone participating in the network.
Private blockchains have their uses, just as Intranet has its uses. But to think private blockchains are even comparable to the public ledger in its revolutionary potential is misguided.

The biggest value proposition in Crypto is wealth outside/despite authority, AKA permissionless wealth combined with the public blockchain.
The blockchain is an unbiased external record keeping system. Banks will be forced to publish their "private" block hashes into the bitcoin Blockchain if they want any of the revolutionary benefits crypto offers.
When your money is already in Crypto (BitFiat) why would you keep it in an infinitely inflating Crypto that is constantly losing value to a finite Crypto?
Bitfiat will make the fiat ponzi scheme obvious. Inflation benefits those at the printing press, obviously. And the printing press only retains value if demand for currency inflates at the same rate. Demand for currency mostly results through debt, aka desire for freedom from bondage. So in order to stabilize inflationary currencies, bondage/debt must continually increase.
In order to maintain inflationary currencies, we must enslave ourselves to those who have power over the printing press.
Bitfiat will make the transition to Bitfreedom easy and obvious.

That is about the core of the argument against BIP101. "It will cause centralization" "It's obvious, it doesn't need to be proven"
Seriously have you heard of a .... soft fork?
BIP101 prepares for the future, and if that future doesn't come soft limits can be set in place and/or the network can be soft-forked.
So quite obviously it is a logical inference that if there ever were a problem with the blocksize schedule causing centralization there would be a soft-fork (much easier to deal with) to handle the issue.
I can't believe we have gotten to the point where the small blockists arguments amounts to "Its obvious" "I don't have to prove it"
What is obvious and logical is that BIP101 is forward thinking and there are plenty of opportunities to stall the scheduled blocksize increases with soft forks. 
What is obvious and logical is that you cannot predict the future. You are predicting that BIP101's blocksize increase schedule will outpace growth in network bandwidth and disk capacity. That is only one of many scenarios. We could easily see breakthroughs in computing that outpace the growth schedule in BIP101, we could also see technology keep pace right with BIP101, or technology almost keep pace with BIP101. There are so many different scenarios that will affect the affordability of running a node. 
What is obvious is that you cannot predict that BIP101 will increase centralization simply because in the future it will increase computing resource requirements.
Why isn't it obvious and logical that the network would soft-fork to adapt to future threats of centralization?

Sure when you frame the narrative like that I suppose I'd rather trust US banks over Chinese banks. But that isn't remotely the situation.
Remember when Ghash.io approached 50% of the hashrate and began announcing that they would willing attempt to gain greater than 50% of the hashrate? The actual miners decided this wasn't acceptable and pointed their machines at other pools. Ghash is tiny now in response to its irresponsible business decisions. That is decentralization in action.


The fee's in bitcoin are still much smaller than CC processing, and bitcoin transactions have the benefit of settling ownership of an asset whereas a CC transaction does nothing of the sort. Settlement in bitcoin takes 10 minutes, your bank doesn't settle your CC transactions every 10 minutes. Bitcoin transactions are more comparable to bank settlements than CC transactions, and 3rd party networks, additional layers, on top of the bitcoin settlement layer will be more comparable to CC transactions.


But the difference is that the US dollar is designed to lose 2% per year. It is openly declared. Whereas Bitcoin is designed to reign in on inflation. It doesn't mean that every year bitcoin is destined to outperform fiat, but if bitcoin has any value in the future its trajectory in the long term is only up. This doesn't mean that bitcoin is destined to succeed, just that, if it retains value in the future, it is much more likely to vastly increase than to decrease to a non-zero number.


You are misunderstanding or obfuscating the difference between a privileged ledger and a permission-less ledger. On a privileged ledger, only authorized entities can participate in the act of mining/making an addition to the blockchain.
On a permission less ledger anyone, anywhere can participate in making an addition to the blockchain. You can even manually enter hashes and hope to get lucky! 
And again, a single mining pool often represents many, many miners. In the past, miners have demonstrated their ability to decentralize from pools that get too large. It seems the trend continues.

Seems only fair. Humans have been slaves to money for long enough, its time for money to be our slaves. 
Though if the money itself is performing its own transactions then who can be said to control the keys? 
An interesting phenomenon where money AI has a diverse circumstantial set of rules depending on the address it occupies. A general profit seeking AI combined with the local needs of the private key owner. Money that trades itself for securities while budgeting the appropriate amount for food, bills, and personal tastes. 
Would this AI have the ability to buy stronger AI to upgrade itself? Why not.
I do believe that the hyperbitcoinization event if it happens, will be the kickstarter for the technological singularity.
As the value of bitcoin rises people will spend on upgraded technology. Mines will grow, trading platforms will enhance and mature, individuals will seek out ways to maintain their newfound wealth.
At a certain point a major re-organization of humanity will occur. In order to maintain a high level of civilization with 7billion people our maintainence of planet Earth will have to change. Will the AI simply fund the right projects in the right places that cause this shift to happen naturally. Guiding humanity.

Why would the owners of all the advanced robotics suddenly start sharing the wealth with everyone else? 
If there isn't some kind of mass consciousness shift, we should expect to see society behave similarly as it does today. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The rich might use the robots to keep the breedstock nourished enough to perform tasks the robots are not yet capable of. However I fully expect massive starvation and suffering of billions of people. A small peak civilization of several hundred million people survive into the year 2050.
I just don't think human biology is capable of making the consciousness leap to create this world of abundance. It has always been possible to create a utopia with our own labor. So why would robots make things different. We can already use machines, technology, and new scientific understanding to create a Utopic world, but that is not happening, that is not where our civilization is oriented. Nor is our civilization oriented toward the stars. We seem to be stuck in some kind of kicking the can stasis. We all know it can't last forever but are always aghast to wake up and find the world has not ended.

Why not just insert the blockhash(es) of AltCoins into the Bitcoin blockchain?
When you can shift your coins around with shapeshift seamlessly you are "depositing" value into an Altcoin, and when you shift back you are depositing that value back into bitcoin.
What advantage do sidechains have over AltCoins?
As we get more services like ShapeShift won't the open Coin market represent the ultimate decentralized way to lock up value on another chain?

One of Bitcoins most revolutionary breakthroughs is value outside of authority.
Here is a completely abstract thing, essentially an idea. You cannot touch it, see it, smell it, eat it. No taxes are paid with it. Yet it has value.
No authority, government, or bank gives bitcoin value. It has a certain utility, but its main value proposition is the fact that it exists outside authority.
R3 cannot compete on these terms unless it creates something outside of its own control.
These blockchains might have higher throughput, but at the end of the day the public bitcoin blockchain will be the end all be all record keeping system. These private chains will all be writing block hashes to the bitcoin blockchain. 
They will use bitcoin to anchor their own chains and nothing more, and I think this is part of why there is so much resistance to increase blocksizes. Larger blocks will allow corporations to use bitcoins blockchain for free and then use their superior social position to advertise their private chains.
What would the exchange rate between an infinitely supplied "bitfiat" and finite "bitcoin". If all the bank dollars switched to bitfiat, this would only accelerate the flight to safety. With bitfiat losing every day to finite cryptos, what would prevent the flight from bitfiat to bitcoin? I mean now that all money is already digital blockchain tokens, why keep your tokens on a chain where they continually depreciate rather than appreciate?
You might move your bitcoin tokens into a bitfiat wallet for spending purposes, but thats all. The majority of money wouldn't be held in bitfiat just as it is not held in dollars.

Sock puppets cannot be neutralized. There is no way to determine the difference between a sock puppet and a legitimate user without exceptional access to information (IPs, MachineFingerprints, etc)
Unfortunately its best just to form your own opinions based on the facts you can establish, rather than consult the crowd. 
It is truly unfortunate because many people are swayed by the crowd, but there is simply no way to root out the astroturfing. 
It is really interesting to imagine a scenario where sockpuppets outnumber legitimate users 10:1 and all legitimate users have the entire bounds of discussion set by the astroturfers. This will probably lead to propaganda wars where any opinion that wants to be represented at all needs an astroturfing campaign.

Decentralization. No other coin is nearly as decentralized as Bitcoin.
If Crypto ever becomes a threat to fiat currencies; governments will do what they can to destroy it; unless they cannot.
Most other coins are highly centralized. Either in community, development, or PoW. While Bitcoin is not quite as decentralized as many would like; it is far more decentralized than any other Crypto out there. 
Decentralization is what makes Bitcoin immutable; which is what makes Bitcoin digital gold.
This entire year Bitcoin underwent a civil war over a relatively minor rule change; to increase blocksize to 2Mb. The inability of Bitcoin to be changed in the face of major businesses, miners, and prominent community members proved that Bitcoin is not owned by anybody. 
If Bitcoin cannot get consensus to upgrade to 2Mb blocks; it will never get consensus to change the coin distribution schedule or other key parameters. Other coins can "upgrade" freely; but this also means that they are vulnerable. Prominent developers in other coins are able to single-handedly push through consensus breaking changes; which means if they were ever given an NSL it would be easy to destroy these other coins by directing the behavior of these prominent members.
Bitcoin is the most decentralized, most widely accepted, with the biggest infrastructure (both real world and online; by orders of magnitude). 
Nothing wrong with other coins; but at this point any other coin could be relatively easily destroyed/changed by outside forces; whereas Bitcoin has proven itself to be immutable to attack/changes.

To be fair I actually agree that BIP101 is too aggressive. I'm just sick that there isn't much good debate surrounding this issue and that the response is censorship rather than discussion. 
Though I don't believe that we can assume that BIP101 will increase the cost of running a node. It is likely, but we don't know for certain. Certainly it will always be more costly than 1mb blocks, but technology advancements could outpace BIP101's schedule and keep nodes just as cheap to run in the future as they are today. It is likely BIP101 will cause the cost of running a node to increase. However even this doesn't guarantee nodes will be more centralized in the future. If bitcoin becomes wildly more popular (and more valuable) more people will have more money (and incentive) to secure the network.
Personally I am more of a BIP102 person, I'd rather a basic layer of digital gold that is unable to be censored, with bells and whistles added by 3rd parties. I see and understand the utility of having widely distributed inexpensive nodes throughout the globe not just in server rooms, but peoples houses. 
The more resources that are required to maintain the bitcoin network, the more fragile it is to random shocks. The more complex the code becomes the more room for exploits. What we have is already digital gold, something the world has never seen before. Lets protect its status as digital gold and move forward slowly and carefully. 
Governments and banks have no intention of competing with digital gold. They will compete for transaction space, but they will never create a finite currency outside of their control, and that is what Bitcoin excels at.
These are the arguments I want to see trotted out against BIP101!

So you don't refute the information, you just don't believe the cited facts are related?
I think it is pretty clear that the facts are related in the narrative quite well. If a government was concerned about the safety of its people, its expenses on safety would be proportional (or somewhat proportional*) to the risks citizens face in society. 
Why do we tax payers pay money to keep sugars low cost and vegetables high cost? The government attempts to regulate food prices and it has undeniably resulted in an epidemics in obesity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease. The increased risk that americans face for these diseases is due to the regulation of food prices through subsidies. Sure we all have free will, but when the choice is giving your children enough calories or enough nutrition, the choice is harder to make.
Or maybe you don't believe its the governments job to protect us, but to simply follow the will of the people. CISA has been shot down by the people for half a decade and is now snuck in.
These examples demonstrate that our government neither cares about our safety or the will of the people. I believe that is how these facts are connected.
I highlighted this word because you needed an explanation for the company analogy. That analogy is directly relating the death statistics cited earlier. When human lives are lost unnecessarily, civilization loses. You can consider unnecessary human deaths a cost to civilization. These people had something to provide to civilization and their life was taken, so it costs humanity to raise another human to take their place. So this analogy compares the cost to humanity from losing lives unnecessarily to the costs a company might face. If your goal was to reduce all your costs to 0 (reduce all unnecessary deaths to 0) wouldn't you spend the most money on your biggest costs and the least money on the smallest costs? That is the meaning of the word proportional.

Individuals using their power of contribution to a decentralized network to make their opinion known is immature? This is exactly how bitcoin was designed to handle conflicts. This isn't about pro or anti-Gavin, this is very clearly about removing a proven attack vector (high fee spam) and fulfilling the expectations of most participants within the system (very few expected transaction rate to be forever bogged down to 3TPS).
Failing to increase the blocksize is potentially catastrophic as speculators move to other coins. If the price drops too low, miners drop out, blocks take even longer, more miners drop out, and then difficulty adjustment never happens.
A contentious hardfork could also cause this scenario to happen, I guess we will just have to see how much money is behind the proposals.

Bitcoin will start becoming simplified as the protocol matures. The underlying tech is still too exciting to develop for people to spend their time making beautiful and intuitive GUI's. 
Internet was very complicated to use for a long time. Even after it became "easy" to use the Internet (late 90's) most people still didn't go online. 
The Internet for better or worse went mainstream with social media, Facebook. 
In other words, everyone started using the Internet when they felt social pressure to. Social media creates a sense of social pressure online. 
Bitcoin will develop slick interfaces, addresses will be replaced by names or email when using certain services. But the masses will never adopt bitcoin unless they feel social pressure to adopt.
Nations have gone through currency collapses many times and yet the majority hold their savings in their nations fiat rather than assets.
The average person won't ever directly buy bitcoin. Their banks will though. The average person will keep dollar denominated accounts with banks that use Bitcoin to represent those dollars. The beauty is, when Bitcoin rises, the banks will profit enormously while the dollar denominated accounts wont grow.

Lightning network from my understanding will create a network of payment "Hubs" (Lightning Nodes). 
Hubs will use their Bitcoin holdings to provide liquidity. They will do this by opening many payment channels with other Hubs and merchants. Once the network is sufficiently matured; each Hub will be able to find a route to any other Hub/Endpoint (merchant/individual).
So you will open a channel with a Hub of your choice (or as many or few as you desire) and you will be able to route your transactions to essentially, anyone else on the Lightning network.
Lightning isn't the end all scaling solution; but will provide orders of magnitude more transactional throughput. Whether you can buy coffee or gas will be more dependent upon merchant adoption of Bitcoin/Lightning rather than the economics of paying miners fees.

I think you've been exposed to for too long.
I'll say it again, if there were any good arguments against BIP101, debate would not be censored. Censorship is an intellectually bankrupt way to debate an issue and demonsrates lack of rational argument.
If BIP101 discussion becomes uncensored, then perhaps I'll consider the small blockists more, but the fact that their argument has no legs to stand on other than censoring an opposing argument makes it pretty clear there is no rational argument against BIP101.
Censorship against BIP101 is proof enough that there is no argument against it.
Answer this, If there were good arguments against BIP101, why is it censored? Other BIPs have been debated in the past, but this BIP must be censored for our own good? Do you really believe that is an argument?
If the small blockists want to be taken seriously debate needs to occur uncensored. Right now their inability to discredit BIP101 by any means other than censorship indicates there is no rational argument to stand on other than censorship.
The best argument for BIP101 is that the only argument against it is silence.

I doubt people would be turned off crypto even if we fail to hardfork.
If Bitcoin is kept at 1Mb and transactions on chain become prohibitively expensive for everyday purchases there will be a Crypto Unification of the strongest chains touting their various properties. We may see a scenario where Bitcoin becomes digital gold and onchain transactions cost tens to hundreds of dollars. In that case the overflow will flow to other chains. The masses will be fine with off-chain solutions, but there is enough demand for inexpensive on-chain transactions to secure other blockchains if needed.
The strongest crypto's will unite in certain ways. Integrated wallets that hold multiple cryptos, all summed and denominated as a single currency (USD,EUR, BTC) and the smart wallet will analyze routes and determine which blockchain and conversion chain matrix will be the least expensive at the current time.
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:36:29
It is not that AltCoins are needed, I am simply stating what will happen if on-chain bitcoin transactions become prohibitively expensive. People will move to altcoins.
If sidechains eliminate the transaction pressure before it really builds up then there will be no need to move to altcoins. 
Sidechains and Lightning network will be great once they are ready, but if they are not ready by the time transaction fee's start rising significantly, many enthusiasts and speculators will move to other coins. 
Bitcoins growth potential will be limited when transactions become costly and then speculators will begin re-assesing their speculations.
This Bitcoin fork must be the last one. If we continually fork bitcoin people will lose confidence in its ability to resist the problems of central banking. However if Bitcoin does not scale people will lose confidence in Bitcoin's ability to transform finance. The people will not lose confidence in Crypto's ability to transform the world however.

Peer to peer means going from one entity to another directly without a 3rd party in between. Peers are equal participants on the network. When you use Paypal; Paypal is entirely in control. You are not a peer on the Paypal network handing over funds to another peer on the network. Paypal controls this entirely. 
The only peer to peer fiat exchange that doesn't require any kind of intermediary is a cash transaction. 
I'm sorry but you need to educate yourself in this field a bit more. You need to understand the definitions of these commonly accepted terms. It sounds like in actuality Peer to Peer transactions do not matter to you at all. All that matters to you is that ownership is legally transferred from one party to another.

If Bitcoin becomes the global standard of savings/stored wealth it will absolutely reduce spending and economic "growth" ; and that is a good thing.
Economic growth is not the end all be all of human happiness and prosperity. 
A slave can be forced to work hard labor up to 18 hours a day ; whereas a freeman is often productive for less than 8 hours. If we organize labor such that 90% of the population is enslaved the other 10% would certainly enjoy the greatest economic growth imaginable.
Moving from a debt-based to a capital-based currency/society would likely be accompanied by reduced economic growth; as people would spend less on unnecessary consumption and opt for future gains. This would highlight all the useless endeavors that people work their lives away for. Many unnecessary jobs will vanish. 
Not to be mean, but I don't care what "most people" care about. Most people live paycheck to paycheck their entire lives and never have an opportunity to ponder issues such as inflation. Most people don't understand the forces they are subject to so of course they don't care.

Yes reduced spending and a reduction in jobs would follow. 
Better is entirely subjective because what is "good" or "right" is entirely subjective. Anyone who understands the consequences and how they align with their beliefs are perfectly qualified to say what is "better"
So yes the end result a deflationary currency would have on society would certainly be "better" in my opinion.
I also highly question your assumption that "If financial experts knew it was better, that's what governments would be doing." ; in fact I believe assumption this to be dangerously naive. "Better" is subjective and it is naive to believe that governments will do what is in the best interests of those they govern. From both a historical and modern standpoint it would be far more rational to assume that governments will do what is in the best interests of themselves and their acquaintances. Sometimes that aligns with the interests of the governed; often it does not.
Yes; what other people care about impacts me; but their beliefs in no way impact my beliefs or understanding. I'm not interested in "pitching" Bitcoin to anyone who doesn't care in decentralization or deflationary currency/assets. In fact I hope those people who don't care about these properties stay away from Bitcoin for as long as possible.
Bitcoins revolutionary breakthrough is not about "instant transactions" or free payments. We already have that with fiat. Paying by credit card is a superior user experience and will be for some time. People are not converting to Bitcoin because their CC isn't convenient.

The power consumed by the network is independent of the number of users. Regardless if blocks are empty or full the network uses the same amount of power.
Power use is more a function of the price. As price continues to climb we can expect the amount of power used to be approximately equivalent to the amount of Bitcoin mined. 
So if Bitcoin were to reach $1M after the next halving in 2020; thats 900 coins mined per day ; Slightly less than $900Million of electric consumption per day.

I wonder what would happen if large corporations tried to launch their own coins 100% premined? It would show the legitimacy of the idea behind the blockchain and the cryptographic protocols.

Although difficulty adjusts, it does not adjust instantly as hashpower is added. Because hashpower has continually increased in between almost every difficult adjustment over the course of this year, the effective block creation rate is significantly greater than 1 per 10 minutes.
If you want to invest into Bitcoin as a multi-millionaire, you have several options. Investing directly by buying coins. Investing in startups. Investing in mining.
If we assume rational actors, looking at the exponential increases in hashrate over the past year indicates that large investments into mining are still profitable, that is, you will receive more coins by investing $5million into mining rather than buying $5million coins outright. Mining has the added benefit of securing the networks infrastructure as well. So if you are patient, have access to serious financial resources, why would you invest directly, causing much slippage, rather than invest into the network, driving down price temporarily allowing you to buy up more directly for less, while producing coins at a profit. Eventually the mining market will become saturated (once advances in ASIC tech slow down a bit) and you will receive the same or more coins from a $5million investment directly into BTC. At this point we will see a sudden and dramatic price increase to new highs. Mining will become very profitable again and huge investments into mining will occur.

Yeah there are drawbacks and the scheme I presented probably isn't optimal, but the idea of having both parties tie-up a large amount in multi-sig to promote trustless or near trustless transactions is sound.
There certainly are advantages transacting with trusted, accountable parties, but near trustless exchange over the internet has never really been possible until now. It may be somewhat expensive but that may just be the price necessary to secure the incentives.
Perhaps the seller puts in 4 BTC and the buyer puts in 5 BTC. The upfront cost is large, but having both parties having equal or nearly equal stake (and a much larger stake than the item being transferred) gives large incentive to play fairly.

I think this is really the difference between wars funded in fiat versus physical commodity. 
War is always possible regardless of what currency is used. Using a currency pegged to a finite commodity means that nations must raise the money for war via taxation, meaning that more or less they need the consent of the people for war  spending. Using fiat, they can issue a hidden tax that evades most peoples understanding and fund war without as much pushback.

What is really interesting is the idea that several large pools might collude to flood the network with high fee transactions.
Consider 5 or so pools that control 60+% of the hashrate decide to work together to flood the network with high fee transactions of $1 fee's. On average they would get 60% of their money back, and if they can create a backlog large enough that it takes over 1 week to work through, they can then force anyone wanting to use the network to pay greater than $1 per transaction until all the transactions have finally been processed.
Once blocks become organically full this sort of behavior could really sabotage the usability of the network.

Bingo. Of course all the smart money knows this, but not most people in general. Most people who are aware of Bitcoin's existence have no knowledge whatsoever on its workings.
If you ask random people who are aware of bitcoin what their opinion of the current Bitcoin CEO is, very few of them would laugh in your face and say there is no Bitcoin CEO. Most would probably say something "I dont know about the CEO, what do you think?"

I'd be interested if there is any research into how the Bitcoin ATMs are affecting the market.
I've been following Bitcoin since 2009, and like many kicked myself for not following my gut. Since the price rose above $30 I've been wanting to get in but found it uninviting to sign up for an exchange to link a bank account to. I've been hesitant to buy coins online so I've always held off. But recently I was at a location that had a Bitcoin ATM. I was so excited I don't think I've ever fed a machine cash that quickly before.
Took me 30 seconds to get a transaction broadcast to the network.
I've got to imagine other people who have been wanting to get in but no easy way.

18 Months, Start your Engines.
Sometime between now and July 2016, the next halving, there will be a significant price rally that initiates mainstream adoption.
Services are just now becoming accessible to those who are not tech enthusiasts. The idea of downloading a "non-official" wallet and storing value in it, does not appeal to people who don't understand the technology behind Bitcoin. Services that people trust (whether its rightful or not) will bring mainstream adoption to Bitcoin. If services such as Coinbase, Circle, Changetip, BCI, can make themselves idiot proof by somehow insuring/protecting against beginner mistakes we will atleast have the gates ready for mainstream adoption.
With the gates being readied we need incentives to buy Bitcoin. Why buy Bitcoin if you don't care about finance or banking? People will buy it because 
*  The price starts and continues to increase
*  Discounts on purchases 
*  Long stretch of bitcoin stability combined with fiat instability 
* Access to new micropayment markets.
At the next halving, Bitcoin will be 8 years old. The price will increase to compensate for decreased mining rewards. Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, Time, NewEgg and a plethora of other major businesses began accepting Bitcoin in 2014. Several Bitcoin "Banks" opened their doors in 2014 and are already implementing multi-sig controls. In late 2016 Bitcoin will be accepted almost everywhere online.
I'll repeat, at the next halving, Bitcoin will be 8 years old and if it continues its path of acceptance, will be accepted payment method in most places. Bitcoin will experience a price rally, which will attract the attention of the public. Its no longer new and mysterious. Its accepted by most businesses big and small and can be used to buy anything cash can buy, and more. Its not fringe and you aren't considered a social outcast for using bitcoin. This is when people who aren't interested in technology, finance, or politics starts moving a portion of their worth into bitcoin.
Its simply useful to have 10% or more of their value in Bitcoin. Instead of constantly topping up your bitcoin accounts for micropayments and online purchases, you just keep a portion of your value in bitcoin.
Once this happens, the true scarcity of bitcoin will be realized and we will see the hyper-bitcoinization event we are all building for.

I'm just putting myself in the mindset of someone going all in.
In the scenario where Bitcoin becomes the dominant form of digital cash it could certainly reach these levels.
World GDP = $85 Trillion of which ~90% is digital. So $76.5 Trillion in GDP up for grabs to be represented as digital currency. 
$76.5 Trillion/ 21 Million coins = ~$3.6 million per coin
Seems like a pretty unlikely scenario but hey that is the goal right? To replace digital currency? If Bitcoin succeeds it should cap out (not accounting for deflation or increases in productivity) at a value of $3.6 million 2014 US dollars.

If the private key for the Bitcoin itself were there somebody might be inclined to find a way to cleverly break the tamper resistant seal, record the private key information, and then create a counterfeit or repair the original. They could pass on the paper wallet without removing the funds, then after spending it, waiting a certain amount of time and then redeeming the private key for themselves.
With the Dogecoin (or any worthless coin) as an intermediary the third party or decentralized platform could setup a time delay. Such that once the coins were sent to the redemption address there was 48hours delay before the Bitcoin are delivered. Whenever a redemption address is satisfied a message goes out to the network indicating such address has been redeemed. If merchants made it a habit of simply scanning the public address of each of their CryptoCash into a database that kept track of all their balances and interfaced with the network such that whenever a redemption message goes out it checks it against the merchants database. If there is a conflict between merchant and someone else trying to redeem the same code this would be where an intermediary comes into play and resolves disputes. Though if it were easy to make look-alikes that merchants accepted, this could quickly ruin a business that tried to insure the CryptoCash. There would need to be a way to make counterfeits easy to spot. And how do you trust that the company that issued them doesn't issue multiples of each to begin with in disperse regions, essentially operating off of fractional reserves?
I think there are a lot of flaws in the initial proposal but I think there is something to the idea of leveraging multiple blockchains as a way to provide trust.
Maybe the 2nd Crypto would have visible public/private key pairs and each transaction you wanted to prove chain of ownership you move 1 Dogecoin (or whatever coin) from the cryptocash, to your wallet, then back from your merchant wallet with a signed message to the cryptocash wallet, then if there are any disputes the chain of ownership is clear. Though this leaves other vulnerabilities.

Sure the dollar has done well this year, after steadily losing over 95% of its purchasing power over the past 100 years. I wouldn't call that a stable store of value. For the past 100 years you could predict with good certainty that the value of your wealth held in fiat would depreciate year after year due to inflation. I suppose that is a form of stability, but not the kind of stability most want in their wealth/money.

Yeah Open Source isn't the cure to all programming ails, but its kind of analgous to Peer Review in the scientific world.
Just because something has been Peer Reviewed doesn't mean its correct, just that it has been looked over by other knowledgeable professionals that agree it doesn't contain egregious logical or methodological errors. Science that doesn't publish its methods or open itself to peer review is usually relegated to the realm of "belief" or even "superstition"
Open Source is similar, yet different. Open Source simply means anyone has the potential to review the code, not that anybody with knowledge has actually taken a critical eye to it. For this reason we need advocacy of independent audits on a regular basis. Some way to fund these audits as well. I think it is assumed that because major systems are dependent on Open Source software that major businesses would fund their own audits. However I'm not sure this is a safe assumption.
Perhaps "devoid" was an improper word choice.

People bought the rumor and sold the news. 
I'm sure some people are playing the futures to try to lower the BTC price; but the volume is just too small to be controlling the BTC price significantly.
Bitcoin being the first real digital asset is prone to unsustainable spikes, followed by overcorrections. Its actually a property of Bitcoin and tokens themselves. And here is why:
Bitcoin is digitally deliverable globally within 10minute window if so desired. To wrap your head around why this affects the price volatility imagine it as a physical product, like gold, that can be shipped and delivered in any quantity requested within 10minutes of ordering.
When other assets are traded you are often exclusively trading paper that represents those products, not the products themselves. In many cases it is impossible to have physical delivery of financial products. The best you can have is an account that shows a balance. You can't withdraw the product; except in the form of dollars. At the end of the day all you can withdraw is fiat currency; so as long as the entity you are trading with provides the fiat you're happy. This gives institutions and platforms a lot of leeway and wiggle room that ends up grossly inflating the number of claims on financial assets, essentially increasing available supply and controlling the price. Since you can never withdraw the financial products themselves there's really no way to know and as long as they are delivery the fiat nobody really cares.
With Bitcoin individuals can take physical delivery of the product itself, and often do. This causes the supply available for sale to dry up over time. Eventually people catch on and see the price rising to meet limited supply and they buy in too; further reducing the supply. As people withdraw coins from the exchanges and put them in cold storage the exchanges are forced to provide the actual asset. If an exchange has been operating with fractional Bitcoins it is forced to either buy Bitcoins at the market rate somewhere else; thus encouraging further price spikes; or be exposed as fraudulent.
When the momentum finally turns around the price overcorrects for the same reason. The supply is flooded due to excessive fear and continual price dropping. Eventually the panic sellers run out of steam and the price can continue a more genuine discovery path.
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:21:23
The campaign against Bitcoin is obvious, but who cares.
I agree that it proves the revolutionary, disruptive potential of the technology. 
I believe Bitcoin has unstoppable momentum. Short of global nuclear war, I see Bitcoin becoming a massive success in the next 3-5 years. The incentive system is beginning a run-away effect which is evidenced by exponential investments into the mining infrastructure.
These trolls are funny. I feel bad for those that are turned off Crypto by the trolls, but at the same time, Crypto is not ready for those who don't understand it yet. Maybe its a good thing that the trolls scare away people who don't really understand Bitcoin. Eventually we will need everyone on-board; people who don't need to know how a public/private key combo work. Unfortunately we are not there yet.
The trolls may just be a blessing in disguise. Those educated on Crypto push past their troll bullshit with ease.

Yes I think that some form of reputation would add a lot to this system. 
The higher the upfront costs, the lower the risks for both parties.
Say the Seller places 10 BTC in the Multi-sig and the Buyer 11 BTC over an item that is only 1 BTC. The leverage either party would have would be tiny and the cost of not playing fair is incredibly high.

Bitcoin can never have instant transactions on the blockchain and peer to peer is only possible when secured by the property of decentralization ; so I don't understand how you can say that decentralization doesn't matter to you now if that is what is enabling secure P2P payments.
Fiat can already do everything you've described and more; its the decentralization of the network that keeps Bitcoin uncontrollable and gives it the ability to make secure, permissionless, P2P payments, and its the deflationary properties that make it a threat to fiat currencies.

I think its just the market finding itself. Enormous amounts of wealth was generated last year, and now that places are accepting it some early miners and investors are cashing some out. 
Blocks are being produced 10% faster producing 10% more coins entering the market each day.
The underlying protocol is doing great. More users, more merchants, more transactions, more locations, more exposure, more than ever before. The price just needs to find itself for now.
Perhaps we shouldn't let Businesses take advantage of sales burst by simply "Accepting Bitcoin" (through auto fiat conversion). A Business shouldn't be considered to accept Bitcoin if it doesn't hold onto a fraction of it.
I believe that within 24 months Bitcoin will either become a major financial force in the world, or implode. With more and more investment into network infrastructure, when the block rewards halve in 24months (or less) the price must have increased significantly or many miners will turn off their gear.
If we actually see significant hashrate decreases this could signal a loss of security and a loss of confidence.
If that doesn't happen, the network will have reached a level of strength that I believe Bitcoin will be unstoppable save for WW3 or giant solar flares.
If everyone in the world wants Bitcoin and is equally distributed each could have about .002 BTC. 200k Satoshi's for all.

Not really. This system would be free for those who use as much bandwidth as they facilitate. Users are paid by the network for operating nodes. Users who use more than the amount of bandwidth they facilitate would either need to pay BTC to the network (distributed to each node along the way) or find a way to increase the amount they contribute to the network.
This is a way to break free from Telecons as this protocol would incentivize 3rd parties to lay down their own lines or create their own meshnet. People who are not interested in operating a node or people/businesses that use disproportionate amounts of bandwidth would either have to pay for bandwidth or contribute to the network proportional to the amount of resources they use. This is basically the opposite of Comcast. Under this system the vast majority of Internet users would pay little or nothing, and what little they would pay doesn't go to lining the pockets of incompetents but merely paying the lowest market price to transfer data. This is ultimate competition. Every user has the Freedom to become an ISP and collect fee's. Fee's too high in your area? Setup a competing network.

The peak hashrate is likely the moment after the difficulty adjustment is made. If you operate a large mining operation you are getting newer and better hardware in large batches. So large that its most profitable to time your hardware shipments to arrive right as the next difficulty adjustment is made.
By turning the equipment on right around the difficulty adjustment (before its effects have time to shorten block creation times) the difficulty doesn't increase as much as it would have otherwise. This would allow the mining firm to extract more profits until the next difficulty adjustment.
If large mining operators talk to each other and their hardware suppliers they might collude across the board to make this happen. I'm not sure but I believe this actually would make mining more profitable for everybody as it keeps difficulty lower than it *should* be. However it also exhausts blocks quicker than *should* be which means the next halving could come sooner than 24 months.
@_date: 2014-07-13 14:12:01
So what is at play here?
People turning off their inefficient mining hardware after previous difficulty increases.
ASIC manufacturers turning off their latest "test" batch to finally ship out. 
The next difficulty increase could be the biggest yet. As the ASIC manufacturers turn on to test their newest technology, as people receive their orders, and as more people get into mining because of the perceived slow down in difficulty increase. Who knows

No $0.25 fee here. Yes, when you go to use the blockchain to make a withdrawal you will take a miners fee (if you so choose) but off-chain transactions allow the accumulation of micro-crowd-funding. Is there any other payment network that supports the sending of value in such small increments?

Hong Kong Protesters are using mesh-net on a widescale right now. Meshnets grow stronger with more users. The Old-School Traditional Internet is connected at the core through "BackBones" which are owned and operated by corporate, government, military interests. These backbones are centralized points of failure that can be exploited or manipulated. In addition, the cables and frequencies that the internet is transmitted over are owned by corporate/government interests, taking another point of control away from the people.
The Meshnet is a concept embodied by many technologies and services. The main idea is to use overlapping WiFi signals on cellphones, routers, laptops, etc to create a new Internet that cannot be censored or controlled. You may be saying to yourself "But there will be many connectivity gaps and at some point the meshnet will need to connect to the traditional Internet" This is where Bitcoin and the Cryptographic revolution come in.
Some Protocols for the Meshnet are now maturing, things like BitCloud, and MaidSafe. 
These Protocols incentivize people to provide bandwidth, storage, and servers to the meshnet. The protocols use cryptographic techniques that allow people to a) Prove that they something of value, harddrive space for instance, and b) Receive payment for providing the service.
The data on the meshnet is orders of magnitude more secure, both in privacy and in reliability. Data is encrypted and broken in millions or billions of bits and those bits are copied and spread throughout the meshnet like grains of sand. No one place stores a full copy of your data, yet many, many copies of your data exist.
The more traffic your facilitate on your network, the more Bitcoins (or "local" crypto) you are paid. The more space your provide for storage, the more cloud computing power, the more you are paid.
Just like Bitcoin mining, we will see an arms race to provide network connectivity, storage space, computing power, at cheaper and cheaper prices. The charts below are the amount of computing power invested into the Bitcoin network in the:
1) Past Year 
2) Past 2 Years 
3) Past 5 Years  
This is the kind of accelerated growth we will see when the Meshnet is given the proper incentives.
This is a real chance for meaningful revolution without any kind of war. I say it is a revolution because it overturns the control of information and financial systems.
It also empowers individuals to be paid by a non-human entity. You work for the protocol and the protocol rewards everyone fairly without taking a cut for itself. Yes, its still funded by humans paying into the system, but its a different kind of control system.
Information, Coinage, Employment. These systems are ripe for inversion. The traditional systems will simply become less relevant and the new systems more profitable, more relevant. It will be analogous to the industrial revolution. Agricultural and traditional jobs simply became less relevant compared to industrial jobs.
You might think to yourself "The powers that be wont take this sitting down" and I say to that; they are certainly running out of time to do anything about stopping it. The nature of these programs is that there is no single point of failure. In order to stop it they must stop everyone who is using these programs. And as they stop people, it becomes more and more profitable for those who keep running, just further incentivizing it. These programs are all open-source, which allows anyone to review the code at anytime. This results in secure code devoid of "backdoors."
At this point there are only 3 options I envision that will keep the Cryptographic revolution from occurring.
1) Solar Flare/Gamma Ray Burst/International Pandemic (Rare Life Ending Events; Non human based)
2) Outright War on Cryptography which ends in full Dark Age; Possible WW3
3) Quantum Computers developed in the future are able to decrypt classical encryption. However Quantum Computers would also be able to create unbreakable encryption, which could lead the way to a new Cryptographic revolution.
I see  as the most probable of these scenarios, but practical Quantum Computing is still decades out and even then we may be able to anticipate developments in Quantum Cryptography that allow a transition to the new system before opportunists. It would seem that if the first Cryptographic revolution is successful then Quantum Computers would be developed for the express purpose of aiding the Protocol rather than destroying it.
The Hong Kong Protests may be the ignition to set the revolution off. Meshnets need users, the more users, the stronger and faster they are. Once meshnets break a certain thresh-hold they will be an attractive Internet option.
Instead of paying an ISP, you will load Bitcoin into your Meshnet router. Each packet of data will have a tiny fraction of Bitcoin attached to it. You can offset your internet costs by making some harddrive space available or allowing your router to be used as a node to facilitate other peoples traffic. The future is arriving everyday.

Create 2 addresses (multisig?) one for "YES" (to adopt the proposal in OP) and a 2nd address for "NO".

Great discussion, but I disagree with the notion that changing the algorithm would do anything for increasing the value or security of the network.
I think what we are really seeing is that Bitcoin has become more successful and more popular, more quickly than initially anticipated. Its so profitable to mine Bitcoin right now that miners are willing to sell for sub $500.  In 6 years (or slightly less with continuous exponential increases in hashrate) the mining rewards/inflation will be 25% of what they are today. As mining rewards decrease the price will either have to significantly increase or miners will turn off their equipment and hashrate will go down. If hashrate continues increasing then it must be profitable to mine Bitcoin, or lots of people are eating their losses.
Regardless of the inflation rate, the price of Bitcoin is so low because of low adoption rates. We still aren't ready for mainstream, but we are getting there. The price of Bitcoin could easily be $100,000 right now even with our current consensus algorithm and inflation rate if we had mainstream adoption.
I think that mainstream adoption will happen in Q4 2016. Bitcoin will build infrastructure, applications, novel use cases, legitimacy, and reach new highs in 2015 and 2016. But it wont be until the next blockreward halving when BTC increases an order of magnitude over a few weeks. 
That is when we will see mainstream adoption. Most people will already have had some experience with Bitcoin, but not really invested into it, just use a little when they need to for some game or application. But when these same people see "That $50 I had in my BTC account is now $500" combined with their practical experience and BTC's 8 year history, that is the order of events that will see BTC launched mainstream. We will see several orders of magnitude in price increase, accompanied by probably the biggest price correction in human history. Many will become obscenely wealthy, and many will go broke. It will likely be a memorable moment for much of humanity.

Very cool idea but having some experience working with DNA, I think the genome part is a bit of marketing ploy.
They are certainly not sequencing your genome base by base. The cost of doing so is still quite high. They will likely be sending your samples to a company that uses gene chips, that identify the presence or absence of already identified genetic structures. Usually this is done to compare relative activity levels of genes.
For instance, treat one batch of cells with high sugar medium and another batch with normal sugar, and another with low sugar. Process the samples, extract your genetic material and send it out to be chipped. Its the easiest science on the planet because you almost always find something. 
Anyways, this technology is useful for looking at differences in expression levels of already identified genes. This is probably what they mean by compressing the data to be simply the "differences between you and other humans"
What they are doing is collecting an enormous (and enormously valuable) database on a (hopefully) large number of samples. They will very likely combine this with other demographic data to sell to data mining companies to look for trends.
Since the data doesn't necesarily represent you in anyway (other than providing enough randomness through thousands of data points) what are you really getting with this service? You are getting a unique seed. They get a giant database of human genetic information. These databases are incredibly valuable.

Create dozens of paperwallets, all in triplicate.
Store varying denominations on each.
0.01BTC, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5; etc.
Store the extra copies with trusted individuals, and don't forget to encrypt them all!

This is certainly worrying. We desperately need decentralized incentives to fund development. Maybe we can push to raise 2000 Bitcoins to support development in 2015. I would rather see sidechains happen in a hardfork on the core protocol. Lets raise some money and tackle the most needed items on our wishlist and then see where that takes us.
If we can simply get off the launch-pad there will be so much money involved from so many competing sources we wont have to worry about a single entity trying something like this. We'd have 100 entities courting these developers.
Bitcoin will make it or break it by the next halfing in late 2016. Lets keep development conflicted by corporate interests until then.

My belief is that the venture capitalists who have invested millions into the mining infrastructure are doing so (or trying to keep up) until the next halving (expected Aug 2016). I expect that they are holding a fraction of the coins they mine in anticipation of significant valuation increase in 2 years. The exponential climb in hashrate is somewhat guaranteed until then as VC's fight for coinshare. 
The next halving event is what we should all be building for, its the real test for Bitcoin. By that time merchant Bitcoin acceptance should be relatively widespread, wallet and multi-sig technologies should be improved and simplified for non-technical people. As we approach the next halving, value must increase or a significant number of miners will leave. It seems more likely that Bitcoin being well established (7 years old at that point) the next halving will spur investors, speculators, consumers, to significantly increase the price in the couple of months that lead up to the next halving. And then of course a correction after the halving.
Bitcoin is undervalued currently IMO.

Winner! 
This has been my conclusion for an individual that wants to store several Bitcoins. Make paper wallets of various denominations (0.5 BTC, 0.1 BTC, 0.05 BTC, etc), have them BIP38 encrypted, laminated, and make them in duplicate or triplicate and store extra copies with trusted parties (they are encrypted so you are good). 
When you need to spend BTC, simply import 1 or 2 Private Keys of the wallets that most closely match how much you'll be spending.
Bitcoin is kind of a mix of Cash and Gold. You wouldn't want to walk in and out of your Gold Vault every time you wanted a to buy a Latte. You dont want to expose all your finances by storing your coins in a single address.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:59:02
That appears to be the case.
I don't understand how so much money is flowing into these destined to fail projects. None of these tokens build off the decentralized revolution that Bitcoin kicked off. They are a way for companies to raise money without going through normal securities regulations.
Attempts to create alternative currencies and unlicensed securities sales have been happening for decades and until Bitcoin all have been shut down and destroyed by governments. The only reason Bitcoin has not been shut down is because it cannot be shut down. It can be stifled but not destroyed. Governments look weak when they pass laws that cannot be enforced; so they have not gone after Bitcoin.
Confused and Naive spectators do not know the history of attempts at private, non-state controlled currencies. They see that Bitcoin is allowed to flourish and mistakenly believe that all "Crypto" is created equal in technical merit and in the eyes of regulators.
Surely if you don't need the protections (and inefficiency) of decentralization if the State is friendly towards your project ; so I can understand why some of these naive investors feel that centrally controlled projects are technologically "superior" to Bitcoin.
However these people either do not understand the history of attempts at private, non-government issued money, or they are making a very high stakes bet that all governments of the world will be friendly towards these centralized projects.
See that is a major difference between decentralized and centralized.
With a truly decentralized project like Bitcoin, it would take the coordinated effort of all governments in the world to shut it down.
With centralized projects it requires that every government in the world consents to giving up some of their power to the CEO's of these projects. 
Centralized projects have leaders who can be corrupted or killed.
Centralized projects have central points of failure and can not effectively resist government intervention.
How many coins/projects would absolutely die if a government decided to arrest the project coordinators? How many coins/projects would survive an attack on their network infrastructure?
Governments will almost certainly crack down on ICO's.
Why should any company go through the expensive and laborious process of complying with SEC and other regulations to sell stock if they can freely raise money with token sales?
ICO's are a direct threat to the stock market. Companies will transition to ICO's over stocks. They'll offer a trade in; and allow shareholders to trade their shares for an equal stake in tokens.
Then once there are no more shareholders, companies will not be obligated or controlled by "shareholder" but by general sentiment of tokenholders. No need to worry about SEC or other regulations. Need more money, just issue more tokens.
Why would any company bother with stocks and the SEC if they could get access to the same capital but without regulations?
Its always possible that governing bodies make game-changing decisions like to allow ICO's to continue unfettered ; but in my opinion it is just a matter of time until ICO's are highly regulated. When this happens the whole market will probably take a sharp dive until people understand there is a difference between ICO's and Bitcoin.

Much of the "structure" of the human-social-political world are simply mutually agreed upon illusions, nationalism being one of them. 
Its interesting how it feels so natural that we have these giant nation states when really its an idea that humans have come to an unspoken agreement on. 
Nation states can be dissolved (theoretically) as simply as turning off the TV. If peoples idea's and beliefs about what constitutes a just social structure were to change in unison, change would happen overnight, frictionless.
But that never happens. Change never happens purely for the good of the whole. Change only happens when individuals recognize opportunity and take advantage of those opportunities.
Bitcoin is the system that incentivizes change. Bitcoin doesn't ask people to change because its noble or righteous, but because its profitable. This is ultimately what will make Bitcoin successful.

Yeah they are fascinating and impressive absolutely. The same way an ant colony is impressive and fascinating. Amazing to see the unconscious coordination of millions or billions of individual units creating an organized structure that none on its own could perceive. 
The specialization of each unit for specific tasks within society, and the level of skill which the units execute their tasks is astounding. 
Impressive and Fascinating, yet humans are just like a giant ant colony run amok on this planet. As a species we behave unconsciously, yet our individual conscious minds allow us to manipulate nature like no other species. Humans must develop some kind of supra-consciousness to regulate human activity OR human units must collect into smaller self-sustaining groups. If these conditions are not met resources will be expended at too rapid a rate and incite civilization and perhaps species collapse.

Its certainly possible, but I'm very curious as to how blockchains could be secured without the mining incentive.
Securing the blockchain using token rewards was a genius idea. If somebody has come up with a way to secure a blockchain without the resource requirements of mining then that method will be even more groundbreaking.
So the question is, what is this method? If something that groundbreaking has been discovered why didn't he write a book about this new method to secure global ledgers?
If a method like that has been discovered I would think it would be found by developers within the coinspace and discussed widely before some outside analyst was able to penetrate the technical depths of the subject matter.

But doesn't BIP38 just add an extra step to the process of getting the Private Key, so even if its a terrible passphrase (for example the letter "a") it just means that its easy to retrieve the Private Key from guessing or brute force. Isn't still slightly more security than leaving the private key unencrypted?
I mean certainly I think its foolish to assume it is safe to store encrypted copies online, but if you generate your keys offline and encrypt them it seems like a nice way to increase security.  Multi-sig is also a good security measure it seems, 2 people would have to lose their keys simultaneously to compromise the system.

This should really be the goal for increasing interest and adoption. However once everyone is owning and using BTC crowdfunding campaigns will have such an enormous donor base that tips of 100 Satoshi's could easily add up. 
Imagine a global fundraising campaign where 100million people donate 100 Satoshi's each.
That comes out to 100 BTC, which depending on the price could fund major infrastructure projects. At 100k/BTC that is 10million raised for what amounts to a $0.10 tip.
For fundraising any tip amount shouldn't be considered spammy.
For spreading adoption or trying to entice other people, anything below $1 is probably not all that enticing.

So if the coins are bought at; near; or above market price there would be a strong motivation to announce the price. With everyone expecting an announcement pending above market average, if that announcement doesn't occur there will be a price drop.

So much negativity here. The reality is that many people are 90% invested in USD. While I agree that 90% seems high, only you can determine what makes sense for your life. This world has so much potential, yet the peoples productivity is severely hampered by financial politics. I see Bitcoin as one of the few potential tools that can solve this problem and give the world a chance to flourish. 
Bitcoin offers a way out without old-fashioned revolution. Its a revolution of consent. As fiat currencies fail and assets are seized, Bitcoin will increasingly be seen as an asset that will hold on to value and if stored properly, cannot be seized. A runaway effect could easily occur when one currency fails, some seeking safe-haven buy Bitcoin, which spurs on price increase. The significant daily increases in price could cause a buy panic in nations with weak currency, further devaluing the local currencies. Could result in a domino effect where the weakest, most inflationary currencies are knocked out, one after another, as Bitcoin's price continues to rise.
In countries where the general public has not experienced the effects of excessive inflation, Bitcoin will probably be seen as "Too Expensive" for all but the rich and early investors. The general public will feel they have missed the boat. They might dabble with it for online purchases, but converting the majority of their net worth won't even cross their minds. It won't cross their minds until they experience the effects of inflation on their purchasing power in a human perceivable timespan. When the cost of groceries goes up 1% USD every week but stays the same relative to Bitcoin, people won't care if BTC is $25,000 or $250,000; they know that if they keep their money in BTC their purchasing power will either stay the same or go up.
In this way the global financial system can be significantly augmented simply by creating a technology that takes advantage of peoples drive for self-interest. No cities have to crumble, just a self-interest driven movement of value from a financial system controlled by a shadowy elite, to a financial system out in the open for anybody to participate, develop, and understand the rules. A financial system where the people can hold onto a much greater fraction of the profits of their labor. 
I hope that we see this post a year from now and everybody says "I wish that was me" the same way many of us look at the early miners or early investors. I believe that if Bitcoin doesn't fail in the next 2 years, the world has no option but to see it significantly compete with currency, stores of value, and payment systems of all types, globally. $85Trillion USD Global GDP to be represented by 21million units places BTC at ~4million USD (2014 Value) or 95Kg's of Gold.
Thats right, I just said 1 BTC = 95 Kilograms of Gold 
Deal with it.

I'm interested in a discussion of security of cold storage techniques.
Paper Wallet Vs Encrypted USB drives?
Making excessive copies of paper wallets for redundancy increases your risk of someone getting your private key. Whereas an encrypted flash drive you can make as many as you want and not worry about what happens if someone finds it. USB drives are sensitive to static shock. Paper wallets can be destroyed in a fire. You cannot lose the encryption key to a paper wallet. Paper wallets are cheaper. You could print dozens of paper wallets on a single sheet of paper. You could print thousands of paper wallets, laminate them, record their public addresses on your PC and distribute them amongst safety deposit boxes, trusted family members, etc. Then whenever your hot wallet accumulates greater than X BTC transfer it to the next Public address in your list. Essentially making currency notes of X denomination for easy incremental importation.

Your email has never been hacked (to your knowledge) because it wasn't an obvious financial target, yet.
Bitcoin addresses are  public and so are their contents. Once people know you have Bitcoin there is incentive to steal it from you.
The software and protocol are secure. Your computer, your email, your internet connection, these may not be secure.
Right now to safely hold your funds I suggest researching into paper wallets. In the future you will be able to pay bank like entities to hold on to your BTC for your. There will be other Bank like entities that you loan your BTC to at interest.

Interesting there are several similarities with Bitcoin. The money is all publicly viewable. The money doesn't move, just ownership. The money cannot be "counterfeited" as it requires a certain amount of work by nature to create stone money of that size, it is considered valued.
However once western civilization got hold they were like "Hey I can just ship in tons of stones and control the entire civilization." 
The blockchain doesn't hold this same possibility. Extra coins simply cannot be printed, even by an advanced alien civilization. Maybe a little bit ahead of scheduled, but no more than the maximum 21million.

Could the community come together to create a Bitcoin fork saved for the future; just in the case a 51% attack occurs. Pools/Community agrees in advance that were such an attack to occur that the solution would be to update with the hardfork.
But what could be done in the code? We could try to change the PoW, but thats a bit risky technically and bucking all those who made big ASIC investments probably wouldn't do well. At the same time it could attract a more decentralized network. I'm sure someone smarter than me could come up with a better contingency plan.

If they are encrypted using the same passphrase if the paper wallets are physically obtained it would be trivial to import the private keys once they have a single passphrase. If each is unique and only holds a small fraction of the total sum it greatly reduces the incentive to crack it.
If the thieves estimate it would take 2 weeks to crack the passphrase which would lead to 100 Bitcoins, I could easily see them spending the time and resources to do so. If on the other hand the 100 Bitcoins were distributed amongst 1000 Paper wallets with unique BIP38 encryption, and the thieves estimate it would take 2 weeks to crack each, well at the current valuation they probably wouldn't find it worth their time. This would give the original "owner" plenty of time to retrieve their backups which may be difficult to retrieve and then transfer to new addresses. 
If you trust that your passphrase cannot be cracked, then I suppose a single passphrase is fine, maybe something like:

With this in hand, at 100k transactions (addresses) per second, how many years before we statistically repeat an address? Since the addresses are created at random, we aren't simply going to exhaust all possible addresses before repeating any. We have to rely on the fact the pool of addresses is so insanely enormous that its unlikely we will ever randomly generate 2 addresses that are the same. After that pool of unused addresses is reduced to a certain point (I dont remember, some cryptanalyst or statistician could say) it becomes likely that an address is repeated.

A whole BTC per paper wallet? In a future where 1 BTC = $100k - $1million that is quite a lot of money to be importing to hot wallets and the act of redeeming your private keys for that much value will be a security risk in and of itself.
Consider printing out 300 Paper wallets. BIP38 encrypt them. Laminate them. Then separate them. Store 0.1 BTC per wallet. Even at just $1000/BTC each paper wallet is worth ~$100, just a few of these will suffice for most purchases.
Store some in a safety deposit box
Store some with trusted family members
Store some in a safe buried somewhere safe
Store a very minute amount in places that you can easily physically access

The idea of being offline makes most sense in the context of loading an OS from disk that doesn't write or access the hard drives.
If you load into a clean Linux distribution from DVD and are completely disconnected from the Internet it becomes incredibly difficult for malware to have an entry point since as far as the OS is concerned there are no drives with data that could execute malware.
Running off the DVD won't have access to the hard drives, though mounted disks like external hard-drives and USB drives represent a point of entry, these are easier to control.

I wonder if there is a way to interconnect the data itself and Bitcoins.
Such that 1kb or 1Mb = 1 Satoshi. The act of sending and recieving data simultaneously spends BTC.
This would incentivize individuals to become nodes to offset their data use costs, bringing more and more nodes, more security into the system. Hopefully reaching a state where 95% of users are also nodes, meaning that most users have free access and the power users, ddosers, excessive torrenters, end up paying typical users BTC for their traffic. An internet where each byte costs Crypto could limit DDOS problems, just like adding network transactions fee's fixed Bitcoins DDOS.
Actually wasn't there a white paper coming out with this exact idea?

I've never had to pay more than 0.0001 BTC and the transactions are processed within an hour; and I've several times forgotten to pay the miner fee entirely and after several hours eventually all the transactions get incorporated. Off-chain transactions which currently take no fee's are also something that works with Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions can be expensive if you want it to be. Competition for tipping platforms, and the inevitable decentralized off-chain tipping platform (itself ledgered by a quicker cheaper blockchain) puts this market squarely in the realm for Bitcoin.

Changetip and other services that hold onto your Bitcoins for you are like first generation Bitcoin Banks. Learn how to withdrawal your 100,000 Satoshi's from Changetip into a local wallet on your computer.
Then learn how to move 50,000 Satoshi's to a paper wallet and retrieve it.
Once you've done this a few times you'll be much more familiar with the Bitcoin technology. 
By the time major banks support Bitcoin there will be less risk, but also less potential for gains.
I predict 3 major Bitcoin Banks.
Traditional Banks forced to use Bitcoin to balance their ledgers in light of security issues.
Full Reserve Bitcoin Banks. You pay the bank monthly or quarterly to secure your funds for you and you can prove at any time that these funds are in your name and withdrawable.
Partial Reserve Bitcoin Banks. These banks pay you monthly or quarterly to hold your Bitcoins. Very likely to be the most popular if they aren't inundated with scams.

The multi-sig custodial accounts that Andreas mentioned in addressing the Canadian Senate. These seem like a natural step forward. Where you can open an account that requires 2 of 2, 2 of 3, or even 3 of 3 signatures to spend. Coinbase can act as a custodian that helps safeguard funds, but doesn't have power to spend.
Normally just approving all transactions, but if statistical patterns indicate that your key may be compromised, Coinbase can ask for you to login with your 2FA and approve the transaction.
Multi-Sig just opens up so many cool possibilities for organization. Eventually we should be able to use an arbitrary number of signatures. Maybe even different rules for combinations of signatures. 2 of 6 for Signatures A+B, but 4 of 6 for Signatures C+D+E+F. Setting up Family accounts, either both parents must agree to release funds or all the children must agree.

My belief is that once financial interests are satisfied with their asset grab, interest rates will rise, debt/credit issued, and then inflation.
By hoarding the monetary base and not lending it out they don't experience the effects of inflation. They can slowly spend that money hoarding up assets without affecting prices too much.
At a certain point they will not be able to continue buying assets without increasing the prices.
At that point asset prices will skyrocket, and suddenly interest rates will rise, credit will flow. People will need the credit just to keep up with prices. True Debt-Slavery will be born. But I'm no economist.

I don't believe it will get there, but hopefully you can get some cheap coins!
Because difficulty is only adjusted every few weeks and hashrate is changing constantly, Bitcoin production is stable over long time periods, but can vary over shorter durations.
For instance according to Blockchain.info there have been 318 blocks mined in the past 48 hours. I used blocks 315576 and 315258 as examples, generated almost exactly 48 hours apart.
Bitcoin *should* produce blocks every 10 minutes for stable production. That's 6 blocks per hour, 6*24= 144 blocks per day. Over 48 hours Bitcoin should produce 288 blocks, resulting in 7200 Bitcoins
In reality as new mining rigs are developed and turned on between difficulty adjustments there is variance. 315576 - 315258 = 318 Blocks, resulting in 7950 Bitcoins! 
That is an additional 750 Bitcoins being produced every 2 days, which is over 10% of the total Bitcoin production.
10% is roughly the drop in price we just experienced. I'm sure there are a lot of other factors playing into the price, but production does not remain stable regardless of the hashrate. We could see the next halving substantially sooner than 24months if mining continues to grow at the same exponential rate it is now.
I guess we will see, does the price recover at the next difficulty adjustment?

You can and should encrypt your private keys. Unlike gold or other forms of property it cannot be seized upon your death. That doesn't mean intimidation isn't and wont continue to be a part of this world, but the protocol does in fact reduce the reliance on violence to protect property. It is ones choice to hold onto the private key/encryption key until death. One has no choice in giving up other forms of property after death. I think this changes things. Doesn't eliminate violence and intimidation by any means, but certainly changes the relationship.

With that amount of value at stake it really would seem best to follow a strategy that makes your stash unwelcoming for potential thieves as well as mitigating the risk that you will lose or forget how to access your coins.
If it were me, I would use several techniques for storage.
For long term storage I would create BIP38 encrypted Paper Wallets in Triplicate, sealed in laminate. Store no more than 0.1 BTC per paper wallet. Store your copies in geographically/politically separated regions. This will require a significant time investment to print out 3000+ paper wallets, test your decryption method on each one (offline, airgapped, linux of course), and then load them up. You will also want to keep your own record book recording the public addresses of each wallet so that as you import your private keys for use, you can mark them off your ledger. That will be useful since at least 2/3rds of your paper wallets will not be in your hand.
By splitting the wallets up such that none hold more than 10million Satoshi's keeps the addresses from being highly sought after by thieves. It also makes the hot wallet that you import your coins to less of a target. If you are importing private keys controlling whole BTC at a time it could make your system a higher level target than importing fractions. 
Also if BTC does gain significantly in value a whole BTC could be $5,000 or more. I'd be pretty nervous about my security if I had to import multiple Bitcoins at a time from a paper wallet.
If you have 2 other parties that you completely trust will respect your wishes AND will continue existing in the future, Multi-sig is has a lot of advantages to it. However you must find people that you trust, that will be around, and that understand Bitcoin.
Traveling with 1000 paper wallets that are laminated would be conspicuous. One would want to ship the encrypted wallets and ensure their arrival prior to traveling. This is also why having several encrypted backups is useful, if something goes wrong in shipping, the backups are protected, and since they are encrypted the funds are safe.
Paper wallets would survive EMP, but not a house fire. You could engrave encrypted private keys into stone tablets, though that would become very heavy.
Engraving private keys directly into Platinum coins or Bars would probably be a good mitigation strategy against fire. Platinum is very dense so it should hold they key for a long time, unlike gold which is much softer. Platinum doesn't oxidize readily under normal conditions. Has a relatively high melting point. However these would hold value that can also be stolen. Probably better to engrave private keys into stones.
I keep coming back to multiple encrypted paper wallets of relatively low denomination OR Multi-sig (if you have 2 trusted parties). You could even take a picture of your encrypted paper wallets with a sufficiently high definition camera, and store that image in an encrypted file container. You could easily travel with the encrypted image. You could even include some steganography so that once you get into the file container you have several images you have to apply a process to, to reveal the image of your encrypted paper wallets, and then you would need to know the decryption key to each wallet.
There are lots of complicated ways to store your coins. I wonder what will prevail as accepted storage standards.

Every entry into the ledger will require a tiny transaction fee. As the number of applications of the blockchain increases these tiny fee's will begin to add up to greater than 25BTC per 10minutes.

Yes, I tried to get another post through earlier this morning with more details of my plan, so here is a copy and paste:
There has been a lot of discussion regarding implementing increased blocksize. I believe the dynamic distributed nature of Bitcoin may mean that consensus will only be reached when it is deemed necessary, when we experience full blocks.
Before we experience full blocks organically, regular stress-tests of the protocol should be undertaken to understand how the network might react to sudden increased usage. Furthermore the financial costs of performing such a stress test is rather negligible, we should understand what may occur if a nefarious actor performed such a "test" unannounced.
The goal is to send as many transactions as possible starting at 23:00 UTC today (Approx 5hours from this post) until 23:59. I think it would be great to generate a backlog of 20Mb worth of transactions, to see how long it takes to work through the backlog, and how the backlog displaces other transactions.
You can view the backlog here 
You can write a script to generate transactions or manually. Using a phone App it is a quick process to scan a QR code, any address will do.
For purposes of analyzing this test I will be sending dust transactions starting at 23:00 UTC to this address:
12qLgVrkW561PbpfvokKwfj7CPjCVwwCTS 
Also if you are feeling up to it, double the suggested transaction fee.

Wow that was close enough in proximity to the experiment that your transaction delay could easily have been a downstream effect. I wonder how long transactions could be delayed with a more robust effort this Friday?
If we send transactions with a higher than average fee the stress-test transactions could displace many legitimate transactions. I think this is exactly the kind of test a non-fragile system like Bitcoin needs.

Good eye! This is a bit embarrassing, as I goofed up some of the numbers in the OP and totally messed up this analysis. It is further confused by the fact that the timestamps I wrote down for broadcast times do not match the broadcast times listed by the transaction ID on blockchain.info
I will do a more thorough job with the next analysis, but I distinctly remember it was quite a few blocks before confirmation, I fell asleep waiting for the transactions to be confirmed.
For the next experiment I suggest we all use a public donation address to stress-test. This way we can all watch as the transactions come in. Perhaps Gavin's and/or other core developers donation address would be a good choice.
To your other point, 3 Transactions per minute by a lone individual certainly impacts the network by only 1-5%, but considering blocks are on average half full, just 20 to 50 people participating could overwhelm the network and cause a large backlog. Considering there is an approximately 2Mb backlog at any given time already, any additional stress should only add to that.

Considering that BU will require vendors to update their software (or the payment processors that process BTC for them) it is likely that they will continue to only accept Bitcoin and not Bigcoin.
Merchants have not agreed to accept Bigcoin; they accept Bitcoin. If payment processors like Bitpay start accepting Bigcoin on behalf of their merchants; that may constitute a breach of contract.
Bigcoin may get traded on exchanges; but payment processors would be shooting themselves in the foot if they accept alt-coins in place of Bitcoin.
Bigcoin relies on the entire ecosystem updating their software before their Blockchain forks off. This simply will not happen.
Bigcoin will fork off; nobody will accept it because the ecosystem has not upgraded in unison; it will have tiny market value; and eventually die. Once this process finishes Bitcoin will have a resurgence of confidence in its resistance to coercion and the price will forking skyrocket.

The idea that governments or corporations would willingly give up their power of inflation; and power to censor transactions is delusional.
No government or corporation is going to produce a cryptocurrency which is finite, publicly mineable, irrreversible, and non-permissioned. It simply will not happen. 
Bitcoin will never be used by the mainstream; I'll agree with that; but Bitcoin will go mainstream. 
Governments, corporations, banks; we do not live in a unified world of perfect trust. Governments distrust each other, corporations distrust each other; banks distrust everyone.
Bitcoin is value and value transfer without trust. Governments, corporations, and banks will come to understand the value of making Bitcoin the basis of wealth.
Banks and Governments do not have to trust each other to transact Bitcoin. They don't have to worry if the books are being cooked or if the money is "really there"
Bitcoin is a revolution of many things; but one of the most important is that Bitcoin is redefining the meaning of "Wealth"
It will take time for institutions to understand this. Plus they really need to prove to themselves that they couldn't possibly offer anything that could compete with Bitcoin which would give them any meaningful edge; that it would be more profitable for them to work with the Bitcoin blockchain itself.

Its obviously a catch-22 but merchant adoption is necessary for mainstream acceptance. Using a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase to facilitate payment makes it easy and less risky for companies to accept BTC than outright acceptance. And yes, those companies are going to dump most of the coins until they can use them to save money or anticipate price movement. There is nothing wrong about that. It is far better to be able to spend your BTC at 100,000 places that autoconvert to fiat than not being able to do anything accept hold your BTC and trade it with friends. It may depress the price a bit but is necessary in the big picture.
Halving won't "magically" appreciate the value of the currency units, there is no way to predict the future 100%, if we could there would be no volatility. However seeing the momentum in the growth of network infrastructure (mining, merchants, wallets, new services) there are now thousands of highly intelligent, highly capable, and in some cases, highly connected individuals working full-time on growing out this network. Infrastructure is developing like a fractal in many directions. Most will be niche or dead ends. Some will flourish. The incentive system is strong and it exists, the liklihood of all fractal branches to shrivel up and die simultaneously is (in my personal estimation) tiny. It seems your personal estimation puts that liklihood much higher, and thats fine. If everyone agreed on Bitcoin's future there would be no volatility.

There is a certain amount of value in the world that is represented by currency. The GDP about represents the amount of value created and consumed over a year. The Global GDP is about $72Trillion. This doesn't really count holdings/savings in assets.
But $72Trillion of value needs to be represented annually; if no coins are lost, eventually 21million coins, thats ~3.4million USD (2014) per coin.
Now, that is ignoring a large fraction of value. If Bitcoin becomes the globally dominating currency in which value of abstract goods are denominated in; the stock market for instance (63 Trillion) that adds another $3 million per coin (~6.4million)

It is a finite digitally transferable asset that became recognized as a way to pay for grey market and illicit goods due to the Silk Road story. 
A lot of people suddenly became interested in Bitcoin, and began buying it. Because the units themselves can be transferred and withdrawn shortly after trading, this caused temporary supply shortages and the price began booming.
The booming price brought in speculators and investors, which is when the price began shooting up astronomically. There were also some shady exchange practices occurring which seemed to also push the price up.
At a certain point people who had gotten casually involved in mining at the early stage realized that they had thousands or millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins; and they began the process of unloading them.

I think most people agree that Bitcoin is increasing the max transaction rate, we just don't agree how. 
As the transaction ceiling is approached transaction fee's will steadily increase. Right now it only costs about $40 per block in fee's to completely fill it up 1800 TPS * 0.0001 = 0.18BTC. However if each block were filled the transaction fee's would increase drastically. 
For instance as the NASDAQ experiment gets off the ground we may see blocks start filling up. I'm not sure how often they will be writing to the WWL from the ColoredCoins protocol, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see 1000 transactions per block. This could cause competition for fee's. NASDAQ may be willing to pay $1 per write to the WWL, if they want to do say 1800 transactions per block you and everyone else will have to outspend NASDAQ to get their transaction included. Now $1 per transaction is quite ridiculous, that would be over $172K in a 16hour day on transaction fee's.
Clearly the transaction rate ceiling must be raised, but even without it being raised its not difficult to see how a fee market combined with real-world utility (WWL writes) can drive up the total transaction fee's into a significant demand for BTC.

For instance I'd love to be able to get a ding when each block is found. If it is found in less than 10minutes a high pitched ding, greater than 10, a low pitched ding. With the pitch being dependent on the distance from the 10minute mark.

@_date: 2017-02-05 21:28:11
There aren't any financial incentives currently, but increasing the cost of running a node will cause less people to run a node. 
SegWit + Lightning does provide a financial incentive to run a node, and this is the direction we need to move in; we need to incentivize nodes.
Bitcoin was designed to incentivize the security of the system. If we are going to talk about how "Bitcoin was designed" then I think it needs to be mentioned that when Bitcoin was "designed" a user, node, miner, and wallet were unified. The original wallet also functioned as a node, and as a miner. While the developers were smart enough to realize that at some point these functions would split off; they also did not believe it would happen so quickly; before the incentive system could be re-balanced to take this into account.

I've been experimenting with a concept called "CryptoCubes"
3D print a 1" cube that contains your seed embedded into the plastic itself. Then 3D print a hollow cube around the cube with embedded text. In order to retrieve your key you must break the outer cube.
The real issue with this is that you must perform all of these steps yourself. You could encrypt each word of your seed and then embed the encrypted words in a cryptocube for extra security, but you still would want to perform this yourself rather than send it off to someone else.
Etching your seed phrase into a metal card with a laser engraver/cutter would be more durable.

As coins are lost the value of each remaining Bitcoin increases.
As bitcoin increases in value, people will work with smaller and smaller fractions of bitcoin; meaning that the potential amount available to lose becomes less and less over time.
When 1BTC = $1 ; you might be making transactions in the 1-100BTC range regularly; which means you could lose 1-100BTC in a poorly crafted transaction; or you might lose your stash of 10,000 BTC due to poor backup procedure. 
When 1 BTC = $1M USD most of your transactions are going to be 100 - 100,000 Satoshi's (0.0000001-0.00001BTC); meaning far less coins could potentially be lost. As bitcoin becomes more valuable people will lose them far less.

A lot of people seem to think 1Mb blocks means that you only need to be able to download 1Mb per 10minutes for your node to keep up. 
A node is connected to dozens if not hundreds of peers which are constantly sharing/seeding transactions and blocks. 
In many parts of the developed world where there are datacaps; running a fullnode can already eat a significant part of your monthly bandwidth allowance.
How many node operators are going to buy extra bandwidth to run their node? Some will, but many will not, unless it is somehow incentivized economically.
As the cost of running a node increases, and the benefit stays the same; less people will run nodes.
If only there was a solution that allowed nodes to be financially incentivized for their valuable contributions to the network.

Publish information directly to the blockchain that can only be decrypted with the correct hash of private key + balance. Destroy or never create unencrypted copies.
Send payment to the private key, get the generated hash which is the encryption key to access the blockchain data.
Publish the data in such a way that it can be decrypted by a large number of keys that can be generated procedurally so that payment addresses can be generated for each unique sale. Kind of like HD wallets contain a large subset of all keys but all derived from the same seed.
If information is created from the beginning in a manner such as this it could destroy the ability to access information without the transfer of value.

Although in theory it is possible; in practice it would be very difficult for a government or corporation to secretly amass the hashing power necessary to launch an attack on Bitcoin. Even if they did so; the community could hard-fork around an obvious attack which while it would be damaging to Bitcoin; would allow Bitcoin to route around the attackers; making their investment completely worthless.
Then you get into some other less predictable factors. If someone were to discover a method of hashing which was revolutionarily faster than current methods; they could make an enormous amount of money by mining Bitcoin. So potential attackers would need to spend massive amounts funding hashing/electronics engineers and researchers to develop these methodologies in secret. Of course they would have to hope that other engineers/researchers already working in this $17Billion industry do not hit on the same advances or better advances. 
While it is possible for Bitcoin to be overtaken; it is in practice very difficult. Bitcoin can route around attacks, and Bitcoin incentivizes its own security. 
It would take an enormous investment just to attempt to take over the network; and if that attempt were to fail it would cause the confidence of Bitcoin to soar to such massive heights. A state actor attacking Bitcoin is a huge gamble for them; no guarantee it will work; and if it fails not only have they lost their investment; they will cause Bitcoin to be emboldened.
A direct attack on Bitcoin is unlikely; more likely that they would try to bribe pool operators or manipulate the spot price. 
They could buy enormous amounts of Bitcoin and push the price way up beyond sustainable levels; sustaining it themselves for a year or more; letting miners build up huge farms; and then selling it all for a huge loss to try to crash the market and cause mining to fail. Again this would be risky, and the market has already proven to be able to handle massive spikes and crashes.
Governments around the world could all work together to ban Bitcoin miners and nodes; but that is just not realistic. Governments rarely ever agree on such things; and you would literally need nearly 100% to agree to actually exterminate Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is what they call "Anti-Fragile" ; when you try to break it, and it survives, it grows stronger.

Bitcoin cannot be truly destroyed without a global catastrophe that wipes out pretty much all electricity on the planet.
There are many things which could cause the value of Bitcoin to decrease; but it is nearly impossible for Bitcoin to be completely destroyed.
Dev's in prison would do very little
Outlawing would need to be done in-sync globally; or else the nations that continue to allow it will allow it to prosper even more.
In my opinion the way to hurt Bitcoin the most would be to buy an enormous amount and artificially sustain the price at ridiculous levels; get mining difficulty insanely high; and then unload your coins. If the market crashes enough miners will be unprofitable and shut down; causing blocks to not be processed.
However it would be possible in such an emergency scenario to hard-fork Bitcoin to lower the difficulty. So an attack like this would cost billions and there is no guarantee Bitcoin wouldn't just route around it.

It is the same with Onecoin; to anybody with half a brain it is an obvious logical non-sequitur. The value of cryptocurrency is in a decentralized blockchain secured by miners competing for coinbase rewards.
OneCoin is literally just an oldschool ledger. You send them money; they pen in a number on a ledger that says "OneCoin"; there are no nodes; there are no miners; there is no Blockchain.

Your biggest security risk is that you implied you put all your coins on a single paper wallet. Its not a huge risk, but the more value you store in a single place, the more attention it will gather and therefore more attempts to steal it.
Also in the event Bitcoin increases in value 10000x, importing your private key will become an important security event. Someone could steal your laptop or PC the moment you import the decrypted key.
If you were to split it up into denominations so that you only needed to import small chunks at a time, this would mitigate the risk.

I'll have to look into this. When I was doing a lot of thinking about how to turn bitcoin into cash like units that can be exchanged with little trust I kept coming back to the concept of using a 2nd blockchain to record a GPS log.
Essentially each "paper" wallet would be a small piece of hardware with a GPS unit and the public key. The private key being stored in such a way that the GPS would have to be destroyed in order to retrieve it.
The GPS logs coordinates into a blockchain, a blockchain explorer allows you to view the movement of the paper wallet from the moment of its creation to you.
If the GPS unit is tampered with the log will display a "VOID" on the blockchain. At that point one will have to sweep the private key into another wallet to keep using the funds.
I suppose the GPS would have to be hardened so that people couldn't spoof it out.

Satoshi mined a million or so coins; and it is debated whether or not the keys are lost or he/she/them are dead. I wouldn't assume they are lost.
There are a great number of Bitcoins that are lost; due to loss of private keys, but that number is uknowable; and as Bitcoins price increases those lost keys may be recovered through expensive recovery operations that only make sense at an extremely high price of Bitcoin.
For instance someone threw out a harddrive with 10,000 BTC or so on it. It is at a landfill somewhere. It is worth about 10M USD now; probably not worth going through the whole landfill for it. But if BTC reaches 1M; that HDD will be worth $10Billion and excavating an old landfill may be profitable at that point.

If there were no risk the potential ceiling wouldn't be so high.
I use Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is finding "riskless" use cases, but for most people using Bitcoin costs more time or money than using Bank Money. 
People will only go through the trouble of buying Bitcoin if they see a potential benefit for them, a major potential benefit is valuation increase.
Bitcoin is starting to make breakthroughs in remittances, people will buy and use Bitcoin where it makes their lives easier and saves them money, or has the potential to make them money.
For "regular" people there is still little reason to use Bitcoin other than its potential for valuation increase or for political reasons.

It would cause the price to skyrocket during the runup, which could be the catalyst for hyper-bitcoinization where everyone panic buys in mass, ensuring that Dimon would only get a fraction of the coins. They would have to amass a large enough fraction to incite a panic sell, but the demand may already be too high at that point.
Thats the hard part, they have to buy slowly over long periods of time in order to not cause a price rise, then dump a lot in short period of time to try to cause the price to crash.

For a couple reasons:
1) These Bankchains will not even try to compete with a mathematically defined, finite, permissionless asset token. Their token creation process will not involve public mining, but authenticated (privileged) keys that allow coin generation. In this sense they are simply not competing with the Bitcoin network or currency.
2) Bitcoin transactions are secured by the underlying value of Bitcoin itself. These bankchains, without an asset token of independent value do nothing ground breaking. They are simply transfering IOU's. When you transfer Bitcoin you are actually transfering value, not a proxy of value. As people start figuring this out they will end up anchoring their bankchain to the public Bitcoin Blockchain.
3) For years the Bitcoin technology has been derided and ridiculed, and now suddenly Banks and Governments have accepted that Bitcoin has created revolutionary technology and are trying to adopt it. This in many peoples eyes (who can't evaluate things for themselves) validates what many people in the Bitcoin space have believed about this technology for years.

Its can be either or both. But in Bitcoin it is usually an increase in supply that causes 20-40% losses. Big sustained sell orders that sell into the order books over periods of hours or days then triggers panic sellers who depress the price further. Then when the price bottoms out or reaches a predetermined point; those who sold to initiate the panic buy back in; and the price climb resumes.
Demand usually evaporates when the price starts going sour; and price goes sour from increased supply. That is what we saw in 2013-2014. Long sustained dump over months reduced demand and caused the market to bottom around $200.

That would seem to imply that they believe the inflation subsidy would need to be replaced by something else or go on indefinitely. Obviously indefinite inflation subsidy would destroy Bitcoin.
Am I the only one who see's the "high" fee's as a good thing? Miners are more and more dependent upon transaction processing rather than inflation subsidy. It was always a question of how the miners would survive as the halvings reduce their rewards. I think this bodes well for the long term sustainability of Bitcoin.

A soft fork that requires 95% miner consensus to activate;
A hard fork that requires 75% miner consensus
A hardfork with only 75% consensus is bound to have catastrophic effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem and destroy any network effect we've built up. Wallets, nodes, exchanges all must upgrade to avoid losing funds. And with 25% still mining on the other chain there will be considerable question which chain they should be on.
A softfork with 95% consensus is much safer; wallets, nodes, exchanges will all be able to operate even if they do not upgrade. They can upgrade slowly over time or not at all.
With a hardfork people are forced to upgrade or risk getting left on the wrong network. The fact that people will be forced into making this choice will introduce uncertainty; and that uncertainty will set Bitcoin back by years.
A non-emergency hardfork sets a very bad precedent. If Bitcoin is easy to "upgrade" via hardfork, that means it is easy to change critical protocol features like the 21Million coin limit. We must reserve hardforks for existential Bitcoin crises. If SegWit, Lightening, and other solutions cannot provide scaling, then our transaction bottleneck may represent an existential crisis; but not yet.

SegWit will vastly increase the money coming in to miners. Lightening networks will increase the transaction rates by orders of magnitude.
If we are doing 1000 TPS at an average of $0.05/transaction and 50% goes to nodes and 50% to miners; that would give miners $15,000 per block in fee's and nodes $15,000 per block in fee's. 
The miners do not want to lose their source of revenue by forking to a worthless coin. They will either adopt segwit or not adopt segwit; but they certainly won't get 75% of the hashpower to fork.

There are many reasons that people would pay a premium for Bitcoin through Purse.
For instance many people work microjobs for Amazon gift card points; but if Amazon doesn't ship to their country; or the products they need are not offered they must convert it to a local currency. In some cases Bitcoin provides the quickest/cheapest conversion.
Other people receive amazon gift card points for Credit card rewards. They may be willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin.
It wouldn't surprise me if some carding is going on, however, Purse has increased their anti-carding measures over the years.

Biological Immortality will never happen. What is so important about preserving your biology? We will never be able to re-engineer 4billion years of evolution to rid ourselves of biological death. 
We can however transcend death in other, more meaningful ways.
When we write, our thoughts are preserved, when others read these thoughts we live in their brains. Our thoughts become their thoughts.
I think most people want to preserve the "experiencer" indefinitely when they talk about immortality. I see no reason for the felt experience to be exclusive to biology. I would much rather upload a copy of myself.
I'd then proceed to make as many copies of myself and stream the data out into space, hopefully picked up on alien worlds I can be resurrected throughout the cosmos.
I'll build "experiential" probes with my consciousness pattern that travel out into interstellar space. Each probe streams all the data to every other probe, creating a massive meshwork of consciousness that spans lightyears.
The body is so limited, I'd rather become transcendentally illuminated, an immortal being spread throughout the universe, with nearly limitless experiencial modes and computational abilities.

They will not even try to compete with Bitcoin. They will create a currency that is defined by a political process rather than mathematical. They will not allow permissionless transactions.
They are simply creating an expensive distributed ledger. It may be an improvement over the way banking is currently done, but does not compete with Bitcoin.
If they do create a permissionless, mathematically controlled currency I'd buy some, but I'd imagine that will be a cold day in Hell.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:04:56
Yes, Bitcoin is rising in popularity so fast that transaction space is becoming limited. Bitcoin already has a system for prioritizing transactions inside of it's blocks. You can send bitcoin transactions for free, and if there is free space available your transaction will be included for free. If there is no free space available your transaction will be returned after 48hours. If you don't want to wait you simply send a small fee with your transaction, usually $0.001 to $0.03 depending on network usage at the time, and your transaction will be included in the next 10 minutes. If you send too small of a fee and want your transaction processed sooner you can "re-send" the transaction with a higher fee and it will replace the lower fee transaction.
The idea that Bitcoin is dying because it is so popular is absurd.
Credit Card transactions take 90 days to settle. Ninety Days. Three months. During this time period transactions can be reversed. CC transactions cost $0.03 + 1-3% (depending on merchant). You don't see these fee's but the merchant passes them on to you.
Bitcoin transactions take 10-30minutes to settle. After confirmation there is no possibility of transaction reversal. Bitcoin is the SETTLEMENT layer.

I've used one to get me started, largely because it was easily accessible and didn't require me to link a bank account and multiple-day verification. 
The Bitcoin ATM (or Bit vending machine as I like to call it) was a convenient way to get a small amount of Bitcoin to experiment with.
Since it was as simple as inserting cash and providing a payment address I didn't feel the need to purchase a large amount. I could experiment with $1, $5, $20, etc until I felt comfortable.
After playing around with the BVM (bitvending machine) and getting my first few Satoshi's, I felt comfortable enough to sign up with Coinbase.
I rarely purchase from the BVM anymore, but it is located in a restaurant that accepts BTC at a 10% discount, so when I eat there I top off from the BVM.
I was curious about the sucess of the BVM, so I kept track of the address the BVM paid out from. Interestingly this one was integrated with Bitstamp and always sent BTC from the same address. 
After 2 years it turns out very little was purchased from this machine. It could be the location of the machine or the fact that it was down about 50% of the time I tried to use it.
I'm extremely happy that BVM's exist, but I'm not sure how they can be profitable at all.
With all the identification requirements in some areas and the premium people would pay from a BVM, I'm not sure how they can survive in the current ecosystem.

Since there is more held up than the object being traded is worth, and the amounts owed to each party are equal, each party has a large and equal incentive to come to a compromise on their own when a dispute arises. Both parties win during compromise, both parties lose equally if they fail to compromise.
It requires 4x the amount at minimum simply to counterbalance the incentives. Less than that amount and the buyer or seller would have the advantage when it came to signing the transaction "Well this transaction would cost me 100BTC, but if I dont sign it would cost you 200 BTC, so I'm not going to sign unless you give me an extra 20 BTC, I can afford to lose 100, can you lose 200?"
Say the seller never ships the widget. They've got 1 BTC locked up, the buyer has 3 BTC locked up. The seller loses 1 BTC if she/he fails to ship and loses reputation. The buyer loses 3 BTC. I just can't really imagine a scenario where someone could work this into a scam, but maybe it can be. Why would the seller throw away 1BTC if they never intend to ship? Just to make the buyer throw away 3BTC? I suppose the seller could attempt to extort the buyer, but if that fails the extortionist could be out a lot of money with no chance of recourse. This would also tarnish any reputation the seller might have. Though I suppose if there is a need for reputation that is a kind of trust.
The buyer upon receipt has large incentive to release the funds.

PoW should be changed as soon as possible. Jihan has the hashpower to fork at any time. Bitcoin now only exists because we trust the benevolence of  a single large miner. Bitcoin can only continue truly being Bitcoin by changing PoW. Right now we simply have to trust that Bitmain wont fork or do anything malicious.
Even if Bitmain changed their position; we would still have to trust them.
We must change PoW. We need to plan an emergency rollout ASAP. Bitcoins network is not trustless right now. When people realize this the value will evaporate quickly. PoW change is required ASAP or say goodbye to Bitcoin.

Precisely, we are often fooled by our own pattern seeking behavior.
That doesn't mean there aren't patterns out there that can be used to improve your life, but it does mean that more often than not we will see a pattern that is not there, or as you said, is not causally related.
I think we've both read fooled by randomness and other of Talebs works recently, your words remind me of him. You've probably read them all, but the three part series, fooled by randomness, Black Swans, and Antifragility are quite amazing.

EDIT: If people are actually making financial decisions off the way a chart "looks" they are most likely doing it wrong. One has to determine for oneself based off of principles if an asset is over/under valued.

Make decisions based on what one believes are fundamentals.

The past doesn't predict the future, but patterns sure are intriguing. Particularly since patterns can be linked to human psychology. The universe operates on mathematical laws regardless of human activity or psychology. The universe is an unfolding fractal.
Fractals are both self-similar and contains emergent properties. This is why they are so engrossing. Everything is the same, yet completely different all at once. The universe is just a large number of permutations on a small number of subatomic particles. Different combinations of basic particles varied in space and time produce all the variety of Universe around us.
 With a fractal, even though you cannot predict the future iteration without actually iterating, you know that the future must be created from elements of the past. The future evolves from the past, it seems obvious, but is profound. The future is determined by the past more than we like to believe. There is a cultural momentum that has lasted thousands of years.
Humans are pattern detectors. Our ability to discern patterns where others see none is one of our defining characteristics as a species. Science seeks to understand these patterns methodologically and empirically, Mysticism seeks to understand these patterns from a process and evolutionary perspective. Two sides of the same coin. The job of science is to prove the existence of patterns, and understand their character (how they react to stimuli). The job of the mystic is to synthesize these patterns into a cultural and evolutionary narrative. Neither the Mystics nor the Scientists can answer the question of "why do underlying patterns (laws of the universe) exist"
The scientists job is to determine the bounds of reality empirically.
The mystics job is to synthesize empiric information into a meaningful narrative.
A mystic that ignores the scientific process is a false, ignorant, prophet.
A scientist that ignores the mystical narrative is an autistic robot.

What you are saying is that the security of node decentralization will rely on common users acting altruistically.
If all humans behaved altruistically we would already be living in a global paradise. The reality is well studied and known as "tragedy of the commons"
People will knowingly exploit a good, resource, or service to the point that they destroy their ability to utilize it. They know that if everyone else behaves nicely; they can get away with behaving selfishly. The problem is that everyone feels this way, until the commons are destroyed.
Big Blockers want Bigcoin to be secured by altruistic behavior rather than mutual distrust and properly balanced economic incentives. A total recipe for disaster. I can't wait until BU forks off into irrelevancy.

We should Hard fork to new PoW regardless.
We are at Jihans Mercy. If he wants to fork he can fork the network anytime. Bitcoin is not trustless right now. We should fork to a new PoW now.
It would certainly hurt the price; maybe set it back a year or so. On the other hand it will set an incredible precedent. In the future people will be far less likely to try to 51% attack or even grow their mining operations too large. If they know that Bitcoin will just route around them and make their hardware useless they will be less likely to try to take the network hostage.
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:35:03
It is true though. 
The cost of mining 1 BTC is always approaching the value of 1 BTC.
Miners are spending money on electricity, hardware, warehouse space, salaries, etc. When a miner decides to hold versus sell; they are in essence buying the BTC. It has the same effect on demand as an external actor buying BTC. Miners always sell 100% at market price; either to themselves or to exchanges. Supply increases by 1800 coins a day; and marketcap increases by marketpricex1800. 
Another way to think about it; if it only costs $900 to mine 1 BTC and the market rate is $1000/BTC a miner can make a cool $100 profit by selling. If they choose to not sell at market price; they are saying that they believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. The pass up on a guaranteed amount of money for the prospect of having more money in the future. This is the same psychology behind "buyers" and holders.
So a miner always sells 100% at market price; either to themselves or an exchange.

I disagree.
If BU fork with majority hashrate we then have to trust BU miners to behave nicely and not attack Bitcoin. The uncertainty that this will create will never go away until one or the other dies off. This uncertainty will be devastating to the price; potentially to the point that the network itself dies. Bitcoin would no longer to trustless, it would exist due to the benevolence of BU miners; that isn't a currency I'm interested in.
If BU gains majority hashrate and forks, the only possibility for Bitcoin to survive is to change PoW.

If BU forks Bitcoin Core is dead in the water without a PoW change.
It literally will not affect miners at all.
The options are:

2)BU Forks with majority hashrate and Bitcoin Core forks to new PoW. All Sha256 miners now can only mine BU (and some alts)

But different institutions have different access to resources and therefore have different requirements when it comes to trust.
For instance Coinbase may decide they can trust 0-confirm transactions because they believe they have the resources to use the legal system to force participants to play by the rules.
Other institutions that don't have those resources may be at higher risk accepting 0 confirmation transactions and therefore should not accept them.
Institutions may have access to other databases of information that allow them to use a decision matrix to help determine if and how many confirmations need to be made before accepting the transaction.
Coinbase's response to the issue may very well be to flex the legal system rather than change their product offering.

I suppose that is up to each individual to decide for themselves.
For me an emergency would be some kind of unknown bug that causes people to lose funds, cause coins to be created or destroyed, blocks not be generated.
I'd love for Bitcoin to be able to process VISA level transaction rates AND to be anti-fragile. As computing power increases the cost of running a node will decrease, which increases decentralization over time. If we rely on continually advancing technology we are by definition fragile to the possibility that technology advancement slows way down. We may become more centralized, less centralized, or stay the same. If we code for anticipations of future technology growth we introduce uncertainty.  We have enjoyed unprecedented growth in technology for decades, there is no guarantee it will continue growing. A soft fork could be introduced at a future point in time, but in my opinion, ideally we want to build this ship and set it a-sail. In the future I think it would be beneficial for the Bitcoin protocol to be relatively immutable, resistant to any change, save for emergencies. The sheer size of the network and difficulty of establishing network effects will prevent anything but emergency changes from being adopted.
What happens if this coming financial shock causes semiconductor industry to go out of business? What if tech investments slow or halt? Trying to code increases for the future introduces uncertainty, and fragility dependent upon our vision of the future being true.

Some people may agree with that but many would not. 
Bitcoin is more than about the most sha256sha256 hashes. For instance if somehow an organization gained majority hashrate that forked Bitcoin to have more than 21million coins; would that still be Bitcoin just because it has the majority hashrate? Some people might say yes; but many would not.
Some people define Bitcoin by the majority of hashes; some people define it by a philosophy embodied by the core protocol.

I don't consider the money I invested to be "real" for another few years.
When I first started investing in Bitcoin I watched as my investment fell 70%; thankfully I had studied its price history and was very well aware of this possibility. It was money I could afford to lose and at one point it was basically lost; and I was fine. I started exchanging my money for Bitcoin not explicitly for profit; but because I felt (and feel) that Bitcoin is humanities best hope for a sustainable future. Money is power. Printing a one billion dollar fed note costs the same as printing a one dollar bill. Mining 1million Bitcoins takes at least 1million times the power to mine 1 Bitcoin. Having a money that is both limited by code and physical resources will force a revaluation of global systems and force sustainability. Governments and banks will not be able to fund non-sustainable wars and other programs by simply printing money. Or make non-sustainable programs look sustainable.
I have a much greater anxiety of a global economic depression and funding imperialistic wars than Bitcoin market crashes and hardforks. 
If a hardfork comes along I'm not selling either chain; I'll gladly take double the coins and see what evolves months/years down the line.

The words aren't wrong; we just disagree with each other.
Bitcoin is open-source you are right. For the same reason people are free to run BU and call it Bitcoin; people are free to change the PoW and call it Bitcoin. In time the market will value one; the other; or possibly both.
Hashpower certainly is an important part of the ecosystem but it is obviously nothing without users. It doesn't matter how many hashes you throw at a blockchain nobody uses. 
Hashpower gives miners the ability to produce blocks. That is all. If the users nodes, wallets, and services determine that a block is invalid they do not have to accept it. Bitcoin is a decentralized system and the miners absolutely do not have all the power. 
Even if all miners, nodes, wallets, and services agreed to a change; if the economic supermajority does not agree to the change the change may not occur without a large financial burden.
Power in Bitcoin is distributed among Miners, Nodes, Wallets, Exchanges, Services, Holders, and Users.
The only thing Miners do is create blocks. They are the most heavily subsidized part of the network already. We shouldn't be unbalancing the incentive system even more in their favor.
Segwit helps rebalance by giving nodes an opportunity to be incentivized through Lightning transactions.

In a free market people will still seek retribution for violation of contracts. Do you suggest these people create a highly illegal (and probably immoral) private retribution system rather than utilize the legal framework?
Obviously it would be ideal for people to do their due-diligence and not have their money stolen in the first place. However people will have their money stolen and won't do their due-diligence, and these same people will want justice. Some kind of dispute mediation system is necessary to prevent violence and since I'm not aware of a well functioning dispute mediation system that can bound its participants (outside the State legal system) it just seems natural that these people will pay private attorneys to leverage the legal system for justice.

PoW change is the only way to keep Bitcoin alive if BU Forks with majority hashrate.

Why should it matter if PoW is changed on Bitcoin?
They can still use their hardware to mine BU. BU isn't changing the PoW. If Core loses majority hash power then it wouldn't be responsible to continue mining with the same PoW as BU miners would be able to attack the Core chain.
If BU actually forks; Core should absolutely fork PoW. It would be irresponsible otherwise. Not forking PoW would be inviting attacks. If PoW is not changed; Core miners and nodes might as well just shut down because they will not be secure.

For a long time I have waivered back and forth between the blocksize/hardfork debate. 
I do believe I have settled my mind on the issue.
Listening to Jamie Dimon speak about governments attempt to shut Bitcoin down "if it gets too big" reminded me really what it is we are up against. 
Bitcoin seeks to displace centuries old power structures, and they certainly won't go without a fight. We've been ignored up to this point, but now financial institutions and governments are taking notice.
Bitcoin must remain as decentralized and censorship resistant as possible. If we create a situation where nodes and miners have no possibility of operating anonymously, then they could theoretically all be targeted. Increasing centralization decreases the targets.
If for some reason major governments, the US, Russia, China, and the EU decided to outlaw bitcoin and/or create onerous regulations, a highly decentralized network would be able to adapt. 
People would be able to mine behind TOR and VPN, people in South America and even some places in Africa could keep mining on.
Jamie Dimon makes it clear that he will use his influence to try to crush Bitcoin if it becomes a threat to his empire. I want Bitcoin to be as resilient as possible to any and all of these threats.
Additionally, a hardfork without a true state of emergency demonstrates that this currency and network can be changed by the will of the majority. We do not want a currency and network controlled by a political process. Yes the Core maintainers are a small group, but Bitcoin will grow beyond Core development. As the ecosystem grows, it will become more and more difficult to make any changes that are not absolutely necessary. This is a great property of Bitcoin, to be absolutely resistant to change. It inspires confidence that other parameters won't be changed in the future.
Another point I want to bring up is the halving we will experience later this year. We all want to believe that the price will increase significantly in response to the halving. This is far from guaranteed. A rising fee market will help subsidize miners during what WILL be an incredibly volatile year.
We, as the Bitcoin community have created something the world has never seen before. Bitcoin is worthless if we make it fragile enough to be ruined by State sanctions. Bitcoin is invaluable to me because it is anti-fragile.
I support the Core maintainers Roadmap.

Precisely why we need a PoW change.
Bitcoin miners must understand their place in the ecosystem. It is time to change the PoW and reset the mining arms race.
With so many more people involved now compared to 2009; mining will likely be a lot more decentralized. We can utilize a rotating PoW and make it very difficult to develop ASICs. Additionally; if we fork around this 51% attack it will seriously deter any miner from attempting this in the future.
Forking to a new PoW seems like the best path forward at this point. Regardless of whether BU forks or not; PoW on the core chain must be changed. The miners and users clearly have differing philosophy and non-aligned incentives.

In my opinion Gavin Warrant Canaried himself with the whole Craig Wright debacle.
Gavin is a smart guy; a very smart guy. Somebody that Satoshi trusted to hand the Bitcoin project over to.
Yet an obvious Satoshi imposter was able to "trick" Gavin without providing the slightest bit of cryptographic evidence.
In my opinion Gavin did this to remove himself from a position of authority in Bitcoin. I further speculate that he wanted to distance his authority over Bitcoin because he may be under duress or in some way under the control of intelligence agencies. So instead of telling the CIA to fuck off and risking his life; he destroys his own credibility so that people are more likely to scrutinize the opinions and code that he may be being forced to produce.
Obviously this is all entirely speculation; not a shred of evidence as far as I am aware.

It would follow from the logic I was using that a lower limit would be even safer/more resilient. 
There is obviously a sweet spot. If we take it to the extreme, the most resilient network would have blocks large enough for a single transaction every 10 minutes.  
We know that 1mb works by historical accident, why reduce it if it works well at this level? It's low enough to prevent DOS and high enough to provide 2000 transactions per 10minutes. It might not be the ideal, but it works and trying to change it at the protocol level would just increase the fighting here.

Yeah the halving is going to be a very volatile time indeed.
Though if the price does spike up before the halving hopefully miners are able to cash in on that extra profit and use that cash to help buffer costs after the halving.

The only value in high hashrates is that it theoretically protects you from a 51% attack. When mining is centralized so much that a single pool owner can make a credible threat of a 51% attack there is absolutely no value to having such a high hashrate.
Right now with centralized mining, the value of Bitcoin is hovering close to $0; and I say that as someone with probably too much skin in the game. 
What value does Bitcoin have? It is private, trustless, deflationary; among many other reasons. 
But now Bitcoin requires trust. We have to trust Jihan to keep the 21M coin limit; he can change that at any time. We have to trust Jihan to not censor transactions. 
So what we have right now is JihanCoin. Whatever Jihan wants he gets. We simply have to trust that he plays nicely. 
How is that better than the Federal Reserve system? There is no security of the Blockchain currently.

I'm not sure exactly how obvious it would be since I haven't seen anyone else suggest this. What would have gotten him killed would be publicly saying something like "The CIA wants to use me to gain control over Bitcoin" 
It just simply does not make sense that Gavin would vouch for Craig without Cryptographic evidence. Gavin who was the "chief scientist" of the worlds first and dominant CRYPTO-currency built on mutual distrust of all parties, secured by cryptography; accepted the identity of a prominent individual without any cryptographic evidence. 
Gavin is smarter than that; or was smarter than that. I just don't buy it that a guy at the center of the development of Bitcoin; who was in previous contact with Satoshi; was more easily "bamboozled" than the majority of individuals comprising the Bitcoin community. 
The more I think about it, the more I believe that Gavin intentionally destroyed his credibility with the Craig Wright debacle. For what reason I can only speculate. Maybe he just doesn't want the responsibility of people looking towards him as a source of authority.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:03:57
For many reasons. The first is the assumption that the majority hashrate represents anything of tangible value.
Hashes are absolutely worthless on their own. I can create a hash function and generate 100% of all the hashes on it. That means absolutely nothing.
The only value high hashrate has is when it is well decentralized. A single miner producing 75% of the hashes is the opposite of security.
We might as well get rid of mining entirely and just ask that Jihan craft the blocks however he feels fit. He can choose which transactions to include; he can choose how many coins to reward to himself; he can choose not to include any transactions at all. 
The difficulty and the hashrate mean nothing if it is centralized. There is literally zero reason to use a cryptocurrency when you have to trust a single individual wont fuck it up. 
Right now the value of Bitcoin is hovering around $0. Bitcoin has value because it is trustless. But now we have to trust Jihan. How is this better than the FED? It is not. We must change the PoW ASAP to bring value back to Bitcoin before investors wake up and drive the price to $0.

I think we just have different approach. Adoption for me, is not more important than maintaining the robustness of the network. 
I also don't agree that adoption will necessarily be hampered by small blocks, I just think the way people use it will be different. 
I think of Bitcoin like digital gold. I'm not sure how long and how much it costs to transport $400million of physical gold internationally in 2000 discrete shipments, but I'm going to guess it costs more than $200 and takes longer than 10minutes. (Block  I'm not saying it should be expensive, but we have created a hard bearer asset that can be securely transferred electronically between individuals without a banking intermediary. An asset that can be stored in a distributed manner to help mitigate physical coercion and extortion.
All of these properties are more important to me than widespread adoption. 
I don't necessarily think 2mb is bad, but I do think that Core is taking the safest approach.

The only point I'd disagree with is:


I believe Bitcoin has achieved something that is truly unique in the history of our species. We have created a unit of value detached from violence, and a network to transact those units permissionlessly, and trustlessly, and if desired, anonymously. 
I'd like to have an anti-fragile network and large blocks; but if I had to choose I would choose I would take anti-fragility over large blocks.
I do like to entertain the idea that as we increase our userbase, the node count will increase, however, I don't think it is a linear correlation between new users and node operators.
Consider that Bitcoin has existed for 7 years, and many techy, DIY type people got involved relatively early on. I think it is a reasonable assumption that as time goes on and Bitcoin attracts more and more mainstream type users and usages, the percentage of new users who create a new node will be far less than it is today. A combination of cost, disinterest, and lack of technical ability will prevent new users from running their own full node.
I guess what I am trying it say is that by raising the cost of running a node we threaten to take out an unknown number of nodes, and I don't think the demographics of new users who haven't participated in Bitcoin in the past 7 years will have as much skill or interest to run a node as the current userbase.

As generating your own power is not profitable, why do more and more power plants keep opening?
Consider an entrepreneur in the energy industry. They can generate electricity and profit. They can incorporate a mining farm, and can switch it on/off depending on electricity prices. When the demand for electricity is low, the consumer cost falls, there is a loss when storing electricity rather than using it. Power plants can sell their excess electricity to the bitcoin network during low demand to subsidize their profits. In this way powerplants can keep themselves at peak usage 100% of the time. Either energy is being used by consumers or being used by the Bitcoin network.
Though I suppose it might be a little interesting if the price of Bitcoin skyrockets and powerplants decide it is more profitable to mine bitcoin than provide power to consumers.
Mining is profitable, but extreme competition means you must be very resourceful and cunning to compete effectively.

If we hardfork to a new PoW it would set a precedent that would make 51% attacks far less likely in the future.
If Bitcoin hardforks to a new PoW and survives it will demonstrate its resillience to large attacks and willingness to fight them off. Who in their right mind would try to 51% attack if they know that Bitcoin can and has routed right around them?
A PoW change would be progress for Bitcoin, not a step back. Bitcoin was far more decentralized in 2010-2012 than it is now. Literally a handful of people have the ability to pull off a 51% attack right now; this wasn't the case a few years ago.
Changing the PoW would be a huge step forward. It might be costly in the short term, but would pave the way in the long run for Bitcoins success.

I agree that we need better ways to numerically describe "decentralization" because you bring up a very valid point. A single entity running 1000 nodes doesn't increase decentralization of the network meaningfully, unless they do so in a way they don't have control over the nodes. 
I think its more important to have many individual node operators rather than a few operators running many nodes.

True, but we also must consider that mining does create a downward pressure on the price to the tune of 3600*630; $2.3M USD per day.
Simply to maintain whatever price Bitcoin is at, 3600 must be sold at the current market price every day.
That will be reduced to 1800 everyday.
There will be less downward pressure on the price after the halving.
If we assume when the price is stable that newly minted supply = new demand, then it follows that if the newly minted supply is cut in half and the demand stays the same, the price will have to rise to reach a new equilibrium.
Obviously this is based on a number of assumptions. Demand may not be matching supply currently, it could be manipulated to look that way. There could also be a lot more demand than it looks like if major actors are shorting to get a better price.

Bitcoin to me is Digital Gold.
It can be encrypted for safe keeping
It can be sent anywhere in the world and settled in 10mins
Transactions cannot be revoked by authority
The most important, it is finite, no authority or government can inflate it.
Does Gold need to be able to process tens of thousands of transactions a second to become successful? 
Bitcoin has the properties of gold that make it valuable, AND it has a revolutionary transaction network, AND the worlds first immutable ledger.
These are the most important properties of Bitcoin to me and I'm glad that consensus as far as protocol adoptions seems aligned with protecting or enhancing these properties.

Big money moves ahead of news
Small money moves after news
Bitcoin is not well known, and very few people consider it a safe haven asset (even though it has demonstrated these qualities for several years).
It is difficult to understand and purchasing can require several days of verification.
If you follow "financial news" you'll often see "journalists" say "DOW down 100 points after jobs report" or "DOW up 100 points on leaked earning data"
What is really entertaining is watching the news reports on volatile days. You'll get a news report in the morning when the market is up saying "Market up 3% after positive earnings report" and then in the afternoon "Market falls 2% while OPEC uncertainties loom"
And if you notice very carefully, they never say definitively that it is up or down BECAUSE of these factors, just that they occur at the same time.
The market moves along a stochastic walk, and sometimes that walk crosses certain margin thresholds which activate certain behaviors, which in turn causes large players to make large decisions.
The news is correlative at best, and big money moves ahead of the news.
Why did the stock market rally the day before Brexit? It got within 100 of the right shoulder for the 18month trend, just to be slapped down. It was a final opportunity to get out of the market ahead before the big crash. Big money pumped the market up, and big money cashed out. The market didn't fall on Friday because a bunch of mom and pops with a couple stocks sold, it fell because giant institutions sold. Monday is when we will start seeing some reprecussions. If the market doesn't do a 180 we are looking at banks going under and an entire global game of dominoes coming to a close.
Bitcoin will continue being bitcoin. Sure I'd love it if it were higher, and I dream about it regularly, but as it stands right now at $650, I couldn't be more pleased to be involved in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin represents much more than a vehicle to wealth, it is the most powerful weapon against the modern nation-state, and the most powerful peacemaker on Earth. Bitcoin is far more powerful than any bomb, nuclear or otherwise. No traditional weapon has the potential to cause every nation to fall to its knees without bloodshed.

I have provided data to support my argument and at the same time not a single person that disagreed has been able to cite a single source. The one person who did; their source corroborated my claim and you can see that in the comments. 
Your analogy is obviously biased as it is well known that the number of programming jobs has increased significantly since 1994; but it is not well known whether health-care outcomes have improved. It is generally assumed that outcomes have improved, but it is also assumed that illicit drugs cause more harm to society than prescription medications. These assumptions are not the null hypothesis.

That is a reasonable position. Though I believe that the immutable ledger will create new "uses" for Bitcoin beyond delayed barter. The ability to prove something happened at a certain point in time. Like including the hash of digital goods or hash of patent filings in OP_RETURN. 
I eventually see blockchain space as being incredibly valuable, costing upwards of $10/ on chain transaction. Most commerce will take place on a 2nd layer, and collated efficiently to settle on the blockchain at regular intervals to save money. Ledger space itself will be valuable for recording valuable information and proving a record of ownership.

They insisted on referencing Bitcoin in the past tense, something that used to be and is no more. They didn't explain the significance of "upgrading" a system through hardforks. They didn't discuss the significance of the fact that Bitcoin is now dealing with real money, $10B, and changes to the protocol that have unintended consequences can cause massive losses. They decided not to mention that despite this "Dilemma" Bitcoin has enjoyed a massive bull run, an indication that the market agrees with the current framework.

As a customer when you have the option of paying with fiat credit or Bitcoin, what is the most "rational" choice, assuming zero loyalty to Bitcoin or fiat?
With Fiatcredit the buyer gets insurance, if the product or service isnt as described or isn't received the bank can reverse the charge. Spending fiatcredit generates a small kickback for the user via rewards points; and spending fiatcredit builds credit score that enables a user to get access to more fiatcredit in the future.
As a user when you pay with Bitcoin you do not have any protections. If the merchant is untrustworthy they can take your Bitcoin and run. In addition you are required to calculate your tax liability (if any) every time you spend your Bitcoin.
As a Bitcoin advocate, long time user, and long term Bitcoin saver if I have the choice to pay in fiat or Bitcoin and there is no discount for Bitcoin payment; I will choose to pay in fiat.
I do run a business that accepts Bitcoin, and we offer clients a 20% discount if they pay in Bitcoin up front or a 10% discount if they pay in Bitcoin after services have been rendered. Even with a generous discount I have only received a small handful of Bitcoin payments over the years.

Your coins are safe rest assured.
You didn't pay any fee which is why your transaction is not confirmed.
When Bitcoin was less popular there were few transactions taking place on the network. This meant that there was no need to prioritize the transactions, they could all fit on the network immediately.
As bitcoin has grown in popularity transactions must be properly prioritized to fit on the network. Transactions with the highest fee relative to their size are most valuable to miners, therefore these transactions are confirmed first. All transactions with fee's will confirm before any transactions without fee's (normally).
At this point Bitcoins popularity is at unprecedented levels and shows no signs of slowing down. To transact on the immutable ledge known as the blockchain you must pay a small fee (usually $0.01 to $0.05) to ensure miners will actually include your transaction.
Solutions are being developed that will allow you to transact on various other network layers with less fee's, in exchange for a bit of trust.

They'll end up settling on the Bitcoin Blockchain. If they are smart they'll create CryptoDollars pegged to a timelocked bitcoin transaction. It will be a programmed peg that reduces the amount each Cryptodollar is worth in real time as it is inflated by the banks. This way the banks can still play with your money, but they can be sure they are properly settling up with each other.
The people will never see anything but dollars, pounds, euros, yen, etc in their accounts. But the banks will be using private blockchains that are regularly settled on the Bitcoin network.

I disagree with several of the conclusions. Mining is much more decentralized than it is made to sound. Though mining certainly is the most centralized aspect of Bitcoin, there is still a healthy distribution of hashrate between individuals, corporations, and locales. Compared to any other Cryptocurrency Bitcoin mining is orders of magnitude more decentralized; and this can be observed by number and geographic distribution of pools, not to mention the large % of unknown hashrate that comes from a collection of anonymous entities.
I disagree regarding the centralization of the reference client. The development of the reference "core" client is decentralized; it is the decentralized community that both develops and adopts that software. There are plenty of non core node clients; but the vast majority voluntarily, without formal agreement; choose to run core because it suits their needs or ideals. You addressed this somewhat; but the popularity of the core client is not because its being pushed down from on high; but because Bitcoin users choose to run it.

It's not as simple as increases in computation power; and if we are talking about quantum computing; the practical use of QC for cracking one-way functions is such a far way off that quantum proof cryptography will be implemented well in advance. The whole global infrastructure relies on strong modern cryptography; far more is a stake than Bitcoin if modern cryptography were suddenly broken.
I'm missing your point; if someone finds a key to your safe, thats theft.
If you believe public key cryptography is exploitable there is a hundred billion worth of Bitcoin there for the taking; not to mention all the bank accounts, and every other internet connected system in the world. By all means, exploit it.
I think if you look into the history and mathematics behind the cryptography used in Bitcoin you'll understand why your concerns are quite exaggerated. In my mind the idea of saying that a Bitcoin address collision is possible; is the same as saying the Sun could possibly explode any minute. Its definitely "possible" but so absurdly improbable (and have such wide reaching consequences) that its just not practical to be concerned about.

Because Bitcoin is principally founded on the idea that there are no humans that need to be trusted; only that the network behaves according to protocol rules.

I do find it interesting that the discussion is dominated by rhetoric of egalitarianism vs racism. The concept of financial independence or national sovereignty doesn't seem to be getting much vocalization or airtime.
It is quite obvious that Leaving the EU was always intended. There was no reason to voluntarily call a public vote on such an important matter, other than to be able to shift the blame for the temporary pain to the voters rather than politicians. These politicians are not morons (at least when it comes to manipulating public opinion), though they may play one on TV.
The markets were propped up the day before just to make the fall that much more delicious. 
I don't believe the entire banking world was on board with this decision, which makes sense, considering the UK is declaring their sovereignty from the ECB. Which is why they are being punished with their credit rating being reduced.

Hmm that does sound strange. My experience has always been that when you initiate a buy a little confirmation window will pop up that shows you the amount and the delivery date, and it is on that window that you must confirm the transaction. If that wasn't the case for you, you should contact their support.
If this kind of volatility is difficult for you, I would suggest divesting from Bitcoin. By its nature Bitcoin will be very volatile until/if its price reaches somewhere in the tens of thousands. It could drop down to $250 (or less) or spike up to $5000 (or more) in very short time periods. It is very normal for this kind of volatility to be psychologically straining if you aren't prepared for it.

A little quick to call bullshit?
This is a meta-analysis of 39 other studies; you can read the abstract right here.
To estimate the incidence of serious and fatal adverse drug reactions (ADR) in hospital patients.
**DATA SOURCES:**
Four electronic databases were searched from 1966 to 1996.
**STUDY SELECTION:**
Of 153, we selected 39 prospective studies from US hospitals.
**DATA EXTRACTION:**
Data extracted independently by 2 investigators were analyzed by a random-effects model. To obtain the overall incidence of ADRs in hospitalized patients, we combined the incidence of ADRs occurring while in the hospital plus the incidence of ADRs causing admission to hospital. We excluded errors in drug administration, noncompliance, overdose, drug abuse, therapeutic failures, and possible ADRs. Serious ADRs were defined as those that required hospitalization, were permanently disabling, or resulted in death.
**DATA SYNTHESIS:**
The overall incidence of serious ADRs was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2%-8.2%) and of fatal ADRs was 0.32% (95% CI, 0.23%-0.41%) of hospitalized patients. We estimated that in 1994 overall 2216000 (1721000-2711000) hospitalized patients had serious ADRs and 106000 (76000-137000) had fatal ADRs, making these reactions between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death.
The incidence of serious and fatal ADRs in US hospitals was found to be extremely high. While our results must be viewed with circumspection because of heterogeneity among studies and small biases in the samples, these data nevertheless suggest that ADRs represent an important clinical issue.

Some thoughts I've been kicking around:
It isn't that we want the world economy to crumble. That would be obscene.
It is more that I (and many others) have identified that the way the global economy is run is completely unsustainable.
The sooner this system collapses, the less suffering, starvation, and turmoil. Unfortunately we waited way too long, there is no possibility of a smooth landing. There will be suffering, starvation, and turmoil. The sooner the crash occurs, the sooner we can get humanity back on course. The longer we prolong it, the more likely we make a global starvation event. All our efficiencies and economies of scale are built upon so many spinning plates. The world population is so large that it depends on these efficiencies and economies of scale to survive. The problem is that there is no way to indefinitely maintain these efficiencies and economies of scale with our current global financial backbone. The problem of exponentially increasing interest payments ontop of a debt based currency absolutely garuantees either future defaults or inflation of the currency to pay off debts.
Historically, politicians have chosen to inflate the currency rather than default on loans. This makes sense, inflating the currency doesn't have strong immediate consequences and allows you to kick the can down the road. However in our financial system, the US Government doesn't own the currency, the Federal Reserve does (look at your money, it is a Federal Reserve Note). The US government receives money from the Federal Reserve, and in exchange the Federal Reserve gets Bonds and Securities. The Federal Reserve simply pens the numbers into the US Govt Database, and in return the Federal Reserve receives a promise that the US Govt will pay back the amount borrowed + Interest. So every dollar in existence represents a debt that the US Govt must pay back to Private Banks.
Essentially, we started the Federal Reserve and the Government started becoming indebted. In order to pay this debt, the government borrows more from the federal reserve, which then adds to the principal, and increases interest payments. The more we borrow, the more we owe. But if we don't borrow, we default on our debts and send the economy into turmoil. Right now the Debt to GDP ratio is not so bad, but interest increases at a RATE, an exponential function. The total debt the US has accumulated since 1776 has doubled since 2009. Think about that. The debt we used to finance this country over 200 years, doubled in just 8. At this rate the debt to GDP ratio will become dangerous within just a couple election cycles.
 A review of historical monetary policy demonstrates the failure of fiat banking, over, and over, and over. Just as communism is shown to result in starvation and despotism, fiat banking has proven itself over millenia to fail. They always run into the same problem, default or inflate. And they always inflate.
The bankers even know this, and they are trying to convince themselves that "This time is different" ; there is even a book called "This time is different" which tries to console people that even though we are running our global financial system in ways that have been proven to fail throughout history, that "This time is different."
So it isn't that we want turmoil and collapse. It is that collapse is inevitable. The sooner it occurs, the less suffering. For this reason I truly hope the Brexit Black Swan is the turning point in this global disaster.

Just a few years ago the world scoffed at Bitcoin. They derided fair, trustless, finite money.
Now Central Banks are scrambling and are finally beginning to understand what polymaths have forseen for decades.
The question is, how (practically) will they go about replacing the USD as the global reserve currency with Bitcoin (or their own misguided crypto attempt)? 
I imagine central banks would first in secret, buy up a large sum of Bitcoin, and operate significant mining operations in member countries. Then announce a trade-in program for banks and governments around the world. All coinciding with a global ban on cash. Then that is when true hyperbitcoinization takes place. You still have dollars in your bank account, but behind the scenes it is Bitcoin the banks hold. Don't worry the common man will never be exposed to the upward volatility of Bitcoin.

If you type a valid address to Blockchain.info it will show it; but that doesn't mean the network knows when it was created. If there are no transactions; you are essentially creating the page when you search for an address with 0 transactions.
If the addresses are created properly there will be no way to determine the exact date it was created. You could get some information if it is a multi-sig address since those have only been around since a certain point in time; but you wouldn't be able to determine a date.

Last year it was 5.7Million and now its just under 8Million.
Still a very impressive increase and demonstrates that every year more coins are being held for long term vs traded back and forth.
That means about 9Million "unique" coins have moved in the past year.
Considering there are about 4Million lost coins; that leaves us with a total of less than 14Million coins available for trading.
Of those 14Million available; 9Million traded last year.
So really a lot more coins are actively traded than are held; but the number of held coins is increasing over time.

If I am understanding this correctly this will allow parties who trust each other (who therefore don't need the security provided by miners) to take advantage of centralization benefits while still being grounded by decentralized Bitcoin.
So groups of Banks for instance could decide that they don't like the idea of their transactions being run through pseudonymous miners and use Bitcoin to settle between each other on a sidechain.
I think then my only concern is that we could see a situation where banks or other organizations build their sidechain; but then end up having abuses of trust by one or more parties. It might be some bad publicity since people will confuse abuse of trust of the sidechain with a security flaw in the actual blockchain.

Any good or service that does not directly translate into providing an essential need for survival (food, water, shelter, etc) looks like a ponzi scheme.
The only value anything has is its agreed upon value. A computer has absolutely no intrinsic value, neither does a bar of gold, a sack of diamonds, or an automobile. 
The value of any asset or commodity could be described as a ponzi; it requires a certain investment to increase in price and produce a return for the earlier investors. If money stopped pouring into the stock market, stocks would not hold their price; stocks would fall.

The nodes currently do not have the same economic incentives to upgrade their software as miners do. Miners must keep their hardware running the most efficient software to sustain their operations.
Most nodes are no self-sustaining and are run altruistically. Many may be setup by people who don't check in on them every day.
~2% of nodes are still running Satoshi:0.10 clients;
And only 50% are running 0.13.xx clients
Bitcoin is a consensus based system; it is one of the properties that gives it value. Even if just 5% of the mining hashpower was still mining on the old chain; with 50% of nodes still relaying there would be a chain split. Two chains would absolutely result and it would most likely be devastating for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole.

Yes; Being the Change you Want to see in the world is exactly the same as not voting.
Did Bill Gates protest the governments of the world that we should have PC's in every home and microchips in every device to increase our efficiencies and capabilities? No; he worked to create his vision of reality come to life. Because he and many others were successful at creating hardware that enabled a better way of doing things; it was integrated into the world. Nobody had to protest the government so that computers would be ubiquitous; it happened because men and women worked hard on a vision.
This world is completely different than it was before PC's; the very way we work and engage each other as an entire species has changed.
No war had to take place. No coup. Yet the world has changed.

Bonus points if you can find a way to lock up those inhuman bastards forever. Allowing millions to suffer, directing the actions of the DEA.
The FDA is completely crooked. It costs hundreds of millions to get drugs approved through the FDA; and after it is all said and done; many drugs have very low efficacy; many have to be recalled. Biotech is growing so fast that most Biotech companies are the authority on whatever application they are developing; which means there really isn't anyone at the FDA to competently question their methods or results.
At the end of the day the FDA limits access to life saving drugs. They prevent/hinder progress in the development of drugs. They provide a false sense of security that anything with the FDA label is safe; despite the fact that the majority of people who die from drugs, die from doctor prescribed medication being used in compliance with doctors orders. They direct the DEA to lock up people who dare use non-approved medications.
The FDA is one of the most corrupt organizations that usually gets passed over. The FDA is fucking evil.

You are exactly right that power spikes can happen which the power company needs to be prepared for. This means that they must generate more power at any given point than is actually needed in order to accommodate spikes in demand. If there was a way to utilize this power for Bitcoin miners they could essentially always have customers for their power. The trick would be that they would need a way so that when consumers turned on their power that it would automatically shutdown the Bitcoin miners.
In this way power companies will desire to produce power at maximum rates continuously, since there will be a customer no matter how much power they produce. This will likely be the next major phase of mining as we see a merger of power companies and bitcoin miners.

Unlike you I run my own business and work for a living.
I make money by helping other people make money. Imagine that. Instead of telling people what they can and can't do and how they should do it; I make money by actually DOING.
You on the other hand make money because you produce propaganda for your corrupt government. Your government has money to give to you because they stole it from the population with the threat of violence. And you spend your time trying to convince people that we should be happy having our freedoms restricted; for our own safety. 
You are a pathetic government pawn. You add no value to society; if you did you wouldn't need to be supported by a government who supports you by threatening the citizens of your country.

There is a difference between introducing someone to Bitcoin and trying to "convince" them.
My point is more or less that if a person is argumentative/combative regarding Bitcoin rather than curious that it is a waste of time trying to "convince" them the value of Bitcoin. 
They will mock you; and when the price drops they will "worry" about you; and when the price rises they will loathe you.  
Introduce people to Bitcoin yes; but don't bother convincing the haters. The haters do not deserve to participate in this revolution.

My biggest question is the tax implications. I imagine this counts as a taxable event. If you do last in last out, and buy BTC at market rate and use that to buy goods on Purse discounted at 20% off, isn't that essentially selling your BTC for a 20% gain that you would be liable for capital gains on?
They give you a list of your transactions so it isn't hard to do, but I'm not sure. When you buy goods on black friday for discount with dollars, are you liable for capital gains? It probably has to do with the classification of BTC as an asset. 
Anyways, just something people should be thinking about when making purchases on purse, this is probably a taxable event.

This is 100% expected and honestly I know this is a cliche trope; but a correction like this is good for Bitcoin.
The price has been rising very fast lately and there are people jumping on board who aren't in this for the long term. The people who are looking to cash out at $1500 or $2000 or so for a quick buck rather than be part of the global digital currency revolution. These people will panic sell since they do not have a long term vision. 
People that have been holding for years; that consider it a sunk investment that they will not touch for another decade; they are not likely to respond to these kinds of panics. They are not likely to sell at $2,000 or $10,000 . They will weather the storm until they either NEED the money or they "retire"

I've worked directly with the FDA; developing cellular based assays for Biotech's to prove potency of cellular products as well as investigating mechanisms of action. I left the industry because it's a fucking bullshit game that both the companies and regulators play with each other; with complete disregard to actual patient outcomes. The stated goals of the FDA are admirable; but in reality does little but provide a false sense of security and make it all but impossible to get drugs approved unless there will be billions in profit post-approval; because of the time and cost of the approval process. There are many fruitful avenues of research that are not pursued because the cost of approval is too high. Spinal injuries for instance. There simply aren't enough quadriplegics to make it worth the while to get the treatment approved. But there is plenty of money in prosthesis, wheelchairs, etc. Medical devices aren't quite as costly to get approved.
I have no problem with for-profit pharmaceuticals and biotech; but because the regulatory barriers prevent many treatments from being pursued; and the FDA really doesn't have the brain capital to competently audit cutting edge pharmaceuticals (because all the brain capital is working for them). So it is ineffective, prevents competition, prevents treatments from being pursued, increases the cost of life-saving medication, and then limits access to medication through blatantly unscientific drug scheduling. They are a parasite; they don't know it but they are. Very few people consider themselves evil; I think the people at the FDA truly believe they are helping and have the best intentions. But as they say the road to hell is paved with....

Many people believe that our modern civilization has been built on irresponsibly unstable ground. 
The violence, corruption, greed, hypocrisy, and failure to secure civilizations basic needs in a sustainable way has ensured the collapse of our modern globalized economy.
So after realizing that our global civilization has been marching towards its own destruction, many of us, myself included, couldn't be happier that humans might start acting to reverse this trend. 
If we could actually sustain our society for generations to come, then obviously this would be obscene. The cold hard fact is that the kind of global civilization we have created is impossible to sustain. It must fall sooner or later. The sooner it falls, the less suffering, the less starvation. 
Yes, there will be suffering, there will be starvation. Tragedy of the commons has ensured that we postponed acting until people begin suffering. People don't act on behalf of others suffering, they wait until they feel the pain, and at that point it is too late.
So the global economy crashes now, and maybe we go into WWIII and only lose 75% of the human race.
Or we let globalization play itself out and ensure the destruction of 90-95% of the human race.

Anonymity is a great utility; but I don't see it as the basis of wealth.
The vision of the future I see is where wealth is held as Bitcoin primarily; and then when it is needed Bitcoin is changed into other forms. So you want anonymous transactions; you use Bitcoin to buy an anonymous coin; and then make your transaction with your anon coin; but you only convert what is necessary at the time. 
Bitcoin will be the basis of wealth and other digital assets will form an ecosystem around that basis. Some will of course experience value appreciation; but none will surpass or significantly approach the value that Bitcoin holds.
Of course this is just my vision; everyone has their own; but this is how I foresee things playing out.

I'm not going to debate other apps as payment mechanisms; but I've got to disagree with the statement about transferring "real money"
Those systems transfer nothing but an IOU that eventually settles for bank dollars, usually 90 days later or more. The value of those "bank dollars" being IOU's themselves, "backed" by ~10% of its value in paper notes; which in themselves are really only backed by our collective ability to repay our ever growing debts.
Whereas transacting Bitcoin transfers an asset of free-market determined value; complete settlement of which can take place within an hour.
To me that is much more "real" than an IOU that can be revoked 90 days later.
The only value of fiat is that it can be exchanged for things you actually value. It sounds tautological but its actually an important distinction that USD are ultimately a liability and not an asset, since they are born out of debt.

Simply that you can only consistently make money trading by having certain information about what and when people with large amounts of money are going to do.

There are plenty of reasons you wouldn't want to use highly centralized blockchain tokens as money. I think the system is very interesting; but I do not see it as a competitor to Bitcoin.
When you say about 100million coins; why is that not affirmative? There will never be more than 21million Bitcoins; is there a hard limit to the number of ETH tokens? 
Considering all the forking, and rollbacks, ETH does not compete with Bitcoin for decentralized, trustless money. It may have some uses but I do not see ETH as anything like Bitcoin. I bet that Litecoin and even Dogecoin will be a better store of value than ETH 5 years from now.

My take after watching the Live feed:
Assange is Alive; but he has been compromised.
His explanation was that signing a message would set a precedent that next time their integrity is at stake; that simply signing a message would assuage our fears. This is not true. Signing a message is one part of establishing identity/proof of life. We all know that signing a message just means ownership of a private key; that could mean it was stolen. But if an entity lacks the ability to sign a message with a private key; it lends strong credence to the idea that that entity does not have control of that private key. I would hope someone as important as Assange would memorize a few private keys; so the idea that he simply lost his own keys seems unlikely.
To me the video feed was enough proof that Assange is alive; but the fact that he will not sign a message makes me believe that he has been compromised; and he wants us to know that.

How so? I'm encouraging people to build a parallel civilization rather than fight the existing power structures. 
Not paying taxes would be in my mind fighting the system; which is a waste of time; at least at this stage of the game. 
A person that chooses not to pay taxes has virtually no impact on the corrupt power structure; but they open themselves up to an energy draining battle. Instead of having the time and energy to build a parallel economy; they may have to spend their time and energy fighting the tax man. 
I am absolutely for abolishing super-governments; but not paying your taxes is probably the least effective way of doing so. 
Once we build a better system it will be easy to entice people to join us. They will be able to do so freely and without legal risk to themselves. As the fiat leaks out and into Bitcoin; the corrupt power structure wanes on its own, without any direct battle.
Instead of trying to convince people to risk life and limb not paying taxes; We focus on building a better world where people decide of their own volition to join.  Even if nobody paid taxes the corrupt power systems could still print at will.
It is the source of power (the monetary printing press) that must be defeated; and it can only be defeated by creating a better power source; it cannot be fought or destroyed; but it can be outcompeted.

The personal finance subreddit should really be renamed to "Out of Poverty"
The only universally good advice they give is regarding the "emergency fund" 
Think about it; the biggest piece of advice in the personal finance subreddit is that you should have money saved up.
Personal finance is for those who are almost out on the streets. Bitcoin is too risky for these people; they may see it as their only hope and put their last $1500 of their emergency fund in. Sure it would be smart of them to just hold $25 worth; but these aren't the people who make the smartest decisions to begin with; that is why they have to be told by random internet strangers that having money saved up is important.
Personal Finance should really be called "Out of Poverty" because that is really what their advice is centered around; clawing out of poverty.

It has been worth it thus far; the primary costs are time, machine investment, and shipping. It surprised me to realize I'm spending more on shipping than on raw materials. Above all the main cost sink is skilled human time.  We operate 9 FFF and 1 SLA printer. Electricity is not so bad for the machines we are running actually; at peak they only draw 360W; and most of the time they are running around 100W or less. Again the main cost of running the operation is the human time. It takes time and human skill to prepare each file, time to prepare the printers (swapping out material, maintenance, etc), time to post-process the models, and time to package and ship. Though it is really only the first step in this process that requires a skilled operator; everything else could be done by interns or minimum wage employee's.
The next step for our operation will be opening a warehouse with 5-10x as many machines as we currently operate; and a few new machines. We need to get an SLS printer; a larger SLA printer; a carbon fiber nylon printer, a laser cutter, and a 5 axis CNC mill. That is the goal; we will see if I can get us there.

While there are many conspiracies that seek ultimate power in this world; none of them have come very close to attaining it.
The US Government while being very powerful, is not all powerful. 
They can pass laws to make it illegal; but they will have a very hard time stopping Bitcoin in practice.
Pirating media and software is illegal yet the government cannot prevent it; only punish retroactively. People risk their freedom to seed TV shows and movies without promise of any compensation.
Bitcoin like Bittorrent is not possible to stop in practice.
Bitcoin unlike Bittorrent incentivizes the security of itself with revenue.
If drugs were legalized what would happen to the prices of drugs?
They would decrease.
Constraining the supply or availability of a good that is in demand almost always causes the price to rise. 
The government would have to thwart the demand for Bitcoin. However considering that it is valued in part because of its Statelessness; the effect on demand from State actors decrying Bitcoin may be minute.
Long story short:
I believe that if the US government were to make Bitcoin illegal the price would increase for the same reasons that the price of illegal drugs are inflated. Legality does little to stem demand; but will stem availability and supply.
The only scenario that kills Bitcoin is if all governments of the world got together and agreed to hunt down Bitcoin nodes and Miners.
We haven't been able to get all the leaders of the world to so much as stop killing each other all the time; the idea that world leaders will come to unanimous agreement to stop software from being run is just silly. 
And when you think about it; the only reason leaders of the world would be even attempting something like this would be if Bitcoin were taking off like wildfire among the public.
How could governments maintain control trying to ban something the vast majority are piling into? At this point defection would be rampant.
Every time I think about this a full frontal attack on Bitcoin is just not possible. It is much easier to attack psychologically and destroy it from the inside out. Trying to actually destroy Bitcoin via legislation and law enforcement may be attempted; but it will absolutely never succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:59:14
The speed at which blocks are generated depends on the difficulty and the hashrate being applied.
Right now miners make less than 1/2 their revenue if they choose to mine BCash over Bitcoin. 
If you have a business and you are operating at near 0% profit and someone comes to you and says "Hey I have this opportunity for you! I'll pay you less than 1/2 of what you are currently getting paid to do exactly the same amount of work!"
No business in their right mind would; so nobody is mining BCash except for political reasons. Those political reasons are costing them a LOT of money each day.
Anyways; when the difficulty adjusts down the miners will have a choice. It will be equally profitable to mine either chain.
So at this point a minority of hashrate could collude to destroy BCash.
For ease of numbers; lets say BCash has 10% of the Bitcoin hashrate.
Hypothetically in a few weeks the difficulty on the BCash chain will drop; making it profitable to mine. Say miners that represent 25% of the Bitcoin hashrate want to destroy BCash. So they decide they will mine BCash for 1 day; but in secret. 
After 1 day BCash has publicly found 144 blocks; the secret cartel has found 360 blocks!
The secret cartel could then publish 145+ blocks and overwrite all the history that occured on the BCash chain in those 144 blocks.
Then they could even let the BCash chain get publicly added to for another day; and do the same thing again; all with the blocks they mined in the first day.
This will be much easier to do once the difficulty drops. The reality is that miners wouldn't do this in secret for a full day; they'll just do a few blocks at a time. That will minimize their revenue loss.

While many still believe we need an increase in the blocksize (and they may be right) SegWit will release the congestion in the mempool and buy us significant time to develop solutions before a hardfork to increase blocksize(weight) will be necessary.
I am not Anti SegWit or Anti Blocksize increase; I am Pro-Scaling. Right now the best option for scaling is SegWit. Let us agree to upgrade Bitcoin and allow it some room to breathe while we continue to work on scaling solutions.

Bitcoin and Crypto in general is built around the principle that in practice you will never be able to "guess" someone elses private key (rare number).
However I think you are fundamentally mistaken by equivocating private keys with the Bitcoin asset itself.
The private keys control access to the Bitcoin asset. The private keys aren't the asset itself. You can send Bitcoin from a private key to another; that doesn't destroy the original private key but that key no longer can move bitcoin assets.
So in your example Bitcoins, the asset, are the "car" and the car keys are the keys (rare number).
Just because somebody can find a key for your car doesn't mean it is their car.
Just like the car, you cannot simply will more Bitcoins into existence ; they must be created (mined) by an expenditure of resources approximately equal to the value of the Bitcoin produced.

One Bitcoin is 100million units just as One million dollars is composed of 100million cents.
There are no such things as Bitcoins. There is the Bitcoin network and Satoshi's are the fundamental currency unit on the Bitcoin Network.
A "Bitcoin" doesn't exist except in our minds. Today we say that 100million Satoshi's = 1 Bitcoin.
The Truth is that there is a limit of 2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi's on the Bitcoin Network. 
However you want to organize those Satoshi's is up to the users; but the fundamental unit is the Satoshi. A "Bitcoin" is 100% arbitrary.
We could say a Bitcoin is 1Billion Satoshi's and now there are only 2.1Million Bitcoins.

Oh; and when the FDA won't allow certain drugs to be tested in the US due to risk; companies are allowed to go to Europe, sometimes South America, sometimes Africa, and test their drugs there and use those test results to convince the FDA to allow testing in the US. 
There are fucked up babies being born in certain asian countries being injected with allogeneic stem cells shortly after birth just for experimentation. These people will suffer a lifetime of serious auto-immune issues; if they survive to adulthood at all. And US companies are allowed to collaborate and use the research from these companies outside the states.
There is so much fucked up shit going on; we are experimenting on sick and dying in the US; children outside the US. If your treatment is too dangerous or risky for the regular trial process; you can appeal to run your trial on those who are already very sick. On the one hand the idea is these people are about to kick the bucket and they are ready for a hail mary. On the other hand it creates an unseemly situation where the sickest among us are taken advantage of by drug companies. Some are legit; but some really are modern snake-oil salesmen.
And it all comes back to "statistical significance" nobody gives a shit about magnitude; just is it statistically significant. It doesn't matter if the treatment only provides 1% relief; just that the 1% is statistically significant. And the statisticians just like to try to baffle people with their bullshit; knowing very few know wtf a two-tailed t-test or that it if you find reasons to disregard data points you don't like (there is always a reason) you can find correlations and statistical significance SOMEWHERE. Collect enough data, throw out enough data points; you'll find that your product did something in a statistically significant manner.
Sorry for this rant; but I guess; having worked in the industry (mind you this is only one opinion) that the FDA has good intentions; but all it does is create a game. Instead of focusing on the science and the results, the companies are focused on appeasing what the FDA thinks is important regarding the science. And companies can get around any kind of ethical considerations by just using foreign countries to experiment in.

It seems trivial. There are plenty of coins with alternative PoW. Why do those who want Big Blocks insist on taking over Bitcoins current Blockchain and miners? Why don't they just create a separate network and let the market decide? If the market wants big blocks it will succeed.

Discussing Bitcoin is met with derision. Even if you try to avoid a political discussion it is impossible to have an actual conversation about Bitcoin with someone who is "informed" by the news but doesn't actually do their own research into the goings on of the world.

"Isn't Bitcoin just used for Drugs? I heard they used it to to hire hitmen on Silk Road"
"Isn't Bitcoin dead after Mt Gox?
"Why not just use your credit card?"
"The government will just shut it down if it gets too big"
"There is nothing backing bitcoin; its just a ponzi, or frenzy like Dutch Tulips"
"Isn't it controlled by China?"
"A non-inflationary currency would destroy the economy"
"A non-regulated, pseudonymous asset will breed crime and corruption"
The people that must be "convinced" don't deserve Bitcoin. These are the same people that will support war, slavery, and corruption as long as its not in their backyard.

You seem very upset about this issue and I think it may be inhibiting your reading comprehension. The study you linked actually says that the incidence of ADR's is 16.88%; the one I provided suggested the incidence rate is only 6.7%; but the study I linked was discussing serious ADR's. I'm not sure why you think this study refutes my claim. 
To perform a comprehensive systematic review of prospective studies about frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring during hospitalization (ADR(In) ), including a thorough study quality assessment, meta-analysis and heterogeneity evaluation.
Systematic review of several databases: Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, ISI, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Scirus, NHS economic, and others, as well as manual search. Inclusion criteria were: prospective studies (assessing all patients before discharge, by a specialized team, at least once a week); with data about ADRs occurring during hospitalization, using WHO's or similar definition of ADR. Two independent reviewers assessed eligibility criteria, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias.
From 4139 studies initially found, 22 were included. Meta-analysis indicate that ADRs may occur in 16.88% (CI95%: 13.56,20.21%) of patients during hospitalization; however, this estimate has to be viewed with caution because there was significant heterogeneity (I²  = 99%). The most significant moderators of heterogeneity were risk of bias, population, ward, and methodology for ADR identification. Low risk of bias studies adjusted for population (pediatric versus adult) had I²  = 0%.
These data are useful as a broad characterization of in-hospital ADRs and their frequency. However, due to heterogeneity, our estimates are crude indicators. The wide variation in methodologies was one of the most important moderators of heterogeneity (even among studies using intensive monitoring). We suggest criteria to standardize methodologies and reduce the risk of bias.

I called him a government pawn, and I'm not walking away from that claim. 
I say that his government pays him while he trolls on reddit, very publicly. He directly represents his university and government when he chooses to post on reddit under jstolfi.
He represents them; he is paid by them. He promotes opinions that are beneficial to the state. It is not unreasonable to suggest he is being paid to troll on reddit. 
Most employers would be furious to find out that their employee's are spending work hours publicly trolling the internet. It reflects poorly on the employer; and most employers wont stand for it. Yet Jstolfi posts for years publicly; reflecting not just on him; but the University and the Government of Brazil. 
The fact is; he is getting paid by a corrupt government. He uses the time that he is being paid to troll on reddit. He may engage in some minimal duties related to his official position, but he does post during what should be normal work hours in Brazil. 
His corrupt government oppresses people to get the money to pay him; and he spends a substantial portion of that time trolling on reddit.
Whether it is the governments intention to pay him to troll on Reddit is more difficult to determine. Considering his opinions promote the corrupt state; and he is being paid by a corrupt state; it is not unreasonable to believe there is a conflict of interest.

I think it will be good to see SegWit rolled out on a coin that has a significant history and value to secure. If there aren't issues that arise as a result then I think this will in fact give more confidence to miners to support SegWit.
My take on Altcoins is that they can be test-beds for Bitcoin features. There is some value at stake so there is an incentive to game any potential problems in the code. Basically rolling this out on Litecoin is like putting out a bug bounty. 
However; someone may find a bug and not act on it in hopes that nobody else will find it when it is rolled out into Bitcoin. So we will need some time to hopefully allow multiple people to find any potential bugs and exploit them.
I think we will see miners adopt SegWit in about 6months or so. There is significant profit for them to see how high the fee ceiling can get. They don't want the bottom of the fee market to fall out. We need a sustained 4-8mb backlog with high fee's before it will make economic sense for them to increase transaction rate.

A soft fork provides more flexibility for the entire ecosystem to adapt; and a hard fork for non-emergency reasons is a bad precedent.
With a soft-fork nodes do not have to upgrade in order for the network to stay unified. The nodes can choose to Opt-In and gain the benefits of SegWit; but they can also keep their current software. SegWit blocks will still be valid to nodes that have not upgraded.
So to keep the network as unified as possible SegWit is being launched as a soft-fork that requires 95% of the mining hashrate to signal. 
With a hardfork; even if 5% continued to mine the old chain; many nodes that hadn't upgraded would relay the blocks as being valid. There would be two Bitcoin blockchains; and miners would start wavering between the two. Eventually we would end up with an Ether and Ether Classic situation. Most people agree that this would strike a blow to the confidence of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
In addition to the almost guaranteed currency split; it would set a bad precedence for the Hardforked chain. What other parameters may be changed? Perhaps the 21M coin limit or other critical protocol features. 
SegWit soft fork is brilliant in my opinion.

Coinbase has an option to turn your buy into a Weekly or Daily buy.
Instead of plopping down $2500 all at once; $50 a week for a year. You won't make as much profit if the price goes to the moon right now; but if the price goes down you will end up with much more Bitcoin. If you have a long term perspective this is ideal.

Coinbase is an intermediary; and they may ask you questions about the source of your funds and/or where you are sending it.
You could also just send the coins directly from the ATM to whomever you are paying; just have them give you a QR code and use that at the Bitcoin ATM.

The overdose deaths by illicit use includes everyone who died from illicit use inside or outside the hospital.
The ADRs that resulted in deaths were only recorded from patients admitted to the hospital. So you are correct that there are likely many more people who die from ADR's outside of the clinical setting where it may be more difficult to determine cause of death. 
If anything that means there are more people dying from doctor prescribed medications than were cited.

Because they have had every opportunity to start their own coin and grow it organically rather than attempt to co-opt the Bitcoin community by forking off our Blockchain.
They are a parasite riding off Bitcoin's shared history and they furthermore attempt to increase the confusion by using "Bitcoin" in the name as well as using an already taken acronym "BCC"
I've got just as many BCash as I do Bitcoin (well slightly less since my last buys) so I can't say I'm mad when its price increases. However I do believe that it represents an attack vector to true Bitcoin and therefore I would be quite pleased if its value went to zero.
As long as the cumulative value of Bitcoin and BCash increases there will be many happy campers.

The US ran into its Debt Ceiling earlier this year and has been taking extraordinary measures to avoid raising it. The US federal government has been spending down its balances to dangerously low levels.
Raising the debt ceiling has historically been a challenging political issue that has resulted in short term government shut downs. The difference is that in the past the US never took extraordinary measures to avoid raising the debt ceiling; meaning the US had a cushion to allow us to continue paying bonds and other debts.
It has become such a serious possibility that the Federal Reserve is considering announcing that not only will they not be purchasing new government bonds; but they will start unwinding their balance sheet. 
This will cause a tightening in the supply of new money; which will cause the value of USD to increase; which will cause everything priced in USD to decrease (crash). 
It will cause the value of bonds to diminish; and considering these are held as securities by individuals, corporations, banks, and nations around the world; this devaluation would open Pandoras box regarding its effects on the global economy.
The Fed is considering making this announcement the last Friday in September; which is right around when we will run out of emergency funds. So October 2nd would naturally be the first day markets can react to the news. Though you'd think traders would act early.

In my mind we are not fighting the banks but their ability to print and inflate money at will.
I believe that the ability to print money that is accepted by decree is the ultimate source of systemic corruption.
Bitcoin wins by co-opting the existing system. 
This will give them the ability to hold Bitcoin while simultaneously using their private blockchain. 
The more that banks hold Bitcoin the more that they value it. The more they are saying "this is money" The more that big institutions hold; the more confidence the general public has in it. 
At a certain point a tipping point is reached; big institutions want Bitcoin; individuals want Bitcoin; so who wants green sheets of paper anymore? Fucking nobody; and that is when Slave money dies and governments die/shrink.
Bitcoin is co-opting the idea of value and wealth. It is open to everyone to use in any way the protocol allows. The more inclusive the better. One day we will wake up and realize nobody uses slave money anymore.

Bitcoin is a long term game, and an experiment at that.
If Bitcoin is still here in 10 years, it is very likely to be worth multiples of what it is worth today.
In the next few years, who knows. 
If you have money that you can afford to keep locked away for 5-10 years, AND you can afford to lose it if the experiment fails; Buy Now.
If you need to access that money or for some reason need a return in a year or two, Bitcoin may be too risky for you.
Its long term value will almost certainly increase if it survives, and I do believe it will survive.
Just remember, No Risk, No Reward. Bitcoin is very high risk, with a very high potential reward.

Last weekend I paid around $50 as a transaction fee to consolidate 3.5 years worth of UTXO's and it was included in the next block. I could have paid far less and it would have eventually been confirmed; but I desired faster confirmation so I paid the higher fee. These were all multisig as well which increased the signature data considerably.
Yesterday I received a BTC transaction that was included in the first block which cost the sender $2.08 . I'm imagining it could have been much less if we didn't desire it to be included quickly.
I also received a PayPal transaction yesterday; and the fee on that was $2.32 . I think it is funny that PayPal charges the merchant fee's rather than the purchaser. The fee only helps the purchaser by giving them chargeback ability but in no way helps the merchant.
Anyways from a merchant perspective I would still gladly pay the BTC transaction fee's for clients rather than PayPal. You pay PayPal fee's then the money still isn't even yours for 90 days. You pay BTC fee's and the money is irrevocably yours in an hour or so. 
I agree that fee's are hurting some use cases; but I'd rather some use cases be lost rather than our core functionality of censorship resistant, private, trustless, finite money.

I'm not in favor of 2x; but I believe people should be allowed to change their opinions. 
Politicians you don't want changing their opinions because that usually just means they are pandering to whoever they are in front of and are spineless.
Technicians, developers, philosophers, private individuals, etc can change their minds and it doesn't mean they are hypocrites or bought out. It could mean that; but I think all this character attack is getting way out of hand.
I used to be in favor of big blocks until we did the first few stress tests and saw that mempool backlog didn't cause nodes to drop off or any other catastrophe. 
My main reason for being against 2x isn't the 2Mb limit; its the idea of Hard Forking without existential threat. 
If we just fork off all the time that will completely destroy the idea of the 21M finite limit. 
We could reach a situation where the longest chain is the forked chain; and that would be very confusing and likely damaging for Bitcoin.
With BCash both being the forked chain and minority hashpower; and shorter chain; it is easy to say that BCash is not Bitcoin.
If 2X chain is longer and has more hashpower; it may be difficult for a long time to know which coin is Bitcoin. Both will have a claim to the throne. One is the longest chain secured by the greatest hash power; the other is the longest "valid" chain that has followed consensus rules the longest.
2X is not critically necessary right now so I would prefer we don't fork for the above reasons. However I don't think a fork will be the end of the world; but could initiate a long bear-market until the situation is fully resolved.

I don't think you are understanding me.
Could you explain why USDT/USD volume matters for determining Tethers fair market value than USDT/BTC and USDT/Crypto in general?
What about all the coins that have no USD pairing at all and are only traded against Bitcoin; does this mean they have no value?
More than 2 Billion USD worth of USDT is traded against the rest of the crypto market every day. Its freely traded alongside alts and Bitcoin and the market of buyers and sellers determines the price. 
Again; I'm not saying that Tether has $1 in the bank for every 1 USDT; I'm saying that the market of buyers and sellers have given Tether a value of ~$1 USD and that the USD/USDT trade volume has little if anything to do with the fair value of USDT; or the value of Bitcoin or any Crypto for that matter.
If I'm understanding you correctly you are saying that unless there is $1 USD in the bank for every USDT issued that means that Tether is responsible for most of the Bitcoin Bullrun. And as a follow up that for some reason Tether has some kind of special privilege that allows them to pump the price that the other 2000 unbacked altcoins don't have.

Bitcoin is more like a mycelial network than a virus. Beneath and within the soil on this planet is a fungal network of mycellium. These are little tubes that connect the root systems of the Tree's the grasses, and pretty much all the plants in the environment. 
This network has evolved over time into a symbiotic organism with plant life. The mycellium shuttles nutrients from plants with excess to plants in need. In turn the plants produce sugars which the fungus feeds off. It is a win-win situation.
Bitcoins network is symbiotic as well, it shuttles transactions to where they need to go; and in exchange people provide hashes to the network. The network further rewards those who provide the most/best hashes with a Bitcoin reward.
A virus is a poor comparison; they invade often through some kind of trojan horse, tricking the cells into letting them in, they commandeer the cells vital resources into reproducing itself; sometimes it even alters the DNA of the cell it infects. The cell is then depleted of resources and the virus spreads to other cells until it either kills the host or is eliminated. That doesn't sound in any way analogous to Bitcoin.

It is interesting that you feel it necessary to demonize and attack the character of the people you disagree with. However it does help demonstrate that your argument lacks substance.
Signing a message with a private key does not require an internet connection. While it may take a few minutes of time out of his busy schedule, it would be in his and WL best interest to provide proof of life since it is vitally important to maintain WL credibility.
Tell me, since this subject matter is only of discourse for batshit insane consiracytard lunatics, why do you bother arguing the issue? You do realize there are people who believe in interdimensional lizards that rule over a flat-hollow-earth and that hitler and the dinosaurs are chilling at the center of the hollow-flat earth warmed by an inner sun? 
I suspect you don't argue over issues that truly are batshit crazy, but you use those terms to demonize your ideological opposition, in a misguided effort to bludgeon others towards your way of thinking, for fear of being grouped in with the batshit insane conspiracytard lunatics.
The way in which you communicate your point of view is not persuasive, it is not productive, and quite frankly I suspect is dangerously uninformed/misinformed.
My tip for you would be to consider your audience and your message and simply take some time to think about how to communicate your message in a way that your audience will be most receptive of it. Name-calling is hardly the way intelligent adults argue their point of view, and it is only persuasive to those who themselves would name-call to make a point; consider that.

I totally respect what you are doing with Bitcoin in this world; But we have to remember that Bitcoin is an open-source decentralized protocol.
If Bankers want to create Bitcoin businesses; by all means let them. 
Either Coinbase gives me special treatment or there is an enormous amount of undeserved hate for them here.
I've only ever had one transaction be cancelled by them; it was during a price rise so I had to re-initiate my order at a higher price. I messaged them about this; they responded promptly and they honored the original order price and manually added Bitcoin to my account to make up the difference.
They offer services that the general public needs; things like their vault service; and easy non-shady way to acquire coins. 
I would argue that even among our current adopters; a minority hold their own keys; and an even smaller percentage knows how to secure their coins with Multi-signature.
The Coinbase vault is a great solution that allows individuals to have exclusive access to their coins; while enjoying the ease of use of a trusted counterparty. Should coinbase not be trusted anymore; they only hold one key and you hold 2; so they still cannot access your funds.

In my opinion organizations like PayPal running a Hub is exactly the situation we want.
Bitcoin having both trustless and trusted layers will be enormously important if Bitcoin is to integrate itself more into the global mainstream economy. 
Large organizations that care about their reputation securing millions or billions worth of coins and transactions on the lightning network will provide peace of mind and ease of use for people who don't need trustless, censorship resistant transactions. 
Lightning network hubs will increase the choices available for Bitcoin users. Use a hub and you get to send fast, inexpensive transactions. This will be appropriate for about 80% of all use cases. The vast, vast, vast, majority of transactions do not need the security provided by Bitcoin blockchain confirmations. In fact the vast majority of mainstream users do not want irreversible transactions.
For the ~20% of transactions that would be censored by legacy channels for political or other reasons can pay to use the security provided by the blockchain.
There would also be Hubs that would promise their users to not censor transactions in exchange for higher fee's.
 So there will end up being a sliding scale between nearly free payments through giant hubs with enormous KYC/AML; and more expensive payments through upstart Hubs that don't do thorough KYC/AML.
If I understand Lightning and Segwit this upgrade is about to strengthen the network enormously by adding monetary incentive to run nodes. This will also improve the balance of power between miners and node operators as well; since they will both be important for transaction processing.
It is kind of a way to get a hybrid PoW/PoS but instead of stakers just getting rewarded for staking; they are providing real liquidity to the network. In exchange they supposedly use that profit to increase their nodes security against attacks.

Brilliant really. I mean many people have seen this coming for literally thousands of years. Not exactly the technology per se; but a society completely and entirely controlled from the top down.
The owners of society feel that we are a liability to their continued success and security and need to protect themselves by instituting total top-down control. Everyone will gladly accept this control after a global starvation event triggered by climactic conditions (or at least blamed on climate change). The problem will be identified as the plurality of nations skirting environmental laws by moving factories to wherever the laws are least strict. The solution of course will be to unify the governments of the world so that there is a uniform system of law to prevent these catastrophes.
We are entering a new kind of slavery; its control will be so complete and pervasive that humans will not understand the concept of freedom or self-directed action. Every action will be defined or at least the individual will feel compelled to behave in exactly the "appropriate" ways; "deciding" on their own to do exactly what the state desires.
They don't need us for tax revenue; they need a small subsection to maintain the machines and do their dirty work.

I think you're the salty one here. 
Almost everyone who has held has made far more gains than you have. 
I'm just trying to provide balance to help prevent people from losing their shirt trading.
People win the lottery all the time; yet the odds of winning the lottery are exceptionally low. Does that mean that the lottery winners actually predicted the numbers? No. Just like in your case; the odds of 84 net positive trades has no bearing on your future trading. 
A lottery winner should not expect they have the ability to win the lottery again because they did it before. They got lucky.
There are traders out there who make hundreds of millions in good trades every year for decades on end. This doesn't mean they will continue to make hundreds of millions in good trades. It just means they are lucky.
In blinded by randomness there is a great example.
Consider a hypothetical scenario where a bank hires 10,000 new traders. For ease of simplicity lets say that every year 50% of them pull their weight and keep their jobs and 50% of them don't.
So after the first year you are left with 5000 of the "best traders"
After 10 years you are left with the top 10 traders who have consistently had great years for the past 10 years.
Until next year when 5 of them are wiped out.
It is luck.

I'm not sure we are understanding each other.
I'm not claiming there is any backing or intrinsic "pegging" of USDT to USD.
What I'm saying is that the market is what determines the value. Just like any coin; even if there are no USD pairings it is traded against other coins which do have USD pairings.
So before LTC had USD pairings it was traded against BTC and this gave it a market price that could be translated into USD. Of course like all coins it fluctuates in price. It still had "value", determined by the market, even when it couldn't be traded directly for USD. 
Tether is no more and no less than an altcoin that is actively managed to attempt to keep the value of USDT=USD. 
Value is entirely psychological; there is no fixed basis for value. The fact that people can trade tether for BTC and other crypto's at a rate of 1 USDT = 1 USD means that for the time being Tether does in fact have that "value".
When one sells or buys a Bitcoin they are selling or buying it at the fair value at that time. The seller agree's on the value, the buyer agrees on the value, and an exchange is made. The very next day the "value" of Bitcoin as measured in dollars may have changed but that doesn't mean the buyer or seller made a mistake and sold too low or bought too high ; it was the fair value determined at the time.
Look at things like "BillionaireCoin" or whatever that scam is called. Supposedly worth trillions of dollars each ; but obviously there is no buying or selling of these; there is no market to support the price. The market is what determines the value. No market = no value. 
Tether may or may not have a 1:1 backing but I fail to see what privilege tether has over any other coin out there.  Most coins explicitly have $0 backing them; simply the market.

Bitcoin was developed to be decentralized with no central point of failure; no head to cut off. 
It is part of an evolution of private, stateless money. It was developed understanding the strengths and weaknesses of previous attempts at stateless money. 
Satoshi knew from the beginning that he/she/them would have to disappear. In fact I think it is likely that Satoshi never existed as individual. More likely that prominent members of the cyberpunk mailing list decided to use the name as a pseudonym for a group of individuals. Knowing that if Bitcoin is successful they may be targeted personally; Satoshi was created to throw people off the tracks. Satoshi is most likely a group 3-5 prominent members of the Cyberpunk mailing list that were also involved in HashCash and perhaps the Liberty Dollar.

At least with Bitcoin we designed a system such that we can trust that the issuers will almost always act in rational self interest.

When I watched Ver's video from the 18th I sold most of my BCH.
Up until then I strongly believed the Ver simply had a difference in philosophy regarding Bitcoin.
He used a graph that showed the blocksize limit being reached earlier this year; juxtaposed to a graph showing the % MarketCap of Bitcoin decreasing from 2013-2017.
Then he goes on to say that this shows that AltCoins gained popularity BECAUSE of the Blocksize limit; even though the graph actually shows that the % MarketCap has been steadily decreasing since 2013.
He does this again when he shows a picture of the Transaction fee's skyrocketing juxtaposed with a picture of the %MarketCap to make it look like as transaction fee's increase Bitcoin suffered.
Lets ignore that the marketcap is up 2,000% in 24months; because showing that graph would make the exact opposite point.
And yet again when he shows the Altcoin MarketCap in dollars skyrocketing; juxtaposed to the Bitcoin MarketCap% declining. 
Lets just ignore that not only are the X-axis completely different ranges; but comparing a dollar value to a % is completely pointless.
After watching that video the only conclusions I can come to is that
1) Ver is full blown Scam Artist
2) Ver is a lucky early investor that is speaking on topics he is so ignorant of he doesn't know how cringey he sounds.
3) Ver is flabbergasted that BCash has not become more popular and has resorted to outright deceitful strategies to convince people.
That video is dripping with deceit; whether he has the best intentions in mind or he is a scam artist; it was completely deceitful.

FACT: Increasing Blocksize Increases Cost of Running a Node
FACT: Cost affects Demand; increasing costs for a good or service reduces the demand.
FACT: Increasing the Blocksize does not increase the reward for running a node.
Opinion: Due to the facts that it will cost more to run a node and this more expensive node does not do anything to offset those costs, the number of nodes will dwindle.
Bitcoin still is P2P cash; it just simply cannot be scaled to VISA or Paypal levels.
I'm not trying to be rude, but why do you think Bitcoin as it exists should change? Anyone can create their own coin. Why not create MassPaymentCoin?
Because there are already solutions for mass payment networks; and they rely on the economics of centralization and censorship in order to complete their task cost effectively. 
Nobody wants to invest in MassPaymentCoin that can be shut down at a moments notice because all 200 of its centralized nodes were handed a National Security Letter. We need a diversity of nodes in different regions, on different hardware, on the regular good ole internet, on TOR, through VPN.

That would be assuming that 332 out of 333 have 0.000000 BTC :
If we assume a 80/20 distribution (the top 20% own 80%; the bottom 80% own 20%) ;
There would be 16.8Million Bitcoins for the worlds wealthiest 1.4Billion people to share and 4.2Million for the rest of the 5.6Billion to share.
Among that top 20% we can further assume a 80/20 distribution
So the worlds wealthiest 280Million people will have 13.4Million coins to split.
If we repeat this process 3 more times we get an estimate that the wealthiest 11Million people will have a total of 8Million coins to split amongst themselves.
Somewhere between 2 and 10million people will ever own 1 full Bitcoin or more.

They might not understand quite how high that risk is without some people pointing out that normal people would be morons to store large amounts of funds on an exchange.
A calculated risk is a trader that holds coins on an exchange to make profit. They will most likely lose, but it is a conscious calculated risk.
An uncalculated risk is a general Bitcoin enthusiast who buys Bitcoins and then leaves them on an exchange because its easier. They likely don't realize exactly how risky that is. For people with lots of assets losing 10 to 50 Bitcoins isn't such a life changing event. For most normal people that would be and they need to understand that holding a large sum on an exchange for simple storage is a moronic idea.
Now if you utilize a multi-sig exchange wallet where you control at least 2 of the keys; that is much different. But most people smart enough to do that already have their Bitcoin off exchange.

I think there are a good number of us who believe Bitcoin has a strong chance of eventually reaching $100k-$3Million per coin. My upper end evaluation is $3.4million in 2014 USD, and obviously the lower end is $0.
I have a hard time seeing Bitcoin surviving the next 20 years without astronomical increases in valuation. If Bitcoin proves itself to be a secure, permissionless, stateless, store of value, which also happens to be quite finite, it seems difficult to imagine how demand will not eventually push coin prices extremely high.
On the other hand, if there are found to be security flaws, or unexpected code behavior, $0/coin is certainly a possibility.

Yes we are all concerned that an infinitely inflating currency on a "turing complete" network which has already forked itself and is controlled by a single person will overtake Bitcoin as the standard for uncensorable, permissionless, digital gold payments.
Ethereum is a really cool project, but I do not see it as an investment. It is not digital gold. It is not permissionless, it is not decentralized, it is not finite, its network is not secure, it is too complicated to be properly understood by even its largest investors and smartest developers.
So Ethereum was pumped briefly to 18% and has dwindled since then to slightly less than 7% and continues its death spiral everyday.

Bitcoin Days destroyed is the number of Bitcoins moved multiplied by the interval (in days) since they last moved.
So 10 Bitcoins held for 1 day then spent = 10 Bitcoin days destroyed.
10 Bitcoins held for 10 days then spent = 100 Bitcoin days destroyed.
When a spike of Bitcoin Days Destroyed occurs it can mean that long held coins are moving ; a very large volume of coins moving ; or a combination of both.
This could mean whales moving funds out of cold storage to sell; it could mean exchanges hot wallets running dry and needing to re-up from cold storage. You can't really say anything definitive about what BDD volume means other than its definition. BDD is a good indicator to look for deeper trends ; but not indicative of anything in itself.

Tether may not be 1:1 backed by USD; but their maintenance fund has thus far been large enough to keep the market price pegged at ~$1.00. 
Has anyone not been able to trade 1 Tether for ~1 USD worth of USD or another Crypto?
While I certainly wouldn't be surprised if Tether is being taken advantage of to enrich the "printers" there clearly is an active fund maintaining the market value at $1 USD. You can see this in Tethers volume; only token that does more daily volume than its own marketcap.
The idea that "unbacked" Tether is responsible for a significant amount of the 2016-2017 bullrun is just not plausible.
Furthermore; if it is possible to create a "stablecoin" and exploit it indefinitely for free to acquire more Bitcoin; why don't other coins do this? What advantage does Tether have over the 2000 alts whose marketcaps are not reflective of their cumulative investment? 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:38:43
In that hypothetical scenario where fiat withdrawal is locked then the only way to cash out would be to trade your USDT for Bitcoin or other Crypto. 
Realistically the most likely to be affected from a Tether scam are those trading on exchanges using Tether. So those who want to "Cash out today at a certain price" would have to cash out *into* Tether, then bank account. But if you're worried about Tether collapsing why would you do this?
So if I were a trader (I am just a long time holder) that was worried about Tether collapsing affecting my exchanges ability to honor their obligations; I would send my Bitcoin to an exchange that doesn't deal with Tether.
Which then makes me think; who is still trading on exchanges that use USDT? People who are either completely ignorant; or people who don't believe a 1:1 backing is important for Tether.  Markets are entirely psychology; so if the people that are exchanging Crypto for USDT back and forth simply care about the market determined rate and not about reserve ratios; then the reality is that even with 10% backing, Tether could operate without issue.

If this ends up causing a lot of Bitcoiners to have their transactions audited, I think the IRS will learn their lesson.
I can't imagine there are all that many that would be stupid enough to use Coinbase to evade taxes. Everything done there is KYC/AML and transactions are already reported to the IRS. 
If they decide to try to audit everyone who bought from Coinbase and then sent to cold-storage or another wallet that they control it could be an extremely time-consuming audit that ends up netting nothing.
I can just imagine them making us bust out our cold-storage so that we can sign a message with each and every private key that you own; only to find out that you've actually paid your taxes, or worse, they owe us. It would be quite a novel exercise.

Could you elaborate? I'm curious why you think raising the bandwidth and processor requirement for nodes wouldn't increase the resource demand for running a node? 
Resources are in demand. A node requires resources to run. A node produces no direct benefit to the individual and is therefore prone to a tragedy of the commons. Enthusiastic Bitcoiners may not even run a node because it slows down their PC too much. 
Who is going to run nodes when it costs hundreds of dollars per year in bandwidth and processor time? Some people sure.
Who is going to run nodes when it costs almost nothing because technology(resource availability) continues to increase and the amount of resources required to run Bitcoin Core stays the same? A hell of a lot more people.
Bitcoin only has value because it is decentralized. The moment it becomes possible to identify all the gatekeepers is the moment Bitcoin dies. 
Bitcoin is in its most fragile state of infancy right now but as technology improves running Bitcoin in the background of almost every internet connected device will be commonplace.

The price rise has substantial volume associated with it. The reason those small 0.1BTC orders move the price more than 10BTC orders is that I believe these small orders are not traders; but new buyers.
Smart Traders dont want slippage; so they'll wait for someone to put 10-50 coins at near market price and then gobble them up.
People who just want to buy Bitcoin now don't care about slippage and so they'll just buy that 0.1BTC wherever it is; and if there is a $10 gap between buy and sell then that order will cause the price to jump $10.
But overall this price rise is correlated with healthy volume; so I do believe we are seeing some organic growth as the result of Bitcoin breaking into new market segments.

Only invest in Bitcoin because you understand the technology and want to support the kind of financial revolution Bitcoin can bring about AND are willing to completely lose your investment. 
Nobody knew if it was a good investment at $2; $20; $200; or now and nobody will know tomorrow. Anyone who knows what the market will do has inside knowledge; everyone else is just guessing.

Been here for a few years. It is a completely mixed bag. 
The truth is that there is/has been a large astroturfing campaign to demonize Bitcoin by media outlets and sockpuppet accounts since Bitcoin was first created. 
This sub concentrates people interested in Bitcoin and we are sick of hearing unwarranted criticism of Bitcoin by people who have absolutely no understanding of its technical innovations or economic/political consequences. There are many paid trolls here and throughout the internet to spread FUD about Bitcoin that feeds off the fact that many casual bitcoiners have only a fleeting understanding of the technical underpinnings of the Network.
There is absolutely plenty of heated argument and disagreement within this "community" over technical and economic considerations. 
What aspect of Bitcoin do you feel is being ignored in this subreddit?

Energy companies routinely produce much more energy than is needed at any given moment to account for peak usage.
Converting electricity to battery storage is very inefficient.
Electricity companies are realizing that they can mine with excess electricity. Essentially they are realizing that they always have a customer no matter how much power they produce. Just a few successful energy companies doing this could set the stage for this new business model.

R3 is hilarious. Honestly insane how much more money than brains some people have. How do people get so much money while being so ignorant and uninformed? 
When organizations begin to really understand the problems that Blockchains can solve (and those that they cannot) groups like R3 will be regarded as highly uninformed. It seems with their dwindling membership maybe organizations are actually beginning to understand the futility of private or federated blockchains compared to either a centrally maintained database or a public blockchain.
 Private blockchains have all the downsides of central database, and all the downsides and costs of blockchain security, and they get none of the benefits of centralization, and none of the benefits a public blockchain provides. It is hilarious that these major banks and financial institutions are participating in this "consortium" it seriously makes them look like morons.
Don't get me wrong; The blockchain has a future in finance; but the way R3 is going about it is dead in the water. If anyone from R3 is interested I'd be happy to explain to you exactly why your project is doomed to failure; I'll do it for just a few BTC just PM me.

Sounds a lot like Craig Wrights handwaving for the reason he doesn't sign any message. Sounds a lot like the behavior of an organization that has been compromised but has not been able to compromise their keys.
Might as well not use digital signatures or PGP; I mean its useless since it doesn't irrefutably prove anything... I suppose why should WL and Assange even bother using PGP in the first place if the moment their signatures are called into question there is just a bunch of handwaving about the futility of digital signatures.
Either Assange is purposefully trying to draw skepticism about his well-being or Assange's twitter and WL has been compromised. He's not an idiot, and certainly wouldn't want people to blindly trust anyone who calls themselves Wikileaks.
If WL has been compromised it can literally mean life or death for people considering sending WL new leaks. The fact that WL refuses to provide cryptographic proof should be enough to deter anyone with sensitive information from sharing it. It is very unlikely that Assange is fine and WL is operating normally. So far the Cryptographic evidence points towards WL being compromised.

I can't believe you don't see how you've made my point for me.
Yes if we are all altruistic and spend our hard earned money to help support the network then we can raise the blocksize without compromising decentralization and resilience. 
If we are all altruistic and spend our hard earned money to help support our communities there would be no need for law and order, no government, no crime. 
You have half a dozen half-baked assertions throughout your post that makes it clear you are out of your league.
Yes we only have a few thousand nodes and that is with the current 1MB limit; Bitcoin is still fragile and increasing the blocksize would make it much harder to run a node, even in "developed" countries.
Nodes are identified by an IP address, but that address can be masked by VPN's and the TOR network. These privacy conscious networks have significantly reduced bandwidth and we threaten the ability to run nodes whose owners cannot be identified.
CPU time is a limiting factor; if you look into the technical details just a little bit you'd realize that transaction processing and verification increase the demands on the CPU non-linearly.
Bitcoin is not and will never be ready for mass adoption. Let's not break it for the purpose of trying to appeal to people who will never stop using their CC's and Paypal accounts. 
Gold has been around for thousands of years and is not used by the masses. The masses will never want trustless money; they want someone to blame when something goes wrong and most of them are too busy to have to learn how to secure their money.
Bitcoin is not for the masses. Fiat is for the masses. Bitcoin is for those who choose to opt-in. Bitcoin offers a revolutionary transaction service; that service comes at a cost. There are technical limitations to Digital Gold, attempting to pretend those limitations don't exist is a great way to destroy what we have created.

Profit motive is absolutely great! There is nothing wrong with it at all. My point is more that Bitcoin is prone to violent swings in price; and if you are in it to make short term profit you could end up losing a lot of money by selling low and buying high. You'll be more hardened against these price swings if you have a long term outlook that relies on network fundamentals rather than an outlook dependent on the price and media attention. 
Profit is a beautiful motivator; we wouldn't have bitcoin without the profit motive.

That is entirely likely ; Tether is just another shitcoin to make its masters profit ; but I don't see how this impacts Bitcoins market defined price much at all. 
Say for instance it is determined that Tether is a complete scam ; what does this mean for Bitcoin? Nothing really. People will scramble to sell their tether for dollars, BTC and other Crypto. Tether will collapse and exchanges that relied heavily on it will suffer. 
This whole nonsense of Tether being responsible for the bullrun is just a psychological ploy. The market determines the price and the market is pure psychology.

Yes that is true that; an equilibrium would quickly be found and many people would decide it wasn't worth the cost to transact at the moment.
Its important that the Network is not vulnerable to an actual "shutdown" event. We know that even with an enormous backlog that the BTC network operates just fine ; even if Tx are very costly.
Other systems that leverage centralization to increase Tx rate tend to do a good job at less direct cost to users ; but are vulnerable to systemic shutdown.
A centralized system can recoup from a shutdown event. There are CEO's, officers, managers, and many people who are responsible for keeping the centralized system running.
With Bitcoin (a decentralized system) there is no CEO, corporate officers, or managers that can coordinate a plan to get the network running stably again. This is one of the reasons many people decided that Bitcoin should primarily scale transactions off-chain. If the network were vulnerable to simply being spammed to death it could have a shutdown event that it never recovered from.

Uneducated small time investors "average people" are not important for Bitcoin or Bitcoins price. 
Those that educate themselves on the importance and potential of PoW secured Blockchain (Bitcoin) are important because they will hold longterm and reduce the supply available for trading. They don't need to be rich or buy lots of Bitcoin; they just need to understand it and hold it for the long term, off exchange. An army of holders/earners, 10million people investing $2/day is enough to bring the price to $12k, even without any whales. In 2022 that will be enough to bring the price to $24k.
But those uneducated small time investors "average people" are absolutely toxic for any investment. These "average people" get interested as the price is rising and then FOMO at the ATH. These "average people" invest more than they can lose into something they dont understand simply due to blind greed. Then these very same people sell for a loss and cause the market to be oversold.
These "average people" behave in statistically predictable ways; and they will be fleeced by the quants and whales that control every major market.
Bitcoin has never been and never will be for "average people"
Don't worry though; the average person will benefit from Bitcoin taking over the financial backend. Bitcoin will make life better for the average person; even if the average person never buys or holds Bitcoin.

I don't believe that it follows that if Tether turns out to be a scam (which it likely is) that this would cause a loss of confidence in Bitcoin.
Just like when other altcoins are proven to be scams; this doesn't cause loss of confidence in Bitcoin.
Why would people who are trading in USDT rather have USD over USDT? Why are they trading against USDT instead of USD in the first place when there are plenty of exchanges that offer USD trading pairs?
Its because USDT offers advantage over USD in availability and some people (mistakenly) believe, tax implications. I don't really think many people care if USDT is backed as long as there is enough backing to keep the market determined price ~$1. Just like nobody cares that there isn't $110Billion of USD backing the $110Billion Bitcoin marketcap. Its a well maintained market determined value and thats really all that matters.
This theory about Tether is as lame as "willybot" : Both are true (Tether is probably operating a fractional reserve, and willybot did happen) but neither significantly contributed to Bitcoins bullruns. Just ways for nocoiners to feel better about losing out.

Having a fixed finite limit is neccessary for the Bitcoin network to succeed.
Miners need to get paid. Who is going to buy coins from a miner today that will be worth less tomorrow due to inflation?
Although we currently have an inflationary currency, the fact that a finite number will ever be created is part of what spurs on the speculation that gives bitcoin a high enough price to maintain the most powerful computer network on the planet. 
The use cases for Bitcoin are relatively small right now.
1) Save money by taking advantage of gift cards and friction with fiat currency; aka Gyft + Purse
2) Small but growing remmittance services
3) Access to alternative markets
4) Believing the price will be higher in the future due to demand overcoming supply. More easily attainable with a finite supply (which will actually decrease due to loss). If supply remains the same then supposedly as demand increases, so will the price.
5) Political or Philosophical Reasons
Those are really the 5 reasons I imagine people buying and using Bitcoin right now. In the future you can add escape from capital controls, and hopefully a lot of other use cases.
But the main reason why Bitcoin has a high value is its limited supply. The technology itself represents a breakthrough in finance. By being mathematically limited and controlled by nobody, Bitcoins continued existence will one day force it to become a defacto global trade standard. A financial tool that cannot be manipulated by any party will be highly valuable in a world of increasing deceit. The global bitcoin exchange rate will demonstrate discrepancies between official rates and real values of local currencies, erasing confidence in official rates and currency.
There are a lot of complicated financial tools to facilitate trade between parties that don't trust each other, Bitcoin will make it more simple.
If the US and Russia want to make a deal with each other, for labor or products in exchange for currency, why doesn't one government just print the money it needs to cover the deal? There is a lot of complication due to this and many other issues of distrust. With Bitcoin being uncontrolled and finite the US or Russia couldn't just "print" more, and so they can secure a deal with bitcoin. It would be like trading services/products for gold or oil, but much easier and less messy.

Not neccessarily. 
Transactions within centralized services aren't broadcast to the blockchain, but sometimes their users send BTC to 3rd party services. 
The centralized service can collect all the transactions to and from various other 3rd party services and then every few days simply broadcast the "net" of all the transactions.
For example (completely hypothetical) users on something like Circle, could send to other Circle users and merchants instantly, offchain. But if a circle user wanted to send coins to a coinbase user, circle and coinbase could agree to process the transaction "offchain" immediately, but then wait 3-4 days and then whoever owed whom after this time period would broadcast a transaction towards the party owed.
In this way centralized services can use Bitcoin to settle with each other, but not broadcast every single transaction.

The thing is that the BCH chain has been operating at 10-20% difficulty levels (trending downward) ; so overtaking total work done might not be very difficult.
If Bitcoin Clashic gains even a tiny market share; enough that it becomes "profitable" given the EDA; then it is possible that it attracts more hashpower than BCH and overtakes total difficulty.
In the same way the BCH has been plotting a "BTC death spiral" because it would be in BCH's best interests; it is in BTC's best interest to snuff out this malicious chain. I believe there is a reasonable risk that once the EDA brings difficulty down to a profitable level we will actually see it siphon miners from BCH (they seem to switch to whatever is most profitable regardless of politics) ; and then it would only take a few % of the Bitcoin hashrate from BTC mining to have more hashrate on Clashic than BCH. 
This situation is honestly so perfect it almost feels like a false flag.
We have a major disagreement over Bitcoin improvement strategies; Move fast and break things; vs highly conservative development.
So we get a rash fork with a poorly thought through DAA. Eventually that poorly thought through fork is forced to fork again to upgrade its DAA. BCH being a short lived and highly centralized coin would be one of the easiest coins to undergo a quick hardfork over something nobody deems is contentious.
But then even with this simple non-contentious "upgrade" it proves to be a security risk that opens up an enormous attack surface.
It almost feels like Ver is trying to demonstrate by costly example to the world why BTC's development strategy is the most wise. But more likely is just blinded by ego and simply don't understand the risks involved in forking.

They will not prevent another bull run, but will change the price discovery behavior.
The more of these financial products we have the more integrated Bitcoin becomes. 
The more of these financial products we have to allow more diversity of bets on the price; the more Bitcoins price discovery will stabilize, punctuated by brief periods of extreme volatility.
All these products tend to rubberband the price; causing it to bounce within a small range until the disparity between real supply and demand becomes so great that the market moves sharply to a new equilibrium that stabilizes for long periods of time.
Essentially we will see long stretches of stability followed by very brief but drastic changes in price.
Ultimately Bitcoins price is driven by supply and demand; and while Futures and other products can temporarily mask the true levels of supply and demand; over long stretches of time the disinflationary nature of Bitcoin dominates its price discovery.

All these points have been endlessly discussed. From the way your questions are worded/directed it appears you have been taken in by a deliberate misinformation campaign.
1)The block size limit was introduced by Satoshi; it is a security mechanism that limits spam on the blockchain. There are quite a few benefits to limiting the blocksize; lower orphan rates; lower resource costs to validate the blockchain, etc. Because Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central authority to make changes. Changing Bitcoin means convincing each and every person in the ecosystem to change. When it comes to money people tend to be conservative regarding consensus breaking changes. Essentially there are good reasons to keep the 1MB blocksize; and even if increasing blocksize was a good thing; it would have to be nearly universally seen as necessary in order for "Bitcoin" to increase blocksize.
2) Impossible to know; why would the masses be opening LN channels? The masses will initially purchase BTC via Lightning; they will spend via Lightning. The cost on the LN network will likely be miniscule and will approach the marginal electrical and bandwidth cost of a transaction over time.
3) Impossible to say; why would you assume regular people will want to settle to the blockchain? They will have the ability if they so desire; but most will not want the responsibility of being their own bank. If Bitcoin becomes the defacto global currency I'd estimate less than 0.01% of people will ever be knowledgeable enough to even desire to settle a TX to the blockchain itself.
4) Impossible to know
5) Yes LN is more decentralized than scam coins like bcash, why even ask this question instead of looking at publicly available information regarding miner diversity, node counts,  etc. No blocksize limit cannot be increased easily; nor can the total coin numbers.

Hard to say what Bitcoin will do. The masses certainly aren't going to flock to it without some massive PR campaign. Will the wealthy elite? Maybe some. 
It is nice to know that although the price could be manipulated the underlying asset cannot be. If you control your private keys you control unchanging stake in a finite network.
I don't think Bitcoin will trend down with the economy. I think most major holders will be situated well to handle the collapse, isn't that part of the reason Bitcoin was originally created? Smaller holders may need to liquidate to cover other losses. I would expect Bitcoin to trend sideways or upwards in the event of Global economic collapse.

Try to start one in practice and see what kind of backing you get.
Bitcoin is backed in part because it is finite. The potential rewards of the future incentivize people to act now.
If enough money was thrown behind such a system it could work, but in practice I don't see people investing time or money into a non-finite bitcoin.
What exactly is the need for indefinite rewards? If bitcoin is successful then the value will be high enough that the rewards and fee's will secure the network.

If it follows the trend we have been on we are looking at a rise to $8600 followed by "crash" to $5100 .
If we are going by previous patterns this would theoretically continue until we get to ~$75,000 and then crash down to $15,000 over 12 months; and then take another 18 months to recover to $75k before breaking $100k 36-48months from now.
Past doesn't predict the future; anything could happen in this market. Clearly we wouldn't still have our Bitcoin if we truly believed it would crash and burn; but there is a sizable probability that happens. There is no upside without risk; and the upside with Bitcoin is enormous; therefore so is the risk.

As long as enough hashpower is directed that a few blocks gets created; the EDA will kick in and lower the difficulty enough to make BCHEDA profitable. 
BCHEDA would need to have absolutely 0 market support for the chain not to split. Even if it has less price than dogecoin; as long as the market value is non-zero the chain will split and become profitable.
Unless there is a lower bound on the EDA? I don't believe there is.

Its not the same system as Bitcoin and I have a hard time believing it would have gotten the support necessary to get off the ground without the decreasing block rewards. 
The majority of the mining period being constricted to more or less a single lifetime creates an enormous incentive in people who realize the potential of this technology to support it with their time and money, because the payoff, in their lifetime, could be astronomical.
Its not that indefinite rewards don't work in theory, it is that we need the human incentive to get all this started.
If in 50 years from now the inflation rate is 2% the bitcoin economy still must grow at 2% just to maintain its price. It requires a much steeper and higher adoption rate in order to raise the price.
In just 17 years Bitcoin will have less than 1% inflation rate.
The value potential for an indefinite, non-decreasing reward schedule is lower and displaced into the future much further than a decreasing reward schedule. People are not interested in investing their time and money now on an experiment that might pan out 50+ years from now. The decreasing rewards gives us incentive to build this network as hard and fast as we can right now.

10minute block intervals are a design/security feature to help reduce orphans and chain splits.
LTC already has much faster block times and otherwise is basically the same as Bitcoin.
What you are suggesting is essentially that we fork to become Litecoin. 
Similarly the Difficulty is a major security feature of the protocol; artificially lowering it reduces the security of the network.

I was actually just entertaining this idea.
The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community. We all rally against the censorship and mods by running XT. Thus quickly settling consensus rather than dragging it out over months. Maybe. Maybe

Why would anyone trade their BTC for BCH?
If one believes that transaction throughput is holding Bitcoin back; why choose BCH over other coins with a much longer history of stable development and community support?
If somehow BTC is actually threatened by BCH there is no way in hell I'm trading BTC for BCH. 
I'm either going down with BTC or divesting into Alts. BCH is as offensive as USD to me.

The miners certainly have power; but I simply don't believe that in aggregate they would have the ability to resist the urge to make extra profits by buying up futures. If the futures start to rise I'll get more concerned ; but as of now I'm not really concerned miners are planning to coordinate a dump right after the fork.
It is possible miners have been taken over by government influences in one or more countries; but as much as I believe in conspiracies (and I do) I don't believe any are really as powerful or competent as they are sometimes made out. If they aren't compromised by banks/government then I suspect they will follow the money; and right now the money is saying if you mine B2X after the fork you will lose enormously every minute.

No you get financial sovereignty by running a node with rules you believe in. It has nothing to do with helping the community (though it does help) ; running a node principally benefits the node operator by ensuring that they operate on the network of their choice.
If you aren't running your own node you are trusting other nodes to verify network rules, transactions, and propagate your Tx. Nothing wrong with that; but running a node is not an altruistic behavior; it directly benefits the individuals who run them by allowing them to engage the Bitcoin network in a more trustless manner.

I'm not sure what your point is. Are you arguing against cold storage because it makes spending difficult?
You should have multiple levels of storage and security. Multisignature, paperwallets, hardware wallets, hot wallets. If you don't understand the idea of storing your BTC in small denominations in cold storage and then sweeping the desired amount to top off your hot-wallets, then I don't think you are ready to handle bitcoin.

I agree with you about the long run. In a 1000 years 50BTC per block is basically nothing. What I disagree with is the idea that you could get enough momentum behind such a system to get it running in the first place. The evidence for this view point is the non-existence of a secure blockchain with indefinite, non-decreasing reward schedule. If you think such a system is valuable you should pursue a fork of Bitcoin and convince the participants to move to your fork. If everyone agrees that this system is valuable it will move forward.
There is not enough incentive to get such a system running, as far as I am aware. Some miners may like the idea, but the value would absolutely plummet, which would knock out most miners and the system would fail.
An infinite reward schedule can not be properly secured and I'll hold that position until a secure blockchain with infinite non-decreasing reward schedule is created.

If it hadn't happened yet that might indicate that even poorly generated addresses have increased security when forged in a multisignature address. 
As it stands properly generating your addresses is critical and no amount of multi-sig can protect against non-random addresses.
Basically the question was "Can multisignature addresses mitigate the danger of using poorly generated addresses" and the resounding answer to that question is no.

The urgency is that we have ~1/3 to 1/2 full blocks with a userbase somewhere between 100k and 2million. Considering Bitcoin has gone through several adoption phases where the userbase has increased significantly in short periods of time, the risk is this:
If Bitcoin enjoys another adoption event before the lightning network, before block size is increased, the new users will be confused and angry that their money is getting "stuck." People will lose money and enthusiasm for digital currency. 
If lightning was available today it might be a different story, but there is no need to wait for disaster to strike to implement changes. People aren't going to be happy when their bitcoin transaction is tied up waiting for processing for several days, and they will be even more unhappy and confused when they are told the protocol is going through a major revision, and to just sit tight, and hope your transaction makes it to the right chain on the other side.
That is the urgency.

It depends on a lot of factors.
The route the block takes through nodes can vary and the speed of connections between nodes obviously varies significantly as well.
4mb block data needs to find its way to ~100,000 peers within 10minutes. The time can vary wildly depending on routes and connection speeds.
We already have issues where miners are clustering together and nearby miners are creating their own networks to relay blocks to each other faster ; so we have already gone from individuals mining on PC's to large isolated mining centers; and now those mining centers are congregating geographically into clusters. 
Faster block times just mean more clustering; which eventually will make it easy for governments to stomp them out.

I don't think Bitcoin is in a Bubble; but correction is important to prevent bubbles.
When we corrected from $5k to $3K it scared away a lot of weak hands and created a lot of bagholders in the $5k range.
Those bagholders should start to freak out as Bitcoin breaks into the low $6K and entice them to take profits now or else. This will cause the price to tumble ; but as it approaches $5k they will slow down to avoid "losing"
If on the other hand it breaks right through $5k; those holders will panic sell and then we could very well see a tumble into $3k and below.
If we hit $3000 then I have a feeling that Bitcoin will be on a long down trend until the next halving.
We already tested $3000 a couple times; if we break below it I think we will have to find a new bottom much lower.
All is possible with Bitcoin.

If we go below 200 it might be crashing. This is just noise after the correction from 315. There is some uncertainty being presented by the MSM, but Bitcoin is a long term game and I doubt informed major investors are too bothered by a spat between some people who have contributed code. Bitcoin was designed to handle these sorts of events, and these sorts of events have been predicted for years. That said it is an experiment that could fail at any moment, but the same could be said for all of modern civilization.

Certainly; but a lot of people think of running a node as purely an altruistic behavior that costs the individual user resources (bandwidth, CPU, electricity, disk space) without providing anything in return.

As Bitcoins are lost, the remaining Bitcoins become more valuable. Naturally as the value of an asset increases more precaution is taken to protect it. 
For instance when BTC were worth less than a penny it was not uncommon for people to have hundreds or thousands of BTC in their hotwallet. This made it possible to lose those hundreds or thousands of coins at a time due to mistake. As value increased people began separating their funds into cold storage and hot-wallets. Losing a thousand BTC at $0.01 is not much of a loss, but losing a thousand BTC at $300 is an enormous loss.
Essentially, bitcoins will be lost over time, and as they do the increased value of the remaining coins will be more carefully protected. Over time I expect less and less coins to be lost. Though we are still in the beginning stages.

A way to think about this is that all these fee's sitting their is providing a real financial incentive to produce Layer 2 + 3 solutions.
People don't work for free generally; particularly extremely skilled and knowledgeable people.
With all these fee's sitting on the table; that is real money up for grabs. It isn't a hypothetical; it is real. 
So that incentivizes people now to work on solutions so they can get a piece of that pie.
If we increase blocksize the worry is that even with more transactions the sum total of the fee's will be less; providing less incentive for developers to work on 2nd layers.
Right now the fee's are like a bug bounty. Whoever can figure out how to implement a good scaling solution first will be able to start collecting some of those fee's.

Why do 10minute block times matter? As I mentioned this is important for maintaining global consensus as well as decentralization. 
Cryptocurrencies are a network that must be in sync in order to function.
Consider a hypothetical extreme example of a chain where 1 block is created every second. Blocks must be propagated globally so that everyone stays in sync. If a miner on one side of the world gets lucky and generates 4 blocks in a row before they propagate to the other side of the world; but the miners on the other side of the world generate 3 blocks in a row before their blocks propgate; suddenly you have two chains that are not in agreement. The longer chain will become dominate and all those transactions in those 3 blocks get wiped out.
This sort of chain split could go on much longer than 3 or 4 blocks; particularly if miners wanted to try to attack the network; they could withhold blocks to be released at a time to cause optimal damage (or to reverse some of their transactions)
The quicker the block intervals are; the closer together miners need to be to reduce the risk of splitting the chain or wasting resources on an orphan chain. 
There are plenty of blockchains that believe Bitcoin's interval is too long; if you agree then you should back those blockchains instead.
I highly recommend you learn more about the underpinnings of Cryptocurrency ; a good starting point would be Khan Academy for Bitcoin 101 and some basics on modern cryptography. 
Then I would recommend to get an understanding of some of the issues of the current financial system with "Flash Boys" or "The Big Short" 
From there I would recommend Nassim Nicholas Talebs series ; Blinded by Randomness, Black Swan, and Antifragile.
Then I would dive into reading about the history of private money and bank money in the US and throughout the world; as well as the history of fiat money.

The total limit is one of the main factors that drives value and incentivizes the miners to mine. Look at the hashrates of altcoins that have an infinitely inflating currency compared to Bitcoin. Even dogecoin doesn't inflate at its original reward subsidy continuously.
Speculation is just a natural human behavior, and bitcoin takes advantage of this to secure its network. Yes it could fail, but it also helps create a positive feedback loop.
I would be interested in proposals that took coins away from the future to incentivize nodes in a PoS format. Where maybe instead of going from 3.125 BTC per block to 1.6525 BTC, we jump down to 0.78125 BTC per block.
This would give us 164,000 BTC to distribute to nodes right now. To receive PoS compensation, the nodes would need to put up a minimum stake to prevent spoofing, like 0.25 BTC. This 164,000 is put on its own block reward halving cycle. 
Initially ~0.4BTC per block (and halved every 210,000 blocks) distributed to nodes as a percentage of their stake. So a node with 1BTC staked in a sea of 1000 nodes each staking 1BTC would receive  0.001 * 0.4BTC = 0.0004BTC per block. Times 144 blocks per day = 0.0576BTC. That is 1.728BTC per month. This could incentivize a much larger number of nodes. The stake return may need to be capped to prevent significant holders from gobbling up all the reward on a single node. So we could cap the stake return for individual nodes at 0.1% or 0.01% to ensure at least 1,000 or 10,000 nodes can compete for stake.

While I agree it is unlikely; I think change can happen a lot faster than people believe.
There are certain scenarios that certainly could lead to Fiat being obsolete in 5 years.
For instance; if a large portion of the global population had their identities compromised it could lead to a loss of confidence that completely destroys fiat money.
If a database that contains all your personally identifying information were hacked or leaked to the world; then any criminal anywhere could open a line of credit in your name.
What would happen if this happens to 100Million+ people? How would banks be able to tell what are legitimate charges and which are not?
Criminals would take advantage of the non-reversibility of Bitcoin and take out loans and other credit in their victims names and purchase Bitcoin with it. Some unscrupulous individuals will claim they have had their identity stolen when they haven't.
So what can be done? Banks could restrict the use of credit to be only used on purchases that can be reversed. But how many transactions can really be reversed if they are bought by anonymous criminals?
Your identity is stolen, criminal on other side of country opens a CC in your name. They go on a shopping spree. Eventually you find out when your credit is wrecked. How can the transactions be reversed? The bank can take the money back from the stores; but now those stores have been punished. Criminal gets their stuff; and the businesses that accept credit are punished.
If that happens, suddenly credit will not be accepted everywhere. It will be accepted less and less.
Then we also have to consider; if this were to happen confidence in the banking industry as a whole will be diminished. Banks will start tightening credit to prevent these thefts; which will promote an economic downturn.
All this is going on while Bitcoin continues to show that it is an uncorrelated asset. People start noticing that Bitcoin just keeps rising. $10k, $15k, $30k ; after years of Bitcoins value continuing to rise and fiat value continuing to fall there will be a breaking point; the reverse of a Bank Run.
Suddenly the price starts rising astronomically. Nations around the world take notice. "Why are we holding these USD notes in reserve when their value continues decreasing and the threat of US default continues increasing?"
Then Saudi Arabia in a deal with China and Russia announces they will sell oil for Crypto. 
Suddenly the world has changed. People will laugh at you if you try to spend these green pieces of fabric.

This is in my mind proves 2X was a malicious attack to undermine public confidence in Bitcoin.
2X was supported by 90% of miners and many big name Bitcoin companies. If we hadn't stuck to our NO2X guns then 2X would have proceeded with the vast majority of hashing power behind it. 
Suddenly Bitcoin which has had no real downtime since its inception is broken; blocks aren't being found or relayed. Panic is in the air; what is going on? Oh this one developer is scrambling to put out an untested patch; everyone quick and update!
It would have decimated confidence in Bitcoin.
Every single company that supported 2X needs to come out and admit that supporting 2X was a mistake and lay out a roadmap for how they will deal with future forks.
For instance I want all these companies to say something like "After witnessing major vulnerabilities in the 2X chain we now know that our support for 2X was dangerously misguided. In the future any hard fork will be viewed with extreme skepticism and to garner our support any HF upgrade must be included in client software at minimum 1 year prior to activation."

I can and have used Bitcoin for years. Use it to accept payments, purchase equipment + materials for my 3D Printing business for years. Can buy pretty much anything with Bitcoin if you know how, and with a decent discount over fiat. 
I agree that a huge drop in price is probably in Bitcoins near future; but not because it is overvalued. If anything Bitcoin is undervalued even at $10k. That is why it goes through such spikes and crashes. It goes a long time undervalued; then major players move in unison to bring it up to value quickly; then the public FOMO's and pushes it higher; before crashing and remaining undervalued.

While some use cases are untenable at the moment due to transaction fee's; I'm constantly reminded of this Yogi Berra quote
"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded"
Bitcoin transaction fee's are rising because people continue to value blockchain space on the Bitcoin blockchain as being more and more valuable. 
People are paying $5 and $10 because they feel it is worth that much. When the fee's rise too high; they will stop transacting. The fee's will then either fall to meet demand; or demand will continue driving the price of fee's up.
Think about it this way: Most people involved in Crypto also have bank accounts, cash, paypal, credit cards, etc. There are many ways for Bitcoin holders to make inexpensive payments.
Yet people continue to spend more and more for transaction space in the Bitcoin blockchain. 
People just aren't transacting with BCash; their blockchain is basically empty; and whenever they do get a surge of transactions; their fee's get just as high as Bitcoin fee's
I believe that fee's should become the dominant form of revenue for miners ; the sooner the better.
When miners are dependent primarily on the reward subsidy there is greater problems with centralization during the halving events.
If the price does not double in a short time frame around the halving events it threatens to put smaller less profitable miners out of business ; centralizing mining in fewer and fewer hands. 
When fee's become the dominant revenue stream for miners; the block halvings will not be events to raise much concern.

Ethereum is a really cool tech; I have some; but it is in no way a competitor to Bitcoin.
Ethereum is not money; it is a decentralized internet computing resource.
Crypto-Tokens are not all Cryptocurrencies; and there is not a single serious competitor to Bitcoin.
Ethereum is not competition; it can never be money or a store of value; but it can be very useful for certain applications.
Ethereums development approach is to move fast and break things; while Bitcoin's approach is much more conservative.
At such a critical juncture in Bitcoins history when we are faced with the choice to HardFork to increase Bitcoins attack surface in exchange for reduced fee's ; events like this are highly relevant to Bitcoin.
This is not a strawman; it genuinely demonstrates the wisdom in the development approach in regards to Bitcoin vs. Ethereum. 
I genuinely wish Ethereum does well (like I said I do have some) but not because it is "superior to Bitcoin" ; but because its scope and Bitcoins scope are almost completely different.

That is certainly an interesting way to look at things.
You do realize that Blockstream employees are a small subset of "Core" contributors? "Core" is a repository developed by a large number of contributors; several of which employed by Blockstream.
If Blockstream were a malicious entity (which I think is laughable) what power is it do you believe they hold over Bitcoin?
Do you really believe that Blockstream and Blockstream alone is responsible for 1Mb blocks? That literally everyone in this $100Billion industry wanted to upgrade but because a dozen or so coders didn't want to that was enough to stop the will of $100Billion?

Called it a few days ago but my posts were downvoted both here and in rBTC
This is about to get very interesting. The EDA has just kicked in and should continue lowering the difficulty over the next few days.
Eventually the difficulty could be walked very far down; unless some miners decide to mine it for the purpose of preventing the EDA from continuing.
Anyways if the difficulty is walked down to say 0.01% of current difficulty over the course of a few weeks; it would then be quite possible for Bitcoin Clashic block height to overtake BCH.
The EDA limits the adjustment to a maximum of 4x at every 2016 block interval.
So 0.01% even if 2016 blocks are mined in 10minutes would only adjust to 0.04%; then 0.16% ; 0.64% ; 2.5% ; 10%.
So they could mine 10,000 Blocks in a short amount of time before the difficulty gets close to the current BCH difficulty.
If the BCH network is not properly upgraded there is wipeout risk.

No. I'm not going to spend my Bitcoin on toys.
I got into Bitcoin as part of my personal sustainability initiative. If Bitcoin makes me wealthy I will use that to create a "seed of civilization"
 1000 acre forest with 100 acres cleared in the middle 
Solar, Wind, and Geothermal powered
Propane + Natural Gas "battery"
Excess solar and wind power is used to mine Bitcoin ; profits from Bitcoin used to buy Propane and maintain the power infrastructure (batteries, conduits, transformers, etc)
The goal would be to produce 10-100x as much power as I consume. Excess for Bitcoin mining and eventually to power the small community.
Drill wells and practice permaculture throughout 90% of the acreage. Intensive/traditional farming on the other 10%
Build all structures out of stone + concrete 
Practice sustainable living; produce as much food, water, electricity, and everything else that we can competently.
Spend my days with my created community, moving projects forward, lots of time for reading, writing, and thinking.
If successful; leave behind a legacy. If not successful I still lived my dream.
Either that or use the money to fuel my 3DPrinting business and build it out into a larger entity. Stress and satisfaction of working on projects for other people is different from the stress and satisfaction of completing your own self directed goals. Both seem important for balance.

That was painfully stupid to listen to. I mean it is a fine starting point to talk about currency being based on trust; but he stopped right there and didn't even think through his position any further.
His main point in the first video is that currency is based on Trust; and that you can go to places all around the world that "trust" the USD or "trust" the Euro; but very few places can you spend Bitcoin. He then brings up notes used during the civil war in the confederacy and says "you can't get anything at Chick-fila with these because the trust is gone"
If those are his only two points he is severely lacking in thorough analysis.
He is able to understand that fiat currencies have collapsed to 0 because trust is lost. He is able to understand that Bitcoin is still a very small ecosystem.
So he concludes that because Bitcoin's ecosystem is small that means nobody trusts it, and therefore it is destined to fail. 
That might be true of an established fiat currency dictated by a nation state; but why would a brand new free-market currency have widespread adoption overnight? In what world does something get created and immediately go from 0 trust to 100 trust?
The question was presented by a 17 year old kid with $2000 saved up; not a 55 year old trying to figure out how to plan for retirement.
If any class of people should be encouraged to invest in Crypto it should be young people with small amounts of money. Crypto is extremely risky; but it is clear that Ramsey isn't avoiding it because it is risky; but because he simply does not understand it.
For a 17 year old that has their whole life ahead of them; risking $200-$2000 on Crypto is not reckless.
The biggest risk you can take in life is to not take any. I'm not saying YOLO ; but calculated risks based on your understanding and beliefs (not get rich quick dreams) are important for human growth and development.

Bitcoin mining is one of the best uses of energy on the planet.
Do you realize how much resources are wasted building banking infrastructure around the world? How much is wasted feeding and clothing and house and entertaining bankers? How much fuel is used driving back and forth? All that CO2 they put into the atmosphere while they leach off the rest of society.
And then think about how much is wasted because of the fraudulent credit system. Billions of people working meaningless jobs to create a bunch of crap nobody really needs but everyone has to keep the house of cards up by spending spending spending.
Our whole global economy is insanely wasteful precisely because the monetary system is not tied down to physical resources.

Precisely; and the direction that Bitcoin is taking is to preserve those features which differentiate and make it better than legacy banking at all costs.
BCH has chosen to accept increasing centralization pressures in exchange for less expensive payment processing. If BCH actually ends up having transactions take place on the network; they will run into the same issue again very soon and need to increase the blocksize. Blocks will need to be extremely large to scale to global adoption levels; which does mean a highly centralized network.
Furthermore; without a fee economy; BCH will more likely run into problems of miner centralization at each halving event and price downturn. When the halving occurs; or the price dramatically reduces; mining operations centralize towards the largest and most profitable. Fees will likely become the dominant source of revenue for miners around the next halving on BTC but not for BCH.
Eventually as mining rewards dwindle from future halvings and price appreciation rate decreases after mass adoption; without high fee's it will likely be necessary to stop the halvings and allow the reward subsidy to continue indefinitely. 
So I agree with your points on what makes Crypto better; but I strongly believe that BCH compromises all of these.

That is not my conclusion; but you are free to conclude that. 
Fee's continuing to trend upward shows more and more demand for actual Bitcoin transactions.
There are thousands of competing Cryptos most of which have almost 0 fee's. Why are people paying $10 for a Bitcoin transaction when they could use one of these other coins? Are they stupid?
The truth is that the actual value of blockchain space on the Bitcoin blockchain is rising.
Paypal already has infinite block space. The properties of Bitcoin is what makes Bitcoin transactions valuable compared to other transaction networks.
Do I want lower fees? Absolutely. Am I willing to sacrifice the revolutionary properties of Bitcoin so that I can use Bitcoin for small purchases? No.

Much worse to have the bank/government censor your ability to buy a home, transportation, or tell you where you can/cannot send money.

Of course the general public will never be able to interface with the bitcoin protocol themselves. Anyone who is interested enough to learn the skills the enable the freeing aspects of Bitcoin will always be able to, but the general public will never learn to safely use Bitcoin directly.  Most people cannot change the oil in their car or even a flat tire, but they still use cars. 
The general public will keep their "dollars" in the bank, where the bank will use Bitcoin underneath to track and transfer the publics funds.
The general public will become poorer and poorer and those who understand FinTech will become richer and richer. This is not much different from today except anyone has the potential to get in on the ground floor of the developing FinTech rather sleaze their way to the top in the banking sector.

Bitcoin is a store of value that has always been volatile. It is also a transaction medium.
I've been accepting Bitcoin for years and I still provide 20% discounts for upfront BTC payment. Volatility really doesn't mean much to me, though I can understand why large merchants wouldn't want to accept it yet.
Something people don't realize is that you can send and receive Bitcoin without fee's when you do it off chain. 
If you are a merchant with a Coinbase account; and your clients have Coinbase accounts; they can send you Bitcoin without any fee's. This is obviously not the preferred state of things since we are then trusting Coinbase; but it is at least better than PayPal. When you get money via PayPal; WTF are you getting? You can at least withdrawal Bitcoin to your personal wallet through Coinbase.
You can also link a Debit card to a Bitcoin account; which allows you to spend Bitcoin effortlessly. Again; not ideal since we are trusting intermediaries; but it is great that these sorts of solutions can provide a stopgap until we get real scaling.
BTC is useful right now mostly as a store of value; to escape inflation; to escape corrupt governments, to hedge against the status quo. 
It will be more useful for payments as 2nd layer solutions develop; which will be in widespread use within 1 year from now. Already the vast majority of transactions take place "OffChain."

Its just so beautifully engineered. If only everyone with access to M0 had the same rights to fractional reserve lending as banking institutions the system might be more fair. I've always wondered why I can't make a loan to myself if I have 10% of the capital necessary for a purchase. But a bank can take that 10% make it 100%, force you to pay back 110% (or usually more) and if you fail they get whatever real asset + whatever has already been paid.

Yeah but if they are convinced that the solutions to their problems are something to be laughed at or derided or ignored they will continue their cycle. Most people feel taken advantage of but they don't think through the full cycle of action and consequence. Surprisingly a lot of middleclass people think that the homeless and the poor are the reason they feel taken advantage of. The "middleclass" is so helplessly enslaved that they look at the poor and homeless with contempt and jealously. If only the poor and homeless would work and pay taxes we could have a glorious society.
They do not see the systematic nature of the system. Most people believe that laws are passed in the best interests of the common person, and that when the law is interpreted in such a way that screws over the common person it was an "unintended consequence" that they couldn't have known it would be interpreted that way, BULLSHIT.
It is too hard to flip to the other side of the coin. That its not just the Russians or Chinese who are ruled by sociopaths, that authority almost everywhere in society has become sociopathic. That we are ruled by criminals and prisons are for low-level offenders and those who speak the truth. The biggest criminals run our governments and corporations. It is too painful to come to this conclusion and so people reject it outright. Even if most people have no problem understanding Mexico is run by criminals, they couldn't conceive it happening in America. I don't know when the takeover occurred, sometime in the 20th century, maybe even the 19th century, maybe we never had anything other than a facade of freedom to begin with.
And even ignoring the sociopathic nature of authority, we as a species have not elevated in consciousness in the same way we have elevated our technical abilities. We have power over Earths resources in a way we never had, yet we behave as if we have infinite resources on this planet. Without reconciling our economic systems with our finite planet, we will exhaust critical resources unexpectedly which will result in trade breakdowns, ultimately resulting in a great starvation event. Less than a billion people will likely survive.

Inflation makes borrowing less expensive.
Do you mean to say increased interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduces inflation?
 I would agree that this has often been the case; but what we have right now is banks that are hoarding hundreds of billions in cash that they haven't been lending out since the last crisis. We've been printing cash as fast as we can while maintaining zero interest rates. Who in their right mind wants to credit a loan at near 0% when they know they are losing to inflation as well as the risk of default?
 As interest rates rise across the board there is greater incentive to lend; and less incentive to borrow. Just like in the before 2008 we are going to see loans available to anyone and everyone.
It is going to start off as a massive economic boom until it becomes apparent that there is no boom; just inflation. When Rent and Supermarket prices catch up to Wall St.

From my understanding, as an open platform it will enable business models to flourish that wouldn't be profitable with the fee structure on ebay and other marketplaces.
Ebay for instance, is a great marketplace as a consumer, but can be a headache and be very costly for the seller. In some cases the consumer ends up paying indirectly for the convenience offered by insuring transactions.
By creating a neutral marketplace with various levels of arbitration, consumers and sellers can pick and choose what kind of arbitration they desire/need.
For instance, because Ebay by default provides all consumers a very high level of convenience and security it creates an incentive for consumers to behave fraudulently. Claiming items are damaged, not received, and other various claims will almost always find Ebay siding with the consumer which when done fraudulently can put people out of business. Small business operators that don't have the funds to deal with fraudulent returns can simply determine their own return policy. They might get less sales, but a small business is better off getting less sales with no returns rather than have the liability of any sale being returned.

The existence of Bitcoin only darknet markets proves that Bitcoin is a different kind of money; a money that you ultimately have control over. 
So while on the one hand its association with the Darknet may be a negative for mainstream adoption; Darknets are absolutely essential for Bitcoins reputation as a stateless, permissionless, money.

It is incredible to see it so openly written out like that.
Why do so many people consent to giving the State blanket authority over every aspect of humanity? 
I guess I can understand if people believed that the State was a force for good in the world; but how the fuck can people believe that in 2017. 
People will openly admit corruption is rampant. They will openly admit that China, Russia, South America, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East act in their own bureaucratic/imperial interests; but that the US and Europe are somehow different. Nothing wrong with the system; we just need to get "our" guy in office and that will fix everything. 
A US Governor poisoned an entire City for profit and the US cannot mount a response. No real recovery effort is underway for the City of Flint and no real prosecution of the decision makers involved. Children have died and many have been rendered mentally retarded as a result. No consequences.
But we have ample resources to go to war with a country because its leader is poisoning its own people.

Here is my opinion, even though nobody asked for it.
Coinbase is a Bank that allows you to sell fiat for bitcoins and holds deposited bitcoins and some fiat. Coinbase is a Bank that will allow you to withdraw your fiat or bitcoin as bitcoin or fiat (via bank transfer).
Coinbase is a Bank that also hosts a Bitcoin wallet that you can control (the Vault) but your default wallet should be considered a Bank Account.
Coinbase is a new kind of Bank that sits between the legacy financial system and decentralized crypto-currency networks. Of course it is subject to regulations.
There is nothing stopping people from opening up their own unlicensed, unregulated exchanges, so why don't we see more of them? 
Because who wants to invest the time and capital into developing something that can be seized at a moments notice? For this reason unregulated, unlicensed exchanges will have a much higher premium to account for the increased risk of operation or the exchange is likely to operate on some kind of ponzi scheme or scam. Why work hard and risk everything you work for if you aren't even getting paid? 
It is the overarching regulatory system that causes this friction. If there were no Coinbase we would all be forced to use services with a much higher premium and/or higher likelihood of being scammed out of our money.
Attacking Coinbase will not make regulations go away. It is good to be reminded that Coinbase is a bank and not a true Bitcoin wallet, but I haven't closed my bank account and I'm not closing my Coinbase account simply because they comply with regulations. It is not about one or the other. We need stepping stones to wean us off the fiat addiction.

If anyone still believes in innocent until proven guilty they are in for a rude awakening.
Between Snowden and other leakers we know that "they" are compiling a database of every infraction of the law you ever make. If you ever step out of line or make yourself a profitable target; you are done. Even simple things like a record of your driving habits could be used to destroy your career or reputation.
School teacher of a small town suddenly becomes a target due to supporting certain political candidates. Turns out that if you tally every time this person has driven 1MPH over the speedlimit in the past 10 years; that adds up to hundreds of infractions. Should such a reckless driver be responsible for the safety of our youth?
We live in a reality where you must assume that every piece of data that you generate or can be generated about you; can and will be used against you; out of context; in the worst way possible. 
It is safer to produce as few signals as possible; and to consciously curate your dossier.

I'd be interested to see how this will work. It can't really be permissionless if only authorized banking partners can issue Billon.

I don't want to get into false analogies here; but it is not always possible to have a polite and civilized debate. There is nothing to debate. If a person does not understand AntBleed/ASICBOOST they have no place "debating"; if they do understand AntBleed/ASICBOOST and they support/defend it; they are enemies of Bitcoin. Plain and simple.
You can support alternative clients, alternative scaling proposals, alternative development teams; but the second a person supports backdoors and mining efficiency gains at the expense of transaction processing; they are an enemy of Bitcoin. They probably aren't paid shills; but there is little difference.

So who is running a Bitcoin deficit? Who is in Bitcoin debt?
Your example doesn't make sense. You absolutely can have people increase their account values without people running a debt.
You are confusing debt with spending. If I have $10 and spend $5, I'm not running a $5 deficit. If I have $10 and spend $5 on tools or materials that allows me to create something that is sold for $20 who is running a deficit? 
I spend $5, now I only have $5
I use labor and ingenuity to transform $5 of materials into something someone else values at $20. They buy it because they apply their labor and ingenuity to it and create something worth $100.
At the end of the day somebody ends up with $100 less but with something that is worth more than $100 to them and can possibly be resold for a similar value.
Wealth is created by labor and ingenuity. Money simply accounts for that wealth. Nobody must be in debt in order for people to get paid. People spend their capital in exchange for goods and services. People use their labor and ingenuity to create things of value that are traded for capital which those people then use to buy more goods and services.
Debt is unnecessary, as global wealth increases from applied generations of human civilizations labor, the value of the monetary unit increases. 
Debt is not necessary for wealth accumulation. Debt is not necessary for individuals to increase the numbers in their account.
Debt is only necessary if you for some reason feel that the numbers in EVERYONEs account should increase. Why? Why do the numbers in the accounts need to increase? If we get rid of inflation, the monetary unit simply increases in value in lock-step with free-market driven demand.
The premise that it is good or necessary for the numbers in peoples accounts to increase as a whole is something I disagree with. I see no reason simply increasing these numbers while decreasing their value is advantageous.

While I am certain they will be creating their own private blockchain (read database) ; I have a speculation that they will publish a hash of their blocks into OP_RETURN on the Bitcoin Blockchain at regular intervals.
A private blockchain certainly is much more vulnerable to many attack vectors than the public Bitcoin Blockchain; but if they publish a hash of everyblock then it would be obvious when a change occurs. In this way they can have their cake and eat it too. They get to maintain control over the currency that most people will use while leveraging the security of the public Blockchain. 
 I suppose the Bankchain would need their blocks to have a confirmation time within an order of magnitude of Bitcoins or they would produce too many transactions. They would probably use very large blocks with a 5min confirmation time, and then they would just need to publish 2 transactions to the bitcoin blockchain per bitcoin block. Pure speculation though.

People spend bitcoin, people earn bitcoin, people buy bitcoin. Nobody needs to be in bitcoin debt in order for people to save bitcoin.
People certainly could save money even if governments weren't in massive debt. Sure governments inflating the currency to make their debts easier to repay puts more dollars in circulation and allows people to more easily grow the number of dollars they own. Unfortunately the consequence is those dollars being worth less.

I think there are a couple reasons its price is increasing.
There is of course people chasing forked coins.
But I think due to the contentious fork the price is being increased as a way to bring more miners in and decrease the relevancy of CSW's pools. I can't see any way for Bitmain to not get what they want since they'll have 1million on any BCH fork (unless they blacklist his coins in the HF). So I'd imagine this pump is largely Bitmain pumping up BCH to bring in more miners to decrease the hashshare of CSW and Ayres pools.
It has the side effect of riding off the air-drop fomo; and if there ends of being a fork Bitmain can just dump the side(s) they don't like and pump it into the fork they want to preserve.
In the end; isn't it in the interest of producers of mining tools to have more assets that can be mined with those tools? If you were selling shovels it would be awfully convenient if you could also create mountains filled with veins of valuable ore.
I think we are going to see the profit motive push the forks to the limit. What is the smallest hashshare before 51% becomes likely? It would be interesting and useful to see how/when this plays out.

Here is another question for you to ponder:
Coinbase, the most regulated Bitcoin exchange in the US, has partnered with Purse. They cooperate to use a shared off-chain ledger. If Purse were such a hotbed of illegal activity as you claim, why has the most regulated and restrictive Bitcoin exchange integrated their offchain transaction solutions with them? The same Coinbase that monitors suspicious activity and shuts down suspicious accounts all the time allows direct transfers to Purse.

If you are significantly stressing over this recent drop and/or the BCH drama; you're probably over-invested.
Bitcoin is an incredibly ambitious experiment that is already changing the world; and yet has the potential to change it in far greater ways than we can even imagine today.
There are no guarantee's over the outcome of this experiment; but obviously most of us are here because something clicked when we learned about Bitcoin. It's not simply that Bitcoin's ambitions are good; but that the incentive systems setup that secure the network are elegant and revolutionary.
If you understand this experiment you understand that it has the potential to fail. If it didn't have the potential to fail the price would already be millions per coin.
All that said I think Bitcoin is here for the long haul. How low might it go? I don't know ; but the lower it is the more you can buy. The lower it is, the easier it is for the 1800 coins mined per day to get absorbed by the market.
Although Bitcoin prices can be manipulated by Whales; in the longer terms Bitcoin price is set by the market. It can only be kept up or down against the general trend for so long.
If Bitcoin goes down and stays down; that means this whole year of the price holding in the $6000's didn't really reflect the demand of the market. If thats the case the it was inevitable for the price to come down to sustainable reality.
On the other hand if the market throughout 2018 wasn't artificially kept up; that means that 1800 coins were being bought at market rate per day, plus those still selling their profits from the 2000% bull run.
If thats the case; then we'll see the market quickly take the price back to a higher equilibrium as buyers overwhelm sellers.
This market is still the wild west and it could do anything. That means we could still drop another 90%+ or go on a massive run. If you're throwing up over the possibility of losing it all; sell now. 
Otherwise butter your popcorn and enjoy the show.

* 3. Buy BTC through Coinbase/Circle/etc for +1.5%
* 4. Fund Purse order
* 5. Save; No shipping cost; Savings 20% - 1.5%; 18.5%
Do you know what the premium to buy physical Gold/Silver is? If you were to buy an Oz of physical gold, have it delivered, and then decide to sell it back, you'll end up receiving about 15% less than you started with. 
There are plenty of reasons people will pay above spot price. Certainly extremely high premiums are suspicious, but 10-30% is not unreasonable.
Just the other day I found out that my CC has been rewarding me with amazon gift cards just for making regular purchases. Free money. Except if I want to use it outside of amazon.

Scaling is being addressed quite well with SegWit. LN and other 2nd layers will prove themselves over time. There are issues certainly; but already the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions take place off-chain. If LN fizzles out that hardly is the deathnail for Bitcoin scaling. Bitcoin never came close to mainstream acceptance in December. Price =/= acceptance. The network was congested and fee's were very high; true; but much of that was not a result of increased mainstream acceptance. It was a combination of increased legitimate use as well as a well funded and coordinated spam attack. An attack which is now much more expensive to pull off now.
Everything else you mentioned are explicit features of Bitcoin; not problems.
Deflationary currency, limited supply are among the most highly valued features by many people involved with Bitcoin. 
Wealth inequality is reality and has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Fiat currency has allowed wealth inequality to skyrocket. Currency has nothing to do with wealth inequality. It doesn't matter if its Euro's, Peso's, seashells, or Bitcoins; wealth inequality is just the result of thousands of years of history built up. 
I think there is a strong case to be made that inflation is a primary driver of wealth inequality. While the wealthy and middleclass have funds they can put into investments and escape inflation; the lower classes work paycheck to paycheck. Suffering from sticky wages while prices of almost everything rises with inflation.

Bitcoin is a long term solution to the troubles of fiat currency.
The value will fluctuate wildly day by day, week by week, year by year; but over longer timeframes is decidedly disinflationary and over even longer timeframes deflationary.
If you understand the tech and believe that Bitcoin will continue to be relevant in the future; it is very difficult to imagine the price not rising astronomically over long time periods.
Of course there is no guarantee; but most of us are here because we believe in Bitcoins ability to save us from problems born through financial authorities such as inflation via central banking and transaction censorship as well as many others.

Thats exactly it. If you take a step back and look at Bitcoin over the years you see that its a story of ever increasing integration into global financial networks, both institutional and P2P.
Bitcoin started having no market value as a computer science project by cypherpunks and cryptographers.
Then it had a small market value; which then allowed it to be used for trade and created the darknet markets.
Then for a while it was seen as a commodity entirely in the realm of criminals; and this phase lasted several years.
Then over the past few years we've seen perception shift from anonymous criminal money to a disruptive Financial technology.
Until just a couple years ago exchanging Bitcoin for fiat was much more laborious. Now exchanges are peppered around the globe. 
Bitcoin is represented by ETN's and other financial investment instruments; Futures; and maybe soon "physically" backed futures.
There is no one thing Bitcoin is waiting on or needs to succeed. Its growing like a mycellial network from every tip and into every nook and cranny.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:29:41
I don't understand your point.
Taking profits is never "weak" and I don't think many here would argue that.
Buying high and selling low; even though the Bitcoin network itself has not changed, and future prospects have not changed, is weak.
Someone who buys an asset at a high price; and then panics and sells at a low price; even though nothing has actually changed with that asset; is the definition of a weak hand. They bought the asset simply due to greed and then sold the asset simply due to fear. That is absolutely weak. Its not an insult, its a description of a class of investors.
All of us want to make money; and many of us have bought Bitcoin in hopes of making money in the future. 
The difference is; many of us believe Bitcoin will rise in value due to its fundamental properties; not simply because its "popular" this week/year.
The weak hands buy Bitcoin not because they say "Wow the tech behind this thing is revolutionary, and based on my understanding I believe it will increase in value over long stretches of time"
"Wow that Bitcoin thing is making people rich, I want to be rich too"  
Those who are invested because they believe in their understanding of the Tech are much more likely to weather these storms than those who are here for short term gain. When Bitcoin starts losing money those in it for the short term are the first to bail because they don't have any rational to fall back on. They see it declining 80% in value and without understanding the fundamentals behind Bitcoin most people would say the party is over and sell their coins at a loss.
So yes; a person who Buys high and sells low purely because of market sentiment is a weak hand.

You fundamentally do not understand what you are talking about.
In your example the Chinese miners would have forked themselves off the network without censoring anything. You are not thinking through the actual steps.
In your example we need to start 1 block sooner; Block 49.
Block49 is found and nobody objects to transactions contained within. All miners begin working on block 50.
Honest miners find block50 containing an address china wants to censor; I'll use your nomenclature US50 to represent this block.
So now the blockchain looks like this:
China doesn't want that transaction; so they keep trying to mine block50 while the rest of the world is working on 51. Lets say they get lucky and find block50 before 51 is found. Now we have a chainsplit at block 49.
Honest miners have already gotten a head start working on US51 while attackers were working on C50; US51 would most likely be found ahead of C51. 
At this point the two chains are
Now Chinese miners risk being out of consensus and having all their blocks orphaned. They do not have the longest valid chain. C50; C51; C52 are literally not recognized by the network.
You are literally just making things up and hoping that not enough people can follow along. The only way transactions can be censored is with a runaway blockwithholding attack; which would be obvious and get the attackers cut off the network.
At great expense to themselves miners could delay transactions by purposefully orphaning blocks; but they can not indefinitely censor transactions without a 100% attack. 
In the example; even in the unlikely case that C51 is found before US51; there is a 49% chance that honest miners will find the next block and include the censored transaction.
At the end of the day transactions can only be indefinitely censored where there is a runaway 51% attack aka 100% attack. Which in that case would just get themselves banned from the network. It would be damaging in the short run; but in the end would cause the attackers a complete loss of influence.

When he was asked what got him interested in Bitcoin in the first place, he said he heard Falkvinge was investing and decided it sounded like a Ponzi then. He's decided it is his job to warn everyone that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or failed experiment.

The Earth is finite. What sense does it talk about the "collective" saving? 
Do you agree that the collective has access to more resources today than 5,000 years ago? 
Obviously the civilizations of the past had to dissave their resources to provide the increased resources we have today. /s
Your example is very confused. People create value through their work. Today's civilization has more; not because governments are in debt but because human labor and ingenuity creates value. That value adds up over time.
The idea that the only way for people to increase their wealth being through public debt is both wrong and offensive. 
People collectively increase their wealth through labor and ingenuity, not because governments go into debt.

Damn will people throw money at my blockchain project?
Basically I create blocks by a set of proprietary rules that is completely tamper resistant. 
The blocks are physically created by applying a proprietary blend of organic molecules to a processed cellulose surface. Once the block is formed we use a proprietary binding substrate that collects the blocks in groups of 250 for easy retrieval.
We recently had a breakthrough in our organic synthesis lab and have developed a proprietary solvent. Using this solvent we can strip away entries made on the processed cellulose sheets and apply new information.
Our technology will soon be the backbone of the global financial system, inquire for more info.

Bigger blocks could generate more revenue in fee's but it can also reduce revenue by the increased orphan rate.
The block size can be more safely increased once a balance is reached between the reduced revenue from increased orphan rates and fee revenue increase from increased transactions.
Once the blocksize is increased, fee's per byte will decrease. So the fee rate must build up higher now so that the fee market doesn't bottom out once blocksize is increased otherwise the increased orphan rate will incentive miners to not include transactions.

I agree with the first part, getting debt free and building an emergency account.
But after that by all means go 100% Bitcoin. Its not the most prudent investing strategy; but in the long run centralized investments are not less risky than Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is complete financial freedom.
Freedom is never "free" at least when it comes to personal responsibility. You cannot be free if you need others to be responsible for you. How can they be responsible for others without others surrendering some freedom over their behavior to those responsible?
With Bitcoin it is your responsibility and privilege to be your own bank.
Bitcoin is genius in that if you understand the system you have security far greater than any bank vault that has ever existed.
All you have to do is understand the basics of Public/Private key pairs and how to safely generate them. That knowledge gives you complete security and peace of mind over your Bitcoin. You don't have to trust anyone but your own understanding. There is obviously much more to Bitcoin than public/private key cryptography; but for practical use that is the most important aspect to understand.

I've noticed that the trendlines do not look very good right now.
However if trendlines were always prescient then we'd all be billionaires already. 
The market likes to surprise you just when you think you've got it figured out.
I'm a long term accumulator ; not a day-trader.
I have only traded some of my Bitcoin once in the past 4 years; and that was to purchase Real-Estate.
I use Bitcoin as a kind of savings account. Just always buying small amounts with excess funds. Even right now with the trendlines looking bad I'm still buying. If it was a good idea at $20,000 its still a good idea now. Maybe its a bad idea. My cut off for my investment strategy is around January 2022. 
I would advise everyone to make a plan and stick with it. Personally I think plans need to have hard figures around them to keep yourself honest. For instance my plan is something like X% gain by date Y ; else Sell ; until date Y buy $Z.
So if it hasn't reached X% gain by date Y I'll sell ; otherwise Bitcoins price is behaving within the bounds that I feel are healthy and will continue using it as a savings account.

I only see a ~$30 price difference between the two devices.
While I am very price conscious about many things when it comes to security or information security; choose the best option you can afford.
Also I wouldn't put all my eggs into one basket. What if your device gets intercepted along the way and swapped out with a counterfeit? There is a lot that is done to prevent these attacks; but using any HW wallet requires a certain amount of trust.
You have to trust the company that made it.
You have to trust that the company is not going to pull an exit scam
You have to trust that the company is competent
You have to trust the shipping carrier; you have to trust every single person that handles that package.
While these attacks are unlikely they introduce unnecessary trust into your Bitcoin storage.
Some of this Trust is eliminated when the HW wallet is open source; but not all of it.
If you know how to generate your keys on never online devices and know how to sign transactions on never online devices the ONLY way to lose your funds is by you giving out the private key / seed. 
If you're only securing a few million satoshi's you probably won't need to think about these unlikely scenarios; at least until Bitcoin hits $100k+.

If you are looking to hedge against price fluctuation, altcoins are not your answer.
Bitcoin and Crypto in general is extremely volatile, most of us believe that volatility will be upwards over the long term, but nobody knows.
You can't put all your money into Bitcoin and be exposed to the upwards volatility of Bitcoin while simultaneously protecting yourself from downwards volatility. If there was an investment scheme that offered riskless profit it would be a scam because it isn't possible. 
You could put USD on an exchange so that you are ready to buy Bitcoin at any moment to transfer out, but then you've replaced your trust in a bank to trusting mostly shady anonymous individuals.

What exactly is your point?
Bitcoin isn't meant to equalize wealth distribution. Bitcoin is a tool to escape political money. To escape inflation. To escape the corruption of central banks.
Individuals who have utilized this tool are reaping massive rewards. Its a completely voluntary system. 
In regards to it being a global currency; first and foremost Bitcoin is already a world currency. 
In terms of mass adoption; I could care less if governments force their citizens to use Bitcoin. In fact I'd prefer nobody be forced into Crypto.
Mass adoption (if it happens) will happen in stages. First slowly as individuals and institutions dip their feet in. Then more and more quickly. As the security of the network proves itself day after day and the value per coin increases year after year ; the number of people the desire Bitcoin grows. As the number of people who desire Bitcoin grows; the more merchants will accept it to get exposure. The more merchants accepting it and holding it grows the Bitcoin economy. This creates a positive feedback loop. The more merchants who accept it; the more utility there is (since you don't need to "cash out"). The more utility there is in Bitcoin; the more people will hold and spend rather than sell for fiat. The less people do that the more the price grows. Price growth causes more people to get interested and increase demand; causing further price growth. Over time the demand steadily increases while every 4 years approx the daily inflation rate (downward price pressure) halves.
In the end Bitcoin may or may not become a global currency. It has nothing to do with governments making decisions. Governments are all but powerless; they are illusions. The people always have the power. If Bitcoin becomes The Global Currency; it will be because individuals in every nation already hold significant amounts of it; and these individuals will of course pursue their self interest to find more ways to spend it. Governments will encourage its use and spread because greedy individuals within government will own it and pursue their self interest; even if Bitcoins spread is harmful to the power of government itself; individuals tend to pursue their self-interest at the expense of the whole.
That is why many of us feel Bitcoin has turned the tragedy of the commons on its head. Individuals pursuing their own self-interest will limit the power of the governments they work for by embracing Bitcoin.
So yes; if Bitcoin becomes the Premier One World Currency many current holders will be billionaires.
Obviously these scenarios are purely hypothetical and depend on quite a few factors; there are no guarantees with Bitcoin or anything in life; but many of us believe the properties of Bitcoin combined with human psychology creates a great opportunity for Bitcoin owners as time marches on.

Generally when the price is lower than the cost of mining the only reason one would continue to mine is the expectation of the price increasing. Why mine and sell for a loss? Better to shut down the mine and just buy Bitcoin directly. It only makes sense for miners to mine at a present loss if they are hoarding for the future. 
Hashrate growth may or may not be slowing; lets see what the next difficulty adjustment brings once it gets closer. It does appear to be on the downtrend; which makes sense as the cost of mining is approaching the cost of purchase.
I don't believe the Deathspiral will ever happen; I believe that Bitcoins decentralized and desired enough that even in the case of 90% of miners leaving the protocol will eventually recover. The problem is if 90% of miners leave all at once (unrealistic) we'll have 100minute block times and 20 week diff adjustments

While steady dependable growth is more sustainable the scarcity of Bitcoin combined with the low trade volume (compared to stocks and other financial instruments), make slow growth somewhat impossible right now.
Slow growth breeds confidence; confidence increases investments, short squeeze creates FOMO, FOMO drives more FOMO causing supply of coins to dwindle. This process goes on until the growth gets completely unsustainable; and then repeats this process in reverse.
As Bitcoin grows in marketcap, trade volume, and various financial products; it will stabilize the volatility. However it is a slow and gradual process; I wouldn't expect "low volatility Bitcoin" for another 10-15 years.

Seriously? Bitcoin is equivalent to base money. That is why it is most comparable to M0. M0 is the money that exists before it has been expanded through fractional reserve. 
Bitcoins themselves are M0. If Bitcoins could be used for fractional reserve, then Bitcoin bank accounts would be somewhat comparable to M1.
I never said the USD was the only currency, but it is the reserve currency of the world and the largest single comparison. 
There are about $1.1 Trillion (USD value) of Euro's in circulation. So Euro's + USD * 0.754% =  $19Billion

It could happen again.
People will be skeptical; just like they were after 2013. But here is how it could happen.
First it stabilizes over months maybe a year or two (lets say at $4k) Then it slowly starts rising. It makes modest gains over the course of another year; maybe 20% over the low. The next year it starts picking up a bit. 1% a month, then 2%, then 3%, 4%; by the end of the year its gaining over 10% month over month. But you're still skeptical. Bitcoin has done this before and at this point is just getting back around $8k. It starts picking up further; rising 10% week after week; and in just a few months breaks the ATH.
At this point people are wondering , whats going on? I thought BTC was dead? Maybe I should dip my feet back in just in case. Price doubles and everyone loses their minds; Bitcoin is of course going to $1Million! Everyone knows that Bitcoin can go way up in value way quickly! This time I'm not going to miss out!
Except this next time might be the last. The next super-cycle as I call it will be the black swan that flips the script. That's when Bitcoin becomes a global reserve currency; and fiat money exchange rate is measured in Satoshi's.

Why would institutional money artificially prop up the price before initiating a bullrun/FOMO? Institutions would be happy to short it down and accumulate at a lower price point before pumping it up; it would seem counter-intuitive to burn money to keep the price artificially high; except if the goal was to harm Bitcoin. If I were an institution that wanted exposure I'd have invested into mining during most of 2018 while simultaneously shorting BTC. Then when my fiat stack is big and my hashrate share is relatively high; and the BTC price the lowest I can sustainably short it; then pump it to the moon. But then again; I'm not at the helm of these institutions making decisions so what do I know.

You want multiple levels of security. 
Small amounts in an easy to access "Hot Wallet" on your phone or PC
Larger amounts in airgapped always offline MultiSignature wallets with geographically distributed private keys. 
Geographically distributed MultiSignature is the safest I can think of. You want to have multiple people you can trust so that there are multiple pathways to retrieving your coins. If one or two key holders become compromised or lost you don't want to lose access to your coins. You want to choose people who don't know (of) each other to hold different keys, to preclude the possibility of your friends and family conspiring against you.

This requires a conscious blockwithholding attack; its not something that can be passively done with 51%+ of the hashpower. It would be extremely expensive and not likely to succeed even with 51% of the hashpower, since it also depends on luck.

The news doesn't impact the price as much as people would like to believe.
Price changes and then people point to things in the news to try to make sense of it. Most of the time the fluctuations are simply supply/demand changing in a finite deliverable market. Often it is the result of coordinated pumps and dumps. Sometimes its the result of positive developments in the protocol or network.
Overall Bitcoin just does whatever Bitcoin does. 
If you understand and believe in the tech keep your eyes on technical parameters.
Hashrate, Difficulty, Mining Distribution, Node Count/Distribution, Blockchain transaction volume, exchange transaction volume, improvements to the protocol, new use cases, etc.
Segwit from the UASF resulted in an enormous price appreciation already last year. That is when the smart money recognized that Bitcoin was successfully scaling.
Coinbase adding Segwit is more just confirmation that the marketplace accepts this scaling solution; which certainly is good news; but the visionaries already saw this coming when the UASF was successful.
That said I do believe that we will see $100k+/coin by the end of 2020; possibly sooner.

Using a linux live DVD costs the price of a blank DVD ; or using a RaspberryPi is about $50.

Couldn't agree more!
Decimals seem intuitive to engineers, scientists, and people who work with numbers all the time.
I have been continuously shocked by otherwise intelligent peoples obsession with integer values.
I had family members and friends that had $1000 or more they wanted to buy Bitcoin with; but thought it was a waste of time unless they could own a full 1.0.
Even when I try to explain that there is no such thing as Bitcoins; just Satoshi's ; it doesn't seem to cause any kind of realization. People from outside Crypto simply assume it is non-divisible like stocks; or that buying smaller quantities results in large markup like buying tiny amounts of physical gold.
This causes so much confusion that would disappear if we just use Satoshi's. 
I have had more than my fair share of conversations about "There aren't enough Bitcoins for all the people in the world so it can never be a real global currency"

There is nothing "realistic" when it comes to Crypto predictions.
In 2016 anyone predicting that BTC would be $20k by the end of 2017 would have been (and were) considered insane and unrealistic.
Bitcoins price discovery is going to be chaotic and unpredictable. There are many people who believe Bitcoins final value is in the millions of dollars per coin; and many who believe its final value is $0. Its going to incredibly chaotic price discovery and nothing that happens will be considered "realistic" if predicted in advance. 
Anyone who has accurately "predicted" Bitcoins price discovery thus far has been called an unrealistic lunatic.
Bitcoin has been proving the supposed "realists" wrong for about 10 years now.
Could it take another 6 years; sure of course it could. I doubt it though. Crypto and Bitcoin in particular are more ingrained into the global economy than ever before and there are no signs that is slowing down. If you only pay attention to the price you might miss all the groundwork and infrastructure that has been laid down these past 18months. Compared to 2014 when the infrastructure was damaged from Mt.

Mining nodes can be identified and simply blacklisted from communicating with your node.
In the case where an obvious attack was occurring; like where a miner suddenly released dozens or hundreds of blocks which re-organized the chain; the source would have identifying information such as IP which can be blacklisted. 
They would of course be hiding behind proxies; but after a while of doing this it would most likely be ascertainable the responsible party by noticing which pools had dropped in hashrate in the days leading up to the attack. Hiding that much hashpower for a long period of time would be difficult.
Beyond that if the attackers didn't knock it off; a PoW change would most likely be suggested.

Banks are a fraudulent enterprise through and through.
They are terrified of being replaced by an open, transparent, and inclusive revolution in digital money. 
Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset. Everything about Bitcoin from the cryptography involved in digital signatures to the immutable blockchain is orders of magnitude more advanced than anything the legacy financial system has even conceived of. Not advanced because of its complexity; but advanced because of what it allows people to do with money, without intermediaries.
The banking system is genuinely threatened by the Cryptocurrency revolution. Things change a lot faster than a lot of people realize. We could see Bitcoin become the world reserve currency within 6 years; and I personal think this is a not insignificant possibility.

I just wish 2x was delayed by another 6-18months. I don't see an issue with the moderate blocksize increase; but I also don't think we should hard fork without a real emergency. Its a tricky game to play. Not being prepared for a future emergency could seriously harm Bitcoin; but setting a precedent of hard forking without existential threat to Bitcoin will just dilute it over time.
I think we need a hard line in the sand when increasing the Blocksize can be considered an emergency. 
I would propose something like this:
If reward subsidy = 12.5 BTC ; Emergency = &lt; 76% Block Revenue from fee's
If reward subsidy = 6.25BTC ; Emergency = &lt; 88% Block Revenue from fee's
If reward subsidy = 3.125 BTC ; Emergency = &lt; 94% Block Revenue from fee's
We need fee's to replace the reward subsidy over time; so it makes sense that as fee's rise above a threshold defined by the block subsidy that this would be one of the few objective measures that we could point to and say 
"now raising blocksize does not risk mining stability" and at these fee % levels many Bitcoin users (maybe even overwhelming consensus) will agree to hard fork. 
So if the total revenue from fee's exceeds 76% of the total block revenue during this 12.5 BTC subsidy period; then I think we could get support for a blocksize increase. Maybe decided by the median % from the last 2016 or even ~4000 blocks to help prevent it being gamed.
Right now that would be ~40BTC / block in fee's

With a sample of 7Billion people there will certainly be quite a few people who get consistently lucky their entire lives.
If you start with a pool of 100,000 traders and each year the unprofitable traders are cut. Just for easy math say 50% make gains; and 50% make losses so the pool of successful traders is cut in half every year.
After about 15 years you end up with ~10 traders who have never had a bad year for 15 years in a row. All luck.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes even a very long track record of success in trading can still be a result of luck.

Could you elaborate on the pattern you've identified?
Hashpower tends to follow price increases; so it makes sense that miners have re-invested; but it is still just so staggering when you look at the big picture.
I might not be very clear; up until about 48hours ago the average block generation time was almost exactly 10minutes (unless the data on Bitcoinwisdom was wrong which is a strong possibility); since then blocks were generated fast enough to lower the average of 2016 blocks to 8mins 14seconds. That is a lot of hashpower coming online very quickly.

If that is the case you'll probably be best suited to wait for this to be addressed rather than going to the bank. 
Coinbase may think that the "rightful owner" and you are different people. They may think that the "rightful owner" claimed their account was hacked and that you, the hacker, are trying to get around them locking down the account.
If your money was already transferred to Coinbase then there is really not much your bank can do. If your funds are in Limbo then the bank may be a good resource.

Bitcoin news from 2009 to 2016 was almost a complete laughing stock. Nearly every article called Bitcoin a scam, a farce, the money of criminals, etc.
Bitcoin had no issue rising from nothing to $1000 in the face of overwhelmingly negative "news"
"News" is almost always a distraction or a psychological trap. Anyone who needs to be told what is happening and why by talking heads isn't going to be driving the market.
While I agree that "news" can spur on FOMO or can deepen a crash with FUD; in the long run I think Bitcoin will succeed even if the "news" becomes overwhelmingly negative.

The critical issue is that the hashrate does not adjust every 2 weeks; it adjusts every 2016 blocks to make the average block interval 10minutes.
So in a worst case scenario where 95% of miners leave right after a difficulty adjustment; it will take 20x longer to generate each block; meaning 40weeks until the next difficulty adjustment. That would be nearly a year with extremely slow blocks; it would be very damaging for Bitcoin. In this scenario after a few weeks there would most likely be a hardfork to correct the difficulty or POW change to punish the miners for leaving.

Need might be a strong word; but to answer your question "Why work for Bitcoin?" it is a multi-sided answer.
Working for Bitcoin is for your own profit and peace of mind. If you believe in Bitcoins long term potential and want to invest but aren't wealthy enough to plop down $20k+ and be able to watch it swing down 80% ; working for Bitcoin is much safer and easier for peace of mind. 
The other reason that we should be "working for Bitcoin" is that at the end of the day human directed labor is what creates value. A growing economy of people that accept Bitcoin in exchange for their labor gives real value to the currency. Over time people working for Bitcoin translates into more goods and services being offered in exchange for Bitcoin. The more that you can buy directly with Bitcoin; the more valuable Bitcoin becomes; because you don't have to cash out to use it.
Another big reason that we should be "working for Bitcoin" is because that is necessary for the End-Game.
Bitcoin will always be mined (at least for another 100+ years). There will always be a downward pressure on the price from new coins entering circulation. Although inflation as % of market reduces enormously over time; there is still a downward pressure on price from new coins. The goal in the end game is that those working for Bitcoin create the real value in the world that is represented by the new coins minted by miners.
Wealth/value doesn't come from thin-air. Money represents the real value in the world. The more people that exchange their goods and labor for Bitcoin the more valuable the entire concept becomes.
Bitcoin gained in price over 2017 ; but not significantly in value. Bitcoin had been massively undervalued and 2017 was a bit of new price discovery. 
As Bitcoin becomes more ingrained and integrated into the internet and global economy its real value will grow. History has shown us that the price does not keep even step with the networks value. The price goes long periods being undervalued; then moves up sharply a few legs; then moves up asymptotically; then crashes down 50-80%. While it is crashing down in price; network value grows; and then it suddenly starts popping in the other direction.
A lot of the timing of these events I believe is correlated strongly to the halving events. The past does not predict the future; but thus far the insane % gains have all started ~6months post halving.

You keep asserting that 51% of miners can successfully censor transactions on the network without a blockwitholding attack and at this point I'm going to call you a liar. I've explained the mechanics necessary in order to censor transactions and you keep repeating the same ignorant nonsense.
So lets walk through a hypothetical example to demonstrate your ignorance.
China wants to censor Transaction A "TxA" 
China mines block 1 excluding TxA
Honest miners mine block 2 including TxA
China now has a 51% chance to re-mine block 2 without TxA before honest miners find block 3. But as soon as honest miners find block 3; it wipes this out. So China needs to re-mine block 2; and mine block 3 before honest miners. The chance for this happening is 51%*51%= 26%.
All this work and 74% of the time your blocks will end up being orphaned by honest miners. 
74% of the time you will fail to censor transactions; which is utterly useless. If a transaction is important enough to command 51% of miners to censor it; the transaction will simply be resubmitted if it gets knocked out of an orphaned block.
In the end the attackers gain nothing. They can spend a lot of money to slow unwanted transactions; but they completely lack the ability to censor transactions without a runaway blockwithholding attack; which would be extremely obvious and cause them to be banned from the network.
Educate yourself on the technical details before spouting off your ignorance so confidently.

ICO's never had a chance.
Why should any company spend millions on lawyers to be compliant with SEC regulations to launch an IPO when they could just launch an ICO with no hassle?
The Bitcoin Network can shrug off regulations and regulators ; but individuals and companies cannot simply use crypto to avoid regulations. Bitcoin is above regulation because it cannot be regulated. Individuals however can be arrested, have their assets seized, etc. 
I have no idea why Vitalik has not left Ethereum yet. Eventually he will be forced by governments to compromise or destroy his project. Many people do not understand the wisdom of Satoshi's disappearance. 
This announcement may depress prices for a while, maybe not; but other than price being affected I wouldn't say this is going to "seriously harm crypto"
Crypto is a way to escape corrupt governments ; so a corrupt government saying "nananana don't do that" will only have a temporary effect. Most of this effect is market manipulators. They manipulate the market in conjunction with news which helps propel and give momentum to the price movement. Trolls suddenly appear out of the woodwork in every thread saying that crypto is dying; that governments are closing in, etc etc.
Then a few days/weeks go by; then all the sudden the price surges. All the trolls disappear and are replaced by people saying the price is going to $1Million. 
This has happened so many times it is honestly like a science; I almost applaud those who are able to pull this off because of how well it has worked for them over, and over, and over again.

The quote is very high-level and does not support your assertion that transactions can be censored by 51% of miners without an active and obvious attack on the network.

This is precisely why the fee market is being established. In the near future fees will need to become the dominant revenue stream for miners to insulate against price declines and halving events.
So far we have done well and Bitcoin has roughly doubled in price around each halving period; which helps keep miners afloat. As miner expenses increase; profit margins have decreased; and the halvings will become a more and more risky event unless fee's become the dominant revenue stream. Once fees dominate it won't matter if the price doesn't double and will help miners economic stability.

Crypto is a tool to escape wage slavery but it isn't a one way ticket out of wage slavery.
If you have the skills to start your own business; start it now on the side. Re-invest your business profits into growing your business. When you have extra money at the end of each month start putting some of it away into Bitcoin. 
Grow your business until you can leave your job but not before, unless you've got a very generous fund saved up already. 
If you make an impulsive decision now and lose whatever you have managed to save, you will end up being even more dependent on thankless dead end jobs than you are now.
Bitcoin can theoretically protect us from the silent theft known as inflation ; and thus far has well outpaced inflation (since we are still in an adoption phase). In the long run the gains will be equal to the gains in global wealth rather than the 100-1000% per year we've seen.

What you are describing is a runaway 51% attack (AKA 100% attack). 
That would be very apparent if they decided to re-write the chain dozens or hundreds of blocks in to censor a transaction.
This is not something that they can casually perform. It is a 1 shot opportunity; because once they do it they will be isolated from the network and lose all influence.
Stop equivocating pools with miners. You know darn well that pools are made up of many diverse individuals and that the hashpower actually controlled by the big farms that represent those pools is only a fraction of the pools total output. 
60%+ of mining power may originate from Chinese pools; but the amount coming from large controllable Chinese farms is necessarily smaller. 
Mining centralization is of course a problem; but you are far overstating the likelihood and understating the cost and repercussions of taking advantage of that centralization.

Storing significant amount of funds on a key generated on an internet connected device is definitely not a good idea

If you have a significant amount of Bitcoin you want them stored in a MultiSig address and to store the private keys / seeds in separate places.
Say for instance Bitcoin does something crazy like go to $100k. If you've got 10BTC you are suddenly a millionaire. If unscrupulous people know that you hold the key all they have to do is extort you, threaten you, torture you, etc. 
If your cold wallet requires multiple keys to spend from; stored in different places; it becomes exponentially harder to extort you. If for instance you require 3 keys to spend; one you have; one a family member has; and one in a safety deposit box; it would be very difficult to extort you or hold you for ransom. The attacker would need to convince a family member/friend AND somehow get the key from the safety deposit box.

It would be best if we could temper this bubble out for the next 18months; and then the halving hype in 2020 can push the bubble mainstream.
I do believe that we are approaching a watershed moment or a black swan if you will regarding international finance. 
Bitcoin is more revolutionary than is let on; and I believe there are major considerations and conversations going on behind closed doors as to how to deal with Bitcoin. 
I believe that Bitcoin is in practice too difficult to be stopped by governments. First mover advantages are too great for some countries to ignore. The advantages that Bitcoin offers wealthy individuals will cause those individuals to push for greater Bitcoin integration.
I believe that we will see the deployment of a "CryptoDollar" that will be very similar to "Tether". It will have a stabilized fiat exchange rate and it will allow for the payment of all goods and services in Crypto. 
This will allow the USGovt to continue printing worthless fiat currency and accumulate Bitcoin holdings.
People will convert or just shapeshift or atomically swap their Bitcoin to USDCoin to make purchases; and keep their savings in Bitcoin.
This will give everyone what they want. People can pay with Crypto for everything. Prices can be denominated with a coin that doesn't fluctuate in fiat value. Governments can get a slice of the Crypto Pie; and Crypto gains global legitimacy.
Of course they could try to go the other way and try to ironfist the world into a single global fiat currency and outlaw all Crypto's. But if they lack the ability to enforce that; they will be seen as powerless.
 In general rulers should not pass laws that they are powerless to enforce; because it breeds contempt and demonstrates lack of true authority.

I think a lot of people are genuinely confused, I know I was at one point. Corporations and Businesses aren't the problem, it is the merger of corporations and the state where a corporation can successfully push through laws and regulations that make it impossible for others to compete with them. 
The media has been pushing the narrative that we need more regulations to get corporations under control. When in reality the regulations are what create the loopholes for large established business to get away with anything while making it impossible for competition.
Under the guise of protecting the consumer, protecting the citizens, our rights to form and engage in business, our rights to travel, to communicate, to general privacy have been eroded. 
It is the anti-competitive ; crony-capitalism ; corruptionism that is causing harm. But these cycles have literally happened for thousands of years. Plato even wrote about how governments cycle. Human nature has not changed, these cycles are part of our biology just as building a beehive is part of the bee's biology.
So there is no use "protesting" or "fighting" it would be fighting against 6.4billion years of evolution.
What there is use in, is creating.
I'm probably a little off my rocker, but I feel like now we have Bitcoin, as long as we can buy it and use it, there is no need to protest. I can opt out of the cronyism. I don't have to beg some superior people for "change." I can change the way I hold value, it is the most non-violent protest. If the world wants to change, they will change how they hold their values. I don't need to change them, and nobody else needs to change the world either.

The idea is to have multiple people and locations for each key; such that you can lose access to several people/locations and still have access to your funds.
This does make your funds less accessible. This is great for long term storage rather than regular spending funds.
Instead of one wallet for all your needs I think it is best to have a combination of hot and cold wallets. Small amounts on Phone, Small amounts on Coinbase, larger amounts of warm wallets like Trezor/Ledger, and then your long term savings on airgapped, always offline, geographically distributed multisignature.

Bitcoins has always had big swings; in both directions. Very difficult to predict timing or magnitude. These facts formed my investment strategy and it has made the investing part very easy.

Of course when the price tanks its not fun to see your portfolio go down ; but since it just slowly accumulates its not nearly as gut wrenching as investing $20k+ all at once and watching it dwindle to $5k.
People need to stop "investing" in Bitcoin and start "working" for Bitcoin.
Don't put your savings into Bitcoin; put extra income that would go to unnecessary things into Bitcoin. Instead of getting that snack; put it towards BTC. Instead of drinking put that money towards BTC and invest your extra time and energy into yourself. Instead of getting lunch; brown bag it and put that money towards BTC.
Take the money you would normally waste on items that give your life little or no meaning (or even negatively impact your life) and put it in Bitcoin instead. Don't take out loans, Don't take out (or neglect) your savings.

It is possible in theory; but there are exchanges in dozens of countries throughout the world. It would require a coordinated effort across many countries.
Interestingly this sort of restrictive behavior is exactly what Bitcoin is designed to disrupt. 
A crackdown on capital controls to prevent Bitcoin adoption would cause more people to see the lack of control the legacy financial system offers them.
It would require unprecedented global coordination; and even then this global coordination to prevent people from being free to move their money how they want may disgust people enough to push the tipping point over the edge.
It is possible in theory; but I think the idea of permanently shutting down all bitcoin exchanges is a pipe dream of governments and banks at this point.

There is no way to determine the tops and bottoms; even for experienced traders it is all survivorship bias. 
If you buy or sell based on emotion you will lose your shirt.
The only good advice is that people should have an investment plan in mind BEFORE they invest.

I had been emailing daily for 18months while the price was falling too; often met with their criticism and "concern" ; 
My excitement about this technology is much greater than the price of Bitcoin. I was just as excited about Bitcoin after I lost 70% of my initial investment as I am now that the financial situation has changed. 
While I am very happy about the price appreciation; Bitcoin is about much more than the price. Am I just supposed to stop sharing my enthusiasm for this technology once the price turned around?
So when the price is falling I'm "delusional" to be enthusiastic ; but when the price is rising I'm a jerk for being enthusiastic?
Seems like its really never appropriate to talk about anything beyond the weather or whats on TV.

This is a huge mistake. It would be fine and honest just to say that Xapo considers the chain with the most work to be BTC (though I disagree with that).

You're right; to clarify this is just hash rate; not power consumption.
Can anyone calculate what the power consumption of the network would be if it were running on GPU's from 2009/2010? I'll take a stab at it.
Lets see a Radeon 5970 could get about 700MH/s with a draw of about 500Watts ; thats 1.4MH/s/W
Current estimated Hashrate 10,399,832,230,000 MH/s
That would come to ~7428 GigaWatts
Redoing the calc with todays most efficient miner:
10204 MH/s/W
That comes out to 1.02 GigaWatts in power consumption
Miners have gotten a LOT more efficient over time!

It would most likely depress the price; but even that is not a certainty. 
Banning exchanges would also make it difficult for people to sell large amounts of Bitcoin as it would make it difficult for people to buy.
At this point we have ~$60Billion in value in the Bitcoin ecosystem; even if that goes down 2/3rs we are looking at $20billion ecosystem. There are already many ways to spend your Bitcoin directly; and by banning exchanges it will just cause holders to seek out businesses that accept Bitcoin; and anyone that wants to buy Bitcoin can offer goods or services for it.
Eventually these underground networks would grow and strengthen. As there becomes more goods and services to exchange Bitcoin for; Bitcoin will rise in demand again. At this point it would be much harder to manipulate since there would be no exchanges that governments and banks could use to short Bitcoin.
I'm not trying to say Bitcoin is a sure thing; far from it. But I do think Bitcoin is much more resilient than is sometimes thought; particularly as a network if we don't focus on price. The price is very manipulable.

In the case of a true runaway 51% attack there will be no way for full nodes to pick up the orphaned transactions and reintegrate them.
When people talk about a 51% attack what is really being talked about is a blockwithholding attack where the dominant group of miners is so far ahead that there is no possibility of other miners getting any blocks included.
For instance; if there was a secret group of miners that had 51% of the hashpower; they could choose to mine in secret and not release any blocks on the network for a period of time. At 51 vs 49%; the attackers have a 2% advantage; so for every 100 blocks mined on the public chain the attackers have 102 blocks mined. So if the 51% attackers mine in secret for say 1000 blocks (~8 days) they would be 20 blocks ahead of the honest miners.
So then after 1000 blocks have been mined publicly; they release 1001 blocks they mined in secret; overwriting the chain. Then if public miners find blocks 1002; the attackers release blocks 1002 and 1003. All the while the attackers are working on mining block 1021 in secret. They are so far ahead that the probability of honest miners catching up is nearly impossible.
It wouldn't matter if you had 6 confirmations or 100 confirmations at this point. Once the attackers gain full control of the network and deny all other miners a chance of participating the attackers can re-write the chain as they please.
In that scenario the only way to get rid of the attackers is through a hardfork that invalidates their chain. According to consensus rules the chain with the attackers would be valid; so the only way to get rid of the attackers influence is by changing consensus rules.

Of course the system is slanted against the tax payer!
Taxation is robbery, plain and simple. There is no logic to the rules. The rules are whatever is written; and what is written changes constantly. Its the taxpayers responsibility both to interpret these constant changes to the taxcode as it applies to them and to pay the taxes. 
Confusing and changing tax code is a jobs program for bean counters. 
But even with these absurd tax laws and the ridiculous amount we end up spending on taxes ; you'll end up better off paying the taxman what he thinks he deserves than trying to avoid paying.
That is how robbery works; the bill is usually far less damaging than the punishment for not paying.

So LBC will decide which fork is the real Bitcoin and then take it upon themselves to convert what they deem altcoins to Bitcoin; and they will take whatever conversion fee they feel is necessary!
So if LBC decides B2X is Bitcoin; they may automatically sell their users BTC for B2X; take a fee "not larger than than the total" ; and then add it to your account.
This is quite possibly the worst statement that could be issued.
It invokes fears of worst case scenarios without clarifying at all which fork(s) they will be supporting. 
I think they are very clearly saying that leaving any coins on LBC right now is incredibly risky and if you value any control over your money you should withdrawal immediately.

I think you are misunderstanding how mining works.
Miners can only censor transactions in blocks they mine. In order to successfully pull off a 51% attack the attackers must mine blocks in secret and not publish them to the network. The goal for the attackers is to generate more blocks in secret than the honest miners. Once the attackers have gotten sufficiently further ahead of the network ; say 6 blocks ahead; they publish their blocks which then erases all the transactions that were mined by the honest miners.
Simply controlling 51% of the hashrate does not allow them to censor transactions; they must perform a blockwithholding attack; and then once they control 100% of the network can censor transactions.
Once they have performed this blockwithholding attack; it will cause untold amounts of damage to the Bitcoin ecosystem and an enormous loss of confidence overall. This sort of attack would be extremely expensive (hundreds of millions or billions$) ; for the ability to roll back a few blocks.
In the short term nodes would start banning the malicious miners while an emergency hardfork is rolled out.
This sort of attack only makes sense from state level actors who want to harm Bitcoin; not just censor. The end result will be a total loss of influence when the miners are banned from the network and a potential PoW change is rolled out.
And yes; in the past when there have been true emergencies to the network soft-forks and hard-forks have been readily adopted and implemented.

From 2010 - 2015 almost every single article and public pronouncement regarding Bitcoin was about how it is a joke with no intrinsic value, a pyramid scheme for drug dealers and terrorists to launder money, beanie babies, tulips, etc. Jamie Dimon has made quite a few negative public statements on Bitcoin in the past as well. 
If Bitcoin is in demand; we are past the point where it can be stopped with force. The only way to destroy Bitcoin right now is to destroy the demand for it. Governments should avoid trying to ban things they don't have the power to actually enforce. It makes them look weak and breeds contempt. When Governments ban something that is in demand by the people it doesn't go away; its price just increases.
What happened to the price of Gold after it was banned by the US in the early 20th century?
Actually shutting down Bitcoin would require the cooperation of pretty much all major nations on Earth; and even then it could still spring up from the ashes. It would be prohibitively expensive and fruitless to try to enforce a global Bitcoin shut down.
Now that isn't to say that the enemies of Bitcoin cannot damage the other side of the equation; Demand for Bitcoin. 
But when I think about it; this doesn't bother me too much for a couple reasons.
I got into Bitcoin because of its revolutionary potential to level the playing field financially; and to stick it to the banks/governments for selling out our future prosperity. I got into Bitcoin so I could guarantee 100% reserve of my own funds. I got into Bitcoin so that I can choose what I do with my money and when. Bitcoin is Freedom money to me.
If there are people who are selling their coins because Governments/Banks disapprove; then this will only strengthen Bitcoin by redistributing those coins to people who are in Bitcoin for (what is in my opinion) the correct reasons.
Anyone who is scared away from Bitcoin because Banks and Governments produce PR against it; they are Statist shills who are in Bitcoin for short term gain and don't deserve the Freedom that Bitcoin can provide.
It is better these people sell their Bitcoin now so they don't have any leverage in the future.
This is exactly why Bitcoin is "Anti-Fragile" ; this sort of PR will only shake out those who don't understand Bitcoin's place in this world and increase the power of those who do understand it.
Now that isn't to say that Bitcoin is a sure thing. It is an insanely risky experiment and it is irresponsible to hold funds in Bitcoin that you are depending on. Bitcoin could very well crash to $0. I don't believe thats the case at all; but everyone involved in Bitcoin should be prepared for 20-90% crashes at basically anytime until we get closer to $1-$5Trillion Marketcap.
I plan to keep accumulating until 2032. I've been treating it as secondary savings account (well with valuation increases now primary). Just set aside a % of income every week and let it accumulate. Because I have no intention of taking advantage of any of the gains for over a decade these huge dips are not as panic inducing.
 In 2032 the block reward will be around 0.78BTC/block. Bitcoin will be 23 years old. Bitcoin will either be orders of magnitude more valuable than it is now; or it will be nearly worthless. We have not even come close to reaching an equilibrium of users and use cases.

Revenue/Tx Fee's looks like how this is calculated
$5700*1800(coins per day)/~$1Million Tx fee's/day
This ratio is completely worthless since it is based on metrics that in no way correlate to traditional P/E ratio's. 
Some days Tx fee's are very high and the price is lower which results in a far lower ratio
On Aug 22nd price was ~$4100; Tx fee's were ~$2.3Million
P/E on August 22nd was 3.2x
So because SegWit has caused fee's to decrease the P/E ratio suggests that Bitcoin is worth less. Absolutely nonsense.

This depends on what your end goal regarding your bitcoins. Do you want ultimate security or do you want easy access with moderate security?
Honestly my recommendation is creating many denominations of paper wallets. It will be some time and energy, but trust me, it will be worth it.
By creating individually encrypted paper wallets your full "savings" are no longer at risk, each wallet must be individually cracked greatly increasing the time and energy, while reducing the "reward" for a potential attacker. If done properly the only way for someone else to access your bitcoin is if you divulge the decryption keys.
You have a lot to secure, you should plan a full weekend for this task, but you will feel safe and understand how to secure your coins in the future.
First consider denomination sizes for paper wallets. Consider the possibility that Bitcoin reaches $10k or $100k, how much do you want in your less secured "hot wallet" at a time? 
For storing 100 BTC I would create (In triplicate) BIP38 encrypted wallets.
* 50 Wallets with 1 BTC Denomination
* 50 Wallets with 0.5 BTC Denomination
* 100 Wallets with 0.25 BTC Denomination
Laminate your paper wallets and geographically distribute them. Safety Deposit boxes, trusted friends and family, etc.
Whenever you need to spend Bitcoin just redeem your paperwallets into your preferred Bitcoin client by decrypting and importing the private keys.

I think you will need to add some newly mined coins from one chain to your address(es) before you can split safely.
When blocks are mined after the fork; the coinbase rewards won't match the same addresses. So if you add Bitcoins generated after the fork to your address the transaction should only be valid on the chain with the new coins. 
Pain in the butt if you have a bunch of addresses but it should be doable.

That would only change the final numbers slightly, and actually decreases the total amount that can be invested prior to halving without major slippage. Instead of 500 days to halving its 400. The numbers adjust to ~$800million and $2.2billion for $1/day and $5/day slippage respectively.

The inverter was measuring 10.9KW (there are more panels at a less efficient angle).
So I did 10.9KW x 16 hours and rounded up. 174.4KW
In a few months I'll have some better real-world data and certainly don't expect it to produce at that rate on average.
Though I am confused; why do you say peak production is at the winter solstice and equinoxes?

It takes the courage to accept possible failure due to your own mistakes when you take actions outside of what is "normal" and socially encouraged.
If you go with the flow and fail; well you're just doing what is expected of you in society. 
If you go on your own direction against the advice of others and fail; that failure is very clearly and obviously your fault.
In reality failure is failure and success is success. You own your actions and your decisions always follow your true beliefs about this world, even if they are in conflict with your vocally stated beliefs.
A person who believes in gravity does not walk off a cliff (unless they're suicidal). Every action a person takes is rooted in their deeply held beliefs about the way the world works. Part of the problem is that peoples beliefs about the way the world works can be easily influenced by their desires about the way the world should work, in spite of evidence to the contrary.

Our homes foundation is cracked from the low frequency vibrations these haulers have produced. The air stinks with diesel and smog; and the environment rings and hums with noise. Don't even get me started on federal taxes.

Probably somewhat. There are many reasons people sell. I'm no trader, never made a single cent trading, just a holder and occasional spender. I've been watching the price for a couple years, alongside major stockmarket indicators like the DOW.
Bitcoin price movements cannot be predicted or explained more than a few minutes in advance. Volatility in Bitcoin and the Stock Market are increasingly linked. When the stock market is volatile, bitcoin is more likely to be volatile, though the direction of the volatility is unpredictable.
My conclusion has been that bitcoin price movements are the result of large actors buying and selling, sometimes individually, sometimes as a consortium. If you are very skilled you may be able to find an algorithm to ride these waves or make some arbitrage, but you'll probably lose your shirt.
If you understand the fundamentals (mining, transaction rate, development projects) and believe they are moving in a positive direction, then the price only has one way to go in the long term.

It makes sense to take profits along the way; but you'd be crazy to sell everything before ~2036/2040 if you'd still be under retirement age at that point. Many people here would be 65 or younger in 18/22 years.
The value proposition increases rapidly as time marches onward.
The population continues expanding, younger people more comfortable with digital currency mature and have greater income streams, fiat currency inflates, trust in Bitcoin increases as time proves its security model, use cases increases, adoption and overall acceptance increases, coins get lost over time. The % inflation from mining drops to negligible levels.
20+ years from now if Bitcoin is still around I'd wager its value will either exceed $5Million USD ; or it won't even be measured in USD.

Of course its a lot; and those of us that have been around longer are probably dealing with much much larger "losses" than most of the people panicking right now.

I'm not saying this to be mean; but genuinely. If you are freaking out over the price falling 20% after rising 1000% in the past 18months then you are in the wrong asset class. It is not good for your mental well being to be overinvested.

Precisely, once I started looking into how money works,after stumblingupon Money Is Debt, and then spending months learning more about fractional reserve banking I felt desperate to get out of the system. It seemed to me that Banking Institutions have disproportionate amount of power, power that is only growing. This power is only concerned with increasing its power/wealth, a natural primate instinct. Our primate instincts however should not be guiding world resource utilization decisions. Desperate to get out, Bitcoin was invented. I was very interested in it by 2010, but more on the "this could be cool if it takes off" and after introducing friends and family to the idea (who laughed it off) I ignored it for a few years. Now Bitcoin has grown enormous proportions in 6 years and its momentum is only increasing. Short of quitting your job and working for yourself Bitcoin is the best way to protest systematic global enslavement.

The lapse in difficulty adjustments could happen, but I also imagine that large Bitcoin institutions either mine or have relationships with mining operations that could keep the miners solvent through tough times, if that were to happen. Any increase in price will be paralleled by increases in mining capacity as mining operations re-invest their gains to try to capture marketshare. A slow steady climb followed by a precipitous crash in bitcoin price could be damaging to the mining economy. Miners and power generation will probably become more common, if you produce the power at discount your ROI is quicker.

Energy rates have increased by 4% per year on average for the past 20 years and there is no sign of that slowing down.
In the next year rates are expected to increase more than 10% on average.

I've been sending out near daily emails to my immediate family members since 2014 about Bitcoin. 
The emails are a mix of education on the technical basics of Bitcoin ; philosophical musings about Bitcoin ; and referencing current events and news articles that relate to Bitcoin or the corruption of the legacy system.
When I first started the emails; the price was in the $600's ; over the next few months the price fell down into the $300's and then into the $200's. 
My family became concerned that I was delusional; being so excited over something that was clearly a failure. I kept trying to explain to them the long term implications. I kept trying to give them perspective; that even in the $200's the price was still an order of magnitude higher than it was a year before. Nope; their response; Bitcoin is dead and you are naive and delusional.
My conviction did not waiver; they had convinced me in 2011 NOT to buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin and I was not letting that mistake repeat itself.
I continued to send out emails. When the market fell into the low $200's I remember almost begging them to just get one. I kept trying to explain the concept of asymmetric investments; that the worst that could happen is they lose $200; but the upside potential was enormous. They had already decided Bitcoin was a failed scam and they were not interested. 
Fast forward a year or so later and they resent me now that Bitcoin has been appreciating. When the price hit $1000 my brother told me he never wanted to speak to me again. 
It's funny because not only have I kept them all informed with every development for the past 3.5 years ; but I've also given them all substantial amounts of Bitcoin that they've proceeded to lose. 
I literally could not have done more to help them get access to Bitcoin ; and now they literally resent me because it is rising.

On the one hand these very people are responsible for the current state of world affairs so fuck em.

With Bitcoin, anything is possible.
No but seriously; Bitcoins price is entirely supply and demand (sprinkled heavily with manipulation) ; so if there was significant demand by big money price could move astronomically in short order.
But big money wouldn't want to do that since it would then just crash right down and they'd lose a lot. If I had $1Billion to invest in Crytpo I wouldn't just purchase it. I'd move in as slowly as I could without increasing the price. I'd try to dump when the market gets heated up in hopes of purchasing more at a lower price. Then when I've got 95% of the goal invested; just pump it with the last 5%. If I had that much money to invest, I'd probably know some other institutions, and perhaps work together to pump and dump for maximum profit.

Are you getting molds made and casting these or printing?
These parts are pretty simple and should lend themselves fairly easily to make molds. I'd probably suggest getting a nice clean master made in SLA ; creating a silicone mold; and then casting in something like polyurethane. Spray paint the colors on and then seal with clearcoat. That would probably be most cost effective for 500-2000 units; more than that probably maybe look into injection molding.

Thank you so much for all the info! Hopefully the tech does indeed improve.
Right now we are experimenting to see if we can successfully use Bitcoin as a battery of stored energy.
The idea is that instead of sending excess power to the grid and accumulating energy credits with the power company; that we convert this excess electricity into low-entropy strings (hashes) via miners that we sell to the Bitcoin network. Then when we need more power than we are producing; convert the Bitcoins into payment to the energy company.
I'm not sure if it will really work out; but the "Bitcoin Battery" is an idea I've been knocking around for a long time. If it ends up being successful on a small scale over the next 3 years I'll ramp it up.

If you are exchanging real, hard money like Bitcoin for bank money; you want to make sure that the bank agrees the money you are accepting is acceptable.
Bitcoin is self-verifying so you don't need any authority to authenticate it for you.
So when going back into fiat; make sure to have the transaction authenticated by the authority. At the end of the day fiat is just permission from a central authority.

I'll be mining 24/7 and if we need more power I'll add more panels.
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:54:57
Those are definitely good things to keep in mind.
Our utility was charging me 14.3 cents per KWH when I last checked.
Our utility does not pay us for excess power; they provide a 1:1 energy credit for excess power. This way we can save up extra energy produced over the summer to provide for the lack of production during winter.
Something also to keep in mind is that the 4% is an average over 20 years. There were several 3 year periods over which the cost of energy decreased significantly, before increasing again.
The 180KWH is the absolute maximum potential they could generate in a day with perfect conditions. Its 32 330 watt panels which should equate to 10.56 KW; but when we measured it at the Inverter during full sun we saw peaks up to 10.9KW ; so 10.9 with 16 hours of full sun could be a theoretical max of 174KWH.  We just got this setup so check back in a month or two and I'll be able to give you real hard numbers.

Bitcoin won't stop people from needing to work and I've never claimed that.  What I said is that people work their lives away for the almighty dollar without questioning what it is they are working for.


Will Bitcoin end the need for work? Absolutely not.
But working for a deflationary money instead of an inflationary money allows people to retain and grow the value of their labor over time.
When you work for inflationary currency you are forced to make a decision and turn it into a relatively non-liquid asset like stocks, bonds, real-estate, etc in order to retain or grow its value.  Most people in the world are working paycheck to paycheck without any stored value.
The richest people in the world are those closest to the printing press and the banking institutions that inflate the currency supply through fractional reserve. The richest among us get to enjoy spending money created out of thin air before the impact of increased supply of currency reduces its value.
Those working paycheck to paycheck which is the vast majority of humanity, their wages are sticky. Their wages don't increase as the currency supply increases; at least not in lock-step. The poorest and hardest working people in the world are the ones that fiat currency inflation steals the most from.
I'm not one of those people who believe that we need to "redistribute" wealth; but I do strongly believe that the mechanics behind the money we all work for should be politically neutral and not designed to steal from the hardest working among us.

Energy rates have risen an average of 4% per year for the past 20 years.
Assuming this trend continues into the future it will take 7-9 years to break even (assuming complete loss on any mining done).
The panels use relatively new technology that supposedly guarantee  to retain at least 91% of their max output for 25 years ; which is the length of the warranty. Based on my research they should continue producing for 40 years+ , but I'd imagine after 25 years there might be newer tech we'd invest in. After 25 years the total savings will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It was a total of $3.25 per watt including installation; about the national average. Considerably less after the 30% tax credit.
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:07:47
With the tax credit it would take 10 years to pay itself off without energy costs increasing. Without the tax credit ~14 years to pay itself off.
So over the 25 year warranty period the only way these panels could be a loss is if the cost of power decreases dramatically. Are there better returning investments, absolutely. Will I be able to buy more Bitcoin with the money I save than the amount I could have bought outright with this system? Probably not.
Solar is a great investment. It produces something you use and need everyday. Its very low risk if you plan to stay in place at least 10 years (longer the better) ; but it isn't going to make you rich.

I really don't think we are risking "tough times" with the halving reward, I do believe that institutions dependent on the blockchain would be smart enough to be invested directly in the blockchain via mining if there ever were a threat to mining profitability.
The halving event is well understood, we've gone through one before and many alts have gone through them before. Everyone is well aware that 50% less coins will be produced after block 420,000. This will be priced in accordingly. Mining firms that overshoot or undershoot their mining operations will struggle, and those that happened to plan perfectly will come out ahead, just like always.

Sorry, calculation may have been naive; but the panels are real :) 
We expect to produce 15,000 KWH annually based on average sunlight in our area, and this was the number provided by installers.
 
 I was curious what the maximum daily production could be so multiplied the value on the inverter times 16 hours of sunlight. 
Being in the hot Australian sun I'd imagine you lose some efficiency to the heat?
Our panels are 330 watts; and there are a total of 32.

Many people see the rising global debt as an indication of a coming economic collapse. I agree that current levels of debt are unsustainable ; however I don't believe the economic "meltdown" will proceed as many believe it will. Most people when they think of economic collapse associate it with the collapse of markets; real-estate, stock markets, etc.
But when debt truly reaches unsustainable levels economic collapse doesn't manifest as falling markets. It will manifest as skyrocketing markets.
We are already paying a significant fraction of the US budget to just pay the interest on our current debt. 7.4% of our total budget is spent just on the interest on the US debt. Each year this % rises and at a certain point we will be faced with cutting other programs in order to just pay the interest on this debt. This is known as austerity.
Austerity in Europe happens because no one country controls the currency. So when greece goes into debt; it can't just create more money to pay off that debt. It must cut programs or raise taxes to pay that debt.
In the US on the other hand; we control the worlds reserve currency. So as our debt increases; and our interest payments increase; we can print more money to pay off those interest payments.
But the USD is itself an instrument of Debt. So printing more money just increases the debt; increasing the interest payments ; increasing the need to print more money and go deeper in debt.
This pattern has repeated itself countless times throughout history.
The collapse will actually cause prices of everything to increase at increasing rates. Owners of assets and means of production will greatly benefit ; those on fixed salaries or income will lose.
People think that Bitcoin is a bubble; but don't even consider that Fiat may be in an enormous bubble.
Fiat currencies have no intrinsic value; they have literally nothing backing it at all. Unless somehow you think violence is backing. There are some legal requirements that give it some value (because you must pay taxes in it); Its just special paper with some hightech inks; but beyond that the value of dollars are entirely psychological.
Bitcoin on the other hand is backed by energy; Bitcoin is Stored Work. Not only is it just random "Stored Work" ; but the work thats stored is the work of securing itself! In addition to being backed by energy and work; Bitcoin exists independent of any State. Countries can come and go; but Bitcoin is not dependent on any. Bitcoins incentive system makes it very likely that people will keep working for Bitcoin for decades if not hundreds or even thousands of years from now.
The world needs a global reserve currency ; and we need a currency that cannot be manipulated by corrupt individuals. That is why we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be changed; it cannot be bent to the whims of any politician. They can't inflate or deflate it. Bitcoin is money independent of politics. Bitcoin is the Jubilee the world has been waiting for.

No other coin has the essential property of decentralization that allows Cryptocurrency to have value.
Bitcoin is more decentralized than any other coin; not just by a little; but astronomically more decentralized. This condition allows it to have value.
If Bitcoin itself were centralized; it would have already been killed. If Bitcoin were destroyed; no Altcoin would have value because they are much, much more susceptible to the same kind of attacks that harm Bitcoin.
There is no benefit for using a blockchain over a database if it is centrally controlled. All the value of Bitcoin is 100% dependent on decentralization.
So all these coins with better "features" are a distraction; for the most part. These features are useless without the decentralized base layer.
You can already instantly send money with debit, CC, cash. You can earn points and do chargebacks. Your account gets hijacked; no problem fraud protection kicks in. 
Very few coins are utilizing the blockchain in a way that takes advantage of its revolutionary properties. Most coins are a distraction of features built on a foundation of hot air.

I'm not sure this is the case.
Most people will literally work their life away to chase USD or other fiat. They wonder why they can't get ahead. They aren't interested in the mechanics of what gives USD value; yet they will slave away 40+ hours a week to for those USD.
The truth is; everybody cares. People get upset because talking about monetary policy brings into question the labor of their lives.
Most people get naturally defensive when they feel threatened or attacked; even subconsciously. So when I talk about the superiority of Bitcoin to USD and other fiat currencies what they are hearing is "You've wasted your entire working life to support a conspiracy to keep you enslaved"
So people will naturally defend the object that they've been working for, for decades; as well as put up resistance to new ideas.
The idea that most people don't care about the mechanics of wealth creation is just not true. Everybody (almost) wants to be wealthier; and want to understand how to be wealthier. Its just that most people don't have the intellectual tools to even comprehend basic market dynamics and therefore aren't capable of digesting or parsing claims about monetary policy.
I've had quite a few college educated (in STEM fields) near retirement age adults, who own stocks, IRA, etc; who ask me "Who/What determines the price of Bitcoin? It changes all the time"
People with millions in assets that are completely ignorant to how the market determines the price of anything. People who think that the prices of goods and services are set by other people and not by markets.
Most people care intimately about Wealth. We've just had such a ridiculous 150+ year economic bullrun hangover from the industrial revolution that people have been able to successfully get by and raise families for several generations without having to understand the dynamics of wealth.

My only issue with recommending Hardware wallets as a general storage solution is simply that the ecosystem doesn't have enough competition yet. There are two main offerings, Ledger and Trezor.
If everyone is storing everything on devices made by these two companies; it is not difficult to imagine that they could be coerced to compromise their devices at the hardware level by state actors.
Eventually as more competing devices enter the market this attack vector will be limited. But new entrants to this market take time to mature; who wants to trust a brand new HW company over the established and trusted ones?

If Ver would refrain from associating with CSW I could see Ver as an eccentric Bitcoiner whom I just happen to have technical differences in vision with; but his association with CSW really makes me consider the possibility that Ver truly is a Confidence Man. 
Ver has used peoples confidence in him to convince people to leave their funds at MT GOX ; which maybe could have been just an example of bad judgement.

Bitcoin is a financial Black Hole
When the first real world Bitcoin transaction took place that is when Bitcoin reached the Chandrasekhar limit ; it formed an event horizon that has been attracting all wealth towards it.
As wealth passes this horizon its boundaries expand and the gravitational pull continues increasing until it has absorbed all wealth on the planet. 
Buying Bitcoin, Mining Bitcoin are extremely limited avenues for acquiring Bitcoin when thousands of millions are waiting to join and only 1800 are mined per day. 
For a hypothetical example; 
If an additional 1Million people wanted to enter the market to buy 1 Bitcoin each for $6000 they would need to patiently line up and agree to wait their turn in line one by one and the last one would get their $6000 Bitcoin in 550 days! If anyone jumped ahead in line then the price would increase! 
This of course is assuming an existing supply/demand equilibrium.
Anyways at a certain point buying or mining Bitcoin simply won't fulfill the demand; even with enormous increases in price. At this point retailers, businesses, services will begin pricing their products in Bitcoin. This will be the inflection point where people start getting rid of their dollars as fast as they can for goods and Bitcoin. 
Eventually all goods and services will be priced in Bitcoin; and we will have transitioned the world into a more sustainable path.

If the banks are smart, which they are, they will recognize the value of the blockchain.
They will most likely first, and foremost, attempt to invent their own. They will try to develop their own algorithm, their own mining hardware and try to use it for internal accounting. They may be successful, but the amount of resources required to secure their blockchain, all in secret, without mining incentives will make this difficult.
Upon realizing their failure to re-invent bitcoin, they will adopt it internally for accounting purposes. All the while they will publicly dismiss and deride bitcoin to keep the price low. The public will be using Bitcoin, but they won't know it, their accounts all pegged to USD. Once the Banks are sufficiently satisfied with their Bitcoin holdings, they will bring the price skyrocketing.
The people won't understand what is happening, they'll start to notice loss of purchasing power of the dollar, but they won't immediately connect it to the hyperdeflation in Bitcoin. They will simply see a bunch of bratty nerds getting rich while they are getting poorer. The resentment and animosity towards bitcoin holders begins to grow. People have some misguided vague notion that these bitcoin people are siphoning away "our" value, our property, everything we've worked for. The banks still aren't cluing people in that the global financial system is already running on bitcoin, they feed the fire of public outrage against the building "cryptoanarchy." The State then declares holding/hoarding bitcoin to be illegal except by highly regulated entities. Holders are asked to turn in their bitcoin to the State at market rate. It is at this same moment that the legacy financial system turns 100% bitcoin. The price of bitcoin soars to $3million USD equivalents. Value of Banks reaches astronomical heights. No human (outside the banks) can legally purchase, own, or transact in this deflationary currency directly, power remains firmly consolidated in the hands of the banks. The beginning of a new global slavery.
At least those are a couple strategies I would consider, but then again, I don't run any banks.

An interesting thought.
If someone invested $10,000 into mining hardware when Bitcoin was $1000/BTC (so 10BTC) would they be better off now than if they had bought 10BTC and held?
Average price per KWH in US is $0.12/KWH.
Around this time the KnC Jupiter came out with 0.55TH/s for about $5000 according to this article: 
So for $10,000 you could buy 1.1TH/s in late 2013.
Each use about 800W so 1.6KW
1.6*24 = 38.4KWH/Day * $0.12 = $4.6/day in electricity costs
The hashrate at this time was approximately 5Petahashes; 5,000TH/s
By June (6months) the hashrate is ~80,000 TH/s
So this person with 1.1TH/s starts with enough hashpower to solve 0.022% of all blocks, and within 6months time is solving 0.0014% of all blocks.
The price fluctuated from $950 to $450 or so within this timeframe. I couldn't find a detailed price breakdown so my analysis updated the price every 2 weeks or whenever more than a $50 change over 3 days occurred.
Assuming a linear decrease over this 6month period, and assuming they sold all their coins, they roughly made a profit of $43,000 in this 6month timeframe after subtracting electricity and the $10,000 initial investment. That is, they turned 10BTC into 71.6BTC through mining.
The mining landscape was completely different back then, this analysis took some time, I should run this same analysis for the last 6months of 2015.
This also assumes they received their equipment on time and had no downtime.

PoW is what secures your transactions.
With BCH operating at less than 15% of BTC's difficulty the security of a single confirmation on BTC's blockchain could be thought of roughly equivalent to the security of about 6 confirmations on BCH.
So from that perspective it takes 6x longer to provide the same transaction security.
SegWit blocks can get up to close to 4Mb if its all witness data.
So in the time it takes BCH to get 6 confirmations for a 32MB block; BTC will have provided the same level of security for 24MB worth of transactions.
The BCH blocksize increase centralized the network into very few hands. Nobody is transacting on BCH because the vast majority of those doing significant commerce rejected BCH and continued to embrace BTC. This is apparent when looking at everything from transactions, price, hashrate, nodecount, etc.
So to summarize, BCH greatly reduced the decentralization of their network in order to provide a modest increase in transaction processing over BTC. BCH has not implemented malleability fix that would enable them to easily implement LN and other higher tiered scaling solutions.
If BCH ever were to actually see their 32MB blocks utilized it would knock out all but the mining nodes; and the BCH community embraces this. Without non-mining user run nodes; users have absolutely no sway over the protocol rules the miners choose to implement; and without running a node users are not even transacting in a P2P manner. It brings back the client-server-client relationship.
Because BTC is actively developing higher tiered solutions; those 4MB blocks will be filled with transactions that represent hundreds, thousands, or possibly tens of thousands of transactions on higher layers. Whereas with BCH; due to not implementing SegWit; higher layers will be much more difficulty to implement; and there is no reason for their developers to ever work on them since its the stated goal of the BCH roadmap to continually increase the base blocksize whenever the blocks get congested. Further centralizing the network with each step.

I've been watching the difficulty estimation pretty regularly and up until a couple days ago we were scheduled to have a small 0.5% decrease in difficulty. In the past few days an enormous amount of hashpower has been added to cause us to have such a tremendous increase. Looking through the blocks it looks like it was just in the past 48 hours or so that generation times were significantly less than 10mins average.

We need to have a talk about "Manipulation"
Everyone who has a stake in any investment does their best to "manipulate" the market into their desired state.
Whether thats through making overly bullish remarks to friends and family, spreading FUD and FOMO on major media stations, social media, etc. Crashing the price with coordinated sell orders, pumping it up through coordinated buys. 
The truth is; the current price is a reflection of everyone and every institutions manipulation schemes in aggregate. There is no "manipulation" if you don't allow yourself to get manipulated.
When you buy (or sell) you should have a decision matrix created in advance. A matrix that tells you "If this happens, then I do that" ; and then stick to your matrix. This prevents you from FOMOing or dumping simply due to emotion. 
Those trying to manipulate the market will end up losing enormously when the market moves against the direction they are trying to prod people in. If you have a decision matrix in advance, its much more difficult to manipulate you.
If you thought Bitcoin was a good buy at $20k then it should be an amazing buy at $7k ; otherwise you were either being manipulated then; or you're being manipulated now. The short term price should not change your long-term opinions on a revolutionary technology; if you are prone to such flippancy you should probably avoid trading or investing.

Yet, you've never shown where it was their intent to cause people to lose money nor have you provided a single instance of somebody actually losing money in practice. If you have lost money over this, go ahead and try to press charges. I used bitcoin during all the stress tests, and there was an issue using my smartphone app payment at a restaurant during a previous stress test. There was also an issue with a bitcoin ATM that I tested for $5, it ate my money and didn't send any coins. Operators number was on the machine, called it, and he sent me $5 in bitcoin. Was it CoinWallets fault or the shitty ATM and poorly programmed Apps fault? It didn't cause me to "lose" any money. Both the wallet app and BTM have upgraded since the last test. I haven't checked out the BTM during this test though. Since the test was announced I used the opportunity to probe what services/software that I use need to be improved. This undeniably helps the network. Bitcoin is still tiny with (compared to global giants) an insignificant number of users, all of which should be aware that bitcoin is an experiment in many ways, an experiment that must test itself to ward off real danger. Regardless of your position on blocksize, what happens when there is a massive adoption event and nodes crash because they aren't efficiently handling the surge in the mempool? Issues can make themselves transparent during these tests that can then have proposals coded and then when the traffic is organically at peak we have different proposals to deal with any problem as they arise, rather than having to quickly patch in a solution to a previously unknown problem.
Now getting back to "the bar" please for the love of God provide evidence that CoinWallets intent was to "Purposefully cause others to lose money." It is really simple, if they have made a statement like that then I am wrong and you are right, so please just show me the quote.

I think it could be argued that there are more power centers. I also think it could be easily argued that the largest "powers" now have greater influence over the world than any of the strongest powers 1000 years ago. Since the rise of Nuclear states a single power center can potentially end civilization. That is something not possible 100 or 1000 years ago. The power structures that form around such immense authority and sovereignty are certainly much more influential than any single corporation.
Though I do agree, corporate power has signifcantly risen over the past 70 years or so, and their entanglement and fighting over control of the nation states could very well be the catalyst that ends the nation states and leaves corporations in control. 
How those corporations manage their assumed nuclear stockpiles however may be frightening.

Major investors that actually move the market aren't making trades based on media news. They make trades based on industry news that usually doesn't make headlines or if it does makes headlines much after the fact.
Sure the "news" created FOMO and it created FUD in 2017/2018. Thats just short term distractions. The news media does not drive the price in the long run; the fundamentals do.
The news media can create a mania in either direction that the real investors just use to profit off of.
Even if media was overwhelmingly negative from here on out; assuming the network fundamentals remain unchanged; Bitcoin will succeed regardless of media assaults. 
The news is a tool of major players to drive prices to support their next move; accumulation or dump. 
Eventually Bitcoin will be beyond these manipulators; but we still have quite some time to go.

Abnormal spikes on a single exchange like that are often (not always) due to problems with Fiat withdrawal. Sometimes an exchange loses its banking partner or are otherwise limited in their ability to deposit fiat due to improper reserve management.
So what will happen if people can't withdrawal fiat; they exchange for BTC to withdrawal and then send to another exchange to withdrawal fiat. This causes a spike in the price of Bitcoin as people rush to change their fiat to BTC so they can get their money out of a failing (or what they perceive to be failing) exchange.
But if the exchange is running a fractional reserve in Bitcoin you'll see the exchange start to limit, delay, or otherwise impede the ability to withdrawal BTC as well.

For me Bitcoin is a major part of my goal of greater independence from what I consider a crumbling global infrastructure. 
I see people posting about Cars and other toys purchased with Bitcoin gains, but not a lot of tools or productive assets.
These panels can produce up to 180KWH on the long sunny summer days and will provide 100% of the power my family needs. We added an extra 2KW to the system to plan for future energy increases as our family grows; for the time being we will sell the excess power to the Bitcoin network.
EDIT: The 180KWH was a naive calculation I made by multiplying the output measured at the inverter by 16 hours per day of max sunlight. Others have pointed out this is highly inaccurate and that I should expect a maximum daily output over 94KWH under the best conditions.
Some have questioned the impact inflation has on my savings estimates. Our direct energy costs have gone up significantly in the past 5 years. There have been years where the cost of energy decreased; but the long term trend is 4% average per year. 
My utility costs per KWH 5 years ago and today:

Can it be reasonably assumed that most major mining operations sell 100% of mined coins?
If that is the case then we should expect to see miners begin withholding coins over the next 10months.
They can decrease the amount they sell by 5% per month and hold onto those extra coins for after the halving. In this way they will have already reduced the amount they sell down to 50% by the halving (thus experiencing no immediate shock). Then after the halving they have some extra coins to sell which should bring the price down for a little correction.
Currently price has held relatively steady for 9months. This means roughly supply and demand are matched. As miners begin withholding coins from the market, the newly minted/available supply drops. We should expect to see some upwards growth if demand stays stagnate.
The price may not skyrocket, but I'd be shocked if we don't experience some significant upward growth due to the halving.

I think Bitcoin mining is about to evolve into a stage of power production.
If you have the capital to build a multi-fueled power plant (Solar, Wind, Gas) along with your bitcoin mine you can get your energy costs down very low, perhaps even turning a profit on just selling your extra power to the community. 
Perhaps a small power plant for Universities or apartments would be the most appropriate. They could sell the excess heat produced by the miners routed to individual rooms.
In some cases businesses are finding that the monthly bill for loan repayment on a full solar system is less than their current power bills. This will only spur on the investment into power production itself.

You're forgetting to factor an average increase of 4% inflation in energy costs.
We pay about $2400 a year for power currently; at 4% energy price inflation that will be over $6000 a year in 25 years.
4% is the average cost energy prices increase per year over the past 20 years; which is why I'm using it in my calculations.
So in 25 years it will save about $70k after accounting for the cost of the system; and thats just the warranty period. Most solar panels last 40 years or so.
If they are sufficient for 40 years they will save just about $200,000.
Its not a question of whether this will save money in the long run; the only question is whether this money could make greater returns being invested elsewhere.

Bitcoin shouldn't be vulnerable to a few dozen BTC spent on transaction fee's. This test will be very interesting if it is as large in scale as advertised. 
Regardless of your take on the blocksize issue this test should be illuminating.
Considering this should backlog for weeks there are several outcomes.
1) Wallets increase their fee's and route around the stress test
2) Miners refuse to mine spam
3) Backlog causes problems and confusion within the bitcoin economy.
4) Unintended/Unknown consequences.
If all we see happening is  it would actually stall the blocksize increase I would imagine. If it turns out Bitcoin is not vulnerable to this kind of attack, and the "spam" transactions do eventually get processed, I think this will show the resilience of the network.
If we see  occur, we will have to come to consensus on what constitutes as a "spam" transaction
If we see  occur this will spur on the blocksize increase camp.
and well who knows about  I think that is really what people worry about. All the other problems aren't catastrophic. The unknown is much scarier than the known possibilities.
Either way if Bitcoin is to succeed, Id rather these bugs be worked out now rather than when there is even more wealth at stake.

I tend to agree. Most people really don't care about the philosophy or benefits Bitcoin brings. Fiat systems have collapsed time and time again and yet the majority of people store their wealth in fiat or fiat based assets. People will use bitcoin when their bank or their government tells them it is money, and this is not likely to happen for quite some time. Banks and governments may use bitcoin to denominate fiat accounts and settle with other banks/nations. Freedom seeking individuals will use bitcoin itself. Smart money may flock to bitcoin as capital controls approach, but most will wait until it is too late. The general public will not use bitcoin directly unless it allows them to do something they otherwise cannot or it saves them lots of money.

I still don't understand how it is any different from what they are doing now if all that is being transferred just "represents" value, but isn't real value itself.
All the middlemen that are involved are required to ensure that each party plays nice. When you directly transfer ownership of the thing of value itself you can get rid of these layers. But when all you end up transferring is an IOU, wouldn't you still need all the middlemen to handle the contracts? 
I really dont understand how this can work unless there is some value placed on the tokens themselves. If there isn't they are just transferring data and we have been doing that quite well without a blockchain. Maybe the blockchain would help them to keep track of the sequence of events, i'm not sure.

Not that they are necessarily accumulating a significant fraction, but I think the idea that most banks wouldn't be playing with new FinTech is delusional. It is quite apparent that many banks are now discussing blockchain technology and it is likely that they are playing around with some bitcoin as they understand it.

Credit inflates the currency supply.
When credit is cheap and easily available prices skyrocket. See Student Loans and Higher Education costs ; or Subprime loans and the Real-estate bubble and subsequent meltdown.
When credit is expensive there is less money inflating markets; prices come down to satisfy the supply and demand of money.
Loans are only necessary because loans are available. If mortgages didn't exist people would still build, buy, and sell homes. 
People will naturally be more careful about their purchases in a world with deflationary money. People will really question the current value any product or good provides versus the potential future value of products or goods that same money would buy in the future.
People will focus on necessary goods and things that genuinely increase their enjoyment of life. It will completely refocus the global economy and many of the wasteful industries that provide no real value to the world will collapse.

This is really genius. All they have to do is release a small number of keys at 10minute intervals.
2 Keys released every 10minutes with 0.1 BTC each. Hard to say how many transactions each will generate, it is looking like hundreds from the first few they have released. 
I am anticipating the mempool to grow to 600-1000Mb as a result of this.
Bitcoin is undergoing another massive stress test starting today, and it is hard to say when it will end.
Rather ingenius of the people who put this test together.
Instead of simply generating thousands of raw transactions, this group (CoinWalletEU) filled just a couple thousand address with 0.1BTC. However to get to 0.1BTC they used hundreds of inputs from other addresses.
Now, they are releasing the private keys to these 2,000+ addresses at ~10minute intervals. What this means is that everyone has a chance to grab these bitcoins since the private key is known to all. Everyone can generate a transaction that sends the 0.1BTC from that address to an address they control only, at least before the first confirmation. So there is at least a 10minute window for everyone to try to generate these transactions to send the coins to themselves. The trick is, only the transaction with the highest fee will get included in the blockchain. So inevitably very little money will be made from "sweeping" these keys because someone would rather get $0.01 than nothing, and so if they see you are swiping the key worth $10, and paying $9.98 in miners fee ($0.02 profit), they will swipe for a higher fee just so they can get the $0.01, at least in theory. Additionally because these addresses were filled from hundreds of inputs, each time the address is swiped it generates a very large chain of transactions. And each address is likely to be attempted to be swiped dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands of times.
Add on to this the growing size of the memory pool (mempool for short). Bitcoin can only process 1MB worth of transactions per 10minutes. Initially we assumed that the addresses would all be swiped within the 10minute interval after they were released, but since there are so many transactions being generated by the swiping it is generating a backlog, which means it is taking much longer to get a transaction included in a block, meaning that there is more time for each address to be swiped, which creates more transactions, and an even greater backlog. It is absolutely genius.
So we should expect to see the memory pool grow to hundreds if not thousands of MB in size. Which could lead to a transaction delay of a week or more, if you don't include the appropriate fee.
This should break a few websites and apps, and hopefully both show the resilience of the network to such antics, and pave the path forward towards upgrading network capacity.
The events are unfolding mostly here:

We used "The Green Panel" I was excited about the Tesla batteries but I've been advised against them by several people. We haven't gone off-grid yet; so we are still grid tied without battery backups (well we have small backups for individual appliances but nothing comprehensive for the home). I'm hoping to invest in an off-grid battery system in the next 3 years; so hopefully there has been some development by then.

Coinbase has worked great for many people.
Bitcoin attracts a lot of different personalities. You'll see hate on one service simply because it is an identity-linked service on top of the bitcoin network. Then you'll see hate on pseudonymous services because they are "shady."
You'll see people who think 1Mb is great for all time and every other proposal is stupid. You'll see people who think 8Gb is too small and anything less is stupid. You'll see people who suggest we indefinitely continue reward subsidy of 25BTC. You'll see people claim the death of Bitcoin when the price drops $50. You'll see people claim we are on the verge of $10,000 when the price jumps up $50.
The reality is there are a lot of people with different visions for Bitcoin, AND, there are a lot of people that want to see bitcoin fail. Those who want to see bitcoin fail help egg on the fights between all the people with different visions.
My personal opinion:
Bitcoin has achieved network effect and belief in its own value that it is unlikely to disappear. Regardless of how we deal with the "blocksize" issue Bitcoin will continue on. If we never increase blocksize then maybe a sidechain will develop giant blocks. If we do increase blocksize and there is some issue I am confident we will come to consensus quickly enough to revert the changes, just as we did when the 100billion coins were created. So although I believe we are in for a bumpy ride regarding the price, I believe Bitcoin will stampede on regardless of the antics of the community, developers, or media.
If you are overinvested and can't sleep over this maybe divest a little. Otherwise hang in for the ride.

Use Multisig instead of SSSS.
Make a 2 of 3 address. A, B, C
You have "A"
You have a copy of "A" buried and/or in a safety deposit box
"B" is stored with someone you trust
another copy of "B" is stored with someone you trust
"C" is stored with someone you trust who doesn't know those who have "B"
copy of "C" is stored with another trusted person.
So in order to lose funds 4 of your copies would need to be destroyed (2 B and 2 C).
If you choose carefully such that B and C holders do not know each other and are generally well trusted it is unlikely that they will compromise you.
Even if the bank stole your "A" from a safety deposit box; they would need to know who holds B or C and then conspire with them to steal your funds.

Awesome work;
I've thought a lot about how to make physical notes without requiring any trust.
What I keep coming back to is several things:
1) The notes themselves must be a kind of hardware with GPS, and a wireless internet connection.
2) Before a note is transferred, a button is pressed which records the GPS coordinates and timestamp  of the "Hardware note" ; this information is published as part of a transaction on a 2nd, cheaper blockchain.
This cheaper blockchain would have an explorer that allows individuals to verify the chain of ownership of the physical note. 
If a potential receiver detects any bifurcations of the chain of ownership, they should request the funds to be sent as a transaction on the Bitcoin network.
The hardware note must have the private key sealed in such a way, that in order to reveal the key a special transaction on the cheaper blockchain is initiated which essentially says "This note has been spent" ; this will prevent people from acquiring notes, replicating them, spending the replicas and then sweeping the funds at a later date.

My opinions have been well researched and have benefited me extremely well over the years. I don't know anyone personally who has done better in Crypto.
 I know plenty of other people who have had a very similar outlook as you regarding Alts. A few made decent money; most of them ended up making very little. Some of them ended up owing huge tax bills far greater than any of their gains. A decent amount lost everything in scams like Bitconnect.

I was ecstatic about Bitcoin back in 2010/2011.

That was the last time I allowed myself to be swayed on any topic I have passion in. I missed out on the 2013 bull run and got involved mining and DCA'ing at the very top and have rode it out all this way.

Yes, I had been using it about twice a month for the past 18months. Over the past 2-3months I've had several orders wait for long periods, then get picked up, then days later cancelled. Basically makes it useless if you need whatever it is your are purchasing in a reasonable timeframe. I was putting in my purchases a week or more before I needed them and they almost always were delivered within 2-3days of placing the order on Purse. The last order I placed took over a month between placing the order and delivery. Because of the delay I ended up having to order off amazon directly, which obviously completely defeated the purpose of the Purse discount. I have lately been using a 15-20% discount wheareas previously I could get up to 25%.

Its either faster or cheaper.
There is always room in the next block if immediate confirmation matters to you. I don't get what is so hard to understand about that.
You can get a confirmation as fast as is possible by paying a sufficiently high fee ; or if you can get a nearly free transaction and wait a long time. Fast or Cheap. 
If BCash is ever successful it will have the exact same problem. If you really think you can increase blocksize indefinitely to solve this issue we aren't talking about decentralized permissionless networks anymore. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:28:28
If we aren't talking about confirmations, transaction times are nearly instantaneous on both chains. I don't think you actually have any experience using different Crypto's if you don't understand this. A transaction will be propagated instantly on pretty much all blockchains, including BTC.
You really don't understand how blockchains work if you think transaction without confirmation means anything at all.. Why do you think we use confirmations? Confirmation is the key to the doublespend problem.

If it is causing such chaos to businesses and users could you provide some example of outcry from those businesses and users?
Let us get back to your sacred "bar" which you said it was their intent to deprive people of their assets. A 30day backlog is a test, not an intent to deprive people of value and service. So please, where is their intent to deprive people of value and services for 30 days? Are you really so willfully ignorant as to believe a transaction would be held up for 30 days, do you have any clue how bitcoin works? Most transactions will get kicked out after 48hours. Their reference to 30day backlog is clearly in regards to the mempool, not transactions, since a transaction will not be held for more than 48hours. So will you please show me where it was there stated intent to deprive people of coins and services rather than to create a 30day memory pool backlog?
And again, could you actually provide a real world example where somebody was harmed rather than hypothetically? Bitcoin is not that huge yet. If this was Visa then sure, statistically you can assume people were harmed, but Bitcoin is not that large. Is there a single instance where somebody was deprived value from this test that you believe is worthy of tying up the courts and depriving someone of liberty over?

I've been wondering about how businesses have the power to create credit and debt, and how this ties into monetary policy as a whole.
For instance Business A creates a contract with Business B for some work to be performed that will create a profit for Business A and B.
Business B performs the work and delivers the product; but Business A doesn't pay right away, they pay Net 30 or Net 45. In the meantime Business B continues performing work for Businesses A, C, D, etc.
In this way isn't Business B extending credit and creating debt that these companies are obligated to repay?
Are there estimates for how much credit/debt exists between businesses from contracts like this?
@_date: 2016-10-13 19:08:11
Actually I think our short history has shown that the average fee has increased because of a limited transaction count, isn't that what is being experienced right now?
I guess my opinion is that if blocksize is larger than demand for transactions, then doubling the blocksize wont result in 2x as many transaction at half the fee; it might result in 1.5x as many transactions with almost no fee's.

Gold is not a trademarked term either.
You cannot open a Gold shop and tell people you are selling Gold when you are in fact selling Pyrite or some other Mineral. You can't advertise that you are selling gold but actually sell Pyrite and claim that "Pyrite is the real gold, its not trademarked its up for debate"

BCH has the same 10minute block interval as Bitcoin. The fastest a transaction can be confirmed is in the next block. You can ALWAYS get in the next block if it is worth it to you.

BCH is in fact a scam. The vast majority of altcoins including BTrash completely ignore the value proposition of Cryptocurrency. The vast majority of Crypto "assets" are created, supported, and traded by people entirely ignorant of the properties that make Bitcoin a revolution.
If my understanding of Bitcoin is correct then in the end it really wont matter as Bitcoin is an anti-fragile system whereas the vast majority of these other assets are classically fragile. The sad thing is that most people won't understand what it is about Bitcoin that is special until its too late.

When people talk about hardware wallets; the crucial difference is that a hardware wallet is a dedicated bitcoin computer that is never connected to the Internet. The hardware wallet allows you to keep your private keys off Internet facing devices.

Of course there is a million dollar opportunity every minute. If I sold at every top and bought at every bottom and timed it perfectly right I'd be 100x where I am now. On the other hand most people I know who have tried to do this have ended up very negative; whereas my simple DCA strategy has worked extremely well for me.
Eyes on the prize. Invest in what you believe in and understand. From my understanding most Alts are worthless. I'm not saying all of them are; but yes all but a small handful are. Sure you might make money trading something that is worthless; but I'd rather hold Bitcoin to $0 than trade something I don't believe in at all, and that my understanding says is not any different than amazon gift cards.

In terms of decentralization no Alts come anywhere close to Bitcoin; and I believe decentralization to be the dominant force that will allow coins to stand the test of time. There are some alts that are more centralized than others; but when compared to Bitcoin they are all horribly centralized.
There isn't a single Alt that holds a candle to Bitcoin when it comes to decentralization. Not even close.

You can double spend 0 Conf transactions. It doesn't matter if you use the in-built RBF or re-craft the transaction manually. 
0 Confirm transactions are completely insecure on any chain; BCH or otherwise. RBF is a helpful tool and has nothing to do with making 0 confirm insecure. 0 Confirm have always been insecure and vulnerable to doublespend. Thats the entire point of confirmations and the blockchain.

I see the "world" potentially heading off in multiple directions. What we have witnessed over the past century or more is the centralization and accretion of power and authority. This accretion has accelerated to Orwellian levels as of late. It is entirely possible that this centralization of power continues and a truly turn-key authoritarian civilization is formed. In this future Bitcoin could be very useful for its tracking purposes. 
On the other hand, the centralization of power may fail itself. Governments go bankrupt. People may see the farce of the nation-state and slowly dissolve nations into smaller territories. Bitcoin could be very useful in this society since it is controlled by no state; as nations collapse this currency is immune.
And then there is the far out possiblity, which is quite possible. Total global economic collapse plunges the world into a terrifying dark age. Small pockets of technology will be preserved by warlords or what remains of national military's. Most of the world will starve within a year as trade routes dry up. In this scenario owning enough land to farm, the knowledge how to do it, and resources (like fossil fuels) will be useful.

Again it is faster or cheaper; but not both. If it was worth it to you you'd have paid a higher fee to have it confirmed quicker. You can always get into the next block if you pay for it.
You can pay almost 0 fee's and your transaction will get confirmed eventually. Or you can pay a larger amount and have your transaction confirmed in the next block.

Precisely; I didn't say all alts are dead. The vast, vast majority will die; and even of the non-scam coins; most will not survive. Most Crypto "assets" are ignorant of the history of money and are not prepared for the challenges that free money will face. Bitcoin is designed to be anti-fragile. Most of these Alts would fall off the face of the Earth if their development team were imprisoned or if Crypto were outlawed.

These particular panels are warrantied to retain at least 91% maximum output for 25 years ; assuming their output doesn't drop off like a rock immediately outside the warranty we should be able to provide for our energy needs for another 10-15 years with these panels.

Before bitcoin many people argued that the principles upon which it is built would cause a currency or economy to flounder and fail. Bitcoin's continued existence and success challenges accepted notions of economics and currency management.

Lets face it, I know there are genuine miners, but lets not kid ourselves the main underlying reason miners secure transactions is greed at the end of the day.
Very few people have the opportunity to make a living for themselves doing something they truly believe in. Most people work to make money, to pay their bills, not because they are aligned with their corporations goals. Does that make them greedy?
The incentive system is why bitcoin has any value at all, Bitcoin uses peoples desire for money/power to secure the network. 
Speculators looking to make money due to the deflationary schedule add value that allows the miners to continue expanding and increasing the hashrate.
At the end of the day it comes down to beliefs about human psychology. Why do people do anything at all? It can be argued that all behavior is either seeking reward or retreating from pain. Even "altruistic behavior" is usually accompanied by an internal reward, does that mean a person can only truly be altruistic when they receive no satisfaction from behaving that way?
I'm no Gordon Gecko, I'm not going to say that Greed is good, it is clearly not. However we must recognize that greed is a natural (perhaps the most natural) human motivator. Therefore we can attempt to create systems that use peoples natural tendency for greed to secure the system rather than be a liability for the system.
Consider a private blockchain made by the banks. A private chain and each member bank is given "minting/mining" keys that allows them to create currency at will. The incentive for the banking system as a whole is to play nice and not cheat this system. However individuals with access to the mining keys may find themselves being incentivized by rogue banks or black market participants more than they are incentivized by the banking system itself. With no proof-of-work and relying on secret keys these private blockchains and their secret keys if they ever became valuable would be immense targets. If someone got a hold of the mining keys they may be able to create $1000 trillion and distribute them as they see fit, imploding the financial system as we know it.
Bitcoin on the other hand allows anyone to mine blocks and secure transactions, whoever "hacks" the hash first wins. Everyone can participate and it is impossible to cheat. There are no secret mining keys that produce coins from nothing. I really hope the banks do not move forward with their private blockchains as they are creating the incentive for financial Armageddon. 
So yes, peoples incentives can bias their behavior, but acting on incentive is not in itself wrong. It can be wrong when self gain is considered more important than the losses of others.

Think of it this way;
Bad news has been hammering away for months and in spite of that the demand as evidenced by the price continues to grow.
Bitcoin being so small and so finite encourages huge price appreciation with small organic growth. 
It has been around for 8 years now; survived two halvings; survived thefts, heists, and many a scandal. It has thus far survived and remain unchanged by the scaling civil war.
Bitcoin is the most trusted; most recognized digital asset that exists. As the network effect grows and makes more people aware of Bitcoin; just small numbers of people investing will push the price higher.
I really think that is a major part of the design; once people realize the utility of Bitcoin it can easily appreciate to astronomical heights. As people become aware of this it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Though I don't think you should second guess your decision to sell half; as we all know this is still an experiment that could fail; so taking profits when you are too anxious is a very healthy thing I think.

Sorry I've done my research and been in this space for quite some time. 
I'll restate my conclusions; the vast, vast majority of altcoins are worthless and don't have any of the properties that make Bitcoin revolutionary.
Most altcoins will die and be gone forever. A small number, less than 0.1% will survive the next decade. 
Most alts are glorified gift cards.

What happens if the global financial system is moved over to a private blockchain and then the mining/signing keys gets leaked or hacked? It would seem that a centralized blockchain has enormous liability and responsibility with regards to protecting the secret keys.

I'm not arguing in favor of net neutrality or government regulation of the Internet; but I am pointing out that without it; Bitcoin may need to mask its traffic.
If we could get rid of all regulations on ISP's I think that would make everything a much more level playing field by making the barrier to entry much lower and spurring on healthy competition. However there is also the reality that we live in an environment where ISP's are given exclusive contracts over regions by Governments that prevent competition.

Trading firms that place their servers closest to the trading engines in the NYSE enjoy advantages over firms further away. Being closer means their signals reach the trading engine microseconds faster than traders farther away. They can use this time advantage to bait the market with many small buy and sell orders at the best market prices. When their algorithm detects a likely large buy or sell (due to their bait) they use the difference in time your order takes as it propagates from the "bait exchange" with a small number of shares at the best market price, to the larger exchanges at higher prices, to buy up the available supply (or if a sell order, sell their supply). Or simply take advantage of arbitrage from volatility over the few microseconds of ownership.
It would be like going to the supermarket to buy apples, and the moment you start inspecting the apples, another customer comes over blocks the path and buys up all the apples, then offers them to you for 10% more. The store not only tolerates this, but offers room and board for their clients that engage in this behavior.
Larger sized blocks will mean an increased propagation times between nodes. Can the different propagation intervals to various nodes be taken advantage of in similar ways? 
If so larger blocks would incentivize miners to physically and geographically aggregate.
We have to balance our scaling options with the vision of decentralized store of value. The immutable blockchain; maintained by decentralized miners; recording verifiable transactions of digital gold, these are the most important and revolutionary aspects of Bitcoin that must never be tampered with.
Bitcoin has value despite government backing. Visa, Paypal, WU, their networks are concerned with recording transactions that have value by decree. Bitcoin has no decree, its value is maintained by its unique properties.

Private blockchains if widely used as the backbone of finance, will result in financial Armageddon.
How valuable those secret mining keys will be. The ability to create money is dependent upon access to a secret key. Who gets access to these keys? How is it ensured that they are never leaked or hacked?
What can be done if the keys are leaked and 100x more money is created than existed prior to the leak?
Private blockchains will not secure global finance. It is the antithesis of security to have the entire system have a single point of failure. 
People couldn't even keep the Blu-ray decryption key secret. These mining keys will be so many orders of magnitude more valuable they will not stay secret for long. 
Bitcoin allows anyone who can prove they worked to secure the chain gets to create blocks and receive reward. 
A bankchain is secured through obscurity. There will be no mining competition, even if they employ PoW. At best they could keep their alorgithm secret for a while so even if you got the secret key you'd need hashing power on their algorithm to use it. But what incentive will there be for banks to compete for hash power to continuously make it more difficult for attackers?
 
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:47:16
It is kind of a bootstrapping effect. 
Less blockspace = higher fee's and less transactions.
Ideally we want the fee pressure to climb high enough that if/when the blocksize is increased the floor doesn't fall out of the fee market. In this way there would be more overall fee's even if the average fee has dropped. The main question is, how do we accurately determine where this point is? If we wait too long we risk losing potential new users, but if we increase too soon we will just have 2x the transactions and basically no fee's, potentially hurting miners.

You are literally making stuff up that you clearly don't understand.
Confirmations occur when your transaction is included in a block. Block times adjust to an average of 10minute intervals. The concept that on average BCH transactions are confirmed in seconds betrays your total ignorance on this topic.

Its not societal change that is required. The particular way money is issued out of debt represents an unsustainable protocol. All that is required for the Bitcoin protocol to succeed is that society does nothing to address the current Fiat protocol.

Bitcoin market prices are highly self-similar. Zoom in; zoom out; change the dates; you will recognize the same patterns repeat over and over and over again. Patterns within patterns; patterns on various timescales.
You can't use the patterns to predict the future; except to say that it is a certainty that the future chart will be self-similar with the past chart.

But if it weren't for the FED and central banks behaviors would there have been as much passion for Bitcoin? 
The FED, IMF, Central Banks, Governments, are the enemies Bitcoin needs to thrive. If they didn't act the way they do, would we really need Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:32:25
I'm still learning, could you elaborate on the differences?
I thought that low latency strategies are routinely and widely used in order to front run ones clients. By taking advantage of relative latencies an order takes as it propagates between exchanges a trader with a superior low latency access can receive your signal on one exchange, anticipate how your signal will propagate to another exchange, and beat your signal to the 2nd exchange with a low latency connection. Essentially giving low latency traders privileged knowledge of the demand/supply of financial products within a couple millisecond window.

In general those trading on emotion based on current price movements; rather than predefined decision matrix will lose massively.
A decision matrix is just something an investor creates for themselves in advance to help weather through these rollercoaster times. Something like:
If price goes to X I sell Y coins; or If Price goes to X I buy Y Coins
My decision matrix is simple; I just buy a small amount regularly; unless there is a real existential risk to Bitcoin I just let it ride. So far has been a good strategy.

If they are buying more than they can afford to lose; then yes they are stupid.
We may be at the top of a bubble. We might be at the foothills of a bubble. We might just be experiencing real growth. People that are investing purely because of the price action are stupid; yes. Buying or selling based on the movement of the price is exactly how people lose money; and exactly what professional traders are betting on to make money.

It is really hard to say. Even if the new daily supply by miners is small compared to total volume, it still represents a downward pressure on the price. Someone must buy 1800 coins everyday at current market price or the price will decrease. If there is a demand for 1million coins per day, and 996400 are supplied by existing holders and 3600 are supplied by miners, the price stabilizes. If demand remains at 1million coins per day and 996400 are supplied by existing holders and 1800 supplied by miners, there is a 1800 coin gap between what is being sold and what people want to buy. This will cause the price to increase until it scares off some demand and then stabilize.

And just wait until one of the individuals responsible for maintaining the mining keys decides it is more valuable to allow themselves to get "hacked" and the key leaked to the black market.
They will have to come up with some serious security protocols to keep those keys out of human hands.
Private Blockchains are an enormous liability to all that use them.

Faster OR Cheaper; not both. Block times on both chains target 10minutes.
You can always get your transaction included in the very next block if you pay the right fee.
Btrash is either faster, or cheaper, but not both. You can't get any faster than next block; and both chains use the same 10minute window.

You will want a dedicated; offline only computer to hold your private keys and sign your transactions.
The easiest way is a hardware wallet; but then you have to trust the wallet manufacturer.
My recommendation is to use a RaspberryPi 2 (Not 3 it has built in WiFi).
Use a raspberryPi2; with a wallet like Electrum. Generate your keys offline and never bring it online. In the Electrum wallet there will be an option to display your master public key. 
On your Online Computer that you will spend from; create a Watch Only Electrum wallet. When it asks for addresses to watch; enter the master public key.
Now your Online PC can keep track of your Bitcoins and it can craft transactions. When you actually want to spend; you will save a transaction to a USB drive; then insert the USB drive to the RaspberryPi; and then "Load Transaction from file" ; at this point you will be given the option to Sign it and then save it back to the USB drive. 
Then take the USB drive out of the Pi and put it in your Online Computer; again in Electrum "Load Transaction from file" and then you'll have the option to broadcast!

It is just my personal favorite; and the one I am most experienced with.
I've worked with Mycellium, Armory, Core Wallet/Node, BreadWallet; as well as several web based wallets. Electrum is my personal favorite for ease of use; feels intuitive to me; but you should try several and find which you like the best.
I would not recommend Armory or Bitcoin Core Wallet/Node; If you want to run a node (which is recommended) it is better to run a node separate from your Private keys.

Now we are talking!
I wouldn't say that I necessarily characterize all these things (government, corporations, academia) as being "bad" in themselves. It is their role on the individual and society at large that is often "bad"
All these entities are brought into existence to fulfill some kind of need or purpose. However once brought into existence they often have enough power, momentum, and public trust to deviate significantly from their original purposes.
The masses of people need some kind of hierarchy, but not necessarily national governments. Governments gain too much power and act outside the interests of their people. The people have little recourse.
Corporations, the biggest problem I have with them is their involvement in the government. Regulations, subsidies, and numerous forms of redtape designed to protect the public ends up just creating barriers of entry for competition without any meaningful protection. It also creates a false sense of security instead of a buyer beware atmosphere. FDA approves drugs that must be later recalled, but most people don't hesitate to prescribe or take FDA approved medication.
Academia is only bad in so much that it is so narrow and naive. It is not isolated from the world that it studies, and the direction that projects and research goes in is determined by funding. So much funding in Academia comes from the government or the defense industry.
Which leads into Bitcoin
Bitcoin will not solve all of the worlds problems. It will however strike at the heart of the modern war-surveillance-propaganda machine. War is profitable because money is created out of debt. This debt is being passed on to younger and future generations. The surveillance and propaganda machines are used to ensure that war remains popular and profitable.
A Bitcoin based monetary system wouldn't mean there is never war. It would however reduce the scope of most wars. A country couldn't wage a war if it didn't have enough savings, unless it could get a loan. And why would a country get a loan to go to war unless the spoils of the war were worth more than the total cost of the loan?
Bitcoin doesn't solve human greed, violence, or stupidity, but it does limit it.
I'd be happy to elaborate further, thanks for the discussion!
EDIT: And what is "good" ? A much more difficult question that has been a focus of philosophy for thousands of years. To me what is "good" is the ability of an individual to engage in the world in any way they so please, except in ways that harm others. Obviously this leads into a discussion of what harm to others is, is it physical, economical, spiritual, emotional? Everybody has different beliefs about what is good to them and harmful to them. This is precisely why I do not support national or global governments. Different people have different beliefs about how they want to be ruled and what works within a cultural belief system. We need a plurality of city-states; tens of thousands of them. The development of atomic weapons has obviously shoehorned the world into a few sovereign entities that can maintain these weapons programs. Personally I don't see any hope for staving off a global disaster that will end with mass starvation of 3-6 billion people. In my opinion it is likely to start through an economic accident that ripples through supply chains, then leading into local and global battles.

Can somebody explain why mining companies are not becoming electricity generators?
If Bitcoin were to appreciate significantly I plan to start mining with solar power. I'd consider the solar panels a sunk cost and then mining bitcoin would simply be the cost of the maintenance on the solar panels. I suppose if mining became less profitable you could then sell your excess power to the grid, if you were into that kind of thing.

I haven't used Trezor recovery ; but when I have reconstituted from seeds before the order certainly was not random. Is the ordering of the words really random with Trezor; doesn't that increase collision potential?
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:32:54
That is interesting. I am curious why the seed ever needs to touch an internet facing PC at all. 
Say for instance you have an entirely offline, airgapped, Linux computer; running off a USB stick; that is only used for signing transactions. 
You have a watch only wallet on the internet facing PC; and if you ever lose your airgapped signing computer; couldn't you just make a new one and reconstitute from seed offline? 
If you lost both the watch only wallet and airgapped signing computer; shouldn't you be able to recover from seed completely offline; and then use the master public key to watch all your addresses online?
The device that does that actual signing should never have to touch an internet facing device. Am I missing something?

100% of mined coins are sold at market price. 
A miner either sells their coins or chooses to keep them. When they make the choice to keep them, they are essentially buying them at market price. By holding any mined coins they are saying "I believe these are worth more than the market is offering" , which is the same thing that happens when a speculator purchases and hodls bitcoin.
The exponentially increasing difficulty mining bitcoin keeps "profitability" somewhat spurty at best. Miners go out of business all the time when difficulty jumps, as it almost always does every 2 weeks.
@_date: 2016-05-04 11:56:51
It is almost like you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about if you are confusing negative interest rates with inflation.
We're trying to build something better over here. Stick to your playground where the authorities tell you what is true and false, what is right and wrong.
When I was getting my degree I never understood what all the angst against "Academia." I didn't think there was a difference between the "real world" and the world I was taught to believe in through education. When you get out in the "real world" (if you ever do) You'll see that there is an enormous disconnect between your academic beliefs about the way the world functions, and the way it actually functions.
Part of the problem is that academia rewards narrow specialists over polymaths.
Before you "contribute" to the global phenomenon that is Bitcoin, it would serve you well to educate yourself on the diverse histories and cultures of the world. Not by reading books written by westerners "describing" or "summarizing" other cultures, but by actually experiencing these cultures, reading works, art, entertainment within the cultural perspective. Understand the economic and political forces that have radically changed the structure of the world since the industrial revolution.
In academia you start to get this belief that there is one true history of humanity, one true path of progress for the human race. Those who are not on this path are opposed to progress and science and efficiency. That the world might as well be ruled by one set of laws that everybody everyone must abide by, because there is only one truth, and one right way of justice. 
You probably do not even realize the extent to which you support Authoritarian control structures. That is ok, most people do not. It is unfortunate that even people coming from what is respected as a beacon of intelligence do not even understand the role in the world that they are playing. And if you do understand, that makes it even worse.
Have fun wasting your time on these projects. Nobody will adopt them. Your team will be laughed out of history for making such an ignorant and backwards attempt on the Bitcoin protocol, and for thinking you could flagrantly advertise without opposition.
Why don't you go work on AML KYC for cash? Your work will be much more accepted in authoritarian circles. Oh wait, the authorities don't trust you to alter their protocol so you've come to Bitcoin to peddle your code. 
Shameful. This will not reflect well on MIT.

Bitcoin is a complete revolution of value and it is absolutely being attacked left and right by individuals and institutions that will lose if Bitcoin continues to succeed. 
If you believe that because Reddit stores our posts for free on centralized servers that that means that Bitcoin can store transactions for free (or "cheap") while maintaining decentralization, immutability, and permissionless transactions then you do not understand Bitcoin.
If you do understand Bitcoin then I can only assume that you would like to attempt to harm it; because that will be the effect of cheap onchain transactions.
There are literally hundreds of other coins that have already sacrificed their core values for scaling capacity. The only reason you are here is because Bitcoin is the leader; and Bitcoin is the leader precisely because it has not given in like all the other coins.
You want cheap; onchain transactions; on a secure blockchain. You can have cheap transactions with Dogecoin; but nobody wants to transact in dogecoin. You can have cheap transactions with Ether, Litecoin, pretty much any coin. People want transactions on a secure, immutable ledger. And that is precisely what makes those transactions valuable is the immutability.

This is a vulnerability; though relatively small.
Something you can do to help prevent this is to Format the USB drive such that there is only enough space to write 1 transaction to it. So you could format your USB drive to be 20kb or something tiny. Big enough for a very large transaction; but small enough that malicious programs would need to be very efficient.
This will make it more difficult for a virus to write itself to the USB drive; but it doesn't preclude the possibility the PC is infected with a virus that changes the details of the transaction; sending the coins to the attackers address. This can be prevented by simply double checking the transaction details before you sign or broadcast.

Another crisis is guaranteed; what is uncertain is how long the can will be kicked. Could be another hundred years of can-kicking. Personally I think we are nearing the end of the post WWII paradigm.
I see Bitcoin being used as a Phoenix strategy by debtor nations. Buy it up in secret while demonizing it; then print a ton of money and pay off debts/increase the price of Bitcoin. Then declare a new national currency based on Bitcoin. Wait 20-40 years; then declare that the economy needs a flexible currency not hard-linked to finite assets like Bitcoin. Presto-Chango Neo-Fiat is born!

Billions are spent on surveillance, tracking down the creator of what may be the most disruptive invention of the 21st century and his hundreds of millions - billions in wealth would seem within the scope of intelligence agencies.
Personally I think these "outings" are a lame attempt to get Satoshi to come forward him/herself. If the media can convince the world to give credit to someone else for your invention, you may feel compelled to set the record straight. In doing so you would likely reveal important information that could jeopardize your future.

When you need to make transactions you simply save your Tx to a USB stick; plug it into your never online Signing computer; Sign the Tx; save to USB; transfer USB to online computer and broadcast.
No keys ever touch the internet. Wallet can always be recovered from seed.
The greatest risk with this is that somebody discovers your seed; you can always encrypt it (but introduce the risk of forgetting the decrypt); or you could go through greater lengths to conceal it.
Personally I believe that a 3 tiered system would be the most secure.
1) Small amount of funds on Hot wallet; easy to spend; easy to lose
2) Intermediate amount of funds on a Multi-Sig hardware wallet; with keys generated offline. Funds are moved from this wallet to hot wallet as needed.
3) Long term Storage. This is another Multi-sig wallet that you cannot access alone. This would be a 2 of 3 wallet or even a 3 of 3 wallet. You have one seed; you give one (the same one) to trusted friends/family. The third seed you keep in a safety deposit box. Whenever you want to spend from this wallet you must physically travel to get the needed seed. This is quite low risk in my opinion; your biggest risk is if the bank turned criminal and they knew the details of your storage; they could go to your trusted friend/family that has another key and steal funds from you that way. I think that is exceptionally unlikely.

This might be one of few deserved Nobel prizes in economics.
People are often awarded for their untestable theories and explanations of economies and financial behavior. At least "Satoshi" created an entire economic paradigm.

Bitcoin will be used to replace the debt based economy. It could be China and Russia that trigger it; but really even the US would benefit. 
If any major nation goes Bitcoin it will be game over for fiat. 
My bet would be that either major allied countries buy in; in secret; slowly over time. Then when the time is right announce that we are transitioning away from debt-based fiat (and what a relief; just as the US can no longer pay its debts we stop using debt based currency.)
If that doesn't happen then I would imagine States will dig their heels in and fight Bitcoin until their last dying breath. It will be a futile fight so I'm betting on strategy number 1

From what it looks like the new method requires that the Trezor is connected to an internet facing PC in order to recover. It looks like they applied some randomizer to the hardware buttons so that everytime you enter a letter the buttons scramble; so that if the PC is listening to the signals from the buttons they wont be able to correlate to a single keypad; kind of reminds me of the Enigma.

Personally I believe that we can best implement all the potential use cases that Cryptocurrency may enable by not trying to force one coin to do it all.
Other coins can find niche use cases; and if another coin is able to find a way to scale while maintaining decentralization, immutability, and permisionless transactions; then that coin may come to dominance. 
I think some alts have real value; many are probably in a bubble; but there is some real value there that the market is trying to determine.

Your hardware wallet should be encrypted; so if it is stolen the attacker will need to decrypt it. 
While the attacker is trying to bruteforce it; you can re-constitute your wallet on a new computer by inputting the ~12 word seed phrase. Then you can transfer your funds to a brand new wallet so that the attacker is SOL.
A backup Hardware wallet would simply be a cloned SD card. You could make 100 cloned SD cards that contain your wallet seed. But in practice it makes more sense to store your seed on paper; or stamped into metal. It is easier and cheaper to make copies of your seed on paper; but it is more difficult to encrypt.
If you and you alone have the seed then you will be able to get your Bitcoin back. 
At the end of the day it comes down to protecting your seed. The seed is your Bitcoin. The hardware wallet exists to keep your seed off the internet. Writing it down on paper means that if you lose the hardware wallet you can get your coins back.
Multisignature Hardware wallet is just slightly more complicated.
So instead of signing your transaction once; you sign your transaction with multiple keys. So instead of having one seed; you will have multiple seeds; multiple hardware wallets.
You can geographically distribute the keys; which means even if someone tried to rob you; you literally could not give them the coins. They would need to rob you and however many people are necessary to sign the transaction.
MultiSig makes your Coins exponentially more secure because now your attacker needs 2 or more keys to send funds. This also helps protect against potential collision attacks. While a single collision is unfathomably unlikely; having two collisions that make up the same multisig wallet is unimaginably more unlikely.

If we are going to compare to Reddit then it should be pointed out that Reddit has far greater downtime compared to the Bitcoin network. While the Bitcoin network has not suffered any downtime in years; Reddit being run on centralized servers goes down and is regularly inaccessible. Even with all the congestion on the Blockchain; you can always get in if you pay a high enough fee; and because of decentralization the network is NEVER down. Can't say that for Reddit; Paypal, or any centralized service.
If we are comparing to Reddit; we should also remember the biggest difference; the data stored by Reddit is completely mutable. It can be changed without much difficulty at all. The data stored by the blockchain is immutable.
The fact that you are making this comparison demonstrates your lack of understanding on this subject. Reddit servers in no way replicate what Bitcoin nodes do; and the fact that you think the two are comparable means you either don't understand Bitcoin or you are acting to destroy the principles of Bitcoin.

At the point that you actually have consistently full 32mb blocks you'll have increased the cost of running a node to be completely prohibitive for pretty much anyone in the US. Even with 1MB blocks I bump into my 1TB/month datacap occasionally. 
So in order to get lower fee's than Bitcoin (but higher than Visa) you'll have a completely centralized currency whose parameters can be changed on the whim of a few dozen node operators/miners. 
So it will be more expensive than CC's and just as centralized and ripe for corruption.

If we do see the hyperbitcoinization event that many are predicting I wonder how sharp the curve will be.
I was thinking about it, and if we do go through another period where Bitcoin's value increases substantially over several months we may see the floodgates open in terms of merchant acceptance.
There may be an inflection point where miners no longer see the need to sell any Bitcoin since they can then pay their electricity, bills, and entertainment all with Bitcoin. With the value constantly increasing relative to the dollar it will disincentivize selling Bitcoins for Dollars except at a premium, further increasing the value of Bitcoin. We may reach an inflection point where it simply doesn't make sense for miners to trade their Bitcoin for dollars. Unlike stocks or gold Bitcoin can be used directly for buying goods and services, which eliminates the need to "cash out." It could end up being a slow upwards curve, suddenly followed by a very sharp nearly asymptotic trend.

Nothing wrong with Freemasons, Bavarian Illuminati, OTO, the Rosicrucian, or any of the Gnostic or Hermetic societies.

I think you summed up the divergent views pretty well with this post here. 
We are discussing redefining the concept of wealth and value. Do you really think it is responsible to make the basis of all wealth and value on the planet to hinge on our hopes that Moores law continues?
I am a huge fan of Moores law; the Singularity; all that Jazz. But that is all hopeful thinking. There is no guarantee that we wont run into hard walls that cause progress to stall for decades.
Bitcoin represents Humanities greatest chance of a sustainable future. I'm not willing to risk all of that so people can make transactions through Bitcoin Blockchain that they already have no problem making otherwise.
Would it be great if there were no fee's? Of course; but thats not realistic.
The Blockchain is valuable. It is valuable because it is decentralized. By increasing the number of records per second available on the blockchain we diminish its decentralization. We decrease the value of the records not only because the supply of records is greater but because the records themselves are less valuable because it is less decentralized.
Bitcoin is valuable because there are tens of thousands of copies of your transaction all crosschecking crossreferencing each other. If it is all just a single database; or a consortium of a few dozen databases the records have no more value than PayPal or credit card records.

Good idea; incentivizing nodes is exactly what SegWit will allow. People will be able to become Hubs and collect fee's for processing transactions. This can certainly improve decentralization. Then maybe once we have a functioning incentive system for nodes it will be appropriate to increase the blocksize since we wont be relying on altruism to support the network.

If your are 100% sure of how the price is going to play out you should max out your credit; take out a 2nd mortgage; and buy leveraged options.

It is a well researched opinion. Only time will tell if its irrefutable.
Nobody is infallible. If you understand and believe in certain alts; go for it. 
As to your statement about making more money in alts vs BTC; I would highly disagree with that. 
Most alts will crash and burn to 0. Some will go up 100000%; and then crash to 0. Very few will survive long term.
So of course if you know when to get in and when to get out you can make more money in alts. The same could be said of any market. Penny stocks can go up 10000% too. Doesn't make them interesting to me or revolutionary in any way.

A PoW change to protect the chain from blockwithholding attacks from malicious miners.
If BIP148 receives a minority hashrate malicious miners could devote significant resources to mine BIP148 and withhold blocks to hurt the chain. For instance say after the chain split honest miners mine 10 blocks each published at the time they are found. Now say a dishonest miner has been mining with a much greater hashrate and holding all blocks back for themselves. If the dishonest miner mined 11 blocks in the time it took all honest miners to mine 10 blocks; then when the dishonest miner publishes their 11 blocks; it will erase every transaction that occured in the 10blocks mined by honest miners and replace it with whatever is in those 11blocks.
The only way to protect from this is to change the PoW so that the hardware of the dishonest miner is useless against the new chain.

There is a difference between what is traded and what is absorbed by long term holders.
Certainly there are what around 16million BTC in "circulation" right now and 1800 is nothing compared to that. However those 3600 mined everyday do create a downward pressure on the price, and decreasing that pressure by 1800 BTC per day will absolutely have an affect on the price. It may not happen immediately, but if people continue spending the same amount of USD on BTC the price will have to move. It doesn't mean it has to move astronomically, but if all else holds equal, the price will have to rise somewhat by December 2016.
What I expect to happen is that large Mining operations have been holding on to coins for a few months. They are holding a greater percentage of their coins as they approach the halving so that by the halving they are already operating on 50% revenue. Then they'll begin selling off their stashed coins into the halving hype.
So the price I expect to continue to rise until and maybe shortly after the halving, at which point I expect a significant correction as miners sell off all those coins. Finally after this activity has calmed down the effect of reduced newly available supply will finally be felt ~6months post halving. Obviously this is pure speculation !RemindMe 6months

It seems that we fundamentally do not share the same vision of what Bitcoin is or what it represents.
The fact that a small minority can stop changes is exactly what gives Bitcoin power. 
Bitcoin can only be changed with near unanimous consensus. 
A small group can veto changes; but a small group cannot implement changes. This means that change only happens when something is so overwhelming obvious that nearly everyone agrees. Scenarios in which 95%+ of participants agree on anything is very rare; which means that Bitcoin will rarely change. 
Bitcoin will remain unchanged; immutable; forever unless there is near unanimous consensus; and that is a good thing. 
There are plenty of coins that have no issue being led by majority rule. If Bitcoin simply changes by the whims of the majority; and other coins change by the whims of majority; eventually wont they all share the exact same properties?
Bitcoin sets itself apart not only by being the first; but by being the most stubborn; the most change resistant.
If Bitcoin can be changed by majority politics; then it is impossible that Bitcoin is immune to State level attacks. The State has enormous resources and thousands of years of experience playing politics. If Bitcoin submits to politics it is dead in the water.
Other coins can submit to politics; if they discover something so groundbreaking that nearly all Bitcoin participants believe it is a good thing; then it will be implemented. If Bitcoin is a consensus based system, then the worst that a State level attack can do is prevent Bitcoin from changing. If Bitcoin is a politically mutable system; the State can completely dismantle it.

Interesting observation
Feel free to disagree with my line of reasoning and I'd honestly be happy to have a greater understanding if you would care to dispute my logic. Which boils down to bitcoin being an asset with extremely finite supply. Combined with the fact it is the first major asset where direct ownership can be transferred without an intermediary. These two properties combined with declining markets, currency anxieties, and a Bitcoin media Hype cycle initiated by significant rise in price.  I'm not saying it is a certainty but it certainly seems like a possibility to me.

Here is a speculation I have not seen before.
Bitcoin was created by a group a new money Billionaires to free their wealth from the confines of the State/Banks (Old Money)
The goal is to eventually be able to move their money into Bitcoin to free it from outside control. Imagine being a billionaire and still being told what you can and cannot do with your money. Having to trust that banks don't simply freeze your account because you fell out of disfavor with the current political class.
Anyways; the goal is to move their money into Bitcoin once it has reached the level of stability/adoption necessary to ensure its continued success.
In this scenario it becomes easier for Satoshi to be so austere; he/she/them are already brilliantly wealthy. In all likely hood the plan is to never spend them; or use them to dump on and destroy any fork that doesn't go along with their vision for Bitcoin.
When Bitcoin reaches critical mass these Billionaires will move over the bulk of their wealth. Right now its too small; every time they bought a house or spent large amounts on business ventures it would cause the market to crash. The market must mature.

In Econ 101 you learn basic concepts like supply and demand as well.
3600 new coins are absorbed by the market each day in order to keep the price stable.
After the halving only 1800 new coins will flood the market.
If the demand stays the same and the available supply drops by 1800 coins per day, all else being equal, the price would shift higher to find new equilibrium.
Certainly many people have tried to price this in. However people are also pricing in potential doomsday scenarios where the miners enter a downward spiral. We don't know exactly what will happen after the halving (besides less new coins per day). 
I would be shocked if the next 6 months are not the most volatile Bitcoin has seen in years.

It is possible of course that this really is a malicious attempt to takeover the network by either fools or State actors; but I don't suspect that to be the case.

Each person would see what appears to be an untampered note and checking the blockchain reveals the funds are still available. Then after spending their 10 copies, they redeem the private key, or maybe they never redeem the key so they keep on printing notes.

Depends on what you mean by VISA scale.
If you mean 100GB blocks then its going to be ridiculous. The cost to run custom fibre to your home, the ongoing bandwidth costs, and then of course a machine that can validate tens of thousands of transactions per second is going to be an extremely powerful machine. A couple thousand a month for maintenance; probably $100k - $250k to get setup; maybe more depending on how long the fibre needs to be run.
Or we could work on 2nd layer solutions and keep the network decentralized somewhat. 
I think many believe that if 2nd layer solutions cannot allow Bitcoin to be used by the masses then we should consider increasing the blocksize.

It sounds like you know what you're talking about.
I would have thought about it a bit different though.
For instance if your Buy-in price of BTC is $300; and the price of BTC + BCC ends up being $3000 ($2700 + $300) and you sell 1 BCC; that would be a gain of $270 and the purchase date of BTC would determine whether that was long term or short term.
But I really don't know; tax rules don't necessarily make sense are can be quite arbitrary.

Giving precise numbers in specific timelines is almost impossible. 
There is so much that can happen in 3 years.
What is certain is that there is a max of 21Million Bitcoins (with millions lost or unspendable).
There are 7Billion People on the Planet; around $50 Trillion of M2 wealth globally.
If Bitcoin continues to prove itself to be a superior store of value than anything else; it will become like a snowballing avalanche.
It is plausible that we will not be measuring the value of Bitcoin in dollars in 10-20 years. In fact based on my (probably flawed) understanding I would wager to bet that if Bitcoin still exists in 20 years; that we will not be measuring its value in fiat currencies.
So what could the value be in 2020? I don't know
But I would be shocked if Bitcoin is still around and is worth less than $100k by 2030.

How do the exchanges have control over "the whole system" ?
The exchanges have nothing to do with the operation of the blockchain. When there were only a handful of exchanges they certainly had more power to manipulate the market, but with dozens of exchanges distributed on multiple continents, I have a hard time understanding how the exchanges have control over the blockchain, much less "The Whole System"
I'm not sure where you get the idea that 90% of mining power is physically located in China. Several large pool operators *live* in China. There are certainly large farms in China, but even Chinese miners are opening mines in places like Iceland.
Even so, pools are not miners and this confusion betrays your lack of understanding. Pools are composed of thousands, tens of thousands of individual miners. These individuals have demonstrated in the past that individual miners have loyalty to the blockchain and not their "pool". See GHash.io

You should first ask yourself; what is the benefit of using and holding Bitcoin over Paypal money. 
Then ask yourself; how is Bitcoin different than the Liberty Dollar or any of the other systems of private money invented in the last hundred years.
Here is my Opinion:
Bitcoins value comes from several places; but ultimately its value hinges on Bitcoins network remaining sovereign above any group or individual. If Bitcoin can be changed or altered by any entity outside of overwhelming consensus then it is no different than Fiat money whose properties can be changed by a few individuals. 
By increasing the blocksize we are necessarily increasing the costs to run a node. As costs to participate increase; decentralization decreases. As decentralization decreases it becomes easier and easier to divide and conquer and ultimately control Bitcoin. 
The battle for private sound money is centuries old. All other forms have been ruthlessly attacked and destroyed by the State. 
What we have already achieved with Bitcoin is revolutionary. Bitcoin certainly could be improved; but even if it never upgraded or never changed Bitcoin as it is right now will change the world forever.
Considering my belief that we have already achieved revolutionary success that is just waiting for consciousness to catch up to; it would seem imprudent to risk the properties I believe give Bitcoin value in order to make transactions less expensive.

That said, in terms of investment opportunity, mining is more of a gamble than buying outright. Mining is more like starting a business than investing. You will be competing with all the other mining businesses which have a lot more expertise. You'll be joining one of the most competitive industries in existence.

Like I said, the sky isn't falling. 
Resistance to change is one of the strengths of Bitcoin. 
The monetary incentive is there, if we get into a situation where this seriously impacts Bitcoins economics negatively, I feel confident that changes will be adopted rather quickly.
I'd rather Bitcoin wait to change factors that affect its economics in the face of Emergency, rather than change in anticipation of emergencies that never come to pass. I believe it is a good precedent that Bitcoin only makes changes that affect its economics when absolutely forced to.
I think that time may be approaching. Once the minimum mempool is greater than 4mb over a 60 day period, I think we'll be ready.

My goal isn't to create a huge transaction backlog; I'm more interested to see how exchanges handle having their reserves depleted. Maybe everything will run smoothly and no exchanges have issues. Maybe it causes extreme volatility as exchanges settle up with each other.

Some people have suggested that unspent transaction outputs older than 10 years to be made mineable again in the future. Highly controversial, and I wouldn't be for it. 
Most likely (and hopefully) lost coins are essentially destroyed. This increases the value of the coins left in circulation. Bitcoins being divisible by 100million units will not have a problem with "lost coins" until the value of a Bitcoin is greater than $1M USD(2016) when 1 satoshi will equal $0.01 USD. More zeroes can be added to the end if absolutely necessary, but probably wouldn't be necessary until the price is quite astronomical.

I've heard it argued both ways. Initially I thought there would be a large drop because I imagined that miners have been holding an increasing percentage of coins leading up to the halving to help buffer the effects of reduced revenue.
However I've also heard that many miners have been essentially "shorting" bitcoin to cover potential losses. Basically they get a loan for bitcoins, sell them now, and if the price goes down, buy it back and pocket the cash. If the price goes up too much they lose a bit, but since they are mining it can recover it without too much loss.
It will be very interesting to see how these different strategies play out and which ones are more dominant after the halving.
The true effects of the halving I believe will take place around December of 2016.

Bitcoin to me is all about not having to trust others. You will want to research the key principles behind Public/Private Cryptography. I take a lot of steps that many would argue are unnecessary ; but it provides me peace of mind.
The important points when making generating keys is that:
1) It is done on a computer that is never/ will never connect to the internet (like a RasperryPi)
2) The software you are using is not compromised/ the random number generator is operating properly
3) Use a variety of inks, paper, and media to write or stamp your seed.
Finally for extra security 
Utilize Mutli-Sig ; require multiple signatures to move funds and keep keys geographically distributed. This way even if someone has a gun to your head you cannot move funds without physically traveling to multiple other locations.
Utilize master public keys to manage your funds safely; craft transactions online; sign with offline, never internet connected devices.
With Freedom comes Responsibility.

Institutional investors need a much higher Bitcoin price before they will jump in significantly.
Sure some individual investors that work for these big institutions will invest for themselves; but these institutions cannot invest significantly in Bitcoin with its marketcap so small.
Say Goldman Sachs wants to invest $500million. It would take forever to invest that money without major slippage. 
Bitcoin is volatile because it is so small. If a large institution were to invest; the price would rise astronomically; but if it was higher than the demand from the rest of the market; the price would just crash back down. That is a huge risk to take with $100's of millions of dollars.
Institutions must invest very slowly and carefully into Bitcoin until it gets large enough to absorb millions without slippage. 
So you are right that the institutional investors are not here; but it doesn't have anything to do with current drama in the market. The price must be much higher before they can safely invest.
Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do. If we did we'd all be super rich.

It is simple. Bitcoin with 1MB blocks is a revolutionary development in censorship resistant and Stateless, money. It commands a marketcap of over 10Billion USD and is more popular than it has ever been.
Increasing the blocksize will shake up the economics of mining and running a node. 2Mb isn't bad, but an uncapped blocksize limit, or a very large limit, or a dynamic limit would cause a downward spiral of centralization.
I was one of the original organizers of the community driven "Stress Test" last year. I was extremely concerned about the effect backlogged transactions would cause. However we went through several stress tests, and the sky never fell. The mempool filled up 100+Mb and the network held solid.
I don't really care about "Mainstream" adoption from a currency standpoint. Bitcoin is digital gold to me. It is a mitigation against inflation and global uncertainty. 
If it ends up costing $100 per transaction I'll use other layers to transact with or coins that cost less for transactions, but I won't get rid of my bitcoin. I'd just top up Altcoin wallets as necessary. 
So in a nutshell, increasing the blocksize limit will impact mining and node economy, very likely to result in more centralization. I don't care about bitcoin being used for microtransactions, there are plenty of other coins for that. The value of this network lies in its decentralization (among many other properties)
Bitcoin is Digital Gold and I don't want to give that up in exchange for microtransactions or increased throughput on the native layer.
I'll ask you this, why do $5 coffee purchases need to be censorship resistant, and how is it you expect that resistance to come for free?
I would not fight against a 2-8MB hardfork if it gains consensus, but I would absolutely sell my coins if the blocksize limit is removed or made dynamic.

Bitcoin must scale; that is for certain; but the sky is not falling.
There are no other coins that are attempting to compete with Bitcoin on the parameters that make people invest for the long term. There are other coins that are competing to be currency and coins competing to enable smart contracts. Bitcoin is the only coin that is attempting to redefine the concept of value and wealth. This seems lost on many Bitcoiners and Crypto enthusiasts even.
There are a few interesting blockchains; several of which that may appreciate in value; but only one blockchain do I believe in as a long-term store of value; and that is Bitcoin.
There is only one coin I believe is and will remain permissionless; uncensorable. 
Even with its problems Bitcoin is still by far the most decentralized coin and ecosystem.
Bitcoin is the only coin I trust to remain finite. Most other coins could more or less be made infinitely inflating because they are not decentralized enough; or have leader heads that can be cut off or corrupted.
That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be working to improve Bitcoin. We have a lot of room for improvement. 
Even if Ethereum is 10x the marketcap of Bitcoin it doesn't make Ethereum the leader of decentralized, permissionless value.
Bitcoin is the anchor to which all other cryptos must eventually settle. Bitcoin is the global ledger; all transactions of value must eventually settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. That is the future. Right now they just seem like isolated Crypto's; they aren't. They are all part of Bitcoin.

This upcoming hardfork will define the Bitcoin landscape for quite some time. For Bitcoin to become global we must increase blocksize maximum. Bitcoin is the global coin, if it is kept at 3TPS it can not scale and will fail global integration. 
What is the best case scenario keeping Bitcoin at 1MB blocksize max? That we achieve 3TPS? Then what? How can we revolutionize global finance at 3TPS? Is there anything I am missing here?
I have skin in the game, and I don't want to lose it during a hard-fork fiasco, but I don't see how Bitcoin can grow much more while constrained to 3TPS. I'd rather lose it trying to make Bitcoin the rails for the new global financial system than maintain it as a niche limited payment method.

Lots of Bitcoin or Lots of Fiat. 
You could sell 10,000 BTC in an instant and fulfill all the buy orders and bring the price crashing down hundreds or even thousands of dollars. You of course will hope that others will panic sell; bringing the price down even lower. Then once the price is much lower than what you sold at; you rebuy say 15,000 Bitcoin for less than you sold your 10,000 BTC for. You end up with an extra 5000 BTC and maybe some cash. Of course that is if the market reacts the way you want it to. It is a gamble. Somebody else with a lot of fiat might say "wow this is a really good deal" and buy up all the coins; preventing the price from crashing further. This just causes the person trying to crash the market to lose tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
It is a much more fair kind of manipulation than what happens on the Stock market. I guess I would call it more "gaming" than manipulation. Individual whales, groups of investors, corporations, miners, exchanges are all free to try to game the Bitcoin market.
Gaming the Bitcoin market is available to anyone who wants to try their hand at it. Whereas manipulating the stock market is limited to privileged parties; exchanges, banks, privileged government employee's.

I feel that continuing to push this erroneous narrative that pools = miners is just plain disingenious.
For that long article, they very briefly touched on the fact that pools are actually collections of miners.


I'm not sure how you can claim that miners choose pools based on payouts not on politics. Sure most miners are selfish, but that also means protecting their profit interests. When GHash.io was approaching 50%, did miners leave because of GHash payout structure, or politics?
It seems that our short history directly contradicts the viewpoint that miners marry themselves to pools based on payout structure. Our short history seems to indicate that miners are conscious individuals that understand they have the power to vote with their hardware and electricity.
Popper knows enough about Bitcoin and its history to not make these kinds of claims, he isn't ignorant, he's pushing a narrative.

Bitcoin isn't perfect; but the criticism repeated in every rBitcoin thread is not rational criticism of the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin asset, or the Bitcoin ecosystem. They are emotional bits of spam meant to make others emotional and drive discussion off topic.
Its a way to push conversation and sentiment more towards one side. It is similar to political discourse. Most people are relatively centered on any political spectrum ; but the louder and more radical one side is; the more it pushes the center of discussion towards that direction.
If we can't get the spam and trolling under control the only solution to balance discussion is to flood every medium and outlet with radical discourse from the other side of the spectrum.

That will be where consultants and Bitcoin banks can come in. Nothing wrong with that; personally I think it would be a fun challenge to create a custodial (100% reserve) Bitcoin bank.

Bitcoin is genius because Satoshi found a way to make greedy behavior useful, self-sustaining, and even into a positive feedback loop.
Bitcoin is an attempt to turn the tragedy of the commons on its head; at least in some regards. It may not be perfect in every aspect; but more or less peoples desire for profit align with increasing the strength of the network.
Bitcoin is designed assuming that everyone are greedy thieves that would steal and lie without hesitation. If we can make a highly secure, self-sustaining; self-bootstrapping network that actually relies on assuming people will be greedy thieves; we've really accomplished something amazing.
Consider that banks and corporations need all these legal structures, laws, prisons, etc in order to keep their legacy systems from crumbling. The legacy system is fragile; Bitcoin is anti-fragile.

This kind of thinking is not sound. Things do not have "room to grow" because their price is lower.

I suppose it isn't that difficult; I just swept in a bunch of old wallets a few weeks ago.
But the point still stands; you will have to sweep them into a wallet somewhere; might as well have the wallet you spend from be as secure as possible. Unless you are only swiping in small amounts at a time; but that would not be efficient. 
Right now unless you just import your private key rather than sweeping it; you will have to pay two transaction fee's to spend from a paper wallet. One fee to sweep it; and one fee to spend it.
At the end of the day all hardware wallets are backed up by a paper wallet. So everyone should be familiar with paper wallets; how to create them securely; how to sweep them, and how to spend from them.

I'd say the framework laid out in the White Paper is more analogous to the development of the ARPANet framework rather than Email.

What about all those pricing in doomsday scenarios where miners go bankrupt and the network stalls to a halt?
The halving is a major event in Bitcoins history. This is the first halving since Bitcoin has become a billion dollar asset and since mining has been semi-professionalized. There are uncertainties surrounding this event and I would imagine many are pricing this uncertainty into their investment strategy. If the halving goes off without a hitch I would be shocked if within 6months we do not see a 10-20% increase in price.

And remember there is no perfect security; just increasing steps that you can take.

You are just comparing apples to oranges now. Of course we accept that we trust many layers of organization when we use custodial accounts maintained by others. I don't trust people to not try to hack into my bank account; but I do trust that the bank will try to get my money back for me. Because bank money is not real it is much easier to undo compared to Bitcoin. I would rather take extra precautions with my Bitcoin because there is no bank or anybody that can get it back once it is sent to an address you dont control.
Bitcoin is designed such that we need not trust anyone beyond the code and our own understanding. It is only natural that we should seek to eliminate all avenues through which we may lose money.
I keep repeating that Trezor is a great product but that if you are securing a lot of wealth you will want to at least consider the pros and cons of building your own hardware wallet versus trusting a prebuilt hardware wallet.
This is how I would arrange wallets from least secure to most secure:

Wouldn't Blockstream be exactly that? 
It is much easier to risk your time and money developing something that has a clear profit potential rather than developing something that hopefully increases the underlying value of the assets you hold. It is a form of tragedy of the commons. 
If we all just acted altruistically for the betterment of society without concern for profit the world would be a much better place and we would all be much more wealthy. But when you have to feed your family a guaranteed paycheck is a lot more valuable than working for a cause that if successful will eliminate global hunger forever.

Multi-Signature wallets are an amazing and massively under-utilized method of storage.
We should be using Multi-signature wallets as the default recommendation for securing coins; rather than just a simple hardware or paper wallet.

These quick plummets seem to be indicative of one of three options:
1) Panic Selling
2) Market Manipulation
3) Fat Finger/Mistake
A smart trader will not sell 100 or 1000 coins all at once. You will get a far better price for your Bitcoin by selling little by little. The only reason you would sell so much all at once is if you are panicking (anticipating further losses) or if you are trying to move the market down.
So this was either panic selling (why panic after new ATH); market manipulation; or a fat finger mistake.
I'm going with market manipulation followed by panic selling.

If you want to save money on a hardware wallet get a RaspberryPi 2 an SD card and a flash drive.
Install your desired wallet software (Electrum, Mycellium, etc) on the RaspberryPi; and then disconnect from the Internet permanently.
Then generate your keys offline. Take the masterpublic key from the RaspberryPi wallet; and on your Online PC enter this Master Public Key into a "watch only" wallet.
You can now craft unsigned transactions on your online PC; save to USB; load + sign transaction on the raspberryPi; re-save to USB; then broadcast the signed transaction on the online PC.
I know it sounds complicated but after you've done it once or twice is actually very straightforward.
If you've got spare cables and extra keyboard/mouse you can make this Hardware wallet for less than $50.

The difficulty readjustment differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin makes the comparison tenuous at best.
Bitcoin takes 2000 some odd blocks to readjust difficulty; so a chain that has only 10% of the hashing power could take 4months or more to readjust difficulty; which could certainly be enough to kill it off.
We also have high profile Bitcoiners on all sides of the debate that may decide to dump coins they don't believe in. 
It is even possible that Satoshi comes back to dump the coins on the chain they believe doesn't represent Bitcoin.
I wish it was as straightforward as what happened with Ethereum.

Bitcoin is not ready for non-technical people. If you really have no idea how to follow what I've said; you probably should keep your exposure limited.
Its fine if you want to play around with a few hundred or even a couple thousand dollars. 
If you are securing tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars simply trusting some 3rd party to do your security for you is going to end in tears for many.
We don't know what the risk of some kind of attack is. If you're only securing a small amount of Bitcoin then you can take bigger risks. As time goes on hopefully that small amount becomes worth more and more; and the incentive to steal greater and greater. Better to setup your storage solutions securely from the get-go.
I think hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger are fantastic parts of the ecosystem; but they are not foolproof security.

It sounds like you're saying that since 75% is easier to reach it is a more realistic scaling solution.
95% is chosen because Bitcoin needs consensus in order to change; while 75% is certainly a supermajority; we don't want Bitcoin to change with the whims of the majority.
Bitcoin is to become a force of nature; not a force of politics. 
The scaling dilemma is one of Bitcoins first real temptations to give in to majority politics; and it is a real test for Bitcoin. 
If Bitcoin changes merely because a majority of any party wants change; it demonstrates that Bitcoin is not beyond politics; that there is a mechanism by which Bitcoin can be controlled by majority rule.
This upsets its status as an immutable ledger, and brings into question the possibility of change of any and all other key protocol features.
Bitcoin must prove that it only makes changes when there is nearly unanimous consensus. Precisely because of the impossibility of everyone agreeing is what makes it valuable.

I don't know why so many people are mistaking this statement for meaning that Satoshi literally discovered the essence of free market capitalism. What I am saying is that he developed an incentive system and a framework in software that fundamentally assumes people behave in a self-interested way. It is very different from systems that rely on people playing nice and obeying the rules. Bitcoin is engineered to turn that self-interest into strengthening the network by increasing the hashrate; or wanting to secure their coins with their own node; or investing in bitcoins early on just incase because deflation. These things are all self-interested behaviors that generally increase the strength of the network. 
Satoshi didn't invent capitalism of course; but they did invent a framework that is fueled and strengthened by it.

I've been ranting to my family about Bitcoin for years. Once I started investing in 2014 I began ranting even more. Never from a 'get rich' perspective; but from a 'change the world' perspective. Constantly being called delusional and ridiculed by my family. 
Now at a recent family gathering I find out that several members of the family now resent me because Bitcoin is prospering. Members that I've been trying to educate since Bitcoin was in the $200's.

One of Bitcoins main advantages over traditional investments like stocks and other forms of abstract ownership; is that Bitcoin can be "physically" transferred securely and almost instantly anywhere in the world.
Because other investments do not have this property (including bank dollars) ; it is extremely common for financial institutions to sell more assets than they actually have available to sell (because taking physical ownership is nearly impossible). This inflates the number of assets and depresses their prices. 
With Bitcoin we can keep exchanges and custodians honest by forcing them to transfer Bitcoin to our own private keys. It is impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin transaction; but it is completely trivial to take your money and show you a balance on a website.
Withdrawing coins en-masse forces exchanges to come clean ; either they have as many Bitcoin as they claim or they don't.
 If companies like Coinbase are using your USD and your Bitcoin to fund their operations to lobby the government against your investments; that is belligerent behavior ; the kind of mentality that creates such perverse belligerent behavior would likely see no issue running a massive fractional reserve.
It should be noted that many times in Bitcoins history exchanges have been operating incompetently or fraudulently ; resulting in total or near total loss of funds. Regular "bank runs" on Bitcoin custodians should be a normal state of affairs.

I'm arguing that a pre-manufactured hardware wallet with the single express purpose of storing someones Bitcoins is far less secure than a general computer that is programmed by the end user to store Bitcoins.
The intended use of every single Ledger or Trezor is to store Bitcoin (money) on. 
The packages could be intercepted and replaced with illegitimate Hardware wallets that appear legit; and only after X coins are sent to it does it then steal your coins.
Or the companies that produce them could be corrupt; either internally; or forced to through a national security letter. They could make the hardware in such a way that limits the keyspace; such that all they keys generated fall within such a small keyspace that every key could be compromised.
People generally buy hardware wallets for larger sums of Bitcoin; but I think it should be pointed out that a pre-configured hardware wallet is not trustworthy for sums more than several thousand dollars worth.
With a pre-configured hardware wallet you are placing trust in the company who made it and trust in every hand that helped ship to your door.
With a self-configured hardware wallet you are placing trust in yourself and your own understanding.
I personally feel safer storing coins on Coinbase rather than in a pre-configured hardware wallet. That said I feel infinitely safer with my redundant, geographically distributed, hardware, multisignature wallet, than with coins on Coinbase.

Coinbase is a bank that allows you to purchase Bitcoins.
Coinbase is not a wallet.
Coinbase does not hold your coins for you.
Coinbase will send you coins to an address you control. 
Until the coins are in an address that you exclusively control the private key to (and it has been confirmed several blocks in) then all Coinbase has is a promise to send you Bitcoin.
It is not like money in your bank account. Bank money can be willed into and out of existence by the bank.
Bitcoins cannot be willed into and out of existence by Coinbase. 
You should only keep coins on an exchange or online "wallet" if you intend to sell them or trade them very soon; and you should not have more Bitcoins in addresses you don't control than you are comfortable losing completely.

No coins seriously compete with what Bitcoin offers. There are coins that try to offer features that Bitcoin doesn't offer; but no coin is seriously competing with Bitcoin for the status as a decentralized, permissionless, immutable ledger/Network that uses a finite token (bitcoin).
Other coins are not either not decentralized; are mutable; are infinitely inflating, require permissions. No coin seriously competes with Bitcoin as a basis of money/value. Other coins may compete in the currency space; or in the smart contract space; but even those are IMO foolish investments. If Bitcoin activates SegWit almost all the features other coins offer can be offered on Bitcoin. Those other coins will collapse so fast the bubble bursting will be heard around the world.

Bitcoin is transferring wealth to the high tech, paranoid, intellectual class. 
We have to wrestle control of civilization away from old, slow, stupid, violent humans with access to vast wealth. We are doing that by redefining money itself. 
The smart Old money will of course not fight too hard but will ride the wave with us. Stupid, Violent Old Money will fight tooth and nail this re-definition of Money.
Bitcoin is financially empowering those with technical knowledge and skills.
We are making money so complex that true power will ultimately reside in knowledge and understanding of Money itself.
It is essentially just replacing the Financial class with the Financial Technology Class.
Tyrants will be dependent on those who understand how to move and store money securely; true power will rest with the FinTech class. If money is ultimately finite then having FinTech rule the world may not be so bad. If money can be infinitely inflated by the FinTech class then we are certainly in for a world of authoritarian hurt.

You shouldn't put your eggs ALL into one basket. Some people here like to keep all their liquid assets in Bitcoin rather than hold money in a bank account. Many are young people who can afford the loss, and many have other assets.
You should never invest more (in anything) than you can afford to lose. You should only invest so much that you are still be able to make all your payments and continue living your life normally even if the price goes to $0.
But if the choice is between holding digital fiat in a bank account, or controlling the private keys to a digital asset, I think many of us feel more comfortable holding a volatile asset than a promise by a bloodsucking banking system.

Just because something is anti-fragile does not mean that there won't be attempts to damage or destroy it. 
What anti-fragile means is that the result of these attacks will make Bitcoin stronger; rather than weaker.
Bitcoin is designed to be anti-fragile; and up to this point it really has been. Part of the anti-fragility is the chaos; disagreement; soapboxing; grandstanding; hyperbolic alarmism that you see here. Some people freaking out about the miners and selling their coins or making other decisions is part of the ecosystem.
Whether Bitcoin continues to prove to be anti-fragile is still yet to be determined; and it is certainly possible that we may have to tweak the gears and levers of the incentive structure to ensure it remains anti-fragile.

A hardware wallet like those offered through the link in OP are great devices; but are inferior to a true DIY hardware wallet.

In general you will want to verify your download is legitimate. There are several means but probably the most secure is by comparing digital signatures.
When people release new versions of wallets; prominent developers will "sign" the code and produce a digital signature. You can then find developers published "public keys" which will allow you to determine if the digital signature is in fact valid.

There definitely are people who have used their profits to fund new business ventures. I know a few entrepreneurs who started new businesses which accept and promote Bitcoin with their profits. Every new business and service that accepts Bitcoin helps grow the economy.
Before 2013 many of the people involved in Bitcoin were cypherpunks, privacy advocates, and of course darknet market users. Before 2013 only the most visionary and brave entrepenuers invested significant time and money into developing products for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Over the past few years Bitcoin has established itself; many more people understand its potential; and the user base is far wider than cypherpunks and darknetmarket users. There are many more capitalistic/entrepreneurial users involved since 2013 and I think that if Bitcoin continues to hold this high value/increase in value; we will see many new business ventures bankrolled by Bitcoin.

I'm not trying to say Ledger or Trezor are Bad. They are Good devices.
What I am saying is that they have a larger attack surface than a general purpose computer that is then re-purposed for storing Bitcoins.
An insignificant % of Pi's will ever store any Bitcoin on it. The same can be said for all general computers.
The vast majority of Ledgers and Trezors will store Bitcoin on it.
This makes it a much better target than general purpose computers.
I didn't realize there was any polling of security experts on this issue; could you link me to it?
Again I'm not trying to say that Ledger or Trezor are not good devices; they are. What I am trying to say is that if you bought $20k worth of Bitcoin (and that is a lot to you) then a Trezor or Ledger is not ultimate security.
If you have enough invested in Bitcoin that it would change your life if you lost it; you owe it to yourself to understand the protocol well enough to be able to secure the coins on your own.
