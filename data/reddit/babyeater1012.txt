Just hit $4050USD

Bitcoin drops 50% of its value everyday?
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:39:03
Tomorrow around midday.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:11:34
Could you point me to that information?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:06:15
That's probably more realistic
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:55:54
I'm not sure if I'd be willing to convert my whole paycheck. Can I do a partial?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:53:38
No need to be rude. I am asking if BTC drops 50% or more of its value everyday.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:37:41
Why $5500/$3500? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:03:12
That's fair but how often has a &lt;50% decrease in value happened in BTC's inception? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:56:20
Based off of what data?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:45:09
Isn't BTC decentralized? So no one actually owns BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:19:56
Download an app called Coinbase. Connect your bank account or credit card. Then buy bitcoin.

Just bought at $7967. It's back up to $7995
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:35:10
Cash and Gold are dead.

We watch this immediately after Thanksgiving dinner lol. 
You might not have to wait that long to put in a pool.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:21:08
Too soon. GDAX has it at $7,987.435 right now 20:20 EST
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:27:41
That's a good idea!
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:23:24
$7990, almost there. Dipped to 8001$ usd five minutes ago.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:58:08
Yup, got my buy target set. Now we wait.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:45:50
Enjoy your karma!
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:59:48
I could buy a $30 LEGO set hahaha
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:12:22
I sold all mine at $4600 and made a cool $77.
